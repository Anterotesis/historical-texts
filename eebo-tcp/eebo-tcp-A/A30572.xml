         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Yea they did not only bleſſe God, but the Text ſaith, <hi>They lifted up
their hands, and they bowed their heads, and worshipped the Lord with
their faces to the ground.</hi> Why? becauſe the book of the Law was read
to them and expounded. How comes it to paſſe that their hearts were ſo
taken with it now to hear the book of the Law expounded to them? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it was becauſe they were newly returned out of their Captivity; and
now they came into their owne Land, and heard the Law of God opened
to them, they bleſſed his great Name, &amp; bowed their faces to the ground,
worshipping him. This day (my brethren) witneſſeth to us our great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
and returne from our bondage. It was not long ſince that wee
could have either Ordinances, or Truths, or Religious exerciſes, but onely
according to the humors of vile men: But now through Gods mercy a
great deliverance is granted to us (as this day witneſſeth) that wee may
come and have free liberty to exerciſe our ſelves in the Law of our God:
O doe you bleſſe the Lord, and bow your faces to the ground, worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of him.</p>
               <p>In the 12. <hi>verſ.</hi> of that <hi>Chap.</hi> we read, that after they had heard the Law
read and expounded to them, they <hi>went their way to eate and to drink,
and to ſend portions, and to make great mirth:</hi> Why? <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſaith the
Text) <hi>they had underſtood the words that were declared unto them.</hi> I
hope if God shall pleaſe to give in aſſiſtance unto this work, many of you
shall goe away hereafter from this Aſſembly rejoycing, becauſe you will
come to know more of Gods mind revealed in his word then formerly:
And this will be the comfort of your meat and drink, and of your trading,
and the very ſpirits of all the joyes of your lives.</p>
               <p>As the ſweetneſſe of the fruit comes from the graft, rather then from the

                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 7. 17.</note> Thus did they, for <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. when they
found it vvritten in the book of the Law, that the children of Iſrael should
dwell in booths in the feaſt of the ſeventh moneth, (This was one paſſage of
the Law that was expounded, how they should keep the feaſt of Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles,
and what booths they should make) the people went forth preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unto the mount, and fetched Olive branches, and Palm branches, and
branches of thick trees, and made themſelves booths, every one upon the

truths to the times wherein we live, the Lord grant you obedient hearts to

               <p>I muſt not retard the work, nor your expectations any longer with large
prefacing to it, only ſomewhat have been ſaid about the rules for interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Scripture; I will ſay no more of that but this, to interpretation of
Scripture, a Scripture frame of heart is neceſſary, a heart holy &amp; heavenly,
ſutable to the holineſſe &amp; heavenlineſſe that is in the word: as it was ſaid of
<hi>Tullies</hi> eloquence, that nothing but the eloquence of <hi>Tully</hi> could ſet out the
excellency of it: So it may be ſaid of the Scriptures ſpiritualneſs, nothing
but a heart filled with Scripture ſpiritualneſs can ſet forth the excellencies
of it: and becauſe the authority of Scripture is dreadfull, wee deſire the
prayers of you all to God for us, that his feare might fall upon our hearts
that ſeeing we are menfull of errour, and full of evill, yet howſoever wee
may not bring any Scripture to the maintenance of any erroneous conceit
of our own heads, nor any evill of our own hearts: This wee know to be a

dreadfull evill. It was a fearfull evill for <hi>Lucifer</hi> to ſay, <hi>I will goe and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend

come down to juſtifie any erroneous opinion, or any way of evill they goe
about to make the bleſſed God and the holy Ghoſt to be the fathers of lies.
It is counted a great evill in a Common-wealth to put the Kings ſtamp upon
falſe coine; and to put the ſtamp of the Spirit of God upon an error, upon
a conceit of a mans owne, is certainly a great evill before the Lord: and it

               <p>You may judge of your profiting in grace by the delight you finde in

But notwithſtanding Iſrael was thus notoriouſly wicked, and given up

               </p>
               <p>His errand was to convince them clearly o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> this their abominable Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
and thoſe other abominable wickedneſſes that they lived in, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
to denounce threatnings, yea moſt fearfull deſtruction. (This was
not done before by the other Prophets, as wee shall afterward make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
but it was <hi>Hoſea</hi> his errand to threaten an utter deſolation to Iſrael
more than ever was before) and yet withall to promiſe mercy to a rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to draw them to repentance, and to Propheſie of the great things
that God intended to doe for his Church and children in the latter dayes.</p>
               <p>What was his Commisſion?</p>
               <p>The words tells us plainly, <hi>The word of the Lord came to Hoſea.</hi> It
was the word of <hi>Iehovah.</hi> It is a great argument to obedience to know it
is the word of the Lord that is ſpoken. When men ſet reaſon againſt
reaſon, and judgment againſt judgment, and opinion againſt opinion, it
prevails not: but vvhen they ſee the authority of God in the Word, then
the heart and conſcience yeeldeth. Therefore hovvever you may look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

It is <hi>the word of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this <hi>word of the Lord,</hi> it <hi>came to Hoſea.</hi> Mark the phraſe, <hi>Hoſea</hi>

whom the commiſſion came, to put them in the place wherein they were.
So the word of the Lord came to <hi>Hoſea.</hi> The knowledg of a call to a work,
will help a man through the difficulties of the work. One of the notableſt
Texts of Scripture to encourage a man to that work to which he ſees he is

Lord have called thee in righteouſneſſe:</hi> what follows then? <hi>I will hold
thy hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant to the people,
for a light to the Gentiles.</hi> If wee know Gods call to a work (as for the
preſent this of ours is exceeding clear unto us) though the worke will be
difficult and liable to much cenſure, Yet the Lord will hold our hands, and
will be with us, and with our minds, and our tongues, and our hearts, and

But the principall buſineſſe is to enquire of the time when <hi>Hoſea</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied.
You have it in the Text, <hi>In the dayes of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah, Iotham, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haz,
and Hezekiah Kings, of Iudah, and in the dayes of Ieroboam the ſon
of Ioaſh King of Iſrael.</hi> It is computed by Chronologers, that <hi>Hoſea</hi> lived
about 814. years before Chriſt: In his time was the City of Rome built.
It was the beginning of the Olympiads. <hi>Euſebius</hi> tells us that there was no
<hi>Grecian</hi> Hiſtory (and if no <hi>Greek</hi> learning, then not any that was of any
authority) extant before this time of <hi>Hoſea.</hi>

                  <hi>Vzziah, Iotham, &amp;c.</hi> You ſhall
find that we shall have much of Gods mind revealed in this, more then at

a very long time, it is very probable fourſcore years, but it is certaine
he was in the work of his Miniſtry above ſeventy yeares, and I make that
clear thus, He propheſied in the dayes of <hi>Ierobam</hi> (who though he be here
named laſt, yet he was the firſt of theſe Kings, and we shall shew you the
reaſon by and by, why he was named laſt) that then took up ſome of his
time: But ſuppoſe you reckon from the end of <hi>Ieroboams</hi> reign, yet from
that to the beginning of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> here were 70. years, and yet the Text
ſaith he propheſied both in <hi>Ieroboams</hi> time, and in <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> time too:
after the death of <hi>Ieroboam, Vzziah</hi> lived 38. years (he reigned 52. in all)
He began his reign in the 27. of <hi>Ieroboam, 2 King.</hi> 15. 1. Now <hi>Ieroboam</hi>
lived after that 14. years, for he reigned 41. in all, take 14. out of 52. and
there remains 38. and after him <hi>Iotham</hi> reigned 16. years; and then
<hi>Ahaz.</hi> ſucceeded him, and reigned ſixteene yeares more: ſo that
between theſe two Kings, <hi>Ieroboam</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> there was 70. yeers,
in which <hi>Hoſea</hi> propheſied, beſides the 41. yeers of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> and 29.
yeers of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> in both whoſe reigns too you ſee he lived, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is probable it was 80. yeares at leaſt that <hi>Hoſea</hi> continued in the
work of his propheſie. See what of Gods minde we have that will ſpring
fresh from this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hoſea</hi> continued ſo long,<note place="margin">Obſ. 1.</note> and yet you ſee there is not much of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie
extant, only 14 short Chapters. It pleaſeth God ſometimes that
ſome mens labours shall abide more full to poſterity than others, though
the labours of thoſe others more large, and as excellent as theirs: this is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the diverſity of Gods adminiſtrations. Let the Miniſters of God
learn to be faithfull in their worke, and let God alone for to make them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
by having their labours extant.</p>
               <p>2. It appears from hence that <hi>Hoſea</hi> muſt needs begin to propheſie ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
young.<note place="margin">Obſ. 2.</note> If hee were a Prophet 80. years, certainly hee was but young
when he began firſt to propheſie, and yet he was ſet upon as great an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
as any of the Prophets were (as we shall ſee hereafter.) It plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
God ſometimes to ſtir up the hearts of young ones to doe him great
ſervice, he ſends ſuch ſometimes about great works and employments, ſo
he did <hi>Samuel,</hi> and <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> and <hi>Timothy,</hi> therefore let no man deſpiſe
their youth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:42662:7"/>
3. <hi>Hoſea</hi> propheſying thus long,<note place="margin">Obſer. 3.</note> it appeares hee lived to be old in his
work. When God hath any work for men to doe, he doth lengthen out
their days. So he did the days of <hi>John</hi> the Diſciple, he lived near upon an
hundred years, if not more, for the time of the writing of his Goſpel (as it
is noted) was in the 99. yeare of Chriſt, 66. after the Aſcenſion. Let not
us be too ſolicitously carefull about our lives, to maintain our healths and
ſtrengths, let us be carefull to doe our worke; for according as the Lord
hath work for us to doe, ſo he will continue to us our health and ſtrength,
and life: when you come to dye, you may dye comfortably, having this
thought in you; well, the work that the Lord ſent me to doe, is done, and
why ſhould I ſeeke to live longer in the world? God hath others e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to do his work. It was a ſweet expresſion of <hi>Iacob, Gen.</hi> 48. 21.
<hi>Behold I dye</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>but God shall be with you, and bring you againe
unto the land of your fathers.</hi> So may the Prophets of God ſay that have
been faithfull in their work: Behold I dye, but the Lord shall be with you,
my work is finiſhed, but God hath others that are young, to goe on in his
work, that is the third <hi>Obſervation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. You may ſoe by <hi>Hoſeas</hi> continuance in ſo many Kings reigns,<note place="margin">Obſer. 4.</note> that
hee went through variety of conditions; ſometimes he lived under wicked
Kings, ſometimes under moderate Kings, ſometimes hee had encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from godly and gracious Kings, although they were of Iudah. Not
only the people of God, but ſpecially Gods Miniſters muſt expect variety
of conditions in the world, they muſt not promiſe to themſelves always the
ſame ſtate.</p>
               <p>Yet further. <hi>Hoſea</hi> propheſied in all theſe Kings reigns. Here appears
the conſtancy of his ſpirit, notwithſtanding the many difficulties hee met
withall in his work: for he propheſying in <hi>Jeroboams, Iotham,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haz</hi>
his time who were wicked Princes, ſurely he muſt meet with many
diſcouragements; And though he continued 80. years, yet he ſaw but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
ſucceſſe of his labour, for the truth is, the people were never converted
to God by his Miniſtry.</p>
               <p>Nay it is apparent that they grew worſe and worſe, for it is ſaid of that
<hi>Ieroboams</hi> time in which <hi>Hoſea</hi> began his Propheſie, only that hee did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
in the ſight of the Lord, and continued in the wayes of <hi>Ieroboam</hi> the ſon
of <hi>Nebat, 2 King.</hi> 15. 15. But after wee read moſt horrible things that
Iſrael was guilty of, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17. 17. It is ſaid, <hi>they cauſed their ſonnes and
their daughters to paſſe through the fire, and uſed divinations, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments,
and ſold themſelves to doe evill in the ſight of the Lord, to
provoke him to anger,</hi> beſides many dreadfull things, you may read in that
Chapter, Iſrael was grown guilty of. This vvas in King <hi>Hoſhea</hi> his time,
which was many years after <hi>Hoſea</hi> began to propheſie, towards the end of
his Propheſie.</p>
               <p>God may continue a Prophet a long time amongſt a people,<note place="margin">Obſer. 5.</note> and yet
they may never bee converted. It is a diſtemper in Miniſters hearts
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42662:8"/>
to think to give over their work becauſe they ſee not deſired ſucceſſe. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<hi>Latimer</hi> in one of his Sermons, ſpeaking of a Miniſter, who gave
this anſwer, why he left off Preaching, becauſe he ſaw he did no good, this
ſays <hi>Latimer</hi> is a naughty, a very naughty anſwer. That we have here
may be a great ſtay to theſe who have lived many years in the work of the
Miniſtry, and yet have done little or no good. <hi>Hoſea</hi> was fourſcore yeers
a Prophet to Iſrael, and yet did not convert them. Yet notwithſtanding all
theſe diſcouragements, he continued conſtant, and that with abundance
of freſhneſſe and livelineſſe when he comes to the end of his prophecying.</p>
               <p>It is an honour to the Miniſters of God,<note place="margin">Obſer. 6.</note> that meet with many difficulties
in their way, and with many diſcouragements, yet to continue freſh and
lively to the very end; not to be freſh and lively only at firſt, as many yong
Miniſters are when they begin firſt. O how freſh are they, how full of zeal
and activity are they then? but after they have been a while in their work,
or when they have gained what they aimed at, then they grow cold, and
that former vigour, freſhneſſe, and zeale, which appeared to be in them,
comes to be a great deale flatter. Like ſouldiers, that at the firſt were
forward, and active in ſervice, but afterward come to live upon their pay,
and can doe no ſervice at all; or rather as veſſels of wine, that when they
are firſt tapped are very ſmart, and quick, and nimble, but at laſt grow
exceeding flat: as we commend that veſſel of wine that draws quick to the
very laſt of all: ſo it is an excellent thing indeed for a Miniſter of God to
continue freſh, and quick, and lively, to the laſt end. It is true, nature and
naturall abilities may decay, but a ſpirituall freſhneſſe may appear, when
naturall abilities are decayed. To ſee an old Prophet of God, that hath
gone through many difficulties, and ſufferings, and yet to continue freſh &amp;
lively in the work of the Miniſtry, and to have ſpirituall excellencies ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle
in him then, this is a moſt honourable ſight, and calls for abundance of
reverence.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>Hoſea</hi> prophecyed ſo long that he came to ſee the fulfilling of
his Propheſie, for he continued propheſying till <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> time, and in
the ſixth year of <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> reign came the deſtruction of Iſrael. <hi>Hoſea</hi>
had threatned an utter taking of them away, but all this while it was not
done till then, and then it is moſt likely he ſaw the fulfilling of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie.</p>
               <p>It pleaſeth God many times to let his Prophets ſee the fulfilling of their
threatnings upon the people againſt whom they have denounced them.<note place="margin">Obſer. 7.</note>
Perhaps they goe away, and ſcorn, and contemn the Prophets, and their
words are but winde with them, but God many times lets his Miniſters
live to ſee their words fulfilled upon them. For particular perſons, when
they are caſt upon their beds of ſickneſſe or death, it is then ordinary for
them to ſay, Oh the word of the Lord is true that I heard at ſuch a time, it
is now come upon me. So God dealt with the people in <hi>Jeremies</hi> time,
they laughed and contemned him, but <hi>Jeremy</hi> lives to ſee the fulfilling of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42662:8"/>
thoſe threatnings at laſt. And if they live not to ſee the fulfilling of their
words, yet preſently after their death they are fulfilled, as it was at Hippo,
where <hi>Auſtin</hi> threatned judgements againſt them, they were not execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in his time, but preſently after he was taken away, they came.</p>
               <p>Yea but he did not only propheſie in theſe Kings dayes, but in the dayes
of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> King of Iſrael. Here are three Queſtions:</p>
               <p>1. What is the reaſon that <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> who in truth was the firſt of theſe
Kings, that he is named laſt?</p>
               <p>2. Why only one King of Iſrael is named, and three Kings of Judah?
for beſides him in the time of <hi>Hoſea's</hi> propheſie there were 6. other Kings
of Iſrael, <hi>Zechariah, Shallum, Menahem, Pekahiah, Peka, Hoſhea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Why <hi>Jeroboam</hi> is named at all?</p>
               <p>One anſwer will be ſufficient for the two firſt Queſtions, why <hi>Jerobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi>
is named laſt, and why there is but one King of Iſrael named. The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
is this, God took no great delight in the Kings of Iſrael, for they had
forſaken the true worſhip of God. Though there was much corruption in
<hi>Judah,</hi> yet becauſe they kept to the true worſhip of God, God took more
delight in Judah then in ſrael. Therefore hee nameth <hi>Jeroboam</hi> in the laſt
place, though he was firſt, and only him.</p>
               <p>But why was <hi>Jeroboam</hi> named at all?</p>
               <p>This is of great uſe. You ſhall finde that it was for this end, that you
might underſtand what eſtate the people of Iſrael were in at this time of
<hi>Hoſea's</hi> Propheſie. Much you ſhall ſee is to be learned from hence. The
ſtate of the people of Iſrael in the time of <hi>Jeroboams</hi> reign was very proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
though their wickedneſſe was very great. For if you look into 2 <hi>K.</hi>
14. you ſhall find there, that a little before this they had been in very great
diſtreſſe, and under ſore afflictions: Now in <hi>Jeroboams</hi> time they were
in the greateſt proſperity that ever they had been in: for this <hi>Jeroboam</hi> was
not the firſt <hi>Jeroboam</hi> the ſon of <hi>Nebat,</hi> that cauſed Iſrael to ſin, and was
a means of the rent of theſe Ten Tribes from the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> that was
140. years and more before this; but this <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> in whoſe time God
ſent <hi>Hoſea</hi> to propheſie this greatwrath againſt the houſe of Iſrael, was the
ſonne of <hi>Joaſh.</hi> Now in all this time this Kingdome was never in a more
proſperous condition then in the dayes of this <hi>Jeroboam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two things are to be obſerved concerning the condition of this people
at this time.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That they were a little before this in great adverſity, and then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they grew upto great proſperity. For if you read that 14. Chap. of 2
<hi>Kings,</hi> you ſhall find that they were under ſore affliction, for the Text
ſaith, <hi>verſ. 26. There was not any ſhut up, nor any left, nor any helper for
Iſrael.</hi> It is a compariſon taken from Shepheards, that uſe to ſhut up their
flocks when they would keep them ſafe from danger; but now here was
ſuch a generall deſolation and wofull affliction upon Iſrael, that there was
none ſhut up, nor no helper left. But then comes this <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> and it is
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42662:9"/>
ſaid, <hi>ver. 25. That he reſtored the coaſt of Iſrael from the entring of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>math
unto the Sea of the plain.</hi> And <hi>ver. 28. He recovered Damaſcus
and Hamath, which belonged to Judah, for Iſrael.</hi> This <hi>Hamath</hi> that
he ſpeaks of was of great uſe, it was the in-let of the Aſſyrians, and for <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam</hi>
to conquer that place, land to recover <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> and to add that
to the Crown of Iſrael, which belonged to Judah, it ſhews that after their
bitter affliction, God granted a great mercy by <hi>Jeroboams</hi> means, and
that now Iſrael flouriſhed greatly, and grew exceeding proſperous. There
is much of Gods mind held out to us in this: As, in that the people of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
had been under ſore affliction, and delivered, yet God ſent <hi>Hoſea</hi> to
them, to ſhew them their horrible wickedneſſe, and to threaten deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>Hence ſee the perverſeneſſe of the children of men,<note place="margin">Obſ. 1.</note> that after great deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances
granted them from bitter and ſore afflictions, yet they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
ſtill in their wickedneſſe and rebellion. The Lord grant this may
not be true concerning us. God hath delivered us in great meaſure from
thoſe ſore and bitter afflictions, and heavy oppreſſions, under which wee
lately vvere, and many gracious liberties are reſtored to us; Now have we
not need of an <hi>Hoſea</hi> to be ſent unto us to rebuke us, and to threaten judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for the evill of our wayes? This is a ſad thing.</p>
               <p>Further,<note place="margin">Obſ. 2.</note> God may let a ſinner continue a long time in the way of his
ſin, and when he hath flouriſhed many years, and thinks ſurely the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of death is paſt, then God may come and threaten judgment. <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi>
reigned 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. years, and it cannot be but that <hi>Hoſea</hi> propheſying ſo
long after <hi>Jeroboams</hi> death, came in the latter end of <hi>Jeroboams</hi> time. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam</hi>
might think, what doth he come to conteſt with me, and to tell
me of my ſin and wickedneſſe, and to threaten judgment? have not I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
theſe 40, years King, and have proſpered? and ſurely God hath
been with me. Well, a ſinner may hold out long, and yet afterward judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
may come.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Obſer. 3</note> A people in a flouriſhing condition, when they proſper moſt,
and overcome their Enemies, and have all according to their hearts deſire,
even that may be the time for God to come out in his wrath againſt them.
So it was here, therefore we muſt not judg our Enemies to be happy, nor
feare them becauſe of their flouriſhing eſtate for the preſent, neither let us
be ſecure our ſelves becauſe of the mercies wee enjoy. God doth not
alwayes ſo, but ſometimes he is pleaſed thus to deale with ſinners, to ſtay
till they be at the height of their proſperity, and then to come upon them,
as here he did.</p>
               <p>Sometimes God is more ſudden, it is like <hi>Zechariah</hi> the ſon of this <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam</hi>
thought he might venture as well as his Father, his Father proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in ſuch wayes 41 years, and why may not I? No, God came upon
him in ſix moneths, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 15. 8.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Hoſea</hi> when he came to propheſie againſt Iſrael, he ſaw them
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42662:9"/>
in their proſperity, and yet continueth to threaten judgment againſt them.
It was a further argument of the Spirit of God that taught him, and of a
ſpeciall inſight he had into the mind of God, that he ſhould thus propheſie
deſtruction to them when they were in the height of their proſperity. It is
true, if <hi>Hoſea</hi> had come afterward in <hi>Zachariah</hi> his dayes, when the
Kingdome was declining; or if <hi>Hoſea</hi> had popheſied in <hi>Shallums</hi> time,
and others after him, then he might have ſeene by the working of ſecond
cauſes, that the kingdome was going downe indeed. No, but he comes
in <hi>Jeroboams</hi> time, when there was no appearance of ſecond cauſes at all
of their deſtruction, and then propheſieth deſtruction unto them.</p>
               <p>It is a ſign of ſpeciall inſight the ſoule hath in the wayes of God,<note place="margin">Obſer. 4</note> that can
ſee miſery under the greateſt proſperity. The Prophet did not think Iſrael
in a better condition, becauſe of their outward proſperity. A ſigne his
propheſie was from God.</p>
               <p>Yet further, this being in the reign of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> when they were in
great proſperity, ſurely their hearts were exceedingly hardned againſt the
Prophet; and it cannot be imagined, but that they entertayned his prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
with ſcorn and contempt: for it is an uſuall thing, when men are in the
height of their pride, and in their ruffe, then like the wild aſſes colt, to ſcorn
and contemn all that comes againſt them.</p>
               <p>It is nothing for a Miniſter of God to deale plainly with people in the
time of adverſity, when they are down the wind, but when men are in the
ruffe of their pride, and in all their jollity, to deale faithfully with them
then, this is ſomething, and thus the Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> did.</p>
               <p>That their great proſperity did raiſe up &amp; harden their hearts with pride
againſt the Prophet,<note place="margin">Obſer. 5</note> it appears plainly, if you will but read <hi>Amos</hi> 7. 10.
(for we muſt finde Gods minde by comparing one place with another)
there you ſhall find what the fruit of <hi>Jeroboams</hi> proſperity was, for <hi>Amos</hi>
and <hi>Hoſea</hi> were contemporary. When <hi>Amos</hi> was propheſying, <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziah
the Prieſt of Bethel ſent to Jeroboam King of Iſrael, ſaying, Amos
hath conſpired againſt thee, the land is not able to beare his words.</hi> This
was ſaid of <hi>Amos,</hi> it is like that <hi>Hoſea</hi> did not meet with better meaſure
then this. <hi>Amaziah</hi> the Prieſt of <hi>Bethel</hi> did this. If there be any enemies
againſt the faithfull Miniſters in a place, they are the Prieſts of <hi>Bethel,</hi> i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous
and ſuperſtitious Miniſters. And what courſe doe they take?
They ſend to the King, to the Governours, O they have conſpired againſt
the King, they are ſeditious perſons, factious men, that keep a ſtirre in the
kingdome, and break the peace of the Church, the Land cannot bear their
words. Such a meſſage as this you ſee did <hi>Amaziah</hi> ſend concerning <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos;</hi>
he turns off all from himſelf to the King, and all the puniſhment
that muſt be inflicted upon <hi>Amos,</hi> muſt be in the name of the King. And
mark the 12. <hi>ver.</hi> of that Chap. <hi>Alſo Amaziah ſaid unto Amos, O thou
ſeer, goe, flee away into the land of Judea, and propheſie there.</hi> We are not
holy enough for you forſooth, we are Idolaters, we doe not worſhip God
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42662:10"/>
aright, we are no true Church, get you to Judah among your brethren, and
<hi>propheſie not any more here at Bethel,</hi> why? Becauſe <hi>it is the Kings Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
&amp; it is the Kings Court.</hi> It ſeems then in thoſe times, that the Kings
Chappell, the Kings Court could not beare with a faithfull Prophet. And
what was the ground of it, but becauſe at this time <hi>Jeroboam</hi> proſpered in
his way, and the kingdome was in ſuch a flouriſhing condition as it never
was before? Here then was the tryall of the faithfulneſſe of <hi>Hoſea's</hi> ſpirit,
yet to goe on in the work of his Propheſie.</p>
               <p>Yet further.<note place="margin">Obſer. 6.</note> In that <hi>Hoſea</hi> did propheſie in the time of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> by
that it will apppear that he was the firſt Prophet that ever brought theſe
hard tidings to them, of the utter deſtruction of Iſrael, It will appeare by
that which is ſaid, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 14. 27. that before this time God had not ſo
threatned Iſrael; for the Text ſaith: <hi>The Lord ſaid not before this time
that he would blot out the name of Iſrael from under heaven, but hee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
them by the hand of Jeroboam the ſonne of Joaſh.</hi> Mark, there is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the reaſon why the Lord ſaved them by the hand of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> becauſe
he had not yet ſaid he would blot out the name of Iſrael from under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
that is, the Lord never before ſent any of his Prophets thus plainly and
fully to declare his intention to them for the utter blotting out th name of
Iſrael, upon their going on in their ſins. So that it is clear, that <hi>Hoſea</hi> was
the firſt that was ſent about this meſſage. And certainly it was ſo much
the harder, he being the firſt of all. For they might have ſaid, why do you
come with theſe new things, and in ſo great ſeverity, who did ever ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you? It was a hard task: For we know if a Miniſter come with any
thing that ſeems to be new, if he preſents any truth to you that hath but a
ſhew of Novelty, that you heard not before, though it be never ſo good
aud comfortable, he ſhall find little encouragement. Nay if hee doe but
come in a new way, as this very exerciſe, becauſe it is like to goe on in a
way that yet hath been diſuſed, it will meet with many diſcouragements.
What then will the threatnings of hard things, of judgments, and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
do when they come with novelty? Surely <hi>Hoſea</hi> had a hard taske
of this, and yet he went on faithfully with it.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the time wherein <hi>Hoſea</hi> propheſied.</p>
               <p>Now to make a little entrance into the propheſie.</p>
               <p>The beginning of the word of the Lord by Hoſea.</p>
               <p>Some from theſe words doe gather that <hi>Hoſea</hi> was the firſt Prophet
that ever was, Though it is true, we cannot gather it directly from hence,
yet it is apparent, that notwithſtanding <hi>Iſaiah</hi> be ſet firſt, yet <hi>Hoſea</hi> was
before him; for if you look into the 1 Iſa. you ſhall find that his beginning
was in the dayes of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah.</hi> Now <hi>Hoſea</hi> was in the dayes of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi>
and <hi>Jeroboam</hi> was before <hi>Vzziah.</hi> And this may be one reaſon why
though I intend the whole propheticall books, yet I rather pitch upon <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea</hi>
firſt, becauſe indeed he was the firſt Prophet: it is cleare you ſee from
the Scripture, though we cannot gather it from theſe words in this ſecond
<hi>verſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:42662:10"/>
But yet thus much we may gather from theſe words, <hi>The beginning of
the word of the Lord by Hoſea,</hi> that this was the beginning of his prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie.
And what was this beginning? what did God ſet him about firſt?
Mark preſently the next words, <hi>he muſt take him a wife of whoredomes,
and children of whoredomos, and ſo declare to the people of Iſrael that
they had committed great whoredome departing from the Lord.</hi> The moſt
grievous charge, and moſt ſevere and terrible expreſſion of Gods wrath
againſt that people that you meet with in all the book of God. This is the
work <hi>Hoſea</hi> muſt doe, and <hi>Hoſea</hi> was very young when firſt he went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it. Now as I told you before, God ſometimes calls young ones to
great ſervices; but to call a young man to this ſervice, to goe to this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
with ſuch a meſſage, now in the midſt of all their pride and flouriſh
to conteſt with them thus, &amp; to tel them that they are children of whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
and no longer the people of God, for what? for a young man to
do this? Why, they might have ſaid, if this came from the mouth of
ſome old ancient Prophet, reverent for his years, and experience, it had
been ſomewhat; but to come from a green head, for an upſtart to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

us with ſuch vile things. Thus men grown old, and ſodden in their
ſins,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> are ready to reaſon. But let us know (my brethren) if God ſend any
meſſage unto us, though by young ones, he expects your entertainment
of it. When God would deſtroy <hi>Elies</hi> houſe, he ſends the meſſage by
young <hi>Samuel;</hi> but <hi>Eli</hi> did not reaſon thus, what this young boy come
to ſpeak thus malapartly to me! No, he ſtoops to it, <hi>Good is the word of

                  <hi>Hoſea</hi> muſt tell them that they are <hi>children of whoredomes,</hi>
and not <hi>the people of God.</hi> What for a Miniſter when he comes firſt among
a people, to begin ſo harſhly, and ſeverely, and ruggedly, is it not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to comply with the people, to come with gentle and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>aire means, to
ſeek to win them with love? if you begin with harſh truths, ſurely you
will make them fly off preſently. Thus many do reaſon. Now I beſeech
you take heed to your own hearts in reaſoning thus, Many have done ſo,
and have ſought to comply with people ſo long till they have complyed
away all their faithfulneſſe, and conſcience, and vigour that before they
had: When they come to great men, rich men, men in place and emmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
they will comply with ſuch; but let them have any of Gods people
in their Pariſh that are of a mean rank, and poor, they comply little e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
with them, but are harſh and bitter to them, and regard not the
tenderneſſe of their conſciences at all.</p>
               <p>It is true. If Miniſters have the teſtimony of their own conſciences
that they would take no other way but what ſhall be for the greateſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of their people, maintaining ſuch a diſpoſition as to be willing to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe
any ſufferings that God ſhall call them unto: they may ſay firſt
when they come to a houſe, <hi>Peace be to this houſe,</hi> eſpecially when they
come to a place that hath not had the means before. But if it be to a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:42662:11"/>
that goe directly againſt the light of their conſciences, a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious

that it is againſt the mind of God, and yet only for their owne baſe
ends will goe on and not amend; in ſuch a caſe as this wee may come with

nothing <hi>to them,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aug. de Hoſea l. 18. deciu.</note> but what hath firſt been ſpoken by God <hi>in them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe in this ſecond verſe he comes twice with the ſame expreſſion,
<hi>The beginning of the word of the Lord by Hoſea,</hi> and againe, <hi>The Lord
ſaid to Hoſea;</hi> and yet in the beginning of the firſt verſe, <hi>The word of the
Lord came to Hoſea.</hi> Why all this, three times? All this upon good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
for <hi>Hoſea</hi> was to come with a terrible meſſage to the people, and to
reprehend them with much ſharpneſſe, to tell them that they were <hi>the
children of whoredomes,</hi> and that they had <hi>departed from the Lord,</hi> and
<hi>he would have no more mercy upon them,</hi> but would <hi>utterly take them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</hi>
He had need therefore have an expreſſe command for what he did,
and to have much evidence of the Spirit, that what he ſaid was from God,
and not any thing of his owne ſpirit. When a Miniſter of God ſhall come
and reprehend a people ſeverely for their ſins, and threaten Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
let him then if ever look to it, that he hath a good ground for what
he ſaith, that what he ſhall deliver may be nothing but the word of God in
him, the ſheer word of God, without any mixture of his owne. It is an
ordinary thing in Miniſters in reprehending of ſinne, and denouncing of
threatnings, to mingle much of their own ſpirit and wrath: But if at any
time Miniſters ſhould take heed of mixing their own wrath, then eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
when they are to denounce Gods wrath, then they ſhould bring no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:42662:11"/>
but the word of the Lord; for it being a hard mesſage, the ſpirits of
men will riſe up againſt it, if they once ſee the ſpirit of the Miniſter in it,
they will be ready to ſay as the devill in the poſſeſſed man, <hi>Ieſus I know,
&amp; Paul I know, but who are you?</hi> So they, the word of the Lord I know,

               <p>In the very threſhold, in the entrance of the propheſie you ſee we meete
with a difficulty, a great difficulty. Firſt, a command from God, from
the holy God, unto a Prophet, a holy Prophet, <hi>to goe and take a wife of

the word ſignifieth,<note n="*" place="margin">Such a one as <hi>Thais</hi> was among the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. Vir ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinum.</hi>

a command to take a wife of whoredomes, and can this be from God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Auſtin</hi> anſwereth it thus. Though ſhee had been a proſtitute whore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
yet ſhe might be reclaymed, and ſo ſhee might be called a wife of
whoredomes, from that whoredome that heretofore ſhe was guilty of, and
now reclaymed. And ſo he thinketh that it was a reality indeed, that <hi>Hoſea</hi>
did take to himſelfe a wife of whoredomes, and think to ſalve it up thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theodoret</hi> is ſomewhat angry with thoſe that thinke it was not really

command <hi>Hoſea</hi> to take to himſelfe a wife of whoredoms, and that he did
take ſuch a wiſe, one that was a notorious harlot, ſo <hi>Arius Montanus, Piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator,
Pareus, Tarnovius,</hi> and others, they go that way, and they thinke
to ſalve it only thus, that it is a command of God, and therefore though it
had not been lawfull for <hi>Hoſea</hi> to have done it, yet God commanding it,
he might do it: As they inſtance in other caſes that ſeeme to be ſomewhat
of the like nature, as the children of <hi>Iſraels</hi> robbing the <hi>Egyptians, Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi>
killing his ſonne, and the like.</p>
               <p>If this ſhould be ſo, (as many Interpreters going that way might make
one to thinke it not a thing impoſſible) wee might learne thus much from
it.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> that Gods command takes away all matter of offence. It would
be a notorious offenſive thing for a Prophet, a Miniſter of God to marry
one that is wicked, a wicked whore; yet ſo farre as the offence is, Gods
command is enough to take it away.<note place="margin">Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand takes away the offence, not he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mand of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate.</note> For the ſubject of offence is not du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but indifferency: any thing that is a duty to be done, we muſt goe on in
it, though it be never ſo offenſive to others, that is no rule at all to hinder
us if it be a duty: but if it be a thing of indifferency, then wee muſt ſtop.
Gods command takes away all plea of offence; I ſay not that mans com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
doth ſo, for men, even Magiſtrates themſelves are bound not to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
their brethren, as well as others.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:42662:12"/>
But then it may be ſaid they ſhould command nothing at all, for ſome
or other would be offended, and ſhall not they command, becauſe ſome
weak ones may be offended?</p>
               <p>It is true,<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> that which they may take upon their conſciences to be their
duty, that they are bound to command, and they ſhould ſin againſt God if
they did not command it, and require obedience to it; they muſt doe it
though never ſo many be offended. But in matters that they themſelves
acknowledge to be neither here nor there, either for Gods ſervice or for the
good of a Common-wealth, herein the rule bindeth them as well as others
in regard of offences, to forbear.</p>
               <p>2. Suppoſing this to be a reall thing,<note place="margin">2.</note> we ſee that the Prophet muſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
much in his credit before men, only to be ſerviceable to God for a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
expreſſion of his mind.</p>
               <p>All our credits,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> all our names, and all we are, or have, muſt lie down at
Gods feet to be ſerviceable to him in the leaſt thing; if but in a way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of his mind, much more then in bearing witneſs to his truth.</p>
               <p>3. This being ſo, wee ſee the way of God in putting the Prophet in the
very firſt ſervice upon a very difficult work:<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> It could not but be a thing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
tedious and irkſome to his ſpirit to marry ſuch a one, yet God put
him upon it.</p>
               <p>It is the uſuall way of God, when he calleth any to great ſervices, at the
beginning, to put them to ſuch difficult works, to try them thereby, that
if they goe through them, then they may be confided in, that they will goe
through more afterward.</p>
               <p>But we ſhall rather take this in a way of viſion, as others do; not that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<hi>Hoſea</hi> did really marry ſuch a wife, but this did appeare to him in a
viſion, as if ſuch a thing were really done, onely to declare what the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was at this time in reſpect of God: As if God
ſhould ſay, <hi>Hoſea,</hi> this people of Iſrael is to mee no other then as if thou
ſhouldeſt have a wife that were the moſt notorious whore in the world, and
all their children are to me as if thy children were the children of whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and fornication. And this I conceive to be more directly the minde
of God, and I will not give you my meere conception of it neither, but
reaſons for it why it muſt be ſo.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Reaſons why <hi>Hoſeas</hi> marrying a whore was but only in a viſion. 1.</note> becauſe we find in Scripture that which is hiſtorically related, yet
was done by way of viſion. And it is an uſuall way of Scripture to expreſs
that which is done in a way of viſion, as if it were a hiſtory, as if it were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
done. I will ſhew you two examples for this, one of <hi>Ieremy</hi> when he
was at Jeruſalem, yet the Scripture ſpeaks as if he had been at Babylon:
and the other of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> when he was at Babylon, it ſpeakes as if hee had
been at Jeruſalem. It is as fully related as this is here, and both muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
needs be underſtood as in a way of viſion. Firſt for <hi>Ieremy,</hi> you have
it <hi>Chap. 30. ver.</hi> 4. God requireth there that he ſhould <hi>goe to Euphrates
and hide his girdle there in the hole of a rocke.</hi> But this river was a river
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:42662:13"/>
in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and <hi>Ieremy</hi> was not in <hi>Babylon</hi> at this time, nor in all the time
of the ſiege, nor in the time of the captivity, neither could he goe to <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi>
for the City was now beſieged, and when he did but aſſay but to go
a little way to <hi>Anathoth</hi> his own Towne, he was preſently taken hold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as if he had been a Traytor to his Country. Therefore this which is here
declared as a hiſtory, as if he had really done it, was but only done in a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And ſo <hi>Ezekiel</hi> the other way, hee was at <hi>Babylon</hi> (for he was that
Prophet that propheſied to the people that were carryed captive to <hi>Babylon,</hi>
God ſent a Prophet to them to help them there in their captivity) yet in
the 8. <hi>Chapter</hi> of his Prophecie, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſeemeth to be brought to <hi>Ieremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi>
and he is bidden there <hi>to dig a hole in the wall to ſee the wicked abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
that the ancients of Iſrael did there.</hi> Now <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was not there,
he was at <hi>Babylon</hi> all this while, but it is declared as if the thing had beene
done really. So we are to underſtand <hi>Iſaiah</hi> his going naked 20. dayes,
and <hi>Ezekiels lying three hundred and ninety dayes on the one ſide, and</hi> 43.
<hi>on the other,</hi> Ezek. 4.</p>
               <p>2. That it was a viſion and not really done,<note place="margin">2.</note> the reaſon is, it was Gods
command, <hi>Lev. 21. 7. That the Prieſt muſt not marry with a whore;</hi> &amp; of
all mens wives God is moſt careful of the wives of thoſe that are in the work
of the Miniſtry, that are Church Officers, therefore 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 11. when but
a Deacon is deſcribed what he ſhould be, there is his wife deſcribed too,
that ſhe ſhould be <hi>grave, no ſlanderer, ſober and faithful in all things.</hi> You
never read that when God appointed what a Magiſtrate ſhould be, what
his office ſhould be in a Common-wealth, that hee takes ſuch care to ſet
downe what his wife ſhould be: But when he appointeth the loweſt officer
in a Church, a Deacon, he appointeth what his wife ſhould be too. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the wives of Miniſters ſhould goe away with a leſſon from hence,
and know that God hath a more ſpeciall eye to them, then to the wives of
all the men in the world beſides. God is tender of the credite of the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
of his Church, and ſo ſhould man be; for their diſcredit is a hinderance
to their work.</p>
               <p>Yea further, we read <hi>Amos</hi> 7. 16. that it was threatned as a curſe to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maziah</hi>
the Prieſt of <hi>Bethel,</hi> that <hi>his wife ſhould be a harlot,</hi> for reſiſting
the Prophet: ſhall then the wife of <hi>Hoſea</hi> be a whore? For <hi>Amos</hi> &amp; <hi>Hoſea</hi>
propheſied both at the ſame time.</p>
               <p>And the Scripture ſaith (you know the place,<note place="margin">How the woman is the glory of the man.</note> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.) that <hi>the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
is to be the glory of the man.</hi> What a glory ſhould <hi>Hoſea</hi> have had in
ſuch a match as this? The woman is the glory of the man, How? (for ſo I
deſire not only to open the Scripture that I read here, but as I go along and
quote Scripture, ſo far as may be for your edification, and ſuteable to our
argument to open there too.) In two reſpects ſhe is ſo. 1. becauſe it is a
glory to a man that he hath ſuch an image, for ſhee is from the man, and
as the man being the image of God, ſheweth the glory of God, becauſe he
is the image of God, and from him; ſo the woman being from the man,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:42662:13"/>
and as it were his image, ſhee is the glory of the man. 2. Becauſe man
hath ſuch an excellent creature brought under ſubjection to him: ſo the
woman is the glory of the man. Man is not only made glorious by God,
in that God hath put all other creatures under him, but eſpecially in this,
that God hath put ſuch an excellent creature under him as the woman is, ſo
the woman is the glory of the man. This could not be here in ſuch a match
as this.</p>
               <p>3. It could not be that it was a reall thing,<note place="margin">3.</note> but a viſion from the propheſie
it ſelfe, for then <hi>Hoſea</hi> muſt have ſtayed almoſt a whole yeare before hee
could have gone on in his propheſie: For firſt he muſt take to him a wife of
whoredomes, and beget a child of whoredomes, then he muſt have ſtayed
till the child had been born, before he could have come to the people and
ſay, My child is borne, and his name is <hi>Iezreel,</hi> and it is upon this ground
that I have named him thus, and then hee muſt have ſtayed almoſt a yeare
more before he could have <hi>Locuhamah,</hi> and then after that he muſt ſtay al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
another yeare longer before <hi>Loammi</hi> could be born.</p>
               <p>And laſtly,<note place="margin">Apparens &amp; loquens ei per vifio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uem interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orem ecſtafi.</note> that which is noted by <hi>Polanus,</hi> the expreſſion that wee have
here is, that God ſpake in <hi>Hoſea,</hi> ſpeaking and appearing to him by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
viſion as it were in an extaſie, ſaith <hi>Polanus;</hi> therefore we muſt take
it ſo that this wife of whoredomes that <hi>Hoſea</hi> was to marry, was in a way
of viſion, it was to ſignifie that Iſrael was to God as a wife of whoredoms,
and as children of whoredomes ſhould have been to the Prophet if he had

they were never marryed to God, their idolatry is not adultery;

Hee hath no underſtanding to conſider this. Idolatry is a beſotting ſin as

               <p>For the whole land hath gone a whoring from the Lord.</p>
               <p>In going a whoring they goe a whoring:<note place="margin">Fornicando fornicatur. <hi>or as Arius Montanus</hi> Fornicando fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitur.</note> Or as <hi>Arius Montanus</hi> reads

Some apply it to perfection, that is, a harlot that was perfect and compleat
both in her beauty, and in her fornication and wickedneſſe. The word
likewiſe ſignifieth rottenneſſe, corruption, and conſumption: ſo indeed
are all things in the world; as ſoon as they grow to any perfection, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to decline quickly to corruption. All things but ſpirituall do ſo, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
grow ſtill higher and higher.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Gomer</hi> we will take rather in the ſecond acceptation of it, as it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
rottenneſſe and conſumption.</p>
               <p>Who was this <hi>Gomer?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She was</hi> the daughter of Diblaim.</p>
               <p>The ſignification of that is (according to ſo me) one that dwelleth in the
deſart, in reference to that famous deſart <hi>Diblath,</hi> of which we read <hi>Ezek.</hi>
6. 14. noting the way of Idolaters, that they were wont to goe into woods
and deſarts, and there to ſacrifice to their Idols.</p>
               <p>But rather, according to moſt, <hi>Diblaim</hi> ſignifieth bunches of dryed figs
that were the delicacies of thoſe times, ſo <hi>Oecolampadius,</hi> from which hee
hath this note,</p>
               <p>That rottenneſſe and corruption proceedeth from voluptuous pleaſures,
from delicacies,<note place="margin">Obſ.</note> and the like. Though the pleaſures of the fleſh be very
contentfull to you, yet deſtruction is the fruit of them; deſtruction is the
daughter of ſenſuall pleaſures and delights, of all your delicacies, ſo ſaith
the Scripture, <hi>Rom. 8. 13. If you live after the fleſh you ſhall dye.</hi> Phil. 3.
<hi>ult. whoſe God is their belly, whoſe end is deſtruction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to apply it to <hi>Iſrael. Iſrael</hi> was as <hi>Gomer</hi> the daughter of <hi>Diblaim,</hi>
that is, the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were now neare to deſtruction, and were the
daughters of ſenſuall delights, they gave over themſelves to ſenſuall delights
and pleaſures.</p>
               <p>It is the uſuall way of Idolaters, thoſe that forſake the true worſhip of
God to give up themſelves to the pleaſures of the fleſh. Senſuality and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry
doe uſually goe together. When the people of Iſrael ſacrificed to
the calves, what did they? <hi>They eate and dranke, and roſe up to play,</hi> that
was all their worke, and good enough for the worſhipping of ſuch a god,
a calfe.</p>
               <p>You know the more we began to decline in the worſhip of God, we
began to be ſo much the more ſenſuall, there muſt be Proclamation to
people to take their ſports and delights upon the Lords day; And indeed it
is that which doth uſually accompany defection in the way of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.
Falſe worſhip doth not lay ſuch bonds upon mens conſciences for
the mortifying the luſts of the fleſh, as the worſhip of God doth. Therefore
thoſe men that love moſt to take liberty to the fleſh, they are thoſe that are
ſooneſt enticed to ways of ſuperſtitious worſhip.</p>

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42662:15"/>
to this, and the more confirming this interpretation, that <hi>Iſrael</hi> was as
<hi>Gomer the daughter of Diblaim,</hi> that is, rottenneſſe, the daughter of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality.</p>
               <p>Thus for the Mother. But now the ſon that is begotten of this mother, it
is <hi>Iezreel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Call his name Iezreel.</p>
               <p>The Prophet muſt give a name to his ſon. It is that which belongeth to
Parents to give names to their children. Godfathers and Godmothers (as
they call them) are of no uſe for this, or for any thing elſe that I know;
and in ſuch holy things as Sacraments are, we muſt take heed of bringing

               <p>But here we are to enquire, Firſt, the ſignification of this name, Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the reaſon why the ſon of <hi>Hoſea</hi> muſt be callied by this name, <hi>Iezreel.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, to ſhew that <hi>Iſrael</hi> had loſt the honour of his name, and was

               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3.</note> 
                  <hi>Jezreel,</hi> to ſhew the way that God intended to bring judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

               <p>It is a ſpeciall way of Gods bringing judgement upon a Kingdome,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> by
ſcattering of them. We read, that when <hi>Micaiah</hi> ſaw the deſtruction of

<hi>all Iſrael ſcattered one from another as ſheep that have no ſhepheard.</hi>
There is a two-fold ſcattering;<note place="margin">A twofold ſcattering of a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> A ſcattering among our ſelves in wayes of

us already, and in this ſenſe we may be called <hi>Jezreel.</hi> Oh how is our
Kingdome divided! how is it ſcatted? The Lord keepe us from the other
ſcattering, that wee be not ſcattered one from another, by being forced to
flye for our lives before the Enemy. It is juſt with God that if wee ſcatter

quite the contrary way. As thus, <hi>Jezreel,</hi> it ſignifieth indeed ſcattered of

and ſo the Jewes were ready to take the name <hi>Jezreel,</hi> and would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to own it, becauſe it ſignified the ſeed of God; And hence it commeth
to ſignifie ſcattered too, becauſe that ſeed is to be ſcattered when it is ſown:
And hence it was that they might glory ſo much in that name. Oh! they
were the ſeed of the Lord, in an abiding condition, as being ſowen by the
hand of God himſelfe: No, ſaith God, you are miſtaken, I doe not call
you <hi>Jezreel</hi> upon any ſuch tearms, becauſe you are ſowen of mee, but

You may read the Hiſtory of it in 2 <hi>King. Chap.</hi> 9, 10, 11. (for the
way of opening the Prophets is to compare them with the Scriptures that

It was the bloud of the houſe of <hi>Ahab,</hi> the bloud of <hi>Iezabel,</hi> the bloud of

               </p>
               <p>Indeed this to an outward view at firſt is one of the ſtrangeſt things wee
have in all the book of God. If you compare this place here in <hi>Hoſea</hi> with
other Scriptures, you ſhall find that it is a ſtrange thing that ever it ſhould
be ſaid that the Lord would avenge the blood of <hi>Ieſreel</hi> upon the houſe of
<hi>Iehu.</hi> For in 2 <hi>King.</hi> 9. 7. you ſhall finde that <hi>Iehu</hi> was anointed by the
Lord on purpoſe for that action, to ſhedd that bloud, and he had a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
from God, he was bidden to goe and ſhed it, and the holy oyle
was poured upon him, for that end that he might ſhed that bloud; yet now
this bloud muſt be avenged, and avenged upon the houſe of <hi>Iehu.</hi> Yea
<hi>Chap. 10. v.</hi> 30. you ſhall find that God ſaith, becauſe he had done ſuch
a thing, &amp; ſhed the bloud of the houſe of <hi>Ahab</hi> in <hi>Jeſreel,</hi> that he would
reward him for it, and that his children to the fourth generation ſhould
ſit upon the throne of Iſrael, and governe that Kingdome. Now that
which <hi>Jehu</hi> was anointed to doe, that which he was commanded to doe,
that for which God afterward rewarded him for doing; now God ſaith
he will avenge it, and avenge it upon his houſe. What ſhould be the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of this?</p>
               <p>There are three reaſons why God would avenge this bloud upon the
houſe of <hi>Jehu.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Three rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why God aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the blood of <hi>Iezreel</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the houſe of <hi>Iehu.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe though <hi>Jehu</hi> did it, yet he rather looked at himſelfe and
his owne ends than at God in it, his ayme was to get the Kingdome to
himſelfe, but he never aymed at God in the work, therefore God ſaith hee
will avenge it upon his houſe.</p>
               <p>2. Becauſe though he did that which God ſet him about; yet he did it
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:42662:17"/>
but by halves. Indeed he deſtroyed <hi>Ahabs</hi> houſe, but he ſhould have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
<hi>Ahabs</hi> Idolatry too, but he did not doe that, and therefore now
God commeth upon him.</p>
               <p>Yea 3.<note place="margin">3.</note> Though he were made <hi>Ahabs</hi> executioner for his Idolatry, yet
he proved <hi>Ahabs</hi> Succeſſor in his Idolatry. He was Gods rod in puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Ahab,</hi> but he yet continued in the ſinnes that <hi>Ahab</hi> did commit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
now God ſaith, <hi>hee will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the houſe
of Jehu.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From hence we have moſt excellent obſervations, that doe ſpring natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
as a fountaine bubleth up freſh and ſpringing water. I will but only
ſhew them to you, and ſo paſſe them over.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Obſer. 1.</note> That a man may doe that which God commandeth, and yet
not obey God. He may doe that which God would have done, and yet
not pleaſe God. He may doe what God requireth, and yet ſerve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
therein, and not God.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Obſer. 2</note> A carnall heart is contented to goe ſo farre in Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
as will ſerve his owne turne, but there hee ſtoppeth. So farre as
might ſerve the bringing up of <hi>Iehu</hi> to the Crowne of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Obedience ſo farre as ſerves a mans owne turn.</note> to the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of him on the Throne, ſo farre hee goeth in the way of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
but no further. Such a heart is like to the hand of a ruſty dyall:
Suppoſe a ruſty dyall hath the hand ſtand (as now) at tenne of the clock,
come and looke upon it now, and it ſeemeth to goe right, but it is not
from any inward right frame of the clocke it doth ſo, but by accident;
for ſtay till after tenne, and come againe at eleven or twelve and it ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
ſtill as before at tenne. So let God command any thing that may hit
with a mans owne ends, with his owne way, and be ſutable to him, and
a man ſeems to be very obedient to God; but let God goe on further, and
require ſomething elſe, ſomething that will not ſerve his turn, that will not
agree with his owne ends, and here God may ſeek for a ſervant, as for him
he will goe no further.</p>

haſt done, God may curſe thee hereafter even for the ſinfulnes of thy heart
in that work which for the matter of it was good. God may reward thee
for the matter of thy work, but curſe thee for the manner of it.</p>
               <p>6. It is a moſt dangerous thing for men to ſubject the workes of God

the whole heart, for all our good is in God, &amp; therefore all our hearts muſt
make out after God. God muſt have per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ect obedience in the deſire and
endeavour, or elſe he will have none. Certainly that which muſt make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
man acceptable, it is not ſo much that there is ſomewhat done, but is
there that which God calleth for done? or is it done in regard of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour?
for that indeed will be acceptable: though we cannot doe all at
once, but it we bring somewhat to God as a part, and acknowledge the
debt as the whole, and ſo are working for the other, it will be accepted.
As ſuppoſe a man owes you an hundred pound, and bringeth you but fifty
pound in part of payment, yet if he acknowledg the reſt, and promiſe the
payment of it., if you know hee will be faithfull in the payment of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he will accept of it: But if a man bring you fourſcore pound in liewe of
all, you will not accept it. So it is here, Hypocrites they ſay they cannot be
perfect in his world, and ſo think to put off God with a little; it is true, if
thou hadſt an upright heart, and didſt bring God but part, and labourſt
after the whole, hee would accept of it: But if thou bringeſt him ten times
more then a ſincere heart can bring him, it will not be acceptable, no not
ninety nine pounds will be accepted if brought in ſtead of the whole. God

whereas <hi>Jehu</hi> did many memorable things in his warlike affairs, yet none
more then that he did by his bow. Mark that place, 2 <hi>King. 9. 24. And
Iehu drew a bow with his full ſtrength, and ſmote Jeroboam between his

               <p>Carnal hearts truſt much in their warlike weapons,<note place="margin">Obſerv.</note> but they are nothing
when God commeth to break a peoples ſtrength. God hath the power of
all Ammunition, the Lord is called <hi>The Lord of Hoſts,</hi> (and he delighteth

But ſecondly, becauſe when they are uſed, they can have no ſucceſſe at all

               <p>My brethren, why then need the Church of God feare the ſtrength of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:42662:21"/>
weapons, the Bow, the Cannon, or all the Ammunition of the enemies of
the Church,<note place="margin">No wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons can proſper againſt the Church.</note> ſeeing our Lord is the Lord of Hoſts? no weapon can be uſed
or have ſucceſſe but by this Lord of Hoſts. He can break the bow, though
of ſteele, when pleaſeth, and can give his people ſtrength to doe ſo too.
For this you have an admirable promiſe, <hi>Eſa. 54. 17. Behold</hi> (ſaith God)
<hi>I have created the ſmith that bloweth the coals in the fire, and bringeth
forth an inſtrument for his worke, and I have created the water to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy.
No weapon that is formed againſt thee ſhall proſper.</hi> What need
the Church fear then? God breaks the bow when he pleaſeth: For as God
hath a providence over all the things in the world, ſo there is a ſpecialty of
providence of God to order Battels, to give the victory, not to the ſtrong,
or to the multitude, but ſometimes to the weak and few, even as hee plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth.
And therefore hee is the Lord of Hoſts, becauſe though his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence

God in warlike affairs.</p>
               <p>But what was this <hi>valley of Jezreel?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is worthy our time to enquire after this valley of Jezreel, wherein
God will break the bow of Iſrael. There were two places called Jezreel,
the one belonging to Iudah, <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 15. the other belonging to Iſrael, <hi>Ioſh.</hi>
17. 16. &amp; <hi>Chap.</hi> 19. 18. Iezreel was a fruitfull valley, ten miles long, and
by it there was a famous City built, which was in <hi>Ahabs</hi> time the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
ſeate, the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of the Kingdom, and there was a glorious tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in it, &amp; from thence they might ſee over <hi>Galilee</hi> and over <hi>Iordan.</hi> Now
there were two great Cities that belonged to the tenn Tribes, <hi>Samarea</hi> and
<hi>Iezreel,</hi> as we in <hi>England</hi> have two principall Cities, <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Yorke.</hi>
But this Iezreel was the moſt fortified, in which they put a great deale of
confidence, yet God ſaith here, <hi>He will break the bow of Iſrael in the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
of Iezreel.</hi> That is, there by that City in that place, that they accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the great ſtrength of their Kingdom, there he would break the bow of
Iſrael.</p>
               <p>Fortified Cities cannot help when God cometh out againſt a people.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> Fortified places are nothing where the wrath of God is out againſt a people.</note> If
we can fortifie our Cities againſt ſin, we may ſoone fortifie them againſt
an Enemie. If ſinne once get in, the enemie will quickly follow. <hi>Nah.</hi> 3.
12. <hi>All thy ſtrong holds ſhall be like fig-trees with the firſt ripe figs; if
they be ſhaken, they ſhall fall into the mouth of the eater.</hi> You ſhall with
the leaſt wind like the firſt ripe figs ſall off, all your ſtrong holds ſhall doe
ſo. Yea, <hi>ver. 13. Thy people in the midſt of thee are women, the gates of thy
land ſhall be ſet wide open to thine enemies, the fire ſhall devourthy bars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You ſee what the valley of Iezreel is, &amp; the meaning of it. But why will
God <hi>breake the bow of Iſrael in the valley of Jezreel?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are theſe two reaſons for it. 1. Becauſe God would deale with
this people of Iſrael, as Judges deale with Malefactors; they will hang
them up there where the fact was committed, as wee ſee ſome hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up in Chains neer to the City, at or about the place where their villany
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:42662:22"/>
was done. So in <hi>Jezreel</hi> was ſhed the blood of <hi>Jezebel,</hi> and the blood
of the 70. ſons of <hi>Ahab,</hi> and the blood of <hi>Jehoram,</hi> and there will God
break the bow.</p>
               <p>Hence it is that guilty conſciences are many times afraid to goe neere to
the places where they have committed wickedneſs, becauſe their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
will fly in their faces, for feare God ſhould come upon them in the
place where the fact was done.</p>
               <p>But further,<note place="margin">2.</note> He will break the bow of Iſrael in the valley of <hi>Jezreel,</hi> that
is, in that fortified place in which they did ſo much glory (this is ſpecially
obſervable.)</p>
               <p>Even in that place wherein a kingdom ſhall moſt glory,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Obſer.</hi> God puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes men in that they moſt glory in.</note> &amp; ſeem to truſt
moſt in, God many times doth come and break the kingdom in that very
place, and makes that the breaking of the kingdome moſt. <hi>Nah. 3. 8. Art
thou better then populous No, that was ſcituate among the rivers, that
had the waters round about it, whoſe rampant was the ſea, &amp; her wall was
from the ſea?</hi> Mark, a people juſt like England in this caſe: what we o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome
by the Enemie? we that have the Seas for our Wall, and ſuch a
multitude of people amongſt us? Theſe have been &amp; are the two pleas that
England hath for her ſelfe, becauſe our people are many, and we have the
ſeas for a wall: <hi>But art thou better then populous No? yet was ſhe carryed
away, ſhe went into captivity,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. Thus the Prophet pleadeth
with them.</p>
               <p>But further, Theſe truſted in <hi>Jezreel,</hi> they ſeemed to ſcorn the Prophet
What, the kingdome of Iſrael ceaſe, what thinke you of <hi>Jezreel,</hi> ſuch a
ſtrong place as that? juſt as we ſhould ſay, what, an Enemy come to us
what ſay you to London, a brave City, a ſtrong City? what ſay you to the
Ammunition, to the Militia, to the ſtrength that is there? Are they not
able to reſiſt all that can come againſt it? Have we cauſe to feare danger?
It is true, the kingdom hath cauſe to bleſs God for London, and London
hath not yet been the valley of <hi>Jezreel,</hi> but an <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the ſtrength of the
Lord, &amp; hath prevailed with God, as an inſtrument: &amp; therefore we bleſſe
God for that we have had. But yet let us not truſt in that we have, for even
in London, in the valley of <hi>Jezreel</hi> the bow may be broken, and God
knows how to bring things about ſo as to make the Ammunition of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
to be broken in pieces, and turned againſt themſelves: Oh therefore
do not truſt here. Only let it be your care you of this City of London that
you prove not the valley of Jezreel, and then we ſhall do well enough, our
bow ſhall not be broken. What attempts have there been to have made
London by this time the valley of <hi>Jezreel,</hi> that is a ſcattered vally, to have
brought diviſions in this City, that it might be a ſcattered people; &amp; wo to

               <p>Sometimes the very children of families, and in a kingdom do bear this
impreſſion upon them, that God will have no mercy upon this family, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this kingdome. One may (my brethren) read ſuch an impresſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the children of many great families in this Kingdome,<note place="margin">Obſer. 1</note> when wee looke
upon that horrible wickedneſs of the young ones that are coming up, how
different from their former religious Anceſtors; we may ſee with tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

with this family, I intend no further mercy to this family. As ſometimes
when we ſee in a family gracious children, gracious young gentlemen, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

I intend mercy to it.</p>
               <p>It was not long ſince that we might,<note place="margin">Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from gracious youth in England.</note> and we thought indeed wee did ſee
ſuch an impreſſion upon the young ones of this kingdome, the young ones
in the City, the yong ones in the chief families in the Country; that we vvere
afraid that <hi>Lornhamah</hi> to England was written upon them, for oh the rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes

now; now in regard of that graciouſneſſe, that forwardneſſe of ſo

the great ground of the hope we have for mercy to England, is the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

wherein God will ſay,<note place="margin">The feares of the Saints that heretofore mercy was departed from us iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified.</note> Now I have done, I have done with this people,

truth is, that thoſe that laboured moſt to ſearch Gods minde in his word,
they were even afraid that this decree had been gone out upon us in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
It is true, God hath ſeemed for the preſent to tell us that hee hath a
prerogative, and he will have mercy upon whom he will have mercy: But
yet neither are thoſe altogether to be blamed, that even in their own hearts
determined (as it were) that mercy was gone; except they did wholly li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
God, and left nothing of prerogative at all to him, but becauſe it was
Gods ordinary way; and except God had wrought with us in a way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
otherwiſe than ever he did with any nation before, they did then
conclude that the decree was gone forth; and ſo it might be true, and what
God may do with us yet we do not know. But this we can ſay, if the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree

What then if the mercy of God that ſhould ſtop miſery be taken away?
whither ſhould the poore creature goe if mercy be gone? to what creature
ſhould it look for help? if it cryes to any creature, the creature ſaith, I can
afford no comfort, becauſe God affordeth no mercy: what ſhall uphold
the heart then when it hath no hope at all? It muſt needs ſink.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I will not add mercy</hi> (ſaith God) ſhewing, that what good they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
before it was from his mercy, though they would take no notice of
it; well, ſaith God, you ſhall have no more, you have taken no notice that
it was my mercy that helped you before, but when my mercy is gone, then
you will know it,<note place="margin">Obſer. 4.</note> but then I will not add more. Men beſt know what the
worth of mercy is, when mercy is taken away from them, when God ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
no more.</p>
               <p>Again,<note place="margin">Obſer. 5</note> 
                  <hi>I will not adde mercy.</hi> God doth not uſe to take away his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
fully from a people or from a ſoul: but when mercy hath been ſhewed
and abuſed, after much mercy hath been received, and that being abuſed,
then God ſaith hee will not adde more. You have a parallel place to this,
<hi>Iudg. 10. 16. I will deliver you no more,</hi> ſaith God, I have delivered you
many times, my mercy hath been abuſed, I will deliver you no more. It
is juſt with God when mercy is abuſed, that wee ſhould never know far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
what mercy meaneth. Mercy as it is a precious thing, ſo it is a tender
thing, and a dangerous thing to abuſe it. There is nothing that more quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
works the ruine of a people or of a ſoule, then abuſed mercy.</p>
               <p>But further, <hi>I will utterly take them away.</hi> Before it was only that they
ſhould be ſcattered, the name of the firſt child before was but <hi>Iezreel,</hi> that
they ſhould be <hi>the ſcattered of the Lord;</hi> but the 2. is <hi>Loruhamah, that

way for his wrath by leſſer afflictions, before hee cometh with deſtroying
judgments. I remember Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> in his Hiſtory of <hi>Scotland</hi> hath this
ſtory of one Sir <hi>Iames Hamilton,</hi> that having been murthered by the Ks.

and ſtrikes off both his arms, with theſe words, Take this before thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a finall payment for all thy impieties, and within 24. hours 2. of the
Ks. ſons dyed. God cometh to nations &amp; particular perſons with a ſword,
cutteth off arms before he takes their lives, he commeth by degrees upon
them. As the Lord when he cometh in a way of abundance of mercy, leſſer
mercies make way for greater mercies. When Manna was rained down,
the dew ever came before it: So, leſſer judgments to the wicked are fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners
of, and makers way for greater judgments; firſt they are parboild
before they come to be roſted in the fire.</p>
               <p>Further, <hi>I will not adde mercy to the houſe of Iſrael.</hi> He doth not ſay, I
will not adde mercy to this or that particular man of Iſrael, but <hi>to the houſe

               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:42662:25"/>
A Multitude of ſinners, with God is no argument for their eſcape of
judgment. It is a rule indeed with man, <hi>Multitudo peccantium, tollit pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum,</hi>
Multitude of offenders take away their offences;<note place="margin">Obſer. 7</note> Men know not
how to execute the offenders when they are in Multitudes, here and there
ſome of the ring-leaders may be taken for example ſake. But it is no rule
with God, though it be the whole houſe of Iſrael, God hath no <hi>mercy</hi> for the
whole houſe of all the people of Iſrael. Let no man preſume to ſin againſt
the Lord, becauſe there are Multitudes that do offend, &amp; think that he ſhal
eſcape with the Multitude. No, all the nations of the world with the Lord
are but as <hi>the drop of a bucket,</hi> &amp; as <hi>the ſmall duſt of the ballance, nothing,
even leſſe then nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet further, <hi>No mercy upon the houſe of Iſrael:</hi> Though it be the
houſe of Iſrael, yet no <hi>mercy</hi> upon her. If it were the houſe of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> it
were not ſo much,<note place="margin">Obſer. 8</note> but what, no <hi>mercy</hi> to the houſe of Iſrael? The neare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of any to God exempts them not from the wrath of God. God hateth
ſin,<note place="margin">Amos 3. 2.</note> and hateth ſin moſt when it is neareſt him: <hi>You have I knowne of all
the families of the earth, therfore wil I puniſh you for your iniquities, ſaith
the Lord.</hi> As we hate a Toad in our boſoms more then when it is at a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
diſtance; ſo God hateth ſin in thoſe that are neareſt to him more than
in thoſe that are further off; for <hi>God will be ſanctified in all thoſe that
draw neer unto him.</hi> But wherefore is all this that God wil have no more
<hi>mercy</hi> upon the houſe of <hi>Iſrael?</hi> what hath the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> done, that
God ſhould be ſo angry with it? It is worth our ſearching and enquiring
after, why the Lord will at this time have no <hi>mercy</hi> upon the houſe of <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el.</hi>
It concerns our ſelves neerly.</p>
               <p>The firſt and main reaſon is, becauſe of their continuance in their falſe
way of worſhip, notwithſtanding all the means that God had uſed to bring
them off; not only by his Prophets, ſending them again and again to ſhew
them the evill of their falſe worſhip in thoſe 2. Calves in <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi>
but by moſt remarkable works of his providence againſt them. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.
The work of God againſt <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> when hee was but ſtretching
out his hand againſt the Prophet that came to denounce judgement againſt
that Altar upon which he was offering Sacrifice,<note place="margin">1 Kings 13. 4.</note> his hand that he put forth
againſt him dryed up, ſo that he could not pull it in again to him, and upon
the prayer of the Prophet it was reſtored &amp; became as was before. Again,
the remarkable work of God in anointing <hi>Iehu</hi> to deſtroy the houſe of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab</hi>
and his ſeed for their Idolatry. Yet notwithſtanding theſe Prophets,
and theſe works of God, with many other, they ſtill perſiſted in their way
of Idolatry. And this cauſed the Lord now not to have <hi>mercy</hi> upon the
houſe of Iſrael.</p>
               <p>Let us take heed of this, God hath uſed, and ſtill doth uſe means to bring
us off fully from all wayes of falſe worſhip, not only by ſending his Miniſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
from time to time to declaim againſt ſuch things, but by wonderful and
remarkable works of his providence towards England, eſpecially at this
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:42662:26"/>
day. Never had any Nation, never had <hi>England</hi> heretofore more remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable
works of God to draw them off from all wayes of falſe worſhip, to
bring them to worſhip God in the right way according to his will. Now
let us tremble at this ſentence; <hi>I will not add mercy, I will have no more
mercy.</hi> God hath added mercy to us again and againe from time to time.
And now me thinks in this work of Gods <hi>mercy,</hi> that he is about concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us,<note place="margin">Exod. 33. 5</note> he ſpeaks to us as he did to the people, <hi>Come and put off thy orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that I may know what to do with thee.</hi> Come now and humble
your ſelves that I may know what to do; As if God ſhould ſay, Come &amp;
give in your laſt anſwer.<note place="margin">A dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous thing to reiect an offer of mercy after reiection of former of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers.</note> Certainly in that way that God is now in with us,
he calleth <hi>England</hi> to give its laſt anſwer, as if he ſhould ſay, Now I am
ſheing <hi>mercy</hi> once more, take heed of rejecting it, leſt you have a <hi>Loru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamah</hi>
upon you, <hi>I will adde no more mercy,</hi> conſider not onely what wee
have done, but what we do, how we have abuſed <hi>mercy,</hi> and how wee doe
now abuſe preſent <hi>mercy;</hi> how oppoſite the ſpirits of moſt are againſt the
work of reformation now in hand, who even ſay to the Lord Chriſt depart
from us, we deſire not the knowledg of thy ways. When the people of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
were offered <hi>Canaan,</hi> and God bade them go in and poſſeſſe it, they
were then neer unto it; but when they then refuſed <hi>Canaan, God ſware in
in his wrath that they should not enter into his reſt.</hi> If ever a people were
offered <hi>Canaan,</hi> were offered the Ordinances of God in his owne way,
certainly wee are at this time, Let us tremble leſt God (if wee reject this
<hi>mercy</hi>) ſhould ſwear in his wrath, I will have no more <hi>mercy</hi> upon you,
and ſo we prove to be a <hi>Loruhamah</hi> indeed.</p>
               <p>But a ſecond reaſon why this people could have no <hi>mercy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note> might be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of their forſaking God even in the civill State. For you are to know
that this people of Iſrael had not only left God in their Church, State, and
defiled themſelves with falſe worſhip, but they had in their civill govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
wickedly departed from that that God had appointed over them:
They had departed from the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> and rent themſelves from it.
It is true, this was of Gods permiſſion, but yet it was the wickednes of their
hearts, &amp; no excuſe at all for them. Hence <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. 4. God chargeth them
that they had ſet up Kings, but not by him. From whence this may bee
obſervable.</p>
               <p>That it is a moſt dangerous thing for a people to forſake that government
to rebell againſt that civill government that God doth ſet over them.<note place="margin">Obſer.</note>
               </p>
               <p>When the people in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. 7. had required a King, and would not be
ruled by Judges any more, ſaith the Lord to <hi>Samuel, They have not reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
you, but rejected me, that I ſhould not reigne over them:</hi> A moſt
dreadfull place, And I confeſſe freely to you, this one Text of Scripture
was the firſt Scripture that took impreſſion upon my thoughts and heart
about fearing to goe on in a way of Church-government that God had not
appointed. For thus my thoughts reaſoned; What is God ſo provoked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
a people that will reject but a Civill government, a government
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:42662:26"/>
that hee hath appointed, that ſpecially concernes but the outward man?
Then if it proves that God hath appointed any government in a Church,<note place="margin">The ground of civill &amp; Churh go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment different.</note>
that is Divine Inſtitution, that concerns the good of the ſoule, and is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
to work upon that, ſurely God will be much more provoked there
for rejecting it.</p>
               <p>And going yet further upon ſearch, finding that though we have not a
civill government appointed by God as the Jewes had, yet for the Church
ſtate, wee have one appointed even by God himſelf. And reaſon there
muſt be for it: for whatſoever hath a ſpeciall efficacy upon the heart, muſt
have a ſpirituall rule for the warrant and direction. Indeed prudence and
reaſon is enough for the ordering of things that concern the outward man,
except God will come in with his owne inſtitution. But when it cometh
to the ordering of the heart, and there is a ſpirituall efficacy expected (as in
all Church ordinances there muſt be) and that authority by which they are
executed giveth a great influence into them, now nothing can goe beyond
its principle, therefore it muſt have a divine inſtitution to give it its effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</p>
               <p>It may here be demanded, whether hat not God appointed over us a
particular civill government as he did over the Jews?</p>
               <p>That our government and all lawfull government of other Nations is
appointed by God,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> we muſt conclude is a certain truth. But not ſo appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by God as the government of the Jewes was. And the reaſon is this,
becauſe the Church and Common-wealth of the Jewes was involved in
one, and therefore the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the Church, hee ſaith they were
<hi>Aliens, and ſtrangers from the Common-wealth of Iſrael;</hi> It was meant
of the Church ſtate. There was ſuch a kind of Paedagogy under the Law,
that the Church and State were involved in one, for Chriſt would be the
head of the Church and Common-wealth too, and appoint them lawes;
And ſo their government was imediately from heaven.</p>
               <p>Now for us. That we ſhould have a government according to the rules
of wiſdome and juſtice; that indeed is appointed by God.</p>
               <p>God would have us have a government; But he leaveth the ordering of
that government to generall rules of prudence and juſtice. So that now it
is lawfull for any Kingdome or Country to agree together, and according
to the rules of wiſdom and juſtice, to appoint what government they wil, as
vvhether it ſhall be a Monarchy, or an Ariſtocracy, or a Democracy, and
to limit this according to Covenant of agreement, as whether that the
fundamentall povver ſhall be vvholly put out, or any part reſerved, hovv
farre this or that Man,<note place="margin">How farre mans au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bindes.</note> or ſociety of Men ſhall have the Managing of it,
and the like; then ſo farre as it is agreed upon, vvee are bound in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to obey either actively or paſſively, but no further are vvee bound to
obey any Man though he be in authority, yet vvee are not bound to obey
him, either actively or paſſively, conſcience is not tyed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:42662:27"/>
Though thoſe men be in authority, yet it is no reſiſting of authority at
all, not to do what they would have. Yea though the thing be lawfull they
would have, yet if it be not according to the law of the kingdom, to the firſt
agreement, I may be bound by the rules of prudence to ſave my ſelfe; but
it is not authority that binds me to obey out of conſcience: For we muſt of
neceſſity diſtinguiſh between men in authority, and the authority of thoſe
men. Wherefore ſo long as wee ſeeke but to keepe authority in the right
channell, that it flows not over the banks, we cannot be charged for reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the government God hath ſet over us, though we do not obey the wills
of thoſe who are ſet over us, and therefore there is no cauſe that we ſhould
fear, that God ſhould ſay to England upon this ground, <hi>Loruhamah,</hi> hee
will have no mercy. To proceed.</p>
               <q>But I will have mercy upon the houſe of Judah.</q>
               <p>The people of Iſrael they might ſay, <hi>Hoſea</hi> thou art a Preacher indeed,
what preach nothing but judgment, nothing but wrath, to be utterly taken
away? Is there no mercy at all? Is not God a mercifull God? Yes ſaith
the Prophet, though you be taken away, God knoweth how to glorifie his
mercy; he hath others that he can make to be objects of his mercy though
you be deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>From whence firſt you ſee that though God utterly reject ſome,<note place="margin">Obſer. 1</note> yet in
the mean time he hath others to ſhew mercy unto. Therefore it is no plea
for any ſinner to ſay thus, well, I have ſinned indeed, but God is mercifull.
What if God be mercifull? ſo he may be, though thou be damned and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
everlaſtingly. Yea, whole kingdoms &amp; nations may periſh, yet God
may be mercifull, God hath ſtil infinite ways to glorifie his mercy. Many
people in deſperate moods, lay violent hands upon themſelves, &amp; certainly
there is a kind of ſpirit of revenge in it, as if they thought there would be
ſome trouble about it, and ſo God ſhould loſe ſome honour. But if you
will have your will in this, or in any thing elſe, though you be dead and rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
and your ſouls perhaps in chains of darkneſs, God will have wayes to
be glorious in his mercy, whatſoever come of you.</p>
               <p>But 2.<note place="margin">Obſer. 2</note> 
                  <hi>I will have mercy upon the houſe of Judah.</hi> God will alwayes
have a Church, he will never deſtroy his Church at once, the Lord loveth
publique worſhip in the world: Though he will utterly <hi>take away the
houſe of Iſrael,</hi> yet he will <hi>have mercy upon the houſe of Judah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, Iſrael might ſay, what will not God be mercifull to us? why I
pray you what doth Judah get by her worſhipping of God in that which
you ſay is the only right way? Judah indeed keepeth her ſelfe to <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
keepeth her ſelfe to worſhip in the Temple, but what doth ſhe get by
it? for ought we ſee Iudah is in as hard an eſtate, and in as low a condition
as we (nay as we ſhall ſee afterward, <hi>Iudah</hi> was in a lower condition than
<hi>Iſrael,</hi>) and certainly ſuch kind of expreſſions as theſe they would be ready
to have againſt the Prophet.</p>
               <p>Well, ſaith God, let <hi>Iudah</hi> be what ſhe will, I will have mercy upon her.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:42662:27"/>
Though carnal hearts, when they look upon the low condition of the true
worſhippers of God,<note place="margin">Obſer. 3</note> think that there is no difference between thoſe that are
in a good way, and themſelves that are in the ways of ſin, yet God will
make a difference; I will have mercy upon <hi>Iudah,</hi> but not upon <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
Many carnal men pleaſe themſelves with this; I ſee others that are ſtrict,
that pray in their families, that run to Sermons, and wil not do thus and thus,
as others do, yet they are as poor, in as mean a condition as any others, what
do they get by their forwardneſs in religion? Are not we in as good a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as they? Well friend, though thy carnal heart think there is no differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
between him that ſerveth God, &amp; him that ſerveth him not, God hath
a time to manifeſt a difference; <hi>There ſhall a time come</hi> (ſaith God, Mal.
3. 18.) <hi>that you ſhall returne and diſcerne between the righteous, and the
wicked, between him that feareth God and him that feareth him not.</hi> I will
not have mercy upon <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but I will have mercy upon <hi>Iudah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, Judah had at this time many groſſe and fearful evils amongſt
them, yea ſcarcely delivered from Sodomy; it will aske a great deale of
time to ſhew you the ſtate of Judah in regard of the horrible wickedneſſe
that was in it, yet God ſaith, <hi>I will have mercy upon the houſe of Iudah.</hi>
What is the reaſon of this?</p>
               <p>Becauſe though Iudah had many groſſe evils, yet Iudah kept to the
right way of worſhipping God, kept to Ieruſalem, to the Temple; ſo
farre they kept the worſhip of God pure. Hence we ſee,</p>
               <p>God will favour a people exceeding much,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> though there be many weakneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
yea many wickedneſſes among them, if they keep the worſhip of God
pure. It is true, there are many ſpirits that are moſt bitter againſt thoſe that
ſeek to worſhip God in the right way, if they can but get them tripping in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſmall thing, they follow it againſt them with all their might, with all the
bitterneſſe that they can poſſibly. This is not like unto God, God will fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
thoſe that worſhip him in a right way, though for other reſpects hee
may have many advantages againſt them.</p>
               <p>But this (you will ſay) ſeemes to contradict what you ſaid before, for you
ſaid, the nearer any are to God, the more he hates their ſinnes, and the ſins
of thoſe that make a ſhew of worſhipping God in a pure manner, are worſe
than the ſins of others.</p>
               <p>It is true, But as their relation to God in the nearneſſe of his worſhip, is
an aggravation of their ſins, ſo their relation to God is a foundation of their
hope of mercy from God.</p>
               <p>How is this?</p>
               <p>It makes their ſin indeed worſe,<note place="margin">Object.</note> ſo as to provoke God to puniſh them ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and perhaps bitterer, yet their relation to God keepeth this ground of
faith, that God is their God ſtill, and will have mercy upon them at laſt. But
the wicked though God ſpare them longer than his own people, yet when he
cometh againſt them he rejecteth them utterly, ſo he did <hi>Iſrael: Iudah</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
was puniſhed, but yet <hi>Iudah</hi> had mercy at laſt, but (ſaith God) <hi>I will
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:42662:28"/>
have no more mercy upon the houſe of Iſrael, but will utterly take them
away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fiftly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">5.</note> Iſrael <hi>had prevailed a little before againſt</hi> Iudah; <hi>for if you read in</hi>
2 King. 14. 12. <hi>you ſhall finde that</hi> Iudah <hi>was put to the worſt before</hi> Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,
<hi>the Text ſaith,</hi> They fled every man to their Tents, and Iehoaſh the King
of Iſrael took amaziah King of Iudah, and came to Ieruſalem, and brake
down the walls of Ieruſalem, from the gates of Ephraim to the corner gate,
four hundered cubits: And he took al the gold and ſilver, and all the veſsels
that were in the houſe of the Lord, and in the treaſures of the Kings houſe,
and hoſtages, and returned to Samariah. <hi>And this was but a little before
this time,</hi> Iſrael <hi>had thus prevailed againſt</hi> Iudah, <hi>and brought</hi> Iudah <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
yet now ſaith God,</hi> I will have mercy upon Iudah <hi>but not</hi> upon Iſrael.
<hi>What ſhould we note from hence?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Obſer.</note>
               </p>
               <p>God ſometimes ſheweth mercy to poor afflicted ones, and yet rejecteth
thoſe that are greater &amp; enjoy more proſperity in the world. Many that are
poor people,<note place="margin">Poor af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted ones finde mercy when the rich are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.</note> poor ſouls that are in a low afflicted condition, God looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no
them and ſheweth mercy unto them, when brave ones that carry it out,
and thrive and live gallantly in the world, are many times rejected of God.
Mark what God ſaith, <hi>Zeph,</hi> 3. 12. I <hi>will leave in the middeſt of thee an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
and poor people, and they ſhall truſt in the name of the Lord.</hi> God
lookes not at the brave and gallant ones of the world, but at the poor and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
ones, and they ſhal truſt in the name of the Lord. We muſt not then
judge at the happineſs of men according to their ſucceſſe in the world: For
you may now be delivered, and others kept under affliction, yet afterwards
you may be rejected, and the others received unto mercy.</p>
               <p>Further,<note place="margin">6.</note> 
                  <hi>Hoſea</hi> was the Prophet of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he was ſent to the ten Tribes,
yet <hi>Hoſea</hi> tells them, whoſe Prophet eſpecially he was, and God would have
no more mercy upon them. And he ſpeaks to <hi>Judah</hi> (he was not ſent to
them) and he tells them that God would have mercy upon them.</p>
               <p>Here we may learn how impartial the Miniſters of God ought to be in
their work,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Obſer.</hi> Miniſters muſt be Impartial.</note> they muſt not goe according to their particular private engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
though they are engaged more to ſuch a people in divers regards, yet
if they be wicked, they muſt deale faithfully, and plainly, and denounce the
judgements of God: And if others, though ſtrangers to them, be godly, they
are to give to them that comfort that belongs unto them. My brethren, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality
in thoſe in publick places, eſpecially of the Miniſtery, is a great evil.</p>
               <p>It was for this that God ſaid he had made the Prieſt and the Levite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
and baſe before all the people: Why? becauſe they were partial
in the Law, <hi>Malac.</hi> 2. 9.</p>
               <p>7.<note place="margin">Obſer. 7,</note> It is a great aggravation of the miſery of ſome, that God ſheweth mercy
to others. For it is here ſet down as a part of the threatning againſt Iſrael, <hi>I
wil have no more mercy upon Iſrael, but I wil ſhew mercy to Judah.</hi> To ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate
the miſery of Iſrael, God manifeſteth his mercy to Judah. Mark
how God in <hi>Eſay.</hi> 65. 13. makes it a part of his threatning againſt the wicked,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:42662:28"/>
that he will ſhew mercy to his ſervants: <hi>Behold, my ſervants ſhall eate,
but you shall be hungry;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mercy to the saints are aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of judgement to the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.</note> 
                  <hi>my ſervants ſhall drink, but ye ſhall be thirſtie:
Behold, my ſervants ſhall rejoyce, but ye shall be aſhamed; Behold, my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
ſhall ſing for joy of heart, but yee ſhal crie for ſorrow of heart, &amp; howle
for vexation of ſpirit.</hi> Theſe [<hi>Buts</hi>] are cutting ones to the heart of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.
And obſerve it, here is the word [<hi>Behold</hi>] three times uſed, in ſetting out
the difference that God will make between his ſervants and the wicked, and
how God will aggravate the miſery of the wicked by ſhewing mercy to
people, becauſe it is a thing much to be conſidered. A like place you have,
<hi>Mat. 8. 11. Many ſhal come from the Eaſt &amp; Weſt, and shal ſit down with
Abraham, Iſaac, and Jacob, but the children of the Kingdom shal be caſt
out into utter darkneſs there shal be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</hi> Mark,
they ſhall gnaſh their teeth when they ſhal ſee how they are rejected and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
received, gnaſh their teeth for envie and vexation of ſpirit, for it is a
great aggravation of mens miſery. And is it not fulfilled this day? How do
many bite their nailes and gnaſh their very teeth to ſee the mercy that God
ſheweth to his people in giving them liberty and encouragement in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
while he caſteth ſhame &amp; contempt upon their faces, &amp; bringeth them
forth to anſwer for their wickedneſs, and to ſuffer condigne puniſhment.
Wicked mens ſpirits vex at this, it is that which they cannot poſſibly beare,
it is that which galleth and fretteth the very gaul of their heart to ſee the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of God to his people now in theſe dayes; to ſee ſuch an opportunity as
this, to meet together with this liberty to exerciſe our ſelves in the word,
when they are caged up. This they gnaſh and grind their teeth at.</p>
               <p>It is obſerveable, that which you have in <hi>Acts 22. 21. Paul</hi> was ſpeaking
there a great while to the Jews, &amp; they heard him quietly till he came to that
word <hi>Depart, for I wil ſend thee far hence unto the Gentiles;</hi> the Text ſaith,
<hi>they gave him audience unto this word and then they lift up their voices, &amp;
ſaid, Away with ſuch a fellow from the earth, for it is not fit that he should
live.</hi> What to diſgrace us thus, and to think that the Gentiles ſhould come to
have more mercie then we! Away with ſuch a fellow from the earth.</p>
               <p>We have ſuch an expreſſion likewiſe in <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 26. Our Saviour Chriſt
told the Jews of the <hi>Widow of Sarepta,</hi> that <hi>Elias</hi> the Prophet was ſent onely
to her, and that <hi>Naaman</hi> the Syrian of all the Lepers in Iſrael was cleanſed;
They of the Synagogue when they heard theſe things, the Text ſaith, <hi>They
were filled with wrath, and roſe up and thruſt him out of the Citie, and led
him to the edge of the hill whereon their Citie was built, that they might
caſt him down head-long.</hi> They were ſo vexed at Chriſts Sermon there, that
they could have broke his neck as ſoon as hee had done preaching. It was at
this word, <hi>There were many Widows in Iſrael in the time of Elias, but unto
none of them was Elias ſent ſave unto the Widow of Sarepta; &amp; many lepens
were in Iſrael in the daies of Eliſha, and none of them were clenſed, ſaving
Naaman the Syrian.</hi> The meaning is this, Chriſt intimated thus much, that
though there were many of the people of Iſrael, yet the Lord would have
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:42662:29"/>
mercy but upon a few of them; yea that God would chooſe rather other people to ſhew mercy to, then themſelves; at this they were inraged. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
this wil be the aggravation of the miſery of the damned in hell:<note place="margin">Dives ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis uritur gloria La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zari, quam suo incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dio.</note> When
a damned ſoul in hell ſhall there come to know the mercy of God to others:
It may be wicked parents ſhal ſee their children that came out of their loyns.
or out of their wombes, at the right hand of Ieſus Chriſt in glory, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
caſt down into eternal torment;<note place="margin">Chryſolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus.</note> this will be a ſtinging aggravation of
miſery, no mercy unto thee, but mercy unto thy gracious child, the child that
thou ſnibbedſt and rebukedſt for being forward, he is now at the right hand
of Chriſt &amp; thou caſt into everlaſting miſery. So it may be a poor ſervant,
a poor boy in a family, may ſtand at the right hand of Ieſus Chriſt hereafter
and aſcend with him in glory; and his rich Maſter that was, that murmured
at him, &amp; would not ſuffer him to have the leaſt time for to do God ſervice
in, but checked him in every thing, and caſt it upon his conſcience, oh this is
your preciſeneſs: perhaps he ſees himſelf caſt down into eternal miſery, when
that poor ſervant of his, that poor apprentiſe ſhall go up to eternal glory</p>
               <p>But yet further, God ſaith, <hi>I will have mercy upon the houſe of Judah.</hi>
Here is another note very obſervable, &amp; much concerning our preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
too. God promiſeth to <hi>Judah</hi> mercy, after <hi>Iſraels</hi> rejection; yet if
we ſearch the Scriptures we ſhal find that after this promiſe both before the
rejection of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was executed, and after the execution thereof; I ſay, we
ſhal finde that even <hi>Judah</hi> was under very ſore afflictions, and a ſad condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſhe was put into after this promiſe was made. As if you will turn but to
that Scripture (for we muſt look to one Scripture and compare it with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.<note place="margin">After pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of mercy, yet great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</note>
2 <hi>Chron,</hi> 28. 6. you ſhall ſee there the Text ſaith, that <hi>Pekah the Son of

never heard of ſuch a battel, ſuch a ſlaughter, wee wonder when we hear of
five or ten thouſand ſlain in the field, here we have 120000. ſlaine, and this
was after this promiſe that this ſlaughter was made: yea &amp; further, [<hi>ver.</hi> 8.]
<hi>There were beſides carried captives 200000. women, ſons, and daughters.</hi>
yea further, [<hi>ver.</hi> 17] <hi>The Edomites came and had ſmitten ſome of Iudah,
and carried away captives.</hi> And [<hi>ver.</hi> 18.] <hi>The Philiſtims had invaded the
Citties of the Low-country, and of the ſouth of Iudah, and they dwelt there:</hi>
And <hi>ver.</hi> 19.] it is ſaid, <hi>the Lord brought Iudah low,</hi> And [<hi>ver.</hi> 20.] it is ſaid
that <hi>Tilgath-Pilneſer King of Aſſyria, whom Ahas had ſent to help him, he
came &amp; diſtreſsed them, but ſtrengthened them not.</hi> Here was <hi>Pekah</hi> the ſon
of <hi>Remaliah</hi> ſlayes 120000, and carries away captive 200000. then there
comes the Philiſtims and they invaded the countrey, and then the Edomites
they carried away Captives, and God bringeth them low, and then comes
<hi>Tilgath-Pilneſer,</hi> and he inſtead of helping, diſtreſſed them. What a caſe
were they in now? yet this was after this promiſe, for this promiſe was made
to <hi>Judah</hi> in the beginning of <hi>Hoſea's</hi> Propheſie, for it is <hi>ver. 2. The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the word of the Lord by Hoſea,</hi> and it was before the rejection of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi>
for it was in the reigne of <hi>Ahas</hi> that <hi>Judah</hi> was brought into this low
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:42662:29"/>
condition, which was about 22. yeers before the execution of the ſentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> for that was fulfilled in the ſixth yeere of the reigne of <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah,</hi>
which (if you take it from the beginning of the reigne of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> who
reigned 16. yeers) make 22. yeers. Now this promiſe to <hi>Iudah</hi> (as I told
you in the beginning) was made in the dayes of <hi>Vzziah</hi> King of <hi>Iudah,</hi>
and of <hi>Jeroboham</hi> King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which was at leaſt 76. yeeres before the
rejection of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and yet after the making of this promiſe, <hi>Judah</hi> you
ſee cometh to be in this ſo ſad a condition.</p>
               <p>Yea and wee ſhall finde beſides, that preſently after <hi>Iſraels</hi> rejection,
though God had ſaid he would reject <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and be mercifull to <hi>Judah,</hi> ſo
that a man would think now that <hi>Iudah</hi> ſhould come into a better condition
than ever, yet ſee how <hi>Iudah</hi> was dealt with. And for that marke the 2.
<hi>king.</hi> 18. 13. the Text ſaith that <hi>in the thirteenth yeer of Hezekiah, Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherib
king Aſſyria came up againſt Judah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">No advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in yeelding to wicked men.</note> and this was after the caſting
off of the ten Tribes, for that was <hi>in the ſixth yeer of Hezekiah,</hi> as <hi>ver.</hi> 10.
and ſeven yeers after came <hi>Senacherib</hi> againſt Iudah, thinking to prevaile
againſt them as they had done before againſt Iſrael; and then <hi>Hezekiah</hi>
was faine to give him <hi>all the ſilver that was found in the houſe of the Lord,
and in the treaſures of the Kings houſe;</hi> Yea the Text ſaith, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. that <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi>
was faine <hi>to cut off all the gold from the doores of the Temple of the
Lord, &amp; from the pillars, and to give it to the King of Aſſyria.</hi> Now the
Lord keepe our Kingdom, our Parliament from giving the gold of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
doores in any way of compliance with any malignant party; that have
any evil eye at the beauty of our Sion.</p>
               <p>Yea after <hi>Senacherib</hi> had gotten this, not content with it, he ſendeth <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhekah</hi>
from Lachiſh, with a great hoſt againſt Ieruſalem. You may ſee,
the adverſaries of the Church are never ſatisfied, yeeld to them, gratifie
them, in what you will, this is the firſt temptation: what will you be ſo ſtrict,
and rugged, and yeeld to them in nothing? but if they prevaile with you, to
begin to yeeld, they will never have done, they will ſtill encroach upon you,
<hi>Hezekiah</hi> yeelded to <hi>Senacherib,</hi> even to take away the gold of the Temple
doores, yea a little while after he cometh againe with a great hoſt, ſo that
<hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſaid, it was a day of trouble and rebuke, <hi>Chap.</hi> 19. Nothing will
quiet them but the ruine of the Church, they muſt needs have that, <hi>Downe
with it, downe with it, even to the ground,</hi> nothing elſe will ſatisfie them.</p>
               <p>To this low eſtate and ſad condition was Iudah brought not long after
Iſrael was taken away, and yet God promiſeth mercy to Iudah for all this.</p>
               <p>VVhat ſhall we learne from this?</p>
               <p>This profitable leſſon for our preſent condition,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> God may intend much
mercy, yea God may be in a way of mercy to a people, yet may bring that
people into very great ſtraits &amp; difficulties. The promiſes of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
are alwayes to be underſtood with condition of the croſſe. If we thinke
that upon the promiſe of mercy we ſhall be delivered from all trouble &amp; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,

have come mercy, we looked for light, and behold darkneſs, now the heart

done great things for us, yet how ready are wee though God be in ſuch a

any combining of the adverſaries together? we muſt expect nothing now

was contemporary with <hi>Hoſea</hi> &amp; it was not much after the making of this
promiſe) wee ſhall ſee how they were troubled with fear; ſaith the Text,
<hi>When it was told the houſe of David, ſaying, Syria is confederate with Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im,
the heart of the King of Judah, and the heart of his people were moved
as the trees of the wood were moved with the winde,</hi> they were afraid and
ſhook as the very leaves of the tree ſhake, both the king of Judah and all the
people, Well, but God ſpeaks to the Prophet, in the 8. <hi>Chap, ver.</hi> 11. (and it
was at this time when they were ſo troubled becauſe of the enemies coming
againſt them) God I ſay in that Chapter ſpeaks to the Prophet, &amp; (ſaith the
text) <hi>he ſpeakes with a ſtrong hand, ſaying, ſay not ye, a Confederacy, a confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy:
Oh the King of Iſrael &amp; the king of Syria are confederate together,
what shal we do? we are undone, we are loſt for ever; ſay not ye, A confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy,
neither fear ye this fear, nor be afraid, but ſanctifie the Lord of hoſts
himſelf, and let him be your fear.</hi> Thus God would have his Saints do, not
when you hear of confederate enemies, or any ill tidings abroad; Oh the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts

be your fear, and let him be your dread, &amp; he ſhal be for a ſanctuary to you:
and mark the reſolution of the Prophet afterward, <hi>ver. 17. I will wait upon
the Lord that hideth his face from the houſe of Jacob, and I will looke for
him.</hi> Oh that this were the diſpoſition of our hearts! Take that note away

               <q>I will not have mercy upon Iſrael, but I will have mercy upon Judah,

               <p>I will ſave them by the Lord.</p>
               <p>VVhat is the meaning of this?</p>
               <p>This by Interpreters is carried concerning <hi>Chriſt:</hi> That God the Father

                  <hi>viz.</hi> That the administration of
Gods grace to his people is given into the hands of JESUS CHRIST. It is
Chriſt that doth ſave the people of God, and hath ſaved them in all former
times, in all ages. It is true, in the merits of Chriſt all are ſaved; that every
one will grant, as <hi>Zach. 9. 11. By the blood of thy Covenant I have ſent
forth thy priſoners out of the pit.</hi> All the priſoners of Gods people ever ſince
the world began, that have been ſent out of the pit, it hath been by the blood
of the covenant, by the merits of Chriſt: and not onely ſo, but Chriſt in the
adminiſtration of all hath been the chiefe, he hath been the Angel of Gods
preſence, that hath ſtood up for his people in all their neceſſities, he hath been
the great Captain &amp; deliverer, the Saviour of them all. Let Chriſt then have
the honour of a Soveraigne to us in regard of our ſalvation in outward deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances.
Let us look up to him then for ſalvation in all our ſtraits. And if
Chriſt was the Saviour of his people in all ages, and ſtill will be, then ſurely
thoſe ages and places where Chriſt is moſt known and honoured may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect

that ever was ſince the world began, Chriſt is most known and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in this age, and of all places in the world, here in <hi>England</hi> and amongſt

               <p>This could not but ſting Iſrael, that Judah ſhould be thought to have

               <p>It is a ſtinging thing to carnal hearts,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> and much bitterneſſe of ſpirit it

<hi>Oh he truſted in God,</hi> he thinketh he hath more intereſt in God then others,
<hi>now let his God come and ſave him.</hi> I remember in the book of Martyrs
we read that the Papiſts were much vexed againſt the proteſtants, becauſe
they uſed to ſay, <hi>our God</hi> and <hi>our Lord,</hi> they were knowne by this ſpeech,
and the Papiſts were inraged againſt them for this, becauſe they ſeemed to
claime more intereſt in God then others. And indeed what is the cauſe of
the quarrel in the World againſt Gods people, but becauſe they thinke they
claime more peculiarity and intereſt in God than others? and this is the
reaſon that ſoule-ſearching preaching cannot be endured, becauſe it makes
a difference between the one and the other, and ſhewes that ſome have an
intereſt in God more than others. Hence it is that in no places in the world
mens ſpirits ſo fret againſt preaching as in <hi>England,</hi> why? becauſe there is
not ſuch ſoul-examining, ſuch ſoule-diſtinguiſhing preaching in the World
as in <hi>England.</hi> Yea that is the reaſon of the bitterneſſe of one profeſſor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
another, becauſe one is a Proteſtant at large, and the other manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
more power of godlineſſe, is more ſtrict in his courſe; and ſeemes to
claime a greater ſhare in God than the former. Profesſion in <hi>England</hi> is a

               <q>I will ſave them by the Lord their God.</q>
               <p>God is the God of <hi>Judah</hi> ſtill,<note place="margin">Obſerv.</note> therefore God will ſave them.</p>
               <p>So long as God is our God we need not fear our adverſaries. Yee have

               <p>It ſhall not be by any outward meanes, but by the immediate hand of
God. This promiſe that God would ſave them not by bow nor by ſword,
&amp;c. it was performed two ſeveral times, and there is a third time for the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
of it which is yet to come.</p>
               <p>It was done firſt when the Angel of the Lord went out and <hi>ſmote in one

them <hi>without bow,</hi> for they had no need to uſe the bow then, becauſe
the Angel of the Lord deſtroyed them.</p>
               <p>The ſecond time was when he ſaved Judah in their <hi>returne from captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
then as it is <hi>Zach.</hi> 4. 6, he ſaved them not <hi>by might nor by power, but by
my ſpirit, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> Marke the phraſe, as if God ſhould ſay,
I have ſtrength, for I am the Lord of hoſts, I can command Armies, if I
would, to ſave you; No, though I be the Lord of hoſts, yet I will not ſave
you by might nor by power, but by my ſpirit. Therefore <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43. 7. their

               <p>Then the third time, which is yet to come, that is, in the wonderful work

Deliverance of a people without bow, and without ſword is a great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy:
For ſuch are the wofull miſeries that a people doe ſuffer when warre
commeth, that uſually the victory will ſcarce pay the charges of the battel:
though we be ſure to be ſaved at laſt, yet if we muſt be <hi>ſaved by bow,</hi> and <hi>by
ſword,</hi> I ſay the miſery that we may ſuffer in our ſalvation, may be more
then the ſalvation. It was the height of that mercy promiſed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9. 5. that it
ſhould be <hi>without confuſed noiſe and garments rolled in blood.</hi> Such a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
we have had; and had Chriſt come to have raigned amongſt us, though
he had come with his garments rolled in blood, we ſhould willingly have
entetrayned him; If he had come ryding upon his <hi>red horſe;</hi> But behold
he comes ryding upon his <hi>white horſe,</hi> in peace and mercy all this while, and
the mercies we have had, have been very cheap, they have not been by bow,
nor by ſword. And if God ſhould come at length by the ſword, and bring
perfect ſalvation to us by blood, which God forbid; but if he ſhould, we
have had already more mercy without blood, than our bloods are worth;
ſhould we now have our bloods ſhed, God hath paied us beforehand: who
almoſt in this congregation, but two or three yeers agoe would have loſt his
blood to procure ſo much mercy to England, as England hath had already?</p>
               <p>Further.<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> Such is the love of God to his people, that he is pleaſed to worke
for them beyond meanes. The other point was, that he can ſave his people
without means; This, that he will do it beyond means: For the grace, and
love of God to his people, is ſo high, &amp; glorious, that it is beyond that which
can be conveyed by means, therefore it muſt be done more imediatly. <hi>Exod.</hi>

God must borne imediately and ſave them by himſelfe.</p>
               <p>But laſtly,<note place="margin">4.</note> the more imediate the hand of God appeareth in his mercy to
his people, the more ſweet and precious ought that mercy to be then (this
were an excellent argument to follow to the full, and ſo neerly concerning
us; you ſee the ſcriptures were made for other times, then for the times in
which they were firſt revealed) a moſt excellent place of Scripture you have
for this <hi>Pſal. 21. 13. Be thou exalted O Lord in thine own ſtrength, ſo will
we ſing, and praiſe thy power.</hi> When God cometh in his own ſtrength, and
not in the ſtrength of the creature, and by meanes, then do the Saints ſing
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:42662:33"/>
and praiſe the power of God. <hi>Dulcious ex ipſo fonte,</hi> wee uſe to ſay, that
which cometh imediately cometh exceeding ſweetly: Then the Saints may
boaſt in God, when God cometh immediately with his ſalvation, ſo you
have it, <hi>Pſal. 44. 7. 8. Thou haſt ſaved us from our enemies, and haſt put
them to ſhame that hated us:</hi> What followeth? <hi>in God will we boaſt all the
day long, and praiſe thy name for ever.</hi> So that the Saints of God then praiſe
God, nay they may lawfully give up themſelves to boaſt, when God works
imediately. When God works by means, then they muſt take heed of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribing
to the means, but when God cometh imediately, then they may
boaſt.</p>
               <p>It is the bleſſedneſſe of Heaven, that Gods mercy cometh imediately:
created mercies are the moſt perfect mercies. Suppoſe God had bin with
them by bow, and by ſword, when <hi>Senacherib</hi> came againſt them, could
they have been ſaved as they were? Gods <hi>hooke</hi> that he put <hi>in his noſe,</hi> and
<hi>bridle</hi> that he put <hi>in his lipps</hi> (for ſo God ſaith he would doe with him, uſe
him as a beaſt) were better then their ſword or bow.</p>
               <p>Surely, if ever any nation knew what it was to have imediate mercies
come down from heaven, England doth: If ever Nation ſaw God exalting
himſelfe in his own power, England hath: we have lived (and bleſſed be
God we have lived) to ſee the Lord exalting himſelfe in his own power: Oh
let us cry out with the Pſalmiſt (and with that I ſhall end) <hi>Be thou exalted
O Lord in thy own ſtrength amongſt us, ſo will we</hi> ſtill, and ſtill, and ſtill,

               <p>We doe not reade of the firſt child <hi>Jezreel</hi> that it was wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
but the ſecond childe <hi>Loruhamah</hi> that was weaned,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:42662:33"/>
before the third child <hi>Loammi</hi> was conceived.<note place="margin">Lect. 4.</note> What is the meaning of this?</p>
               <p>There is much of Gods minde ſhewed unto us even in this very thing
that we ordinarily let ſlip and paſſe over.</p>
               <p>The reaſon is, becauſe this ſecond childe <hi>Loruhamah</hi> was to ſignifie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the people of Iſrael their carrying out of their own Countrey into capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
into Aſſyria: It was to ſignifie to them that they ſhould be weaned from
the comforts and delights that there were in their owne Countrey; they
ſhould be taken away from their milke and honey that they had there; and
be carryed into Aſſyria, and be there fed with hard meate, even with the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of affliction and the bread of affliction. The firſt childe did but ſignifie
their ſcattering, eſpecially in regard of their ſeditions amongſt themſelves.
But the ſecond childe ſignified the carrying away all of them wholly into
captivity from their own Land,<note place="margin">Vatician<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur hic dura ut deſti. u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antur ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo Dei pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetiis &amp; gratiis. Vatab. in loc.</note> Therefore the ſecond childe is weaned, <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis
ſuſtent abitur immundis,</hi> So. <hi>Jerome</hi> hath it, They ſhould be carried
amongſt the Gentiles, and be fed with unclean meat, they ſhould be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of propheſie, and of the milke of the word, and of the ordinances that
they enjoyed, So <hi>Vatablus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ordinances are as the breaſts of conſolation, out of which the people of
God ſuck ſoul-ſatisfying comforts. So you have it, <hi>Eſay, 66. 11. That you
may ſuck and be ſatisfied with the breaſts of her conſolations,</hi> that you may
milke out and be delighted with the aboundance of her glory. And <hi>Cant.</hi>
1. 4. <hi>We will remember thy loves more than wine:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Memares uberum tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orum super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinum.</note> The old latine hath it,
Wee will remember thy dugs above wine; and ſo the words will beare.
Theſe people ſhould be deprived of thoſe dugs and breaſts out of which
they had ſucked much ſweetneſſe before, even deprived of all comfort in
God. Gods people hang upon God, and ſuck comfort from him, even as
the infant upon the mothers breſt, and ſucks ſweetneſſe, and comfort, and
nouriſhment from thence.</p>
               <p>This expreſſion then of weaning the childe, implies theſe two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> That the enjoyment of the comforts of a ſweet native ſoile, ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
where there are any ordinances together with it, is a very great bleſſing
of God;<note place="margin">The ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the comfort<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of a native ſoile.</note> and the being deprived of it is a great affliction, yea to ſome it
comes as a curſe. The very ſucking of the ayr of a ſweet native ſoile (and
eſpecially ſuch a comfortable ſoile as we have here in <hi>England</hi>) is certainly
a great bleſſing from the Lord. Thoſe that have been deprived of it, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed away, have been more ſenſible of it than any of you who alwayes
have enjoyed it. Many have laine ſucking at the ſweetneſſe of this our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh ayr, and at the comforts that there have been in their accommodations,
ſo long, till they have ſucked in that which (if Gods mercy had not preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) would have proved to have been poyſon to them to have baned their
ſoules. But I ſpeak not of all, I make no queſtion but there have beene ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of Gods dear ſervants that have tarried in their native ſoile, and kept the
uprightneſſe of their hearts and conſciences as cleare as others that went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. It is true, the comforts of a native ſoile are ſweet, but except we may
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:42662:34"/>
enjoy them with the breaſts of theſe conſolations (or Ordinances of the
Church) they are notable to ſatisfie the ſoul: yea, except we may ſuck out
ſuch milke of theſe breaſts as is ſincere milke, and not ſoiled nor ſowred by
the inventions of men, better a great deale that we were weaned from all the
ſweetneſſe and accommodation we have in our native ſoile by the mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of our affections to them, then that God ſhould weane us from them,
by ſending of us into captivity, or by giving the adverſary power over us,
or by making the Land too hot for us. But that for the firſt.</p>
               <p>Again,<note place="margin">2.</note> in that this childe was weaned, and by the weaning was to ſignify
their being carried away out of their own into a ſtrange Countrey; this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
implies thus much. That it is an evil thing for a childe to be taken
from the mothers breſt too ſoone, and ſent away to be nurſed by others. The
expresſion doth fully imply this, for it is to tell us the evill condition of the
people, that they ſhould be taken from their own, and ſent to another Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey:
This their affliction is ſet out by a childes being taken from its owne
mothers breſt; it could not expreſſe what it intended, except it were to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
thus much unto us, that it is an evil thing for a childe to be taken from
its own mothers breſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>It is unnatural then for mothers out of daintineſſe, and curioſity to deny
the fruit of their wombes,<note place="margin">Mothers muſt nurſe their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> the comfort of their breaſts. It is true, in time of
weakneſſe and danger, when it may be dangerous to themſelves and the
childe, God permits it. But when it is meerly (I ſay) out of daintineſſe, and
curioſity, certainly it is an evil that is againſt nature it ſelf. <hi>Hannahs</hi> care of
her ſonne <hi>Samuel,</hi> is recorded by this, &amp; it is mentioned by the holy Ghoſt,
in her commendation, that ſhe gave him ſuck. 1 <hi>Sam. 1. 23, The woman a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode
and gave her ſonne ſuck untill ſhe weaned him,</hi> ſaith the Text. It is ſaid
of the Oſtrich, <hi>Iob. 39. 16. That ſhe is hardned againſt her young ones as
though they were not hers;</hi> and this Oſtrich is reckoned among the fowles
that are unclean: And <hi>Lam. 4. 3. Even the ſea-monſters draw out their
breaſts, they give ſuck to their young ones, yet the daughter of my people is
become cruel, like the Oſtridges in the wilderneſſe,</hi> more cruel then the very
ſea-monſters themſelves, that draw out their breaſts and give ſuck to their
young ones.</p>

And there is much to be known in this.</p>
               <p>Why doth God ſtay?</p>
               <p>This is to ſhew the great patience of God toward his people:<note place="margin">Queſt. Anſ.</note> For God
was now about to reject his people utterly, from being his people, God was

weaned, I have read of the Jewes, that their manner was to be a long time,
three yeeres ſometimes, before they weaned their children. God then it
ſeemes ſtayed long here, before he would have the third childe, (that is <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ammi</hi>) born, before he would come with that dreadful ſentence, <hi>you are
not my people, and I will not be your God.</hi> Firſt when <hi>Jezreel</hi> was born, then
they are ſcattered up and down, yea but they are not all carried away captive
yet: Then <hi>Lo-ruhamah</hi> is born, and then they are gone, carried away
captive, never to return again. But for all this, God may yet own them in
their captivity; This is not ſo bad as for God to ſay I will have no more to
do with you as my people; Lord though we be under affliction, under the
power of our enemies, own us ſtill, acknowledge us to be thine, though we
be in the fiery furnace, yet let us have thee to be our God, <hi>No</hi> (ſaith God)
<hi>you shall not onely be ſcattered, but you shall be all carried away captive,
and I will not own you neither, I will caſt you off, you shall not be my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
neither will I be your God.</hi> Now before this God makes a ſtop.</p>
               <p>Hence obſerve firſt.</p>
               <p>That God ſtops in his anger for a while as long as he pleaſeth.<note place="margin">Obſ. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>
                  </note> God is
called, <hi>Nah. 1. 2. The Lord of anger,</hi> ſo are the words, though tranſlated
otherwiſe. We may apply it at leaſt thus, God is the Lord of his own anger,
he can let it out as far as he will, he canſtop it when he will, he can command
it to come in when he pleaſeth.</p>
               <p>It is not ſo with us; our anger, our pasſions are Lords over us; if we once
let our anger our pasſions ariſe, we cannot get them down againe when we
would, we cannot ſtill them when we pleaſe; if we let our affections run,
we cannot call them in when we will, but are ſometimes ſlaves to our own
pasſions,<note place="margin">Power over pasſions.</note> and they lord it over us.</p>
               <p>This is that frame of ſpirit that we ſhould all labour for, to be like to God,
though angry, yet ſin not, ſo as we can ſtop when we will, and command our
anger as we pleaſe. As it is ſaid of God, that he ſayes to the proud waves, <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
ſhalt thou go &amp; no further:</hi> Oh that we were able to ſay to thoſe proud
waves of our pasſions,<note place="margin">Hoſ. 11. 8.</note> Hitherto are you gone, but you ſhall goe no further!</p>
               <p>Againe,<note place="margin">Churches not too ſuddenly to be rejected.</note> mark here, God ſtoppeth in his anger for a while. When this
dreadful judgement was come to be executed, God is even ready to ſay (as
he ſaith afterward in this Propheſie) <hi>How shall I give thee up? Oh Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im? How shall I deliver thee, O Iſrael?</hi> Teaching us thus much,</p>
               <p>That thoſe that have been once the people of God muſt not be ſuddenly
rejected from being Gods people: but when we are about any ſuch thing,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:42662:35"/>
either to reject any particular man or woman (who have made profeſsion
of Religion) from being Gods, or to reject a Church from being Gods;
we had need make a ſtop, we had need pauſe, we had need examine the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
very well; yea and when we have examined, and are ready to doe it, to
make a ſtop againe, and to bethink our ſelves what we doe. We muſt not
be too ſudden in rejecting thoſe that have been once the people of God.
from being the people of God now: It is Gods way you ſee here.</p>
               <p>Many men are too haſty in this point, in rejecting both particular ſervants
of God, and particular Churches from belonging to God, aſſoone as they
ſee ſome few things amiſſe in them, eſpecially if there be any thing groſſe,
preſently they are no Churches at all, they are altogether Antichriſtian, they
belong to <hi>the Beaſt;</hi> and ſo while they ſtrike at the Beaſt, they wound the
<hi>Lamb.</hi> Certainly there is to be acknowledged much of Chriſt, not onely
in particular Saints, but in regard of the Church Ordinances of many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
congregations in England: we muſt take heed therefore of too ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
rejection of them from belonging to God, to be his people in that way
of Church fellowſhip.</p>
               <p>We come now to the conception of the third childe. It was a ſonne, and
his name was <hi>Lo-ammi.</hi> The ſecond childe a daughter, but the third a Son:
What is the meaning of this? I told you (the laſt day) that by the ſecond
childe was noted the ſtate of the people at that time, that it grew weaker and
more effeminate: weaker in regard of their outward ſtrength, and more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminate
in regard of their ſpirits: And that I made good to you out of the
Hiſtory of thoſe times in the book of the Kings. Well, but now it is a ſon,
what doe they grow ſtronger then before, now they are come neerer to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
then before? Yes, though neerer to ruine and deſtruction, and
more heavy wrath then they were before, yet they get up a little ſtrength be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that time: Therefore the third childe is a ſonne. Concerning the
ſtrength that this people had got at this time, a little before this their utter
rejection, upon which their ſpirits were raiſed, you ſhall finde the Hiſtory
of it in 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17. 4. where you have a declaration of the ſtate of the ten
Tribes then when <hi>Lo-ammi</hi> was borne; for the Text tells us, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
<hi>to joyne in confederacy with the King of Egypt;</hi> and ſo whereas former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they had done homage by preſents to the King of Aſſyria, now being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate
with the King of Egypt, they refuſed to bring any more preſents to
him; they begin now to be a jolly people, and hoped to caſt off that yoke
of bondage under which they were in regard of the Aſſyrians.</p>
               <p>God ſometimes letteth men,<note place="margin">Obſerv.</note> and Nations, and Churches to riſe a little
out of their affliction, before their utter ruine: he gives them a little reviv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
they have a little lightning before their death. Many men think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in a very good condition, if having been in affliction, their afflictions
doe begin once to abate, and they begin to get a little up; now they think
they are ſafe, and they are ready to ſay with <hi>Agag, Surely the bitterneſſe of
death is gone,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 15. 32.</note> ſurely the worſt is paſt. But you may ſometimes be recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:42662:35"/>
when God intendeth you ſhould be ſuddenly rejected. Many may be
preſerved from ſome judgements, becauſe they are reſerved to greater judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
The Lord hath begun indeed to give us in England a little reviving,
a little ſtrength to enable us to riſe againſt the oppresſions of our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
thoſe cruel oppresſions. But let us not be ſecure, notwithſtanding this;
for though we have ſome little reviving, if we follow not God on in the way
of humiliation and reformation, this our little reviving may be but a light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
before our death.</p>
               <p>And yet further, it is very obſervable, when the condition of Iſrael was at
this time when God was about to ſay, <hi>Lo-ammi, they are not my people;</hi>
what it was not only in regard of their ſtrength, but what it was in regard of
their ſins. For you ſhall finde (if you examine the Hiſtory) that the people of
Iſrael were at this time ſomewhat better then they had been before: not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
had gotten ſomwhat more ſtrength, but they were ſomewhat better in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of their ſins then they had been; Imeane they had leſſe ſins then they
had before: yet now God is ſaying to them, <hi>Lo-ammi, You are not my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>
And for that obſerve, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17. 2. if you reade that Chap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>, you ſhall
finde that the very time of the utter rejection of Iſrael was in the dayes of
<hi>Hoſhea,</hi> and the Text ſaith, <hi>He did evil in the ſight of the Lord;</hi> the King in
whoſe dayes they were ſo rejected, did evil in the ſight of the Lord, <hi>but not
as the Kings of Iſrael that were before him.</hi> He was not ſo bad as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Kings of Iſrael, and yet in his dayes there comes utter deſtruction upon
Iſrael. Yea and as the King was not ſo bad then as others before him; ſo it
may ſeeme the people were not ſo bad as in former time, for <hi>ver.</hi> 9. the Text
ſaith, <hi>That the children of Iſrael did ſecretly thoſe things that were not
right, againſt the Lord their God.</hi> Indeed they were ſinful, but their ſinfulnes
was <hi>ſecret,</hi> they did not ſin with ſuch an open impudent face, as it ſeemed,
as heretofore. Yet in this Kings time, and when theſe people were thus,
commeth their utter ruine.</p>
               <p>What may we learne from hence?</p>
               <p>This, That ſometimes when there are greater ſinnes, patience ſtayes
judgement;<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> and yet afterward when a people ſeeme to be in a better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
not onely in regard of their outward ſtrength,<note place="margin">When ſins ſeem to be leſs then be fore, yet then judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may come.</note> but then in regard of
their ſins too, yet then God cometh with his wrath upon that people.</p>
               <p>Let us not flatter our ſelves, although we can ſay that ſome things here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us are not ſo bad as heretofore they have beene. Suppoſe there be
ſome partial reformation, this is not ground enough to ſecure us. We cannot
reaſon thus, Why heretofore the Land was more ſinful then now; and the
Governours were more oppresſing then now, there hath been (thanks be to
God) much reformation. This is not enough, we may be neerer the foreſt
miſery at this time (if our reformation be not a through reformation) then
we were before. And the reaſon is this becauſe God when he comes againſt
a Nation, he doth not onely come againſt it for the preſent ſins that they are

reckon with them for ſins that were along time ago committed, &amp; for their

perhaps they have been drunkards, unclean, wicked, 20. yeers agone, God

make way for our ruine, and then at length ſome leſſer ſinnes may do it.</p>
               <p>You that have been guilty of groſſe ſins, take heed of ſmall ſins; for though
God hath pared you when you were guilty of great ſins, do not ſay that he
will ſpare you now you commit leſſer ſins; but at this time of committing

the eſtate of a Chriſtian in communion with Chriſt by grace,<note place="margin">A Church ſtate may be loſt, but not the fouls com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Chriſt</note> and a Church
eſtate. Men and women may looſe their Church eſtate, and that for ever;
but their eſtate in communion with Jeſus Chriſt by grace, they can never
loſe that: And this is a great difference, and affordeth abundance of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.
True, our Church ſtate (I mean in regard of an inſtituted Church in
Congregations) it is a great priviledge, a great mercy; but our Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with Jeſus Chriſt is a higher priviledge, and that priviledge gan never

               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> yet it is a moſt heavy judgemen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the people of God, now to be unpeopled, for God to be no more theirs,
and for them to be no more the Lords. A heavy judgement for the Lord to
ſay, Well, I will be no more a God to you whatſoever I am to others, no
more yours in my goodneſſe, in my mercy, in my power, or whatſoever I
am in my ſelfe.</p>
               <p>The being caſt off from God.</p>
               <p>Firſt takes us off from that high honour that was before upon a people;
for ſo in <hi>Eſay, 4. 4. Since thou waſt precious in my ſight, thou hoſt beene
honourable,</hi> The people of God gathered together in Church Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, certainly are in an honourable condition; when they are dispeopled,
they are caſt off from this their priviledge, from their honour.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2.</note> They have not the preſence of God with them as before, not
the care of God towards them, nor the protection of God over them, not
the delight of God in them, nor the communication of God to them. What
ſhould I ſpeake of all theſe particulars?<note place="margin">The great argument to pleade with God by, is our relation to him.</note> But among other priviledges they

this relation, which was the uſuall way of the Prophets to pleade with
God, <hi>becauſe they were the people of God.</hi> So <hi>Eſay, 64. 9. Be not wroth very

Againe, <hi>Jer. 14. 9. Why doeſt thou ſtand as a man aſtoniſhed amongſt us,
as a mighty man that cannot ſave? Yet thou O Lord art in the middeſt of
us, and we are called by thy name, leave us not.</hi> This Text is ours this day,
and well may we ſay, <hi>O Lord why doeſt thou ſtand as a man aſtoniſhed?</hi> Oh
yet if we can but take up the ſecond part, and ſay, <hi>We are called by thy name,</hi>
we may make more comfortable uſe of the former, <hi>Why doeſt thou ſtand as
a man aſtoniſhed?</hi> How doth a man aſtoniſhed ſtand? He ſtands ſtill in a
place, as if he knew not which way to goe, he is in a kinde of deſtraction.
firſt he goes one way, and by and by he returns again. The Lord, we know,
knoweth his purpoſe from eternity, but the Scriptures are pleaſed to expreſſe
Gods wayes towards us in the ſimilitude. Hath not God ſtood amongſt us
as a man aſtoniſhed? God hath beene in a way of mercy, and then ſtood
ſtill, and then gone forward a little, and afterward gone back again; and yet
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:42662:37"/>
back and back ſtill, and we have prayed and cryed, and God hath ſtood as a
man aſtoniſhed, as if he were not yet reſolved which way to goe. Let us
pray earneſtly to God that he would not ſtand as a man aſtoniſhed, but that
the way of the Lords mercy may be made cleare before him, and cleare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us. But this I bring in to ſhew that the relation that people have to
God, is the ground of their encouragement to pray to God, and when a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
is rejected they loſe this priviledge.</p>
               <p>Our relations to God are very ſweet things, though ordinarily they are

               <p>VVe firſt begin with God in our apoſtacy,<note place="margin">Obſerv.</note> before God begins with us in
his rejection; I would not have withdrawn my ſelf from being your God,

loveth, he begins firſt; we love not him, but he loveth us firſt: But when it
comes to departing, it then begins on our ſide, wee firſt depart before the
Lord doth: and this is that which will be a dreadful aggravation to wicked
men another day to think with themſelves. This evil is come upon us, God

               <p>It is a greater miſery to loſe God himſelf,<note place="margin">Obſerv.</note> then to be deprived of whatſoever

hypocrite, and a true gracious heart; an hypocrite is ſatisfied with what
cometh from God, but a true gracious heart is ſatisfied with nothing but
God himſelfe: though God lets out never ſo many fruits of his bounty and

for the perſon of her lover, as for his giſts, for what ſhe hath by him: but the

in <hi>Pſal. 51. 9. Turne away thy angry face from my ſins.</hi> It ſeemes Gods face

from this face of God: Oh no, rather let God be preſent with a gracious
heart, though he be angry; though his anger continue, yet let me have his
countenance. This is plainly gathered hence, in that God ſaith not, <hi>I will
not give you theſe and theſe favours,</hi> but <hi>I will not be your God,</hi> that this
is the ſoreſt threatning that poſſibly can be to a gracious heart.</p>
               <p>5. This is the judgement for ſin,<note place="margin">5. Obſer.</note> Gods not being their God. It hence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
that ſin carryes along with it in it ſelfe its own puniſhment. How is
that? Thus, By ſin we refuſe to have God to be our God; by it we depart
from God, we do not truſt God, nor love him, nor fear him. The very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of ſin hath this in it, that it cauſeth a ſinner to depart from God, yea to
reject God from being a God unto him, and this is the puniſhment, <hi>I will
not be your God.</hi> And this is the ſoreſt puniſhment to a ſinner, that he ſhall
not for ever have God to his God.</p>

he be never ſo wicked a man. But for any inward intimate familiarity with
thoſe, not thus joyned in ſuch Relations, ought not to be; if they reject God,
if they will not be Gods, they ſhould not be ours. It is ſaid <hi>Iob.</hi> 8, 20. That

               </p>
               <p>That which remaineth in the Chapter, it is a promiſe of mercy, both to
Iſrael, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. and afterwards to Iſrael and Judah together, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. To
Iſrael firſt, and that is,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yet the number of the children of Iſrael ſhall be as the ſand of the Sea,

gracious promiſes of mercy to Iſrael in future generations, though
for the preſent God had determined what to do with this Iſrael.</p>
               <p>Here then we have firſt a promiſe of mercy to Iſrael, in the middeſt of the
ſoreſt judgement that God threatneth, he comes in with promiſes of mercy
even unto Iſrael. And Secondly, this mercy to be in future generations.
And thirdly, to conſiſt in the multitudes that ſhould be gathered to Iſrael.</p>
               <p>Theſe three things are obſervable in general.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That there is ſuch a gracious promiſe immediately after ſuch a ſore
and dreadful threatning as this, as indeed it is one of the moſt dreadful threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
we have in all the Book of God; yet here in the cloſe of the Chapter,
we have as gracious a promiſe again as is in the whole Book of God. From
whence we may obſerve thus much.</p>
               <p>That the Lord in Judgement remembreth Mercy.<note place="margin">Obſerv.</note> It is a ſore thing when
God in mercy ſhall remember judgement, but it is as comfortable when
God in judgement remembers mercy. When God threatneth moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
yet he promiſeth moſt graciouſly. Wee ſhould therefore when we
moſt feare the threats of God, yet looke up to the promiſes of God, looke
up to ſee when wrath is denounced in the moſt hideous and dreadfull way,
whether we cannot spie a Promiſe,<note place="margin">It is uſuall in proſpe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

though but as big as a mans hand, whether there be not yet a little crevis
through which we may ſee whether God doth not break forth with a little
light in a way of promiſe.</p>
               <p>It is a uſual thing when we are in proſperity to forget all threatnings, and
fo it is as uſual when we are in adverſity to forget all promiſes. When wee
hear of mercy to Gods people, we are taken up and never thinke of Gods
wrath; and on the other ſide when we heare of his wrath on unbeleeving
hearts are taken up as wel, and never think of his grace and mercy. We ought
to ſanctifie the name of God in both: when God is in away of juſtice, look
up to his grace; and when he is in a way of grace, look upon his juſtice, and
ſanctifie that name of his likewiſe. And for that end, I ſhall give you two
notable Texts of Scripture; there are many of this kinde, but two I ſhall
give you, that are as famous as any I know in the book of God: the one that
declareth to you that when God expreſſeth the greateſt mercy, yet then hee
doth expreſſe greateſt wrath; and the other when God expreſſeth greateſt
wrath he then expreſſeth greateſt mercy: And I ſhall ſhew you the name of
God oughto be ſanctified in both.</p>

ſcarce know the difference betweene their foes and their friends: Many
when they go abroad if any diſpleaſe them, they come home and are angry
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:42662:39"/>
with their wives, with their ſervants, with their children, with their friends,
with every one about them, they know not then who is a friend and who is
not when they are in their pasſion, their wives, and children, and ſervants
wonder what the matter is with them. Sure ſome body or other hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed
my maſter abroad to day he is ſo touchie, ſo angry upon every little
thing. My brethren, It is a diſhonour to you in the eyes of your ſervants, and
it layes low your authority in your families, for them to ſee you come home
in ſuch a per that you know not how to be pleaſed, though they have done
nothing to diſpleaſe you.</p>
               <p>God doth not ſo, though he be never ſo angry, yet hee knowes thoſe that
truſt in him. Let Gods anger be never ſo publick, and general abroad in the
world, if there be but a poor ſoul in the world that lies in a poor cottage, in
a hole, that is gracious, the Lord knowes it, and takes notice of it, and that
ſoul ſhal know too that God doth know it. It is true, when the wrath of God
is revealed abroad in the world, &amp; ſeemes as if it would ſwallow up all thoſe
of the Saints, whoſe ſpirits are weake and fearfull, they are then afraid of
Gods wrath, that they ſhall be ſwallowed up in the common calamity: be
of good comfort, God knowes thoſe that truſt in him, even when his wrath
is never ſo dreadful and general abroad in the world.</p>
               <p>It is in this caſe with Gods children, as it is with a childe in the mothers
Armes; if the father violently layes hold upon his ſervant and beates him,
and thruſt, him out of doores for his demerits, there is ſuch a terrible reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from the fathers anger againſt the ſervant upon the childe, that the poor
childe falls a crying. So it is with the children of God, when they ſee God
in a terrible way, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aying hold upon wicked men, to execute wrath upon
them, they cry out, they are afraid leſt ſome evil ſhould befall them too. Oh
no, be of good comfort, <hi>The Lord is good, and a ſtrong hold in the day of
trouble, and knoweth them that truſt in him,</hi> when his anger is never
ſo great and general. So it is here; though this Iſrael be <hi>not my people,</hi> yet
<hi>the number of the children of Iſrael ſhall be as the ſand of the Sea</hi> for all
that, ſo you ſhall find it in the 15. <hi>ver.</hi> of that firſt of <hi>Nahum, Behold</hi> (ſaith
the Text) <hi>upon the mountains, the feete of him that bringeth good tidings.</hi>
What at this time though Gods way be <hi>in the whirl-winde</hi> and ſo terrible,
yet <hi>now</hi> behold the feete of him that bringeth good tydings, that publiſheth
peace. God abroad publiſheth war, yet he hath a meſſenger to publiſh life
and peace to ſome.</p>
               <p>Is it not ſo this day? It is true, the wrath of the Lord is kindled, the wrath
of the Lord burneth as an oven, and it is hot, but it is againſt the ungody,
but peace ſhall be upon Iſrael. And let us ſanctifie the name of God in this
too, for ſo it followes in this very <hi>Chap.</hi> of <hi>Nah. ver. 15. Oh Iudah keepe
thy ſolemne feaſts, performe thy vowes, for the wicked ſhall no more paſſe
through thee.</hi> And becauſe God revealeth ſuch rich grace in the middeſt of
judgement, let this engage your hearts to the Lord for ever.</p>
               <p>Yea a little further (becauſe it is an inſtraction of great uſe in theſe times,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:42662:39"/>
and may be yet of further uſe in times we may live to ſee (not onely when
God threatneth judgements, let us ſanctifie Gods name in looking up to
promiſes: but when judgements are actually upon us. Suppoſe we ſhould

way of his grace at that time, this is harder then in threatnings. You have an
notable place for that in <hi>Eſay, 26. 8. In the way of thy judgements, O Lord,
have we waited for thee, the deſire of our ſoule is to thy name.</hi> Oh bleſſed
be God (my brethren) the Lord calleth us to wait upon him in the wayes of
mercy for the preſent. It is true, there was a time not long ſince, that the
Lord was in a way of judgement toward England; and there were ſome of
Gods people, when he was in the wayes of his judgements amongſt us, yet
would wait upon God and keepe his wayes; though there were many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
Gods judgements were abroad, and they ſaw that they were like to
ſuffer, departed from God and declined his wayes. Much cauſe of bitterneſs
of ſpirit, and of dread of humiliation have they that did ſo: But others may
have comfort to their ſoules, that in the very wayes of Gods judgments they
waited for him, &amp; they can now with more comfort wait upon God when he
is in the ways of his mercy. But if God ſhould ever come untous in the ways
of his judgments, let us learne even then to wait upon God &amp; keep his way.</p>
               <p>And yet another Text that may ſeeme to be more notable than this for this
purpoſe, and that is <hi>Iere. 33. 24. Conſider eſt thou not what this people have
ſpoken, ſaying, the two families which the Lord hath choſen, he hath even
caſt them off; thus they have deſpiſed my people, that they ſhould be no more
a nation.</hi> Marke the low condition the people were in at this time: Oh,
<hi>God hath caſt them off,</hi> they are <hi>deſpiſed &amp; contemptible,</hi> not worthy to be
accounted <hi>a nation.</hi> This condition was very low: but though they were
brought low, &amp; in a condition contemptible, yet now God confirms his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
with them at this time. For obſerve, <hi>ver. 25. Thus ſaith the Lord. If
my Covenant be not with day &amp; night, and if I have not appointed the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
of heaven &amp; earth, then will I caſt away the ſeed of Iacob, ond Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid
my ſervant.</hi> As if God ſhould ſay, let them know that whatſoever their
condition is now, yet my love, my mercy, my faithfulneſs is toward them as
ſure as my covenant with day &amp; night, and as the ordinances of heaven and
earth. An admirable Text to help not onely nations, but particular perſons
when they are caſt under contempt by wicked &amp; ungodly men; yet at that
time the Lord is moſt ready to confirm his covenant with them, to be as ſure
as his covenant with day &amp; night, and heaven &amp; earth. This bringeth honour
to God when at ſuch times we can looke up to God and exerciſe our faith.
And indeed this is the glory, and dignity, and beauty of faith to exerciſe it
then, when Gods judgements are actually upon us.</p>
               <p>But what promiſes are theſe? They were not promiſes to any that then
lived: the promiſe that is here made, was to be fulfilled in future Ages, yet
it is brought in by the Prophet as a comfort to the people of God living
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:42662:40"/>
then in that time. Hence this excellent note that nearly concerns us.</p>
               <p>Gracious hearts are comforted with the promiſes of God made to the
Church,<note place="margin">Obſ.</note> though not to be fulfilled in their dayes. If the Church may proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and receive mercies from God, though I be dead and gone, and rotten
in the grave, yet bleſſed be God. When <hi>Jacob</hi> was to die, ſaith he unto <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph.
Behold I dye,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 48. 21</note> 
                  <hi>but God ſhall be with you and bring you again unto the
land of your fathers;</hi> he will fulfill his promiſes to you though I am dead.
Our fore-fathers, that generation of the Saints that lived a while ſince, how
comfortably would they have dyed if God before their death had revealed
to them, that within 3. or 4. or 7. yeares ſo much mercy ſhould come to
England as we now have ſeen in theſe dayes! Yea how comfortably ſhould
any of us have died (I appeal to any gracious heart here) ſuppoſe God ſhould
have taken thee away but this time two yeares, and he ſhould have ſaid thus
to thee, Go and be gathered to thy fathers in peace, within theſe two years
ſuch and ſuch things ſhall be done for England, as we now live to ſee; would
not we willingly have dyed? would it not have been comfort enough againſt
the fear of death but to have had revealed to us what ſhould have been done
in after time to our poſterity? what mercy then is it now, that it is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
revealed to us but enjoyed by us? That is the ſecond Note.</p>
               <p>But thirdly,<note place="margin">3.</note> What was this promiſe? This promiſe was that Iſrael ſhould
be a multitude, that the number of them ſhall be as the ſand of the ſea ſhore.
VVe ſhall examine the excellency of the mercy of God in this promiſe by
and by. Onely for the preſent, enquire we a little why God would expreſſe
himſelfe in this, that his grace ſhould be manifeſted, in this <hi>to multiply them
as the ſand of the ſea ſhore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we compare Scripture with Scripture, we ſhall finde that God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
promiſeth this, becauſe he would thereby ſhew, that he did remember
his old promiſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> for that was the promiſe made to <hi>Abraham</hi>
that God would <hi>multiply his ſeed as the ſtarres of heaven, and as the ſand
which is upon the ſea ſhore;</hi> and now God along time after commeth in
with renewing this promiſe. Hence we are to obſerve this Note.</p>
               <p>That the Lord remembers his promiſes though made a long time ſince.<note place="margin">Obſer.</note>
                  <hi>God is ever mindful of his Covenant,</hi> as it is, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111. 5.</p>
               <p>When we have ſome new and freſh manifeſtations of Gods mercy, our
hearts rejoyce in it, but the impresſion of it is ſoone gone. Many of you
when you have beene ſeeking God, have had many manifeſtations of his
love, and God hath entred into Covenant with you, &amp; for a while you have
been comforted, but you loſe all your comfort againe within a ſhort time:
Oh remember,<note place="margin">God is ever mindfull of his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, ſo we should be.</note> God is ever mindefull of his Covenant, though made 20.
40. years agoe, he remains the ſame ſtill, be you the ſame ſtill; be you ever
mindful of your Covenants. When men are brought into the bond of the
Covenant, their conſciences are awed with it, and they walke very ſtrictly,
and they clare not in the leaſt thing goe from the Covenant at firſt: But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a few moneths or weekes are over their heads, they forget their engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:42662:40"/>
their Covenant they made with God, there is not ſuch a ſtrong bond
upon their ſpirits as there was before. Oh my brethren, know that this is a
great and ſore evil in you; God is ever mindfull of his Covenant, ſo you
ſhould be. And as of his Covenant, ſo of his threats too, by way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion:
God remembreth his threats that were made many years agoe;
we are affected with Gods threats for the preſent, but within a while, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion

As if God ſhould have ſaid to <hi>Abraham; Abraham</hi> be willing to leave

               <p>Secondly, you ſhall obſerve that afterwards God confirmed this covenant
to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and that with an oath. It is very obſervable, when he came
firſt out of his countrey, and left his fathers houſe, God made this promiſe of
the encreaſing of his ſeed, but not with an oath; but afterwards in <hi>Gen.</hi> 22
16. God renews this promiſe of multiplying his ſeed, and that by an Oath;
for ſaith he, <hi>By my ſelfe have I ſworne, for becauſe thou haſt done this
thing, and haſt not witheld thy ſonne, thine onely ſon, that in blesſing I will
bleſſe thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy ſeed as the ſtars of the

the Lord, that I will do it, becauſe thou haſt done this.</p>
               <p>We have two moſt excellent notes from hence.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Obſerv</note> there is nothing loſt in being willing to loſe for God. <hi>Abraham</hi>
was willing to loſe his fathers houſe, the comfort of his family for God: <hi>I
will make thee a glorious family as the ſtars of heaven, ſaith God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, <hi>Abraham</hi> was willing to loſe one ſon, his onely ſon for God.
Art thou willing to loſe one ſon for me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thou ſhalt have ten thouſand ſons

ſhalt have thy own ſon, and yet have ten thouſand ſons beſides. Oh let us
not be afraid to part with any thing for God: Gods people they know how
to make up in God what ever they loſe for God: But God will not onely
make it up in himſelfe, but will make it up even in the very thing it ſelfe, the
creature it ſelfe thou loſeſt for God. Art thou willing to loſe a little of thy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate?
Thou mayſt with comfort expect (ſo far as if thou kneweſt all thou

way. You know the promiſe, <hi>He that forſaketh father, or mother, or wife
or children, or lands, or houſes for my ſake, ſhal have an hundred fold in this
world, and in the world to come life everlaſting.</hi> How hath God fulfilled
this this day in many of our eyes, and too many of our experiences! how
many have you known who have beene willing to part with that they had,
and to put it out (as it were) to the wide world; God hath made it up not
onely in himſelfe, but in the very thing it ſelfe, and thereby taught them and
all the world to be willing to venture for God, to part with any thing for him
and his cauſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Obſerv.</note> When we are willing to loſe for God, then is the time when
God will renew and confirm his Covenant with us. Then God confirmed
his covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> when he was willing to part with his ſonne, to
be deprived of all his ſeed. The way to be made ſure of what we have is to be
willing to part with it. You all deſire to be ſure of your eſtates, oh that we
could in theſe times, wherein we ſee nothing ſure make our eſtates ſure!
this is the deſire of every one. Would you make ſure of your eſtates? ſure!
illing to imploy your eſtates for God &amp; for a good cauſe: This is the way
to have God to renew his covenant to you for an aſſurance of that way.
Here is the beſt aſſurance office in the world.</p>
               <p>But how comes this in at this time, &amp; to his people in <hi>Hoſea</hi> his Propheſie?</p>
               <p>Thus it comes in now, becauſe the Lord by the Prophet would anſwer an
objection of the people. They might have ſaid thus, What <hi>Hoſea,</hi> doe you
thus threaten judgement, the deſtruction of Iſrael? why, you promiſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to Judah, and Judah is but a handful to us, we are the ten Tribes, &amp; with
us are the chiefe, the greateſt part, almoſt all the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and yet
you threaten our deſtruction, it can never poſſibly be: What will become
of Gods promiſe then? Did not God promiſe <hi>Abraham,</hi> that his ſeed
ſhould be as the ſtars of heaven, &amp; as the ſand on the ſea ſhore? you ſeeme
to goe croſſe to God, God ſaith that he would multiply that ſeed, and you
take a courſe to make men beleeve that the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould bee
brought into a narrow compaſſe and be nothing. Thus doubtleſs they were
ready to pleade againſt the Prophet. The Prophet anſwereth thus.</p>
               <p>What doe you ſay, what will become of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed? Know that
God can tell how to provide for his Church and fulfill his promiſe made to
<hi>Abraham</hi> whatſoever becomes of you, for you are miſtaken in thinking
you alone are the ſeed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> for you ſhall know that <hi>Abraham</hi>
hath not onely a carnal but a ſpiritual ſeed; all thoſe that ſhal come to joyne
in the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſubject themſelves to the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
they ſhall be the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſo they ſhall be the children of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
as well as you, and thus God will make good his word. And ſo the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 9. doth quote this Scripture about Gods caſting off of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Iſrael threatned here by <hi>Hoſea (ver. 25. As he ſaith alſo in Hoſea,
I will call them my people that were not my people:</hi> This is the very Text
that the Apoſtle there quoteth, though all the words are not quoted, and it is
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:42662:41"/>
a very good thing to acquaint your ſelves with the Scripture, and to ſee how
one Scripture lookes towards another, and ſpecially in the new Teſtament
to ſee how the old Teſtament is quoted.) This I ſay the Apoſtle applyeth to
the Gentiles; and the holy Ghoſt (who is the beſt interpreter of Scriptures)
there ſhewes, that it is at leaſt in part fulfilled in ſo many of the Gentiles
comming in, and being converted to the faith of the true Meſſia.</p>
               <p>There are this and many other excellent Propheſies concerning the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of Iſrael, that were made good in part in the firſt times of the Goſpel;
but that was but as the firſt fruites of the fulfilling of thoſe promiſes &amp; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies;
the accompliſhment of them is yet certainly to come, when the
fulneſſe of the Gentiles ſhall come in, and the Jews be converted; then not
onely the ſpiritual ſeed, but the very carnal ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhall have this
promiſe made good, and ſhall be multiplyed and come into the faith too.
<hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 26. The Apoſtle ſpeakes there of a general <hi>ſalvation of Iſrael,</hi>
that was yet to come <hi>after the fulneſſe of the Gentiles.</hi> So it appears plainly,
that thoſe Propheſies concerning the glory of Iſrael, though they were in
part made good in the firſt times of the Goſpel, yet there was a further ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment
of them after, when there ſhould <hi>be a fulneſſe of the Gentiles
come in,</hi> and then <hi>Iſrael ſhould be ſaved too.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I might ſpend a great deale of time in ſhewing how many promiſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the excellency of the Church were made good in part in the firſt
times of the Goſpel, and yet that but as the firſt fruites, and to be fully made
good afterwards. And certainly this promiſe (as we ſhall afterward come
to know) it is not yet throughly fulfilled: though it was in part made good
at the calling of the Gentiles, there is a further degree of it to be accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
another day, of which hereafter.</p>
               <p>From hence (the words being thus opened to you) take theſe obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

they are of Iſrael, and therefore have the ſame priviledges with Iſrael, the

of Abraham,</hi> who in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. is ſaid to be the <hi>heir of the world,</hi> they have the
dignity of Iſrael, to be the peculiar people of the Lord, to be the treaſure, to be
Gods portion. Whatſoever you reade of Iſrael, of excellent titles and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellations
about Iſrael. they belong now to all beleevers, though they be the
children of the Gentiles. A comfortable &amp; ſweet point to us of the Gentiles</p>
               <p>Secondly, God hath a time to bring in abundance of people to the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the faith, to bring in multitudes, even as the ſand of the ſea-ſhore. He
will do it, and he hath wayes enough to accompliſh it. Though there is for

                  <note place="margin">Prov. 14. 28,</note> ſo it is the glory of Jeſus
Chriſt, and therefore it was propheſied of him, that the Church ſhould
come in as the <hi>dew of the morning. Pſal.</hi> 110. 3.</p>
               <p>Thus it began in the Primitive times in the Apoſtles dayes, and preſently
after multitudes came into the Church. I remember <hi>Jerome</hi> Writing to
<hi>Cromatius,</hi> ſaith that there might be computed for every day in the yeere
(except in the firſt of January) five thouſand Martyrs: therfore the Church
was grown to a numerous multitude. And <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeakes in his time
that they were become ſo numerous then, that in his Apologetiques he tells
the Heathen that they had filled their Cities, and that if they would they had
ſtrength enough to make their party good againſt them, but they were pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
and ſubmitted themſelves to their Tyranny.</p>
               <p>I know many make this of <hi>Tertullian</hi> an argument that men muſt lay
down their necks, and ſuffer their throats to be cut, if thoſe that are above
them will it, and if they cannot obey actively, they muſt obey paſſively any
thing that is acording to the will of ſuch as are over them. Why (ſay they) did
not the Chriſtians ſo in the Primitive times? Yes, the Chriſtians did ſo, they
though they were under Idolaters, and were commanded to deny Chriſt,
which was utterly unlawful; yet though they could not obey actively, they
obeyed pasſively, they did ſubject and ſubmit themſelves to all their rage;
and though they had ſtrength, yet they would not reſiſt. Why ſhould not
Chriſtians do ſo now? You are exceedingly gulled with this argument ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times: true, we are bound to obey authority actively or pasſively, and
yet this argument doth not ſerve the turne. There is a great deale of differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
between authority abuſed, &amp; men that are in authority commanding;
here the difference lies not in authority abuſed, but in that which is no autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:42662:42"/>
at all. For there is no authority that we are ſubject to now, but (as I have
ſaid heretofore) according to the Laws and conſtitutions of the Countrey
where we live.<note place="margin">Anſwer to the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Primitive times a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny.</note> Not to the commands &amp; meer wils of men till it be brought
to a Law are we bound in conſcience to ſubmit, no way, neither actively nor
pasſively; though it be a good thing that is commanded, Conſcience doth
not bind to it, <hi>earatione,</hi> to yeeld to it, becauſe it is commanded, till it be
brought to a Law. Now when things are brought into a Law, &amp; be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the agreements and covenants of the place and countrey wherein we
live. And then ſuppoſe this authority be abuſed, &amp; there be an ill Law made,
then I confeſſe (if that Law be of force) wee muſt either quit our ſelves
of the Countrey or elſe ſubmit or ſuffer, for then the power of God is in it,
though it be abuſed, and we are to be ſubject to all powers. When then it
comes once to be a power, to be a Law, it is authority, though abuſed, and
we muſt yeeld obedience to it either actively or pasſively. But we muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
whether it be a power; It is not becauſe the man that is in authority
commandeth it, except he command it by vertue of that authority, which
is according to the nature and condition of the fundamental conſtitutions
of the Countrey where he liveth.</p>
               <p>Now in the Primitive times they ſubmitted themſelves to ſuffer when
they could not do the things that were commanded (as to deny Chriſt) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
by the conſtitutions of that Countrey they had ſuch a kinde of power
given to them, a legal power to proceed againſt them; ſo that they had a
power in their way given them, and they had authority, but they abuſed it in
that they did. And therefore the Chriſtians were ſo willing rather to ſuffer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing than to reſiſt, and were ours the ſame caſe wee ſhould do ſo too, if
once it come to paſſe that miſchiefe be eſtabliſhed by a Law, though it be
miſchiefe, yet if we cannot obey it actively we are bound to ſuffer or elſe
to quit the Countrey, one of the two, if it be urged upon us: We may ſeek
what we can to get it alleviated, but we muſt either do or ſuffer if once it be
framed into a Law, otherwiſe we are not bound in conſcience, bound wee
may be in regard of prudence, and in regard of preventing other diſturban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
but conſcience doth not bind to wils of men, but binds to Laws.</p>
               <p>Thus much ſtill, for the ſatisfaction of Conſcience in this caſe.</p>
               <p>But to come to what I brought this in for. The Chriſtians were wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
encreaſed at this time. Now we know this is the point; We are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
when the Church is increaſed, and to eſteeme it as the great blesſing
of God when they are made as the ſand upon the ſea-ſhore. There is an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
place for this in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72. where there is a large propheſie made of
the Kingdome of Chriſt and of his Glory in this particular, <hi>ver. 8. He ſhal
have dominion from ſea to ſea, and from the rivers to the end of the earth,</hi>
then <hi>ver. 11. All Kings ſhall fall downe before him, and all Nations ſhall
ſerve him:</hi> and <hi>ver. 17. His name ſhall endure for ever, and ſhall continue
as long as the ſunne, and men ſhall be bleſſed in him, all Nations ſhall call
him bleſſed.</hi> Now marke upon this, how the Saints rejoyce and bleſs God,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:42662:43"/>
VVhat ſhall all Nations come in and ſerve Chriſt? ſhall there come multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes

                  <hi>Oh bleſſed be the Lord God, the God

               <p>My brethren this is a good and conſely ſight in a gracious eye to ſee mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
come in &amp; to flock to Chriſt and to his Ordinances. It is true indeed,
the ſpirit of Antichriſt that is in many makes them that they cannot look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his but with a malevolent eye, and their hearts do vexe, and rage, and fiet
at this, as much as at any thing, they love ſcattering of them up and downe,
but to ſee people come flocking to Ordinances, to ſee multitudes come in
and joyne themſelves to Chriſt, this they cannot endure.</p>
               <p>The ſame malicious ſpirit that was againſt Chriſt, that we reade of in the
Acts of the Apoſtles, yea, and in the Goſpel too, wee finde it ſtill in ſuch
kinde of men. Marke that Text, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 44, 45. There it is ſaid that <hi>almoſt
the whole Cittie came together to hear the word of God,</hi> to heare a Sermon.
Now <hi>the Phariſes when they ſaw the multitude they were filled with envie:</hi>
Why what hurt was there done? They ſaw no hurt done, but meerely ſaw
the multitude, and they ſpeake againſt thoſe things that were ſpoken by
<hi>Paul</hi> contradicting and blaſpeming: <hi>When they ſaw the multitude,</hi> they
could have borne it otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>Marke againe the vile ſpirits of the Phariſees that envied at the multitude
that followed Chriſt himſelfe: not onely did they envy at the Apoſtles, for
they might be factious and ſingular men in their eſteem, but what ſay you
to Chriſt himſelfe? <hi>John. 12. 19. The Phariſees ſaid, behold, perceive yee
how ye prevaile nothing? behold, the world followes him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Certainly the ſame Phariſaical ſpirit hath beene a prelatical ſpirit in our
dayes. We know it hath beene matter enough for a godly, painful, conſcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Miniſter to be outed of all he hath at an inſtant, and his mouth to be
ſtopped, meerly upon this, though they had nothing againſt him, no, not for
their own Laws, but becauſe he was a popular man, and multitudes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
him. What a dangerous thing hath it beene of late times for men to
be popular, that is, to bee ſuch as multitudes ſhall come and flock to the
word preached by them. Certainly it is an evil ſpirit, for the promiſe of God
to his Church is, that there ſhall come multitudes and joyne with the people
of God in the way of his Ordinances.</p>
               <p>Yea but it may be they do not envy at all that multitudes ſhould follow
that that is good,<note place="margin">Object.</note> but it is the humour and pride of ſuch men to have multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
to follow after them.<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> Take heed firſt of putting this off with ſuch a
plea. Conſider whether it will hold at that great day. The Devil himſelf did
never plead againſt Chriſt or any of his wayes, but with ſome colour or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:42662:43"/>
And ſurely theſe men they judge thus by looking into their own hearts,
becauſe they know that if multitudes ſhould come to them, it could not be
but their hearts would be lifted up, and ſo they judge accordingly of others.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe it be ſo (for men are men) that they through corruption ſhould
have any ſuch workings of pride, yet do they ſay anything that is not juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyable?
do they preach any thing that is not according to Chriſt? If they do
not, then thou ſhouldeſt encourage that which is good, and for that which is
evill leave it to the comming of Chriſt, except thou canſt by prayer and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
helpe it, have it I ſay till then. It is worſe to envy at multitudes now
then it was for the Jewes to envy <hi>Paul</hi> for multitudes following him, for
they thought they could contradict him in what he ſaid, and therefore for
multitudes to follow ſuch as ſhould preach falſe doctrine (as they thought
<hi>Paul</hi> did) they had ſome colour to contradiet it, &amp; to envy at the multitudes
following of him. But here it is nothing elſe in the World but meerely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
multitudes come to heare the world, for though men firſt preach in
corners privately, where they have but a few auditors, they will cry out of
that, well, if they preach publikely, and multitudes come to hear them, then
they cry out of that too. Nothing at all will pleaſe them, nothing can pleaſe
envious &amp; malicious ſpirits.<note place="margin">Malice of Satan envy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ina multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the word.</note> If we keep our ſelves retyred, that hath excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
enough, and then if we come in a publicke way, they have exceptions at
that too. Here the groſſe malice of Satan appeareth, becauſe when the thing
it ſelfe cannot be excepted againſt, he runs to the intention of the heart. and
to mens inward aymes, and bringeth an argument of that which he knows
no man can confute him in: For who can ſay that that is either true or falſe
that men have inward aymes of pride, and vaine glory, and ſelfe-ſeeking in
multitudes, flocking after them?</p>
               <p>Here is the wiſdome of the ſerpent too, becauſe if they goe upon other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
they may be anſwered by all the world that there is no ſuch thing as
they pretend, but put them from thoſe, and you may be ſure to have ſuch ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
as no man can anſwer: Oh but (ſay they) their hearts are lifted up
and they have ill aymes and ill intentions. Who can anſwer this objection?
no body can confute this. Nay ſuppoſe we profeſſe before the Lord &amp; Chriſt
as we deſire to ſtand before him, and anſwer it at that day what our aimes
are, this will not ſerve the turne. Why then (my brethren) if men will chooſe
ſuch an argument as cannot posſibly come to be anſwered before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Chriſt, and ſo make a ſtumbling-block, there is no help but men muſt
ſtumble and fall, and many do ſtumble and fall, and break their necks.</p>
               <p>How ever let <hi>wiſdom be juſtified of her children;</hi> Let the Saints rejoyce
in this, that multitudes come in to the miniſtery of the word and to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
of Chriſt. Be careful and wiſe in this, and give no juſt occaſion,
and therefore give all due reſpect that posſibly can be to thoſe you have the
moſt relation unto.</p>
               <p>This you ſee is the promiſe that there ſhall come in ſuch multitudes to the
Church. But marke then how the promiſe runnes;</p>

               <p>I doe not ſay that this is the intention, but ſurely the intention of God is
mainly this, to ſignifie the multitudes that ſhould come into the Church:
Onely this alluſion we may make uſe of, as being a comfortable and pretty

from drowning the world: and indeed were it not for the Church of God,
the waves of Gods wrath that are abroad would overflow all the world, and

               <p>This according to ſome hath reference to the very land of Canaan it ſelfe,
that God will have a very glorious Church there, ſpecially in Jeruſalem be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the end of the world come, and many Propheſies ſeeme to encline that
way, as <hi>Zach. 12. 6. Jeruſalem ſhall be inhabited againe, even in Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi>
This cannot be meant onely of their returne out of Captivity that was
in <hi>Cyrus</hi> his time, for the Text ſaith, <hi>In that day thee feeble among them
ſhall be as David, and the houſe of David ſhall be as the Angel of God, &amp;
God will poure upon them the ſpirit of grace &amp; ſupplication, and they ſhall

upon them then; for if you read the ſtory of it,<note place="margin">Lect. 5.</note> you ſhal find that even all that
while they were in a contemptible condition before the nations about them.
But God ſpeaks here and in other places of a glorious returne of their cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,
&amp; coming into their own Land. The Jewes have a tradition, (<hi>Bux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torfius</hi>

where ever they dye, ſhall come through <hi>Meatus terrae,</hi> and riſe againe at

at leaſt to prevent the trouble of coming through thoſe <hi>Meatus terra</hi>
that they ſpeake of. Thus they are deluded in their conceits.</p>
               <p>But yet more generally, <hi>In that place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereas the place of my people was confined into a little and narrow
roome, hereafter it ſhall be inlarged, and even among the Gentiles that ſhal
be made ſpiritual Iſrael, where I was not known, among the Heathen, even
there ſhall I come to be known, and I ſhall have a people there, and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
people, but ſons, the ſons of the living God, and that ſo apparently, that
it ſhall be ſaid unto them. <hi>Yee are the ſonnes of the living God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſeems to interpret this place, in the 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 10. ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Gentiles whom God would have a people among them, ſaith the
Apoſtle, <hi>Which in times paſt were not a people, but are now the people of God.</hi>
Generally Interpreters doe conclude that the Apoſtle had reference to this
very place in <hi>Hoſea:</hi> And ſo we may build then upon this interpretation
howſoever, that it is the intention of the Spirit of God, that God would call
home the Gentiles to himſelf, &amp; ſo they that were no people ſhould become
his people, his ſons: It ſhould be ſaid in that place where before it was ſaid
that <hi>they knew him not,</hi> that now they are <hi>his ſons.</hi> Yea the Heathen ſhal be
brought in, ſo as they ſhall be convinced of the vanity of their Idolatry. We
worſhipped dead ſtocks; our gods were dead ſtones &amp; ſtocks that we were
vaſſals unto; but now we ſee a people that is come in to the profesſion of this
Chriſtian Religion, they worſhip the living God, their God is the true God,
certainely here are the ſons of the living God.<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> This is the ſcope of the holy
Ghoſt. For obſervation. 1. It is a comfortable thing to conſider that in thoſe

Countreys and Towns that have lived in darkneſs &amp; Idolatry, ſhould now
have the knowledge of the true God, that the true God ſhould come to be

<hi>you are not my people,</hi> where there was nothing but a company of ſavage
barbarous creatures that worſhipped the Devill; how in this place, in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland
is it ſaid, even by the nations round about us, <hi>ſurely they are the

ſome faithful Miniſter to carry the light of the knowledge of Chriſt unto
them, and efficaciouſly to work faith in their hearts, and now, oh what an
alteration is there in that towne! the like of a family. It may be ſaid of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a houſe and family,<note place="margin">A comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thing to have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ſet up in Townes &amp; families, where once it was not.</note> in which nothing but blaſphemy, and atheiſme, and

been, now it is a family filled with the ſervants and ſonnes of the living God.
As it is a grievous thing to think of a place wherein God hath been truely
worſhipped, that afterward the Devil ſhould come to be ſerved there, ſo it
is a comfortable thing to think of other places wherein the Devil hath beene
ſerved, that God is truly worſhipped there. Some ſtories report that the
Turkes having poſſeſſion of the Temple at Jeruſalem, there where was the
Arke, and the Cherubins, and the Seraphims, there now are Tygres, and
Beares, and ſavage creatures; But on the other ſide to conſider that in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

of Judah, they ſhall ſay in their hearts, our ſtrength is in the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of Jeruſalem, in the Lord of Hoſts their God. Howſoever they were
heretofore ſcandalized, as ſeditious, and factious, and as enemies of the State,
yet now the Governours of Judah ſhall acknowledge that their ſtrength is in
them, and in the Lord their God, that this Lord of Hoſts is their God. That
time will be a bleſſed time when the Governours of Judah ſhall come to be
convinced of this; when God ſhall ſo manifeſt the excellencies of his Saints,
as that both great and ſmal ſhall confeſſe them to be the ſonnes of the living
God.<note place="margin">The world shall one day be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Saints.</note> It is promiſed to the Church of <hi>Philadelphia, Revel.</hi> 3. 9. that the

then they ſhall know that I the Lord do ſanctifie Iſrael, when the beauty of
my ordinances ſhall appeare in them, then they ſhall know it.</p>
               <p>And if God be not onely ſatisfied in doing good to his people, but hee
will have the world know it, and be convinced of it; Let the people of God
then not be ſatisfied onely in having their hearts upon God, but let the world
know that they love God too. You muſt do that that may make it appeare
to all the world, that you are the children of the living God. <hi>Let your light

another thing to do a thing that it may be ſeen. And yet Gods people may do
both, not do good onely that may be ſeen, but (if they keepe ſtill the glory of
God above in their eye, as the higheſt ayme) they may deſire and be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
too that it may be ſeene to the praiſe of God. But this I confeſſe requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
ſome ſtrength of grace to do it, and yet to keep the heart upright. The
excellency of grace doth conſiſt not in caſting off the outward comforts of
the world, but to know how to enjoy them, and to over-rule them unto
God: ſo the ſtrength of grace doth conſiſt, not in forbearing of ſuch actions
as are taken notice of by men, or not to dare to ayme at the publiſhing of
thoſe things that have excellency in them; but the ſtrength of grace conſiſts
in this, in having the heart enabled to do this, and yet to keepe it under too,
and to keep God above in his right place.</p>

and then what need I care what all the World thinks of me. God doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
it as a bleſſing to have his people called the children of God, then this
muſt not be ſlighted. You ſhall find it often in the Goſpel that Chriſt made
a great buſineſſe of this to make it manifeſt to the world that he was ſent of
God, he would have them to know that his Father ſent him, and that hee
came from him: So the people of God ſhould count it a bleſſing, and walk

               <p>For this is ſpoke of the eſtate of the Church under the Goſpell, They were
Gods people indeed under the Law, but the ſonnes of the living God, this

of that glorious ſon-ſhip that they ſhall have under the times of the

is very little of our adoption in Chriſt revealed in the Old Teſtament, No,

there was then: but in the time of the Goſpel more affliction, becauſe the
diſpoſitions of the hearts of people ſhould not be ſo mercenary as they were
before, they ſhould be an ingenuous, a willing people in the day of

and preſently to be amazed. Hath not God revealed himſelfe to us as a

himſelfe,<note place="margin">Sons muſt not feare.</note> not with a ſervile ſear as men do, and therefore ſurely not to fear
men be they what they will be. We are ſons.</p>
               <p>Again, Not only ſons, for ſo we might find in Scripture, where the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God under the Law, perhaps are ſometimes called ſo, but elder ſons,
ſons come to yeares. It is true, they were before us, and ſo in that reſpect
we are not elder; bnt ſons that are come to our inheritance, that is it I mean
that we are ſuch ſons; Not children under tutorage, not under School-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
and governours, as they were in the time under the Law. You know
what compariſon the Scripture makes of the difference betweene the
Church in the time of the Goſpell, and that in the time of the Law. In the
time of the Law it is true indeed they were <hi>children,</hi> but how? they were
children that were <hi>under tuttors and Governours,</hi> they were not as yet
come to years, they were but as young children that were put out to ſchool.
But now as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Gal. 4. 15. Chrſt hath redeemed us from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
under the Law, that we might receive the adoption of ſonnes:</hi> marke,
<hi>that we might receive it,</hi> ſo that now the ſtate of the Church is like unto a
child that cometh to be of age, and ſo is freed from his Tutors and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors,
and cometh to his inheritance, <hi>ſui juris,</hi> as it were, ſo is the ſtate of
the Church now.</p>
               <p>Therefore the Saints now are not to be dealt withal, as if ſtil they were in
their childiſh condition. Now how were the Jewes dealt withall, becauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>they
were in their childiſh condition? Thus, they had outward externall
ethings to gain them to ſerve God, they worſhipped God much in externall
things: As we deale with children, we give them apples and fine things
to get them to doe what we would have them do, ſo God dealt with them:
And as children when they begin to learne, they muſt have a great many
gayes in their book; ſo God taught the Jewes with outward ceremonies,
which afterward the Scripture calls but beggarly rudiments, poor things.
Children you know are pleaſed much with gay things, and they that would
bring in Jewiſh ceremonies, or ceremonies of their own invention in the
Church, they make account the Church is in her childiſh condition ſtill, as
if gay things would pleaſe them, therefore they muſt have pictures, and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages,
and ſuch things to pleaſe people, this makes the people of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
themſelves as if they were yet children, and were to be pleaſed with
ſuch things as theſe. No, now in the ſtate of the Goſpel they are come to
the adoption of ſons. And ſo children you know are pleaſed as with fſghts,
ſo with hearing of muſick, and pipes, and ſuch things, ſo men would bring
ſuch things ſtill into the Church in the time of the Goſpel. I remember
<hi>Iuſt. Martyr</hi> in the 107. <hi>queſt. ad orthodoxos,</hi> in anſwer to that about
muſicall inſtruments, he ſaith that they are fit for children and fooles, as

and honourable, as a man that is grown to be a man, would think himſelfe
wronged much to be taught as a childe, to be put off with gay things; ſo
ſhould the people of God under the goſpell think it a great wrong that hath
been done to them, when men have ſought to teach them with gayes and

               <p>Iſrael that was caſt off from God, now ſhall be brought in more fully

               <p>When God is pleaſed to be reconciled to a people,<note place="margin">Obſerv.</note> he is as fully theirs as
ever, yea ſometimes more fully. He comes rather with more full grace

               <p>People before, but ſons now. O what an incouragement is this to all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtatizing

be reconciled to God, and thou ſhalt not only find God as good as ever
thou didſt, but thou ſhalt find him much better and much ſweeter then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
thou didſt in all thy life. It is ſeldome we are ſo. When men fall out
one with another, though poſſibly they may be reconciled, yet it is ſeldome
that they are ſo fully reconciled, ſo fully one as they were before; they are
but as a broken veſſell ſodered together, that is very weake in the ſodering
place; or as garments that have been rent, and are mended, ſoon torn and
quickly ready to fall in pieces in the place where they were mended; It is
not ſo between God and a penitent ſoule.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>ſons,</hi> not onely of <hi>God,</hi> but of the <hi>living God.</hi> There is much in
this, that the people of <hi>God</hi> under the goſpell ſhould be called <hi>the ſons of the

this he is diſtinguiſhed from the heathen gods, that hee is the living <hi>God.</hi>
Life is the moſt excellent thing in the world; <hi>Auguſtine</hi> therefore ſaith, that
the life of a very fly is more excellent then the Sun in the Firmament: and
certainly it is the glory of God, that he is the living God. And as <hi>God</hi> is the

               <p>This is a treaſure of comfort to his people that he is called the living God

that is in him ſhall be active for the good of his Church for ever, hee will

                  </gap> what we read of Gods a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiveneſs
for the good of his Church in former times, to plead with God to

uſe of the former activeneſs of God, <hi>Iſa. 51. 9. Awake, Awake, put on

If they might make uſe of former times, much more in our times of the
goſpell may we make uſe of former times, and plead with God, O Lord
haſt thou not ſhewn thy ſelfe glorious in defence of thy people, in helping
thy fervants in their great ſtraits, and in deſtroying thine enemies? wilt not
thou be ſo ſtill? In the times of the goſpel, we may expect more activenes
of God then ever he manifeſted ſince the world begun. Therefore when
God would ſet out the ſtate of the Church of the goſpel, mark how he takes
that title to himſelfe. <hi>Revel. 4. 9. The 4. living creatures</hi> (mentioned in
the verſes before, by which is meant the ſtate of the Church under the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel)
<hi>they give glory, and honour, &amp; thanks to him that ſate on the throne,
who liveth for ever and ever:</hi> and <hi>ver. 10. The 24. Elders fell downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Him that ſate on the Throne, and worſhipped Him that liveth for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

and the 24. Elders fell downe and worſhipped him that liveth for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

and upon the earth, lifted up his hand and ſware by him that liveth for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
and ever.</hi> Thus the attribute of Gods life is made uſe of for the ſtate of
the Church in the goſpell, to ſhew how active God will be for them.
Thence <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 22. the Church is called <hi>The Cities of the living God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now then if we expect that <hi>God</hi> ſhould be a living <hi>God</hi> unto us, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
not us to have dead hearts in his ſervice. If <hi>God</hi> be active for our
good, let us be active for his honour. A living and a lively Chriſtian is
beautifull in the eyes of <hi>God</hi> and man. Let us labour not onely to be liviing,
but to be lively for <hi>God</hi> and his cauſe. Abundance of ſervice, and good,
may living and lively Chriſtians do in the places where they live, ſpecially
in theſe times. But oh what a few are there who are active and ſtirring, and
are carryed on by the ſpirit of wiſdome and zeale, for God and his cauſe!
Away now with out cold and dead wiſhes, and luskiſh deſires, let us up,

muſt needs be active, ſeeing his grace is the very life of God in him.</p>
               <p>By being lively and active, we ſhall prevent abundance of temptations,
that otherwiſe will befallus: a dead luskiſh ſpirit is lyable to a thouſand
temptations: as when the honey is ſcalding hot and boyling, the flies will
not come to it; when it is ſet in the window and grows cold, then the flies
come to it: ſo when the ſpirits of men are boyling hot for God, Belzebub
the god of flies with his temptations, comes not then upon them, but when
their ſpirits begin to cool, and grow dull and heavy, then comes Belzebub,
then comes all manner of temptation upon the ſoule. The breath that
comes from life, we know it is warme breath, but artificiall breath that is
cold; the breath that comes from the body of a man, that's hot, but the
breath that cometh from a paire of Bellows, that is cold, becauſe it is arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall
breath: ſo when men are cold in the ſervices of God, it is to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that their breath in praying and other duties, it is but artificiall breath,
it is not the breath of life, if it were living, it would be warm. That was
the reaſon why God would not have an aſſe offered him in the Law in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
but his neck muſt be broken, becauſe the aſſe is a dull creature, God
loves not dull creatures in his ſervice.</p>
               <p>I remember I have heard of a people that worſhipped the ſunne for their
god, they ſacrificed to the ſun a flying horſe; the reaſon was this, becauſe
they would offer to the ſun ſomewhat ſutable to it; they honoured the ſun
for the ſwiftneſs of his motion, and a horſe you know is a ſwift creature,
and therefore ſomewhat ſutable, eſpecially having that emble me upon him,
with wings. They that would honour the ſun as a god for ſwiftnes would
not offer a ſnayle, but a flying horſe; ſo if wee do honour God for a living
God, an active God, let us not offer ſnayles to him, dull, heavy, ſluggiſh
ſervices, but quick and lively ſervices.</p>
               <p>That which the Courtiers of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> flatteringly ſaid to him,

               <p>Secondly, when you have company do not lag behind, but he willing to

<hi>very comely,</hi> why? becauſe the he-goat uſeth to go before the flock. Thoſe
that out of love to the cauſe of God are willing (if they be called to it) to
goe before the flock, they goe comely in the eyes of God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, do not forbear the work till all difficulties about it be firſt over.
That is a ſluggiſh ſpirit that wil not ſet about the work till they can ſee how
all the difficulties about the worke are or may be removed. You muſt up

working, wiſely to prevent and avoid the difficulties that come in it; As
thoſe active ſpirits did that we read of in <hi>Nehem.</hi> 4. 17. when they were at
work, with one of their hands they wrought, and with the other hand they
held a weapon; they did not ſtay the building of the wall of Jeruſalem till
all their adverſaries were quaſhed; but prefently they fell to it, and with one
hand they wrought in the work, and with the other held a weapon. This is
an active ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Further, we muſt not be active in a ſudden mood, &amp; upon a meer flaſh,
and ſo gone,<note place="margin">Active &amp; yet ſolid.</note> but in a conſtant ſolid way; Active, yet ſolid. Many indeed
are ſtirring and active for the preſent, but as the flame of a wiſpe of ſtraw
that makes a noiſe, and a great ſtir for the preſent, but ſoone after there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains

Therefore obſerve, the Scripture ſaith (ſpeaking of the Saints ſpecially in

be active ſolidly, and therefore grow ſlight and vain in their activity: and
many others ſtriving to be ſolid and ſubſtantiall, they quicly grow dull:
many through a kind of affected gravity, they would forſooth be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

both together, that is acceptable to God, to be living ſtones before him.</p>

                  <hi>Ver.</hi> 11. Then ſhall the children of Judah, and the children of Iſrael
be gathered together, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Here you have a promiſe both to <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> together. Great was
the enmity between <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> heretofore. They worſhipped the
ſame God, but in divers manners. One worſhipped God according to his
owne inſtitution, Judah did. And Iſrael worſhipped the ſame God, but
after their own ways, according to their own inventions, ſo as might beſt
ſute with their politique ends. There was a great deale of bitterneſſe and
vexation between theſe two people, though worſhipping the ſame God;
and God here makes it a great matter to bring theſe two together, that
they ſhould be gathered together in one. For that here wee have the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe:
Firſt, that there ſhall be an union: Secondly, that there ſhall be an
union under one head.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that there ſhall be an union. Hence then the firſt obſervation is this:</p>
               <p>The enmity of ſuch as ſeem not much different in matters of Religion,
and yet do differ, is ſometime exceeding great and bitter.</p>
               <p>There ſhall be an union between Judah and Iſrael ſaith God. Here is a
mercy,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> here is a wonderful worke of the Lord. In that God doth I ſay
make this ſo great a matter, this obſervation doth ſpring forth of the Text
clearly, that many times between ſuch as profeſſe the ſame Religion, and
ſeem not to differ much, and yet do differ, their oppoſitions are moſt bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and ineconcileable, and requires a mighty worke of God to bring them
in and reconcile them.</p>
               <p>It appears it was ſo between Judah and Iſrael. I will give you but one
Text for it, 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 28. 9. The Prophet <hi>Obed</hi> tells the children of Iſrael,
when he came to reprove them after the ſlaughter committed by them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the children of Judah, ſaith he, <hi>Ye have ſlain them in a rage that reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
up to heaven.</hi> What a rage was this this? and yet thus the people of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>
were inraged againſt the people of <hi>Iudah,</hi> their oppoſition was very
bitter, yea, more bitter were they many times one againſt another, then
they were againſt the Heathen, the Philiſtims, and Aſſyrians, and Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
that were round about them, they were nothing ſo bitter againſt them,
as they were one againſt another.</p>
               <p>Thus it hath been, and (untill that bleſſed time come that here is ſpoken
of in the Text) thus it will be. You know the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> and <hi>Lut he rans,</hi>
though they agree together againſt <hi>Papiſts</hi> in the main fundamental things,
yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

together with <hi>Luther</hi> for great ends and purpoſes for the furtherance of the
Goſpell, yet ſuch bitterneſs was between them.</p>
               <p>And hath it not been ſo amongſt us? Thoſe that are Proteſtants and ſuch
as are nick-named Puritans, though they do agree in all the fundamentall
points againſt popery, yet becauſe there is ſome difference in matter of
diſcipline and ceremonies, Oh what bitterneſſe of ſpirit is there? and it is
ſo much the more ſinfull in thoſe who ſay themſelves that diſcipline and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
are but in different things, they themſelves are ſpecially to be
blamed for bitterneeſſe on their ſide, becauſe the conſcience of the other is
bound up and cannot yeeld, yea, not only ſuch as doe contend againſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
diſcipline, but ſuch as doe goe a further degree in reformation of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
it ſelfe, yet becauſe they are differing in ſome few particulars, oh
the bitterneſs of ſpirit that is many times even among them!</p>
               <p>Theſe are times that call all the people of God to ſee what they can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
in, and in that to joyne againſt the common adverſary, and not to tear
one another by diſſentions. God may juſtly give us over to our adverſaries,
if we agree not among our ſelves, and they may chaine us together: Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
a Priſon may make us agree, as it was ſaid of <hi>Ridley</hi> and <hi>Hooper;</hi>
though <hi>Ridley</hi> ſtood much againſt <hi>Hooper</hi> in point of ceremonies, and
they could not agree, yet when they came to Priſon they did well enough
there.<note place="margin">A priſon will make men to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</note> The Lord deliver us from that medicine of our diſſentions, that wee
be not made ſo to agree; Yea that we be not ſodered together by our own
blood.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2.</note> God hath a time to gather <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> both together,
that is, to bring peace to his Church: God hath a time to gather all his

peace amongſt his Churches.</p>
               <p>For thought it is true it be meant here of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> literally, yet
<hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> is to ſet out to us all the Churches of God that ſhall bee
afterwards among the Gentiles: and as God will fulfill this Scripture lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:42662:50"/>
ſo he will fulfill it in the ſpirituall ſenſe, to bring Judah and Iſrael,
that is, all the Churches of God to be under one head. <hi>Iſa. 11. 13. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim
ſhall not envy Iudah, and Iudah ſhall not envy Ephraim.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim
envyed Judah, becauſe Judah challenged to himſelfe the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of God, and Judah on the other ſide envyed Ephraim, becauſe hee
was the greateſt, there was vexing ſpirits one againſt another: this ſhall not
alvvays be, ſaith God, but <hi>the envy of Ephraim ſhall depart,</hi> I will take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
this envious, this vexatious ſpirit. Thoſe two ſtaves the holy Ghoſt
ſpeaks of in <hi>Zach.</hi> 11. 10, 11. 14. the <hi>ſtaffe of beauty,</hi> and <hi>the ſtaffe of
bands,</hi> they were both <hi>broken,</hi> but God hath a time to <hi>unite</hi> together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and for that mark that excellent prophecie in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. 16, 17. 22.
24. There you ſhall find fully ſet out Gods bringing Judah and Iſrael to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and joyning thoſe ſticks together again. <hi>Son of man</hi> (ſaith the Text
there) <hi>take thee one ſticke and write upon it, for Iudah and for the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Iſrael his companions, &amp; then take another ſticke, &amp; write upon
it, for Ioſeph the ſticke of Ephraim, &amp; for all the houſe of Iſrael his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions;
and joyne them one to another into one ſticke, &amp; they ſhall become
one in thy hand.</hi> And then <hi>ver.</hi> 19. this is interpreted of the union of them,
<hi>Behold I will take the ſtick of Ioſeph which is in the hand of Ephraim, &amp;
will put them with the ſtick of Iudah, &amp; make them one ſticke, &amp; they ſhal
be one in mine hand:</hi> And <hi>verſ. 22. I will make them one Nation in the
land upon he mountains of Iſrael, &amp; one King ſhall be King to them all:</hi>
And in the 24. <hi>ver.</hi> that King is ſaid to be <hi>David</hi> which we ſhall afterward
ſhew more fully, when we ſhall come to ſhew this head that they ſhall be
under. Now this God hath never yet fulfilled, that the ten Tribes, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah
and Benjamine ſhould come together, and be ſet in one ſtick, he hath
never ſet together the ſtaffe of bonds that was broken, and yet this muſt be
done, and it is the great bleſſing of God upon his Churches, the bringing
about of this union one with another. Mark that Text for this purpoſe,
<hi>Ier.</hi> 33. God having promiſed having promiſed there in the 10. <hi>ver.</hi> that

God had promiſed to the houſes of Iſrael and Iudah? That good thing (my

good thing. <hi>Behold how good &amp; pleaſant a thing it is for brethren to live

ſhall be as the ſand of the ſea:<note place="margin">1.</note> when there ſhall be ſuch multitudes
comming in and flocking to the Church, yet then they ſhall be united into
one, and then there ſhall be peace in the Churches. It is not a hard matter
when there are but very few of a Church, perhaps halfe a dozen or halfe a
ſcore, for them then to be of one mind, and to agree in one lovingly toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and to have no diviſions nor diſſentions among themſelves; but when
a Church grows to be a multitude, and a great many, then there lies the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty.

about any buſineſſe, it is mighty hard to bring them to be united
in one. There are few families that have many perſons in it, but quickly
diſſentions and brablings grow among them: perhaps where there are two
or three in a family they keep well enough together: but where there are
many, where there are but ſeven in a family, they cannot ſo well agree, nor
ſo long a time together as the ſeven Devills did in <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> they
agreed better and longer then many a ſeven in a family: But God hath
made this promiſe to the Church, that though it ſhall increaſe as the ſand

yet they ſhall be all gathered together into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

but when they ſhall come to enjoy their full priviledges, and the full liberty
that Chriſt hath purchaſed for them, even then there ſhal be a bleſſed agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
For it is ſpoken here of thoſe times when they ſhall come under one
head, and Chriſt alone ſhall rule them, and not mens inventious; Chriſt will
grant his Church thoſe priviledges that he hath purchaſed for them, &amp; rule
them according to thoſe, and then there ſhall be a bleſſed agreement among
them all. Men now think it imposſible that the Church ſhould have thoſe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
Chriſt hath purchaſed without diſſentions, oh ſay they, grant them
but ſuch and ſuch things, let them have but ſuch liberty as they ſpeak of, and
we ſhall have nothing but brabling and diviſions; what ſhall every man be
left to do what he liſt? why then we ſhall have nothing but breaches in the
Church, and heart-burning one againſt another. No, Chriſt hath never pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed
ſo much liberty for every man to do what he liſt in things apparently
unlawfull againſt the common principles of Religion, In thoſe there may be
compulſion. But that liberty that Chriſt hath purchaſed, is the lawful uſe of
the things of indifferency, and the lawfull uſe of his ordinances. And though
now men think that even in ſuch things that are in themſelves indifferent, if
men be left at their liberty, there will be ſuch heart-burning, &amp; ſuch diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and no peace at all in the Church; they are much miſtaken in this, for
the onely way to have true peace in the Church, is to leave things as Chriſt
hath left them, &amp; to force nothing upon mens conſciences that Chriſt would
not have forced, this is the way of peace; and the ſpecial way of diſſention
(we have had experience of it) hath been and ever will be, the urging upon
mens conſciences thoſe things Chriſt would not have urged, this is it that
makes the greateſt rent &amp; diviſion in the Church.<note place="margin">Vrging things indif<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ferent the cauſe of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions in the Church</note> The urging of uniformity

there ſhall not be any ſuch neede of any Antichriſtian chaine, to chaine the

But ſuppoſe by their power they could have brought all to an uniformity,
in their own inventions and innovations as they deſired. What then? they
have little cauſe to brag of that unity neither. Certainly there the remedy
would have been worſe then the diſeaſe, and work a greater miſchief. Their
bragging then of unity would have been no other but thus, as if a couple of
priſoners chained to a block, and kept cloſe all day, ſhould ſee others goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
in the ſtreets at a diſtance, and they ſhould cry out to them, Why doe
you not take example by us? you keep at a diſtance one from another, doe
you not ſee that we keepe cloſe together from morning to night? pray take
example by us, and do not go ſo diſtant one from another. Would not ſuch
an argument be moſt ridiculous? What is the reaſon of their union but their
choine? Certainly there is the ſame argument in theſe mens pleading for that
uniformity that they force men to by ſuch a kinde of Antichriſtian chaine.</p>
               <p>What breach of unity is it if in a broad ſtreet one goes a little diſtant from
another? and ſo what breach is it if in matters of indifferency one take one
way and another another? It is the corrupt and perverſe ſpirits of men that
thinke they cannot have unity, and yet have things as Chriſt have left them.
Chriſt needs no ſuch things to cauſe unity in his Church, the ſpirit of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that ſhal love truth &amp; peace is enough to cauſe that unity he would have.
And O that this time that this gathering together were come, of all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
to be made one, &amp; be under one head! for abundance of miſchief is done
now among the Churches, and in the world by the ſpirit of diviſion and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſion.
The Devil delights (eſpecially that devil that is the ſpirit of diviſion)
to live in the region of the Church. There are ſome devils eſpecially that are
ſpirits of pride, (as the dumb devil) and ſome of diſſention, and ſome of one
kinde and ſome of another; and I remember <hi>Cajetan</hi> hath a note upon that
place of the Goſpel, where our Saviour Chriſt caſt the devils out of the <hi>poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed

                  <note place="margin">Mar. 5. 8. 9</note> they beſought him that he would let them <hi>enter into the ſwine,</hi> &amp;
that he would not <hi>ſend them out of that Region,</hi> becauſe (ſaith he) they have
ſeveral Regions where they moſt haunt, and they that are in ſuch a Region,
they are loath to be put out of it, but would faine keep their place. Whether
that be ſo or no we will not ſay, but this we ſay, that if their be any Religion
in the world that the unclean ſpirit of diviſion loveth to be in, and is loath to
be caſt out; it is the Region of the Church, for their he doth the greateſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe.
But Chriſt hath a time to caſt this unelean ſpirit out of the Region of
the Church, and that ſo, as hee never ſhall returne any more.</p>
               <p>This point in regard we meet with it ſo fitly, and is ſo fully agreeable to

Lord Jeſus, come quickely!</hi> Yet let us further obſerve the difference between
the ſcattering of the wicked, and the ſcattering of the Saints. Judah &amp; Iſrael
they were ſcattered, but, now they ſhall be gathered together.</p>
               <p>There is a great deale of difference between the ſcattering of the Saints,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> and
the ſcattering of the wicked: When God ſcatters the Saints, he ſcatters them
that they may be gathered; when he ſcatters the wicked, hee ſcatters them
that he may deſtroy them, <hi>Pſal. 68. 1. Let God ariſe, and let his enemies be
ſcattered:</hi> How ſcattered? <hi>As ſmoake is driven away; ſo drive them away.</hi>
Smoake you know is driven away and ſcattered, ſo as it comes to nothing.
<hi>Pſal. 144. 6. Caſt forth lightning and ſcatter them, ſhoote out thine Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes
and deſtroy them.</hi> This is the ſcattering of the wicked: but as for the
Saints, they may be ſcattered, but it is to ſpread abroad the goſpell by them
in the world. <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 4. The Text ſaith, <hi>They that were ſcattered abroad by
reaſon of the perſecution of Saul, went every where preaching the word:</hi> but
within a while our God ſhall come and all his Saints with him, and hee will
gather together the out-caſts of Iſrael, with abundance of mercy: ſo Micah.
46. <hi>In that day ſaith the Lord, I will gather her that is driven out &amp; her
that I have afflicted;</hi> and Eſay, 54. 7. <hi>For a time, for a ſmall moment have
I forſaken thee, but with great mercies I will gather thee.</hi> God will ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his people with great mercyes. God hath (my brethren) fulfilled this
in a great part, in our eyes even this day. Many of thoſe that were driven out
of their places and Countryes, thoſe that were afflicted, and thoſe the land
could not beare, God hath gathered together theſe out-caſts of Iſrael.</p>
               <p>Let every one take heed how he hinders this worke of the Lord, and how
he addeth affliction to thoſe that have been afflicted.</p>
               <p>Again further. <hi>They ſhall be gathered together in that day,</hi> That is, in the
time of the Goſpel, when that ſhall prevail then Judah and Iſrael ſhall be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered

they ſtirred not from their ſtooles, there was no noiſe among them;
ſhall the light be blamed becauſe afterward when it came, every one ſtirred,
and went, one, one way and another, another? ſo when we were in groſſe
darkneſſe, we ſaw nothing, we knew nothing; Now light begins to breake
forth, and here one ſearcheth after one truth, and another after another, and
yet we cannot attaine to perfection; ſhall we accuſe the light for this?</p>
               <p>Yea but we ſee too apparently that thoſe that ſeem the ſtricteſt of all, that
would worſhip God (as they ſay) in the pureſt manner in his Ordinances;
yet there are woefull diviſions and diſtractions even amongſt them. How
then is the Goſpel a Goſpel of peace? But a word in anſwer to this; To
ſatisfie your conſciences, that the Goſpel may not be blamed, for indeed
where the Goſpel comes, there is promiſed peace. Conſider this one reaſon
that may be given for it. Becauſe ſo long as we are here we are partly fleſh
and partly ſpirit. Yet thoſe that have the Goſpel prevaile with their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
they come to be of this temper, that they cannot move any further
then they can ſee light for, and their conſciences will give them leave.</p>
               <p>But now other men they have more liberty, they indeed quarrel not one
with another, why? becauſe they have wide, checker, lyther conſciences, &amp;
having ends of their owne they will yeeld to any thing for the attaining of
thoſe ends;<note place="margin">The reaſon why godly men are not ſo yeelding as others.</note> ſo that here they have this advantage, that if they ſee that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
will bring them more trouble then they conceive the thing is worth,
they will condeſcend though it be againſt light of conſcience. But other men
upon whom the light of the Goſpel hath prevailed have that bond upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
that though all the world ſhould differ from them, they muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to lye down and ſuffer, they cannot yeeld, though you would give them
all the world they cannot go againſt that light. But indeed they may ſearch,
and it may trouble them that their apprehenſions of things ſhould be differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
from the apprehenſions of their brethren, and that they cannot yeeld to
that which their brethren yeeld too. It is true, they ſhould be humbled, and
ſuſpect their hearts, and look to themſelves, and fall down before God and
pray, and uſe all means for advice and counſell, and conſider of things again
and again. Well, but ſuppoſe they have done all this, and yet the Lord doth
not reveale to them any further light, though it be a ſad affliction to them yet
they muſt lye down under it, for they cannot yeeld, one known truth is more
then all the world, therefore unleſſe others will beare with them in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity,
they muſt ſuffer whatſoever men will lay upon them.</p>
               <p>True indeed, the world calls this ſtoutneſs, and ſtifneſſe, and being wedded
to their own opinion. But they know it is otherwiſe, they can appeal to God

one is, of the more joyning &amp; uniting nature he is. Thouſands of beames of
the Sun will meet together in one better then the beams of a candle will doe.
The Saints of God in the Apoſtles times when they were converted, it is ſaid,
<hi>they were added to the Church,</hi> they gathered preſently. So in <hi>Eſay.</hi> 66. (it is
an obſervable place) <hi>ver.</hi> 20. the Text ſaith, <hi>They ſhall bring their brethren
as an offering to the Lord out of all Nations, upon horſes, and in chariots, &amp;.
in litters.</hi> How comes this? There ſhall be many that dwell a great way off.
they ſhall not make that their excuſe for their not joyning to the people of
God, becauſe they are afar off, It is a great journey; No, but there be horſes
to be got: But it may be ſome cannot ride? Then get Charets: But ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
are ſo weake that they can neither ride on horſes nor in Chariots, then
they will get litters, and litters you know are to carry weake &amp; ſick perſons.
This ſhews the intention of ſpirit that is in the people of God to be gathered
to the Church, either to be carryed on horſes, or in Chariots, or in litters, one
way or other they will come and joyn themſelves to the people of God. For
there is the preſence of Chriſt, and the protection of Chriſt, and the comuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of Chriſt in their union and communion, and <hi>where the carcaſſe is,
there will the Eagles reſort.</hi> O they love alife to be going towards Sion, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
one to another, as in <hi>Pſal. 84. 7. They walk from ſtrength to ſtrength,
and at laſt they all appear before God in Zion.</hi> From ſtrength to ſtrength, that
is thus: From one place of the Country perhaps there comes halfe a ſcore, or

that is a ſufficient argument of truth. A multitude coming under one
Head, under Chriſt as one Head, they are the true Church. The Papiſts they

And who doth ſhe ſit upon? upon peoples and multitudes. It is not an
argument then of a true Church though they are multitudes, though they be

they ſhall be joyned together in one way, with one conſent; yea but if it be

                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Rom the tenth verſe to the end, you have heard that God
promiſeth mercy to an Iſrael that he will in time raiſe up:
although for that Iſrael to whom the Prophet ſpake, they
ſhall go into captivity and ſhall not returne as Judah did.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Mercy to Iſrael and Judah both together, and
that firſt, In the multitude that ſhall be gathered, ſecondly,
In the excellency of the ſtate of the Church at that time above that which
was before; before they were <hi>People,</hi> but then they ſhall be <hi>Sons:</hi> Thirdly,
In the unity of them, Iſrael and Judah ſhall be both gathered together under
one head. Some time was ſpent in the laſt exerciſe about unity, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of the unity of the Churches; wherein we laboured to convince
you that uniformity in judgement, and practice is not neceſſary for unity in
the Churches, for unity of hearts. It is a falſe principle that runnes in the world,
that all men muſt needs be brought to believe and doe the ſame thing or elſe
there can be no peace. If we would have light let in to us, we muſt ſo priſe
it as to be willing that in the diſcuſſion of truths there ſhould be ſome hazard
of ſome differences in leſſer things. If a man have a houſe cloſed on every
ſide with a thick brick-wall, and he is ſo deſirous to keepe his houſe ſafe and
ſtronge, that he will rather all his dayes ſit in the darke, then be at the trouble
to have a hole digged or a few bricks broken to let in any light, wee would
accuſe that man of folly. It is true indeed, we muſt not be ſo deſirous of light
as to break ſo much of the wall as to indanger the houſe, we muſt keepe that
ſafe; but yet it is hard to let in light but there will be ſome bricks taken away,
and there muſt be ſome trouble. A childe when he ſees the work-man with
his tooles breaking the wall and making a deale of rubbiſh, hee thinks he is
pulling down the houſe, but a wiſe man knows it is but a little trouble for the
preſent to let in light that ſhall be for the beauty of the houſe afterward.</p>
               <p>Unity in the Churches is lovely. But it muſt be under one head.</p>
               <p>They ſhal be gathered together and appoint themſelves one head.</p>
               <p>Agreement in errour is farre worſe then diviſion for the ſake of truth. Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to be divided from men that are erroneous, then to agree with them in the
wayes of their arrour. A company gathered without the covenant of peace,
without the obſervance of Gods law is a headleſſe multitude, ſaies <hi>Bernard,</hi>
it hath much of Babylon, but little of Jeruſalem.</p>
               <p>What is this <hi>Head?</hi>

returne out of the land: there it was Judah and not the ten Tribes that were
delivered from their captivity. Secondly, Compare this Scripture with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that are but a Comment upon it, and we ſhall finde that <hi>Zerubbabel</hi>
cannot be meant, <hi>Ezeck.</hi> 34, and 37. (you may reade the Chapters at your
leaſure) In thoſe Chapters wee have expreſſions ſuch as plainly appeares
they are but Comments to this Text of <hi>Hoſea</hi> (for <hi>Ezekiel</hi> propheſied af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Hoſea</hi> did:) and eſpecially in the 37. <hi>Chap.</hi> we have a propheſie of the
union of all the Tribes together, Judah and Iſrael, and <hi>ver. 24. David my
ſervant ſhall be King over them,</hi> and <hi>ver. 25. My ſervant David ſhall be
their Prince for ever.</hi> That one head that they ſhall have when they
come together ſhall be <hi>David.</hi> And ſo in <hi>Chap. 34. ver. 23. I will
ſet one ſhepheard over them, and he ſhall feed them, even my ſervant
David:</hi> and <hi>ver. 24, I the Lord will be their God and my ſervant David,</hi>
not <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> Now by <hi>David</hi> we are to underſtand <hi>Chriſt</hi> cleerly, for ſo
in other palaces, as <hi>Eſay, 55. 3. I will give unto you the ſure mercies of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
they can onely be meant of the ſure mercies of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſo it is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
by S. <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 13. 34. Therefore then we conclude certainly this
is meant of <hi>Chriſt;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bern. Ser 5. de ded c. Eccles.</note> and they ſhall appoint <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be their Head.</p>
               <p>This is then the firſt great point that we have in this Text, a head-point of
Divinity indeed, that JESUS CHRIST, is the head of the Church.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly,<note place="margin">1. 2.</note> he ſhall be ſo <hi>appointed.</hi> We ſhall ſhew you what the

cannot be contemptible that hath a Head ſo honourable. It is he that is

The head of every man, how? What are all men in the world the body
of Chriſt? if he be the head, then it ſeemes they are all the members.</p>
               <p>No, though Chriſt be the head of Angels,<note place="margin">2. How Chriſt the Head of every man.</note> yet Angels are not ſaid to be
members of him, yea in the ſame place of the <hi>Corinths,</hi> God is ſaid to be the
<hi>Head of Chriſt,</hi> and yet Chriſt is not a member of God. So that he may be
the head of every man, and yet every man not a member of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The head of every man in regard of that ſuperiority that Chriſt hath over
every man, and ſome kinde of influence even from Chriſt commeth to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. How Chriſt the Head of all things.</note> Yea, hee that is the head of his people, of his Church, is the
head of al things. <hi>Ephe. 1. 22. God hath given him to be head of all things
to the Church.</hi> Mark it, it is a moſt admirable place, that <hi>Chriſt is the head
of all things.</hi> But how? <hi>To the Church,</hi> for the ſake of the Church, as aym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the good of the Church eſpecially. Sure it is the honour of the Church
to have ſuch a head, that is thus the brighteneſſe of his Fathers glory, the head
of Angels,<note place="margin">2, The ſtrength of the Church in Chriſt their Head</note> the head of every man, the head of all things for the good of his
Church. And as their honour conſiſteth in it, ſo ſecondly it is their ſtrength.</p>
               <p>Chriſt is the head of the Church in regard of the ſtrength that the Church
hath by him. An oppreſſed multitude cannot help it ſelfe if they have no
head, but if God ſhall pleaſe to give them ſtrength and a head, and that in a
legall way, if they have hearts they may deliver themſelves from oppreſſion,
this God hath done for us; if therefore God doth not vote us to miſery and
ſlavery, if we be not a people given up of God to ruine, we may have help.</p>
               <p>The Church is a communion of Saints oppreſſed here in the world, their
ſtrength is in heaven, it is in their Head, that hath received all power to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
for them, in him is their ſtrength, to him do they cleave, for him they
bleſſe God even the Father, becauſe he is their ſtrength.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, He is their head becauſe the Saints do hold all upon Chriſt, all that
they have they hold <hi>in Capite,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3. The Church holds all on Chriſt.</note> as the beſt tenure of all, the Tenure upon which
the Saints hold all their comfort all their good in this world, it is in another
way then other men hold it: other men have what they have through the
bounty and patience of God; but the Saints hold all <hi>in Capite,</hi> in their head,
in Chriſt, in the right they have in him.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. <hi>Safety in Chriſt.</hi> Lutherus apud illus Satan eſt, ſed Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us regnat &amp; vivat.</note> Their head, becauſe their ſafety is in him: though the Church,
all the members be under water, yet all is ſafe when the head is above water,
our head is in Heaven. It is a ſpeech of <hi>Luthers;</hi> He ſaith he was even as a
Devil to them they did ſo accuſe him, but let Chriſt live and raign, Chriſt is
above, the head is above water.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Their head in regard of his compaſſion to his Church and people.</p>
               <p>The meaneſt member here below, if wronged, Chriſt is ſenſible of it.</p>
               <p>When but the toe is trodden upon,<note place="margin">5. Chriſt the Head hath compasſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the members.</note> the head cryes why doe you hurt me?
Chriſt the head cryes, <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi> And obſerve,
the meaner and poorer the Members of Chriſt are here in the Church, the
more is Chriſt ſenſible of their ſorrowes and afflictions, and the more will
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:42662:56"/>
he appeare for them, when he ſhall appear a head yet more gloriouſly then
ever he hath done. For this that forenamed place <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34. from the 16. <hi>ver</hi>
to the 26. is very notable. You ſhall finde there Chriſt is ſaid to be <hi>one ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard</hi>
to his people and <hi>a Prince</hi> to them; but mark what is promiſed, <hi>That
he will binde up the broken, and bring back again that which was driven
away, and ſtrengthen that which was ſick, but as for the fat of the flock and
the ſtrong he well deſtroy them, and feed them with judgement; and he will
judge between cattell and cattell, between the rams and the hee-goats, he
will judge between the fat and the leane cattell; he will judge thoſe that
thruſt with ſide &amp; with ſhoulder, and puſh at the diſeaſed with their horns,
untill they have ſcattered the ſheep abroad.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When Chriſt ſhall appeare, he will not ſhew ſuch reſpect to the jolly ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of thoſe that were in the Church, to your brave, ſtout, jolly hearts, that
would carry all before them with force; No, he will looke to the poor of the
flocke, and thoſe that thruſt with the ſide, and puſhed with the hornes, and
ſcattered the poor, and the leane; they ſhall be judged.</p>
               <p>My brethren, have you not known times when ſtout-hearted and cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted
men have thruſt with the ſide, and puſhed with the horne, and ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered

conſcioned Chriſtians? VVell, but here is a promiſe, that Chriſt our

affection toward the poor afflicted of the flocke, he ſhall take away from
the land the evill beaſts, as you have it there in the 25. <hi>verſ.</hi> He is the head
in regard of his compaſſion.</p>
               <p>Sixthly,<note place="margin">6. Chriſt the Head in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of Guidance.</note> Chriſt is their head in regard of guidance and direction. The bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

muſt hold on Chriſt; they hold on Chriſt <hi>in Capite, Coloſ.</hi> 2. 19. The
Apoſtle rebuking worſhipping of Angels and other falſe opinions, he ſaith,
<hi>that they did not hold of the head;</hi> All Doctrines in the Church therefore
muſt hold of the head, and muſt not be obtruded upon the Church, but as
they come from the head and hold there.</p>
               <p>Seventhly,<note place="margin">7. Chriſt the Head in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his Rule.</note> And that principally, and which we muſt ſtick upon a while,
which is intended here in the Text moſt of all. Chriſt is the head in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of his rule, in regard of his government; and therefore he that is called
<hi>one head</hi> here is called <hi>a Prince</hi> in thoſe two forenamed <hi>Chapters, Ezek</hi> 34
and 37. It would ſpend time needleſly to ſhew you in Scripture how Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
are called <hi>heads,</hi> that I ſuppoſe you are all acquainted with.</p>
               <p>This therefore is the maine thing that we are now to open unto you, how
Chriſt is the head of the Church in regard of his rule and government.</p>
               <p>There are many things of concernment in this point.<note place="margin">4. Things in church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of Chriſt.</note> I ſhall deſire to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline

Firſt, All Offices and Officers in the Church hold upon Chriſt and are
from him as from the head.<note place="margin">1. All offices hold on chriſt the Head</note> As (you know) it is in a civill body, the Offices
of a civill State holds of the King; holds upon him in a legall way, the power
of the King being regular, it regulateth all power in all other Officers; that
which is done, is done (you know) in the name of the King. So all the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
&amp; Offices in the Church, are in the name of Chriſt, they all hold on him.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Three dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tween civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> That there can be no officer nor offices in the Church, but ſuch as
Chriſt himſelfe hath appointed, for they muſt hold of him, they muſt be by
inſtitution. I beſeech you obſerve the difference between Officers in a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
State, and Officers in a Church. A Civill State becauſe it directly rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
but to the outward man, hath liberty to appoint what officers it pleaſe
according to the rules of prudence and juſtice; to appoint more or leſſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the neceſſity of the Country &amp; place.<note place="margin">1.</note> But it is not ſo in the Church,
there we have no liberty to goe according to the rules of prudence meerly, to
erect any office, becauſe we think it may make for the good and peace of the
Church; I ſay, therefore to erect any new office that is not erected before
in the Word, we have not that liberty, we cannot do it, we are too bold if
we ſhall do it, for ſuch an office will not <hi>hold of the Head.</hi> In the State
none can erect new Offices; new Courts, but the ſupreame power, the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame
Legiſlative power; So in the Church, none can erect new Offices,
but onely from the Head. In the Civill State God leaveth a great deale of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty;
there may be change of Officers, thoſe that are good now, perhaps
they may ſeem not to be ſo fit afterwards, and thoſe that are in one Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
may not be ſo fit for another. But the Officers of the Church they muſt
be all the ſame in all places, where they can be had, and no more but thoſe
that are appointed by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Again, further, the difference between the Civill State and Church State
in their Offices and Officers is this:<note place="margin">2.</note> The Civill State may limit their officers
as they think fit. They may chooſe one into an office, but he ſhall goe but ſo
far, he ſhall have power but in ſo many things, this ſhall be the object of his
power, when he is come hither, there he ſhall ſtop, though he that was before
him had more power, yet he that comes after him may not have that power,
the Civill State may limit that, if they ſee it fit. But now in the Church State
it cannot be ſo. And upon this ground, becauſe they hold upon the Head.</p>
               <p>Indeed the men that beare any office in the Church, are deſigned unto it by
the Church, but they doe not hold of the Church, they hold of Chriſt the
Head, therefore it is not in the power of the Church to limit them being in it,
but they muſt go to the Word, for their office once taken upon them, (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be the office of Teachers or of Paſtors) they cannot then be limited
by any power, but what the Word ſaith is the office of a Teacher or of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor,
that they muſt doe; they cannot have the rule ſo propounded to them,
as, You ſhall go but thus far, and you ſhall do ſo much of the office of a Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
and no more, but when they are once <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> they are in without any limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the power of their office: it is onely from Chriſt the Head.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:42662:57"/>
Yea further, In a civill State there may be alteration, raiſing the dignity
of the office,<note place="margin">3.</note> and making of it lower then before; but in the Church no ſuch
thing, the officers of the Church are alwayes the ſame, no raiſing, no depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
why? becauſe they hold upon the Head. Others depend upon mans
prudence, but theſe are inſtitutions by Chriſt, and hold of the Head.</p>
               <p>2.<note place="margin">2. All Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances hold to Chriſt the Head.</note> Chriſt is the Head in regard of rule, becauſe all Ordinances hold on
Chriſt too, and all Lawes. I will put both together, Ordinances and Laws,
and Inſtitutions do hold upon Chriſt the Head. It is not in the liberty of
man to erect any new ſpirituall Ordinance in the Church, no nor to make
Laws in the Church that are ſpiritual, that ſhall tend to the ſpirits of men,
(according as I ſhall open it by and by.) No new Ordinance, no new In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
can be in the Church. In the civil State there may be thouſands of
new Inſtitutions.<note place="margin">What the nature of an Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is.</note> I call that an Inſtitution that hath an efficacy in it for the
attaining of ſuch an end by vertue of the Inſtitution, not by vertue of any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalneſſe
that is in the thing. As for example to inſtance in Divine Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
The Sacrament is an Inſtitution, and therefore is a virtue, a ſpirituall
efficacy to be expected from that and by that, through the ſtrength of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
more then it hath in it in any naturall way. So in preaching the
Word, and Eccleſiaſtical cenſures, there is more to be expected, more effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
to worke upon the ſoule, for the ſpiritual man, by virtue of the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
then there is in the natural things that are done there.</p>
               <p>So for Lawes. Chriſt makes a law in the Church, it being an inſtitution
there is to be expected a ſpiritual efficacy and virtue to goe along together,
with that thing that Chriſt commandeth, beyond what it had before it was
commanded. Now then in rhis way no man in the world can make any
Church inſtitution, no, nor Law for the Church, ſo as to appoint any thing,
to have any ſpirituall efficacy by vertue of that inſtitution beyond what it
hath in a natural way. We muſt take heed of being ſo bold, that when Chriſt
hath made an inſtitution, an ordinance, and revealed it to us, for us to think
we may imitate Chriſt and make another Ordinance, or another inſtitution
like that, becauſe Chriſt hath done ſo, becauſe we finde ſuch a thing in the
Word therefore we may do ſo too; No, this is too bold, this is <hi>to ſet our poſt
by Gods poſt,</hi> for which the Lord did charge the people, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43. 8. In <hi>Eſay</hi>
33. 22. it is ſaid, <hi>The Lord is our Judge, the Lord is our Law-giver, the
Lord is our King</hi> in this thing. But yet you will ſay, how is that opened fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
(for indeed it needeth opening) that there can be no new inſtitution,
nor no new Law made in this ſenſe, but all muſt hold of Chriſt?</p>
               <p>For the opening of that I ſhall afterward come to ſpeake more fully about
the power of Governours and what their authority is, but thus much for the
preſent.<note place="margin">No man can make any new Inſtitution in the Church.</note> VVe are to conſider that there are ſome things belonging to the

                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> may order things. Thoſe things I ſay that belong to the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:42662:57"/>
Church, that yet are not ſo proper, but belong to other ſocieties too, there
mans reaſon may come in. As for inſtance.</p>
               <p>Firſt, A Church is a ſpiritual ſociety and community, they muſt meete
together, and if they do meet they muſt meet in ſome place: This is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to all ſocieties in the world, if they will meet they muſt meet in a
place. Yea Secondly, if they meet in a place; this place muſt be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
where it ſhall be. This alſo is common to all ſocieties.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This likewiſe is common to them with all other ſocieties, that
what they do in that place muſt be done decently &amp; in order, all things ought
to be managed in an orderly decent way. As if there be many things to be
done, one thing muſt be before another, one thing muſt not exclude another;
if they come together, they muſt come together as befitting men in a decent
way. Therefore that rule of the Apoſtle, <hi>Let all things be done decently and
in order,</hi> it is not properly an inſtitution, it is nothing but the dictate of right
reaſon, ſo that if we had never found ſuch a ſentence, ſuch a maxime in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as <hi>let all things be done decently and in order,</hi> it had beene a truth that
we were bound in conſcience to.</p>
               <p>Again, If men will come and meet together, it is natural and common to
all ſocieties, that they ſhould be decent in their garments and otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>But then you will ſay, When commeth it to an Inſtitution? I meane an
Inſtitution that is forbidden, that none muſt meddle withall, that is proper
to Chriſt.<note place="margin">VVhat makes an inſtitution ſo as if man preſume to do it, it is unlawfull.</note> Thus, when any man ſhall by virtue of any Law, any impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
put more into the thing then God, or then nature hath put into it,
when they ſhall make their inſtitution to put any efficacy into it for the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of God more then God hath, this we call ſinfull. As for inſtance</p>
               <p>Suppoſe we ſhould inſtance onely in garments. That all that meetes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in Chriſtian Aſſemblies, ſhould meet decently in decent garments,
Miniſters and others,<note place="margin">1.</note> the light of nature tells us, and there may be law if men
will be refractory to compell them unto it, to meet ſo as they may meet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently
in regard of their garments. But now if it come thus far, that we leave
natural decency, and ſuch or ſuch a garment ſhall be made decent for Gods
worſhip becauſe it is appointed, whereas if it were not appointed it would
not be decent at all. When I ſay all the decency doth not depend upon what
God hath put into it, or what is natural to it, but depends meerly upon the
inſtitution of man, for take away that inſtitution it would not be decent; as
in ſome kinde of garments, put caſe men were left to their freedome, that
there were no inſtitution, I put it to your Conſciences whether it would be
decent to weare them: If it would not be decent, then it ſeems it is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
that puts all upon it; and now here we muſt take heed. This then
puts more upon that creature then nature or the God of nature hath put upon
it, then in way of common prudence (I ſay were it not for an inſtitution, that
ſeemes to go further, that ſeemes to intrench upon an ordinance) would be
done.<note place="margin">2.</note> Further, There is more put upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> then nature hath put into it,
when there ſhall be expected by vertue of an inſtitution, ſome kinde of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:42662:58"/>
efficacy to worke upon the ſoul, then it comes to be ſinfull. As thu
when that creature by virtue of the inſtitution, and appointment ſhall be
made, and eſteemed, or accounted of more effectual to ſtirre up my mind,
or to ſignifie ſuch a thing, as purity or holyneſſe, then another creature that
hath as much in it naturally to ſignifie the ſame thing, and to ſtirre up my
minde; this is to imitate Gods inſtitution, which is too much boldneſſe in
any man. As, when God doth appoint a thing in his Church, a Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
or the like, he will take ſome thing that hath a reſemblance to put men in
minde of ſuch a holy thing, that hath ſome kinde of Metaphor or likeneſſe
in it. But when God hath taken this creature and ſeparated it from others,
this creature muſt be expected to have more efficacy to ſignifie the thing to
my ſoul, and to ſtiree up my ſoul to think of his holineſſe, then any creature
in the world not ſo appointed, though other creatures have as much in them
naturally to do it. This is Gods inſtitution. Now mans inſtitution, that
cometh neere to Gods, where there is a ſetting our poſt by his poſt, is when
man ſhal take one creature from thouſands of others, and all thoſe thouſands
have as much in them naturally, and put into them by God, to put me in
minde of holyneſſe, and to ſtirre up my heart; now this creature ſhall be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from the reſt, and by virtue of an inſtitution put upon it, there ſhall
be expected more efficacy in this to ſtir up my mind, and to draw my heart
nearer to God then other creatures that onely do it in a natural way, here I
ſay is intrenching upon that which belongeth to the government of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Therefore I beſeech you my brethren be not miſtaken in this, becauſe I
know you are ordinarily led by that ſpeech of the Apoſtle, <hi>let all thinge be,
done decently and in order.</hi> Underſtand it aright, It is true we muſt do ſo
and it is a ſin, not to do things decently and in order, in the worſhip of God:
but this doth not at all countenance any inſtitution of mans when it comes to
be ſpiritual, to draw the heart nearer unto God, or God nearer unto the
heart, by virtue of mans ſeparation of it from common uſe.</p>
               <p>I might inſtance in other things, in places, That there ſhould be a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
place for Gods worſhip, the light of nature will tell us: but when any
man ſhall ſet one place aſide ſeparated from another, and ſhall make the
worſhip of God to be better, and have more efficacy to draw men nearer
unto God, or God nearer unto men, then another place that hath as much
natural decency and fitneſs in it as that place hath; here it commeth to have
the evil.<note place="margin">2. VVhat comes from Chriſt the head, binds conſcience in another manner then mans laws can doe.</note> By theſe few inſtances you may judge of all things, when they do
come to be inſtitutions in Gods worſhip, and beyond the rule of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
<hi>Let all things be done decently and in order,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the ſecond thing of Chriſts government, that all Ordinances, all
Lawes in the Church muſt hold on him the Head.</p>
               <p>The third thing in Chriſts government in the Church is, that thoſe Laws
that he makes for the ordering and government of his Church, do not onely
hold on him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſuch a virtue and efficacy in them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
from the head, that they do binde the conſciences of men, becauſe they
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:42662:58"/>
come from him that is the head of the Church, they do lay bonds upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,
and that primarily in another way, and more efficaciouſly then any
law of any man in the world can. Yea they lay ſuch a bond upon conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that though a thing be commanded that hath no other reaſon for the
command but meerly the will of Chriſt, and that we cannot ſee to what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
good the thing doth tend, but meerly becauſe Chriſt will have it, yet we
are bound to obey, yea and that in ſecret; Yea ſo farre as the rule goeth, wee
are bound to do what is required by it, though wee ſhould ſuffer never ſo
much prejudice to our ſelves. Here is the binding power of Chriſt in bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
conſcience. But there is no law of man doth in this way bind conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
perhaps theſe things, with ſome others that are to be delivered may at
the firſt naming of them ſeeme to be ſomewhat tickle points: yet I know
there is a neceſſity, and a kinde of abſolute neceſſity to informe the conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of men in them, eſpecially in theſe times, and becauſe they fall ſo full here
in my way I could not out of conſcience omit them: and yet ſtill if you dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
obſerve, I hope we ſhall carry on all ſo as to ſpeake modeſtly and yet
ſafely and fully too. I ſay therefore, the lawes of men are different from the
Lawes of Chriſt. It is a part of the head-ſhip of Chriſt to lay bonds upon
the conſcience. But what will you ſay then to that Text of Scripture (I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
it is in every one of your thoughts, and would be ready in every one of
your mouthes if you were from the Aſſembly) <hi>Rom. 13. Let every ſoul be
ſubject to the higher powers; for there is no power but of God. Whoſoever
reſiſteth the power, reſiſteth the ordinance of God, and they that reſiſt, ſhall
receive to themſelves damnation.</hi> Yea <hi>ver. 5. You muſt be ſubject not out of
feare of wrath, but for conſcience ſake.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Anſwer to that place. Rom. 13. brought to prove hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane laws to binde conſcience.</note> This Text ſeemes to imply that the
lawes of men do binde the conſcience; And we finde it by experience how
this is urged by many upon every thing, there is no kinde of inſtitution of
man whatſoever (except we can apparently ſhew, it is contrary to the word
of God) but they thinke by virtue of this Text the conſciences of men are
bound; and ſo they flie upon men, that they are not men of conſcience, that
they will not obey authority. In that they doe not ſubmit to authority, they
ſin againſt their conſciences, &amp;c. You ſhall have many men that will jeere
at thoſe that are ſo conſcionable in Gods commands that ſeeme to be but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
things (and in themſelves are little things) oh they dare not diſobey be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are bound in conſcience, they will jeere at the ſcrupuloſity of
their conſciences there. But when it comes to mans commands, then they
muſt obey in the leaſt thing whatever it be, though in its own nature it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo indifferent; yet they muſt obey for conſcience ſake.</p>
               <p>I ſhall deſire as fully and as cleerly as I am able, to ſatisfie Conſciences in
this very thing. To open therefore that Scripture unto you.</p>
               <p>Firſt, you muſt obſerve, that every one is bound to <hi>be ſubject to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
powers:</hi> (Mark) It is not to the <hi>Man</hi> firſt, but it is to the <hi>Power: Let
every ſoule be ſubject to the higher power,</hi> where ever this power lyeth.</p>
               <p>It is not to the will of a man that hath power, but it is to the power of that
man.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:42662:59"/>
Now the power, the authority is that, that man hath in a legall way. The
firſt muſt be underſtood.</p>
               <p>Secondly, We muſt conſider in what they muſt be ſubject: The laws
of men are of three ſorts. Some perhaps command that which is ſimply
unlawfull, that we all yeeld the Scripture doth not binde us to be ſubject,
there <hi>we muſt obey God rather then man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſecondly, there are other things that are commanded, that are lawfull,
and they are of two ſorts. Either ſuch things as do tend by the rules of juſtice
and prudence to the publique good, to the good of the Community of which
we are members: and there we are bound to obey for Conſcience ſake.</p>
               <p>But ſtill this not according to that obedience we owe to Chriſt our Head,
this is ſecondarily, not primarily, becauſe commanded by man, but becauſe
the rules of Juſtice and Prudence doth require this for the publique good, of
which we are a community; and then becauſe there commeth a Law of
Chriſt to us to walk and live according to the rules of Juſtice and prudence:
ſo wee are bound for conſcience in thoſe things, but not primarily, and ſo
they cannot be ſaid to bind conſcience, ſo as Chriſts Lawes do.</p>
               <p>There are other things that are commanded by man (and that eſpecially
concerns our queſtion) and theſe are ſuch things as indeed are neither here
nor there for the common, for the publique good, the good of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
doth not at all depend upon them, and there is nothing in them but
meerly the ſatisfaction of the wills of thoſe that are in authority above us.</p>
               <p>Now here is the Queſtion, How far thoſe Laws bind men, and bind Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience?
Indeed many poor Chriſtians that are conſcientious have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
ſnared in theſe things.</p>
               <p>To that I anſwer: That though ſuch things ſhould be commanded to be
done, yet it they be not done.) ſo be it they be not omitted out of contempt,
nor ſo as may bring ſcandall upon the authority that doth enjoyne them;
and thoſe that doe omit them ſhall patiently and willingly ſubmit to what
puniſhment the Law of the Land ſhall require) in ſuch things this mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
ſhall not, nor need not bind him over to anſwer before God, that he
hath ſinned againſt that rule, You will ſay, How do you prove that? How
doth it appeare? For that muſt needs be made out.</p>
               <p>I vvill make it appeare from the Text, from the nature of ſubjection that is
required in the Text, and from Reaſon.</p>
               <p>Firſt, this Text here in <hi>Rom,</hi> 13. giveth this as the ground why we are to
be ſubject, <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſaith the Text, <hi>ver.</hi> 4.) <hi>he is the miniſter of God for
thy good.</hi> So that that which is the ſpeciall ground of our ſubjection, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they that are in place are miniſters for our good. But here is then an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe
of their power, if they will command what is not indeed tending to the
good of the publique, but meerly the ſatisfaction of their own mindes.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe it be an abuſe, the Text ſaith we muſt be ſubject.</p>

though this authority ſhould be abuſed, yet I may not reſiſt, I muſt
be ſubject. If then out of that reverent reſpect I have to authority, though I
do not doe the thing,<note place="margin">1.</note> yet I doe not forbeare out of contempt: It is a thing
exceedingly prejudiciall unto me, and it is not for the common good, but yet
I am ſo carefull that authority ſhal not be deſpiſed that I will keep it ſecret.<note place="margin">2, 3.</note> I
will not refuſe to do it, ſo as ſhall be aſcandall upon authority.</p>
               <p>And yet further, if authority ſhall ſo far urge upon me as to inflict puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
becauſe I do not do it, I will patiently beare it. Now when theſe three
things are done, here is that ſubordination to authority that the Apoſtle in
that Scripture requires. And the reaſon why this of neceſſity muſt be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
is, becauſe otherwiſe all the Chriſtian liberty that the Scripture ſo much
ſpeakes of, may be utterly taken away in regard of the practice, that it is in
the power of man wholly to deprive us of it.</p>
               <p>This Scripture cannot be ſo underſtood, that all that liberty we have in all
things in their own nature indifferent ſhould be ſo under the power of men,
as that we for the practice, and for our conſcience too muſt be tyed that we
cannot have liberty, no not in ſecret, certainly that is that which is againſt
the judgement of all Orthodox Divines of the Reformed Churches.</p>
               <p>But it may be ſaid, who ſhall be Judge whether things be tending to the
publicke good yea or no?<note place="margin">Every one muſt judge of his owne act, but yet at a two fold peril.</note> will you take upon you to judge your ſelf?</p>
               <p>To that the Anſwer is thus plainly, that indeed thoſe that are appointed by
Law have the power to judge legally, and authoritatively to judge ſo as to

againſt the Lord, againſt the rules of juſtice and prudence, and indan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gereth
his own ſoul if he goe amiſſe in this.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2.</note> If he miſ-judge it is at his perill that comes by the Lawes of
men, that he is in danger then to ſuffer what the Laws of men ſhall inflict u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
him: And ſo ſubmitting this way, his conſcience may have ſome eaſe;
and yet no gap open at all to liberty, or any diſturbance to any lawfull
authority for all this. This is neceſſary for men to know that they may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand<note place="margin">3.</note>
aright how to anſwer that queſtion about Lawes binding of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.
You heare it is the prerogative of Chriſt our Head, ſo to be our
Law-giver, ſo as to lay bonds upon conſcience in ſuch a manner as no man
can doe the like. That is the third.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4.</note> Chriſt is the Head of the Church (in regard of ſome) even per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally,
ſo as to come and rule in the world in a glorious manner perſonally,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:42662:60"/>
and ſo they thinke this may be interpreted, that Chriſt ſhall be a head (how
ſaid to be appointed, we ſhall ſpeake of when we come unto it) that he ſhall
come perſonally, and rule and governe things even in this world.</p>
               <p>As Chriſt in his own perſon did exerciſe his Prieſtly and Propheticall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
ſo they thinke in his own perſon he ſhall exerciſe his Kingly power &amp;
office. Which opinion, becauſe the further diſcuſſion of it, I ſuppoſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
you are not able to beare yet, therefore in modeſty I will forbeare, and
though out of modeſty I ſhal for the preſent forbeare, yet out of conſcience
I dare not altogether deny it, but ſo we will leave it, to ſee what trueth may
be in this, we muſt expect to have light let in by degrees.</p>
               <p>In theſe four things then we have the rule of Chriſt, three determined of,
the fourth only propounded, which Chriſt in time will ſhew further light un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us in. Chriſt is then the Head.</p>
               <p>Now from all this there followes three conſequences that are very uſefull.</p>
               <p>1. Hence we learne that the ſeeking after the right government of Chriſt
in his Church is not a light matter, it doth concern the Head-ſhip of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>2.<note place="margin">Not a light matter to ſeek after the right govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt.</note> By what hath been ſaid we ſhal come to be inſtructed to know what is
properly Antichriſtian and what not.</p>
               <p>3. Wee ſhall come to have light how far the King may be ſaid to be head
of the Church. Theſe things you will finde needfull for conſcience to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
in, &amp; I ſhal carry them on too I hope with modeſty, fulneſs, &amp; ſafety,</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Quae pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricula ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiam exceptura ſunt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put agnoſ centem tempora noſtra ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d unt, quia Chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtum to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicauius caput noſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum Ana themati &amp; omnis generis ſuppliciit ſubſecici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur,</note> I ſay it followes from hence that it is not a light matter to ſeeke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the right government of Chriſt in his Church, it concerns a head-ſhip of
Chriſt. The head-ſhip of Chriſt in a ſpeciall manner conſiſteth in that there
are ſome other things in which it doth conſiſt, which perhaps may be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of hereafter, but here in this place eſpecially that.</p>
               <p>Indeed in the primitive times there the greateſt contention was about the
Doctrines of Religion, what Doctrines ſhould hold upon Chriſt and what
not, and the people of God did there ſuffer moſt for contending about the
doctrines that held upon Chriſt the Head, they would not receive a Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine
but what held on Chriſt, and what was obrtuded upon them, not hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon Chriſt the Head they did reject. And <hi>Luther</hi> upon this place hath
this ſpeech, he tells us how much the Church in after time did ſuffer for this
very thing, and ſaith, What kinde of dangers did inviron the Church, and
do inviron it for acknowledging Chriſt to be the head, theſe our times doe
ſufficiently teſtifie. And further, becauſe we preach Chriſt to be the whole
head, therefore we are ſubject to <hi>Anathemas,</hi> and to all kinde of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And in theſe latter times it is like that the great contention will be, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
about the head-ſhip of Chriſt in the point of his government then in the
other, the other being ſo cleare unto us; and the ſufferings of the people of
God will be ſo much the more grievous, becauſe that this is accounted ſuch
a little thing, ſuch a poor buſineſſe: And further, becauſe this doth not ſeem
to be altogether ſo clearely revealed in the Scripture, as other Doctrinall
points that hold upon Chriſt the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ead. And Chriſt the rather hath ſo diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:42662:60"/>
of things, that this ſhall not be ſo clearly revealed, becauſe he intended to
ſuffer Antichriſt to riſe to his height: and it cannot be imagined that if the
Doctrine of Chriſts government in his Church had beene clearly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtratively
laid down, ſo as there could have beene no gain-ſaying of it,
I ſay it cannot be imagined how it is poſſible for Antichriſt to have riſen to
that height that he hath; Chriſt becauſe hee intended to bring about many
paſſages of his providence, and many great workes of his that way in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
Antichriſt to ariſe; therefore he hath left this point ſo in the word as
is ſubject to many doubts, and may occaſion many objections againſt it.</p>
               <p>But the nearer the time comes for Antichriſt to fall, the more clearly this
ſhall be revealed.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2.</note> By this that hath beene ſaid we may learne what to account
Antichriſtianiſme, and what not: for there are many amongſt us that cry
out againſt every thing that diſpleaſeth them, that it is Antichriſtianiſme,
that it is Antichriſtianiſme, and yet underſtand but very little what Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtianiſme
is.</p>
               <p>But by this that hath beene ſaid,<note place="margin">What is to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſme, what not.</note> you muſt know that Antichriſtianiſme is
not every errour: It is true in a large ſenſe Antichriſt is as much as againſt
Chriſt, and ſo every ſin, every errour is againſt Chriſt, and in Antichriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſme,
if you take it ſo. But you are to know the Scripture ſpeakes of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt,
and of Antichriſtianiſme in a ſpeciall acceptation. What is that?</p>
               <p>This my brethren is Antichriſtianiſme, that which ſhall oppoſe Chriſt as
a Head, and ſet up another head-ſhip; here is the propriety of Antichriſt
and Antichriſtianiſme; as in all thoſe foure things named before.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1.</note> VVhoſoever ſhall obtrude any Doctrine upon the Church to be
believed, by their own authority, he is guilty of Antichriſtianiſme, not who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
ſhall preach or hold an error in the Church. But when any ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
to obtrude upon the Church, any Doctrine that holds upon humane
authority, to be urged upon the authority of thoſe that do impoſe it, this I ſay
is properly Antichriſtianiſme, for it doth oppoſe Chriſt in his head-ſhip.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2.</note> The intruſion of ſuch offices and officers in the Church as
meerly belonging to the ſpirituall man, ſuch as are properly Church offices,
that do not hold upon Chriſt the Head, but only hold upon them, this is An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtianiſme.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The impoſing of any Ordinance, any new inſtitutions that are,
as hath been opened,<note place="margin">3.</note> upon the Church, belongeth to Antichriſtianiſme.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4</note> The impoſing of lawes ſo to bind conſcience as the Lawes of
Chriſt do, here is Antichriſtianiſme.</p>
               <p>This is Antichriſtianiſme, and that not onely becauſe theſe things are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
againſt the head-ſhip of Chriſt, but becauſe theſe things doe ſet up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
head too; and ſo the word <hi>Antichriſt</hi> may ſignifie as well <hi>for one to
be in ſtead of Chriſt</hi> (for ſo <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:42662:61"/>
as head of the Church in ſtead of Chriſt, one that ſhall clayme unto
himſelfe that head-ſhip that is proper to Jeſus Chriſt, and not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
to any from Jeſus Chriſt. This is Antichriſtianiſme.</p>
               <p>Now the Apoſtle faith that there were many Antichriſts in his time, and
this myſtery of ungodlineſſe, of inquity did worke then; but now it comes
to grow to a height in that great Antichriſt of Rome, (for you know) in
theſe foure are the ſpeciall things wherein he is the Antichriſt; Becauſe hee
obtrudes Doctrines, Articles of Faith upon the Church by his owne autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
He makes all Offices of the Church to hold on him; And appointeth
Lawes, Ordinances and Inſtitutions likewiſe to hold on him; And claym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the binding of Conſciences, ſo as is proper to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And all thoſe that hold thus on Antichriſt, and are thus abettors of him in
theſe things, theſe are guilty of this greatſinne of Antichriſtianiſme.</p>
               <p>That for your right information about the ſin of Antichriſtianiſme.</p>
               <p>The third conſequence.<note place="margin">3</note> You ſay Chriſt is the Head, but you know the
<hi>King</hi> is called <hi>the Head of the Church,</hi> in what ſenſe are we to underſtand
that? Or how may we come to underſtand aright that Oath that is given,
of Supremacie.</p>
               <p>Theſe things (my brethren) are neceſſary for information of Conſcience,
and the burthen lyes upon us to make out theſe things as cleare to you as we
can, that you may go along with the more freedome of ſpirit and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in your way, and yet give every one their right too.</p>
               <p>You are to know that the Oath of Supremacy came into England thus:
In the time of Popery, the Pope claymed unto himſelfe the Head-ſhip of the
Church: He being excluded, then came in that Oath to acknowledge the
King or Queene the Head of the Church. But now you muſt know, firſt,
that this title, <hi>The Head of the Church,</hi> as it hath been attributed to the
King, hath been much abuſed, and it hath given ſome advantage to our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries,
for the King is not the Head of the Church, neither as Chriſt is,
nor as the Pope claymed it:</p>
               <p>Not as Chriſt: Chriſt is the Head to governe unlimitedly. No limits or
bounds are ſet to the Government of Chriſt, but only his owne minde, his
owne will. It is not ſo with any Prince in the world, he is not ſo the Head to
governe. But all Governours have a two-fold limit; They are limited by
Lawes of God, they are limited by the Lawes of man too.</p>
               <p>Neither is he the Head, as the Pope challengeth unto himſelfe, How is
that? you will ſay. In the fore-named foure things, the Pope challengeth
holding of doctrines, and holding of offices, and the like, upon him. Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
do not ſo hold upon any Governours, upon the King or others, as the
Pope challengeth to hold upon him. How doth he challenge them to hold
upon him? Thus, that all are in him virtually, and ſo to be derived from
him to others. And indeed in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> part do many of our Prelates ſay that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>: that is, that all the offices hold on
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o goe from them unto others:
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:42662:61"/>
and hence it is they account all other Miniſters but their Curats, and they
muſt not pray but as they will, and do nothing but what they will, Why?
becauſe they are but them ſubſtitutes, as if all offices were virtually in them,
and ſo came from them unto others; whereas every office in the Church, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the meaneſt, holds upon Chriſt the Head.</p>
               <p>Now it is true, in the civill State in ſome ſenſe it may he ſaid that the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
of the Common-wealth are in a kinde virtually in the King, he being
the ſupreame, but you muſt not thinke that all are thus virtually in him in
Church affaires, for if they were virtually in him, then he could himſelf diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
thoſe things that others by virtue of their office, can but that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
as to give the Sacrament and the like.</p>
               <p>But how is he the head then, or in what ſenſe may we quiet our Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in acknowledging the King to be the head of the Church?</p>
               <p>Onely thus he is ſaid to be the head, becauſe he is the ſupreame to govern
in a civill way, not onely the Civill State, but even affaires that belong to the
Church too. We doe not deny the power of Princes even in affaires that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to the Church. And becauſe he is the ſupreame in that civill power, to
governe in a civill way by civill Laws, ſo as to ſee Chriſt not diſhonoured,
ſo as to keepe out Idolatry, to protect the Church, to puniſh enormities that
are there, to defend it from enemies. In that ſenſe he is ſaid to be the head,
but that title of ſupreame Governor being underſtood in a civil way is more
proper.<note place="margin">That the King hath power in Church af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and how.</note> To make that a little out unto you; that there is ſome ſupremacy in
this, not onely in the civill State but in Church affaires: For wee muſt not
exclude the King quite out of all Church affaires, as ſome would do, no we
doe not; but though we would informe your conſciences aright, yet wee
would not by any meanes take away any lawfull power God hath put into
him. Now that he hath power even in Church affaires, there are many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
that fully move me to be perſwaded in it.</p>
               <p>The firſt that I ſhall name, I think it will leaſt prevail (though it be the
moſt ordinary) with them that make moſt doubt of it, therefore I will not
ſtand upon it, only name it. We know that all along among the Jews in the
time of the Old Teſtament, the Governours there, and Kings and Princes
had power in affaires that belong to the Church as well as to the State.</p>
               <p>But this I ſay I doe not think to be the greateſt ſtrength in this point, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
to p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ſwade them that make any ſcruple of it, they will us that the
power there was but Tipicall and the like, and ſobindeth not now.</p>
               <p>There are therefore other reaſons that perſwade the ſame thing.</p>
               <p>The firſt is this, becauſe I finde that in the Prophets,<note place="margin">1.</note> where wee have a
Propheſie of the ſtate of the Church in the times of the Goſpel. God doth
promiſe that he will make <hi>Kings</hi> to be their <hi>nurſing fathers,</hi> and <hi>Queens</hi> to
be their <hi>nurſing mothers.</hi> Now if they be to be nurſing fathers of the
Church, ſurely they muſt have ſome influence by their power into it.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2.</note> That place in <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. ſpealtes indifferently and faith, <hi>he is
the Miniſter for thy good.</hi> It doth not ſay for thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:42662:62"/>
this civill good or Eccleſiaſtical good, but <hi>he is the Miniſter for thy good,</hi>
for all good unto thee ſo farre as his power can reach.</p>
               <p>It is a hard thing you know (if men will put us unto it) to ſhew in the
New Teſtament the power that Kings had, becauſe there was then no King
but Heathens,<note place="margin">3.</note> yet ſaith he, they are Miniſters for thy good, and ſpeakes to
Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>But thirdly, and that which yet may ſeeme to have more in it, I finde
this in the New Teſtament that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> when he was accuſed by his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
in matters of Religion, hee did appeal unto <hi>Caeſar. Act.</hi> 25. 9. who
was a Heathen Magiſtrate, his accuſation was in matters of Religion, in
queſtions about their Law, and about one JESUS that was dead, whom
<hi>Paul</hi> affirmed to be alive.</p>
               <p>And yet in his anſwer to thoſe things he appealeth unto <hi>Caeſar,</hi> therefore
there is ſomewhat that <hi>Caeſar</hi> hath to doe in over-looking of the affaires of
the Church, that concerns the wayes of Religion.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, How can he be a competent Judge? Can <hi>Caeſar</hi> a
Heathen be a competent Judge in matters of Religion? Is it poſſible? Or
ſuppoſe that a Governour be wicked, can he be a competent Judge in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Religion?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, the wickedneſſe of a Governour, though he be a Heathen, yet
loſeth not his power, he hath ſtill a true and a lawfull power; yea he hath
ſome overſight of things that concerne Church affaires.</p>
               <p>How can that be?<note place="margin">Queſt.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Chriſtianity gives not the authority,<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> but enables to execute that authority,
a Heathen Magiſtrate hath authority, it is his duty to ſee that Chriſtians be
not wronged, and if he doth not it is his ſin, but if he becomes a Chriſtian, he
is the better able to do what he ought, but this puts not the power into him.</p>
               <p>But if a man be wicked,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> and underſtands not the things of the Church,
how can he be a judge?</p>
               <p>Thus,<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> though the King be not a competent judge of the Principles upon
which the Church goes, whether right or no, he hath not skill to do that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuch a one: yet he may have ability to judge betweene man and man,
whether one to the other doth wrong yea or no, and that in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
As thus; though he doth not think the Principles upon which they go
to be right, yet he can judge whether according to thoſe Principl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> they doe
right one to another, whether according to their Principles, they doe not
wrong one the other. And this is a great matter to be able to judge and to
puniſh with civill puniſhment when any of the Church wrongs his brother
againſt the Principles that himſelfe doth profeſſe.</p>
               <p>As for example, though he be not a Phyſitian, he doth not underſtand
the difference between the poyſon and a wholeſome Medicine, yet when
things are brought before him, he may be a competent judge, by evidence
ſo as to condemne a Phyſitian that hath poyſoned a man inſtead of giving of
him wholſome Phyſick.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:42662:62"/>
And that objection againſt his competency in judging in the affairs of the
Church hath no more power then if it ſhould have been objected that hee
muſt not judge upon a Phyſitian, whether he hath poyſoned a man or no,
becauſe he himſelf is not a Phyſitian. Thus wee have done with theſe three
conſequents that follow upon the opening of the headſhip of Chriſt in point
of his government. And now we ſee more clearly how Chriſt is head &amp; none
but Chriſt, &amp; what glory we are to give to Chriſt as the head of the Church.</p>
               <p>There is one thing more belongs to the head-ſhip of Chriſt which muſt
not be paſſed by, though it be not ſo fully aymed at in the text as what hath
already been ſaid, and that is the influence of ſpiritual life, that comes unto the
Church by Chriſt the head, as the animall ſpirits come from the head to the
members. And this is the very reaſon, firſt, why grace in the Saints is of
ſuch a beautifull and glorious nature as it is, becauſe it comes from Chriſt
the head.<note place="margin">The excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of grace in the Saints a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove what was in Ada<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> Secondly, This is the reaſon of that power and efficacy that there
is of grace in the Saints, becauſe it comes from Chriſt the head. Thirdly, this
is alſo the reaſon why grace in the Saints is of ſuch an everlaſting nature, and
that beyond that of <hi>Adam.</hi> It hath more beauty then the grace <hi>Adam</hi> had,
and it hath more power and efficacy then the grace <hi>Adam</hi> had, and it is of
a more everlaſting nature then that was, upon this ground, becauſe the grace
of the Saints holdeth upon Chriſt the head, &amp; hath an influence from Chriſt,
God-man in a ſpeciall and peculiar way, ſuch an influence as <hi>Adam</hi> had
not. This is the excellency of grace in the Saints.</p>
               <p>And to conclude this point of the Head-ſhip of Chriſt. The rather hath
God the Father thus advanced Chriſt to be the Head, becauſe he was willing
to ſtoop ſo low, to be as a worme under foot, for ſo he ſaith of himſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
22. 6. <hi>I am a worme, and no man.</hi> Chriſt was low in his own eyes, and
ſubmitted himſelf to ſuch a condition, and now behold the Father hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
him, for ſo it is ſaid, <hi>Epheſ. 1. 22. God hath made him head over
all things,</hi> hath made him head over principalities, and powers, and domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
over Angels, and over all men and all things in the Church, hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
him to this high and glorious dignity, we ſee ſomewhat of it now, and
we ſhall ſee more gloriouſly the head-ſhip of Chriſt hereafter.</p>
               <p>In this God the Father doth ſhew that as he hath dealt with his Sonne, ſo
he is willing to deale with the Members of his Son, in a proportion. His Son
that was willing to be ſo low and under foot, is now advanced to ſuch a high
glory that all muſt ſtoop, and yeeld, and ſubmit unto him.</p>
               <p>Let us be willing to lye low, and though it be under foot, to be troden up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by the wicked and ungodly of the world; though we cannot expect to be
advanced to be head, yet we may expect to be advanced to glory &amp; dignity.</p>
               <p>You know what God ſaid to <hi>Saul, 1 Sam. 15. When thou wert little in
thine own eyes then I made thee King.</hi>

               <p>The leſſe any of us are in our own eyes, the more are we like to be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

Chriſt the head, and his dealings with all his Members.</p>

               </p>
               <p>It is true, God the Father hath advanced his Son, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled
him above all things, and hath given him to be Head
over all: but yet when the Church, when the Saints ſhall
chooſe this Chriſt to be their Head, when they ſhall come in freely, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
ſubmit themſelves unto Chriſt, lifting him up above all, honoring his
ordinances, laws, inſtitutions, depending upon him for light; They are ſaid
to appoint Chriſt to be their Head.</p>
               <p>As, though Gods eternal Decree hath made himſelf to be the God of his
Saints, yet when the Saints do chooſe God to be their God, God doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
himſelfe to be made their God by them: they make God to be their
God in chooſing of him. So though Chriſt by the Father be appointed to
be the Head over all, yet the act of the Church in chooſing Chriſt, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to him freely, and ſubmitting unto him as to the Head, is accounted
even an appointing of Chriſt to be Head.</p>
               <p>This is that happy work which the Saints have been doing, and which we
are to doe, and they will doe to the end of the world, appointing Chriſt a
Head. Though there be ſome ſpeciall time that this Text hath reference un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
(of which by and by) yet in all Ages of the Church, when the Saints doe
chooſe Chriſt to be their Head, they are ſaid to <hi>appoint</hi> him.</p>
               <p>Let us joyne in this bleſſed work, an honourable work for creatures to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point

all men of Iſrael chooſe for King, his will I be, and with him will I abide.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So, He whom God the Father ſhall give to be Head over all things, him
whom the Saints have in all times choſen for their Head, it is he that ſhall be
our Head and our King, his will we be, and with him will we abide.</p>
               <p>Let us give Chriſt the preheminence above all, prizing his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

Whatſoever is high in our thoughts, as a head, let Chriſt be above it;</p>
               <p>Chriſt in his ordinances muſt be above the head of our joy. For otherwiſe
he is not a Head unto us. If you invite a man of quality to your table, though
you provide never ſuch chear for him, yet if you ſhould ſet any people of
meane quality above him, he would not regard all your courteſies. When
you tender up any thing unto Chriſt, when you ſeeme to entertaine him with
the greateſt reſpect, yet if there be any thing you ſet above him, eſpecially if
a vile luſt be ſet above him, he cares not for all your entertainment.</p>
               <p>We read in that <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 19. (the place we made uſe of in opening the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
point) that there were ſome blamed for <hi>not holding of the Head;</hi> What
is that? becauſe they gave more honour to Angels then was due unto them.</p>
               <p>It is ſpoken about the worſhipping of Angels, though never ſuch glorious
creatures, yet by over-prizing they come, not to hold of the Head. What, is
the giving undue honour to Angels enough to take us off from Chriſt the
Head? Certainly then the proſtrating our ſelves before our vile and baſe
luſts, doth much more take us off from holding Chriſt to be the Head.</p>
               <p>Let us look at all the offices and ordinances of Chriſt, as holding upon him
the Head (as you heard before) that ſo we may have a more reverent eſteem
of them. Let us depend upon him for influence of life, and not depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
means. Let us manifeſt in our converſation the ſpirit and life that wee
have received from ſuch a Head as Chriſt is, that we may not be a diſhon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
to this our head.</p>
               <p>I remember <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> in his Comment upon that firſt of the <hi>Epheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">We muſt not dishou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Head. <gap reason="foreign">

ſayes, in this regard wee muſt be better then Angels, yea greater then
Arch-angels, and he hath three moſt excellent expreſſions about this, that
Chriſtians ſhould take heed of <hi>diſhonouring Chriſt their Head.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, ſaith he, ſuppoſe a man had a precious Diadem upon his head, or a
crown of gold, that would be ſome argument unto him to make him take
heed of doing things unworthy of that ornament that is upon his head: and
we (ſaith he) have not a Diadem, wee have not a crowne of gold upon our
heads, we have Chriſt himſelf to be our Head, therefore let us doe nothing
unworthy of this our head.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he hath this expreſſion. O the honour (ſaith he) that God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordeth
unto us in this! the thought of this were enough to terrifie us from
ſin, more then the ſetting of hell it ſelf before our eyes. And indeed ſo it is.</p>
               <p>The right underſtanding of Chriſt to be our Head, and we having ſo neer
an union with him, is of power to terrifie us from ſin more then the ſight of
hell, if it were before us.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he goes on further. Saith he, What, is Chriſt your head? doe
you know next unto whom this your head doth ſit in heaven? Is he not pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
at the right hand of the Father above all principalities and powers? And
ſhal the members of this head be trampled upon by the Devil? God forbid.</p>
               <p>And yet ſo honour the head as to give the honor likewiſe to all that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, to thoſe that he hath placed for the adminiſtration of any ordinance
of his unto us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:42662:64"/>
We muſt not under pretence of giving Chriſt all the honour, diſhonour
thoſe that are ſet over us by Chriſt. We have a notable expreſſion of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
<hi>Paul, 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 12. where reproving the diſſentions of the Church of
<hi>Corinth: There are ſome</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that ſay we are of Paul, and others wee
are of Apollo, and others ſaid, we are of Cephas, &amp; others we are of Chriſt.</hi>
Why, are theſe all blamed? how could thoſe that ſaid that they held of Chriſt
be blarned? It is apparent that the Apoſtle blames them all, as well thoſe
that ſaid they did hold of Chriſt, as thoſe that ſaid they did hold of <hi>Paul,</hi> or
<hi>Apollo,</hi> or <hi>Cephas.</hi> How is that?</p>
               <p>Thus. Among the <hi>Corinths</hi> there were ſome that made diviſions, ſome
were for ſome officer, others for others; we are for <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid ſome, we for
<hi>Apollo</hi> ſaid others, and we for <hi>Cephas,</hi> and for our parts (ſaid others) wee
are for none of them all, we are neither for <hi>Paul,</hi> nor for <hi>Apollo,</hi> nor for <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas,</hi>
but we are for Chriſt, what are men? what are officers? what are Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances?
what are all thoſe to us? Chriſt is all in all unto us, he is our head,
and we are compleat in him, and we hold upon him, we are for neither of
all the other. Theſe are blamed as well as the other. We muſt ſo hold upon
Chriſt, as yet to give all due honour to the Ordinances, to the Inſtitutions,
to the Officers and Offices of Chriſt. Yet I confeſſe when any that are in
Chriſts ſtead to diſpence his ordinances unto us, if they prove to be wicked,
of all people in the world they are the moſt contemptible, and a juſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Mark, The Prophet there ſpeakes againſt thoſe that were in place and
power, though they were naught, yet ſtill they retained the name of <hi>ancient
and honourable,</hi> but <hi>the Prophet that teacheth lyes,</hi> a contemptiblename is
put upon him, he is <hi>the taile,</hi> no generation in the world more contemptible
then thoſe when once they degenerate.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, though they ſhould be vile in their lives, yet the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of them that are in office doth not hinder the virtue and efficacy of the
Ordinances, it depends not upon them. True, the efficacy of no Ordinance
depends upon men, and it is not either becauſe the Miniſter is vile, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants
are vile that communicate with you that can hinder the vertue of
an Ordinance. If the Church contract no guilt upon themſelves by retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuch in place, and by not caſting out ſuch as doe come into communion
with them. Take but that for granted that there is no guilt contracted.</p>
               <p>It is not the wickedneſſe then of the Miniſter or of the people that hinders
the efficacy of any Ordinance at all. But if it prove that there be guilt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
upon the Church through the negligence of their duty this way, then
the caſe is the ſame with thoſe of <hi>Corinth, 1 Cor. 5. 6. A little leaven lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veneth
the whole lump,</hi> what is that <hi>whole lump</hi> but their Communion?</p>
               <p>But was not Chriſt the Head before becauſe now it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note>

Now <hi>they ſhall appoint themſelves one Head,</hi> Chriſt to be their Head.</p>
               <p>Chriſt was the head to the Fathers under the Law, how now is he appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
their head?<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> Chriſt indeed was a head to the fore-fathers, but now in the
times of the Goſpel, eſpecially at theſe times that are ſpoken of here, at the

appeare to be a Head in another manner, to governe in another way, farre
more gloriouſly then now he doth, and far more influence of grace &amp; light
will come from him unto his members then now. Though Chriſt hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
been a head to his Church, yet there is a time comming when the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth

judgement the Scripture tells us that he ſhall <hi>give up the Kingdom unto his

<hi>many waters,</hi> but as a <hi>mighty thunder, ſaying, Allelujah, for the Lord God
Omnipotent reigneth.</hi> He ſhall be a head another way.</p>
               <p>Now if it bee true that Chriſt himſelf is appointed by the Church to be
head, then the officers and Miniſters of the Church ſhould not think much
to be appointed in their places by the Church too. It is true, their offices
hold on Chriſt the head, but the deſignation of perſons it muſt be from
ſome Church worke or other. Who of the Church, ſhould do it, we do not
now liſt to enter into any ſuch controverſie, but that there muſt be more

placed over me, ſome Church-work certainly there muſt be in this: Chriſt
himſelf would be appointed a head by his people, that they might ſubmit to
him the more chearfully, and give glory to him with the more freedome of

               </p>
               <p>They ſhall appoint to themſelves <hi>one Head.</hi> But one; The Church is
not a Monſter or divers heads, It hath but one head.</p>
               <p>There cannot be a miniſteriall head of the Church, Chriſt is alwayes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
and hath left his laws with his people. If we conſider the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Eccleſiaſticall power and Civill power, wee ſhall ſee it cleare that
there cannot be a miniſteriall head of the Church (indeed there is a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
in the very mention of it:<note place="margin">There can not be univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall officer in the Church as in the State and why;</note> a miniſteriall head? it is abſurd to ſpeake
it) It is true in the civill power, it is not againſt any inſtitution of Chriſt that
there ſhould be one head over all the world, nor againſt any law: But for to
have one head over the Church, yea to have any general officers over all the
Churches (to challengde a head-ſhip) it cannot be. The reaſon is, becauſe
there can be no delegation of power that belongs to the Church. There may
be a delegation of a civill power, one man may be King over many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys,
and he may appoint ſubſtitutes under him, and delegate them that they
ſhall officate under him. There is no ſuch matter in the Church, there is no
delegation of power from one to another. Grant but once delegation of the
teaching power here you ſtabliſh <hi>Non-reſidency;</hi> grant but delegation of
the ruling power and you preſently eſtabliſh a Papacy. There is no ſuch
thing therefore.</p>
               <p>Again, the civill power is by way of coaction, a Magiſtrate is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
bound to give a reaſon of his injunctions, he may by way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion
require obedience, But Church power is to deale with conſcience;
and therefore every one that hath any power muſt officiat himſelf, and deale
with the conſciences of men to perſwade and to inſtruct.</p>
               <p>Theſe two things being granted it is impoſſible that there can be a head o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
all the Churches, yea or over many. But one; We muſt joyne nothing
with JESUS CHRIST, in the way of his head-ſhip. As <hi>Alexander</hi>
ſaid to <hi>Darius,</hi> when he ſent unto him that he would be willing to divide the
Kingdom; No, ſaith <hi>Alexander,</hi> there is but one Sun in the firmament,
and there can be but one King in a Kingdom. So ſaith Chriſt, but one head
He head alone or no head at all; nothing muſt be joyned with him as head;</p>
               <p>Indeed the heathen gods <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> to divide their honours, and to.
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:42662:65"/>
have but ſome, and other to have ſome other: and hence the Senate of <hi>Rome</hi>
rejected Chriſt from taking in him to be a God, after they conſulted about
it, for ſaid they, if Chriſt come to be acknowledged a God he will not ſhare
with the reſt, he will have all himſelf, and ſo upon this reaſon they refuſed
him, Thus do many reject Chriſt for a head, and for a God, becauſe Chriſt
will not ſhare with others; he muſt be but one. And a ſpeciall help is here
to our faith in looking up to Chriſt for help and protection when all meanes
faile (I beſeech you obſerve it) What, doth Chriſt require of us that wee
ſhould make him head alone and joyne nothing with him as head? Then we
may well expect from him in all our wants, a protection, and that he alone
ſhould help us; or otherwiſe, the condition of a Chriſtian were the worſt
condition in the world, were worſe then the condition of a heathen: For the
gods of a heathen would be content to have but part of the honour of the
heart and life becauſe they could help but in part. If a heathen god ſhould
require the whole ſoulto be lifted up above all, and he alone to be honoured
and worſhipped as a God, and yet when it comes to a matter of helpe and
protection, he could doe nothing without ſome other joyned with him, a
heathen might well reaſon the eaſe with him as doing him wrong, certainly
Chriſt will never wrong his people, ſo as to challenge from them, that they
ſhould lift up him alone, and joyne no other with him, and yet when it
comes to their help and ſuccour that there ſhould be need to call in others
beſides himſelfe to their help. Therefore as Chriſt doth challenge it from
us to make him our head alone, ſo we may challenge it from Chriſt to helpe
us alone when there is no other helpe for us.</p>
               <p>Thus we have finiſhed both the head-ſhip of Chriſt, and the Churches
appointing him to be that head. Now followes the next mercy, the next
bleſſing, and that but in a word, and then we come to the concluſion of this
Chapter. <hi>They ſhall come up out of the land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aterrenis affectibus,</hi> So <hi>Jerome,</hi> he makes it a comming up from their
earthly ſenſes, earthly affections. <hi>A vita miſerabili,</hi> ſo <hi>Luther</hi> upon the
place, makes it a comming up from their miſerable life and condition.</p>
               <p>But rather thus, <hi>Come up out of the land,</hi> that is, out of their captivity.</p>
               <p>Judah and Iſrael they ſhall joyne together in comming to Jeruſalem, and
ſo joyne in the ſame kinde of worſhip, as they were wont to come out of
all parts of the countrey to worſhip at Jeruſalem, and there were united in
one kinde of worſhip, ſo they ſhall now come from all parts of the world
where they are ſcattered, and joyne in the ſame way of worſhip, yea and
it is very probable in their own land. There was a time when the people of
God did ſing ſongs of praiſe in the wilderneſſe, <hi>Exod,</hi> 15. But the time ſhall
come when they ſhall do it in their own land; and this ſhall be a bleſſing of
God upon them. <hi>Iſa. 26. 1. In that day ſhall this ſong be ſung in the land
of Judah, VVe have a ſtrong City, ſalvation will God appoint for walls
and bulworkes.</hi> It ſhall be ſung in the land of Judah,</p>
               <p>Ezek. 20. 40. In the mountaines of the height of Iſrael, ſaith the Lord
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:42662:66"/>
God, there ſhall all the houſe of Iſrael, all of them in the land ſerve me,
there will I accept them, and there will I require your offerings, and the
firſt fruites of your oblations, with all your holy things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ezekiel. 37. 21. I will take the children of Iſrael from among the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
whether they begone, and will gather them on every ſide, and bring
them into their own land.</hi> This bleſſing hath God granted unto many of
his ſervants this day; who never thought to have ſeen their owne land, their
own good land: but God hath bin pleaſed to gather them up that they are
come not onely into their own land, but they finde the armes and hearts of
the Saints open to imbrace them, and call them to publicke imployments.</p>
               <p>It was not long ſince that the land could not beare them; we hope that the
time may come ere long that the Lord Chriſt may ſo rule and that in our
land, that it will as hardly beare wicked and ungodly men as it hath borne
the Saints, though it were hard to ſay that there ſhould be ſo much violence
uſed even to keep them from ſome ſins, as hath been uſed here againſt the
Saints to keep them from their God, yet time may come ere long that wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
men may be glad to flye (though not forced unto it) out of their owne
choyce, into another land, becauſe they cannot have the enjoyment of their
luſts ſo freely here: As the Saints have been forced to flye out of their land
that they might ſerve the Lord and keep their conſciences cleare.</p>
               <p>But we let this paſſe, and come now to the cloſe of the Chapter to the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonema</hi>
of it all. <hi>For great ſhall be the day of Jezreel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They ſhall appoint themſelves one head, and come up out of the land, <hi>for</hi>
great, <hi>Licet,</hi> ſo <hi>Tremelius</hi> turnes it, <hi>although</hi> the day of <hi>Jezreel</hi> be great:
&amp; indeed the Hebrew particle <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifieth <hi>quamvis</hi> as well as <hi>quia,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Obſerv.</note> It may
be tranſlated [<hi>although</hi>] as well as [<hi>for</hi>] And he tranſlating it ſo, <hi>although
the day of Iezreel be great,</hi> he takes it in this ſenſe, that is, although the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Iſrael ſhall be brought into great affliction, yet God will be ſo merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
then when his time comes, as they ſhall be gathered together again, and
appoint themſelves one head, and come up out of the land. And from ſuch
an interpretation of the words there might be an excellent meditation raiſed,
and that is this. That the greatneſſe of the miſery of the Church is no hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance
to the courſe of the freeneſſe and abundance of Gods mercy to it.</p>
               <p>Although the day of <hi>Iezreel,</hi> their day be never ſo calamitous, never ſo
afflictive, never ſo grievous, yet they ſhall come up out of the land and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
themſelves one head. The greatneſſe of the Churches miſery is no hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance
unto the Churches delivery: Why? becauſe their deliverance de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth
upon a God who doth delight not onely to manifeſt ſome power,
but the excellency, and the glory, and the choyce of his power in their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.
For that take this Scripture, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62. 8. Where ſpeaking of theſe
very times that we ſhall heare of afterward, of Gods being mercifull unto his
people, he ſaith, <hi>The Lord hath ſworne by his right hand:</hi> and we have not
onely mention thereof Gods right hand and ſwearing by it, but the arme of
God too; Marke that, <hi>The arme of God and the arme of his ſtrength:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:42662:66"/>
There is Gods hand, Gods arme,<note place="margin">Lect. 6.</note> the arme of his ſtrength, &amp; God ſweareth
by it.<note place="margin">The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Churches affliction is no hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the deliverance of it.</note> Surely when God delighteth to put forth ſuch power for the deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of his Church, it is no great matter whether the afflicted eſtate be great
or ſmall. It makes no great matter for the hinderance of the Churches deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
no more then if you ſhould ſee two bubbles of water riſe up, &amp; one hath
a little thicker skin then the other. Now there is as much difference in the
difficulty that the thick skin bubble makes when a mighty Cannon or peece
of Ordnance ſhal be ſhot off with a mighty Bullet to reſiſt it, from the thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
skin bubble, as the greateſt and foreſt affliction that the people of God
were ever under in this world makes a difference in the difficulty of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
(when they have to deale with an infinite God) from the leaſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
that ever the Church was in. The difference is no more. If a childe
indeed ſhould ſee the thicker skin bubble, he might thinke tis harder to be
broke then the thinner skin, but if a Cannon ſhould be ſhot off, nay if it be
but a Fillip, it makes no difference. Now the afflictions of Gods people they
are to this right hand of Gods power, and the arme of his ſtrength, but as a
bubble of water before a mighty Cannon. Yea if there be not help at all to
deliver Gods people in time of affliction yet God can create helpe, <hi>He will
create Jeruſalem a rejoycing, and their people a joy.</hi> Yea ſuppoſe their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
be ſuch as yet never was the like ſince the beginning of the world, yet
<hi>Iſa, 64. 4. Since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the care, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>either hath the eye ſeene what God hath prepared for them
that waite for him.</hi> And as the greatneſſe of the Churches deliverance is no
hinderance of Gods power in delivering them, ſo it ſhould be no hinderance
to the work of our faith. Common prudence and reaſon will go a great way
to uphold us under ſome affliction, but when the affliction comes to be ſore,
and grievous, and long; prudence &amp; reaſon then ſinketh under the burthen;
but then ſhould faith lift up it ſelfe, and caſt an eye upon this right hand of
Gods power, this arme of his ſtrength that he hath ſworne by, and exerciſe it
ſelf in the glorious acts of it. For certainly faith is appointed for ſuch a time
as this, when the Church is under grievous extremities. The ordinary afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Church do not call for ſuch a work of faith, but when they come
to extraordinary that requires ſuch a power of God for their deliverance,
then there is called for a worke of faith proportionable, as <hi>Alexander</hi> when
he was in great danger, Now (ſaith he) there is a danger fit for the ſpirit of
<hi>Alexander</hi> to incounter withall.<note place="margin">Iam peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> animo A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexitiri.</note> So when the Church comes to be in any
great danger, all the members of it ſhould ſay, here is a danger, here is a
trouble fit for the ſpirit of Chriſtians, fit for the ſpirits of thoſe that are able
to exerciſe the moſt noble and glorious acts of faith.</p>
               <p>This glorious exerciſe of faith, I may even ſay we are ſcarce yet for the
preſent put to it, for reaſon and ſenſe ſees much help, they ſee that the cauſe
of God at this day hath the better of the adverſary; reaſon I ſay and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
may ſee far this way. Let us not look upon every difficulty as a thing
that calleth for ſuch a mighty glorious worke of faith, whereas men by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:42662:67"/>
and prudence, and may carry themſelves under ſuch difficulties much
better then moſt of us doe. But we do not know but the Lord may call us
unto ſuch difficulties and dangers as requires ſuch a faith as hath ſuch a kinde
of work as I have ſpoken of. Let us therefore lay up this Inſtruction for the
time to come. Again, <hi>for great ſhall be the day of Jezreel,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the words be read thus (as they are in your Bibles) and yet have refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to the calamitous time, and grievous extremities of the day of <hi>Jezreel,</hi>
then there will be theſe two excellent meditations from thence. The firſt is,</p>
               <p>That Gods bowels of compaſſion do work toward his Church becauſe of
the greatneſſe of their affliction.<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> When their afflictions ſhall be very great,
and the greater they are, the more do Gods bowels of compaſſion work to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
them. We know the miſery of Gods people in <hi>Exo.</hi> 3. was a marvail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
quickning argument to the compaſſion of God (as I may ſo ſpeake) <hi>I
have ſeene, I have ſeene</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the affliction of my people, and their ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes,
and therefore am come down to deliver them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the greatneſs of the affliction of the Church move the bowels of Gods
compaſſion, then let not the greatneſſe of affliction hinder our faith. Let not
the greatneſſe of trouble reaſon down our faith, but rather let it reaſon up
our faith, for ſo indeed it ſhould; and ſo the Saints of God heretofore have
done, by the greatneſs of the trouble we muſt reaſon up our faith as thus: <hi>It
is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>me for thee O Lord to work, for men have almoſt deſtroyed thy law; yea
the high time is come for thee to have mercy upon Zion,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Afflictions should raiſe our hearts.</note> 
                  <hi>for thy people begin
to favour the duſt thereof.</hi> What, was this a good argument, <hi>Have mercy u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
me, and pardon my ſin for it is very great,</hi> to move God withall? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
then this is a good argument, Deliver us in our afflictions, for they are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
great: for ſin makes a great deale more diſtance betweene God and us
then afflictions: yet if the greatneſs of ſin ſhall come to be put as an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for Gods mercy and compaſſion to work, much more the greatneſs
of afflictions. Yet this is the grace of God in the ſecond Covenant that even
the ſins that before made the creature the object of hatred, thoſe ſins come
now to make it an object of compaſſion. So afflictions that before were
part of the curſe, they come now to be arguments for the moving of the
bowels of Gods tender compaſſion toward his people. Another note (if
you read it ſo, <hi>for great is their affliction</hi>) is this, the promiſe is the only ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of the ſoul,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> and that which carrieth it thorow the greateſt affliction.</p>
               <p>Afflictions are as leade to the net, the promiſe is as the corke, the promiſe
keepes above water when the lead pulls down. But I leave theſe medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
though I finde many interpreters run this way. And I rather take it
as a further expresſion of Gods wonderfull mercy unto his Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For great ſhall be the day of Jezreel,</hi> That is, God hath a great day of
mercy for <hi>Jezreel.</hi> That is the meaning, they ſhall appoint themſelves one
head, they ſhall be gathered together and be made one, they ſhall come up
out of the land, why? for God hath yet to come a great day of mercy to his
pepole, <hi>A gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap> day of Jezreel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:42662:67"/>
And herein therefore God makes uſe of the name of <hi>Jezreel</hi> in a good
ſenſe. They that carry it the other way would carry the ſignification of the
name thus, for great is the day of <hi>ſcattering,</hi> of the ſcattered people, ſo <hi>Iez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reel</hi>
ſignifieth (as you heard in the beginning of the Chapter) But <hi>Jezreel</hi>
ſignifieth likewiſe <hi>the ſeed of God.</hi> Before God made uſe of their name in
the worſe ſenſe, that he would ſcatter them according to their name; now
he makes uſe of their name in the beſt ſenſe, they are the ſeed of God, and
there is great mercy from God for them.</p>
               <p>When God is reconciled unto a people,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> he takes all in the beſt ſenſe and
makes the beſt acception of every thing, as he doth here of the name <hi>Jezreel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have onely theſe two things to conſider of in this expreſſion.</p>
               <p>1. That the Saints of God, and the Church, they are Gods <hi>Jezreel.</hi>
That is, they are the ſeed of God.</p>
               <p>2. That there is for this ſeed of God a great day.</p>
               <p>1. They are the ſeed of God. The ſeed of the bleſſed, and there is a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
in them. They are the precious ſeed that God preſerves in the world, &amp;
hath done ever ſince the beginning of the world. They are that ſeed that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth
the glory of God in the world. Were it not for a few gracious, holy
people in the world, where would the glory of God be? What would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of it? Thoſe that are godly, however contemptible in the world, they
are the precious ſeed that God reſerves in the world for great and glorious
ends. They are the ſeed to preſerve the continuation of the Doctrine of the
Goſpell, and the bleſſed truths of God; as <hi>Iſa. 6. 13. The holy ſeed ſhall be
the ſubſtance thereof.</hi> Though they ſhall be under great afflictions, yet there
ſhall be a holy ſeed that ſhall be the ſubſtance thereof, and there ſhall be his
bleſſing.<note place="margin">The godly are preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſeed. <hi>Filibatur nomen e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Pſal. 72. 17. His name ſhall endure from generation to generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi>
the words are read by <hi>Montanus, His name ſhall be childed,</hi> that is, ſo
continued as families are continued, one generation after another, one beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
another: and ſo ſhall the name of Chriſt continue in the world, and ſo
it hath done. And though ſeed be but a handfull in compariſon of the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt,
ſo the Saints of God then were, and yet are but as a handfull in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
of the glorious harveſt that ſhall be, yet they are very precious before
God, and God will make the world hereafter know that they are the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ones of God, <hi>Iſa. 61. 9. All that ſee them ſhall acknowledge them that
they are the ſeed which the Lord hath bleſſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seed (you know) a man will be carefull of that what ever becomes of his
other corne. In the time of dearth the husbandman wil rather pinch his own
belly, then have his ſeed-corne to be ſpent. So in times of common calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
of common dearth, yet Gods care is over his ſeed; the Saints are (as I
may ſay) Gods ſeed-corne to preſerve his name in the world, to other gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
that are to come, he will not therefore have them deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>Seed is the moſt precious of the corne, which is moſt winnowed and made
cleane, and ſo are the Saints, the cleane ones and the moſt precious ones.</p>
               <p>God perhaps doth winnow them and fanne them more than he doth others
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:42662:68"/>
by the fannes and winnows of afflictions, why? becauſe they are his ſeed.</p>
               <p>Perhaps other corne that hath droſſe in it, the husband-man will give the
fowles and the cattell that, he beſtoweth not much winnowing upon it, but
the corne that is for ſeed he winnows that, he would not willingly have a der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell
amongſt it. It may be thou complaineſt thou art more winnowed, more
fanned then other men, perhaps thou art more precious in Gods eyes, thou
art to be reſerved as ſeed, as the ſeed of the bleſſed.</p>
               <p>The wicked indeed they are ſeed too, but a corrupt ſeed, <hi>a ſeede of evill
deers, Eſay,</hi> 1. the grand-father was an enemy unto God, yea the great
grand-father, and the father, and the children after him continue enemies to
God. And God in mercy unto his Church doth many times cut downe the
wicked before they do ſeed too much. As you that have gardens, if they have
weeds in them, and you ſee the weeds come up and grow to ſeed, you think
then that it is time to pull them up, you will not ſuffer them to ſeed. God
lookes upon many families and ſees wretched and ſinfull men as a ſeed of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
doers, and ſees they are ready to ſeed, and if they be not cut down ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
there will be a wretched brood of wicked ones in ſuch a family.<note place="margin">The wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt ſeed.</note> This is
the reaſon of Gods ſuddain cutting down of many wicked families.</p>
               <p>But to come to the point that is chiefly intended, that is, That this ſeed of
the Lord ſhall have a great day. <hi>Great ſhall be the day of Jezreel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The men of the world they have their day in which they ruffle it out, and
they have all the doings. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſeemes to ſpeake of this in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 3.
he ſaith there that he did not paſſe <hi>for mans judgement,</hi> the word is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>for mans day.</hi> Now men have the day, they have all the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

another day, beſides mans day. I know not how it commeth to paſſe
to be otherwiſe tranſlated, you tranſlate it judgement in your books, but in
the Originall it is <hi>day,</hi> Man hath a day.</p>
               <p>As men have a day, ſo ſhall Gods Saints have a day too. Wee uſe to ſay
many times when we ſee the Malignant party jocund and merry, ſurely they
hope to have a day. My brethren be joyfull in the Lord, God hath a day for
you, and a great day too, <hi>Great ſhall be the day of Jezreel.</hi> The beginning
of Gods mercy to his people is called <hi>a day of ſmall things, Zach.</hi> 4. 10. and
that muſt not be deſpiſed, <hi>Let no man deſpiſe the day of ſmall things.</hi> It was
the beginning of the reformation and deliverance of the people of Judah
from their captivity.<note place="margin">1.</note> But God hath a day of great things, and certainly that
day ſhall be honorable. A day firſt in which the glory of God ſhall excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
appear, wherein God ſhal be (as I may ſo ſpeak with holy reverence)
as it were in his robes: As we know Princes upon great dayes put on their
robes, ſo the King of glory ſhall have a day for his people, wherein even he
himſelf will put on his robes, <hi>Pſ. 102. 16. When the Lord ſhall build up Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he ſhall appear in his glory.</hi> It ſeemeth while the Church is in affliction,
while the witneſſes propheſie in ſack-cloath, God is as it were cloathed in
ſack-cloath, In all their afflictions he is afflicted, but becauſe God hath a
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:42662:68"/>
day, a great day to his Churches, he will reſerve his robes till then, and when
that day commeth he will put on his robes, for <hi>when he ſhall build up Zion</hi>
(ſaith the Text) <hi>then the Lord ſhall appeare in his glory.</hi> A great day it
ſhall be for <hi>Jezreel,</hi> for the ſeed of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2,</note> It ſhall be a great day, for this day ſhall be <hi>the riches of the
world.</hi> Marke that place in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 12, ſpeaking of the Jews, <hi>If their fall</hi>
(ſaith he) <hi>be the riches of the world, and their diminishing the riches of the
Gentiles, how much more their fulneſs?</hi> It was a rich mercy to the Gentiles
when they were brought out of darkneſſe, and called into the knowledge of
Jeſus Chriſt, here was riches to the world of the Gentiles: But God hath a
greater day then that, for it is ſpoken here of a day that is to come, that is,
their fall was the riches of the Gentiles, much more their calling in again.</p>
               <p>So then there is ſuch a day of calling home the people of God, as ſhall be
the riches of the Gentiles, the riches of all the world.</p>
               <p>Yea Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. That place Dan. 12. 2. opened, not underſtood of the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erall reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection at the laſt day and why.</note> Great ſhall be this day, for it ſhall be as a day of reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from death to life: ſo <hi>Dan. 12. 2. Many of them that ſleepe in the duſt
ſhall awake, &amp;c.</hi> It is not ſpoken of the great reſurrection at the laſt day of
judgement, for Firſt, It is ſpoken but of <hi>ſome</hi> that ſhall ariſe:</p>
               <p>Secondly, The greateſt glory that is here put upon the juſt, is but to <hi>ſhine
as the ſtars in the firmament,</hi> but at the laſt day the Saints ſhall <hi>ſhine as the
ſunne in the firmament,</hi> more and above the ſtarres. Yea,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This that is here revealed to <hi>Daniel</hi> muſt be <hi>ſealed up as a great
ſecret till the appointed time come;</hi> but for the Reſurrection at the laſt day
that is no great ſecret, that they knew well enough, it is not as a ſecret to be
ſhut up and ſealed from men till the time appointed come. But this Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
here ſpoken of, it is to be ſealed up as a great ſecret that was not
knowne in the world, nor ſhould be much knowne till the appointed time
ſhould come. And then Laſtly, It was promiſed to <hi>Daniel</hi> in the 13. <hi>ver.</hi>
that he ſhould <hi>ſtand up in his lot,</hi> as a peculiar and ſpeciall favour that God
ſtould beſtow upon him. Now it is not ſuch a peculiar and ſpecial favour for
a Saint to ſtand up at the great day, at the laſt day, this was a favour to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi>
as an eminent Saint, that he ſhould ſtand up thus in his lot. Therefore
this Reſurrection is the ſame with this great day of <hi>Jezreel,</hi> wherein there
ſhall be ſuch a glorious work of God in calling Iſrael and Judah together &amp;
the fulneſs of the Gentiles, that it ſhall be as the Reſurrection from death to
life; ſo the Apoſtle calls it likewiſe in that <hi>Rom. 11. 15. What ſhall the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
of them be but life from the dead?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. <hi>Great ſhall be the day of Iezreel,</hi> for this ſhall bring refreſhing to all
the Saints, this is <hi>the time of the refreſhing, Act.</hi> 3. 19. There ſhall be ſuch
things then as will refreſh and revive the ſpirits of all the Saints. Yea,</p>
               <p>5. It ſhall be the day of reſtitution of all things. <hi>Acts 3. 21. Vntill the
times of reſt it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> of all things come, which God hath ſpoken by the mouth
of all his Prop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> ſince the world began.</hi> I know it is ordinary carryed by
many another way, concerning the laſt day; but that it cannot be ſo, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:42662:69"/>
becauſe that then there ſhall not be the reſtitution of all things, but the
annihilation of many things. Further, this ſpeakes of a reſtitution of all
things, that was ſpoken of by the mouth of all the holy Prophets. Now the
holy Prophets ſpake but very little concerning the day of Judgment, of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
life to come, we reade but little of it in the Prophets; and therefore the
Apoſtle in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 10. ſaith, that <hi>life and immortality was brought to light
through the Goſpel.</hi> Not but that it was known ſomewhat before, but it
was very darkly known, there was very little ſpoken of life and immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in the Prophets; But this ſpeaks of a time that all the holy Prophets ſpake
of as an argument that was the general theame of them all. And indeed
there is no argument whatſoever that is more general among the Prophets,
then this great argument of this great day of <hi>Jezreel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, 6. <hi>A great day,</hi> for it ſhall be a new creation; a new heaven and
a new earth ſhall be made when this great day of <hi>Iezreel</hi> ſhall come.<note place="margin">6.</note> 
                  <hi>Eſay,</hi>
66. 17. <hi>Behold I create new heavens and a new earth:</hi> And in <hi>ver.</hi> 18. if
you obſerve it, you ſhall ſee what this <hi>new heaven</hi> and this <hi>new earth</hi> is: <hi>But
be glad and rejoyce for ever in that which I create, for behold I create Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem
are joycing, and her people a joy.</hi> Thoſe are the new heavens &amp; the
new earth that are to be created: and this is meant of the Church plainly, for
the Text, <hi>ver.</hi> 21. ſpeakes of <hi>building houſes,</hi> and inhabiting them, and of
<hi>planting vineyards,</hi> and <hi>eating the fruit</hi> of them, upon theſe new heavens &amp;
this new earths creation. And 2 <hi>Pet. 3. 13. Nevertheleſſe according to this
promiſe, we looke for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe.</hi>
Now where is this promiſe? This is uſually taken for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of heaven hereafter. But where is this promiſe? We do not finde it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
where but in that place I named before, <hi>Eſay,</hi> 65. Now it is apparent that
promiſe doth ſpeak of an eſtate of the Church here in this world; and there
is ſpoken of a new earth, as well as of a new heaven; if it were onely ſpoken
of new heavens, it had bin another matter, but it ſpeaks of a new earth like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
therefore meant of an eſtate in this world, a new creation of a new
heaven and earth, that is, there ſhall be ſuch glorious things done by God, as
ſhall manifeſt a creating power, as if God did now make <hi>new heavens</hi> and
a <hi>new earth.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">7.</note> 7. <hi>Great ſhal be the day of Iezreel,</hi> for it ſhall be as another
world, when this day cometh. <hi>Heb. 2. 5. 6. 7. 8. Vnto the Angels hath he
not put in ſubjection the world to come, whereof we ſpeak. But one in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
place teſtified,</hi> (this certain place is in <hi>Pſa.</hi> 104.) <hi>ſaying: What is man
that thou art mindful of him, or the ſon of man that thou viſiteſt him? Thou
haſt made him little lower then the Angels, thou crownedſt him with glory
and honour, and didſt ſet him over the works of thy hands, thou haſt put all
things in ſubjection under his feet.</hi> This is clearly interpreted of Chriſt, (as
verſ. 9. and ſo on) that all things muſt be ſubjected to hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> things in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
under his feet. This the Apoſtle interpreteth of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:42662:69"/>
But ſaith he, wee ſee not yet all things put under him, that time is yet to
come, for, ſaith he, <hi>We ſpeak of things that concerne the world to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore (mark my brethren) there muſt be ſuch a time wherein all
things, all creatures muſt be put under ſubjection to Chriſt, and this is in the
world to come. Not in that world to come where the Saints ſhall raign glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
in heaven, it cannot be meant of that, for the heavens muſt depart as
a ſcroll, and many things ſhall then rather be annihilated, and the <hi>Kingdome</hi>
muſt then be <hi>given up by Chriſt to God the Father,</hi> ſo the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor</hi>
15. that is, when the Saints ſhall reigne gloriouſly with Chriſt in heaven.</p>
               <p>But here this place ſpeaks of a time when all creatures muſt come under
ſubjection to Chriſt, and it is called <hi>the world to come,</hi> why? becauſe of the
great change there ſhall be of things, it ſhall be (as it were) a new world. As
we call this world from <hi>Noahs</hi> time a new world, and when we ſpeak of the
other world we call it the old world; ſo the Scripture calls it, 2 <hi>Pet. 2. 5. God
ſpared not the old world:</hi> And <hi>Chap. 3. 6. The world that then was being
overflowed with water, periſhed.</hi> So this world that we live in is as the old
world, and there is this day of <hi>Jezreel,</hi> in which there ſhall be ſuch a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
change, all things being put in ſubjection under Chriſt, that it ſhall be as
it were a new world, God hath made an excellent world in which there is
much beauty and glory, and yet his enemies have the rule here; what then
will that world be that God intends for his Saints?</p>
               <p>8. Great ſhall be the day of Jezreel.<note place="margin">8.</note> 
                  <hi>It ſhall be ſuch a great day that all
former things ſhall be even forgotten becauſe of the luſtre and glory of that
great day. As</hi> Iſa. 65. 17. The former heavens and the former earth ſhall
not be remembred nor come into mind; <hi>And ſo</hi> Jer. 3. 16. In thoſe dayes ſaith
the Lord, they ſhall ſay no more the Arke of the Covenant of the Lord, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhall it come to minde, neither ſhal they remember it; at that time they
ſhal call Jeruſalem the Throne of the Lord, and all the nations ſhal be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
unto it, to the name of the Lord, to Jeruſalem, neither ſhal they walk
any more after the imagination of their evil hearts (<hi>mark my brethren</hi>) In
thoſe dayes the houſe of Judah ſhall walke together, <hi>ver. 18. It is apparent
that it is ſpoken of this great day of</hi> Iezreel; <hi>for now God ſaith he will</hi> ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Iudah and Iſrael together, <hi>and here he ſaith that they ſhall</hi> walke toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>and that then former things ſhall be forgotten; they ſhall call Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem
the Throne of the Lord; heretofore even the Temple it ſelf the glory of
Jeruſalem was but as the place of Gods feet, and the Arke of God was but
Gods footſtool.</hi> 1 Chron. 28. 2. It was in mine heart (<hi>ſaith</hi> David) to build
a houſe of reſt for the Arke of the Covenant of the Lord, and for the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoole
of our God; <hi>and</hi> Iſa. 60. 13. I will make Zion the place of my feet glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.
<hi>But now in this great day,</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>that was but</hi> Gods foot ſtool, <hi>the
place of his feet, ſhall be</hi> Gods Throue; <hi>a great day certainly this ſhall be
when all things ſhall be thus forgotten.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the laſt place, <hi>a great day,</hi> becauſe it ſhall be a day after which there
ſhal be no night. And that you will ſay will be a great day indeed, after which
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:42662:70"/>
the Saints ſhall be raiſed to ſuch a ſtate of proſperity and happineſs that ſhall
never fall again, that ſhall never come to be darkened any more. The Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
here many times have had ſome little releaſe, they have had their dayes
of peace for a while, but it hath ſoone grown to be night, and a diſmall night
of darkneſs. But when this great day ſhall come it ſhall be a day that ſhall
never have night, for ſo God promiſeth here to his <hi>Jezreel,</hi> to make it to be
an <hi>eternal excellency,</hi> and to make Jeruſalem an <hi>everlaſting joy,</hi> and <hi>Dan.</hi>
2. 44. God ſhall in the dayes of thoſe Kings ſet up a <hi>Kingdom that ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be deſtroyed,</hi> that is, the great day of <hi>Jezreel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt thing that ſhall be done in this great day of <hi>Iezreel,</hi> ſhall be the
deliverance of the Churches from wofull affliction which they ſhal be found
to be in a little before. For ſo the Scripture tells us, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 1. that <hi>before
this day there ſhall be a time of trouble ſuch as never was ſince there was a
nation even to that ſame time, and at that time thy people ſhall be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
I might tell you much how ſome of the Ancients have ſpoken of this,
that though it be a point that ſeemes to be ſomewhat ſtrange to us,<note place="margin">Ego au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem &amp; qui ſunt per omnia orthodoxae ſententiae Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni, &amp;c.</note> yet it was
one of the moſt ordinarieſt things that was known in the primitive times. It
was then ſo generally acknowledged, that I remember <hi>Juſt in Martyr</hi> (who
was but 30. years after Saint <hi>John</hi>) hath ſuch an expreſſion as this, There is
no man (ſaith he) that is of the Orthodox faith in all things, but he doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge

chapters he ſpends in ſhewing the glory of this great day of <hi>Iezreel,</hi> but

               <p>Theſe expreſſions he hath, So that great times of affliction will be before
that great day; and it is therefore called <hi>a great day,</hi> becauſe God appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

working in the hearts of men, and giveth us ſuch a time of reviving, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth

and by this he will prepare people for thoſe times, God will have a

great ſeed that he intends to be in the world, therefore ſo many young peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are converted and are ſo forward, becauſe I ſay God meanes to prepare
them by this light that we now have, for this ſeed, for this great day. And
you that are young may expect to go thorow ſome difficulties &amp; hardſhip
before this great day comes, but be of good comfort, you may hope to live to
ſee all the glory of this great day, and God gives you now time that you may
lay up, and be fit ſeed for ſuch a glorious day as this, that you may not when
ſufferings come, be found among the number of the <hi>fearfull</hi> ones, ſpoken of

               </p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2.</note> a great day in ſubduing the adverſaries of the Church. Though

but it ſhall be that they may be deſtroyed, for God hath a great feaſt
and a great Sacrifice, and he will ſacrifice them eſpecially. And therefore
<hi>Lactantius</hi> that I ſpoke of before, and is one that lived 1300. yeares ſince,
ſaith he (ſpeaking then of this day) I have a thing to ſay, but I even tremble
to ſpeake it, but I muſt ſpeake it, and what was it? <hi>Romanum nomen</hi> (ſaith
he) <hi>de terra tolletur;</hi> thoſe are his words, the Roman name ſhall be taken off
from the earth. He in thoſe primitive times proph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Rome.</hi> Perhaps though he did not ſee it ſo clearly, yet God might ſo order it,
as though hee underſtood it not, God might intend it for theſe times. God
will deſtroy the enemies of his Churches then. Yea. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 28. 24. there is a
promiſe to the Saints that there ſhall beno more a <hi>pricking bryar, nor any
grieving thorne</hi> of any that are round about them that deſpiſe them, &amp; in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
place God ſaith that he will <hi>take away the Canaanite out of the Land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Further,<note place="margin">.3</note> the third thing that ſhall be done in this great day, is the glorious
preſence of Chriſt among the Saints, let it be perſonall or what it will, wee
determine not, but thus far we may confidently affirme that there ſhall be a
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:42662:71"/>
more glorious preſence of Jeſus Chriſt among his people,<note place="margin">Lect. 7,</note> then ever yet was
ſince the beginning of the world. <hi>Rev. 21. 22. The Lord God Almighty,

God and of the Lamb ſhal be in it, and his ſervants ſhall ſerve him, &amp; they

               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, the glory that ſhall be put upon the Saints at that day, ſhewes it
to be a great day. Glory ſhall be put upon them, firſt in regard of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
gifts &amp; graces they ſhall be heightned and inlarged, the weake ſhall
be as <hi>David,</hi> and they that are as <hi>David</hi> ſhall be as the Angel of God at that
day. The bowing down of their adverſaries before them, The high eſteeme
that they ſhall have, even in the thoughts and judgments of many great ones
of the world, they ſhall be called up to heaven, that is, thoſe that are in high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
place and dignity, ſhall call them up and honour them in that day, yea the
Text ſaith, <hi>The Kings of the earth in that day ſhall came in, and bring their
glory to the Church.</hi> Therefore it is apparent, that place <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 24. cannot
be underſtood of heaven, for it is ſaid, <hi>the Kings of the earth ſhal bring their
glory,</hi> they ſhall not bring their glory to the Church, when the Church ſhall

               <p>Though fleſh and blood may reaſon againſt theſe things, yet I may apply

                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:42662:71"/>
But let all fleſh be ſilent, for God hath made known in his Word, the great
things that he intends to bring to paſſe. And <hi>Zach. 8. 6. Thus ſaith the Lord
of Hoſts, if it be marvaylous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in theſe

               </p>
               <p>It may be applyed to this as well as the other. Theſe things may ſeeme
marveilous to your eyes, eſpecially becauſe we have been but little acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with them, but they are not marveilons in the eyes of God. Yea we find
it out of the Word that theſe things were to be kept hidden till the appointed
time ſhould come, till we draw neerer to that great day; we are not to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

God telleth <hi>Iohn that he muſt prophe ſie again before the Kings of the earth,</hi>

               <p>In <hi>Zach.</hi> 14. 6. you have mention of a day, that we may apply to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent

<hi>that the light ſhall not be cleere nor darke, but it ſhall be one day which ſhall

be not as cleere as we deſire; therfore this is now a day which is neither cleer
nor darke, but even as it were twilight. Well but it ſhall be one day that is
one ſpecial day, and indeed it is our day now, it is the greateſt day that ever
yet England had. It ſhall be one day which ſhall be knowne to the Lord,
a day wherein the Lord hath great thoughts and purpoſes to do great things,
and certainly this our day is known to the Lord, great things God is about
to do for his Churches, &amp; laying a foundation of glorious things for the good
of his people. And then mark, though it be neither <hi>day</hi> nor <hi>night,</hi> yet <hi>at the

ſurely then it muſt needes be more darke: No, though it be not cleere now,
though it be a cloudy day and part of it darke,<note place="margin">In the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening time it shal be light.</note> yet at the evening time it ſhall
be light: When it ſhall be leaſt expected to have light, and when we ſhall
moſt feare darkneſſe, when wee ſhall be ready to conclude, O our day is
gone, once indeed God did bring a day to England, a comfortable day
though it was a little darke, yet there was a glorious light in compariſon of
what we had before, but now it is grown towards evening, the evening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins

they will be ready to have their hearts ſink within them, and to cry
out, now our day is gone and the evening is comming, &amp; we muſt look for
darkneſs, yea and feare a diſmall darkneſſe. Now my brethren, be of good
comfort, for <hi>at evening time it ſhall be light;</hi> when we think it ſhall be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening,
when it is moſt unlikely to be light, then ſhall the light of the Lord
breake forth moſt gloriouſly: For whenſoever this day of <hi>Iezreel</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,
there muſt be ſuch a glorious work of God as may magnify his name
before the eyes of all men, and therefore at evening it ſhall be light.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And in that day living waters ſhall go out from Jeruſalem:</hi> We have

wherein living waters ſhall even flow out of Jeruſalem.</p>
               <p>Now to winde up all. There is a day for the Saints, a reſt for the people of
God, a day wherein God will deliver them from all afflictions. I have met
with one, that ſpeaking of the Sabbath, that the Jewes might kindle no fire
upon their Sabbath, becauſe that reſt was to ſignifie the reſt of the Saints, he
applyeth it thus: That was (ſaith he) a type that there is ſuch a time of reſt
for the Saints, that they ſhall be delivered from all fiery tryals, all their afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
ſhall be gone and taken away: <hi>Great ſhall be the day of Iezreel.</hi>

their day; come you in and embrace Religion, that you may partake of their

day of all the world, let the world ſtrive againſt them what they can. Every
man deſires to follow the ſtronger party and to cleave to that: would you
cleave to the ſtronger part? Cleave to the Saints of God, to the Church, for
certainly it is the ſtronger part; It is a going up, it is riſing, and will riſe

then. But doeſt thou come now? what ſuperſtitious now? what oppoſing

               <p>Marke that place, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 40. 4. It is ſpoken of the glorious times of the

heart upon all that I ſhal ſhew thee.</hi> And what did God ſhew him? hee

you a bleſſing ſo ſolemnly proclaimed to the reading and hearing of any of
the bookes of God as to that book? Therefore though they are things that
ſeeme to be above us, yet certainly God would have us to inquire into theſe
things. It is the fruit of the purchaſe of the blood of Chriſt to open theſe

This we muſt not diſcourſe of when we meere,<note place="margin">Chap. 2.</note> as matter of newes onely,

about vain and trivial things, when God hath given us ſuch a ſubject of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe

of his mercy towards us in this latter age.</p>
               <q>Say to your brethren Ammi, and to your ſiſters Ruhamah.</q>
               <p>The mercies of God are to be inculcated upon our ſpirits,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> we ſhould not
onely tell them one to another, but again and again inculcate them upon our
hearts. Indeed Gods mercies at firſt they ſeeme to take impreſſion upon
our ſpirits, but the impreſſion is ſoone vaniſhed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Say to your brethren.</hi> This is (according to ſome) Let <hi>Judah</hi> to whom
God ſhewed ſpecial mercy, ſay to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to the ten Tribes that were more
threatned then <hi>Judah,</hi> for <hi>Judah</hi> was not ſo threatned as <hi>Iſrael</hi> was, to be
caſt off from being the people of God. Let <hi>Judah</hi> rejoyce in this, that their
brethren are received again to mercy.</p>
               <p>A gracious heart ſhould rejoyce in Gods mercies towards others.<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> Gods
mercies are an infinite Ocean, there needes no envying there, no grieving
for that which others have. Indeed when one man is richer then another, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
is ready rather to envy him then to rejoyce: A Courier is ready to
envy the favour that another hath, why? becauſe theſe are narrow things.</p>
               <p>But when we come to Gods mercy there is roome enough there, that ſoul
that hath beene made partaker of mercy, counts it a great happineſſe that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

we muſt be ready willingly to take them into brotherly ſociety.</p>

exact diviſion of this no more than we could give of the other. Why? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
things are ſo intermixed; for they are the patheticall expreſſions of a
loving, and yet a provoked husband, and therefore when he is comming to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">

and danger, whilſt he is manifeſting of his diſpleaſure, the bowels of his

middeſt of all; then when he hath had ſome expreſſions of love, he falls a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
to rebuke her and to ſhew her her ſin again, and then his bowels yerne
again, and he commeth to expreſſions of love again. We have found it ſo
in the former Chapter, and ſhall find it ſo in this: For though the beginning
of this Chapter to the 14. <hi>verſe</hi> is ſpecially ſpent in convincing of ſinne and
threatning of Judgement, yet in the ſixth and ſeventh verſes there is promiſe
of mercy and favour, and expreſſions of love, and then in the eighth verſe he
goes to threatning againe, and in the 14. <hi>ver.</hi> begins to expreſs mercy again.</p>
               <p>As God doth in this caſe, ſo ſhould we. When we rebuke others that are
under us, we ſhould ſo rebuke them, as yet to manifeſt love to them, and
when we manifeſt love, to doe it ſo as yet to take notice what is amiſſe and to
reprove them. Many parents know not how to rebuke their children, but
they do it, ſo as that there is nothing but bitterneſſe; and they know not how
to manifeſt their love but they do it ſo as that there is nothing but cockering
and immoderate indulgency. God mixeth both together.</p>
               <q>Say to your brethren, &amp;c.</q>
               <p>Take it for the beginning of the firſt part of this ſecond Chapter, for the
ſhewing of them their ſinne, and rebuking them, What then muſt be the

               </p>
               <p>Then it is carried thus. Some thing muſt be ſupplied for the making up of

God loveth to have people dealt withall in a convincing way, Let not
therefore any thinke it enough either Miniſter or other, that they can ſpeak
terribly to people, and cry out of the ſinnes of the people, but let them la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to convince them, to deale with them as rationall creatures, and to take
away their ſecret objections and their ſecret ſhifts, and to make their ſinnes
plaine before their conſciences. A convincing Preacher and a convincing
Chriſtian is ſuch a one as may be very uſefull, and doe aboundance of good
to the Church of God.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Pleade with your mother.</hi> It is very fit that God ſhould have
ſome to pleade for him,<note place="margin">Obſer. 5</note> to pleade his cauſe as well as the devil hath to pleade
his. The devill never wants pleaders. When was there ever ſuch an ill cauſe
came to a Bench, or to any ſociety in any publique way, but found ſome
that would pleade for it? A ſhame that the worſt cauſe in the world ſhould
have pleaders for it, and many times the cauſe of God ſuffers by mens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mute that ſhould pleade for it. God will take this very ill at their hands.</p>
               <p>It is true, God ſaith, <hi>hee will pleade his owne cauſe,</hi> and wee are bound to
pray according to that of the Pſalmiſt, that <hi>God would ariſe and pleade his
owne cauſe.</hi> And indeed if God had not riſen and pleaded his owne cauſe
better then we did, his cauſe would have been in the dirt before this.</p>
               <p>Though it is true, God is raiſing up his own cauſe, no thanke to us; wee
have cauſe to lay our hands upon our mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>thes as guilty, in that we did ſo
baſely and cowardly let the cauſe of God ſuffer, and God appearing ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
and gloriouſly, is the rebuking of us becauſe we did not, wee
would not before ſtand up to plead<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> his cauſe.</p>
               <p>Sixthly,<note place="margin">Obſer. 6</note> When any have found mercy from God, the ſweetneſſe of that
mercy ſo warmeth their hearts, that they cannot endure to ſee that bleſſed
God be diſhonoured. <hi>Pleade</hi> you <hi>Ammi, Ruhamah;</hi> what, my people,
thoſe to whom I have ſhewed mercy, what though it be your mother, what
though it be any deare to you, what though they be great ones, though they
be a multitude, yet <hi>pleade, plead</hi> for me againſt them, this note is grounded
upon the title that God giveth them who ſhould plead <hi>Ammi,</hi> and <hi>Ruha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mah,</hi>
thoſe that are Gods people, thoſe that have found mercy from God.</p>
               <p>Gods mercy is ſo ſweet, it doth ſo inflame them, that they muſt plead for
God againſt any in the world.</p>
               <p>Seventhly,<note place="margin">Obſer. 7</note> 
                  <hi>Pleade with your Mother.</hi> That is, with the Church, called
a Mother, becauſe as the Mother is as it were the roote from whence chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
come, divideth her ſelfe into branches; ſo the community of
a Commonwealth or a Church, any community, is called in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
a Mother, and the particulars they are as ſeverall branches that growe
from that roote, they are as children. Therefore you have ſuch expreſſions
in Scripture as <hi>the daughters of Jeruſalem</hi> oftentimes, and there is no great
difference between calling <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that is, the State, Mother; or <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi>
that is, the Church, Mother, for indeed the Church and State were
mixed both together. From this expreſſion we learne that it is lawfull for
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:42662:78"/>
children to plead with their parents. Though it is true, this aimeth at a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
thing then what is between natural children and their parents, yet from
the expresſion this is intimated and implied, That it is lawfull for children
to pleade with their parents. If children ſee their parents in an ungodly way,
they may lawfully pleade with them,<note place="margin">Children may plead with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</note> and their parents are bound to hearken
to their pleading Gods cauſe. It is a ſpeech of <hi>Tertullians,</hi> the begetter is to
be beloved, and we may adde, he is to be honoured, but our Creator is to be
preferred.<note place="margin">Amandus Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, ſed praeponen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</note> Children muſt give due reſpect to their parents, yet ſo as prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Lord before them; and if the parents goe againſt God, even their
children muſt plead againſt them. As it is a great ſinne for parents to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
their children before God, ſo it is a great ſin for children to prefer their
parents before God. Do not think I come to ſet children againſt their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
in this, be but content to heare to the end (though I will not be long in
this obſervation) and you will be convinced I ſuppoſe of it, that it is fit for
children to plead with their parents when they go from God.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee it was with <hi>Jonathan, 1 Sam.</hi> 19. 4. there you ſhall finde
that he pleaded with his father when he ſaw him ſo furious and in ſuch a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate
mood as he was in, and in ſuch a cruell way toward poor <hi>David,
Let not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>

                     </gap>he King ſinne againſt his ſervant: Let not the King,</hi> he
gives him very reſpectufll words, and ſheweth his due honour to his father,
<hi>Let not the King ſinne againſt his ſervant,</hi> and then goeth on and tells his
father of the good ſervice <hi>David</hi> had done, and that <hi>David</hi> did not deſerve
ſuch ill uſage from him. Thus when children ſhall ſee their Fathers or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to be in a f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ous rage or pasſion, it is fit enough for them, if they come
in an humble and ſubm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sſive way, in a beſeeching way, I be ſeech you father
or mother, conſider that by theſe diſtempered pasſions, in ſtead of helping
your ſelf, you ſinne againſt God, you have known it by experience that you
have often in ſuch pasſion ſo broken out, that many ſinnes have broken from
you, and you have grieved for it afterwards, oh doe not againe that which
your Conſcience hath ſo often checked you for. If children ſhould come thus
in an humble and ſubmisſive way to plead with their parents, they doe no
more then their duty, and their parents are bound to hearken to them in it.</p>
               <p>I confeſſe they ſhould be very carefull in keeping their due reſpect to their
parents, and not ſpeake mallapertly, but with all reverence and ſubmisſion
to them, and to ſpeak privately too, if posſibly it can be, not to divulge their
parents weakneſſes. You know <hi>Cham</hi> was curſed for diſcovering his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
nakedneſs, though he was drunk he did not ſhew his due reſpect at that
time to his father; but if he had ſought to cover his fathers nakedneſſe, and
after had come and pleaded the caſe with him, certainly he had not beene
curſed, but received a blesſing.</p>
               <p>Yea and there is a great deale of reaſon that children ſhould pleade with
heir parents, and that you ſhould give them leave ſo to doe, becauſe you
know, children are the worſe for your ſinnes, God thr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tneth to <hi>viſit the
ſinnes of the parents upon the children, unto the third and fourth generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:42662:78"/>
there are many threatnings againſt children for the ſinnes of their parents,
therefore it concerns your children that they ſhould plead with you, and that
you ſhould ſuffer them. For you ſay, Sirrah what have you to do with me?
What doth it concern you? Yes, the child if he doth it in modeſty and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
may ſay, O father it doth concern me, I may fare the worſe for your
ſinnes, God may come upon me for them, therefore give me leave I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
you to pleade the cauſe of God with you. And if you will not give
your children leave in this, they may riſe up as witneſſes againſt you ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
day. If children in an humble and ſubmisſive way plead with their
parents, and they will not hearken unto them then, a very good pleading
will be for them to burſt out into teares before their parents, and it is a very
ſutable and powerfull pleading, that when children cannot prevaile in an
humble and ſubmisſive way, then to burſt out into teares before them.</p>
               <p>We read in the ſtory of King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, when <hi>Cranmer</hi> and <hi>Rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>
came to him, and were ſo earneſt to let him give way to his ſiſter the
Lady <hi>Mary</hi> to have Maſſe, he ſtood out and pleaded the caſe with them, &amp;
told them it was a ſinne againſt God, they uſed many carnall arguments to
perſwade the King, but hee withſtood them a great while; at length when
King <hi>Edward</hi> (who was but a childe about 15 years of age) ſaw hee could
not prevaile with pleading againſt thoſe grave men, he burſt out into teares,
and that ſo prevailed with them, that they went away and concluded that
<hi>the King had more Divinity in his little finger, then they had in all their
bodies,</hi> and ſo yeelded to him. Certainly in ſuch pleadings the heart of a
parent muſt needs be much hardned if hee will not breake and yeeld to his
child. You that are parents, looke upon your childrens pleading with you,
and conſider with your ſelves, what doth God ſend one out of my loins, out
of my own wombe to come and plead the cauſe of God with me, to draw
me from the wayes of ſinne, and to do good to my ſoul for ever, ſurely it is
a mercy to have one out of my owne bowels to ſtand for the cauſe of
God; ſurely God is in it, I ſee this child in other things walks humbly and
obediently unto me. As indeed you that are children, that plead with your
parents, you need be carefull ſo much the rather to be obedient to them and
not take upon you in an unſeemly manner to check and reprove them; and
then it cannot but convince the heart of a parent. What a bleſſing will it be
to your children if you that have received your naturall life from your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
ſhould be a means of the ſpiritual and eternal life of them.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the expreſſion. <hi>Plead with your Mother.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for that which is chiefly aimed at, <hi>Plead with your mother,</hi> that is,
the Church and State. Hence the Note is,</p>
               <p>Thoſe that are Godly ſhould not onely ſacrifice themſelves to do good to
themſelves or friends in private,<note place="margin">Obſ. 9.</note> but they are to labour to doe good to the
publique too. Not onely ſay to your ſiſters and to your brethren, but <hi>pleade
with your mother.</hi> There are many narrow ſpirited men, who if they can
diſcharge as they think their conſciences with their families, and can plead
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:42662:79"/>
with their ſervants and children, or ſome of their own neere acquaintance
perhaps, they have done enough, though for the publique they take no care
at all.<note place="margin">We muſt endeavour the good of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique.</note> Hence it is apparently implyed, that all thoſe that are members of
any Church, ought to be men of knowledge; why? becauſe they are ſuch
as are called upon to plead with their Mother. It is not for an ignorant Sot
to plead with a Church of God; and yet ſuch ſhould be all the members of
every Church,<note place="margin">Obſ. 10.</note> as in ſome caſes they ſhould plead with their mother.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, which indeed is the maine Obſervation of all, God giveth liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to ſome private members of Churches,<note place="margin">Obſ. 11.</note> yea it is their duty in ſome caſes
to plead with the whole Church. This we muſt ſpeak unto a little more.</p>
               <p>Gods wayes and his Cauſe are ſo equal, that private Chriſtians, though
they be very weak,<note place="margin">private members may in ſome caſes plead with the whole Church.</note> yet they may be able to plead it with a Church. It is true,
there is a great deale of diſadvantage that a poore, weak, private Chriſtian
hath, when he is to deale with a whole Church, where there are many godly
and learned: but where as there is a diſadvantage one way, ſo the advantage
is as much the other way, in regard that the Cauſe of God is one the one
ſide, and not on the other. The goodneſſe of the Cauſe is as great an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
as the abilities and number on the other ſide is a diſadvantage.</p>
               <p>And ſometimes particular members of a Church have no other way to free
themſelves from the guilt of the ſinnes of the Church, but onely by pleading
with them; except they plead, they are many times inwrapped in the guilt,
and therefore of neceſſity they muſt do it, though they be never ſo weak,</p>
               <p>Yea and ſometimes God hath bleſſed the pleading of ſome few, and of
weak ones too, with a multitude. Perhaps you may have heard of that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Story we have in Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtories of <hi>Paphnutius,</hi> who being
in the Councel of Nice where there were 318. Biſhops, and the buſineſſe
was about the marriage of Miniſters, and generally they caſt againſt it, that
thoſe that were ſingle ſhould not marry: only <hi>Paphnutius,</hi> one man, comes
and plead againſt them all in that caſe, and God ſo wrought it that he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
the Cauſe, and he, one man, convinced all theſe 318. Biſhops. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this is no diſcouragement for one man to ſtand up and plead againſt a
great many.<note place="margin">One man may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt many.</note> So <hi>Petrus Waldenſis</hi> in the Story of <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> though he was
but one at firſt, yet he ſtood againſt many thouſands, and God bleſſed that
which he did for the converſion of thouſands. And <hi>Luther</hi> you know he
ſtood againſt all the world almoſt.</p>
               <p>Yea and though this one man may be but a private man, a weake man.
God may bleſſe that which he ſaith ſometimes more then that which more
learned men ſhall ſay. I remember I have read in the Centuries this Story:
A company of Biſhops being met together, there was a Phyloſopher that
ſtood out againſt the Chriſtian Religion, and ſo reaſoned againſt them all,
that be ſeemed to have the better of it: amongſt them there was one, a very
godly and holy man, but a very weak man; he ſeeing the Cauſe of God like

                  </gap> ſuffer, deſired leave to ſpeak and encounter with this Phyloſopher; all the
reſt being troubled at it, thinking that Gods Cauſe would ſuffer more by
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:42662:79"/>
him, knowing he was a very weak man, but yet knowing withall that hee
was a very holy man,<note place="margin">Hactonus verba au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divi &amp; verba re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dedi, ſed cum divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na virt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondore non potui.</note> none would oppoſe, but let him ſpeak: So he begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
with the Phyloſopher, reciting many Articles of the Faith, Tell me,
ſaith he, do you believe theſe things are ſo? (and ſpoke with Majeſty and
authority) doe not ſo reaſon the caſe about theſe Articles of our Faith, but
do you believe? Preſently the Phyloſopher acknowledged himſelfe over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come:
Hitherto (ſaith he) I have heard words, and returned words, but now
I feel the Divine power, and I cannot further anſwer; and ſo yeelded to be
a Chriſtian upon the pleading of this poor weak man, yet a very holy and
godly man. God hath bleſſed the pleading of weake ones, though it be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
thoſe that are very ſtrong, therefore they muſt not be contemned.</p>
               <p>I remember <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> hath ſuch an expreſſion as this, ſaith hee,

were it but a child ſpeaking with his Spirit, though all the world ſhould be
againſt it. And in <hi>Eſay.</hi> 11. 6. there is a promiſe that in the times of the
Goſpel, the ſpirits of men ſhould be ſo brought down, that they ſhould not
ſtand upon their greatneſſe and learning, but the Text ſaith, <hi>A child ſhould
leade them;</hi> that is, the humble temper that God would have under the
Goſpell.</p>
               <p>But it may be ſaid, Will not this argue ſelf-conceit? What, for one man,
a private man to plead with ſo many, with a Church? it is a ſigne that ſuch
a one is very well opinionated of himſelf, that ſhould think that what he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth
ſhould be ſufficient to ſtand againſt the apprehenſion of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
learned and godly men as are in the Church. How can this be freed from
arrogancy and proud conceitedneſſe.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, Not ſo, it may be conſcience, and not ſelf-conceit, for the rule
of conſcience is not the abilities,<note place="margin">Orcolam padius.</note> nor the holineſſe, nor the multitude of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
but it is that light that God doth let in to convince according to his
Word.<note place="margin">Object. Anſ.</note> Nay further, I ſuppoſe I may convince you that this pleading for
God, may proceed from much ſelf-deniall, and the not pleading may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from very vile, ſinfull ſelf-reſpect.</p>
               <p>How will that appeare?<note place="margin">Queſt. Anſ.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thus. For a private man when he ſees the truth of God to ſuffer, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
if he be an humble and an ingengous ſpirit, it cannot but be exceeding
grievous unto him to think, that he muſt conteſt with ſuch a multitude of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and Godly men,<note place="margin">No pride but ſelfede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal to plead a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſinnes of others.</note> more able then himſelf, it cannot but be to him a very
hard work that God putteth him upon. He would rather a hundred times,
if he did look at his own quiet and eaſe, ſit down: For, think he, if I come
to ſpeak, then by this I ſhall be endangered to be accounted ſelf-conceited,
I ſhall have the accuſation of pride, I ſhall diſpleaſe many of my friends, I
ſhall make a great diſturbance in my ſelf, I am ſure to my own peace, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
I do to others, and how much bette<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> were it for me to ſit ſtill and be
quiet. An humble ſpirit would reaſon thus; but only? Conſcience puts him
upon it; I ſhall contract guilt to my ſelf, if I be not at leaſt a witneſſe for
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:42662:80"/>
Gods truth, therefore though I ſhall ſuffer ſo much in it, yet rather then the
truth ſhall ſuffer, rather then conſcience ſhall plead againſt me, I will plead
though never ſo much to my diſadvantage.</p>
               <p>Now if ſuch an one carry it humbly and quietly, certainly he is rather to
be accounted a ſelf-denying man in it; for it is a very hard taske.</p>
               <p>VVhereas on the other ſide, ſelf-love is more like to think thus; It is true,
theſe things are right, I ſee they are not according to the truth of God.</p>
               <p>Conſcience indeed would have me ſpeak, but I ſhall trouble my ſelf, and
what will they think of me on the other ſide, where there are ſo many able
and godly men? ſurely I ſhall be thought a conceited fool, and therefore
I were as good hold my peace, and ſleepe in a whole skin, and be quiet.</p>
               <p>Thus becauſe they have ſo much ſelf-reſpect, and love their own quiet,
and cannot endure to ſuffer any trouble, they will leave the truth to ſuffer, and
their conſciences to be pleading with in againſt themſelves; rather then thus
to plead for the cauſe of God.</p>
               <p>Certainly they that are charitable ſhould rather take things in the better
part then in the evill. It is true, it is poſſible that men may through pride of
ſpirit be pleading with others (I ſhall ſpeak a word of that by and by) but
yet you may perceive it in the carriage of ſuch a one, in the generall courſe
of his way. Now if in the generall courſe of the way of a man, hee doth
carry himſelfe humbly and ſubmiſſively, that you ſee him yeeldable as
much as ever he can in all lawfull things, and then when he commeth to
plead againſt an evil he is not ſuddain, he is not raſh, and he pleads not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
every light evil neither, but when he comes he comes with a great deale
of trouble in his ſpirit, and carrieth it with all quietneſſe and humility, It is
your rigidneſſe, and that ſpirit which doth not beſeeme a Chriſtian, that is
not the ſpirit of Chriſt in this thing, for to judge of this to be pride. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
under this falſe judge ment the cauſe of God hath ſuffered exceeding
much.<note place="margin">Obj.</note> You will ſay, How can it be imagined, that one man ſhould ſee
more then many, more then others that are able?</p>
               <p>To that I anſwer.<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> In a community where there are many, though they
ſhould be godly, yet many of them may have their ſpirits biaſed with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice,
vvith ſelfe-ends, and ſo not come to ſee the truth though they be
more able.</p>
               <p>Again perhaps though they may be moreable in moſt things, yet in ſome
one God may leave them.<note place="margin">The truth is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſeen beſt where there is greateſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, no nor alwayes where there is moſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> Yea, though they may be more able at other
times, yet for ſome one time God may leave a man in a thing that he is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
able in it another time. And perhaps a great many of them for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
may have ſo much diſtemper of ſpirit, as they may not ſpeak according
to what they think themſelves. Therefore it may be uſefull for ſome one
man to be pleading with many others.</p>
               <p>I beſeech you conſider of this, it is very uſefull. Men muſt not think that
God doth diſpence the knowledge of his truth alwayes according to natural
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>. For want of this conſideration many are led into much evill.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:42662:80"/>
For thus they think with themſelves, If a man have more abilities to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
natural things then others have, therefore he muſt needs have more
abilities to underſtand ſpirituall things then others have. There is a miſtake
in this. A great learned man that hath great abilities, underſtands the rules
of nature, yet a poor weake man may have the mind of Chriſt more then he
hath. For the promiſe is to them that feare God. <hi>Pſal. 25. 14. The ſecret
of the Lord is with them that feare him.</hi> It may be another man hath more
abilities, but this ſpirit may be more ſoild, may be more diſtempered then
the poor weake mans.<note place="margin">Mit. 11. 25</note> 
                  <hi>I thanke thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth,
becauſe thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, and haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
them unto babes; even ſo Father, for it ſeemed good in thy ſight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If multitudes had beene an argument againſt the truth, then in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
times, when Chriſtian Religion began, certainly very few ſhould have
followed JESUS CHRIST. Yea, and there is not more diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
and diſproportion between one or two private members of a Church
and the whole Church, then there was at that time diſadvantage and diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
between the whole Church then and all the world. And if we mark
Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Iohn 5 16.</note> 
                  <hi>We know</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that we are of God, and that the whole world
lyeth in wickedneſſe.</hi> We know. What a ſingular ſpirit was here? here was
ſingularity indeed, if you talke of ſingularity; you are afraid you ſhould be
counted ſelf-conceited, and ſingular in differing from others. <hi>We know that
we are of God, and that the whole world lyes in wickedneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we ſee the thing a little cleared, as this point had need be, but we have
not done with it, we muſt not let it go ſo. There muſt be ſome rules given
for this, or otherwiſe we ſhould wrong the point in naming it.</p>
               <p>Chriſtians may plead, private members may plead with their Mother,
yet they muſt obſerve theſe rules.</p>
               <p>Firſt.<note place="margin">1.</note> They muſt not plead with her for every light thing. For the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
giveth us this rule, That <hi>Love covereth a multitude of infirmi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ies;</hi> We
muſt not ſtand pleading for every infirmity with our brother,<note place="margin">Rules to be obſerved by private Chriſtians who plead with the Church.</note> but rather
paſſe by many and cover them, much leſſe then with the Church.</p>
               <p>But if there be that which is notorious, or if I be called unto it, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
have communion with them, but in my communication with them, I
ſhall be wrapped up in the guilt except I teſtifie the truth. Certainly then
I am bound to plead,</p>
               <p>The ſecond rule is,<note place="margin">2.</note> it muſt be orderly done, that is, if poſſibly it may bee,
you muſt make the Officers of the Church to be your mouth in pleading, I
ſay if it can be. If it come to ſuch a way of rebuking or declaring the evill
to the Church, it ſhould rather (if it can be) be by him whom God hath
appointed to be his mouth to the Church. For you doe it in Gods name,
therefore the moſt orderly way to do it (if it may be done) is by him that
is Gods mouth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It muſt be ſo as you muſt manifeſt all due reſpect to that ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
you are of,<note place="margin">3.</note> to that Church, ſhewing in your carriage, that you are appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:42662:81"/>
and ſenſible even at this time of that diſtance that is betweene you
and that whole ſociety whereof you are a member.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, You muſt do it in a very peaceable way, ſo as to manifeſt that
you deſire peace, and not to be the leaſt diſturbance to the peace of the
Church, but that the peace of it is deare &amp; precious to you. Therefore when
you have witneſſed the truth and diſcharged your conſcience in it, you muſt
be then content to ſit down quiet, for ſo the rule is, <hi>That the ſpirits of the
Prophets muſt be ſubject to the Prophets,</hi> in that caſe: But if it ſhould prove
that the Church ſhould continue, if the evill be notorious and great as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
departing, and the Church after all means uſed &amp; all patience ſhould
continue in it, in ſuch a caſe, you may deſire to be diſmiſſed from it and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part.
But in as peaceable a way as poſſibly can be, yet continuing in due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
unto the Church for all that, though you ſhould depart, onely leaving
your witneſſe behind you. The Papiſts cry out againſt us for pleading a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them, and ſay it is an ill bird that will defile its own neſt, and they tell
us the curſe of <hi>Cham</hi> is upon us for diſcovering our parents nakedneſſe.</p>
               <p>They are to know this, that there is more liberty for a member of a Church
to plead with a Church then for a childe to pleade with his parent. Though
there be liberty for a child, yet there is more liberty for the member of a
Church. For a parent though he ſhould be never ſo evil, yet hee doth not
loſe his right over his childe. Though your parents ſhould be very wicked,
yet know, that their wickedneſſe doth not diſcharge you of your duty; that
all children ſhould take notice of But a Church may ſo fall off from God, as
the members of it may be free from their duty to it, and therefore may have
more liberty to plead then a child with his parent. That but onely in anſwer
to them. And certainly ſo far have they fallen from God, as they have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
thoſe that plead againſt them.</p>
               <p>Well but if a member, a particular may plead with a Church, a whole
Church,<note place="margin">No Officer in a Church member be he never ſo great, but he may be pleaded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt by a private member.</note> with their mother; Certainly then, there is no one Member of a
Church ſo high but he may be pleaded withall, even by private people in that
Church. <hi>Coloſ. 4. 17. Say to Archippus, look to thy Miniſtry,</hi> It is an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation
to all the Church to ſay to Archippus and admoniſh him to looke
to his Miniſtry. For though the officer of a Church be nearer to Chriſt the
head (of which you heard before) then other members are, as the Arme is
nearer the head then the hand; yet if the arme ſhall ſend forth any thing to
the hand that it hath not from the head (as in a flux of putrid humours that
reſteth in the arme) then it would be the ſtrength of the hand to reſiſt thoſe
ill humours that the arme ſends forth. So if any Officer of the Church ſhall
ſend forth that which he did not receive from the head, to any Member, but
ſome putrid humour of his own, It is the virtue of that Member to reſiſt the
receiving of any ſuch humour.</p>
               <p>Certainly it is the pride of many that thinke it ſcorne for any private peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
any way to have to do with them. It is I ſay a pride in men which tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
want of that right order that ſhould be in all Churches is growen to
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:42662:81"/>
that height, that thoſe that take to themſelves as proper the name of <hi>Clergy,</hi>
they think it ſuch a diſhonor to them for any other that is not a <hi>Clergy-man</hi>
(as they ſpeak) to ſpeak to them or admoniſh them of any thing, or to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
with them about any thing, or when they have preached, to come to
them for further ſatisfaction in ſomewhat that they have delivered, or if they
be negligent in their duty, to tell them of it though never ſo ſubmiſſively &amp;
meekly, their pride makes them riſe ſo high.</p>
               <p>And for that obſerve, becauſe they do it upon that ground that they are the
<hi>Clergie,</hi> which ſignifies Gods <hi>inheritance</hi> and Gods <hi>lot,</hi> and ſo contemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
others as inferiour. You ſhall find in Scripture the <hi>people</hi> are called <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy</hi>
in diſtinction from the Miniſters, and never the Miniſters in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> therefore, from whence <hi>Clergy</hi> commeth, is
you ſee attributed to the people. And we ſhall find in Scripture, <hi>Acts</hi> 18.
25. that <hi>Apollos an Eloquent man and mighty in the Scriptures,</hi> and a man
of a <hi>fervent ſpirit,</hi> yet the Text ſaith, that <hi>Aquila and Priſcilla,</hi> that were
private people, <hi>tooke him unto them and expounded to him the way of God
more perfectly.</hi> Where have you an <hi>Apollos</hi> now, an Eloquent man, a Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
a great Clergy man, but would ſcorne and contemne that a poore man
and his wife ſhould take him home &amp; inſtruct him in the way of God more
perfectly? Yet <hi>Apollos</hi> an Eloquent man &amp; mighty in the Scriptures tooke
it well and was willing to receive further inſtruction from theſe people: And
we finde <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. that in the time of reformation of the Church, the Church
went to the <hi>watch-men,</hi> the watch-men <hi>beate</hi> her, ſhee had more reliefe
from <hi>the daughters of Jeruſalem</hi> then from them.</p>
               <p>But we muſt not leave this ſo neither. It is true, there may be a notorious
abuſe of both theſe, and it is exceeding hard for a people to underſtand their
liberty without abuſing of it,<note place="margin">Private people muſt take heed they abuſe not their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</note> either againſt the Church or againſt the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
of a Church. This power may be abuſed in people very much in too
much pride, arrogancy, mallapertneſs, a ſpirit of contention in ſome, taking a
delight in contradiction. There are many people I ſay that are of ſuch a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor
that it is their very delight to be in a way of contradiction, &amp; they think
they are no body except they have ſomewhat to ſay againſt their officers or
againſt what is delivered, and upon that very ground will go quarrelling, not
out of meere conſcience, but that it may appear to others that for their parts
they have a further reach than other men; It is true, ſuch things are deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
generally they are received: yea, but men muſt know that they look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
things further then others doe: And if they be in a community, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:42662:82"/>
that every one would think them no body if they ſtand ſtill and ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
therefore that they may appeare to be ſome-body, they will ſpeake,
they will have ſomewhat to finde fault withall, though they ſcarce under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
what they ſay, or whereof they affirme, and ſhew it they will in a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulent
ſpirit, in a domineering way, and brave it to the faces of thoſe that
God hath ſet over them. Certainly this is a groſſe and abominable thing

                  </gap>er when
God did ſend them a bill of Divorce by ſome extraordinary men (as ever
they had ſome amongſt them, ſome Prophet) or that they did wholly leave
off from being under the pedagogie that God put them under: For I finde
this that their Idolatry was not enough to cut them off from being a Church
actually. It is true their Idolatry was that which did deſerve it. They broke
the marriage bond by their Idolatry, but God did not alwaies take the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of that, hee did not alwaies ſend them a bill of Divorce when they
did commit Idolatry. Theſe ten Tribes had beene Idolaters a long time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God had ſaid to them they were not his wife. Therefore barely Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
did not cut off, no not the Jews. Neither do I think that all Idolatry (if it
be through ignorance) cutteth of a Church now in the time of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.
The Lutherans certainly are guilty of Idolatry by conſequence, and ſo
other Churches may be through ignorance, and yet they not ceaſe to bee
Churches. Therefore in the time of the Jews, I ſay I do not finde any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
ſin that did actually cut them off ſo long as they did keep under the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagogie
of the Law, unleſſe God by ſome extraordinary meſſenger ſent
them a bill of Divorce, they yet remained the people of God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 15. 1.
<hi>Where is your bill of Divorce, ſaith God?</hi> It is true you have deſerved it, but
where is it? I have not given you a bill of Divorce, therefore they were a
Church. But for the time of the Goſpel this I think may very ſafely be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted,
that ſo long as there is a Communion of Saints imbodied, holding
forth the profeſſion of all fundamental truths, and joyning in all Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
ſo far as they are convinced, ſo long there is a Church. Any commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion

and yet perhaps they are not convinced that it is Gods minde they
ſhould ſet it up, though this ſhould be their error, yet this communion of
Saints imbodyed, remaine0th a true Church of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But thus. Though it be a true Church of Chriſt, yet it may be ſuch a Church,
that perhaps you, nor I, nor another cannot have communion withall.</p>
               <p>You will ſay,<note place="margin">A Church may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main a true Church, yet ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt as in ſome caſes we cannot have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with it.</note> How is that poſſible for any Church to be a true Church of

               <p>So far communion we may have as to acknowledge it to be a Church,
and to have communion in ſome duties, but it may be a true Church of
Chriſt, and I may acknowledge it ſo, &amp; yet not have communion in all Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances.
In what caſes may that be?</p>
               <p>Firſt, If this Church ſhall ſo mingle any Ordinance, any work of their
publique communion, as I for the preſent cannot joine without contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Yea ſecondly, If a Church ſhall require me to yeeld in my judgement,
and ſubſcribe to ſuch and ſuch things that I cannot ſatisfie my conſcience in,
they put me off communion with them, it is not my fault, but they violently
keep me off. That is a ſecond caſe.</p>

of me, I cannot have communion with them there neither, becauſe if I ſhould
joine with them, not doing my duty which my conſcience tells me I am
bound to doe, I thereby contract guilt.</p>
               <p>Nay further, A man may be of a Church, and perhaps they may not be

people? Is not repentance too late for this people? No, for all this, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
is not too late for ſuch a people as this, for mark, the Text ſaith in the
15. <hi>ver. And the children of Iſrael ſaid unto the Lord, we have ſinned, do
thou unto us what ſeemeth good unto thee,</hi> and <hi>ver. 16. They put away their
ſtrange gods from among them, and ſerved the Lord.</hi> They do not now lye
downe ſullenly in their ſinnes and ſay, there is no help, therefore we were as
good go on in our ſinfull wayes, but they venture to put away their ſtrange
gods, and crye unto the Lord, and tell him that they had ſinned. What
then? the Text ſaith, <hi>The ſoul of the Lord was grieved for the miſery of
Iſrael.</hi> Though he had thus pronounced againſt them, yet his ſoule was
grieved for them, they were not the ſame they were before.</p>
               <p>It is true, <hi>I will deliver you no more,</hi> you impenitent ones, I will deliver
you no more, but God did not ſay he would not give them repentance;
but when they had put away their ſtrange gods, though they had grieved
Gods Spirit with their ſinnes, yet God was grieved for their affliction
now, and though God had thus threatned them, yet his bowells now
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:42662:85"/>
do yerne towards them, and hee comes in again with mercie; and ſubdues
their enemies under them, the children of <hi>Ammon</hi> were conquered, and
God gives them twenty of their Cities, as <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. 33.</p>
               <p>God never threatneth any people, but the condition of mercie upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
it is either expreſſed, or implyed. It is therefore the frowardneſs
and the fulneſs of the hearts of ſinners, to give over all upon the thought of
the greatneſs of their ſins, or the ſeverity of Gods threatning againſt them,
O no, you great ſinners, that have beene guilty of many horrible ſins, come
in and repent, I may ſay to you as <hi>Secaniah</hi> did to the people in another caſe,
of a grievous ſin, <hi>Ezra. 10. 2. There is hope in Iſrael concerning this thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is the cavill of many carnal hearts againſt many faithfull and Zealons
Miniſters, that they do nothing but preach judgement, and they threaten
damnation, and ſay people ſhall be damned, and go to hell, aud the like.</p>
               <p>This they ſpeak againſt them, not mentioning at all the conditions upon
which damnation and hell is threatned. Certainly there can ſcarce a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
in the world be found that threatneth damnation or hell abſolutely, but
upon thoſe termes of impenitency. I will give you one Scripture to ſhew
you the moſt abſurd perverſe ſpirits of men in this kinde, how they will take
a piece of the words of the Prophets and ſeparate the threatning from the
condition, on purpoſe that they may cavill at the word, it is in <hi>Jer.</hi> 26. 4.
ſaith God to the Prophet there, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſay to them, Thus ſaith the
Lord, If you will not hearken to me to walke in my Law which I have ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                  <hi>then will I make this houſe like Shiloh, and will make their Citie
a curſe to all the nations of the earth.</hi> See how fairely the words of the
Prophet go, <hi>If you will not hearken to me to walke in my lawes, and the
words of my Prophets whom I ſent unto you,</hi> then I will do ſo and ſo. The
Prophet delivers his meſſage as faire as can be. But ſee now their perverſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in the 8. <hi>ver. It came to paſſe that when Jeremiah had made an end
of ſpeaking all that the Lord commanded him to ſpeake unto all the people,
that the Prieſts and the Prophets and all the people tooke him, ſaying, Thou
ſhalt ſurely dye.</hi> What is the matter? <hi>Why haſt thou Prophecyed in the
name of the Lord, ſaying. This houſe ſhall be like Shiloh?</hi> They leave out,
[<hi>if,</hi>] whereas he ſaid, <hi>If you will not return and heare the words of the Lord,
this houſe ſhall be as Shiloh;</hi> They come and lay hold upon him with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
<hi>Why haſt thou ſaid this houſe ſhall be like Shiloh?</hi> and leave out the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
This is the perverſeneſs of the hearts of men.</p>
               <p>Well then, the concluſion of this Obſervation is this, that the worſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
againſt any for their ſinnes, it is not to ſinke the hearts in deſpaire, but
to turne their hearts towards God that they may receive mercy; <hi>Let her
put away her whoredomes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Let her put away her whoredomes.</hi> After ſuch a kinde of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that included a moſt dreadfull threatning in it, <hi>She is not my wife,</hi> yet
God exhorteth. Hence the Obſervation is this.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:42662:85"/>
While God is pleaſed to ſpeak to a people and call upon them, and exhort
them to turne unto him,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> the condition of that people is not deſperate. Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
from God do argue that the condition of a people may be hopefull.</p>
               <p>So long as the King is but ſpeaking to a Traytor, eſpecially giving of him
good counſel,<note place="margin">While ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation continues there is hope.</note> there may be hope: If he turne his backe upon him, and will
ſpeake no more, then he looks upon himſelf as a gone man. Many people
are troubled that God doth ſo continue exhorting by his Miniſters and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and they cannot be at quiet. If thou haſt ſuch a quiet as God ſhould
leave exhorting and drawing thee from thy ſinnes, woe to thee, thou art a
loſt creature. Make much of exhortations and threatnings.</p>
               <p>Come we now to the Exhortation it ſelfe, <hi>Let her put away her whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
out of her ſight, and her adulteries from betweene her breaſts.</hi> It is
in the plurall number, <hi>her whoredomes,</hi> and <hi>her adulteries.</hi> They were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
ſhee muſt put them away all. If a wife that hath been naught ſhall be
contented to forſake divers of her lovers and retain but one there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation,
all her adulteries muſt be put away.</p>
               <p>But the words are not onely in the plurall number, but thoſe that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the Originall, well know, that there is ſomewhat in the words to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the ſignification beyond the plurall number, and that is the duplication
of the radicall letter, in the firſt word the ſecond radicall letter which is [<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>] that is double.</p>
               <p>It is the note of <hi>Tarnovius</hi> upon the place, ſaith he, the doubling of theſe
radicall Letters ſhew the exceeding multitude of thoſe whordomes and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulteries
that Iſrael was guilty of at this time. And indeed when once there
is giving way to ſuperſtitious vanities there is growing to notorious whor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
and adulteries without meaſure, without number, <hi>ubi ſiſtendum.</hi>
We never know where to ſtop, if once our worſhip be corrupted.</p>
               <q>Let her put away out of her ſight.</q>
               <p>The eye is the receiver of much uncleanneſs into the heart, and by it the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanueſs
of the heart is much expreſt. The Scripture ſpeakes of eies full of
adulterie, <hi>Let her put her adulteries out of her ſight,</hi> let them be abominable
now in her eies, thoſe things that before were delectable, let them now bee
deteſtable. Let them caſt away their Idols as a <hi>filthy menſtruous cloath,</hi>
and with indignation ſay, <hi>get yee hence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or <hi>from before her face,</hi> ſo it is in the Hebrew, noting her impudency in
her idolatry, that it appeared in her very face. Though men at firſt may be
a little wary, yet at length they grow to manifeſt outwardly their Idolatry in
their very face. But what we ſhall meet with afterward.</p>
               <p>And becauſe <hi>Iſrael</hi> did not according to the exhortation of thoſe that
pleaded with her, put thus her whordomes out of her ſight, God did put <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>
out of his ſight, for ſo we have it, 2 <hi>King. 17. 22. 23. The children of
Iſrael walked in all the ſinnes of Jeroboam which he did, they departed not
from them.</hi> Promiſes could not draw them, threatnings could not derer
them. <hi>Vntill the Lord removed Iſrael out of his ſight.</hi>

hath an excellent note from thence. God (ſaith he) threatneth that he will
take away her whoredomes from his face; as when a member of a body is
ſo putrified that it cannot be cured by ſalves and medicynes, it is cut off, and
ſo the diſeaſe commeth to be cured: ſo God laboureth to cure the people
of Iſrael by admonitions, by exhortations, by threatnings, by promiſes of
mercy, and when all would not do, then he threatneth to cure them by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way, that is, by cutting them off by the <hi>Aſſyrians;</hi> I will ſend an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
againſt them and he ſhall take them out of their owne land, and carry

far enough from <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> ſo I will take their whoredomes from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

from thy ſinnes, to take away thy ſinnes from thee; that will not do; God
commeth with ſome noyſome vile diſeaſe upon thy body that thou ſhalt not
be able to act thy ſinne any more, and God takes away the act of thy ſinne
at leaſt that way in ſuch a violent manner by his judgements: and ſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
men and women that have eſtates, and will be proud, and vaine, and
make their eſtates the fuel of their luſts, when the Word cannot take away
their ſinnes and the expreſſion of their wickedneſſe, God by ſome violent
judgement takes away their eſtates, that they ſhall not be able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit

This is a dreadfull taking away of ſin. Yea when God ſhall come ſo to
take away the ſinne of men and women as to take away their ſouls together
with taking away their ſinne: for ſo it is threatned, <hi>Job. 27. 8. What is
the hope of the hypocrite when God taketh away his ſoul?</hi> Thou that woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
not ſuffer the word to take away thy ſin, thou muſt expect that God wil

(ſaith the Text) <hi>when their iniquity ſhal have an end.</hi> God will ſuffer them
to live no longer to ſin againſt him: he will take away their ſinnes, but ſo
as to take away their ſoules, they ſhall not ſinne any more againſt God in

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Why the <hi>Amorite</hi> and <hi>Hittite</hi> rather then others?</p>
               <p>For the firſt, <hi>the Amorite;</hi> becauſe the <hi>Amorite</hi> was the chiefeſt of thoſe
nations in <hi>Canaan</hi> that were driven out. All the five were called by the
name of <hi>Amorite: The ſinnes of the Amorites are not yet full.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly <hi>the Hittite,</hi> becauſe they ſeemed to be the vileſt of the five, and
for that, there is a Text of Scripture that ſeemeth to infer ſo much. <hi>Gen.</hi> 27.
46. <hi>I am weary of my life</hi> (ſaith <hi>Rebekah) becauſe of the daughters of
Heth.</hi> She onely mentioneth the daughters of <hi>Heth,</hi> and thoſe that were
now called <hi>Hittites</hi> were of the daughters of <hi>Heth:</hi> And ſaith ſhe, <hi>What
good will my life doe, if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth?</hi> Why,
there were other daughters beſides them, but thoſe were the vileſt, therefore
ſhe onely mentioneth them.</p>
               <p>Yea, but what was <hi>Iſrael</hi> at this time when they were delivered out of
Egypt (for that is the time wherein ſhee was borne that is ſpoken of here)
were they in ſo ill a condition, as that their <hi>father</hi> was an <hi>Amorite</hi> and their
<hi>mother</hi> an <hi>Hittite</hi> at that time?</p>
               <p>There are two moſt uſefull Obſervations that flow from hence, before we
proceed any further in the explication of the words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iſrael</hi> though they had been 400. years in Egypt under grievous afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
yet they continued exceeding abominable and wicked. The fire of
their affliction did ſeeme to harden their hearts, as much as the fire of the
furnace did harden the bricks: Their hearts were clay, foule, dirty hearts,
and were hardned by their afflictions.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> when God came to deliver <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of Egypt, God
found them to be in a very wicked condition then; then their <hi>Father</hi> was
an <hi>Amorite,</hi> and their <hi>mother</hi> an <hi>Hittite,</hi> then they were thus vile when
God came to deliver them, in the day wherein they were borne, (for their
deliverance is their birth.)</p>
               <p>Oh the freeneſſe of Gods grace! God often told them that his grace was
free,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> and ſo indeed it was if hee found them thus as he did, for ſo you ſhall
finde if you read the ſtory of the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that when God ſent <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
unto them, they were a very wicked and ſtubborn people, even at that
very time when God came with his deliverance.</p>
               <p>Let us then raiſe up our hearts and looke up to the free grace of God even
toward us. We are vile, we are wicked, mercies, chriſtiſements have hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
us; and yet all this hindreth not the free grace of God for the deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of a people. God hath begun in a way of deliverance to us; and when
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:42662:88"/>
did he begin it?<note place="margin">Lect. 1.</note> Certainly England was never ſince it was borne, ſince it
was delivered out of ſpiritual Egypt, out of the bondage of Popery, it was
never in a worſe condition then when God came in with his mercies of late
to us: Then if ever it might be ſaid of us that <hi>our father was an Amorite,
and our mother an Hittite,</hi> we were then in the very high way towards E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt
again when God came with his free grace to deliver us. As hee dealt
with his own people, ſo he hath dealt with us, magnified be the free grace of
God towards us an unworthy people.</p>
               <p>Further, <hi>Thy Navill was not cut.</hi> That is the expreſſion how he was in
the day wherein he was borne.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Thy navil was not cut,</hi> what is the meaning of that.</note> 
                  <hi>Thy Navill was not cut,</hi> The loathſomeneſſe of their condition is
ſet out by that. Naturalliſts obſerve that the nouriſhment that the childe
hath from the mother, it is by the navill: as afterward the childe ſucks of
the breaſts and ſo is battned, but all the while it is in the wombe, it is nour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed
by a ſtring, in the navill that draws nouriſhment from the mother.</p>
               <p>Now Iſrael even when God did deliver them from Egypt, had not their
<hi>navill cut,</hi> that is, they did even ſtill ſeeme, nay, not only ſeeme but ſtill they
did draw their nouriſhment from Egypt; they did batten themſelves &amp; ſuck
out the Egyptian manners, and cuſtomes, and ſuperſtitions; and in their
growth up they did ſeeme rather to have their nouriſhment from Egypt
then from God, ſo God himſelfe chargeth them, <hi>Ezek. 23. 8. Neither left
ſhe her whoredomes brought from Egypt,</hi> ſaith the Text, <hi>her navill was not
cut,</hi> ſhee drew, ſhe ſucked ſtill the Egyptian manners, cuſtomes, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions.</p>
               <p>It is not thus in part with us? Let me a little ſpeake of this by way of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion
at leaſt. Is our navill cut to this very day? It is true, God hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
us from Popery, from Egypt, as he did Iſrael, but ſtill do not we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
ſucking, drawing nouriſhment from our old ſuperſtitious wayes of
Popery? we ſeeme to live ſtill upon them, and to have our hearts delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in them. Oh how juſt were it with God to come in a violent way and cut
our navill, even by the ſword! it is mercy he commeth not thus to cut it, and
ſo to take from us all thoſe ſecret hankerings that wee have after the old E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian
cuſtomes.</p>
               <p>Yet again, ſeeing it is ſuch a full alluſion, wee may apply it to thoſe that
ſeeme to have a new birth to be borne again, thoſe that ſeeme now to make
very faire profeſſion of Religion, and to forſake many evill wayes that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
they have delighted in: but yet their navill is not cut neither; they do
ſecretly ſuck ſweetneſſe and battning from their former luſts; the <hi>curſe of the
ſerpent</hi> is upon them, <hi>upon their bellies they doe goe and duſt they do eate,</hi>
their bellies do even cleave to the duſt. <hi>Neither waſt thou waſhed in water.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This alſo ſets forth the wofull condition of Iſrael when he was borne, he
was not waſhed. The infant when it commeth firſt into the world, cometh
from blood and filth in which it was wrapped, that (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſaith) it is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

were it not that there were a natural affection ſtirring in parents, they would

their bodily eyes, but there is more polution in their ſoules; they are wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
up in original ſin and filth, more then their bodyes are wrapped up in
blood and filth in the wombe.</p>
               <p>Therefore infants are waſhed, but <hi>thou waſt not waſhed,</hi> thou waſt let goe
in thy filth. I have read of the Lacedemonians, that when their children
were borne, they uſed to throw them into the river, to conſolidate their
members and parts of their bodies, as they ſay, to make them ſtrong, that
was the cuſtome of that barbarous people.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thou waſt caſt out in the open field.</hi> What is the meaning of this? We
cannot underſtand it fully without examining what the cuſtome of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
was in thoſe times. We finde in Hiſtories that the cuſtome of divers of
the Heathen was, when their children were borne, to obſerve by their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
by the making of their members, whether they were like to be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to the Commouwealth or not; and if not like they threw them away, and
if they were like to be uſefull they nouriſhed them up. They nouriſhed up
no other children but thoſe that they judged by their countenance or mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
would do good to the Common-wealth: We finde it in divers Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
<hi>Strabo</hi> tells us that the Indians and Brachmanes had certaine Judges

               <p>So that the holy Ghoſt alludeth to the way of the Gentiles and barbarous
people, and telleth Iſrael that they were as a childe caſt out, ſuch a one as the
countenance and feature promiſed no good, <hi>Thou wert caſt out in the open
field,</hi> becauſe they never hoped to have any good of thee, and indeed (as if
God ſhould ſay) if I had regarded what I ſaw in you, I might have paſt
this judgement upon you too, there was little hope of good from you. But
what though the child be caſt out in the field, yet there may come ſome by,
accidentally (as <hi>Pharaohs</hi> daughter did) that may pitty the child, and have
compaſſion on it. No (ſaith God) thou waſt not onely <hi>caſt out,</hi> but worſe
then ſo, thou waſt caſt out, and ſo caſt out as <hi>no eye pityed thee.</hi> You have

in baskets &amp; otherways, yet when you open them &amp; ſee a child, and a childe
weeping, there is ſome pity in you, and you will take care ſome way or other
that it may be fed &amp; brought up. But ſaith God to Iſrael, <hi>You were caſt out

               <p>Now ſee what ornaments God had put upon them. They were in a ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
condition you ſee when they were borne. But marke, that fore-named
place of <hi>Ezek. ver. 8. I took the</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>and entred into covenant with

Gods, his <hi>entring into covenant</hi> with them. The Lord hath begun to enter
into Covenant with us, and we with him in former <hi>Proteſtations,</hi> and if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
farther Covenant binding us more ſtrictly to God be tendred to us, know
that God in this deals with us as he did with his own people. We are as chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
caſt out in the open field, and no eye pityeth us; but many plot againſt
us, and ſeeke our ruine. If God will be pleaſed now to enter into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with us, and give all the people of the Land hearts to come cloſe to the
Covenant, to renew their Covenant with him, and that to more purpoſe
then in former Covenants, the Lord yet will own us. The Covenant of God
was the foundation of all the mercy the people of Iſrael had from God, and
we are to look upon it as the foundation of our mercy; and therefore as in
the preſence of God willingly and cheerfully to renew it with him.</p>
               <p>After Gods taking this people to himſelfe as his own, it followes. <hi>ver.</hi> 11,

and a chaine on thy necke; And I put a jewell on thy fore-head, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
in thine ears, &amp; a beautiful crown upon thine head. Thus waſt thou
decked with gold and ſilver, and thy rayment of fine linnen, and ſilk &amp; broi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
worke, and thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty.</hi>
Thus God did with the people of Iſrael, he had added to what they had when
they were born. Miſerable they were when they were borne; but the mercies
of God toward them are thus ſet out, And nowhee cometh to threaten that
he will ſtrip them naked and ſet them as in the day wherein they were born.</p>
               <p>Yet further for the opening of this, we muſt know that it was the cuſtome
among the Jews, when any married, what they brought to their husbands,
and their dowry was written down in a table: and if afterward he ſhould di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce
his wife, except there could be proved ſome groſſe and vile thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the woman, though ſhe ſhould go away, yet ſhe was to go away with
her Table, with her dowry and what ſhe brought, ſhe muſt not goe away
naked. But if there could be proved ſome notorious villany that ſhee had
committed, then ſhe was ſent away <hi>Sine Tabulis,</hi> naked without thoſe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
wherein her dowry and other things were written, and deſtitute of all
things, as being unworthy of them, becauſe ſhe had played the harlot.</p>

The firſt is, The beginnings of great excellencies are ſometimes very low
and meane. This plainly riſeth up from the oppoſition of her condition when
ſhe was borne, and what ſhe had gotten from God afterward, <hi>I will ſtrip
thee naked and ſet thee as in the day wherein thou wert borne.</hi> Therefore it
is cleare ſhe was born in a very mean condition, &amp; gotten up to a very excel
lent condition, though now they be high &amp; glorious, yet once they were very
low &amp; mean. God many times raiſes up golden pillars upon leaden Baſes, &amp;
the moſt glorious works of God have had the loweſt beginnings. This beauti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full frame of heaven &amp; earth was raiſed out of a Chaos of confuſion &amp; dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
This is true, perſonally, or nationally, and that in regard of outward
conditions or ſpirituall. How poor, and low, and meane, have many of your
beginnings beene even in the world? who could ever have thought that
ſuch low beginnings could have beene raiſed unto ſuch high things as ſome
of you have beene raiſed unto in the world? It was not long ſince when you
came hither to this City (which may be ſaid to be the day wherein you were
borne for your civill eſtate, though not your naturall) you were low enough,
meane enough, you had but little to begin withall; you came hither <hi>with
your ſtaffe,</hi> and <hi>now behold two bands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is ſometimes ſo likewiſe in regard of the ſpirituall eſtate. You may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
not long ſince, Oh what darkneſs and confuſion was there in your
mindes and hearts; what poore, low, meane thoughts had you of God and
the things of his Kingdome, what unſavory ſpirits, when at firſt God was
pleaſed to worke upon you? Oh what a poor condition were you in then?
though you had ſome light put into you, yet you were as a childe new borne
wrapped up in filth and blood, many noyſome diſtempers and boiſterous
luſts there were in your hearts, as it is uſuall with new converts, like a fire
newly kindled where there is a great deale of ſmother and ſmoke that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
weareth away. But now behold the ſhining of Gods face upon your
ſoules, Oh the abilities that God hath given you to know his minde and doe
his will! Oh the bleſſed communion that you have with God, &amp; the ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of that divine nature! the glory and beauty of the divine nature is put u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon

               <p>How low and meane were we at firſt? we were a moſt rude, barbarous,

or flock-bed, or a ſack of chaffe to reſt his head on, he thought himſelfe
as well lodged as the Lord of the Towne, for ordinarily they lay upon ſtraw
pellets covered with canvace, and a round log under their heads inſtead of a
bolſter, they ſaid pillows were fit onely for women in child-bed, and in a
good Farmers houſe it was rare to finde foure pieces of pewter, and it was
accounted a great matter that a Farmer could ſhew five ſhillings or a noble
in ſilver together. And <hi>Camden</hi> in his <hi>Britania</hi> tells of Ailesbury a Towne
in Buckinghamſhire, that there was in it a Mannour of the Kings, and the
condition of holding certain lands there, was, that the poſſeſſor or holder of
them ſhould find ſtraw for litter of the Kings bed when he came there, And

               <p>It is the moſt ſordid, miſerable ſlavery that it is poſſible for a rationall
creature to be under, not onely to be bound to practice, but to be bound to
beleeve for truth the dictates and determinations of men, yea and that upon
paine of eternall damnation, to beleeve what they ſay, as the Articles of
Faith upon which Salvation or Damnation depends, for Conſcience to be
under them, ſo as I muſt not queſtion or ſcruple any thing; if any man that
is a rationall creature ſhould think there is any ſuch diſtance between man
and man, he debaſeth himſelf beneath a man, and advanceth the other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
a man. Better it is to be in ſlavery to another to ſcrape kennels, then
to be in this ſlavery. And to have the Scriptures kept from us, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle
that God hath ſent from heaven to us, that which enlightens the world,
revealing the great counſels of God concerning eternal life; this is worſe

<pb n="177" facs="tcp:42662:90"/>
no Ordinances but according to the luſts and humours of vile men,<note place="margin">Lect. 1.</note> how
great a ſlavery is this? The manifeſtation of the leaſt ſuſpition of the falſnes
of the vileſt errors, diſlike of the baſeſt practices, was enough to confiſcate
eſtate, to impriſon, yea to take away life. Was not this a low condition, a
baſe ſlavery that England was in? could any beare it but ſuch as were ſlaves
to their own luſts? But now what ornaments hath God put upon us!</p>
               <p>No Nation under heaven more renowned then wee have beene, our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown
hath gone thorough the earth, England, O <hi>Angliquaſi Angeli,</hi> and
<hi>Albion,</hi> from our happineſſe, we ſee now (by our ſelves) that glorious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies
have many times low beginnings.</p>
               <p>A ſecond obſervation hence is,<note place="margin">Obſ. 2.</note> when we have any excellency, and beauty
upon us, it is Gods mercy that is all our beauty. <hi>I will ſtrip you naked and
ſet you as in the day wherein you were born.</hi> If you have any excellency it is
my mercy. Gods mercie is a peoples beauty and glory, We have nothing
belonging to us but ſhame and confuſion, but miſery, if we have any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments,
it is mercy, free mercy: therefore in the 14. <hi>ver.</hi> of that 16. <hi>Ezek.
Thou wert perfect in beauty,</hi> How? <hi>through my comlineſſe which I had put
upon thee, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Let God take away but his mercy, we are quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
left naked, and poor, and miſerable; like the ragged walls in the Court
when the King goeth away, and all the rich hangings are taken down, what
a difference is there in their look from what was formerly? the beauty of
the walls were the hangings when the King was there. So if wee have any
thing that makes us beautifull, they are the hangings that God hath put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us; his mercies are thoſe hangings of gold, and ſilver, and needle-work,
and when they are gone, we are poor, and ragged, and miſerable.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Obſ. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Leſt I ſtrip her naked, &amp;c.</hi> God had ſaid before that ſhe was
<hi>not his wife,</hi> ſhe was guilty of whoredoms, yet it ſeemes ſhee was not yet
<hi>ſtripped naked;</hi> ſhe was left with Gods <hi>ornaments</hi> upon her, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
her whoredoms. Hence the third Obſervation is,</p>
               <p>Though ſinners deſerve great evils, to be ſtripped of all comforts, yet God
in patience and clemencie continueth them a long time. They may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
fearfull threatnings, and yet retaine many comforts; yea the truth is, it
is poſſible for a people to be caſt off from God, &amp; yet to continue for a while
in outward proſperity. The tree that is cut up by the roots, yet may have the
leaves green for a while. <hi>Saul</hi> who was rejected of God, 1 <hi>Sam,</hi> 13. 14, yet
after that (if you reade the Story you ſhall finde it) that God ſuffered <hi>Saul</hi>
to proſper exceedingly in overcomming the <hi>Phyliſtims</hi> &amp; the <hi>Amalekites</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Obſ. 4.</note> The mercies that God beſtoweth upon a Nation, the ornaments
that God putteth upon a people that are but common favours, not ſpirituall
graces, they are ſuch as a people may be ſtripped of. Great mercies that a
people have, they may wholly looſe. Here is the difference between true
ſpirituall graces, whereby JESUS CHRIST doth adorne his ſpouſe,
when Chriſt, not onely takes in an outward way a people to himſelfe, but
marries them to himſelf in a ſpirituall way, he decketh the ſoule with ſuch
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:42662:91" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ornaments,<note place="margin">Lect. 2.</note> beſtoweth ſuchmercies upon them, as ſhall never be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.
Such a ſoul hath no cauſe to feare that ever it can be ſtripped as in the
day wherein it was born, you need not feare that you ſhall ever loſe the
jewels given you at that marriage day. It is true, common graces and gifts
you may be ſtript of and made naked; as it is uſuall in many profeſſors that
have not truth at heart, yet have excellent gifts, as of prayer and the like, but
afterward they prove naught, God takes away their gifts from them, they
have not that gift of prayer they were wont to have, though they have excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
words, yet a man may perceive a ſhuffling in them, and ſuch an unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorineſs
mixed with their gifts, that it breeds loathing in others to joyne with
them. As when the King goeth away from his Pallace, the hangings are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
down; ſo when God departeth from a ſoul (as from ſuch he may) then
their hangings, thoſe excellent gifts are taken from them. But thoſe gifts
that are ſpirituall they are never ſtripped of them. We read in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 46. 17.
when <hi>a King gave gifts to his ſervants,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gifts of hypocrites will vanish</note> 
                  <hi>they were to returne to him againe
at the yeere of Jubilee, but when he gave them to his ſonnes, they were to be
their inheritance.</hi> There are many that are outwardly in the Church Gods
ſervants, they have many gifts, but God will take them away and ſtrip them
naked of thoſe gifts: but then there are his children, they ſhall have their
gifts as an inheritance for ever. It is true, God may ſtay a while, as when the
King is gone from Court, if there be any thought of his returne again the
hangings do continue, but if the meſſage come, the King will not be here
this twelve moneths, or a long time, or it may be never any more, then the
hangings are taken down; ſo though theſe gifts of the Hypocrite may ſtay
a while,<note place="margin">Obſ. 5.</note> yet they will vaniſh at laſt. The fifth Obſervation.—</p>
               <p>Continuance in ſinne, and eſpecially the ſin of ſpirituall whoredome, is
that which will ſtrip a Nation from all their excellencies, from all their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and beauty; the continuance in that ſin eſpecially; for ſo the words
imply, <hi>Let her pnt away her adulteries from between her breaſts, leſt I ſtrip
her naked. &amp;c.</hi> If ſhe continue thus, certainly naked ſhe ſhall be.</p>
               <p>This alwayes brings nakedneſſe meritoriouſly, but if continued in, effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually,
it makes them naked. <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 25. You may ſee there what made
the people naked at that time, the Text ſaith, that <hi>Aaron had made the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
naked,</hi> that is, <hi>Aaron</hi> by conſenting to the people to make the Calfe had
made the people naked: <hi>naked,</hi> that is deſtitute now of Gods gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
deprived of thoſe favours from God that formerly they had. And as
the Prieſt had made them naked, ſo you may finde it in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. 19.
that the King made them naked too. <hi>The Lord brought Judah lowe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of Ahaz King of Iſrael, for he made Judah naked and tranſgreſſed
ſore againſt the Lord.</hi> He <hi>made Judah naked,</hi> that is by countenancing I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry,
by ſyding with thoſe that were Idolaters, even he made Judah na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
at that time.</p>
               <p>Here we may ſee who they are that are like to ſtrip us, if ever God ſhould
come to ſtrip us. We have many amongſt us that ſee falſe burthens of all the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:42662:91"/>
miſeries and troubles that come upon the nation; they cry out preſently of
the Puritans, and of others that they ſay are factious and ſeditious ſpirits,
and turbulent,<note place="margin">Who they are that bring evill upon the nation.</note> and all muſt be laid upon them. Certainly whoſoever hath
eyes in his head may eaſily ſee who makes us thus naked as we are, and if we
be made more naked, who will be the cauſe of all? Thoſe that ſtand againſt
the way of Reformation, thoſe that will keep their whoredoms in their ſight,
and their adulteries between their breaſts, thoſe that will not be willing that
the Church ſhall be purged from that filth and whoriſh attire that it hath;
theſe are they that make us naked. We read in <hi>Lamen. 2. 14. Thy Prophets
have ſeene vaine and fooliſh things for thee, and they have not diſcovered
thine iniquity to turne away thy captivity; but have ſeen for thee the falſe
burthens, and cauſes of baniſhment.</hi> Mark it, <hi>the Prophets have ſeene vaine
a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

<hi>captivity,</hi> but they <hi>have ſeene for them falſe burthens and cauſes of baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
The Prophets ſay it is a company of theſe preciſe and ſtrict ones, that
will not be obedient to authority, and will not doe what is commanded in
ſuch and ſuch things, and (when there were wayes of corruption in Gods
worſhip) they would not ſubmit to ſuch and ſuch orders. The Prophets lay
the blame upon them, but <hi>they ſee falſe burthens,</hi> ſaith the Text, <hi>and falſe
canſes of baniſhment.</hi> We have many ſuch Prophets amongſt us who ſee
falſe burthens and cauſes of baniſhment, and they cry out of thoſe that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
are the cauſes of our peace and of the good of the kingdom. <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
tells us that in the Primitive times, if they had but any ill weather, or any
trouble at all, they would cry out of the Chriſtians as the cauſe of it, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
the voice was, <hi>Adleons,</hi> let the Chriſtians be dragged to the Lyons,
and devoured by the Lyons; it hath beene ſo amongſt us. But may we not
anſwer as <hi>Elijah</hi> anſwered <hi>Ahab,</hi> when <hi>Ahah</hi> told him that he was the
man that troubled Iſrael, <hi>I have not troubled Iſrael, but it is thou and thy
fathers houſe.</hi> May we not well ſay to them as <hi>Jehu to Iehoram</hi> when hee
asked him whether there was peace, <hi>What peace ſo long as the whoredomes
of thy mother Iezebel and her witchcrafts are ſo many?</hi> Thoſe have been
popiſh, certainly they have endangered us of being ſtripped of all. Who
were the cauſers of the firſt diſturbances amongſt us, even of all the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
here of Gods Saints, and of all the diſcontent among the people? Who
were they that perſwaded the bringing in of an Arbitrary vvay of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
Who were the cauſe of laying ſuch things upon the people that they
could not beare? Who were the cauſers of the troubles in Scotland, &amp; ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of bookes thither full of ſuperſtitious vanities? was it not the Prelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
faction? Who are thoſe that hinderthe Reformation at this day? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
if it were as apparent that they that are called Puritans had been the
cauſe of ſuch charge to the Kingdom &amp; diſturbances to the State as the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latical
faction hath been; it had been impoſſible for them to go in the ſtreets
but they would have been ſtoned to death.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:42662:92"/>
I ſpeake not this as though we ſhould do the like,<note place="margin">Lect. 1.</note> but I ſpeake it to ſhew
what the virulencie of their ſpirits would have beene to them if it had beene
apparent that they had beene ſuch charge to the Kingdome, and ſuch diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the State. The truth is, vve may charge our Papiſts, and charge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that are of that way) and we know who are next to them) we may well
charge them as the cauſe of ſtripping of us naked as we have been.</p>
               <p>It is cleere enough, thoſe that put not away their whoredoms from them,
but continue ſtill ſuperſtitious and Idolaters, they are they that endauger a
people to be ſtripped naked.</p>
               <p>A ſixth Obſervation that preſents it ſelfe fully and cleerely without any
the leaſt ſtraining,<note place="margin">Obſer. 6.</note> is, That it is time for people then to pleade, when there is
danger of deſolation. <hi>Plead with your mother, plead,</hi> why ſo? why ſhould
we not be quiet? <hi>Leſt I ſtrip her naked and ſet her as in the day wherein
ſhe was borne.</hi> What, you are in ſuch a condition as you are in danger to be
ſtripped naked and to be left deſolate as a <hi>wilderneſſe</hi> (as it followeth in the
Text) Is it not time then to plead? Oh pleade with God, and pleade with
thoſe that are in authority, and plead one with another, and pleade with all,
ſtirre up your ſelves and do what you can;<note place="margin">It is time for every one to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in times of danger.</note> let there be no ſluggiſh ſpirit, no
neutralizing ſpirit. It is not time for any to be newters now. It is time now for
all to come and plead, not ſo much time now to diſpute of things, but now
time for every one to ſtand, and appear, &amp; plead, not only verbally, but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
as God calls them to it. <hi>Luke</hi> 3. 9. When <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>The axe is laid
to the roote of the tree,</hi> what then? then every one commeth and ſaith <hi>what
ſhall we doe?</hi> you (ſaith he to ſome) <hi>that have two coates impart to him
that hath none:</hi> and to the <hi>ſouldiers</hi> when they ſay <hi>what ſhall we doe? doe
you no violence to any man, and be content with your wages.</hi> Mark, <hi>when
the Axe is laid to the roote of the tree,</hi> every one comes in then and ſaith
<hi>what ſhall we doe?</hi> You that are women and inferiour, doe you pray, and
cry, and further your husbands in all good, be not you backward, do not you
dravv them away when they would be liberall and forward, and adventure
themſelves, thorough your niceneſſe and daintineſs. And you that are men
of eſtates, if you aske what you ſhould doe? It is apparent, <hi>He that hath
two coates let him impart to him that hath none,</hi> bee willing to part with
much of your eſtates in ſuch a cauſe as this. And ſo ſouldiers, if you aske
vvhat you ſhould doe, behave your ſelves ſo as you may convince others, <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
no violence,</hi> but according to an orderly way, and <hi>be content with your
wages,</hi> perhaps it may not come in ſo fully afterwards, yet let it appear that
it is the cauſe that ſtrengtheneth you rather then your wages.</p>
               <p>Thus every one ſhould be of an inquiring ſpirit <hi>when the Axe is laid to
the roote of the tree.</hi> When we are in danger to be ſtripped of all, it is not
time then to ſtand about curioſities and niceties.</p>
               <p>Seventhly,<note place="margin">Obſ. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Leſt I ſtrip her naked, &amp;c.</hi> I have ſent my Prophets already
before, and they have offered mercie and denounced threatnings: Well, I
will now come another way, <hi>I will ſtrip her naked, &amp;c.</hi> The obſervation is,</p>
               <p>

That thoſe that will not be convinced by the word,<note place="margin">Lect. 2</note> God hath other means
to convince them, he hath other wayes then the word; if the word will not
convince them, pleading will not doe it it ſeems, and convincing argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
will not do it, well then, ſtripping naked ſhall doe it: As the expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                  <note place="margin">GODS works will convince when his word will not.</note> As you uſe to doe with thoſe that are of a ſleepy diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

and then falls down and ſleeps again, you call him again, and he anſwers &amp;
then ſleeps again, at length you come up and pull the cloaths of him &amp; leave

               <p>Thus the Scripture is cleare in it, and your experience is enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
it. For a man that hath beene a bondſlave in the Gallies, and after he
ſhould be ranſomed by the liberality of his friends here in England, if hee
ſhould be taken and brought back again to the gallies, oh how tedious and
grievous would it be! but if he had lived long here, and flouriſhed and got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
preferment and lived bravely, and had grown a great Merchant, &amp; then
after this to be brought againe to the gallies, how ſad a thing would this be!
it would be very terrible to him. If ſome of you that have beene beggars

venture the loſſe of your ſoules and God and all, then be brought into ſuch a
condition, and we ſee it that many men that have beene raiſed from a low e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
to an high, are ſo afraid of returning to a low eſtate again, that they will

venture ſoule, and conſcience, and God and all, rather then they will endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
themſelves in the leaſt degree in their eſtates.</p>
               <p>Hence it is very obſervable that the chiefe curſe that God threatneth the
people of Iſrael with, is that they ſhould returne to Egypt again, that the
Lord would bring them back to the condition wherein once they were.</p>
               <p>You ſhall finde that whole Chapter, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. is ſpent in denouncing
moſt dreadfull curſes upon the people; now for the concluſion of all, as the
chiefe curſe of all the reſt, ſaith the Text, there <hi>ver. 68. The Lord ſhal bring

               </p>
               <p>Were it not a ſad thing for us who have been acquainted with the glorious
light of the Goſpel, and with the bleſſed priviledges that come in thereby,
for us to be brought into Popiſh bondage and thraldome again? As <hi>Ezra.</hi>
9. 8. we may uſe his words, <hi>Now for a little ſpace grace hath been ſhewed
from the Lord our God, to leave us a remnant to eſcape, &amp; to give us a nayle
in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving

and joyne in affinity with thoſe abominations?</hi> As for our
ſelves who have had now of late a little taſt of the ſweetneſſe of our outward
priviledges and our liberties, for us to be brought into the bondage that wee
not long ſince were in, it would be a very ſad thing. Who could endure to
be under that bondage that he was in three or foure years agon, under every
Parator, Promoter, Purſevant, Commiſſary, Chancelour, and tyrannical
Prelate as formetly? we could not have met together and enjoyed the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty

to pray, but one or other would have been upon you and indangered your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates.
The bondage was intollerable, we may well complaine it was a yoke
that neither we nor our fathers could beare.</p>
               <p>The laſt Obſervation,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> and the way to prevent all is, When God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered

their duty often to thinke of the poor condition which once they were in, &amp;
to uſe all the means they can that they may not be brought thither again.</p>

conſider of our former low condition. It was a ſpeech Maſter <hi>Deering</hi> in
a Sermon that he preached before Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> hee hath this bold ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
to her, If there were a time that you thought your ſelf <hi>Tanquam o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis,</hi>
as a ſheepe ready to be ſlaine, take heed that the words of the Prophet
be not now true that you be not <hi>Tanquam indo mita Iuvencula,</hi> as an unta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
heifer. You may note the difference between the ſpirits of men in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
times in their plainneſs and boldneſs; and if there were an exceſſe that
way, how far the other way are our Court Sermons now? Qeen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
was once in a very low condition indeed, and ſhe thought her ſelfe to be as a
ſheepe appointed for the ſlaughter. It is uſuall for men raiſed up from a low
condition to forget God and themſelves,<note place="margin">Aſperius nihil eſt humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</note> and to grow proud &amp; ſcornfull.</p>
               <p>Nothing is more ſharpe then a low thing when it getteth up high; ſo there
is none that have more proud and ſcornfull ſpirits then thoſe that are raiſed
from the dunghil and gotten up high, they know not then where they are;
As the Proverb is, <hi>Set a beggar on horſe backe, and he knowes not how nor
whether to ride.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus it was with <hi>Saul,</hi> the vvay to humble <hi>Saul</hi> was for him to conſider
what he once was, and that is the way to humble us all who are ſubject to be
proud of our proſperity that God hath raiſed us unto. <hi>When thou waſt little
in thine own ſight,</hi> then thou wert made the head of the tribes of Iſrael. There
was a time that he was little in his own eyes, and I beſeech you obſerve the
difference between the ſpirit of <hi>Saul</hi> when he was in a low condition, and
his ſpirit vvhen he vvas raiſed. When <hi>Saul</hi> was in a low condition his ſpirit
vvas low, therefore 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 27. you ſhall finde that though there vvere

There ſhall not a man be put to death this day.</hi> O how meeke was <hi>Saul!</hi>
what a quiet ſpirit had he before he got up high! But afterward when he got
up and had many victories, then vvhat a furious and outragious ſpirit had
<hi>Saul!</hi> You know the ſtory of the four-ſcore and five Prieſts that muſt be

one of them did but give a little refreſhing unto <hi>David.</hi> What a ſtrange ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
is here in <hi>Saul,</hi> different to that he had when he was low.</p>
               <p>Is it not ſo with many of you? when God hath brought you low, you ſeeme
to be humble, and meek, and quiet then, and then you are content with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

kingdom, he vvould alwayes be ſerved at his table in earthen veſſels, to put
him in mind of that condition he was in before: certainly if in any place in
<hi>England</hi> it be ſeaſonable to ſpeake of this, it is here in London, where many
that have been Potters children, and in a low degree, have been raiſed up
high, and have gotten great eſtates. Let them remember in what condition
once they were, that they may be humbled, and ſo may prevent that danger
of being brought thither again. Many put others in mind of it in a taunting
vvay, I know vvhat you were not long agoe, I know vvhat your father vvas,
&amp;c. But doe you put your own ſoules in mind of this in an humbling way?
This is the vvay to continue mercies.</p>
               <p>But now apply vve it a little to our ſelves for the generall and then vve ſhal
conclude all. Let us vvork this upon our hearts. Look vve back to vvhat we
vvere lately, and let us check our hearts for any diſcontent in our preſent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate.
Not long ſince vvould not many of us have beene willing to have laid
dovvn our lives to have purchaſed that mercy we have had this yeer or two?
God hath granted to us our former mercies, &amp; raiſed us from our low con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of free coſt hitherto. God hath been afore. hand with us; and what if
thoſe mercies that are to come will be at ſome vvhat a dearer rate then thoſe
vvee have had already? Thoſe mercies vve have had already have been very
precious and ſweet; but ſurely they that are to come are more precious and
ſweet, and therefore vve may be content though they coſt us deare.</p>
               <p>Yet hovv vile are the ſpirits of men in forgetting the condition the ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
they lately were in, forgetting the Taxes and Monopolies, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty
of enjoying an thing that was your own; and now if there be but a
little charge comming, you preſently fall a murmuring and repining, Oh
theſe are heavy burthens, the Parliament burthens the kingdome and the
Couutrey, and as good have ſhip-money and other taxes as theſe burthens.
Oh unworthy, unworthy are you to live to ſee the goodneſſe of the Lord in
theſe dayes: unworthy to have thine eyes open to ſee what God hath done,
and thus to murmur. Thou ſhouldeſt magnifie Gods mercies, and not mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur

               <p>VVe have a notable parallel to this <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. in the ſtory of <hi>Corah, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi>

brought them up out of, that they ſaid flowed with milke and honey? It

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> indeed they were promiſed
a <hi>land of Canaan</hi> that ſhould <hi>flowe with milke and honey,</hi> and they put that
upon <hi>the land of Egypt;</hi> though they had been in bondage and ſlavery in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:42662:94"/>
and were now going to Canaan,<note place="margin">Lect. 1.</note> yet when they did but indure ſome
trouble in the vvay, and had but ſome oppoſition, and were put to ſome
ſtraits, then Egypt was the Land that flowed vvith milke and honey, and
who would come out of Egypt? So though God be bringing us to Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
to a bleſſed Land that floweth with milke and honey, yet becauſe there
are ſome ſtraits in the way, ſome difficulties, ſome oppoſitions, that may
coſt us ſomewhat; now how doe men cry out we vvere better before, you

will you bring us out of a Land that floweth with milke and honey? Oh
baſe murmuring and diſcontented ſpirits that forget what once they vvere,
and rather prize the bondage they were in before, then are thankfull for
Gods preſent mercies.</p>
               <p>For us not to look back to Gods former mercies, it goeth to the very heart
of God. God hath an expreſſion that it frets him to the very heart: You
have it in <hi>Ezek. 16. 43. Becauſe thou haſt not remembred the dayes of thy
youth, but haſt fret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed me in all theſe things.</hi> It is a thing that frets God
at his heart to ſee a people ſo unworthy of mercie, when God commeth in
ſuch wayes of mercie to them as he doth. My brethren, God hath done
great things for us whatſoever others ſay and thinke: Let them murmure,
and repine, and ſay what they will, let us ſay God hath done great things
for us: Let us lay to heart the condition we lately vvere in, that ſo we may
be ſtirred up now to ſeeke after God, that wee may never be brought into
that condition any more, if they would have it again, much good may it do
them, but for us let it be our care to ſeeke God, and to uſe all lawfull meanes
to prevent our bringing back to it again.</p>
               <p>For even the very ſtraits we now are in are an aggravation of our former
miſery and preſent mercie, it ſhould not therefore make our former miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
or preſent mercie ſeeme leſſe, but greater.</p>
               <p>How is that you will ſay?</p>
               <p>Thus, If now wee have ſo much helpe and power to hinder a malignant
party that ſeeke our ruine, yet they have ſo much ſtrength and reſolution,
what would have become of us if this had been before, when we had no
way nor no meanes to help us? If men complaine now, what vvould they
have done then? Therefore whereas we make uſe of our ſtraits, to make us
thinke that our former miſery was leſſe, and we are now in a ſadder condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
then before, rather let us make it an aggravation of Gods mercie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
us, and if wee be in ſuch ſtraits now when God hath raiſed up ſuch
meanes beyond all our thought to reſiſt the flowing in of miſery upon us,
Lord whether were wee a going? what would have become of us if the
ſtreame which hath been ſo long a ſwelling had broke in upon us when there
was no meanes to have reſiſted it? VVe may well ſee now that if their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
and reſolutions be ſo ſtrong for miſchiefe as will not be hindered,
notwithſtanding the preſent ſtrength God hath granted us to oppoſe them,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:42662:95"/>
ſurely they had moſt vile intentions,<note place="margin">Lect. 2.</note> and dreadfull things were determined a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
us, which would have brought us low indeed, and have made us the
moſt miſerable people upon the earth, if God had not come in ſo mira cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly
for our help as he hath done at this day.</p>
               <p>Therefore as we read of <hi>Jeremiah, Chap. 37. 18. Let my ſupplication,</hi>
ſaith he to the King, <hi>I pray thee be accept able before thee, that thou cauſe
me not to returne to the houſe of Jonathan the Scribe, leſt I dye there.</hi> So
let us preſent our ſupplications to the King of heaven, that wee may not be
ſent back to that condition we were once in, that God may not ſtrip us and
leave us naked. Wee have many bleſſings, Lord do not ſtrip us, doe not
ſtrip us of all the ornaments thou haſt put upon us.</p>
               <p>And would you not have God ſtrip you of your ornaments? be you wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to ſtrip your ſelves of your ornaments. <hi>Ezod.</hi> 33. 5. God calleth upon
the people there. <hi>Put off your Ornaments from you that I may know what
to doe unto you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is true and ſeaſonable at this time in the literall ſenſe, you are called
now to ſtrip you of your Ornaments. Strip from your fingers your gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
now when there is neede of them, perhaps one gold-ring that you have
upon your finger would ſerve to maintain a ſouldier a month or five weeks
or more, and yet you may have the benefit of it againe afterward. Strip
your Cup-boards from that pompous ſhew of plate that was wont to be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them. It is much if you ſhould not be willing to have your fingers ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
naked when we are in danger to have the State ſtript naked of all our
comforts and ornaments: Is it ſuch a great matter to have your cup-board
naked of plate now? what if a white cloath were upon it, and all that gliſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
ſhew taken away, were that ſuch a great matter now when God is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to ſtrip us naked, and ſet us as in the day wherein wee were borue?
certainly all of you that ſhall keep your plate now for the pompous decking
and adorning of your cup-boards you cannot but be aſhamed of it in theſe
times, ſurely you muſt rather keep it up in your trunkes and hutches, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but be both a ſin and a ſhame to ſee ſuch gliſtering pomp and glory in
ſuch times as theſe are.</p>
               <p>Strip your ſelves of your ornaments that God ſtrip you not; and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
outwardly, but ſtrip your ſelves of your ornaments by your humiliation,
for that is the meaning of that place in <hi>Exodus;</hi> Oh come and humble your
ſelves, and come now with naked hearts before the Lord, open your hearts
before God, bring them naked and ſincere before him, leſt he ſtrip you and
the Kingdom naked! Crie unto God for mercie, O Lord thou knoweſt
what a vile heart I have had, a baſe time-ſerving heart, yet Lord I deſire to
take away all thoſe clokes now, and to rend and bring this heart naked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thee, though it be a filthy heart, yet open it, Lord thou knoweſt thoſe
vile things, thoſe innovaſions, thoſe ſuperſtitions, thoſe horrible wickedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
that were in danger to be let into the Church and Comman-wealth, yet
they were things that could goe down very well with me, I could make ſhifts
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:42662:95"/>
to ſwallow them, and I had diſtinctions to colour them, but Lord it was
my baſe heart that I could not truſt thee, but now here I open it naked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thoe.</p>
               <p>O Lord for theſe Ordinances of thine in the purity and power of them
that others ſpake ſo much of, they have bin things unſavory to me, I had no
skill in ſuch things, Thou knoweſt I had a neutrelizing ſpirit, I looked
which way the wind blew; how juſt were it for thee to give me upto be of
a deſperate malignant ſpirit! Now Lord I come as a naked wretched crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
before thee, in the ſhame and guilt of my ſin, and here I acknowledge
thou maieſt juſtly ſtrip me naked of all the comforts of my eſtate, and leave
me in the moſt miſerable condition that ever poor creature was left in; And
now my heart is open before thee, doe but ſhew me what I ſhall doe, and
if thou doeſt reſerve any of my eſtate and comforts which I have forfeited,
in teſtimony of my humiliation for my former ſinnes I bring it before thee,
and am willing to give it up for the publique good, and to prevent that evill
and miſchiefe that I am ſure my ſinnes call for, for my ſins cry for wrath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Land, that thou ſhouldſt ſtrip it naked; and if all had beene ſuch
baſe ſpirits as I have beene, what would have become of the Land by this
time? In teſtimonie therefore of my humiliation for my ſins, here I bring
in this of my eſtate, though indeed if I had not been guilty of ſuch ſins, yet
out of common prudence, and reſpect to my own ſecurity, I might bring
ſome part in, but here is ſo much the more of my eſtate, becauſe my conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
tells me of my former guilt. And Lord for the time to come I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to doe the uttermoſt I can for Thee and thy Cauſe. And thoſe Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies
that carry their lives in their hands for me, God forbid that I ſhould
have the leaſt hand in betraying them, in withdrawing my hand and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
from them. Lord here I give up my ſelf to thee, and my eſtate, I ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
it to thee in an everlaſting Covenant.</p>
               <p>This is to come with a naked heart indeed before the Lord.</p>
               <p>Were it not better that we ſhould be willing to ſtrip our ſelves naked,
then that God ſhould doe it by violenee, that God ſhould ſend Souldiers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our houſes to ſtrip us naked, as they have dealt with our brethren in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?
they took not away their eſtates onely, but all their clothes, and ſent
them in droves as naked as ever they were borne. VVee know wee
have deſerved the like. If you will not ſtrip your ſelves of your ſuper <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>uities,
God may juſtly by them ſtrip you naked as ever you were born; and not
onely bring you into the ſame condition you were in, but into a far worſe, for
ſo he threatneth in that 28. <hi>Deut. You ſhall not onely be carryed backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine

buy you;</hi> they ſhould be in a worſe condition the when they were firſt in
Egypt. So if there be any of you that are willing to ſell your conſciences in
hope of preferment; Oh the other ſide may get power and prevaile, and ſo
out of hope to be, preferred, to ſell your conſciences, you may be diſappoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
not only be brought into as ill but into a far worſe condition; &amp; perhaps
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:42662:96"/>
though you would have ſold your ſelves, yet no bodie will buy you; if the
Papiſts corne to have the power of your bodies and eſtates, you may miſſe
of that preferment that you thinke of. So ſaith <hi>Ezra, Chap.</hi> 9. 14. after he
had ſpoken of Gods mercie in giving them liberty, and remitting their cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivitie,
<hi>Shall we</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>yet continue in ſin, &amp; break the commandements
of the Lord, would he not be angry with us till we were utterly deſtroyed?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And certainly if God do not awaken the hearts of people now, if God do
not give the people throughout the Kingdom a heart to ſtick to the Cauſe of
the Truth, and to thoſe whom they have intruſted with their eſtates, liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and lives in every good way, it were the heavieſt judgement of God
that ever was upon a Nation ſince the beginning of the earth, it would never
be paralleld, that ever a people ſhould have ſuch an opportunity put into
their hands to help themſelves, aud to vindica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

bondage, yet out of I know not what reſpects to betray all thoſe that have
ventured their lives for them, and to have their blood ſhed; I ſay it were ſuch
an example as were not to be paralleld ſince the beginning of the world.</p>
               <p>Therefore I beſeech you my brethren let us lay this to heart, and the Lord
make known to us all what is to be done in ſuch a time as this, that we may

               <p>There was a time wherein God had ſuch pittie upon his people, that hee

profeſt, that it was the ſweeteſt draught that ever he dranke in his life.</p>
               <p>This meditation may be very uſefull upon this evil of thirſt, that if a little
puddle water can afford ſo much comfort when the faculties are in ſuch a
diſpoſition as they are fit to draw out that comfort that is in this puddle wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
Oh then what comfort and goodneſſe is there in an infinite God when
he ſhall communicate to his creature all that good that is communicable,
and when all the faculties of ſoul and body ſhall be in a full diſpoſition, to
receive all the good that is communicated, and not put into a diſpoſion by
reaſon of want, but by reaſon of the excellency of the faculty raiſed to ſuch a
height, and inlarged to receive what good God himſelfe hath to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate

               <p>But further, it is obſervable. Though God did bring them into a wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and ſet them in a dry land, yet if they might have ſome drinke, though

and melt you, ſaith God.</hi> This may be a Comment upon this Text. <hi>I will
bring into the widerneſſe and ſet them in a dry land and ſlay them with
thirſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Saints may be brought into great extremity, but God leaveth them
not there. God makes their extremity his opportunity for mercy, he bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
refreſhing to them then, they never have more ſweet refreſhings from
God, then when they are in the greateſt extremities in regard of trouble and
affliction. God promiſeth, <hi>Eſay,</hi> 4. 6. that he will be <hi>a ſhadow for them in
the day time from the heat, and a covert from ſtorme and from raine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is Gods peculiar mercy to the Saints; perhaps they have no ſhelter
now, but when the ſtorme commeth they have a ſhelter then, and they have
a ſhadow when the heat commeth; in their extremity they have comfort.</p>
               <p>But it is otherwiſe with the wicked, the wicked perhaps may have many
ſhelters before the ſtorme commeth; but when the ſtorme commeth, then
they are deſtitute, they may have many ſhady places before the heat cometh,
but when the heat commeth, then they are left fuccourleſs, then they are ſlain
with thirſt. When wicked men are in proſperity, then there may come
one bleſſing after another (I meane that which is in it ſelf a bleſſing) heaped
upon them, but when they come into adverſity, when they have moſt need
of comfort, then they are left deſtitute.</p>
               <p>This <hi>ſlaying with thirſt</hi> is applyed by ſome ſpiritually; I will bring a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
famine upon them. When they ſhall be in a wilderneſſe, in a dry
land, when they ſhall have moſt need of comfort for their ſoules, they ſhall
be deprived of it. Many men in the time of their health and proſperity have
many ſweet promiſes of the Goſpel revealed unto them, many bleſſed mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations of Gods free grace and goodneſſe in his Chriſt made known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, but they ſlight and diſregard them: But when God ſhall bring
them into the wilderneſſe, when God ſhall cauſe them to be under the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a ſcorching conſcience, when conſcience ſhall be burning, and ſcal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
then perhaps they may long, Oh that I had one drop of water, one
promiſe out of the Word to comfort me! Oh that I might have but never
ſo little refreſhing! Oh that I might heare againe thoſe things I have here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
heard and neglected! But then God may deny one drop of water to
coole their ſcorching conſciences and ſtay them with thirſt, ſlay their ſoules
with thirſt at that time: And thus many poore creatures are ſlain with
thirſt, that did ſo little regard thoſe rivers of conſolation, that in the time of
their proſperity they might have had.</p>

               <p>I confeſſe at the firſt view, looking upon this verſe I thought I might

               <p>
                  <hi>And I will not have mercy</hi>] This Particle [<hi>And</hi>] hath much in it, it is
a moſt terrible <hi>And.</hi> This conjunction many times in Scripture is as a ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onaſme,
and doth not ſerve for much uſe, but here in this place it is of great
uſe, and it is filled with terrour as full as it is poſſible for ſuch a little particle
to hold.</p>
               <p>I know there may be many curioſities ſometimes in obſervatious of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
of conjunctions: but we ſhall not meddle with any curioſity, but
ſpeake of that which is plain, and the intention of the Holy Ghoſt here. I ſay
this <hi>And</hi> is a moſt dreadfull <hi>And;</hi> marke the conjunction, you had foure
<hi>Ands</hi> before, ſaith God, <hi>I will ſtrip her naked, [And] ſet her as in the day
wherein ſhe was borne, And] make her as a wilderneſſe, [And] ſet her
as a dry Land, [And] ſlay her with thirſt.</hi> Is not here enough? Oh no,
there cometh a fifth <hi>And,</hi> and that is more terrible then all the former foure
<hi>[And] I will have uo more mercy upon her children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This addeth terrour to all the reſt. Suppoſe that all the other foure had
beene, and if this had not come, there had not beene ſuch a grievous threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
If God had ſaid, <hi>I will ſtrip her naked &amp; ſet her as in the day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
ſhe was borne, and I will make her as a wilderneſſe, and ſet her as a dry
land, and ſlay her with thirſt,</hi> yet if there might be mercy in all this, their
condition had not beene ſo miſerable, but (ſaith God) I will doe all theſe,
<hi>And I will have no more mercy upon them.</hi> Oh this hath that terrour in it,
that it is impoſſible for the heart of a man that apprehends it to ſtand under
it.</p>
               <p>And for the opening of this I ſhall ſhew you how that all the former foure
not only may ſtand with Gods mercy, but they have ſtood with Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
that God had heretofore ſhewed mercy to them when they were in ſuch
<hi>a low condition in which they were borne,</hi> when they were in the <hi>wilderneſſe,</hi>
when they were in <hi>a dry Land,</hi> yea when he did <hi>ſlay them,</hi> he ſhewed mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
unto them. But now he ſaith, he will do thus and thus, and ſhew <hi>no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>
unto them. So that then though this <hi>And</hi> be conjunctive in Grammar,
yet here in Divnity it is a disjunctive, and a moſt dreadfull disjunctive to
part them and mercy a ſunder, yea and to part many of them and mercie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally
aſunder.</p>
               <p>To ſhew you therefore the ſoure former, that though they were in ſuch a
condition heretofore, yet God did ſhew them mercie; now what a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is that God will ſhew them no mercie. As</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>In the day wherein they were borne,</hi> that (as you may remember)
I ſhewed you out of the 16. <hi>Ezek.</hi> what a low and pittifull condition the
people of Iſrael were in, they were <hi>caſt out in the field,</hi> &amp; they were <hi>in their<pb n="194" facs="tcp:42662:99"/>

threatneth to caſt them off for ever, ſo as he will ſee them in their blood, but
it ſhall be no more a time of love, but a time of wrath, and he will no more
enter into covenant with them, neither ſhall they be his.</p>
               <p>2. When God brought them into the wilderneſſe, God there ſhewed
them mercy, for that you have a marvellousfull Text, <hi>Deut. 32. 10. Hee
found them in a deſart land, and in the waſt howling wilderneſſe;</hi> but
mark, <hi>he led them about, he inſtructed them, he kept them as the apple of
his eye.</hi> Though they were in a waſt howling wilderneſſe, yet they were
as deare to God <hi>as the apple of his eye.</hi> Yea further, <hi>ver. 11. As an eagie
ſtirreeth up her noſt, fluttereth over her young, ſpreadeth abroad her
wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings, ſo the Lord alone did lead
them.</hi> It is the note of <hi>Paulus Fagius,</hi> citing for it <hi>Rabbi Solomon</hi> upon
this, as the Eagle carries her young ones, not as other birds, for other birds
it is obſerved carry their young ones in their claws, the Eagle bears hers up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her wings, and this is the reaſon that is obſerved, becauſe the Eagle is
more tender of her young ones then other birds are, why? for other birds
carrying their young ones in their claws, if any ſhoot at them, they hit the
young ones, and kill them firſt, but may miſſe the old one; but the Eagle
carries hers upon her back, upon her wings, that whoſoever ſhoots at her
young ones, they muſt ſhoot through her firſt: So ſaith God, I carried
you in the wilderneſſe as the Eagle carries her young ones upon her wings,
that if any ſhoot at you to hurt you, they muſt ſhoote through me firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they can come at you. This was Gods mercy to them when they were
in the waſt howling wilderneſſe, here is not ſuch an <hi>And,</hi> they were in a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe,
yet God had much mercy upon them.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, milestone God brought them into <hi>a dry Land,</hi> in this wilderneſſe they
wanted water, yet (though they were ready to murmure) <hi>he made them
ſucke honey out of the rocke, and oile out of the flinty rocke,</hi> Deut. 32. 13.
You will ſay, when did God make them ſuck honey out of the rock? wee
read indeed that water guſhed out of the rocke in a dry land, but here the
Scripture ſpeaks, that <hi>he made them ſuck honey &amp; oile out of the flinty rock.</hi>
It is a note of <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſpeaking upon this very thing, of Gods making
them <hi>ſucke honey and oile out of the rocke:</hi> Not, ſaith he, that there was
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:42662:99"/>
indeed honey or oyle came out of the rock, but becauſe they being in the

               <p>Thence he gathered that note, that want and neceſſity will make every

that want. When you are at your full tables, This wine pleaſeth you not,

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
Can you ſhew us any place wherein God did ſlay his people, yet ſhew mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
to them? Yes, I can. There is a place where it is ſaid, <hi>God ſlew his people,</hi>
yet for all that at that very time he ſhewed abundance of mercie to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
when God did come with his ſword in his hand, yet with abundance of
compaſſion in his heart. The Scripture is in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 34. Marke what the
Text ſaith there, <hi>When he ſlew them, then they ſought him, and they return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and enquired early after God, and they remembred that God was their
Rocke.</hi> Well, <hi>they ſought him,</hi> and <hi>they remembred</hi> this, <hi>that God was
their Redeemer,</hi> but did God redeeme them at that time? Yes, verſe 38.
<hi>He being full of compaſſion for gave their iniquity, and deſtroyed them not,
yea many a time he turned his anger away, and did not ſtir up all his wrath,</hi>
Or as the old Tranſlation hath it, <hi>He called backe his anger,</hi> which here he
will not doe: He <hi>was full of compaſſion, and forgave their iniquity, and
called back his anger,</hi> though he did <hi>ſlay them</hi> at that time.</p>
               <p>He denieth to doe it here, he letteth out his anger here to the full, and will
not call it back, <hi>I will have no mercy upon them:</hi> And it is obſervable in this
Scripture that yet the Text ſaith before that, <hi>they did but flatter God with
their mouth:</hi> though they <hi>did but flatter God with their mouth,</hi> yet ſuch was
Gods mercie toward them, that he <hi>calleth back his anger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My brethren, God hath a high eſteeme of his worſhip in a Nation; though
it ſhould be but externall (but we muſt not reſt in that) yet many times ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
humilliation and worſhipping of God in a Nation hath beene ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall
to deliver them from externall judgements.</p>
               <p>Therefore we have much cauſe to be incouraged, in that God doth ſtirre
up our Nation at this day, yea and thoſe particularly that are going in that
expedition and ſervice for the Kingdome, that God doth ſtirre them up to
goe forth worſhipping of him.</p>
               <p>Our adverſaries come againſt them with Oathes and curſes, and they
goe againſt them with faſting and prayer, not externally onely, but we hope
internally many of them, and thouſands that joine with them in our Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And if God will ſhew ſo much mercy to them when they did but flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him with their mouth, ſurely then when as there are ſo many true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers
of him, yea thoſe that are the inſtruments of the work; we have
much cauſe to think that God will ſhew mercy to us, and that if anger were
come out againſt us, yet God will call it backe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:42662:100"/>
Thus then we ſee that ſo long as Gods people be Gods people, though they
may be brought to great troubles (we cannot be ſecured from troubles) yet
ſtill there is mercie for them; ſo long as they are his people, ſo long as the
knot is between God and them, and they are in Covenant, there is mercie
for them. But now when they are caſt off, now there commeth an <hi>and,</hi> I
will doe thus and thus, bring them into theſe extremities, and I will ſhew no
mercy to them, there ſhall be judgement without mercie. The obſervation
then from hence is,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> when God commeth upon the wicked with wrath, hee
cometh with pure wrath. Wrath without mixture of mercie, and this is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable.
We have a remarkable place for this <hi>Iſa. 7. 5. An evil</hi> (ſaith the

                  <hi>behold it is comming.</hi> Marke, there may come an evil
to the people of God, that which materially is evill, but it can never be ſaid
of Gods people that an evill, an only evill is comming: If an evil come,
there cometh a great good together with that evil: but now it is upon the
wicked, an evil, &amp; an onely evil is coming. God threatneth <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75. 8. that
he hath <hi>a cup in his hand, full of mixture,</hi> the mixture of that is an aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the wrath that is in it: but here there is a cup in Gods hand without
mixture, and the want of mixture is the aggravation of the evil of this cup.</p>
               <p>VVhen wrath is pure, then it is grown beyond anger, and grown to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ſo long as it is but meere anger, it admitteth of mixture of love, but
when once it is (as we may ſpeak) grown to that height of ſowerneſs that all
the mixture of love is gone, then it is turned to hatred. There was a time
when Iſrael ſpake in a <hi>murmuring</hi> way that <hi>God brought them into the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe
becauſe he hated them. Deut.</hi> 1. 27. But now God threatneth to
bring them into the wilderneſſe and to hate them indeed, according to that
<hi>Hoſea 9. 15. All their wickedneſſe is in Gilgal, for there I hated them.
David</hi> prayeth <hi>Pſal.</hi> 6. 1. that God would not <hi>rebuke him in his wrath,
neither chaſten him in his hot diſpleaſure;</hi> but what then? <hi>Have mercy u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
me O Lord:</hi> So long as God ſheweth mercie he doth not chaſten in his
ſore diſpleaſure: but when God commeth with afflictions &amp; denyeth mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
then he commeth in ſore diſpleaſure indeed, it is hatred.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, When God commeth without mercie he commeth upon the
wicked in the moſt unſeaſonable time for them that can be. That is the
difference betwixt the evills that come upon the godly and the wicked.</p>
               <p>There may be evills (that materially are ſo) upon the godly, but yet they
ſhall come upon them when it ſhall be ſeaſonable for them: but when they
come upon the wicked it ſhal be when they are moſt unſeaſonable for them:
As a husband-man if he would cut his Tree ſo as onely to lop it that it may
grow and flouriſh again, he will be ſure to do it in due time, as in <hi>January</hi> or
<hi>February,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iudgments upon the wicked at times moſt unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for them.</note> but if he would cut it that ſo it may dye, hee will lop it when it
flouriſheth moſt, at Midſummer. God indeed letteth wicked men grow
up and flouriſh to the height of their proſperity, and then he commeth and
loppeth them becauſe then hee knowes they muſt die and periſh. It were
better to be lopped in <hi>January,</hi> in winter time before you flouriſh, then you
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:42662:100"/>
may live for your good; but if you ſtay till the ſummer, you die for it. You
have an excellent Scripture, <hi>Zeph. 2. 4. They ſhall drive out Aſhdod at noon
day.</hi> In thoſe Countries that were exceeding hot and ſcorching, ſhe pheards
and others that had their buſineſſe abroad, uſed to keep their houſes at noon
day, or get into ſome ſhady places and ſleepe. Now when God threatneth
a judgement in wrath, and denyeth mercie, ſaith hee, <hi>they ſhall drive out
Aſhdod at noone day,</hi> in the worſt time that poſſibly <hi>Aſhdod</hi> can be driven
out, in the middeſt of ſcorching. Becauſe God intended to deſtroy them,
he drives them out at noone day.</p>
               <p>Again thirdly, When God commeth upon the wicked and denyeth mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
he regardeth not the proportion of any affliction or any evill, whether it
be enough or not enough for them, what is that to him? When hee cometh
upon his own people he weigheth out his wrath. Never did any skilfull Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian
or Apothecary more carefully weigh out to every dram what the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſhould be that is to be given to a child,<note place="margin">God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions afflictions to his child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, but not to the wicked.</note> then God doth weigh out every
affliction that he ſendeth upon his children. The difference is juſt as if you
ſhould goe to the Apothecaries to take ratsbane to poyſon or kill vermine,
you doe not weigh out how much you ſhould take, but give them it at ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture,
and let them take as much as they will, and let them burſt: but if
you take any thing for your child, if it have any ſtrong vertue in i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
compoſition, it may be poiſon, you will take heed, you will not take a
dram, a graine too much, but will be ſure to weigh it out exactly.</p>
               <p>Thus though when God commeth to his children hee weigheth out their
afflictions, yet when he cometh with judgements upon the wicked, he cares
not how much, how many or great they be, whether ſutable to their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
or no, whether they can beare them or no, whether their backes breake
or no, he cometh with judgements upon them to deſtroy them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Hoſ. 7. 14. Ezek. 8. 18</note> When afflictions commeth without mercie upon the wicked,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
God ſtoppeth his ears at all their cryes. If they cry when God cometh with
judgements againſt them, he calleth their cryings <hi>howling.</hi> Hee tells them
<hi>though they cry aloud, yea cry with teares he will not heare them,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, God commandeth all creatures that they ſhould deny help to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
them. They may ſtand and be amazed, but help them they cannot. They
all ſay how can we help, ſeeing God helpes not.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, There is the curſe of God mixed with every judgement to drive <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
them further from God, and to harden them more in their ſinnes.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, One judgement is but the making way for another, yea all judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
in this world are but the fore-runners, and makers-way for eternall
judgements. This is the portion of the cup of the wicked when God ſaith
he will ſhew them no mercie. The afflictions of the Saints may ſeeme to
be more grievous outwardly, but thus God never afflicteth them, there is
mercie alwayes for them.</p>
               <p>VVherefore all yee Saints of God who are under any affliction at any
time, be patient and quiet, be contented under it, for though your afflictions
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:42662:101"/>
before and grievous,<note place="margin">Lect. 3.</note> yet God delivereth you from ſuch afflictions as theſe
wherein he ſaith he will ſhew no mercie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But further.</hi> I will not have mercy upon her children.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Her children.</hi>] The judgement of God in puniſhing the ſin of the fathers
upon the children we ſpake ſomewhat of in the Chapter before, wee will
wholly let that paſſe now: and onely conſider <hi>children</hi> in another way then
we did before, in a politicall conſideration, for certainly that is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Text, <hi>I will not have mercy upon her children;</hi> that is, I will not
have mercie upon the particular people that belong to <hi>Iezreel.</hi> Private and
particular people are called <hi>the daughters of Jeruſalem,</hi> the daughters of
ſuch a Country. So that the whole community together with the officers &amp;
Governours they are as the <hi>Mother,</hi> and the private and particular people
they are as the <hi>children.</hi> So that when God ſaith he will have no mercy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>her children,</hi> hee doth not onely threaten the State and the Church, the
Governours and the whole Community thus, but he threatneth every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
perſon of them, though you that are in the multitude perhaps thinke
you may eſcape in the crowde; No ſaith God, I will looke to every one of
you of the multitude of the private and particular perſons of Iſrael, and my

               <p>It is true indeed, the heads and governours of places are uſually moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velved
in the guilt of the ſins of nations, and their judgements are uſually
moſt dreadfull when God commeth with nationall judgements. As <hi>Num.</hi>
35. 3. 4. The Text ſaith there that <hi>Iſrael joyned themſelves to Baal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Peor,
and the anger of the Lord was kindled againſt Iſrael, and the Lord ſaid
unto Moſes, take all the heads of the people, and hang them up before the

Lord, that the fierce anger of the Lord might be turned away from Iſrael.</p>
               <p>Certainly execution of wrath upon great ones, upon ſuch as have beene
heads in evill, is a Sacrifice exceeding well pleaſing to God. But though
God ay<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>e at them eſpecially in nationall judgements, yet the multitude
and private people muſt not thinke to eſcape, and that upon theſe grounds.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe many times it is for their ſins that God ſuffereth their
Governours to doe ſo much evill as they doe,<note place="margin">Gods judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as well as againſt Governors, and why.</note> As, Iſrael had ſinned, and
God was wrath with Iſrael, therefore <hi>David</hi> did what he did <hi>in numbring
the people.</hi> When you ſee your Governours doe that which is naught, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for your own ſins; doe not ſpend your time onely in crying out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them, but look to yourſelves, it is for your ſinnes that God hath left
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> them to do as they have done.<note place="margin">2 Sam. 24. 1.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, It may be the reaſon why Governours do not reforme, is, in
the perverſeneſſe of people, that they are not in a preparation to receive that
good which otherwiſe our Governours had in their hands &amp; hearts to bring
to paſſe. As 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. 33. it is cleere there, <hi>Howbeit the high places
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:42662:101"/>
were not taken away,</hi> why? <hi>For as yet the people had not prepared their
hearts to ſeeke the God of their Fathers.</hi> Why? ſhould they have pulled
down the high places? no, but they ſhould have beene in a preparation for
the pulling of them downe. Certainly this is the great cauſe why our high
places are not pulled downe, why Reformation hath gone on no better then
it hath, and why we have ſo much evil remaining amongſt us, becauſe the
people have not prepared their hearts, they are not in a diſpoſition to receive
the mercie that our governours have hearts to bring unto us.</p>
               <p>They have hearts to work for us, but when we ſpeake to them of what is
fit to be done, their anſwer is, but is England in a fit diſpoſition to receive
ſuch a thing as that is? ſo that the truth is, although you are ready to cry out
of your Governours, you ſay, they have power in their hands, why doe they
not reforme things? yet the guilt in great part devolves upon the people, they
are not in a fit d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>le here.</p>
               <p>Again further, It may be it is from you that the Governours that are evil
are ſo much incouraged and abetted in that which is evill: though you doe
it not, yet you ſo much incourage them as the guilt redounds upon you.</p>
               <p>Yea laſtly, If you do but obey them in any thing that is evill, in doing of
that, the guilt devolveth upon you, for you ſhould not do it, but rather obey
God then man.</p>
               <p>Many thinke to make this their plea, they are commanded to doe thus and
thus, and Governours would have them doe it, and it is Law and the like,
and they thinke upon this plea they may do any thing in the world. This will
not ſecure you, God may come with judgement without mercie upon the
children as well as upon the Mother. And if Gods wrath ſhould come in
nationall judgements againſt England, let the people know that they are
like to ſmart moſt dreadfully, for never was their a time in our dayes, nor in
our fore-fathers dayes, that ſo much depended upon the people as at this day;
never were they called to that help as now they are called to at this day.</p>
               <p>So that the people now may have reformation,<note place="margin">Much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends now upon the people.</note> they may have bleſſings,
if it be not through their own default. As <hi>Cant.</hi> 7. 1. The Church is there
deſcribed in her beauty, and it beginneth at her feete, <hi>How beautifull are
thy feete?</hi> And <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. There Chriſt is deſcribed in his beauty, and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth
at the head, <hi>His head is as the moſt faire gold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God ſometimes makes uſe of the people to be great meanes, and perhaps
the beginning of means to bring beauty to the Church, though they cannot
perfect it. Heretofore private perſons could doe little: Alas though they
were under grievous oppreſſions, they knew not now to help themſelves.</p>
               <p>Many men that had purſes, and ſtrength, and heads, and hearts and all,
yet they knew not what to doe, but to make their moane one to another, and
to heaven; but now it is otherwiſe, now you may do ſomewhat elſe beſides

for the publique good, for Religion, for liberty, you that have ſtrength of
body may know what to doe, you that have head-pieces, I mean parts, you
are called to help, you may joyne together for God and the good of your
Country, you may do much more then heretofore could be done.</p>
               <p>Wherefore now if you ſhould deſert the Cauſe of God, and deſert thoſe
that you have truſted, you muſt expect the moſt dreadfull wrath of God,
and that without mercie, even upon the people that ever was upon any nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſince the beginning of the world, for never any nation that we know of,
had more depending upon the people then there is at this day upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

men, upon the children, even every one of them: And why?</p>
               <p>For they are the children of whoredomes.</p>
               <p>That is either paſſively or actively, paſſively, becauſe they were begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

they have had it from their parents, Or elſe <hi>they are the children of

               <p>From hence,</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> There is little hope of children brought up in wicked education,
who have wicked parents alſo. If the dye have beene in the wooll it is hard

               <p>Yet Secondly,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> This ſhall not excuſe children, though they be the children

according as they brought them up. No it excuſeth not at all, for the wrath of

Therefore it is like our condition would have been the ſame if God had not

doe you look to your children, and bring them up in the truth. Children

Here is a dreadfull threat againſt the children of whoredomes, againſt
ſuch as follow the wayes of the great whore of Babylon. Bleſſed are they
that in theſe times have teſtimony in their own conſciences, that it hath been
their care above all things to draw themſelves out from the guilt of all ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious
and Idolatrous vanities, and to keep themſelves (according to
that light that God hath diſcovered to them) pure from the pollutions of
that man of ſin. Bleſſed I ſay are theſe, they need not feare this day; but for
thoſe that have involved themſelves in the guilt of thoſe pollutions, they
have need to humble their ſouls before God, and to cry mightily, for wrath
is going out againſt the children of whoredomes. This Text here ſpoken of,
is not meant only of hell hereafter, but it is meant of judgement even in this
world: And above all times that ever yet have been ſince Antichriſt began,
it is a moſt deſperate thing to be a Papiſt in theſe dayes, becauſe now is the
time for God to make theſe children of whoredomes the very Butt of his
wrath and indignation.</p>
               <p>We heare of wars, and rumors of wars, and a great deale of ſtir there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad:
My brethren, keep your hearts chaſt to God, and fear not, for God
hath another manner of people to deal withall then you; you ſhall be ſealed
firſt, before the wrath come out. Though I cannot excuſe you altogether
from ſuffering ſome afflictions, theſe children of whoredomes may bring
ſome trouble upon the Saints for the preſent; yea perhaps ſome of you may
have your blood ſpilt, but God hath mercy to beſtow upon you, but for
them there is wrath, and wrath without mixture, God ſaith he will have no
mercy upon the children of whoredoms.</p>
               <p>Let ſuch as are going forth then in this Service, for Religion and Liberty,
go forth with courage and undauntedneſſe of ſpirit, why? for they fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
none but thoſe that God fighteth againſt. Who are they but the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of whoredomes that they go to fight againſt, thoſe who have ſhewed
themſelves to be open fighters againſt God and his truth, ſuch as are moſt
abominable ſwearers, curſers, and blaſphemers, ſuch as make no other
uſe of the light of the Goſpel that they have, but only to ſcorn and contemn
it, ſuch as are open deſpiſers of God and his truth, and of his people? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
if there be a curſed generation upon the face of the earth, theſe are the
people, whoſe mouths are full of curſes, and certainely Gods curſe is upon
them who are ſo full of curſings themſelves. If there be any of you here that
are now, or hereafter may go forth in this ſervice, your ſpirits ſhould even
riſe with indignation againſt ſuch monſters upon earth, and goe againſt
them as <hi>David</hi> againſt <hi>Goliah, What ſhall this uncircumciſed Philiſtine
defie the hoaſt of the living God?</hi> Thus your hearts ſhould riſe if you have
any love to God and his truth; Shall a company of curſed monſters that do
nothing but blaſpheme, and curſe, and ſweare, and defie God and his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
and his Tabernacle, and worſhip; ſhall theſe uncircumciſed Philiſtins
go on thus defying God and his truth? If you have the hearts of men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
you, eſpecially of Chriſtians, me thinks you ſhould not be able to beare it,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:42662:103"/>
but goe forth againſt them with fulneſſe of ſpirit and reſolution, certainely
God will make them a prey to you, they are not only ſuch as not only have
put off Chriſtianity, and are become Atheiſts, but they have put off all kind
of humanity, and are rather turned monſtrous beaſts, or devils. Fear them
not, though their hearts be full of pride and rage, and though they beaſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo much what they are, or what they have done, or what they will doe;
I ſay feare them not, for this is part of the curſe of God that is upon them
that though God fighteth againſt them, they will not ſee it, they ſhall not
ſee it, becauſe God intendeth to deſtroy them; though judgments are out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them,<note place="margin">Revel. 9. 21. Chap. 16, 9. 11.</note> yet they will not repent. You ſhall finde it divers times in the
book of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> that thoſe that followed Antichriſt, though they
were tormented, all the judgments of God were againſt them, yet they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
not. This I ſay is the curſe of God upon ſuch, God will not give
them repentance unto life, for they are the children of whoredoms, whom
God intendeth to have no mercy upon: therefore the higher their rage ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,
the higher your hearts ſhould riſe againſt them.</p>
               <p>But we muſt go on to the 5. verſe.</p>
               <p>For their mother hath played the harlot.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Their mother,</hi> that is, the State and the Church, for they were both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved
in one, <hi>hath played the harlot.</hi> This [<hi>For</hi>] hath reference two ways;
either it may have reference to thoſe words, <hi>I will not have mercy upon
them, for</hi> not only they are, but their mother is defiled with whoredomes,
ſhe hath played the harlot: or ſecondly, it hath reference onely to the latter
part, they are the children of whoredomes, <hi>for their mother hath played the
harlot:</hi> either it referreth to the reaſon why God will not have mercy upon
them, becauſe <hi>their mother hath played the harlot:</hi> or ſecondly to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
why they are the children of whoredomes, <hi>for their mother hath play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the harlot.</hi> And from both theſe references we have very uſefull obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
for us.</p>
               <p>The firſt,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> God cannot endure a ſucceſſion in wickedneſſe, I will not
have mercy upon them, <hi>their mother hath played the harlot,</hi> they are
children of whoredoms themſelves, and their mother hath plaid the harlot,
there is a ſuccesſion of wickedneſſe among them, and that I cannot beare.
The ground is, becauſe thoſe that keep up a ſuccesſion of wickedneſſe from
the mother to the children, and ſo goe on downeward, they are guilty of all
the wickedneſſes that went before them in that line; Elſe how can that be
underſtood where Chriſt ſaith he will <hi>require all the blood from Abel
to Zacharias upon that generation;</hi>

                     </gap> dreadfull.</note> but becauſe they continuing in
that way of ſin, kept up the ſuccesſion of that ſin, and ſo that generation
was guilty of all the ſins of that kind that went before even unto <hi>Abel.</hi> So
the father is a whore-maſter, and the child he proveth to be one too, and ſo
goeth on, the child is not only guilty of that ſinne of his owne, but of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and of his grandfathers, and hee is guilty of all that kind of ſinne that
is gone before, even up to the beginning of the world; why? becauſe hee
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:42662:104"/>
keepeth up the ſucceſſion of that ſinne in the world. This is a moſt terrible
thing to conſider of, enough to wound the ſtrongeſt heart in the world, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
of thoſe that know they have had wicked Parents.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>For their mother hath plaid the harlot,</hi> conſider this word <hi>For,</hi>
as having reference to the reaſon why they are children of whoredomes, <hi>for
their mother hath plaid the harlot.</hi> The obſervation is,</p>
               <p>Children uſually goe according to their parents, which way their parents
goe, commonly the children goe. It is a uſuall thing where there are
prophane parents to have prophane children, if the parents ſweare to have
ſwearing children, if the parents be ſuperſtitious to have ſuperſtitious chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
if parents be ſcorners of Religion, to have children ſcorners too: we
find it true in experience, in that new nick-name that is brought up on the
godly in roome of the former, it is as frequent in the mouths of children as
in others, becauſe children go according to what their fathers formerly did:
I will give you one notable Text of Scripture for this, it is 2 <hi>King.</hi> 2. 23.
When <hi>Eliſha</hi> the Prophet was going up to <hi>Bethel,</hi> there came forth little
children out of the City and ſaid unto him, <hi>Goe up thou bald-head,
goe up thou bald-head.</hi> The thing that I note it for is this, that not
only the children did it, and ſo were deſtroyed, (for two ſhe-beares
came out of the wilderneſſe and tare 42. of them) but what children
were they that did this? If you obſerve the Text, you ſhall finde that they
were <hi>the children of Bethel;</hi> and what place was that? That was one of
the places where the calves were ſet up, and it was a place of much ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition,
and the children were as ſuperſtitious as their parents: A place that
had the name, the houſe of God, but a place exceedingly abuſed, and no
place did more degenerate from the name then it, it was a Bethaven, a houſe
of vanity and wickedneſſe. It was the place that was moſt ſuperſtitious,
and thoſe were the children that ſcorned at the Prophet: But we need no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
proof but only experience, yet there is one notable Scripture further
for it, <hi>Jer. 7. 18. The children</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>gather wood, their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
kindle the fire, and their mothers kneaded the dough:</hi> the children
joyned you ſee: <hi>Pelagius</hi> thought that there was no ſinne came into the
world but only by imitation, children imitating their parents. Certainly
imitation is of great power and force to prevaile with the hearts of children.
You that are wicked parents, had need to looke to it what you doe before
your children. He that ſinneth before a child, ſpecially a parent, ſinneth
doubly,<note place="margin">Qui pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ero his peccat.</note> for a child will be ready to imitate it. What, will you not only ſin
againſt God, and be enemies unto him, but will you leave a ſucceſſion,
that when you are dead and gone, ſome muſt out of your loynes, and from
your bowels, blaſpheme God after you are rotten in your graves? Suppoſe
you that are parents had a plague ſore upon you, would you goe among
your children, and breath upon them? this cruelty is much worſe, will you
goe into your families, and breath infection into your children, and ſo make
them like you, and guilty of your ſins, and of the plagues of God together
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:42662:104"/>
with you? oh cruell parents!</p>
               <p>On the otherſide, as therefore <hi>children of whoredomes,</hi> becauſe <hi>their
mother hath plaid the harlot,</hi> why then ſhould not children be gracious
and godly, who have gracious and godly parents? Why ſhould it not be
ſaid, This childe is a godly childe, for his mother was a gracious woman,
and his father a godly man? You that have godly parents, let this be your
<hi>Encomium,</hi> You are godly and gracious children, and you had godly and
gracious parents, this will be your honour before the Saints. But how vile
is it, when it may be ſaid, Here is a wicked wretch, yet he had a godly
father, and a godly mother; here is an uncleane and filthy liver, yet hee had
gracious parents? It is no wonder to ſay thus, This man is filthy, for his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was filthy, and his mother was a harlot; but to look upon one, and ſay,
Here is a whoremaſter, yet his father was a godly gracious man; Here is a
harlot, yet her mother was a holy woman; O how vile is that! I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
a ſpeech of that reverend Maſter <hi>Bolton,</hi> who died not long ſince; It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that upon his death-bed he had his children come to him, &amp; he ſpeaks
thus unto them, I doe believe, ſaith he, there is never a one of you will dare
to meet me at the tribunall of Chriſt in an unregenerate condition. So let
me ſay to you that are evill children of Godly parents, let me in their names
ſpeak to you, How dare you, with what face doe you think you ſhall dare
to meet with your godly father and gracious mother before the judgement
ſeat of Jeſus Chriſt? at that day if your godly father ſtand at the right hand
of Chriſt, how dare you appeare before that face in the guilt of thoſe horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
wickedneſſes that you now live in? Certainly the thought of this hath
power to daunt your hearts.</p>
               <q>She hath done ſhamefully.</q>
               <p>The word in the Hebrew (it is in <hi>Hyphil,</hi> and ſo it may be tranſlated
tranſitively) ſignifieth,<note place="margin">pudef a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciens.</note> 
                  <hi>She hath made aſhamed,</hi> as well as <hi>done ſhamefully;</hi>
and ſo I find it according to ſome thus rendered, Shee hath made aſhamed
her husband, ſhe hath made aſhamed her children, ſhee hath made aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
her ſelf, and all theſe three may be meant. Yea I conceive the intent
of the holy Ghoſt is to expreſſe them all.</p>
               <p>Her husband firſt, the Church is the Spouſe of Jeſus Chriſt, Chriſt is
the husband of the Church, and you know the Scripture ſaith that <hi>the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
is the glory of the man.</hi> I remember I gave the meaning of that
heretofore; So the Church being the Spouſe of Chriſt, ſhould be the glory
of Chriſt: the woman ſhould be the glory of the man, but yet being wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and filthy, ſhe makes her husband many times aſhamed. The evil of the
wife is a ſhame to the husband, ſo the evill of the Church is a ſhame to
Ieſus Chriſt. The Church in Scripture is called the glory of Chriſt, 2
<hi>Cor. 8. 23. If our brethren be enquired after, they are the meſſengers of
the Churches, and the glory of Chriſt.</hi> Iſa. 4. 5. <hi>Vpon all the glory ſhall
be a defence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:42662:105"/>
It ſhould be ſo, but when it commeth to be defiled, it ſhameth Chriſt,
their wickedneſſe reflects upon Chriſt. Chriſt is ſaid to <hi>walke in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
of the golden Candleſticks, Rev.</hi> 2. 1. Every Church is a Candle-ſtick,
and it ſhould be a golden Candle-ſticke, but if it come to be a filthy ruſtie
Candle-ſtick,<note place="margin">The Saints muſt take heed they be not a ſhame to Chriſt.</note> it is a diſhonour unto Chriſt who walketh amongſt them.</p>
               <p>Wicked men doe not ſhame Chriſt, but godly doe. My brethren let us
take heed of that, It is an evill thing to bring ſhame to our ſelves, and one to
another, but to bring ſhame upon JESUS CHRIST is the greateſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.
Many of you perhaps are aſhamed of Chriſt, take heed you be not a
ſhame to Chriſt. They are aſhamed of Chriſt that are aſhamed to appeare
in the cauſe of Chriſt; but as for you that are ſo, Chriſt hath more cauſe to
be aſhamed of you, for you are a ſhame to him.</p>
               <p>It is true, I cannot deny it but many Churches of God, and that of late
have brought ſome ſhame to Jeſus Chriſt by their diſſentions and fracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and they muſt take ſhame to themſelves, and they have taken ſhame
to themſelves, they have acknowledged it to the glory of Chriſt, and in that
regard in ſome meaſure have waſhed off that ſhame that they have brought
to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Againe further, a ſhame they are to their children. Wicked Parents are
a ſhame to their children; when a child appeareth forward, towardly, and
hopefull, and it be ſaid, Would you not wonder to ſee him ſo forward? the
father of him is a beaſtly dr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nkard, a filthy whore-monger, of a vile and
malignant ſpirit;<note place="margin">Wicked parents are a shame to their children.</note> now the child is aſhamed to heare of the evil of his father,
and of the evil of his mother. As fooliſh children are a ſhame to their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
ſo wicked Parents are a ſhame to their children. You that have gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
children take heed you be not a ſhame to them, and ſo a ſhame to
your ſelves.</p>
               <p>And then a ſhame to her ſelfe, <hi>ſhe hath plaid the harlot, ſhe hath done
ſhamefully.</hi> Wherein had ſhe done ſhamefully? I will onely mention one
particular. Certainly that ſhame of hers was eſpecially in ſubjecting Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
to carnall policie. For what did ſhe doe? what was the great ſinne of
the ten Tribes? It was this, becauſe they were afraid that if they did go up to
Jeruſalem to worſhip, <hi>the people would then depart from the houſe of Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam,
to the houſe of David,</hi> therefore out of politicall regards they would
have the worſhip ſet up at <hi>Dan and Bethel,</hi> there they would have <hi>Calves,</hi>
they muſt not goe up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the place which God had appointed to
worſhip in, but at <hi>Dan and Bethel.</hi> This was a meere politique fetch, for
they could not but acknowledg that God did require that they ſhould wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> where the Temple was, and there was no other reaſon
why they would worſhip at <hi>Dan and Bethel,</hi> but meerely out of State poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
that they might prevent the people from going backe to the houſe of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
and indeed they did profeſſe ſo much themſelves. Here then they
<hi>did ſhamfully.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Obſervation then from hence is, that for governours or any to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:42662:105"/>
Religion to policie is a ſhamefull thing. It is ſhamefull to make Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
an underling, and to make policie the head. Perhaps they call this
wiſedome, a prudentiall way, wee muſt be carefull and wiſe to foreſee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences
that may follow. But what if God give it another name?
God may give it a name of baſe temporizing, a name of folly and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
to ſubject Religion to policie it is ſhamefull, becauſe it abaſeth that
which is the great honour of any Country, it makes it an underling: what
is the excellency of man but Religion? what is the excellency of a Country
but Religion? and what hath England been glorious for more then for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion?
Now to put the excellency of a thing under any inferiour, this is
ſhamefull, to put the Crown that is for the head under ones foot is a diſhon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
to it: although a thing hath in it ſelf but little excellencie, if it be brought
beneath it ſelfe under other things that have not ſo great an excellency in
them, it makes it vile.</p>
               <p>And ſhamefull alſo it is becauſe it holdeth forth this, that we dare not truſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
God for our civill eſtate and for our peace, therefore Religion muſt come
under.</p>
               <p>Shamefull it is again becauſe it is groſſe folly, for there is no ſuch way to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
breede diſturbance in a politicke ſtate, no ſuch way to undoe a State, as to
make Religion an underling to policie. Was it not ſo here? That very way
that they tooke to uphold their policie was the way to deſtroy their State, &amp;
did deſtroy it at laſt, even their corrupting of Gods worſhip.</p>
               <p>What cauſe had they then to be aſhamed of this, that God ſhould take that
which they thought to helpe themſelves by, and make that the very thing
that ſhould cauſe their ruine? And certainly it will be ſo, they that are of the
deepeſt and politikeſt ferches and reaches, if they thinke to ſecure themſelves
and preſerve their peace, out of that principle, ſo as Religion muſt come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and muſt be ſerviceable, it will appeare at laſt they doe ſhamefully,
God will make them aſhamed of it one way or other, it will be the onely
way to undoe themſelves and us. I confeſſe in matters of Religion there are
ſome commands that are affirmitive precepts: Theſe though they doe <hi>liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
ſemper,</hi> yet not <hi>ad ſemper,</hi> there is not a neceſſity that at every time and
inſtant they ſhould be urged, ſo that it may be that a people may be in ſuch
a frame that men cannot but by degrees bring in a reformation to the height
of it, and then it is not carnall policie to bring in ſuch wayes of God gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
as are commanded by affirmitive precepts; but negative precepts binde
<hi>ſemper</hi> and <hi>adſemper,</hi> and the State muſt looke to that, that they do nothing
againſt Chriſt out of policie that they doe not hinder by any poſitive Law
the way of Chriſt, for though Chriſt may be willing to forbeare ſome Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
for a time, and he doth it out of mercy to a people, he ſaith he will
have mercy and not ſacrifice, but Chriſt will never beare that there ſhould
be any thing done againſt him in that time. If they ſhould out of any State
policie to preſerve peace, or to gratifie an evill party, ſacrifice any part of
Religion, or any godly perſon, this will prove a ſhamefull thing, Chriſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:42662:106"/>
it ſo, and whoſoever doth ſo will be aſhamed of it at the laſt.</p>
               <p>Now my brethren, why ſhould not God be truſted? let us looke at Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
in the firſt place, and ſo pray wee that thoſe who are our reformers
who have power in their hands may never prove to be guilty of this ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
way of putting Religion under policie. I will give you a notable exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in Scripture about it. It is <hi>Joſh.</hi> 5. When <hi>Joſhua</hi> had brought the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Iſrael over Jordan (that you know was the very beginning of their
entrance into Canaan) now as ſoone as they were brought unto the borders
of the Land, they were to encounter with all their enemies, and you may i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine
that when <hi>Joſhua</hi> had paſſed the river the, people might thinke that
all the Country would be about their eares, one would thinke then that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy
would have taught them to lay aſide all thoughts of Religion, and to look
to their enemies that were at hand, if ever they were outragious they would
be then, and therefore now let us minde nothing but arming our ſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them: But mark now God goeth another way to worke, as ſoone
as they were gone over Jordan, and were upon the borders of the Land of
Canaan, they muſt goe and <hi>circumciſe themſelves,</hi> and you know when
they were circumciſed they were ſore that they could not fight. <hi>Simeon</hi> and
<hi>Levi</hi> deſtroyed a whole City when they were circumciſed, they were not
then in a poſture of fighting or defending themſelves, but lay at the mercie
of their enemies. But this was Gods wiſedome. Nay further, they muſt go
and <hi>keepe the paſſeover</hi> too, they muſt mind and tend Religion: And mark
you ſhall finde in the latter end of the Chapter, that after <hi>they had been cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed
&amp; kept the Paſſeover,</hi> then <hi>appeareth one to Ioſhua with a drawn
ſword,</hi> and ſaith he, <hi>I am the Captain of the Lords Hoſts.</hi> Then the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of the Lords Hoſt appeareth to fight for them when they had once obey<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed;
whereas had they neglected Circumciſion and the Paſſeover, &amp; thought
of fighting onely, they, might have miſſed of the Captaine of the Lords
Hoſts to have fought for them, and what would have become of them then?
So you ſee God would have us minde Religion in the moſt dangerous times,
and though we thinke we muſt mind our peace and ſafety, and lay our hands
upon our ſwords <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>or our defence, yet let us be carefull of our Religion, and
then we ſhall have a Captain of the Lords hoſt come and fight for us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Marke</hi> 8. 15. we are charged to take heed of two ſorts of leaven, <hi>The
leaven of the Scribes and Phariſes,</hi> and <hi>the leaven of Herod.</hi> The leaven of
the Scribes and Phariſes is corruption in Church affairs, the leaven of <hi>Herod</hi>
is corruption in Religion too, but in order of the Common-wealth, in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
under things of God to the affairs of the State, for in this <hi>Herod</hi> was
like <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> he was affraid of his kingdome as <hi>Ieroboam</hi> was, hee had
many wayes and plots to keepe himſelfe in that kingdom as <hi>Ieroboam</hi> had,
and many did cleave to <hi>Herod</hi> in his plots, as Iſrael clave to <hi>Ieroboam</hi> in
his, therefore ſaith Chriſt, <hi>take heed</hi> not onely <hi>of the leaven of the Scribes
and Phariſes</hi> but <hi>of the leaven of Herod.</hi> And it may be the Lord ſaw us to

what it will be, it is ſhamefull: Much more then whoredome, to play the
harlot, for all ſinne doth drowne a man, it brings him beneath the excellency
of a man, it is contrary to the image of God in man, to that wherein true
honor, beauty, glory doth conſiſt. It makes men vile. I will give you but one
Text for it, <hi>Dan, 11. 21. And there ſhal ariſe a vile perſon.</hi> Who was that?
It was according to interpreters, <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> the great King of
Aſſyria, and yet <hi>a vile perſon. Joſephus</hi> tells us that the Samaritans when
they were in danger of ſuffering from him becauſe he thought them to be
Jewes, they wrote to him in this manner. <hi>To Antiochus the mighty God;</hi>
and his very Epithet, <hi>Epiphanes,</hi> is as much in our Engliſh as <hi>Illuſtrious,</hi>
Antiochus the Illuſtrious, the famous, bright in his glory: He that was ſo
illuſtrious and ſo great a Prince, that was written unto as the mighty God,
yet in the Scripture language being wicked he is <hi>a vile perſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a ſpecial note of one that is fit <hi>to dwell in Gods Mountain,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sin cauſeth shame.</note> of one that

becauſe it deceiveth a man, <hi>The way of the wicked ſhall deceive him, What

ſigne of grace to be able to ſee into the deceits of ſinne, ſo as to be aſhamed

either bodily or ſpiritual.</p>
               <p>Firſt bodily, the expreſſion of <hi>ſhamefulneſſe</hi> though eſpecially it aymeth
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:42662:107"/>
at their Idolatry, yet it hath its riſe from bobily whoredome, if that were
not ſhamefull, the expreſſion could not be full; that ſhe had <hi>played the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot,</hi>
and <hi>done ſhamefully,</hi> Pro. 6. 32. <hi>Whoſo committeth adultery with a
woman, lacketh underſtanding, he that doth it deſtroyeth his own ſoul; a

It makes one to be as one of the fooles in Iſrael. <hi>And I</hi> (ſaith <hi>Tamer</hi> when
<hi>Amnon defiled</hi> her) <hi>whether ſhall I cauſe my ſhame to go? and as for thee

<hi>as one of the fooles in Iſrael,</hi> Deut. 23. 18. <hi>Thou ſhalt not bring the
hire of a whore, nor the price of a dogge into the houſe of the Lord;</hi> they are
joyned both together, for Scripture language makes thoſe to be <hi>doggs</hi> who
are uncleane and filthy. When <hi>Iſhboſheth</hi> charged <hi>Abner</hi> with the ſinne of
uncleanneſſe, 2 <hi>Sam. 3. 8. Am I a dogs head,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that thou chargeſt
me with a fault concerning this woman?</hi> Many Adulterers goe very fine
and ſpruce, many young wantons are bravely dreſt, but in Gods eſteeme
they are as dogges thorough their uncleanneſs. It is not a harſher title then
the ſpirit of God gives them. I have read of a people amongſt the heathen
that condemned this ſinne with death, and with a ſhamefull death according
to the nature of the ſinne, the death was this, they would have the adulterers
or adultereſſes head to be put into the paunch of a beaſt, where lay all the
filth and uncleanneſſe of it, and there to be ſtifled to death, a puniſhment fit
for ſo filthy a ſinne. And as this ſin is ever ſhamefull, ſo eſpecially the more
lovely any yoke fellow is that is forſaken, and the more vile and fowle the
whore is, ſo much the more ſhamefull is the ſin: <hi>Athenaeus</hi> bringes in <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi>
bewayling himſelf in his own condition, that he was taken ſo much with
a filthy whore. It is more ſhamefull for Chriſtians then for heathens, becauſe
they know that the covenant of mariage is the <hi>covenant of God,</hi> as <hi>Pro.</hi> 2. 17.</p>
               <p>But further, corruption in Gods worſhip is moſt ſhamefull, for that is
aymed at eſpecially here. The ſhamefulneſs of corrupting the worſhip of
God is expreſt in that moſt famous Text we have for this purpoſe. <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.
25. <hi>Aaron made the people naked unto their ſhame,</hi> how was that, but
by falſe worſhip though it was of the true God? In falſe worſhip, there is
ſhame becauſe in that a man ſubjects his conſcience to vile things.</p>
               <p>Conſcience that is not to be ſubject to any creature, only unto God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
is here made ſubject to low and vile things. Indeed it is not ſhamefull
to ſubject our conſciences to God in the uſe of creatures though never ſo
meane appointed by himſelfe, but thoſe that doe ſubject unto creatures in
wayes of falſe worſhip not appointed by God, ſubject not their conſciences
to God but unto thoſe creatures, and that is ſhamefull.</p>
               <p>In falſe worſhip though there may ſeeme to be a great deale of humility,
yet there is notorious pride and preſumption,<note place="margin">Falſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

and is not this ſhamefull.</p>
               <p>Further it is extreame folly, for we contradict our ſelves when we thinke

                  <hi>You have an excellent Scripture for this,</hi> Ezek. 43. 10. 11. Sonne of man
ſhew the houſe to the houſe of Iſrael, that they may be aſhamed of their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities,

thereof, and all the formes thereof, and all the Lawes thereof, and all the
Ordinances thereof, and write it in their ſight that they may keepe the whole
for me thereof, and all the ordinances thereof and doe them.</p>
               <p>Marke my brethren, you ſee how God ſtandeth much upon formes, <hi>all the
formes thereof,</hi> and <hi>the forme thereof:</hi> Let not us ſlightly account of any
thing in Gods worſhip, of circumſtances for God ſtandeth much upon his
own forme in his own worſhip. Many who have no Religion but a forme,
yet neglect Gods forme. Men love to ſtand much upon their owne forms,
let them know God ſtands much upon his formes, and it is no hinderance
but a furtherance to the power of Religion to keep cloſe to Gods forme, and
if we would come to know what are Gods Ordinances (we cry out, O that
we could but know what is the right way) this is one way for you to know:
Firſt, be aſhamed of what you have done, be aſhamed of your former falſe
worſhip, and then God will ſhew you the Ordinances of his Houſe, and the
true beauty of his true worſhip: till then there are ſo many diſtinctions,
and evaſions, and objections that they never come to underſtand it: when

decency, that is all they plead for; well, afterward it riſeth from decency
to ſignificancy, that is a little higher, to put them in minde. Thirdly, from
ſignificancy it riſeth to efficacy, to ſtirre up the dull mind of man: Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
from efficacy, it riſeth to neceſſity, that now it muſt be done, and the
worſhip of God cannot be without it, and there ſhall be no ordinance, no

therefore take this one inſtruction with you, be not too ready to rebuke and
chaſtiſe your ſervants, your children, in reproachfull manner before others,
left you bring them to that, that they ſhall ſee they have no honour to loſe,
and then there is little hope of them: Evermore keep ſuch a hand over your

they may not be ſo aſhamed by you, as for them to thinke they cannot be

to grow deſperate as that is. It is very great wiſedome in Governours to
keepe the bridle of ſhame ſtill, and not to let thoſe raines goe, and this is the
reaſon that your Bride-well or Goale-birds ſeldome or never come to

all their honour and they can loſe no more, and there is no rational creature
but would have honour, there is not the meaneſt ſervant you have but hath

               <p>
                  <hi>But how doth he prove that it is ſhamefull? Thus,</hi> For ſhe hath ſaid, I

               <p>This is a proofe of her ſhamefulneſſe, becauſe that which ſhe hath done ſhe
hath done upon deliberation,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> ſhe ſaid ſhe would do thus and thus, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered

               <p>Secondly, <hi>She hath ſaid I will goe.</hi> Whoredome either bodily or ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
is uſually very wilfull: as if ſhe had ſaid, let all the Prophets ſay what
they can, let them talke out their hearts, I will have my minde, I will follow
my lovers ſtill. Thus it is with bodily whoredome. Thoſe who are guilty
of this uſually grow extreame wilfull. <hi>Prov. 2. 19. None that goe unto

               <p>
                  <hi>You have a notable Text for that,</hi> Jer. 44. 16. 17. <hi>the people ſay there,</hi>

               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> wilfulneſſe in any ſinne, but eſpecially in theſe ſinnes, is a very

men in place and of eſtates are not able to endure the controlling of
their will in any thing, and therefore when their wills are but croſt, they
burſt out into outragious ſpeeches, and fall a blaſpheeming, and ſwearing,

               <p>Thus we find it in the people of Iſrael, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. 19, when <hi>Samuel</hi> from

Thoſe whom God leaveth to hardneſſe of heart, and intendeth ruine to,
he uſually giveth them up to this wilfulneſſe in their evill wayes.</p>
               <p>The Scripture records <hi>Pharaoh</hi> for a famons example of one hardned
and prepared for ruine. He was of a moſt wilfull ſpirit. <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. 9. you

me, if you beſet upon your will, go and ſerve your idols, and take your fill
of your own wayes. And <hi>Pſal. 81. 11. My people would not hearken to

will have your owne counſels, and your own will, and ſo God giveth you up
to them, and then woe to you, you are undone.</p>
               <p>Secondly, you that are ſet upon your wils in that which is evil, know God
is and will be as wilful toward you as you can be toward him. Marke that

and fulfilled with your hands, ſaying, We will ſurely perform the vowes wee

you will ſurely accompliſh your vowes, and ſurely performe your vowes;</hi> you

in any thing, my brethren, be reſolute in that which is good, be reſolute in

               <p>Fourthly, <hi>For ſhe ſaid:</hi> She profeſt what ſhe would do. Profeſt ſinnes
are ſhamefull ſins. It is an evill for ſin to lye lurking in any ones heart, but
for ſin to breake out into open profeſſion, this certainly is a great evil: This
is to prove that ſhe had done ſhamefully,<note place="margin">Profeſsed wickedneſs is ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs.</note> becauſe ſhe ſaid ſhe would doe ſo
and ſo. There is a great deceite in the hearts of many men, they are ready
to ſay, I were as good ſay ſo as thinke ſo, I ſay ſo, and perhaps others think
ſo, it were as good for me to ſpeake it as to keepe it in my heart. My bre
thren there are two deceits in this kind of ſpeaking.</p>
               <p>Firſt you ſuppoſe that when you ſpeak ſo, that therefore it is not in your
heart, and you make this compariſon of what is in other mens hearts, and in
your mouthes, as if the evil were in your mouthes onely, and in their hearts
onely, as if the compariſon lay thus, they think and doe not ſpeak, and you
ſpeak and doe not thinke. Here is the deceit, for if you ſpeake you have it in
your hearts too, you both ſpeak and think, for ſo the Scripture telleth us, that
<hi>out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth ſpeaketh;</hi> if you ſpeak malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
you have a malicious heart, if you ſpeake uncleanly, you have an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane
heart, if oathes be in your mouthes, you have a profane heart.</p>
               <p>Secondly, here lyeth the deceit, as if you ſhould have leſſe in your heart
becauſe you vent it; as your paſſionate people will ſay, I were as good vent
my minde and then I ſhall be quiet. Thou deceiveſt thy ſelfe; the venting
of the corruption that lyeth in thy heart will never leſſen it but increaſe it.</p>
               <p>It is not with the corruption of our hearts, as it is with liquor in a veſſell,
that the more is let out the leſſe is within it; but as it is with a fire in a houſe,
that when it is kindled within and burſtech out, there is not leſſe within be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it burſteth out, no, the more it burſteth out and flames, the more ſtill

the fountain, there is never a whit the leſſe water in the fountain, it may rather
have the leſſe by ſtopping, and fire may be leſſened by ſmothering. Know
therefore that profeſſed wickedneſs it is aggravated wickedneſſe. It is true,
ſecret ſins may be more dangerous in regard of the cure, but they are more
abominable to God in regard of the open diſhonour that is done to him by
them. The aggravation of the blood that was ſhed by the people, that God
ſpeakes of, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24. 7. it is ſet out thus, <hi>The bloud that was ſhed,</hi> ſaith the

he ſaith in that place of <hi>Iſa. Chap. 3. 9. They declared their ſin as Sodome,
and hid it not: Woe unto her ſoul,</hi> ſaith he, woe unto them when they ſhall
preſume to declare their ſin as Sodome. And as I ſaid before, God will be
as wilfull in puniſhing a ſinner, as a ſinner is wilfull inſinning; ſo here God
will be as profeſſed in plauging, as thou ſhalt be profeſſed in ſinning for thy

               <p>I knew once one that was noble both in birth and grace, and having to doe
oftentimes with thoſe of his ranke, greatones, that would be ſcorning at
Religion under the name of putirrniſme, he would uſually take this courſe,
when he was to come into ſuch company he would begin himſelfe &amp; owne
himſelfe to be one of thoſe that they called a Puritan, and ſo he prevented
them, and by that meanes prevented much ſin in them, and much ſcorne of
Religion by thus owning of it. It is certain, that the beſt way for the hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of Religion it for every one to owne it, though there be ignominous
termes put upon it. If ever we were called to profeſſion of what we doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
we are now called to it in theſe dayes. Certainly God profeſſeth for

in the eyes before the faces of our adverſaries. Let us not onely have
God in our hearts, but profeſſe his name openly before the faces of our adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries.
It is time now to do it.<note place="margin">It is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to have good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſse at the heart, but we muſt profeſse it.</note> It had beenewell if. you had profeſſed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
when Gods truth called for it. It may be many of you may be found

to profeſſe of what party you are, that as wee reade of <hi>Jonah</hi> Chapter 9.
when he was in the ſtorme, and the marriners awaking he ſaith unto them,
<hi>I am an Hebrew that feare the God of heaven, which made the ſea and the

               <p>My brethren, if we be not in a preſent ſtorme, yet the clouds grow black,
therefore awake you ſluggards, you that are ſecure awake out of your ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,

whatſoever they talke of ſuch and ſuch men under ſuch ignominious terms

               <p>Idolaters uſe to keepe good thoughts of their Idols. They call them their

uſed to call them <hi>Baalim,</hi> from <hi>Baal,</hi> a <hi>husband.</hi> So it ſhould be the care
of the Saints, evermore to keep good thoughts of God, to look upon God as
their Lover, as one that tendereth their good. Idolaters doe ſo to their Idols,
ſhall not the Saints do ſo to the true God? My brethren, let us not be ready
to entertain hard thoughts of God, it is a dangerous thing. Gods great care
is to manifeſt to us, and to all the world that he loveth us, and he hath done
much to manifeſt to us here in England,<note place="margin">Wee muſt keepe good thoughts of God.</note> and to our brethren of Scotland,
that he loveth us and them. In <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 9. the Text ſaith of the Church of

               <p>I will give you for this (becauſe it is a point of ſuch concernment) foure
notable expresſions in Scripture about Idolaters eagerneſs and earneſtneſs of
ſpirit in following after their Idols.</p>
               <p>The firſt is <hi>Iſa,</hi> 57. 5. The Text ſaith there, that they were <hi>inflamed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
their Idols,</hi> they were on fire after them.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. 38. They were <hi>madde upon their Idols.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, You have a text more ſutable to that I am ſpeaking of; It is <hi>Iſa</hi>
46. 6. it is ſaid there, <hi>that they did lavi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h gold out of the bagga.</hi> They did
not onely give their gold rings that were of no uſe, and part with that which
they could well ſpare, but they did laviſh gold that was in the bagge: they
would not onely bring ſome of it, but they did <hi>laviſh</hi> it, for ſo the word is;
and they laviſhed not their ſilver but their <hi>gold,</hi> and that not a piece or two
out of a paper, but <hi>out of the bagge,</hi> they brought their bagges of gold, and
did laviſh gold out of them, and this they did for their Idols, Oh what a
ſhame is it then that any ſhould be penurious, and not come off full in the
publicke cauſe of the Church and Common-wealth?</p>
               <p>The fourth Text is <hi>Jerem.</hi> 8. 2. and there we have five expresſions toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the purſuance of the heart of Idolaters after their Idols, the like wee
have not in all the booke of God in one verſe. Speaking of their Idols. Firſt
he ſaith, <hi>whom they have loved.</hi> Secondly, <hi>whom they have ſerved.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>after whom they have walked.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>whom they have ſought.</hi> And
Fifthly, <hi>whom they have worſhipped:</hi> and all this in this one verſe,
O how are the hearts of people ſet upon the wayes of Idolatry! I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

               <p>Maſter <hi>Calvin</hi> in a Sermon of his upon that Text <hi>ſeeke ye my face,</hi> hath
this expreſſion. Fooliſh Idolaters when they endure much in their pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages
ſpend their money, waſte their bodies, and abuſed in their travail,
yet they goe on, and thinke all ſufficiently recompenced, if they may ſee and
worſhip ſome Image of a Saint or holy relicke: Shall the beholding, ſaith
he, ſome dead carrion or apiſh Idol have more power to ſtrengthen them

               <p>My lovers that gave me my bread and my water, my wool and my flaxe,
mine oyle and my drinke.</p>
               <p>What were theſe Idols? The Idol that gave their <hi>bread</hi> was <hi>Caeres,</hi> ſhee
was the goddeſſe that the Heathens did worſhip for corne. For their <hi>water,
Luna,</hi> the Moone was the Idol they worſhipped for their drinke, and all

               <p>So they, though their Idols gave them all, flaxe, and wool, and hempe and

in the plural number. The idols of the Heathen do not ſupply all good,
but one one thing, and another another thing. And that is the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the true God and Idols. The excellency of the true God is, that he is
an univerſal good, we have all good, flaxe, and oyle, and bread, and wine,
and all in one, in our God, in our lover. And that is the reaſon that God
chalengeth the whole heart. Idols are content with a partiall obedience, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are but partiall in beſtowing of good things, but God juſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
the whole heart of his worſhippers, becauſe he is an univerſall good
to them.</p>
               <p>My Lovers that gave me my bread, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Marke, The end that Idolaters ay me at in their worſhip is very low.</p>
               <p>They follow their lovers and are very earneſt, for what <hi>I</hi> pray? for their
wool, and their flaxe, and their bread, and their water, their oyle and their
drinke. Theſe are the things they aime at; they deſire no more, they look no
higher, may their fleſh be ſatisfied, give them but-liberty to ſport on the
Lords day, to have their feaſts, their wakes, merry meetings and they care
for no more. Their ſpirits are vile, and accordingly is their worſhip. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their worſhip is external, it is bodily, becauſe their aimes are at exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
and bodily things. As a mans end is, ſo is a man, either baſe or honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.
There are many men that cry out as if they aimed at God and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
in many things they doe, they make a noiſe about Religion, and God,
and Chriſt, and his Ordinances, and the publicke good, but the truth is, their
aimes are at gaine and credit, and at their wool and their flaxe, and herein
they ſhew the baſeneſs of their ſpirits, like the lapwings that make a loud

of God is a great deale higher, they ſoare aloft, there is a ſpirituall
heighth of ſoule whereby they are raiſed upwards by the grace of God. A
godly mans feete are where a wicked mans head is, that which he account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his chiefe good, a godly man can trample under his feete. He lookes at
God himſelfe, at his ſervice, he worſhippeth the high God: he is a child of

eſpecially in matters of Religion, for wool, and flax, and oile, he hath no ſuch
low and baſe ends, but at God, and Chriſt, and heaven, and glory, and i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality,
he lookes there; he ſerves God not for theſe things, hee deſires
theſe things, that by them he may be fitted more to ſerve God. One that
hath beene acquainted with the free grace of God in Chriſt will ſerve God
for himſelfe without indenting with him, he will be willing to go into Gods
Vineyard, and not indent for a penny a day. You that will indent with
God in his ſervice and will have your penny, you who have ſuch low and

                  <note place="margin">Men love that Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that brings them moſt corne and wine, &amp;c.</note> Hence it followes, that that way of Religion that men can get

aime at no higher things. That way of Religion that moſt eſtate is got by,
that can pleaſe the ſence, that is the Religion that pleaſes moſt people. It is
the ſpeech of one <hi>Pamchtius</hi> an Heathen, Make me a Biſhop, ſaith he, and

the reaſon, ſaith he, the Pope hath a great many places of preferment and

notoble ſtory of one that he knew that lived like a Noole man by his many
Eccleſiaſticall preferments, who when he was at his table, and bread and

moſt in the world, arguments taken from bread, and flaxe, and wool
and oyle, are ſtronger arguments then any taken from the Scripture, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing taken from the honour of the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt, When
men can come with <hi>Sauls</hi> arguments, 1 <hi>Sam. 22. 7. Will the ſonne of Jeſſe

what preferment will you get this way? you may get preſerment in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way, this drawes, this prevails. It was a ſpeech, not many yeers agoe,
in a publicke Commencement at Cambridge, made by the Vice-Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,

               <p>Hence the poverty of Chriſt is great ſcandall and offence to moſt people,
when they ſee that Religion will not bring them flaxe, and wool, and oyle,
but that they muſt live poorely, they ſcandalize at this exceedingly.</p>
               <p>It is reported in the ſtory of <hi>Charles</hi> the great, that he having war with an
heathen King, <hi>Aygolandus</hi> King of <hi>Africa,</hi> becauſe this King would
make peace with <hi>Charles,</hi> hee made ſome profeſſion as if hee would be a
Chriſtian, and <hi>Charles</hi> was very glad of this, and got him to his Court to
parley with him; being in his Court he ſaw 30. poore people that <hi>Charles</hi>
fed, who were halt, and may med, and blind, and in a very poore garb,
<hi>Charles</hi> the great did it on purpoſe, becauſe he would have poverty before
his eyes continually, that hee might not be too high in, and proud of his
proſperity. Now when <hi>Aygolandus</hi> ſaw them, who are theſe ſaith hee?
Theſe ſaith <hi>Charles</hi> are the ſervants of God: nay then replyed he, if your
God will keep his ſervants no better, I will be none of his; I thought to be
a Chriſtian, and to ſerve your God, but ſeeing thoſe that ſerve him have
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:42662:116"/>
no better food nor no better rayment then theſe, I will be none of thoſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.
Thus it is with many, thought their conſciences are convinced which
is the beſt way, yet becauſe of the want of flaxe, and wool, and oyle, they
will not come off.</p>
               <p>Further obſerve,</p>
               <p>It is a ſhamefull thing for men to make Religion to be in ſubjection to
their wool,<note place="margin">Obſer</note> and corne, &amp; oyle. They have done ſhamefully in this. Many wil
do this,<note place="margin">It is a shamefull thing to ſubiect Re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ligion to corn, wine, and flaxe, and wool.</note> but this is very ſhamefull. Before I ſhewed that it is ſhamefull to
ſubject Religion to politique affairs, to the publique State of a Kingdome,
but now to ſubject Religion to our owne baſe ſenſualities, to our own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
ends, for profit and preferment, oh this is very ſhamefull. Gain got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
this way, it is filthy lucre, as the Scripture ſaith of it, yet <hi>hujuſmodi lucri
dulcis odor,</hi> the ſmell of this gaine is very ſweet unto many. What, is thy
Religion ſerviceable to gain, to a trade, to ſenſuall luſts? what is this but
to ſtop the holes of a mudd wall with diamonds and precious pearls? That
were a folly you will ſay, that becauſe you have a hole to be ſtopped in a
mud wall, to put in diamonds and pearls to ſtop it, and to make ſuch preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
things ſerviceable to ſuch baſe ends, thou doſt as much, thou wouldſt
have that which ſhall be a content to thy fleſh, and thou wilt make Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſubject to that, thou art as baſe and vile in this. Religion my brethren
is the glory of a man, the glory of a nation, and ſhall we turn this glory into
ſhame? It is a baſe thing in Magiſtrates to ſubject the acts of juſtice to
their baſe ends, for gain and profit; for a Judge, or a Juſtice of peace, or a
Prelate to ſhew moſt favour where there is moſt flaxe, and wool, and oyle,
where Butts, or rundlers of Sack, or the like are to be got, this is baſeneſſe in
them: But to ſubject Religion to ſuch baſe ends as theſe, this is the villany
of all baſeneſſe. A generous ſpirit is far from this. It is obſerved of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous

oyle, as if God would not give bread to his Church, or as if it were more ſafe
to goe to the Devill for it, as if we could not have wool enough, and flaxe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
and oyle enough from God. Oh let us truſt God for all, for our
cloaths, for our meate and drink, for our eſtates, for our children, God cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
will feede his Church. And yet thoſe men that have hearts ſo baſe
themſelves, they thinke it impoſſible for any man but to be taken with ſuch
arguments: They may talke of Religion and conſcience ſay they, but I will
warrant you they may be taken off with money, and preferment, places of
profit and honour. They think it impoſſible for men to ſtand againſt theſe
arguments. It putteth me in mind of that ſpeech that <hi>Balaak</hi> uſed to <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam,
Did not I earneſtly ſend unto thee to call thee, wherefore cameſt
thou not unto me? Am I not able to promote thee to honour?</hi> As if he
ſhould have ſaid, Thou art a ſtrange man indeed, did not I ſend thee word
that I would promote thee to great honour, and give thee ſilver and gold, or
whatſoever thou wouldſt have? What will not preferment and money
tempt you? I thought this would have tempted any man in the world. Thus
many think that whatſoever mens Spirits are, they may be taken off with
promotion and money: But let all ſuch know that there are a generation of
men in the world of true generous Spirits, that are above all theſe things,
and take as much delight, and have as much ſweetneſſe in denying theſe
places of honour and preferment, and gaine, as thoſe that offer them have in
the enjoying of them. It was a notable ſpeech <hi>Plynie</hi> had concerning <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>
(It is in his Epiſtle Dedicatory to his naturall Hiſtory) ſpeaking of what
a notable ſpirit he was, <hi>Cato</hi> (ſaith he) tooke as much glory in thoſe digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and honours that he denyed, as he did in thoſe he did enjoy, Certainly
it is ſo with the Saints, the true generous ſpirit of Chriſtians take as much
content in thoſe places of preferment they deny for Chriſt, as in any gaine
they enjoy. There is no tempting of ſuch men.</p>
               <p>Let us pray therefore for thoſe that are intruſted by us, not onely for ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
things, but for matters of Religion, that temptations for bread, &amp; corne,
and wool, and flaxe, and wine, and oilemay never tempt them, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment,

proſpetous, after he had ended his journey, hee boaſted himſelfe that
though he did not worſhip the gods as others did, yet he proſpered as much

brought in amongſt us, eſpecially in that Dioceſe of <hi>Norwich,</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be a very fruitfull yeere; and one Commiſſary among the reſt in his
Court, after the harveſt was taken in, ſpeakes to the Countrey-men in this
way, Doe you not ſee how God proſpereth us? What a plentifull harveſt
have we had this yeere? This is ſince you began to worſhip God with more
decency then you we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  <pb n="231" facs="tcp:42662:117"/>
Further, It is very obſervable how often this word My is iterated: Give
me My bread, and My water, and My flax, and My oyle, and My wooll,
nothing but My. We noted the laſt day, what hurt thoſe little words, thoſe
particles [<hi>I</hi>] and [<hi>Will</hi>] doe: Now we are to conſider what evil there is in
this particle [<hi>MY</hi>]</p>
               <p>Hence the obſervation is,<note place="margin">Obſ.</note> That carnall heatts looke upon what they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
as their owne, and thinke they may uſe it as their owne; and eſpecially
ſuch as are Idolaters. Though they will acknowledge that that they have
commeth from the Idols, (as here they did, for they ſaid their <hi>Lovers</hi> gave it
them, yet when they had theſe things, they thought they might do with them
what they would, then they were theirs, Mine, and mine, and all is mine.</p>
               <p>Thus it is uſual for carnall ſpirits to acknowledge in the general that that
they have commeth from God, but when they have it, then it is their owne
they think; they little thinke that God reſerveth the propriety of what they
have after he hath given it them. You miſtake if you think that that is all the
acknowledgement you owe to God for what you enjoy, that you had it
from God;<note place="margin">God reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in all that he giveth, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us.</note> but you muſt acknowledg like wiſe that God reſerveth his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
after he hath given it you. God doth never give any thing in that way
that one friend giveth to another; a friend may give you a gift, yet when
you have it, it is your owne, and you may uſe it as you pleaſe, your friend
parteth with his own propriety. God never giveth any thing ſo, as to part
with his own propriety; though he hath given it you, yet you cannot ſay it
is <hi>Mine,</hi> in reſpect of God, it is ſtill his. There is no ſuch bond upon conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
as to uſe all the comforts we have for God as this, &amp; ſee that all comes
from him in the way of a covenant of grace. I ſay this it is that will lay a
bond upon conſcience, to make uſe of your eſtates, and of all you enjoy for
God, and not thinke to employ them for your own ends: It is not the ſlight
acknowledgement that Idolaters have, that all comes from God, will doe
it; Carnal men looke upon that they have, comming from God through ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
cauſes, and no further; but a Chriſtian lookes upon that which he hath
as coming from God in a covenant of grace, and this engageth the heart
ſtrongly to uſe all for God, from whom all is received in ſuch a way.</p>

                  <hi>Verſe</hi> 6. Therefore behold, I will hedge up thy way with thornes, and
make a wall, that ſhe ſhall not finde her paths, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Theſe two verſes are the workings of Gods bowels of mercy towards his
Elect amongſt Iſrael, in the midſt of the moſt dreadfull threatnings againſt
her. They are as it were a <hi>Parentheſis</hi> of grace (in the Chapter) to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
though mingled with ſome ſeverity.</p>
               <p>They are indeed the Epitome of the whole Chapter, for I told you
in the diviſion of the Chapter at the beginning, that thoſe were the two
parts, declaring Iſraels ſinne, with threatning judgement, and yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing
mercy unto the Elect, unto ſome amongſt them. The firſt part is
from the beginning to the 14. verſe, the ſecond from the 14. verſe to the
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:42662:118"/>
end; Only this 6. and 7. <hi>ver.</hi> commeth in the midſt, as it were a parenthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,
and containeth the ſum of all the other; for hee was in a threatning way
altogether in the 4. and 5. <hi>verſes,</hi> and you ſhall finde him in the 8. <hi>verſ.</hi> and

of grace, though mixed with ſome ſeverity, as you ſhall ſee in the
opening of them.</p>

               <p>

to a <hi>Wherefore,</hi> Therefore, Wherefore? <hi>Becauſe</hi> I have dealt with you
by the way of my Prophets; in convincing, in admoniſhing, in threatning,
and all this will not doe, <hi>therefore</hi> I will deale with you in another way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore behold.</hi>] That way of mine that I now ſpeak of, it is a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar

way that I will deale with you in now, <hi>Behold.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>I will hedge up thy way.</hi>] There is a two-fold <hi>hedge</hi> that God makes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
his people; There is <hi>the hedge of protection</hi> to keep evill from them,
and there is <hi>the hedge of affliction</hi> to keep them from evill.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the hedge of protection, that you have in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5. 5. where God
threatneth that he will <hi>take away the hedge from his vineyard,</hi> he will take
away his protection; and ſo it is ſaid of <hi>Job,</hi> that <hi>God had hedged him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout;</hi>
but that is not the hedg heer meant, it is the hedg of affliction. <hi>I will
hedge up thy way,</hi> that is, I will bring fore and heavy afflictions upon you,
but yet in a way of mercy, theſe afflictions ſhall be but as a hedge to keepe
you from evill, they ſhall not do evill to you, or bring evill upon you.</p>
               <p>

on in theſe wayes of Idolatry and falſe worſhip, I will make them difficult
to you, you ſhall goe through thornes; if you will goe to your Idols, you
ſhall not get to your Idols, but you ſhall be pricked. It is a Metaphor ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from a husband-man, who when the cattle will break over paſtures,
makes thick hedges that they ſhall not get over, they ſhall be pricked, it
ſhal be with much trouble if they do goe over. So I will deal with you ſaith
God. Or when a husband-man ſeeth paſſengers make a path in his ground
too broad, and ſo ſpoile the graſſe or the corn, hee layeth thornes in the
way that they cannot goe into his corne; or if they doe, they ſhall goe
with ſome trouble: ſo ſaith God, <hi>I will hedge up your way with thorns.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And make a wall.</hi>] <hi>Maceriabo Maceriam, I will wall a wall,</hi> ſo the
words are. It may be they will get through the thorns, but though they do
get through I have another way to deale with them, I will come with ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
afflictions and they ſhall be of more power to keepe them from their
ſame, they ſhal be as a wall, and though they get through the thorns, they
ſhal not get over the wall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That ſhe ſhall not find her paths.</hi>] Mark the change of the perſon, that is

of ſpeech is uſuall amongſt men when their ſpirits are troubled, they
ſpeak ſometimes in one perſon, ſometimes in another: And indeed the Lord
here ſpeaks after the manner of men, as if his Spirit were troubled at the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſſe
of his people. Beſides the change of the perſon here is to expreſſe
ſome indignation of God againſt their perverſeneſſe, therefore he ſpeakes as
if he would turn from them, and rather ſpeake to ſome body elſe, as if hee
ſhould ſay, I ſpeake to theſe, yet they are ſtubborn and ſtout, well I will
ſpeake to all that are about them, to all the beholders, take notice of their
ſtubborneſſe, and perverſneſſe, and judge between them and me.</p>

the Seventy turn it.</p>
               <p>Yea, and beſide the form of the word, it being (in <hi>Piel</hi>) that ſignifieth to
do a thing auxiouſly, and diligently, carefully, whereas (in <hi>Cal.</hi>) it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
onely a bare doing of a thing: but when it commeth into forme, as
thoſe that are skilfull in the Hebrew tongue know that fignifieth to doe a
thing with care, that ſolicitiouſneſſe, and diligence, ſo therefore it is turned by
<hi>Polanus, anxie proſecutus eſt, She hath proſecuted or followed with a great

have grievouſly ſinned againſt me in forſaking me, and following of your
lovers, ſore and heavy evills are ready to befall you, even you my elect ones,
upon whom my heart is for good, you have involved your ſelves in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
guilt of this wickedneſſe, therefore even you muſt expect to be invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in the common calamity that ſhall come upon the nation, and when
you are under thoſe calamities, know that I know how to make a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
between ſinner and ſinner, though guilty of the ſame ſin, though under
the ſame affliction, that what ſhall be for the deſtruction of ſome, ſhall be
in mercy to others, it ſhall be but to hedg up your ways, to keep you from
further ſinning, to make your wayes of ſinne difficult, that ſo your ſoules
might be ſaved: and although your hearts will be a long time perverſe, and
will not come in and ſubmit to me, yet I will ſo order things in the way of
my providence, that at length I will ſo worke upon your hearts, that you
ſhall come in and return unto me, you ſhal bethink your ſelves and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

               <p>Though ſuch as are in covenant with God may for their ſins be involved

them and others that are not in covenant with him: God will have other

though the difference be not in the things that they ſuffer,<note place="margin">Iſa. 27. 4</note> yet the difference
is very broad and wide in the ends for which they ſuffer. When the <hi>bryars</hi>
and <hi>thornes</hi> are ſet before God, it is that they may be deſtroyed, the fire of
Gods anger paſſeth through them to deſtroy them; but when God cometh

though the affliction be the ſame to ſence and view with that of the wicked,
yet you ſee the difference is broad. It is true, may the troubled heart ſay,
there may be different ends of Gods afflicting ſome &amp; others; hee may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
ſome for tryall, and others for their ſins; but what will you ſay if an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
come upon us for our ſins? Is there a difference here? Yes my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
though your afflictions come upon you from your ſins, if you be in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
with God, the difference ſtill may hold, for ſo it is here, thoſe afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that here are ſpoken of, God calleth the hedge and the wall, they were
fore afflictions, and they were for their ſins, for their perverſneſs, and yet
God intendeth good and mercy to them in thoſe afflictions: Here is the
vertue of the Covenant of grace, it takes out the ſting, and venome, and curſe
even of afflictions, that are not onely for tryal but for ſin, they are to keepe
you from greater miſery; if God bring ſome miſery upon you (it ſo appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
unto you) yet being in covenant with him, this is the bleſſing of God u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
you, that thoſe troubles are to keep you from greater miſery that would
befall you. That for the general.</p>
               <p>Now for the particulars, as the words lye, <hi>Therefore behold.</hi> This infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<hi>therefore</hi> I told you it was as if God ſhould ſay, thou wilt ſtill goe on,

the elect of God will many times do ſo, this is a ſore and grievous evill that
it ſhould be ſaid ſo of them, for if there be ingenuity in the ſpirit of men, the
very notice of the minde of God is enough to cauſe the heart to yeeld, and
ſurely grace doth make the heart of a man ingenuous, and God expects that

yet behold even in the hearts of the godly many times there remaineth ſo
much ſlaviſhneſſe, that they will not come in but upon Gods dealing very
hardly with them, they muſt have many afflictions, they muſt be whipped
home before they will returne home, God muſt ſend the dog many times to
worry his ſheepe before they will come in. This God complains of <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.

many, even of the Saints when we ſee how the wayes and dealings of God

a ſervant? is he a ſlave? is not ſuch a one my child? how is it then that hee
muſt be dealt with like a ſlave, like a ſervant?</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Therefore,</hi> becauſe one meanes will not do it, namely my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets

on work to look after other meanes. What will not this do it? Is there any
things elſe that poſſibly may doe it? That means then ſhall be uſed. Thus
God (as we may ſpeak with reverence) even ſtudyes his adminiſtrations to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his people when he is fruſtrated in one, and if that do not do it, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks

caſt off his people, becauſe they ſtand out againſt him in the uſe of one

yet God tryeth one meanes after another, and after that another.</p>
               <p>This is the grace of God towards his own.</p>
               <p>It ſhould be our care to imitate God in this, when you are to deale with
others that are under you, with your children or ſervants, do not ſatisfie your
ſelves in this, I have admoniſhed them, and threatned them, and perſwaded
them, What then? yet they will not come in: What will you have no more
to do with them then? Will you caſt them off preſently? You ſhould ſtudy
what further courſe may be taken, ſtudy their diſpoſitions, What do I think
will work upon them if this do not? will faire meanes? will foule meanes?
vvill any thing do it? if any thing will, you ſhould labour to deale with them
that way. So for your own hearts, when you are convinced of the evill of
your own hearts, it is true your conſciences will not be quiet unleſſe you uſe
ſome meanes againſt that ſinne that is in your heart, well, but I have uſed
meanes, I have layed the word to my heart, the threatnings, the promiſes to
my heart, and I have followed Gods ordinances: will it not doe? will not
my heart come off? Is there no other meanes to be uſed? what doe you ſay
to the afflicting of your ſoule? Try that; you have layed the word to your
heart, and you finde it doth not work, try the afflicting of your ſoules in
humilliations, faſting, and prayer, for the overcoming of your ſinnes.</p>
               <p>Thus God doth, when admonitions and exhortations of the Prophets

that <hi>the way of the ſlothfull man</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>as an hedge of thornes;</hi> that
is, a ſlothfull man (who is a wicked man there) hee lookes upon any duty
that he ſhould perform as compaſt about with an hedge of thornes, God in

I ſee I muſt ſuffer thus and thus, there are theſe and theſe ſtumbling blocks

ſtumbling blocks God layes in the way of godlineſſe before the wicked, and
they ſtumble at them &amp; fall, and break their necks. On the other ſide, God
in abundance of mercy caſteth ſtumbling blocks in the way of ſin before his
people that they cannot get over, if they ſtumble, it is but to break their ſhins
and to ſave their ſoules. But when the wicked ſtumble, they breake their

is a heavy judgement, and a ſigne of Gods indignation againſt men, a token
of his rejection of them, that he doth not intend good unto them. You bleſſe
your ſelves many times that in the way of ſinne you finde no difficulty; if a
whore-maſter, or a malicious man, who would accompliſh his owne ends,
find all things goe on as he deſires, ſo that he hath not any rub in his way, no

all, thou haſt cauſe to howle, and wring thy hands, for the curſe of God
is upon thee, a dreadfull curſe to make the way of ſinne pleaſant. On the

ſomewhat difficult to them, they are troubled at it, that they cannot have
their will. Troubled? thou haſt cauſe to bleſſe God who hath thus croſſed
thee, for it is an argument of much love to thee. There is a <hi>Behold</hi> put to

the way muſt be hedged up to keep men from it. It is not enough to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warn

men. How wicked then is the way of many amonſt us, who ſeeke to make
the way of Idolatry too ſmooth, and plain, and open as they can! yea in ſtead
of ſtopping ſuch as have inclinations to it, they lay before them the inciting

               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Obſer. 3.</note> Afflictions to the people of God, are Gods hedges to keep them
from ſinne. The command of God is one hedge, and affliction is another.
Therefore ſinne is called by the name of <hi>Tranſgreſſion,</hi> Tranſgreſſion, what
is that? That is, going beyond their bounds, going over the hedge; a man
that ſinneth goes over the hedge. And wee finde, <hi>Eccleſ. 10. 8. Hee that

of Gods command, he that will venture to break that hedge, muſt expect a
ſerpent to bite him, muſt expect the biting of Conſcience, the anguiſh and
horrour of that: But when that hedge is broke, God cometh with another
hedge to keep his people from ſinne, ſo you have it expreſt in <hi>Job</hi> 33. 17, 18.

but now the husbandman ſetteth a hedge there, and when the beaſt
commeth juſt to the hedge, to the thornes, then it is withdrawn from what
it was about, and ſo the life of it preſerved; ſo it may be with a man that
is running to ſuch a place, when hee meeteth with ſomething that hinders
him, he is drawn from his purpoſe, and his ſoul is kept back from death.</p>
               <p>You uſe to deale thus with your children, if you live in the Countrey neer

As afflictions keep the Saints from ſinne, as a hedge to them, ſo the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
in Gods wayes keepes the wicked from God. VVhen difficulties
therefore do fall out, it ſhould teach us to conſider what way we are in, why?
for God uſeth to compaſſe about ſinfull wayes, with difficulties, on purpoſe
to keep his people from them. Well, I am in a way going on in it, I am ſure
I am compaſt about with difficulties, it may be theſe difficulties are but Gods
hedges to keepe me from ſinne; how ſhall I know that? for ſometimes dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
are but tryals of our graces, and they may be ſuch as call for the ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
up of our graces to breake through the hedge, ſo <hi>Pro.</hi> 8. 19. difficulties
are ſaid to be <hi>a hedge of thornes;</hi> they lye in the wayes of Gods people that
are bleſſed wayes, then the worke of the Saints ſhould be to ſtirre up their
graces, and to breake thorough the hedge, though they be pricked, and
their fleſh torne, that is, their excellency, that they can breake thorough
thoſe difficulties, faith will carry through all difficulties in Gods wayes.</p>
               <p>Therefore here is the triall, when I meet with difficulties, I muſt not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare
becauſe there are difficulties, but I muſt examine, Is it the way of
God or not? If it be the way of God, then lay aſide the thought of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
if I have a rule for it let the difficulties be never ſo many, and the
hedge never ſo thicke, yet <hi>I</hi> muſt breake through, and God is ſo much the
more honoured by it: but on the otherſide, if upon examination <hi>I</hi> finde
the way <hi>I</hi> am in is not warrantable by God, then <hi>I</hi> muſt know that Gods
end in laying difficulties in the way, is to ſtop my going on in it, and it is
deſperateneſſe in me to ſeeke to breake thorow, in ſeeking to break thorow
<hi>I</hi> may break my neck, therefore <hi>I</hi> muſt look to it that <hi>I</hi> have warrant from
God for thoſe waies <hi>I</hi> am in.</p>
               <p>Oh that men would think of this when they meet with difficulties in their
wayes! I might ſhew how the Saints have many times met with difficulties
in their wayes, and yet have gone on with ſtrength; That of <hi>Jacob</hi> is one
of the moſt famous examples we have in the Book of God, the difficulties
he met withall, and that in the way that God himſelfe bad him go in. God
bade him returne to his Father <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and yet he met with ſixe or ſeven pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
difficulties, that one would have thought ſhould have made him
doubted whether he was in Gods way or not, and have cauſed him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
back againe. Firſt, <hi>Laban</hi> purſueth him, and intends miſchiefe
gainſt him; and <hi>Eſau</hi> he in that journey comes to meet him with a purpoſe
to deſtroy him,<note place="margin">If our way be Gods wee muſt breake through all difficulties</note> his wives nurſe dyed, and <hi>Rachell</hi> her ſelfe dyed in that jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
he had his daughter <hi>Diana</hi> defloured, his two ſonnes committed that
horrible wickedneſſe, in murthering the Sechemites: All theſe fell out in
<hi>Jacobs</hi> journey; he might have ſaid, Am I in the way that God would have
me? Yes, <hi>Jacob</hi> was in his way, hee had an expreſſe warrant from God to
goe that journey. Difficulties therefore muſt not diſcourage us, but we muſt
breake through them; eſpecially in theſe times. It were a low and poor ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
to be kept from a good way becauſe of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:42662:122"/>
If we know it be Gods way, goe through it in the name of God, let the
difficulties be what they will. But if they be not warrantable by God, let
the difficulties we meet withall ſtop us, for God intendeth them to be a
hedge to keepe us from ſin.</p>
               <p>Againe, it ſhould make us be content when any affliction befalls us; why,
becauſe it is more then we know that God intends abundance of good to us;
It may be, if this affliction had not befallen thee, thou hadſt undone thy ſelf:
If this affliction that thou doeſt ſor riggle to get out of, and thinkeſt thy ſelfe
ſo miſerable under it, if it had not befalne thee, thou mighteſt have faln into
the pit and beene loſt, therefore be not troubled ſo much at the affliction,
but examine whether it be not a hedge that God hath ſet, to keepe thee from
a further miſery. But it ſeemes that this will not ſerve, there muſt be a <hi>wall,</hi>
as well as this <hi>hedge.</hi> Hence the obſervation is this,</p>
               <p>The perverſneſſe of mans heart is ſuch,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> that he will breake through many
difficulties to get unto ſin.</p>
               <p>We reade of Idolaters, who would cauſe their children to paſſe through
the fire to their Idols, that was more then a hedge of thorns. We ſee it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
that mens hearts are ſo ſtrongly bent upon their ſins, that though it were
to paſſe through a great deale of trouble, though they prick and tare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
yet they will have their ſin.<note place="margin">Wicked men will ſuffer much for their luſts.</note> As that notable ſtory that <hi>Ambroſe</hi> tells
us of, of one <hi>Philotimus</hi> who brought his body to grievous diſeaſes, by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe
and drunkenneſſe, and the Phyſitians told him, that if he did not
abſtain he would certainly loſe his eyes, there was no help for him; as ſoone
as ever he heareth this, he anſwereth thus, <hi>Valeat lumen amicum.</hi> Farewell
O pleaſant light, rather then I will deny my ſelf in this, I will never ſee light
more; he would venture the loſſe of his eyes, rather then loſe the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his luſts. Thus it is with many, O what do they venture for their luſts!
What an argument ſhould that be to us to venture much for God, to indure
hard things for the bleſſed God: though there be ſome hardſhip between us
and our duty, breake through all to get to that duty; wicked men will break
through great difficulties to get to their ſins. There need be a wall as well as
a hedge. VVell, if there be need of a wall, I will have <hi>a wall,</hi> ſaith God,
<hi>I</hi> will wall up her way, though ſhe may make a ſhift to breake downe the

               <p>Hence the Obſervation is,</p>

<hi>God</hi> can ſtrike men with blindneſs one way or other, that they ſhall not bee

deſtruction, they can find every ſecret path of ſin, though ſin be a labyrinth,
they can goe up and down in it, finde out ever by-path in that way. When
the waies of God are propounded to wicked men, there is a miſt before their

there is no healing vertue in them, but an inraging quality to ſtir up ſinne, till
God ſanctifie them by his grace, &amp; God may ſuſpend for a time the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying

a net, in a raging manner. This diſtemper of heart proceeds from two
grounds.</p>
               <p>1. When outward comforts are taken away by affliction, the ſinner ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no comfort in God, he knows not where to have comfort but in his ſin,
if conſcience be not ſtrong enough to keep from it, he runs madly upon it.</p>
               <p>2. Becauſe he thinks that others looke upon him as one oppoſed by God
for his ſin, therefore that he may declare to all the world that he is not daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at all, nor that he hath no miſgiving thoughts, (though perhaps hee hath
nipping gripes within) yet he will put a good face upon it, and follow his
wayes more eagerly then formerly.</p>

any in the world that was diſappointed (if he knew all) in following Gods

was as good, if not better for him: but in the wayes of ſinne, in our owne
wayes we may meet with diſappointment; why ſhould we not then rather
follow God then follow our own deſires? The deſires after ſin, as they are
<hi>Deſideria futilia,</hi> ſo they are <hi>Deſideria inutilia,</hi> as one ſpeakes; as they are

what they greedily ſought after; Our adverſaries bleſſed themſelvs in

God hath done this in mercy to them, (as it is ſpoken of here) that we know

a luſt, you ſhall have it, you ſhall be ſatisfied to the full, and bleſſe your

but for the Saints, when they would have ſuch a way of ſin, God will diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
them, they ſhall not have it. We account it ordinarily very grievous
to be diſappointed of any thing, and many times I have had this meditation
upon it; What, doth it trouble the hearts of men to be diſappointed almoſt
in any thing? Oh what a dreadfull vexation and horror will it be for a man

returning to God.<note place="margin">Cum ne mi ni ob trvdi po teſt, itur da me.</note> Thus is God infinitely diſhonoured by us, It is very
ſtrange how the hearts of men will hanker after their ſinne this way, and that
way, till God take them quite off from hope of comfort by it, they will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have a thought to returne unto God; God is faine to be the laſt refuge,

               <p>But you will ſay, will ever God accept of ſuch a one? Marke the next ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation;
returning to God, if it be in truth, though it be thus after wee
have ſought out for all other helpes, yet God is willing to accept of it.</p>
               <p>This is an obſervation full of comfort, the Lord grant it may not be abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
but it is the word of the Lord, and it is a certaine truth, that returning
after men have ſought other meanes, and can finde no help, though they are
driven to it by afflictions, yet it may be accepted by God. It is true, man
will not accept upon theſe termes, but the thoughts of God are as ſarre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the thoughts of men as the heaven is above the earth. It is true indeed
ſome time God will not, nay God threatneth <hi>Pro.</hi> 1. 28. though they <hi>call

it: God ſome time at the very firſt affliction hardneth his heart againſt
men, that he will never regard them more, for his mercy is his owne; but
thoſe that are in covenant with him, though they come to him upon ſuch
termes, yet they may be accepted of him; therefore take this trueth for
helping of you againſt this fore temptation, when you are in affliction,
which will be apt to come in, Oh I cry to God now in my affliction, I
ſhould have done it before, ſurely God will not heare me now.</p>
               <p>This may be a temptation; I confeſſe I cannot ſpeake in this point with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a trembling heart leſt it be abuſed, but the Text preſents it fairely to

others abuſe it,<note place="margin">God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of us when we come to him in our af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fliction.</note> 
                  <hi>Pſal. 88. 9. Mine eye mourneth by reaſon of affliction,
Lord I have called daily upon thee:</hi> This is ſpoken of <hi>Heman,</hi> and God
did accept of him as it is apparrent in the Pſalm, yet he cryed by reaſon of
affliction; and <hi>Pſal. 120. 1. In my diſtreſſe I cryed unto the Lord and
he heard me;</hi> though it were in my diſtreſſe, yet the Lord heard me.</p>
               <p>Onely take this one note about it,</p>
               <p>It is true, Though our being ſtopped in all other wayes may make us
cry to God, and God may heare us, but when God doth hear us, he works
more then crying out by reaſon of that affliction; though at firſt our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
be the thing that carryeth ns unto God, yet before God hath done
withus, and manifeſt and any acceptance of us, hee workes our hearts to
higher aymes then deliverance from our affliction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Againe further,</hi> I will goe and returne.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="247" facs="tcp:42662:126"/>
A heart effectually wrought upon by God is a reſolute heart to returne to
God. As they were reſolute in their way of Idolatry, <hi>I will follow after
my lovers;</hi> ſo their hearts being converted, they ſhall be as reſolute in Gods
wayes, ſhe ſhall ſay, <hi>I will returne to my firſt husband.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When God will worke upon the heart to purpoſe, he cauſeth ſtrong argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to faſten upon the ſpirit, and nothing ſhal hinder it, no not father, nor
mother, nor the deareſt friend. Perhaps the Lord beginneth to worke upon
the child, and the father ſcornes him, and the mother perhaps ſaith, What
ſhall we have of you now? a Puritane? This grieveth the ſpirit of the child,
yet there are ſuch ſtrong arguments faſtned by God upon his heart, that it
carryeth him thorough, he is reſolute in his way, he will returne.</p>
               <p>Further, Thoſe who have ever found the ſweetneſſe of Chriſt in their
hearts, have yet ſomething remaining, that though they ſhould be apoſtates,
will at length draw them to him. Chriſt hath ſuch hold upon their hearts as
at one time or other he will get them in again, there will be ſome ſparkes
under thoſe embers that will flame and draw the ſoule to returne againe to
Chriſt. Therefore if any of you ever had any friends in whom you were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
perſwaded there was a true work of grace, though they be exceedingly
apoſtatized from Chriſt, do not give over your hope, for if ever there were
any true taſt of the ſweetneſſe that is in Chriſt, Chriſt hath ſuch a hold upon
their hearts, that he will bring them in again one time or other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Further,</hi> I will return to my firſt husband, for them was it better with me.</p>

of the Idolater, <hi>Iſay, 44. 20, A deceived heart hath turned him aſide, he

of Angels, the ſatisfaction of the Father himſelfe? Can a luſt put thee

the Church ſhould ſay, I confeſſe I have plaid the foole, I have done ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,

<hi>Ier. 3. 25. We lie downe in our ſhame, and our confuſion covereth us, for
wee have ſinned againſt the Lord our God,</hi> ſaith the Church there; ſo it
ſhould be with all that come in to return to Chriſt, they muſt lie downe in
their ſhame.</p>
               <p>This I note as very ſeaſonable in theſe times, we have many now who not
long ſince have been very vile apoſtates, they have gone with the times, they
ſaw preferment went ſuch a way, and their hearts went that way; Now
they ſee they cannot have preferment in that way they went, and God of
his mercy hath changed the times, they will bee Converts: Wee have in
England many parliamentary Converts, but ſuch as wee are not to confide

God accepteth them, and why ſhould not we? It is true, ſuch an one was

               <p>To that I anſwer,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> It is true, if deep humiliation have gone before that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
if together with their being better they have been willing to

Lord knows I had a baſe time-ſerving heart, I went away from God, they
were no arguments that ſatisfied my conſcience, but meerly livings and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment,
and now I doe deſire to take ſhame and confuſion of face to my

mercy of God ever to regard ſuch a wretch as I. If they do thus take ſhame
to themſelves, and acknowledg their folly, this were ſomething. We read
in the Primitive times of one <hi>Ecebolius,</hi> who when he had revolted from the

cryeth out, <hi>Calcate, Calcate inſipidum ſalem,</hi> tread upon me unſavory

               <p>I will give but a little glimpſe of what might be ſaid in this point more
largely.</p>
               <p>The reaſonings of the heart in the ſight of this may briefely bee hinted
thus:</p>
               <p>Heretofore I was able through Gods mercy to look upon the face of God
with joy.<note place="margin">The reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of heart in a repenting Apoſtate.</note> When my heart did cleave to him, when I did walke cloſe with
God, then the glory of God ſhined upon mee, and cauſed my heart to
ſpring within me every time I thought of him: But now, now, God knows,
though the world takes little notice of it, the very thoughts of God are a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
to mee, the moſt terrible object in the world is to behold the face of
God. <hi>Oh it was better with me then it is now.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before this my apoſtaſie I had free acceſſe to the Throne of Gods grace, I
could come with humble and holy boldneſſe unto God, and poure out my
ſoule before him, ſuch a chamber, ſuch a cloſet can witneſſe it: But now I
have no heart to pray, yea I muſt be haled to it, meerely conſcience pulleth
me to it; yea every time I goe by that very cloſet where I was wont to have
that acceſſe to the throne of grace, it ſtrikes a terrour to my heart; I can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
come into Gods preſence but it is out of ſlaviſh feare. Oh, <hi>it was better
with me then, then it is now.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before, Oh the ſweet communion my ſoule enjoyed with Jeſus Chriſt!
one dayes communion with him, how much better was it then the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all the world! But now Jeſus Chriſt is a ſtranger to mee, and I a

               <p>
                  <pb n="251" facs="tcp:42662:127"/>
Before, oh thoſe ſweet enlargements that my ſoule had in the ordinances
of God! when I came to the word, my ſoule was refreſhed, was warmed,
my heart was inlightned; when I came to the Sacrament, oh the ſweetneſs
that was there! and to prayer with the people of God, it was even a <hi>heaven

dead and empty things to me. Oh <hi>it was better with mee then, then it is

               <p>Before, oh the gracious viſitations of Gods Spirit that I was wont to
have! Yea, when I awaked in the night ſeaſon, oh the glimpſes of Gods face
that were upon my ſoule! what quicknings, and refreſhings, and inlivenings
did I finde in them! I would give a world for one nights comfort I ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

ſaid, though they rayled and accuſed, yet my conſcience ſpake peace to me,
and was a thouſand witneſſes for me: but now I have a grating conſcience
within me, oh the black boſome that is in me, it flieth in my face every day,
after I come from ſuch and ſuch company; I could come before from
the ſociety of the Saints, and my conſcience ſmiled upon me: Now I go to

I am as one bereft of all, unfit for any thing, even as a dead logg. Before
God made uſe of me and imployed me in honorable ſervices, now I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit

I could looke up to all thoſe bleſſed, ſweet promiſes that God had made in

are very little to me: before I could look upon the face of all troubles,
and the face of death, I could look upon them with joy, but now the thought
of affliction and of death, God knows how terrible they are to me. <hi>It was

how much better it was with you before then now; how much
better was it when I lived in ſuch a family, under ſuch a Maſter, in ſuch a
Towne, Oh it was better then with me then it is now! Oh the precious days
that once I had when I was a young one, thoſe dayes are gone, and wheth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ever they will come again, God knows.</p>
               <p>Yet further, when the judgement paſſeth on Gods ſide, that it was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
before then now, then the ſoul is in a hopefull way. So long as the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
holdeth for God and his wayes, though thou beeſt an Apoſtate,
though perhaps thy heart be drawn aſide from God, and thy affections be
unruly, thou art not in a deſperate condition, there is hope of thee. There
are two ſorts of Apoſtates. There are ſome Apoſtates, who though they
are ſo through the unrulineſſe of their affections, and the ſtrength of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
yet they keep their judgements for Gods wayes, and acknowledge
Gods people to be beſt, and his Ordinances to be beſt, and themſelves in the
danger. But now there are ſome Apoſtates, who do ſo fall off from God
and his wayes, that they begin in their very judgements to thinke that thoſe
wayes they profeſt before were but fancies, and that the people of God are
but a company of humerous people, and bleſſe themſelves in their owne
wayes, and think that they are better now then they were before: oh this is
a hideous thing. If thy judgement be once taken, that thou thinkeſt the
wayes of ſinn to be better then thoſe wayes of God that before thou profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedſt,
then Lord have mercy upon thee, thou art a gone man, wee doe not
know that God will doe with thee, but in the judgement of man thou art
even a gone man.</p>
               <p>I remember <hi>Latimer</hi> in a Sermon before King <hi>Edward</hi> hath this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage.
I have known (ſaith he) many Apoſtates, but I never knew any more
then one that proved a ſcorner, and yet returned again. Take heed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
ſaith he, of apoſtaſie. Though a man may fall off from God, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
return; but yet if he fall off, ſo that his judgement is taken that he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a ſcorner, that is a wofull condition, ſuch a one ſcarce ever returneth.
Many ſuch Apoſtates you have in <hi>England,</hi> &amp; I would challenge you all to
give me one example of any one that ever returned again that ſo fell. I know
many ſcorners are converted, but they that have beene forward in profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
and then fall off, and prove ſcorners, where have you any of them
come in?</p>
               <p>You have a notable place for this, <hi>Levit.</hi> 13. 44. there you ſhall finde
when the Prieſt ſhall come and ſee a man that hath got the <hi>leproſie in his
head,</hi> the Prieſt ſhall pronounce him <hi>utterly uncleane,</hi> for <hi>the plague</hi>
                  <pb n="254" facs="tcp:42662:129"/>
ſaith the Text, <hi>is in the head.</hi> You ſhall obſerve in all the Chapter, when
the Prieſt found uncleanneſſe in any other thing, he was to pronounce it <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean,</hi>
but if the leproſie be in the head, he ſhall pronounce the party <hi>ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
uncleane,</hi> for <hi>the plague is in the head,</hi> there is not that utter unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
any where as when the plague is in the head, So I may ſay here, when
a man falleth off from the wayes of God by ſome ſtrong temptation or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly
affection, this man is uncleane, verily he is uncleane; but when it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to the head, that his judgement is againſt the wayes of God, and ſo
commeth to contemne them and thoſe that follow them, and to thinke his
own wayes better, this man is utterly unclean, for the plague is in his head,
The Lord deliver you from that plague.</p>

preſent occaſion to digreſſe a little in the comparing our preſent times
with former times, to examine whether wee can ſay, it was better with us
heretofore then it is now? In theſe dayes there is much comparing our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
times with times paſt, and divers judgements there are about preſent
times, ſome complayning and crying out of the hazards and dangers wee
are in, in theſe preſent times, much better was it heretofore ſay they then it
is now. To ſuch as theſe let me ſay, firſt as the holy Ghoſt ſaith, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.
10. <hi>Say not thou, what is the cauſe the former dayes were better then theſe?
thou doſt uot enquire wiſely concerning this thing.</hi> Certainly, thoſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
who make ſuch grievous complaints of preſent times, comparing them
with times paſt, doe not wiſely enquire after this thing. It is true, there are
many ſad things for the preſent amongſt us, things that our hearts have cauſe
to bleed for, ſuch miſ-underſtanding betweene King and Parliament, ſome
blood ſhed already, and danger of ſhedding much more; yet perhaps if we
enquire wiſely concerning this thing, we ſhall find, that notwithſtanding all
this, we have little cauſe to complaine that it is worſe with us now, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
of what was before, Conſider, firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that which men do moſt complain
of, which makes the times hardeſt now, it is but the breaking out of thoſe
miſchievous deſignes that lay hid long before,<note place="margin">Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times before were better then they are now.</note> &amp; would have done us a great
deale more miſchiefe if they had been kept in; Now they breake forth, and
breake forth as the deſperateneſſe of the hopes of thoſe who had ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes;
becauſe they could now goe no longer underhand, but being
brought into a deſperate paſſe, they are faine to ſee what they can doe
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:42662:130"/>
in wayes of violence, and this certainely is better then that miſchiefe ſhould
work ſecretly under board.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, by this we have a diſcovery of men which way they ſtand, what
was and is in their hearts, and this is a great mercy.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, with the breaking forth of theſe things, God grants that helpe
now to England, that it never yet had in the like way, ſo fully, and putteth
ſuch a faire price into the hands of the people of <hi>England,</hi> that never yet was
put into their hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Yea, and conſider farther, that the more violent men are now, the more doth
it tell us what a lamentable time was before; for if now when there is ſuch
means of reſiſtance, and yet the adverſaries prevaile ſo much, what would
they have been by this time, if this means of reſiſtance had not been? What
a caſe were we in then when they might do what they would, and we had no
means to help our ſelves, what a danger were we in then? Certainely things
then lay at more hazard then now.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, though there be many ſad things amongſt us, yet God hath been
before-hand with us, we have had already even of free-coſt as much mercy
as theſe troubles come to.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixtly, theſe troubles that we are in are making way for glorious mercies
to come; though there be ſome pangs, yet they are not the pangs of death,
they are but the pangs of a travelling woman that is bringing forth a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child:
And certainly any Prince would think, that though his Queen ſhould
be put to ſome paine in travaile, yet her condition is better then when ſhee
had nopaine, and was barren, or then that ſhe ſhould lye upon her ſick bed,
and her ſenſes benummed, and ſhe ready to dye: The pains of a travelling
woman are better then a ſenſleſs dying.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> And yet further, if you thinke that you had better times heretofore then
now, what times will you refer your ſelves unto in making the compariſon?
I ſuppoſe you will inſtance in the time of the firſt Reformation, then things
were in a good way, when thoſe worthy Lights of the Church, and bleſſed
Martyrs had ſuch a hand in the Reformation. Many there are that do mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>nes of the beginning of Reformation,<note place="margin">The weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the argument taken from the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and practiſes of learned &amp; godly men.</note> for their owne ends, that
they may thereby hinder Reformation now. This you know is the great
argument that prevaileth with moſt; What, were not thoſe Prayers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
by learned godly men, as <hi>Cranmer, Latimer, Ridley,</hi> and others?
and can we be wiſer then they? did not they ſeale their profeſſion with their
blood?</p>
               <p>My brethren, we need goe no further to ſhew the weakneſſe of this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but only to ſhew how it was in the Church in thoſe times, and you
wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> find that you have cauſe to bleſſe God that it is not ſo with you now as
it was then, and if that will appeare, then the argument you will ſee can no
further prevail with rationall men.</p>
               <p>Certainly thoſe firſt Reformers were worthy Lights and bleſſed inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for God, I would not darken their excellency, but weaken the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:42662:130"/>
that is abuſively raiſed from their worth. It is reported of Mr. <hi>Grene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
that famous practicall Divine, who refuſing ſubſcription, in a Letter
of his to the Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> gives his reaſons, and anſwers that Prelates obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
againſt him, namely, that <hi>Luther</hi> thought ſuch Ceremonies might be
retained in the Church; his Anſwer is this, <hi>I</hi> reverence more the revealed
wiſdome of God, in teaching Mr. <hi>Luther</hi> ſo many neceſſary things to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
then <hi>I</hi> ſearch his ſeeret judgements in keeping back from his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
other things of leſſe importance: The ſame do I ſay of thoſe worthy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
of Gods glory in the firſt Reformation, &amp; that it may be cleare to
you that God kept back his mind from them in ſome things. Conſider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you would be willing that ſhould be done now that was then; As in the
adminiſtration of baptiſme, we find that in the book of Lyturgy in King
<hi>Edwards</hi> time, which was compoſed by thoſe worthy men; firſt the child
was to be croft in the fore-head, and then on the breaſt, after a prayer uſed, then
the Prieſt was to ſay over the child at the Font, <hi>I command thee thou un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean
ſpirit, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghoſt,
that thou comeſt out of this infant, thou curſed ſpirit remember thy ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
remember thy judgment, remember the day is at hand wherein thou
ſhalt bee burnt with everlaſting fire prepared for thee and thy Angels; &amp;
preſume not hereafter to exerciſe any tyranny over this infant whom Chriſt
hath bought with his precious blood.</hi> Then they dipped the childe thrice in
the water, the Godfathers and the Godmothers laid their hands upon the
child, and the Prieſt putteth a white veſtment over it, called a Cryſome,
ſaying, <hi>Take this white veſture for a token of thine innocency, which by
Gods grace in this holy Sacrament of baptiſme is given to thee, &amp; for a
ſigne whereby thou art admoniſhed as long as thou liveſt to give thy ſelfe to
innocency.</hi> Then the Prieſt muſt anoint the Infant upon the head, ſaying,
<hi>Almighty God, &amp;c. who hath regenerated thee by water &amp; the holy Ghoſt,
who hath given thee remiſſion of all thy ſins, vouchſafe to anoint thee with
the unction of his holy Spirit.</hi> Would you now have your children bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
after this manner? yet theſe learned holy men thought that to
be a good way. So at the buriall of the dead, the Prieſt caſting earth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the corps ſhall ſay, <hi>I commend thy ſoule to God the Father Almighty,
and body to the ground:</hi> and in another prayer, <hi>Grant to this thy ſervant;
that the ſinnes he committed in this world be not imputed to him, but that
he eſcaping the gates of hell, and pains of eternall darkneſſe, may ever dwell
in the region of light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You will ſay, things are otherwiſe now. True, therefore I ſay there is no
ſtrength in that argument, that thoſe men that compoſed that liturgy were
worthy lights in the Church; for they were but newly come out of Popery,
and had the ſcent of Popery upon them, therefore it is too unreaſonable to
make that which they did the rule of our Reformation now, as if we were to
goe no further then they did.</p>
               <p>The like may be ſaid of the Primitive times, which many plead for the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:42662:131"/>
juſtification of their ſuperſtitious vanities, for the Chriſtians then came but
newly out of heatheniſme, and lived amongſt Heathens, and therfore could
not ſo ſoon be delivered from their heatheniſh cuſtomes. I could relate to
you ſad things there were in Qu. <hi>Elizabeths</hi> dayes, in K. <hi>James</hi> his dayes,
but <hi>I</hi> muſt not take too much liberty in this digresſion, onely let us hereby
learn not ſo to cry out of evill times that we are faln into, as to be unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for preſent mercies; let us bleſſe God for what wee have had, and looke
unto the rule for further reformation.</p>

We ſhall ſee afterward of what great uſe this is unto us, to ſhew what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
they made of acknowledging that God gave them all, and yet God
charges them that they did not know it.</p>
               <p>That I gave them, <hi>what?</hi> Corne, wine, and oyle, &amp; multiplyed her
ſilver and her gold.</p>
               <p>Here God expreſſeth himſelfe more largely then they did before in that
they received from their Idols, they talked in the 5. <hi>verſ.</hi> of receiving from
their Idols <hi>bread, and water, and wool, and flax, &amp;c.</hi> but here is <hi>wine, &amp;
oyle, and ſilver, and gold,</hi> more then they had from their Idols. God ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
out his mercy to them, to upbraid them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And</hi> they prepared them for Baal.</p>
               <p>We muſt enquire here firſt what this <hi>Baal</hi> was. The name of him [<hi>Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi>]
it ſignifieth <hi>a Lord</hi> (and from thence ſignifyeth <hi>a husband</hi>) becauſe
they attributed ſuch dominion that their Idols had over them,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </note> acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Idols to be Lords,<note place="margin">What <hi>Baal</hi> was.</note> therefore they called them by the name <hi>Bagnall,</hi>
their Lords: And becauſe they choſe them as their husband, therefore alſo
they had this name, it is all one with <hi>Bel</hi> too, for the Chaldee put out that
letter [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] and the pricks being altered it is all one <hi>Baal</hi> and <hi>Bel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this <hi>Baal</hi> either was ſome ſpeciall Idoll, or elſe a generall name gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to all Idols; ſometimes it is a name given generally to all, in the plurall
number <hi>Baalim. Jer. 9. 14. They have walked after the imaginations of
their owne heart, and after Baalim.</hi> But it likewiſe notes a ſpeciall Idol,
an Idol that was the ſame with that of the Zidonians, which they called <hi>Iupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Thalaſſius,</hi> or their <hi>ſea Iupiter,</hi> that idol was called <hi>Baal</hi> in a ſpeciall
manner,</p>
               <p>1 <hi>King.</hi> 16. 31. you may ſee how the worſhip of <hi>Baal</hi> came into Iſrael
at that time. It is true, the worſhip of <hi>Baal</hi> had been in <hi>Iſrael</hi> a long time
before, in <hi>Iudg.</hi> 2. 11. you ſhall find there that <hi>they ſerved Baal,</hi> yet the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry
of <hi>Baal</hi> was often caſt out by the people of God, but in that place of
the Kings you ſhall find how it came in afreſh, the Text ſaith, that <hi>Ahab
tooke to wife Iexebel the daughter of Eth-baal King of the Zidonians, &amp;
went and ſerved Baal, and worſhipped him;</hi> That was the occaſion that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab</hi>
matching with a Zidonian, to the end that he might ingratiate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
with his wives kindred, he would worſhip his wives God.</p>
               <p>And this <hi>Baal</hi> hath divers additionall names. Sometimes you ſhall find
in Scripture called <hi>Baal-zebub,</hi> or <hi>Belzebub</hi> (it is all one, for <hi>Baal</hi> and <hi>Bel</hi>
is the ſame, only changing the points) and that ſignifieth their <hi>god of flies,</hi> &amp;
the reaſon why <hi>Baal</hi> had that name, was, becauſe in thoſe Countreyes they
were extreamly perplexed with flies, and they attributed the power of dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them away, and of helping them againſt the moleſtation they had by
them to their god <hi>Baal,</hi> hence they called him <hi>Baalzebub;</hi> you may ſee how
much they attributed to their god for deliverance from flies, wee have other
manner of deliverances by the goodnes of our God then this, yet for this <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alzebub</hi>
was one of their principall gods, therefore it is ſaid of Chriſt, that
<hi>he caſt out devils by Belzebub the prince of devills,</hi> which is <hi>by the god of
flies,</hi> Mat. 20. 25.</p>

                  </note> to make God to be the God of our Covenant,
as their god here was. It is needleſſe to name more who had this name.</p>
               <p>I ſhall afterward ſhew how God himſelfe had once the name of <hi>Baal,</hi> for
the word ſignifying the name of <hi>husband</hi> or <hi>Lord</hi> was as due to God as to
any other, and God himſelfe tooke that name. But here we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it of their Idols.</p>
               <p>They <hi>prepared them for Baal,</hi> they <hi>made</hi> them for <hi>Baal,</hi> ſo the word is.
It importeth theſe two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt it importeth that they did ſacrifice theſe thing to their <hi>Baal,</hi> for ſo <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,
to make,</hi> is as much many times as <hi>Sacrificare, to ſacrifice;</hi> And <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la
mine</hi> takes advantage from this word, when Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Hoc facite, do
this,</hi> he draweth an argument that the Lords Supper is a ſacrifice, for the
word to <hi>doe</hi> is uſed ſomtime to <hi>ſacrifice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſecondly, <hi>they prepared them,</hi> that is, of their gold and ſilver they
made Images of this their Idoll god <hi>Baal,</hi> they would not ſpare their gold
and ſilver, but laid aſide and prepared it to make images of <hi>Baal,</hi> and they
thought that gold and ſilver thus laid out as good as any in their purſes.</p>
               <p>The Obſervations.</p>
               <p>Firſt.</p>
               <p>It is God that ſupplyeth all the outward good of his people.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They did not know that I gave them, &amp;c.</hi> I gave them all the corn, and
wine, and oyle they had, I did not onely give them mine Ordinances, but
I gave them corn, and wine, and oyle, and gold, and ſilver.</p>
               <p>It is the Lord himſelfe that ſupplyeth all outward good to his people, he
doth not onely prize the ſoules of his people, but hee takes care of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
too, and outward eſtates. <hi>Pſalm, 34. 20. He keepeth all his bones.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, he takes care of the very <hi>haire</hi> of <hi>their heads.</hi> The bodies of the
Saints are very precious in the eyes of God, the moſt precious of all corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
things in the world: The Sonne, and Moone, and Starres, are not
ſo precious as the bodyes of the Saints, how much more precious are their
ſoules?</p>
               <p>VVe have an excellent note of <hi>Auſtin</hi> upon <hi>Pſalm,</hi> 63. 1. where the
Text ſaith, <hi>My ſoule thirſteth for thee, my fleſh longeth for thee, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon this he hath this Note: If the fleſh hath any need of bread, of wine,
of money or cattell, ſeeke this of God, for God giveth this too, for marke,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="261" facs="tcp:42662:132"/>
Thoſe who thirſt for God muſt thirſt for him every way; not only their
<hi>ſoules</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>rſt for him, but their <hi>fleſh</hi> muſt thirſt for him; for ſaith he, did
God make the ſoul, and did the devills or any idols make the fleſh? No,
he that made both ſoule and fleſh, he feedeth them both, therefore all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
muſt ſay, <hi>My ſoule longeth after thee,</hi> and <hi>my fleſh</hi> alſo. If then we
can truſt God for our <hi>ſoules,</hi> and our eternall eſtates that hee will provide
for them, we muſt truſt him for our bodies alſo, for our <hi>fleſh,</hi> for our tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
eſtates, that he will provide for them alſo.</p>
               <p>Secondly thus.
All that we have,<note place="margin">Obj.</note> all our ſupply that we enjoy in this world, it is
the free gift of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They did not know that I gave them corne and wine, &amp;c.</hi> All of us live
upon the meere Almes of God, the greateſt man in the world is bound to
goe to Gods gate and beg his bread every day; though he were an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
over all the world,<note place="margin">The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt man in the world muſt beg his bread at Gods gate every day.</note> hee muſt doe it to ſhew his dependance upon him,
that he lives wholly upon almes: Men thinke it hard to live upon almes, and
becauſe they have maintenance, ſo much comming in by the yeare, ſuch an
eſtate in land, they thinke they are well provided for many yeers: But what
ever eſtate thou haſt, though by thy trading thou haſt gotten ſo much by the
yeare coming in, yet God requireth this of thee, to go to his gate, &amp; beg thy
bread of him every day; ſo Chriſt teacheth, <hi>Give us this day our dayly
bread;</hi> And certainly if we did but underſtand this our dependance upon
God for all outward comforts in the world, we could not but feare him, and
ſeeke to make peace with him, and keepe peace with him, and it would be
a meanes that our hearts would be inlarged to give to others who need our
almes, and ſeeing every man and woman of us is an Almes-man, and an
Almes-woman.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,
It is our duty that we owe to God to know and take notice of God as
the author of all our good.<note place="margin">Obſ.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They know not,</hi> that implyeth they ought to have knowne.</p>
               <p>This is a ſpeciall duty of that worſhip we owe to God: it is the end of
Gods communicating all good to us, that he may have active glory from his
rational creature as well as paſſive glory, and there is no creature elſe in all
the world that God hath made capable of knowing any thing of the firſt
cauſe but only the rational creature, therefore it is the excellency of ſuch that
they do not onely enjoy the good that they have, but they are able to riſe up
to the higheſt and firſt cauſe of all their good: There is a great deale of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
in this. It is obſerved of Doves, that at every pick of corne they
take in their bill they caſt their eyes upward; and in the Canticles you ſhall
finde the eyes of the Church are called <hi>Doves eyes,</hi> becauſe they looke ſo
much up to heaven upon every good they receive: They have not dogs eies,
the men of the world have dogs eies, dogs you know looke up to their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
for a bone, and when they have it they preſently looke downe to the
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:42662:133"/>
ground; ſo the men of the world, they will pray to God when they want,
but wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n they enjoy what they would have, they look no more upward but
all downward.</p>
               <p>This taking notice of God to be the Author of all our good, and to give
him praiſe, is all the rent we pay to God for what we enjoy, therefore it is
fit we ſhould doe that; and if we doe any thing for God, be ſure God takes
notice of that to the uttermoſt, yea though it be himſelfe that enableth us to
do it, yea though it be but a little good mingled with a great deale of evill,
God takes notice of it, and will reward it, ſurely then we ſhould take notice
of the good that he giveth out to us.</p>
               <p>This ſweetneth our comforts to ſee that they all come from God, and for
that obſerve the difference betweene the expreſſion of <hi>Jacobs</hi> bleſſing, and
<hi>Eſaus</hi> blesſing;<note place="margin">The ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſse of a comfort is, that it comes from God.</note> when <hi>Iſaac</hi> came to bleſſe <hi>Jacob,</hi> hee expreſſeth himſelfe
thus, <hi>Gen. 27. 28. God give thee of the dew of heaven, and of the fatneſſe of
the earth, and plenty of corne and wine, &amp;c.</hi> Now when he commeth to
bleſſe <hi>Eſau,</hi> marke his expresſion then verſe 39. <hi>Thy dwelling ſhall be the
fatneſſe of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above,</hi> but hee never
mentioneth God in that; It is not <hi>Eſaus</hi> blesſing. <hi>God give thee of the dew
of heaven, and of the fatneſſe of the earth,</hi> though it is true <hi>Iſaac</hi> meant ſo,
but yet he doth not mention the name of <hi>God</hi> ſo in <hi>Eſaus</hi> as in <hi>Iacobs</hi> bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
Certainly my brethren, the ſeed of <hi>Jacob</hi> count their blesſing to be a
double, a treble blesſing, that they can ſee God in it: carnall hearts do not
much regard God, if they can have what they would have, if they can have
their fleſh ſatisfied in what they deſire, from what hand it cometh that they
doe not much care; but a gracious heart, a child of <hi>Jacob,</hi> rejoyceth more
in the hand from whence it commeth, then in any good he can posſibly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy.
Fourthly, <hi>They did not know.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God doth a great deale of good in the world that is little taken notice of,<note place="margin">Obſ.</note>
or laid to heart.</p>
               <p>Many of Gods diſpenſations are inviſible, the Angels, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1. are deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
with <hi>their hands under their wings.</hi> God doth great things ſomtime
ſo inviſibly, as he cannot be ſeene; And when he doth great things that we
might ſee, yet through onr neglect, ſtupidity, and drosſineſſe of our hearts,
we doe not ſee them.</p>
               <p>The moſt obſerving eye that is in the world, that takes the exacteſt notice
of Gods mercy, and hath the greateſt skill to ſet forth the riches of Gods
goodneſſe to himſelfe and others, yet alas it is but very little that he takes
notice of, no not of that he might doe. It is with the quickeſt ſighted Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
as with a skilful Mathematician, a skilfull Mathematician takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of and underſtands many parts of the world, and is able to ſet out the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
parts diſtinctly to you in ſuch a Climate, in ſuch a Countrey, but yet
when he hath done all, he leaveth a great ſpace for a <hi>Terra incognita,</hi> for an
unknown world, and that unknowne world for ought we know may be five
times bigger then the known world; So they that have the moſt obſervant
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:42662:133"/>
eye of Gods mercies, and take the moſt notice of them, that can beſt ſet
out the mercies he beſtoweth,<note place="margin">Many and great are Gods un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known mercies.</note> ſpiritual mercies, temporall mercies, preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
mercies, paſt mercies, preſent mercies, delivering mercies, &amp;c. yet when
they have done all, they muſt leave a great ſpace for the <hi>Terra incognita,</hi> for
the unknowne mercies of God.</p>
               <p>The truth is, thoſe mercies of God that are obvious to our knowledge e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
day, one would thinke they were enough to melt our hearts, to breake
them in pieces: but beſides theſe mercies we take notice of, there are thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
and thouſands of mercies that we know not of. As we daily commit
many ſins that we know not of,<note place="margin">Scire tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um nihil eſt, niſi te ſcire hoc ſciat alter.</note> ſo daily we receive many mercies that we
know not of likewiſe; And as in our confesſion of ſins, we ſhould pray to
God firſt to pardon our ſins we know, and ſo to name them in particular;
and when we have done, then, Lord forgive us our unknown, our ſecret ſins;
So in our thankſgiving, firſt bleſſe God for the mercies before us, and when
we have done. Lord bleſſed be thy name for all thy unknown mercies that
I have little taken notice of.</p>
               <p>We ſoone grow cold and dead if we doe good; and men take no notice
of us, neither what we know, nor what we doe is any thing to us except o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
know it too, but this is the vanity and pride of mens hearts, it is Gods
prerogative above his creatures, to doe all for himſelfe, for his owne glory,
and yet he doth much good in the world that none knows of; we are bound
to deny our ſelves in that we doe, not to ſeeke our own glory; The moſt
excellent peece in the moſt excellent of our workes is our ſelfe-denyal in it;
why ſhould we not then doe all the good we can doe cheerefully, though it
be not known? we ſhould doe good out of love to goodneſſe it ſelfe, and if
we would doe ſo we ſhould be encouraged in doing good ſecretly.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, and which commeth yet more fully up to the words, <hi>They did
not know, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In Gods account men know no more then they lay to heart and make
good uſe of.<note place="margin">Obſer.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The Schooles diſtinguiſh of want of knowledge, there is <hi>Neſcientia,</hi> and
<hi>Ignoratia; Neſcience</hi> is of ſuch things as we are not bound to know,<note place="margin">We know no more then we lay to heart.</note> it is
not our ſinne not to know them; but <hi>Ignorance</hi> is of ſuch things as we are
bound to know, and that ignorance is two-fold; there is an <hi>invincible</hi> ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
let us take what paines we can, wee can never know all we are
bound to know; and there is an <hi>affected</hi> ignorance, when we do not know,
becauſe out of careleſneſſe we doe not minde what is before us, and when
we have minded it ſo farre as to conceive it, yet if we lay it not to heart as
we ought, ſtill in Gods account we know it not, if we digeſt not what we
know into practiſe, God accepteth it not. As God is ſaid not to know
when hee doth not approve, <hi>I know yee not,</hi> ſaith he, ſo when any
man hath a truth in notion and it doth not get into the heart, when it is
not imbraced there, God accounts that that man knowes it not; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

theſe deductions are eaſie and obvious to any from ſuch a principle.</p>

               <p>Fifthly, The taking away thoſe good things we enjoy, is a meanes of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

of ſinne, when God comes with ſome ſpeciall worke of his againſt us, it
workes more upon us when we ſee ſome reall expreſſion of Gods diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
when God takes his mercies from us then when we heare the threat,
now wee come to be ſenſible of our ſinnes. You that are tradeſmen and
runne into debt, and your Creditors tell you they will come upon you, yet
you goe on, till the Bailife comes into your ſhop and ſeizeth upon all, and
goes into your houſe and takes away your bed from under you, and all your
goods; when you ſee all goe out, then you thinke of your negligence, and
then the husband and wife wring their hands. So though God threaten
you for the abuſe of the creature that hee will take it away, yet you are not
ſenſible of it till God indeed takes away all, and then conſcience begins to
be awakened and fly in your faces.</p>
               <p>VVhen <hi>David</hi> ſaw God taking away his people, then <hi>his heart ſmote
him</hi> for numbring them; hee was told of the evill of that way of his before
by <hi>Ioab,</hi> but he goes on in it. VVhen <hi>Samuel</hi> prayed for raine in wheat
harveſt, and there came thundring and lightning, then <hi>the people feared ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly,</hi>
and acknowledged their ſin in asking a King. Thoſe who have
abuſed their eſtates in theſe times, when the enemy comes, what gratings
of conſcience will they have? Then theſe thoughts will ariſe, Have I uſed

                  <hi>Againe,</hi> I will take away your corne in the time thereof, and your wine
in the ſeaſon thereof. <hi>This preſents this truth to you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That there is an uncertainty in all things in the world; Though they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
faire, yet they are ready to faile us, when they promiſe moſt. A huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman
that hath a good ſeed time, promiſeth much to himſelfe, it comes
up and thrives, and yet at harveſt it is all blaſted. <hi>Habak. 3. 17. Though
the labour of the olive faile,</hi> The phraſe is, <hi>Though the Labour of the olive
lye,</hi> that is, the olive promiſed faire, it grew up, and looked very faire, and
ripened, but it did <hi>lye,</hi> that is, it did not performe what it ſeemed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
for in the time thereof it vaniſhed and came to naught. I had certain
information from a reverend Miniſter, of a ſtrange work of God this way;
The thing was, in his owne Towne there was a worldling who had a great
crop of corne; a good honeſt neighbour of his walking by his corne, ſaith
he, Neighbour you have a very fine crop of corne, if God bleſſe it: Yea,
ſaith he, I will have a good crop, ſpeaking contemptuouſly and before he
could come to get it into the barne, it was blaſted, that the corn of the whole
crop was not worth ſix pence. Here we ſee the uncertainty of the creature
in the time thereof, when it ſeemes to promiſe never ſo faire, when wee are
ready to take it into the barne, it depends on God, as well as when it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the clods. Oh the bleſſedneſſe of Gods ſervants, who are ſure of their
good for time to come! We may promiſe our ſelves certainty, even for the
future in the things of Chriſt; but for outwards they are never ſure, no not
when men have them in their hands. <hi>Many things fall out betweene the
cup and lip,</hi> as we have it in the proverb.</p>
               <p>I will take away my corne in the time thereof, and wine in the ſeaſon
thereof. <hi>Hence Obſerve.</hi>
               </p>

he will not onely take them away in the time thereof, but when the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſhall be moſt grievous to them.</p>
               <p>That in the 20. of <hi>Job, ver.</hi> 22. is a moſt notable Scripture for this,
<hi>In the fulneſſe of his ſufficiency he ſhall be in ſtraits.</hi> A man may ſeeme to

God ſaith he ſhall be <hi>in ſtraits</hi> in the fulneſſe of his ſufficiency, I can give
you another admirable work of providence in this very things wherein you
may ſee God to come in ſore affliction at ſuch a time, when it is moſt bitter:
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:42662:139"/>
it came from that worthy Divine Doctor <hi>Preſton,</hi> it was in the Towne
where he was born; There was a man who of long time had no childe, but
when God gave him one,<note place="margin">wrath from God when wi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ked men leaſt think of it.</note> at the weaning of it hee called his friends and
neighbours to rejoyce with him for this great mercy: and the Nurſe going
to dandle the child in her arme, and wearing a knife in her boſom, the point
of the knife being upward, while ſhe was dandling of the child, runs into the
belly of the child, at that time when all his friends were about him to rejoyce
with him. When men thinke <hi>the bitterneſſe of death to be paſt,</hi> (as <hi>Agag</hi>
did) the curſe of God comes on them. <hi>Pſ. 78. 30. While the meate was in
their mouths, the wrath of God fell upon them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have read of Pope <hi>John</hi> the 22. that he ſaid he knew by the poſition of

reported of a drunken fellow in an Inne was ſwearing moſt dreadfully, and
one comes in and ſaith, Sir, what if you should dye now? ſaith hee, I shall
never eye, and going down the ſtairs when he went out of his chamber, he
preſently feldown and broke his neck.</p>
               <p>There is likewiſe a hiſtory of one <hi>Bibulus</hi> a Roman, that riding in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph

brains. As on the contrary, Gods wayes and dealings with the Saints are
ſuch, as what time their condition is moſt ſad, God comes in with mercy to
them, when they are in the moſt dark condition and gloomish, Gods face
shines on them; ſo when the wicked are in their proſperity, God ſmites them,
When <hi>the irons entred into Ioſephs ſoule,</hi> God delivered him. When the

                  <hi>I will recover.</hi> From this phraſe of [recovering] obſerve, Firſt, when
men abuſe mercies, they forfeit their right in their mercies, they come then
to be but uſurpers; they are not uſurpers of mercies, meerely for the uſe of
mercies, but for the abuſe of them; they are not charged for their right to
uſe them, but for their not right uſing them, there is great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
theſe two.</p>
               <p>It hath beene taught by many,<note place="margin">how far wicked men have right to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> that all wicked men have no right at all to
uſe any creature, but are to anſwer as uſurpers before God. But certainely
there is a miſtake. It is certain man hath forfeited all, but God hath given a
right to all that they do enjoy in a lawful way, a right by donation. They
have not ſuch a right as the Saints have, a right in Chriſt, once being in Chriſt
we may challence of God all things that are good for us. Another man hath
right, but how? as a malefactor is condemned to dye by his offence, being
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:42662:139"/>
condemned, he hath forfeited all his eſtate, and all the benefit of a ſubject;
But if the King be pleaſed to allow him proviſion for a day or two, till the
time of execution, he cannot be challenged as an uſurper, for that he hath, he
hath it by donation, and it is ſuch a right that all wicked men have; all wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
men in the world are under the ſentence of condemnation, &amp; have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited
their right, and all the good of the creature, only the Lord is pleaſed
out of his bounty to give ſuch and ſuch enjoyments, they shall have ſuch and
ſuch houſes, and ſuch and ſuch lands for a time, till the day of execution
comes.</p>
               <p>This might daunt the hearts of wicked men: you look upon your ſelves
as great men, you have your ſhops full, you have large eſtates, you are like
ſome malefactors, who have a better ſupper before execution then others.
But ſtill your not right uſing may make you uſurpers before God. You give
your ſervant order to buy ſuch and ſuch commodities, ſuppoſe your ſervant
run away with your money, or beſtow it on his whores, &amp;c. if he run away
do you not follow him as a thiefe? you truſt him with ſuch a ſtock, to keepe
ſuch markets, now he hath right to uſe your eſtate; but if he run away with
your eſtate, and uſe it againſt you, if you meet with him again, you will ſay,
what a thief are you to run away with your Maſters eſtate, and abuſe it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him? <hi>I will recover, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All the time the creature ſerves wicked men,<note place="margin">Obſ. 9.</note> it is in bondage, and God

As in ſuch a building as this is, there is lime and ſtone, and morter, but
now the art of man puts a beauty upon them; but ſuppoſe all the art of man

us then? it would bury us in the rubbiſh of it; now it is uſefull and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,

It is a note of <hi>Calvin</hi> upon this, that ſeemes to reach the meaning of
the holy Ghoſt, alluding to the way of whores, who having great men for

and confide in their greatneſs, they care not what their husbands can doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

hence take theſe obſervations.</p>
               <p>Firſt, all wickedneſſe, and eſpecially Idolatry, hath many covers for it;
except we looke very narrowly to thoſe that are ſuperſtitious and idolatrous,
we ſhall not ſee the evill of that ſin. Some covers are ſubtilly woven, but it
may be ſaid of them all as <hi>Iſa. 28. 20. The bed is ſhorter then that a man
can ſtretch himſelfe on it, and the covering narrower then that he can wrap
himſelfe in it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> Proſperity in a ſinfull way is a great cover; though it be a very
vile and ſinfull way, yet proſperity is a cover to it: This gliſters ſo in many
mens eyes, that the filth of ſin is hid, many a foule hand is under a faire per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumed
glove, an ill complexion may have a painted face, and proſperity is
no other to wicked men,<note place="margin">Proſperity hides much filth.</note> then a painted face to a foul woman. As a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
face is no argument of a faire complexion, ſo neither is proſperity of a
good condition. Crooked diſeaſed bodies, halfe rotten, may have fine cloths.
Green leaves on a tree may hide the rifts, the moſſineſs, and blackneſs of the
body which appears in winter.</p>
               <p>Many men are abominable falſe in all their wayes, cruell, and bloody in
their hearts againſt God and good men, their ſpirits are invenomed, and
they have given up themſelves to moſt horrible ſins, yet ſo long as they have
power about them all is covered, were all their proſperity taken from them,
and all their glory and greatneſs, and nothing but their falſhood, and hatred
of the wayes of God appeared, what dreadfull creatures would they bee?
There is many a man that is taken with a ſtrumpet, when ſhee hath painted
her ſelfe bravely like <hi>Iezebel,</hi> but if he ſhould ſee this whore whipped up &amp;

ſhall have the proudeſt ſpirits that are, to bee as crowching and ſubject to
thoſe that are their ſuperiours as any, and ſo by ſeeming humility, cover a
great deale of pride. So the evill of ceremonies, and falſe diſcipline, paſſe
without much contradiction, you muſt not trouble your ſelves about theſe
things, and why have not we as wholſome ſoule-ſaving doctrine as in any
Church in the world? becauſe of this the corruption of the other is covered,

ſee their friend ſhot, they look aloofe from him. Wee have had wofull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of this of late, when many godly Miniſters were perſecuted, thoſe

they flye upon him. It is apparant by this, that men in their proſperity are
not regarded for any thing in themſelves, but for their proſperities ſake, for
their moneys ſake, for their cloathes ſake. Suppoſe any of you have a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant

the reſpect that is given, is not for your ſake, but for your ſervants ſake, you

take it very ill. This is all the reſpect that men have from falſe lovers, it is not
for any good in them, it is for their proſperity, for their ſervants ſake; O how
vaine is reſpect from the world! If you be gracious, God will not deal with
you thus; if you have your eſtates taken from you, God will not deſpiſe you
as carnall friends doe. <hi>Pſal. 22. 24. For he hath not deſpiſed nor abhorred

hide his face from them, but <hi>when they cry to him he hears them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet further we ſee here, carnall hearts have a great deale of confidence in
many things they truſt to,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> in time of danger they will not believe but they
ſhall eſcape. Let us not be troubled at the confidence our enemies have, they
doubt not but to prevaile; this is from the curſe of God upon them; their caſe
is never ſo deſperate, but they have ſomething to ſhelter themſelves in their
own thoughts: Oh what a ſhame is it that any thing is rather truſted in, then
God! the husbandman caſts ſeed-corn that coſts dearer then any other corne

If you goe to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> you truſt your lives in a boat halfe an inch thicke,

               <p>Laſtly, when God ſets himſelfe againſt a generation of men, or any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
all the means in the world ſhall not help. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9. the Prophet had
a viſion of ſix men with weapons of war in their hands; there were ſix prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
gates in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and God would ſet theſe ſixe men with weapons
in their hands at each gate, that if they run to this, or the other, or any gate,
the man with the weapon in his hand ſhould be ſure to take them, they
ſhould not eſcape.</p>

                  <hi>Amos, 5. 8. Seeke him that maketh the ſeven Stars and Orion;</hi> Why
are theſe named <hi>ſeven ſtars and Orion;</hi> the one is the extreame of cold, and
the other of heate; The Lord hath the power of both: if they eſcape the heat,

               <p>Hence there is ſuch blaſting of means, for the curſing of thoſe whom God
ſets himſelfe againſt; let us not be afraid of the great aſſiſtance that our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries
have, though they have great aſſiſtance, they are in Gods hand,
and none can deliver out of Gods hand; all their ſtrength is but as tow and

they ſuccumb, they fall downe under the leaſt weight of affliction; They
ſeeme to have brave ſpirits, to out-brave the word of God, but they have
poore, meane, and low ſpirits when they come to beare Gods hand upon

but darkneſſe and blackneſſe within, nothing but guilt and gnawings of the

               <p>It were well if it were always ſo with us when God calleth us to feaſting,
(as ſometimes he doth, though not now) that our hearts were alwayes up in
our feaſting, warmed and inlarged to do much good. It is that which hath
been the honour of this Citie, that in their Companies feaſting yearly, they
were wont heretofore uſually when they had rejoyced one with another,

in which they were borne, and then to reſolve to ſend the preaching of
the Word to ſuch a great Town where moſt of them were bred, and to ſuch

               <p>Their hearts were put all agog with their feaſts, but God hath a time to
take away feaſting times from a people, a time when thoſe who have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted

               <p>For Kingdomes alſo, though there be times for feaſting, yet there is a
time of mourning; and God ſeems this day to be comming to us to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
our feaſts, to call upon us to ſpend our times in another way; It were
good for us to do what we can to prevent God, by humbling our ſelves in a
voluntary way, to take away our owne Feaſts, and to change our Feſtivities
into Humiliations. The times call for faſting now, rather then feaſting;<note place="margin">We muſt not then feaſt when God calls for mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note>
and it is a moſt dreadfull ſin then for men to give liberty to themſelves for
feaſting, when God calls for mourning and faſting. It is not at your liberty
to feaſt when you will.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22. 12. is a moſt dreadfull place, that might make the hearts of thoſe
who are guilty in this kinde tremble. <hi>Verſ. 12. And in that day did the
Lord of hoſts call to mourning, and to girding with ſackcloath, and behold
joy and gladneſs, ſlaying oxen, killing ſheep, drinking wine. Surely this ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
ſhall not be purged from you till you die, ſaith the Lord God of Hoſts.</hi>
While the bread is taken away from our brethren, and the land is ſo miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
ſpoyled, and when ſuch a black cloud hangeth over our heads, here is
no time for Feſtivities. Whatſoever your cuſtomes have been, at this time
now coming (I mean that which you call your Chriſtmas Feſtivity) you
are certainely bound now to turne it into a time of mourning; For if wee
ſhould grant it lawfull for men to appoint Holy-days that way, for feaſting,
(of which more by and by) yet certainly it cannot be but a ſinfull thing, ſo
to ſet thoſe dayes apart, as whatſoever providence of God falls out, yet they
will continue what they themſelves have ſet. You will all grant this, that if it
be lawfull to keep this time of Feſtivity, yet this not that that God himſelfe
hath ſet apart and enjoyned. We never have it required by Chriſt, or by
his Apoſtles, that at ſuch a time, juſt when the yeer cometh about, that wee
ſhould have ſolemn dayes of Feſtivity. Well then, at the moſt, if we ſuppoſe
it lawfull, it is but the inſtitution of man; if it be mans inſtitution, then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
it muſt give way to Gods work, to providence. For man to put ſo
much upon his inſtitution, becauſe hee hath appointed ſuch a day when the
yeer cometh about to rejoyce in, that whatſoever worke of God falls out in
the mean time, that calls for humiliation and faſting, yet hee will hold to his
own inſtitution; what is this my brethren but to <hi>make the commandements
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:42662:146"/>
of God to be of none effect through mans tradition?</hi> It is apparent breach of
that Scripture. For this is certaine now that it is the commandement of God
that you ſhould mourne and faſt, if then becauſe of mans inſtitution you
will put by the command of God, and now ſpend time in feaſting and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing,
which ought not to be but in ſuch times when God ſhines upon a
Kingdom in wayes of mercy, know this is ſin unto you. If you can ſay that
God ſhines upon us now in preſent extraordinary mercies then we may feaſt.
I confeſs they are extraordinary mercies in regard of what wee may hope to
be the event and effect of them; but for the adminiſtrations of God towards
us, they are ſuch as if ever they called for faſting, they call for it at this day.
Therefore here by Gods works amongſt us, wee know we have Gods will
revealed to us, namely to faſt; the other at moſt is but mans inſtitution and
tradition. Now the traditions of man muſt yeeld to the commandements
of God.</p>
               <p>With what conſcience now can you take ſuch a plentifull uſe of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and ſuffer your brethren to want cloaths and bread? If God have yet
granted to you ſuch a comfortable eſtate that you have ſo much to ſpare as
to feaſt, know you are bound in conſcience then to lay out that in relieving
your brethren who have been ſo cruelly uſed, therefore God brings them to
you to be objects of your compaſſion. It would be very acceptable to God
if ſo much as any of you have uſually ſpent in feaſtings, or intended to ſpend
in theſe twelve dayes, you would ſet it now apart for the reliefe of thoſe who
want bread, and ſet the time apart alſo for mourning in your families, that
God would pardon the ſinne of theſe times formerly committed. And now
not only feaſts in private Families ſhould ceaſe, but the feaſts of Companies
in your publique Halls likewiſe.</p>
               <p>What abundance of poor plundered people might be relieved, if all that
were ſpent in one yeere in the feaſts of your companies, were laid aſide for
their uſe! Theſe are times for mercy, not for feſtivity; if wee will not ceaſe
our feaſtings, let us know, God hath thouſands of wayes to take away feaſts
from a kingdome, and to bring <hi>cleanneſs of teeth</hi> among us, <hi>I will take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
their feaſts,</hi> ſaith the Lord.</p>
               <p>The main thing in this verſe to be opened to you, is, what theſe feaſts of

               <p>The Jewes had their <hi>Civill</hi> feaſts, and their <hi>Holy</hi> feaſts.</p>
               <p>Amongſt their Holy feaſts, ſome were of Gods appointment, and ſome
of their own.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="289" facs="tcp:42662:146"/>
Of Gods appointment, ſome were more ſolemn, ſome leſſe.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>Civill feaſts</hi> were times wherein they tooke a more liberall uſe of
the creature, in rejoycing one with another upon ſome ſpecially occaſion,
this they called <hi>a Good day,</hi> not <hi>a Holy day,</hi> ſo you have it, <hi>Eſth. 8. 17. The
Jewes had joy and gladneſſe, a feaſt and a good day,</hi> ſo they were wont to
expreſſe the day of feaſting, <hi>facere Bonum diem,</hi> to make <hi>a Good day</hi> to
their brethren, it will appeare by examining that Text of <hi>Eſther,</hi> that that
day thought it was ſet to be kept every yeer, yet it was but as a good day to
them, and could not be ſaid to be a holy-day; we do not read of any religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ſolemne exerciſe that they had for the day: Such a day I take to bee our
fifth of <hi>November,</hi> a <hi>Good day,</hi> not a <hi>Holy-day,</hi> wherein wee have a more
liberall uſe of the creature then at other times, and remember the mercies of
God with thankſgiving: But wee know the day is not ſet apart for this end,
ſo as it is unlawfull to be exerciſed in any other thing, and we ſhall ſhew af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward,
how that dayes cannot be ſet apart Annually, or be made holy by
men.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>Religious feaſts</hi> which they preſumed themſelves to make holy,
were [their] feaſts rather then Gods, and for that you have the example of
<hi>Jeroboam,</hi> he appointed a feaſt even of his own head; it is in 1 <hi>King.</hi> 12.
32, 33. <hi>And Jeroboam</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>ordained a feaſt in the eighth
month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feaſt which is in Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,
ſo hee offered upon the Altar which hee had made in Bethel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">We muſt not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume in way of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itation to God to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe things in his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship like to his former inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> 
                  <hi>the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
day of the eighth month, even in the month which hee had deviſed of
his owne heart, and ordained a feaſt unto the children of Iſrael.</hi> Marke
here, <hi>Ieroboam</hi> is rebuked for appointing a feaſt of his owne heart, like the
feaſt God had appointed; this is no excuſe that he would be an imitator of
God. This reaſon many think will juſtifie their ſuperſtitious way, they do
but imitate what God did, as thus, God had an Ephod for the Prieſts, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they will have a holy garment; God had a Temple conſecrated, they
will have one ſo too God had his feaſt days and holy-dayes, they will have
theirs too in imitation of God. This very thing that <hi>Ieroboam</hi> did, hee is
rebuked for, that he would ſet up a thing like unto Gods.</p>
               <p>Where God hath ſet his ſtamp upon any thing, wee muſt take heed wee
preſume not to ſet our own ſtamp. Suppoſe any one ſhould take a piece of
ſilver, &amp; ſhould ſet juſt the ſame ſtamp as neer as he can that the King doth
upon his coine, be it but a two-pence, the ſilver is his owne; well, but if he
come to be examined, Why do you thus? What hurt ſaith he is there in
it? I have done no more then the King, I have done but as he did; Why,
may we not follow his example? will this anſwer think you ſerve his turne?
It is as much as his life is worth: Juſt ſuch a plea is this, they will doe ſuch
and ſuch things in Gods worſhip, why? God hath done ſo before, and they
doe but imitate God; There is as much ſtrength in the one as in the other.
Therefore that word here [<hi>deviſed of his owne heart</hi>] in the Hebrew comes
from a word that ſignifies <hi>to lye,</hi>

<pb n="290" facs="tcp:42662:147"/>
the tokens of the lyars,</hi> it is the ſame word: <hi>Jeroboam</hi> indeed in ſetting
this day apart, he did it under a pretence to honour and worſhip God, but
though it might ſeeme to make Gods honour and worſhip better then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
yet the Scripture puts the lie upon it, ſo the word is; I thinke this was
the reaſon he ſet it apart in the eighth month, the Feaſt of Tabernacles was
the fifteenth day of the ſeventh month; now he would not alter the day, but
have it the ſame day that Gods was, but in the eighth month, for the Feaſt of
Tabernacles was appointed for this end, to praiſe God for the in-gathering
of the fruits of the earth, and it was as upon our September; Now becauſe
upon the fifteenth of September perhaps all the creatures were not gathered
in, there might be ſome remaining abroad, therefore <hi>Ieroboam</hi> might have
this device, he would ſtay till every thing be gathered in, till they had it in
their barnes, and in their veſſels; when they had it all fully in, and it was fit
to eate and drinke, then ſaith <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> now it is the time to praiſe God, you
praiſed God before when you were taking in of the fruits, but you have not
taken them all in, you cannot come to uſe them, but now having them all in,
and now being able to make uſe of them, now is the time to praiſe God.</p>
               <p>This was <hi>Jeroboams</hi> wiſdome, and he thought to make a Feaſt to take
the people rather then Gods Feaſt. There are no ſuperſtitious men but will
have ſome argument and plea for their wayes, to take the hearts of people
to embrace thoſe wayes rather then Gods ſimple, plaine and pure Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.
Well, but though <hi>Jeroboam</hi> did it under this pretence, yet hee lies
ſtill; ſo thoſe men that will take upon them to ſanctifie dayes, or places, or
garments, or any geſture that God never did, though they ſay they doe it
for Gods honour, to make Gods worſhip more glorious and decent; yet it
is a lie: Juſt as thoſe who will make Images, brave golden Images <hi>of</hi>

they are full of lies.</p>
               <p>Here now ariſeth the Queſtion about mans appointing Feaſts, whether
there may he holy Feaſts (taken ſo in a proper ſence) by mans appointment?
<hi>Ieroboam</hi> is accuſed for it plainly: and <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 10. there is a charge upon the
<hi>Galatians,</hi> and that very ſeverely. <hi>You obſerve dayes, and months, &amp; times,

                     </gap>t I have beſtowed upon you labour in vaine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It appeares by this that peoples hearts are mightily ſet upon their Feaſts,
their dayes, and months, and yeeres, they were loath to be taken off from
them, ſo that the Apoſtle ſpeakes with a deale of bitterneſſe of ſpirit, <hi>I am
afraid of you that I have loſt my labour;</hi> and indeed when godly Miniſters
take paines amongſt people whoſe hearts are ſet upon ſuch things as theſe,
for the moſt part they looſe their labour, little good is done.</p>
               <p>Yea will ſome ſay, to obſerve the Jewiſh dayes after they were aboliſhed
by God, that was ſinfull and dangerous, but we doe not keepe Jewiſh days.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="291" facs="tcp:42662:147"/>
But mark what theſe men ſay, God aboliſheth his owne, and yet they
thinke hee gives liberty to man to ſet up others. If this were ſo, that upon
Gods aboliſhing his own, men ſhould have liberty to ſet up theirs, then the
Chriſtians are under a more heavy bondage and grievous paedagogie then
ever the Jewes were, for it is better to have a hundred days of Gods appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
then one of mans, it is more honourable. Further, if God appoint,
there needs no ſcruple, as there is if man appoint; yea, if God appoint, wee
may expect a ſpeciall bleſſing, and efficacy, and preſence of God, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
expect ſuch things in mans appointment. Now if this were ſo, when
God hath taken away Jewiſh Ceremonies, man might lawfully appoint o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
as he pleaſeth, and when God hath taken away Iewiſh dayes, man
might appoint other dayes, we may pray to God with good reaſon to bring
us under the pedagogie of the Law again, rather then to be thus under mans
power.</p>
               <p>Thus farre we grant, that upon any ſpeciall work of God, the very revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of the yeare hath a naturalneſſe in it to put me in mind of ſuch a thing,
and ſo farre as there is a naturalneſſe in it, there is good in it, I may make uſe
of it. Therefore I dare not ſay that is altogether unlawfull at ſuch times to
have ſome outward rejoycing, when God doth not call for mourning ſome
other way, (except the argument from the extraordinary abuſe there hath
been of it may be of force) Nay that there may be advantage taken of the
peoples leaſure, to preach the word, and to heare Sermons upon ſuch dayes
we deny not. Wee know that Chriſt was in the Porch of the Temple at the
feaſt of Dedication, which was one of the dayes of their owne appointing,
not that he was there to countenance or honor the Feaſt, but becauſe he had
been there before at another Feaſt of Gods appointment. Now there being
a multitude of people at that time alſo gathered together, he takes advantage
of the concourſe of the people to come to the out-porch to preach to them.
So much therefore as we may grant, we will not deny.</p>
               <p>For the underſtanding of this point, the ſetting apart days, I ſuppoſe there
are theſe two things will be queſtioned.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Why may not governours of the Church ſet apart dayes, as well as
appoint times for preaching, or as well as others of themſelves will appoint
ſuch times, as once a week ſo much time ſet apart for a Lecture?</p>
               <p>Secondly, VVe may appoint faſt dayes, and dayes of thanksgiving, theſe
are ſet apart by man, how cometh it to paſſe then that this can bee cleare
that a man may appoint a time for preaching conſtantly once a weeke, and
he may appoint times of faſting, and dayes of thankeſgiving, and yet not
have this liberty, to make a day that may be properly called a holy-day?</p>
               <p>VVe muſt cleare that point from this objection, or elſe we do nothing;
and for the clearing this wee muſt know there is a great deale of difference
in theſe three things, the right underſtanding of which will cleare all the
matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="292" facs="tcp:42662:148"/>
Between deputation, and dedication, and ſanctification of a thing.</p>
               <p>I may depute a creature to be made uſe of to help me in holy things, and
yet ſtill this creature is not ſanctifyed by its deputation,<note place="margin">Why a day may not be made holy as well as time ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part for a Lecture.</note> and ſo we do a time
for a Lecture, ſuch an houre in ſuch a day deputed, but the time is not made
holy by it the place is deputed, but is not made holy by it.</p>
               <p>Yea I will appoint ſuch a garment that I have when I am in ſuch a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
ſuch a day to weare, but yet the garment is not made holy by it. A crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is not made holy meerely by being made uſe of at holy exerciſe or in a
holy thing. As thus, ſuppoſe I goe to reade the holy Scripture, I make uſe
of a candle to reade it by, I doe not make the candle holy by this, becauſe I
make uſe of it. If the making uſe of a creature in a holy duty did make the
creature holy, then it would fall out generally in all creatures. I make uſe of
the very light and the ayre when I am reading and ſpeaking holy things in
publicke aſſemblies, I do not make the light and ayre holy, becauſe I make
uſe of them in holy things; ſo I make uſe of this houre to preach in, though
I make uſe of it in a holy duty, I make it no further holy then a man doth
his ſpectacles that he uſeth to reade the Scripture by. A deputation is this,
when ſuch a creature as I ſhal think moſt commodius for ſuch a ſervice ſhal
be put a part for ſuch a ſervice, or when ſuch a creature, as I have uſe of for
ſuch a ſervice, will be a naturall and uſefull help to me, to appoint it for that
ſervice upon that ground.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is dedication, that is when I give a thing out of my own pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,<note place="margin">VVhat it is to dedicate a thing.</note>
for a pious uſe, that I cannot make uſe of for any thing again. As when
a man hath given ſo much of his eſtate to build a School or an Hoſpitall, it
may be ſaid to be a kinde of dedication, he hath devoted, given ſo much of
his eſtate to that end, ſo that hee cannot make uſe of it himſelfe to another
end. Now we doe not ſo ſet apart the time of preaching, as that we cannot
make uſe of this time for any other end, wee may as wee ſee cauſe alter it,
where it is from 9. to 11, we make it from two to four, whereas if it were a
thing that we had dedicated, that is given out of our own power then it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be changed by us. That is a ſecond degree, this is not ſanctifying yet.</p>
               <p>Now ſanctification is beyond dedication, that is when any creature or
time is ſo ſet apart for holy things as it muſt not be uſed in any thing but
that that is holy;<note place="margin">VVhat it is to ſanctifi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> a thing.</note> and though the ſame holy actions be done at another time,
and with the uſe of another creature, they ſhall not be accounted ſo holy as
at this time, and when this creature was made uſe of.</p>
               <p>This is the proper ſanctification, and the ſetting apart of any day thus,
that is, ſuch a day God giveth to me to make uſe of for my occaſions, if <hi>I</hi>
ſhall thus ſet it a part, ſo devote it for ſuch a buſineſſe, as it may not without
ſin to me (whatſoever falleth out) be uſed to any other occaſion.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, when <hi>I</hi> have ſet it apart <hi>I</hi> ſhall put ſo much in it as if the
ſame holy actions be performed to another time, they ſhall not be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
ſo holy as at this time, although that time hath as much natural fitneſſe
in it, now I ſanctifie time to my ſelfe, but thus I cannot doe without ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="293" facs="tcp:42662:148"/>
You ſhall finde that there are theſe two things in all holy feaſts, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
in all things that are accounted holy.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it was a ſinne for them to make uſe of that time for any other thing,
or any other wayes then God had appointed: Secondly, the actions that
they did at that time were ſuch as were more acceptable to God then if they
had done the ſame thing at another time. Yea it was ſo in their very days
of humiliation, that were once a yeere, a day of Expiation, this day muſt
not be uſed for any thing elſe; and if they humbled themſelves or faſted u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
another day, that would not have beene ſo acceptable to God as upon
this day.</p>
               <p>So wee ſhall ſee it in all ſuperſtitions of men when they ſet apart either
dayes, or places, or things, they put theſe two upon them.</p>
               <p>As for places, They ſay we appoint a place for people to meet in a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
way; yes, but when comes it to be ſuperſtitious? Thus firſt when it
comes ſo to be ſet apart, ſo as <hi>I</hi> ſhall make conſcience of uſing it to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
uſe but this; Secondly, when <hi>I</hi> ſhall be perſwaded in my conſcience
that God accepts of ſervice done him in this place better then in any other
though as decent as this. So for ſuperſtitious garments. You will ſay, may
not Miniſters be decent? <hi>I</hi> have heard a great Doctor give this argument
for a ſurplice; ſomtime ſaith he <hi>I</hi> ride abroad to preach and my cloake is
dirty, is it fit for me to come into a Pulpit with a dirty garment? and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there is alwayes appointed ſomewhat to cover it; it is decent.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe it be ſo, but if it be ſo that this garment muſt be made uſe of for
nothing but ſuch a holy exerciſe, and ſecondly if <hi>I</hi> thinke the wearing of it
doth honour the ſervice, and that God accepts of the ſervice performed in
ſuch a garment rather then in another, this is ſuperſtition; as in one place
in Suffolke when that garment was loſt, there was a ſtrict injunction to
the poore countrey men that there might not be any ſervice or ſermon till
they had got another: for which they were appointed ten dayes, and this
being upon a friday, there were two Sabbaths without any ſervice, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is apparent they put the acceptation of the duty upon it. So for days,
for any man to ſet apart a day, ſo that it ſhall be a ſin, that a mans conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
ſhall condemne him before Ged as ſinning againſt him, if he doe any
thing upon that day but ſuch holy duties. Secondly, That though the ſame
holy duties be done upon another day, they ſhall not be accounted ſo accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to God as done upon that day, this is ſuperſtitious. Yer certainly of
this nature have many of our dayes been, for if you opened your ſhops, what
a deale of diſturbance was there in the city! It was a profaning of the day, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Proctor and ſuch fellowes had power given them to moleſt you: 2.
did not they account it a greater honour to God for to have ſervice read that
day then to have it read upon an ordinary teuſday or thurſday? yea preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon a Lecture day that was not one of their holy dayes, they accounted
not ſo acceptable unto God as ſervice upon that day. Here comes their inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
their inſtitution puts upon it more then God puts upon it, ſo it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to be ſinfull.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="294" facs="tcp:42662:149"/>
So if you ſhould ſet apart this time you call Chriſtmas, ſo as you ſhould
make conſcience of doing any other ſervice or worke that day, and beſides,
you ſhould think that to remember Chriſt and to bleſſe God for Chriſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
another day is not ſo acceptable to God as to doe it upon that day, here
comes in the evill of thus putting mans inſtitution upon dayes.</p>
               <p>Well, but this is not cleare<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> except we anſwer another objection. But
doth not the King and Parliament command dayes of faſting and dayes of
thankſgiving, and are not they of the ſame nature? Will not you ſay it is ſin
for us to open ſhops upon theſe dayes.</p>
               <p>I anſwer,<note place="margin">How it may be lawfull to ſet apart faſting dayes and how not.</note> our dayes for faſting and thankſgiving have not thoſe two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients
in them, for firſt, if God by his providence call any particular man
to any particular buſineſſe in his family, then (let this man take heed he doe
not appeare in a way of contempt) he need not have his conſcience condemn
him though he ſpend all that day in that buſineſſe. They may ſet apart a
day to be ſpent publickly, yet with this limitation, not to enjoyne every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
man, that whatſoever Gods providence calls him to in particular buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
he muſt leave off all, &amp; make as much conſcience of doing this as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Lords day.</p>
               <p>You will ſay, upon the Lords day, if we have any extraordinary thing fall
out, we may go a journey or doe buſineſſe, as a Phyſitian may ride up and
down, workes of mercy may be done, therefore this makes no difference
betweene Gods day and theſe of mans appointment.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, Though a Phyſitian doe a worke of mercy upon the Sabbath
day, yet he is bound to doe it with a Sabbath dayes heart, as a work of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
whatſoever calls him off from thoſe ſervices that are Gods imediate
worſhip, he muſt doe that thing with a Sabbath dayes frame of heart, he is
bound in conſcience to doe it ſo, and he ſinneth againſt God if he rides up
and down to Patients with ſuch a heart as he may doe it upon another day, he
may follow it as a buſineſſe of his calling upon another day, but not ſo now;
but if he do it with a Sabbath dayes frame of heart as a worke of mercy, he
keeps the Sabbath in that. But if there were a neceſſity upon a Faſt day to
ride, a mans conſcience need not to condemne him before God, if he went
about that worke as the worke of his calling at that time. It is not therefore
ſo dedicated but Gods providence may take us off to doe other civill acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and that as the works of our calling. Secondly, Neither is it ſo ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as if the ſame works done at another day were not ſo acceptable to God
as done upon this day. As our faſt dayes ſet upon the laſt wedneſday of the
Moneth, to thinke that the worke done upon another day were not ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to God as done upon that day, this is a ſanctification of the day, and
ſuch a ſanctification is ſinne. The ſame anſwer may be given for dayes of
thanksgiving. Beſides, yet there is another thing conſiderable, that is in the
ſtating of the time. Though men may thus depute and appoint dayes to
worſhip God, yet they cannot ſtate any ſuch dayes, but onely as Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
calls them to it, according to the preſent occaſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="295" facs="tcp:42662:149"/>
Therefore it were certainly a ſin if a ſtate ſhould appoint once every yeer
to be a faſting day in a religious way, God did ſo, but men have no power
to do ſo, the reaſon is this, becauſe they doe not know but God may call
them to rejoycing upon that day, they have not the liberty of the time. All
that we can doe is this, when God calleth us to faſting, wee muſt appoint
dayes of faſting; when God calls us to rejoycing we muſt appoint dayes of
rejoycing. Therefore to appoint the time of Lent as a religious faſt is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and the Statute it ſelfe threatneth a mulct upon that man that ſhall call it
a religious faſt; for civill ends it may be, but ſtated faſts which are not limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by providence, are certainly evil; and ſo for theſe monthly faſts that are
now injoyned, if we ſhould ſay we will have a faſt once a moneth upon this
day theſe twelve moneths, or theſe two yeers, I perſwade my ſelfe the State
ſhould ſin: but to have it as long as Gods hand is upon us, as long as the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
laſteth, and Gods providence calls us to it, that is juſtifiable.</p>
               <p>Our Brethren in Scotland wholly deny both ſtated Faſts and all other
dayes: Nay they will ſcarce agree to this monthly faſting we have, becauſe
they are ſo loth to yeeld to any <hi>ſtat a jeiunia.</hi> And I remember I have heard
of a ſpeech King <hi>James</hi> once made in Scotland, bleſſing God that hee was
borne at ſuch a time, and was a member of ſuch a Church; and the reaſon
he giveth is this: For, ſaith he, the Church of Scotland exceeds in this all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Churches. England though it hath pure doctrine, hath not pure diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline;
other Reformed Churches have pure doctrine and diſcipline, but
they retaine the obſervation of many holy dayes; but the Church of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
hath pure doctrine and diſcipline, and keeps no holy dayes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſaith he, it is a purer Church then any in the world.</p>
               <p>Thus I have endeavoured to ſhew you how far things may be ſet apart, &amp;
how far not, when it commeth to be a ſinne for any one to ſanctifie a day.</p>
               <p>By this we may ſee what a mercy it is to be delivered from thoſe men who
have robbed the Kingdome of ſo many dayes as they have, and put ſo many
ſuperſtitious reſpects upon them, and ſo have involved us in much guilt,
bleſſe God for delivering us from them, and for thoſe dayes that God giveth
us liberty to exerciſe our ſelves in his worſhip, let us know our liberty in
them. Thus much for thoſe Feaſts that are called <hi>their</hi> Feaſts, that were of
their owne appointment.</p>
               <p>Her new moons.</p>
               <p>The ordinance of God in the new moons is in <hi>Numb. 28. 11. In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of your new moons</hi> you ſhall doc thus and thus,<note place="margin">The feaſt of new moons o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened.</note> &amp;c. It was Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
that the Jews at the beginning of every month ſhould have a holy
day, when they had a new moon they ſhould keep that day holy to God.</p>
               <p>That which the Latines call <hi>Calends,</hi> were their <hi>new moones.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The holy ſolemnity of theſe dayes was in three things. Firſt, the offerings
that were there appointed by God particularly for that time, were many &amp; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
chargeable, two young bullocks, &amp; one ram, ſeven lambs of the firſt yeer
without ſpot, beſides their flower &amp; oyl for their drink offerings, and one kid
of the goats for a ſin-offering.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="296" facs="tcp:42662:150"/>
Secondly, At theſe times they were wont to repaire to the Prophets for
inſtruction, to know the mind of God. That you have 2 <hi>King.</hi> 4. 23. where
the husband of the Shunamire ſaid to his wife, <hi>wherefore wilt thou goe to
him to day? it is neither new moone nor ſabbath.</hi> Indeed if it were new
moon or ſabbath you may goe, but while it is neither, why will you goe?
That implyeth that this was a thing in uſe among the Jewes to repaire to the
Prophets for inſtruction, and to heare Gods word from them upon thoſe
dayes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, yea it was unlawfull to buy and ſell upon thoſe dayes, <hi>Amos.</hi> 8.
5. <hi>When will the new moone be gone that we may ſell corn?</hi> they were wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

               <p>Theſe three things we finde in Scripture upon their new moones.<note place="margin">Benedct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us eſto conditor t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But why did God appoint this feaſt of the new moone?</p>
               <p>It was appointed for theſe 4. ends.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. Becauſe God would be acknowledged to have the government of all
inferiour things in the world, and eſpecially of all the changes of times. As
the Sabbath was for putting us in minde of Gods creating the world, ſo the
new moones were appointed for them to bleſſe God for the government of
the world, for many nations have attributed much of the government of the
things of the world to the moone; the tydes you know ebbe and flow ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the moone, the great worke of God in the ſeas ſeeme to bee go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
by God in the uſe of that creature, yea things ſeeme to be governed
more ſenſibly by this creature then by others, to the end therefore that they
might not ſticke in the creature, but give God the glory: therefore hee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
the feaſts of the new moone;<note place="margin">Ier. 44. 17. 18. 19.</note> if they had any changes of times and
ſeaſons, God cauſed it, rather then this creature, and as the heathens, ſo they
called the Moone <hi>the Queene of Heaven,</hi> and they would not be taken off
from offering cakes to the Queene of heaven, they attributed all their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity
to her, as we reade in the Prophet. Now from this, God would take
them off, therefore he appointed this ſolemn feaſt of the new moone,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="297" facs="tcp:42662:150"/>
2. God would hereby teach, that the bringing of any light unto us after
darkneſſe is meerly from himſelf, and he muſt be acknowledged in it. The <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
Moone is a glorious creature, and cauſeth much light, but ſoone after there
is darkneſſe, and after this darkneſſe light ſpringeth up againe. Here is the
work of God, we are taught a morall leſſon from this Feaſt, that is, Hath
God at any time brought darkneſſe upon a Kingdome, or upon a Family,
or upon a particular ſoul, doth he begin to bring light? He muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
and praiſed for it.</p>
               <p>3. God would teach them this alſo, that the beginnings of all mercies are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
to be dedicated to him; when God reneweth a mercy, at the very firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it comes to perfection, it is to be given up unto God; they were to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate
this Feaſt upon the beginning of the light of the Moon.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, which is more, this aymed at Chriſt, as all other Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of the Law did. It pointed out our condition in our depending upon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
Chriſt, for our light muſt be renewed by our conjunction with Jeſus Chriſt
who is the Sun of righteouſneſſe; as the light of the Moone is renewed by her
conjunction with the Sun, that gives the great light to the world. And as
the light of the Moon increaſeth, as it takes it from the Sunne, ſo doth our
light increaſe as we take it from the Sun of Righteouſneſſe. Thus this feaſt
was typicall, and thus we ſee theſe feaſts were of ſpeciall uſe.</p>
               <p>But when they come to abuſe theſe Feaſts, ſaith God, I will take them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
you ſhall have no more; and therefore <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. God profeſſeth <hi>a loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their feaſts,</hi> and amongſt others of their <hi>New Moones.</hi> Not but
that they were holy in themſelves, but when they came to abuſe them, by
adding their owne ſuperſtitious vanities, or elſe had not the due end for
which God appointed them, then God is offended. Now ſaith God, you
acknowledg darkneſſe to be from me, and light to be from me, and change
of time to be from me, but what uſe do you make of your time? You ſeeme
to give up the mercies you receive unto me, but you do not honour me with
them, nor for them.</p>
               <p>You ſeem to think of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> in theſe things, but your hearts are not
with him, but all your wayes are after your luſts. I loath your feaſts. Juſt
as if a man comes to God, and prays devoutly, <hi>Lord lead me not into temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi>
and aſſoon as he has done, he preſently goes into wicked company,
God loatheth you for going quite croſſe to your prayers; you pray, <hi>Lord
give us this day our daily bread,</hi> as if you ſhould ſay, Lord I depend upon
thee every day for my bread, and for a bleſſing upon all my outward eſtate;
and aſſoon as you have done, you cozen, and cheat, and goe preſently to the
Devill for your bread: God loatheth theſe prayers of yours, as God loatheth
their New Moons, becauſe when he appointed ſuch a worſhip for thoſe and
thoſe ends, yet they went quite contrary.</p>
               <p>Yet there are two th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ngs exceeding obſervable about theſe New Moones.
We often read of theſe things, but we paſſe them over and do but little mind
them.</p>

                  <pb n="298" facs="tcp:42662:151"/>
Firſt, God will have the glory of his creature, of the New Moone, and
that ſolemnly, yet it muſt be at that time when the Moon is very little, ſcarce
any at all, it muſt not be at the full, when the Moon is moſt glorious, God
doth not call to be glorified in that creature when it is fulleſt of glory; but
when that creature is (as wee may ſay) in the meaneſt condition, when it
hath but a little light beginning, ſcarce any at all, then God will be glorified.
This is the inſtruction and morall leſſon from hence, which is no ſtrained
one, but I think intended by God himſelfe, in appointing this feaſt, in that
God will have the glory due to him from this creature in the beginning of
its light, rather then at any other time. We are taught in this,</p>
               <p>That there is a great deale of danger when we are giving God the glory of
the creature,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> of ſticking in the creature, and not paſſing through the creature
ſpeedily enough, and going from it to God. God is very jealous of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
this way. God hath made many glorious creatures indeed, &amp; he would
have his glory from all his creatures, he would have us give due eſteeme to
his creature; but when we eſteem it for any excellency there is in it, God is
jealous leſt any of his glory ſhould ſtick in the creature, therefore he cals for
it at that time when the creature is moſt meane. That is the reaſon that <hi>Gods</hi>
Ordinances are ſo plain, we have but plaine bread, and plain wine, and a
plaintable, and no brave pompous attire, becauſe <hi>God</hi> ſaw that when wee
are to deale with him ſpiritually, if we had pompous things we would ſticke
there; and we ſee men that are taken ſo with pompous things, they give not
God that glory that is due to him, but they ſtick much in the creature, and
honour it rather then God. It ſeems that the Heathens making the Moone
to be their goddeſſe, eſpecially looked at it when it was moſt light, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
<hi>Iob</hi> 31. therefore <hi>Iob</hi> to cleare himſelfe from that idolatry, ſaith, <hi>If
I beheld the Sunne when it ſhined, or the Moone walking in brightneſſe:</hi>
They uſed to worſhip the Moon thus when they ſaw it <hi>walke in brightnes,</hi>
becauſe they could not reach the Moon, they <hi>kiſt their hand,</hi> and ſo bowed
to the Moon in acknowledgment of a Deity, therefore <hi>Job</hi> would free him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
from that, <hi>If I beheld the Moone walking in brightneſſe, or if my
mouth have kiſſed my hand,</hi> that is, ſaith he, I have not worſhipped this cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature.
This is it I note it for, that when the creature is moſt glorious, there
is danger of giving God the leſſe. It is thus with us many times, God
hath many times more glory from us when our eſtates are little, then when
they are very great; there is many a man, who when hee hath beene in full
light of proſperity never minded God, bus when God hath brought him
into darkneſſe, then he hath given God glory, and then it hath been indeed
moſt acceptable, becauſe then he ſees Gods hand helping him without the
creature.</p>
               <p>Further, God had moſt glory from the Moon when it had the leaſt light,
ſo God may have glory from us though our light be extinguiſhed, it is no
great matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> There is yet another thing that is remarkable concerning this Feaſt. You
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:42662:151"/>
ſhal obſerve what difference there is between the Feaſts of the new Moones
by Gods appointment under the Law,<note place="margin">Lect. 9.</note> and the Feaſts of the new Moones as
they are ſet forth to us in <hi>Ezek.</hi> I lay this for a ground, that thoſe Chapters in
<hi>Ezek.</hi> from the fourth &amp; ſo on, though they ſeem to ſpeak of the Iews cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
and Temple, and Feaſts, yet the ſcope of thoſe texts is to ſet out the
glorious condition of the Church of God in the time of the Goſpel; As in <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa.</hi>
66. 22. <hi>Then they ſhal worſhip me from Sabbath to Sabbath, and from
Moon to Moone,</hi> that is, their conſtant worſhip ſhal be in compariſon as a
Sabbath, and they ſhal not only worſhip me at the beginning of the Moon,
but all times, their worſhip ſhal be ſo full &amp; ſo conſtant: Therefore though
in that place of <hi>Ezek.</hi> there be ſpeaking of new Moons &amp; other Feaſts, yet it
is to ſet out the condition and bleſſed eſtate of the times of the Goſpel under
thoſe ſhadows &amp; types, the Prophet ſpeaking according to the Jewiſh lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
in that way. This being granted, let us compare the inſtitution of the
Feaſt of the new Moon, In <hi>Num.</hi> 28. with what is laid in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 46. in <hi>Num.</hi>
28. they were <hi>to offer for a burnt offering two Bulloks, one Ramme, &amp; ſeven
Lambs,</hi> but in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 46. 6, In the daies of the new Moon there ſhould be but
<hi>one bullock &amp; ſix lambs.</hi> God himſelf had ſaid, that in their new Moons they
ſhould offer two Bullocks &amp; ſeven Lambs, yet when the Prophet would ſet
out a more glorious condition of the church, he ſaith, they ſhould not offer ſo
much as they did before, they ſhould offer but one Bullock and ſix Lambs.</p>
               <p>What are we taught from this? We are taught by this two excellent leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
which are the reaſon of the difference. Firſt, that there is ſuch a bleſſed
eſtate of the Goſpel coming, that ſhall not be ſubject to ſuch changes as hath
been heretofore, but a more ſetled condition of peace and reſt, ſo that they
ſhall not have ſuch occaſion to bleſſe God for his providence in the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of times as before they had. Their ſolemnity of the new Moon, that is,
of doing that ſpirituall thing that was done in a ceremonious way, that was
to give God the glory for the change of times: now in the times of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
they ſhall not have ſo many Sacrifices, to make it ſuch a ſolemn buſineſs
as it was then, Why? becauſe the Church ſhall be in another condition of
more reſt &amp; ſafety, and more conſtancy in their wayes, not hurried up and
down by mens humors, and luſts, and wills as before. Secondly, that the
ſtate of the Goſpel ſhall not be ſo ſubject to danger neither as it was before,
there ſhall not be that occaſion to bleſſe God for bringing of light preſently
after darkneſs, for that is one end of the Feaſt of the new Moon, that when
they could not ſee the Moone a great while, and it was darke, as if that crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
had been loſt out of Heaven, now they ſee it againe they were to bleſſe
God for it: But in the time of the Goſpel that is comming, there ſhall be
no ſuch darkneſſe, this time is not yet come, we yet had need to have our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
lambs and two bullocks for we have much darkneſs, thoſe places in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zek.</hi>
aime at ſome ſpeciall time more then other, there is a glorious time of
the ſtate of the Church, when there ſhall not be ſuch occaſion of bleſſing
God for delivering us from darkneſſe as there hath beene.</p>

and bravely, and merrily.</hi> Indeed the Sabbaths that many
keep have ſuch a derivation, their Sabbaths are ſabbaths of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> to be
merry, and to eate, and drinke, and play, is the end of all their Sabbaths.</p>
               <p>But the word hath a better root. God would have us upon the Sabbath
<hi>reſt</hi> from all other works, that we may be free to converſe with him: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is ſo much the more inexcuſable if when we have nothing elſe to doe
we ſhall deny to converſe with God as he requireth of us. If a friend ſhould
come to your houſe to converſe with you, and he ſhould know you have no
buſineſſe to take you up, yet you will ſcarce ſee him, or ſpend a little time
with him, will hee not take it ill? If indeed you could have ſuch an excuſe
that your buſineſſe is extraordinary, though your time be leſſe you ſpend
with him, it would not be ſo ill taken; but when he knows you have nothing
to do, and yet you deny time to converſe with him, will not this be taken for a
ſlighting him? Thus you deale with God; Had you indeed great occaſions
and buſineſſes to doe upon that day, though you did not ſo converſe with
God in holy duties, it were another matter; God might accept of mercy ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then ſacrifice. But when hee ſhall appoint you a day to reſt, wherein
you have nothing to doe but to converſe with him, yet then to deny it, this
is a ſleighting of the Majeſty of God.</p>
               <p>Now the Jews had diverſe Sabbaths, amongſt others theſe were prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
ones. The Sabbaths of dayes, and the Sabbaths of yeers.</p>
               <p>The Sabbath of dayes, every ſeventh day they had a Sabbath, and it was
kept unto the Lord. Now this Feaſt of theirs had ſo me what in it Memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
ſomewhat Significative, and ſomewhat Figurative. It was a Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,
a Signe,<note place="margin">Why a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath was ordained.</note> and a Figure. A Memoriall of two things.</p>
               <p>1. Of the works of Gods Creation. After God had finiſhed his works
of Creation, then he reſted, and ſanctified the ſeventh day, and <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 92.
being appointed for the Sabbath, the Argument of it is the celebrating the
Memoriall of Gods great works.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Of the deliverance out of Egypt, in remembrance of the reſt that God
did give them from their bondage. So you have it</hi> Deut, 5. 15. Remember
that thou waſt a ſervant in the land of Egypt, and that the Lord thy God
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:42662:152"/>
brought thee out thence, through a mighty hand, and by a ſtretched-out
arme: Therefore he commanded thee to keepe the Sabbath day.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it was Significative, a Signe, <hi>Exod, 31. 17. It is a ſigne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
me and the children of Iſrael for ever:</hi> And verſe 13. <hi>It is a ſigne
betweeue me &amp; you, that I an the Lord that doe ſanctifie you.</hi> God made
it a ſigne, that as this day was by his command to be ſanctified, ſet apart
from other dayes, ſo God had ſet apart this nation of the Jewes from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
nations.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It was Figurative, it did figure out or typific the reſt that did
remaine for the people of God, <hi>Heb. 4. There remaineth a reſt to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God,</hi> both here in the time of the Goſpel, and in heaven eternally.</p>
               <p>Now we are to know there was ſome ſpeciality in this day of reſt,<note place="margin">What ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall things in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day Sabbath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove other Sabbaths,</note> in this
ſabbath of the Jews more then in any other ſabbath. As,</p>
               <p>Firſt, in the Antiquity of it. It was the moſt ancient of all the dayes, ſet
apart for an holy uſe, being from the time of the Creation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it was written with Gods owne finger in the Tables.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, God rained no Manna upon this day, and that even before the
Law was given in Mount Sinai, for the honour of this day.</p>
               <p>4. The whole weeke doth take denomination from the Sabbath. <hi>Luke</hi>
18. 12. <hi>I faſt twice in the weeke,</hi> twice <hi>a Sabbath,</hi> ſo the words are in the
Greek. So <hi>Marke</hi> 16. 2. The firſt day <hi>of the weeke,</hi> the firſt <hi>of Sabbaths,</hi>
ſo the words.</p>
               <p>5. This Sabbath is called an everlaſting Covenant by way of eminency,
as if nothing of Gods Covenant were kept if this were not.<note place="margin">

               <p>This Sabbath <hi>the Jewes rejoyced much in, and bleſſed God for it, Nehem.</hi>
9. 14. as a great mercy. And <hi>Philo Iudaeus</hi> ſpeaking of the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
ſaith, It is a famous precept, and profitable to excite all kinde
of vertue and piety. And the Hebrews ſay we muſt ſanctifie the Sabbath
at the comming in and going out, and bleſſe God that hath given us this
Sabbath: Yea it is called by ſome of the Hebrews, <hi>the very deſire of dayes;</hi>
And <hi>Druſius</hi> telleth of a Jew, who when the Sabbath d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

It is not my worke to handle the point of the <hi>Sabbath-day,</hi> or <hi>Lords-day</hi>
now, but to open it as we have it here in the Text, to ſhew what kinde of
Sabbath the Jews had; onely obſerve this one thing about this Sabbath; If
you compare <hi>Numb.</hi> 28. 9. with <hi>Ezek.</hi> 46. 4. you ſhall finde that the offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
in the time of the Goſpel propheſied of, were more then thoſe were in
the time of the Law. In <hi>Numb.</hi> you finde but <hi>two Lambes,</hi> but in <hi>Ezekiel</hi>
you finde <hi>ſix Lambs and a Ram</hi> for the Sabbath: This by way of type
ſhewes, that in the ſetled times of the Goſpell, Gods worſhip upon the
Chriſtian Sabbath ſhould be ſolemnized more fully then it was in the time
of the Law.</p>
               <p>The next is the Sabbath of yeeres, and they were of two ſorts. There was
one to be kept every ſeven yeeres, and another every ſeven times ſeven, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
fiftieth yeere. Every ſeventh yeer there was a reſt of the land; as every
ſeventh day there was a reſt of the labour of their bodies, ſo every ſeventh
yeere there was a reſt of the land. <hi>Exod. 23, 10. Six yeeres thou ſhalt ſow
thy land and gather in the fruits thereof, but in the ſeventh yeere thou ſhalt
let it reſt analye ſtill,</hi> rhey muſt not prune their Vines, nor gather their vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
one yeere in ſeven.<note place="margin">The meaning of the reſt of the ſeventh yeere.</note> The Sabbath of dayes ſignified that they themſelves
were the Lords, therefore they ceaſt from their own labours: But the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
of yeeres, the reſting of the land ſignified that the land was the Lords,
at Gods diſpoſe, and that they were to depend upon the providence of God
for their food in the land; God would diſpoſe of the land, when they
ſhould plow, and when they ſhould ſow, and gather in the fruits thereof as
he pleaſed.</p>
               <p>We muſt acknowledge (that is the morall of it to our ſelves) that all lands
are the Lords, &amp; the fruit that we enjoy from the land it is at his diſpoſing.
If any man ſhould aske, what ſhould we eate that ſeventh yeere, ſeeing they
might not plow, nor ſow, nor reape, neither have vintage, nor harveſt? The
Lord anſwers them, <hi>Levit. 25. 20. 21. I will command my blesſing upon
thee in the ſixth yeere, and it ſhall bring forth fruit for three yeeres.</hi> God
you ſee will not have any to be loſers by his ſervice. Let us truſt God then,
though perhaps you have now one yeer in which you have no trading; Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
cry out, Oh this twelve-month we have had no trading in the City, we
can get no rent out of the Country neither. Do not murmure, truſt God; It
may be God hath beene beforehand with many of you, you have had full
trading formerly that may preſerve you comfortably now: If not before,
truſt God for the next; the Jews were faine to truſt God every ſeventh yeer,
they had nothing comming in for one yeere in ſeven. If once in all your
life time God take away your trading upon extraordinary occaſion, do not
murmure, do not give leſſe to the poore now; I ſpeak to thoſe whom God
hath bleſſed in former yeers, ſo as that they are not only able to ſubſiſt, but
to give too; See for this <hi>Deut, 5. 9. Beware thou ſayeſt not in thine heart
the ſeventh yeere is at hand, and thine eye be evill againſt thy poor bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and thou giveſt him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ought, and he cry unto the Lord againſt thee,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:42662:153"/>
and it be ſinne unto thee.</hi> If now becauſe you have not ſuch a full Income
as you were wont to have in your trading, if a company of poore diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
plundered people come among you and deſire your helpe, if you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
to relieve them, if they cry unto God againſt you, it will be ſin unto you.</p>
               <p>Now this reſt of the land was to put them in minde that there was a time
comming when God will free them from labour; Now they were faine to
eate their bread in the ſweat of their browes, but God would ſupply them
once in ſeven yeeres without the ſweat of their browes in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>illing the land,
ſhewing that there was a time where in God would bring his people to ſuch
a reſt that they ſhould have full ſupply of all things without labour.</p>
               <p>But further, beſides this there was a ſecond thing, in this ſeventh yeere all
debts that their brethren owed to them were to be releaſed. <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. 15. it
is called there, <hi>the Lords releaſe,</hi> the Lord is mercifull to thoſe that are in
debt. God knowes what a grievous burthen it is for his people to bee in
debt, it is indeed an inconceivable burthen; rich men who are full-handed
do not underſtand what a burthen it is for men to hang upon every buſh, to
be in debt to every man they deale with, they cannot ſleep quietly, they can
have but a little joy and comfort in their lives, the burthen is ſo grievous.</p>
               <p>Now God in mercy to his people that they might not all their dayes goe
under ſuch a burthen, and ſo have little joy of their lives, therefore he gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
this favour to them, that once in ſeven yeeres their debts were to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed:
But it was the debt of an <hi>Hebrew, Deut.</hi> 15. 30. Forraigners
debts they were not bound to releaſe: By that wee are to learne this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
that there ſhould be more pity and commiſeration ſhewen to
thoſe that are our brethren in the fleſh, or our brethren in regard of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and godlineſſe, in regard of their debts then others.</p>
               <p>It is true, there is a complaint of many that are godly, that they have lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
care and conſcience in paying their debts: the juſtneſſe of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
I know not, but there may be a ſlothfulneſſe in many, if not unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe,
and if there be careleſneſſe &amp; unfaithfulneſſe in ſome, it is enough
to caſt an aſperſion upon all that are godly: but though thoſe that are god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſhould be more carefull of paying their debts then others,<note place="margin">Mercy to the poore in regard of their debts.</note> but if they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
you are bound to be more mercifull unto them then to others, becauſe
they are godly, and not to ſeeke to take advantage the rather upon them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are godly, this is a vile and a wicked heart, to take advantage ſo
much the rather, if thou ſeeſt them godly &amp; laborious in their calling, and it
be meerely a providence of God, and not any negligence of theirs, thou art
bound to ſhew much commiſeration unto them. In that forenamed place,
<hi>Deut. 15. 9. Beware there be not an evill heart in thee, to be leſſe merciful
to thy poore brother becauſe of the ſeventh yeeres reſt of the ground, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the debt was to be releaſed that ſeventh yeere, but</hi> (verſe 10.) <hi>thou
ſhalt ſurely give it him, and thy heart ſhall not be grieved, becauſe for this
thing the Lord thy God ſhall bleſſe thee in all thy workes, and in all that
thou put teſt thy hand unto.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="304" facs="tcp:42662:154"/>
Notwithſtanding there muſt be a ceſſation of plowing, and ſowing, and
vintage in the ſeventh yeer, yea and notwithſtanding thou wert bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe
thy debt in the ſeventh yeer, yet you muſt doe this, and not do it grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,
you muſt not murmure and ſay, what doth God require of us that
we muſt neither plow uor ſow, and that we muſt releaſe our debts and give
too, nay and give, and not have our hearts grieved too, that we muſt not
complaine of this? Oh my brethren, God loveth exceedingly cheerfull gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
and hearts inlarged with bowels of compaſſion, he doth no: love hearts
grumbling and objecting againſt giving. Many men have no quickneſſe of
underſtanding in any thing elſe but againſt workes of mercy, how quick are
they in their objections, and can finde ſuch ſubtle wayes to ſave their purſes
that a man would wonder at it, againſt this there is a ſolemne charge, <hi>Deut.</hi>

needy in the land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third thing to be done once in ſeven yeers was the releaſe of ſervants
too, they muſt goe free, and they muſt not be ſent away empty neither, as ver.
18. of that <hi>Deut. 15. It ſhall not ſeeme hard to thee when thou ſendeſt him
away free from thee,</hi> you muſt give them <hi>liberty,</hi> as ver. 14.</p>
               <p>It is true, we are not bound to the letter of this, every ſeven yeers to doe
thus, but there is a morall equity in it, when ſervants have done you faithfull
ſervice, you muſt not think that it is enough that you give them meate and
drink, and cloth, but you muſt be carefull of your ſervants how they ſhould
live after they are gone from you.<note place="margin">Iubilee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened.</note> This was the firſt ſabbath of yeers.</p>
               <p>But the ſecond was moſt famous, and that was the reſt that was every ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

and then he ſhould have reſt. Here it is to be underſtood of the 50. yeer, the
yeer of Jubile.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="305" facs="tcp:42662:154"/>
There are ſome kind of ſpirits that are ſo ſlaviſh that when they may have
liberty they will not, they deſerve to have their eares bored, to be ſlaves to
the fiftieth year, if not for ever. Many amongſt us this day have ſuch ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.
<hi>God</hi> offereth us a releaſe from bondage, how many of us love ſervitude
ſtill! It is juſt with <hi>God</hi> that we ſhould have our eares bored, and that we
ſhould be ſlaves even for ever, but we hope there will be a Iubile come at
length for our deliverance, God would have a Iubile even to deliver thoſe
that were of the moſt ſervile ſpirits, and might juſtly be left to ſerve for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
It is true, when God began with us in the beginning of our Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
like the ſeventh year God offered to us a releaſe, and we refuſed it
then, and ſince we deſerve that our ears ſhould be bored; but God is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
mercifull, though we be of ſervile ſpirits, and know not how to pitty
our ſelves, we hope the Lord will pity us, and grant us out of free and rich
grace a <hi>Iubile,</hi> even to deliver thoſe who have a mind to be bond-ſlaves; I
am ſure God doth ſo ſpiritually. If God ſhould not deliver thoſe that are
minded to be ſlaves, he ſhould deliver none.</p>
               <p>It was a great mercy ſo to provide for ſervants, that they might be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.
The greater, becauſe ſervants then were not as they are now, there
was a great deal of hardſhip that ſervants indured then more then now, they
were bought and ſold, not only other nations, but the <hi>Hebrews</hi> were bought
for ſervants alſo, ſo you ſhall find it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 2. Beſides, ſervants were
in ſuch bondage then, as if the Maſters did beat them with a rod untill they
killed them,<note place="margin">The hard condition of ſervants in former times.</note> yet they muſt only be puniſhed, they muſt not have blood go
for their blood, yea though he died under his hand, yet he was but to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
and if the ſervant lived but 2. or 3. days after, the <hi>Maſter</hi> was not
to be puniſhed at all, ſo you have it, <hi>Exod. 21. 20, 21. If a man ſmite his
ſervant with a rod, and he dye under his hand, he ſhall be ſurely puniſhed,
notwithſtanding if he continue a day or two, he ſhall not be puniſhed, for he
is his money.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Oh that <hi>ſervants</hi> would conſider of this, and bleſs God for the liberty they
have now more then <hi>ſervants</hi> had in former times! It was ſo likewiſe with
the Romans, the word [<hi>ſervant</hi>] cometh <hi>à Servando,</hi> becauſe the Romans
uſed to have ſuch for <hi>ſervants</hi> as were preſerved in time of war, that ſhould
otherwiſe have bin put to death, whether they were thoſe or others, yet the
condition of all was very ſervile both amongſt Iews and Romans, which
may juſtly rebuke the pride of ſervants now, if they be but croſt in their
minds in the leaſt thing, they make ſuch a complaint as if they were exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
wronged. Let ſervants rather bleſs God for their condition, then mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur
at a little hardſhip they indure, for the hardſhip of ſervants in former
times was another manner of hardſhip then any you can indure who have
the hardeſt maſters. Hence it is that in the day of <hi>Iubile</hi> the ſervants did ſo
rejoyce; Iewiſh antiquities tell us that nine days before their releaſe, the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
feaſted and made merry, and wore garlands, becauſe of their freedom
approaching.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="306" facs="tcp:42662:155"/>
The ſecond thing extraordinary in the day of Jubile, was, that not onely
debts,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>God win</hi> Iewish an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiq lib. 3. c. 10.</note> but lands were releaſed. <hi>Lev. 25. 22. The land ſhall not be ſold for
ever.</hi> And there were divers reaſons for this, why the land muſt not be ſold
for ever, but muſt return to the firſt poſſeſſors in the year of Jubile.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> One reaſon is in the Text,<note place="margin">Reaſons why land muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn in the yeare of Iubile.</note> 
                  <hi>Lev. 25. 23. For the land is mine,</hi> ſaith God,
<hi>for yee were ſtrangers and ſojourners with me:</hi> God would hereby teach
them that they muſt not account themſelves abſolute lords of the land, <hi>the
land is mine;</hi> and you that are the greateſt land-lords of all are but as <hi>ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
and ſojourners with God,</hi> the land is ſtill Gods. And <hi>verſ. 28. If a
man bee not able to redeeme his land,</hi> nor his kinſman for him, <hi>it ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
unto the yeer of Iubile, and in the Iubile it ſhall goe out, and hee ſhall
return unto his poſſeſſion.</hi> If he could redeem his land himſelf or a kinſman
for him, he was to redeeme it before; but if a man ſhould be ſo poor as he
could not give any thing to redeem it, yet in the year of Iubile it ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
unto him.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> God would not have his people too greedy to bring the poſſeſſion
of the Countrey in to themſelves, to have a perpetuall inheritance to
themſelves and their poſterity. This is the greedineſs of many covetous and
ambitious men, oh that we could lay land to land, and houſe to houſe, to get
a perpetuall inheritance for our ſelves and poſterity! God would not have
his people be of ſo greedy diſpoſitions, for a few of them to get the whole
Countrey into their own poſſeſſion, therefore he would have no man that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
had any poſſeſſion, but once in fifty years that poſſeſſion muſt return to
that familie again.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The land was to return to the firſt owner, that the diſtinction of Tribes
might be continued, which was known much by the continuance of their
poſſeſſions that belonged to every tribe &amp; family. God had great care be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Chriſts time to keep the diſtinction of tribes, that ſo it might be cleare
out of which tribe Chriſt came.</p>
               <p>But further, this year of Iubile aymed at a higher thing, it was a type of
Chriſt, to ſet out the bleſſed redemption that we have by Chriſt. The trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
of the Goſpel which the Miniſters blow is a trumpet of Iubile. That
place <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61. 1, 2. ſeems to have reference to a Iubile, there the Text ſaith,
that Chriſt was appointed <hi>to proclaim liberty to the captives, &amp; the opening
of the priſon to them that are bound, to proclaim the acceptable yeer of the
Lord;</hi> now that acceptable year was the year of Iubile, there was the opening
of the priſon, and the releaſing of them that were bound. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 15. ſaith
the text, <hi>Bleſſed are the people that heare the joyfull ſound,</hi> that hear the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile.
Oh bleſſed are our ears who live to ſuch a time as we do, to heare the
trumpet of Iubile blowing in one congregation or other almoſt every day!
now we have a releaſe of our debts &amp; bondage, this is the joyfull ſound. We
are all by nature in debt (ſins you know are called debts in the Lords pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er)
every ſoul is bound over to Gods eternall juſtice to anſwer to the law, for
not obeying the law; now cometh this Iubile and releaſeth all debts. And we
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:42662:155"/>
are all bond-ſlaves, in bondage to ſin, to the law, and to the devil, now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Goſpel, this Iubile, and releaſeth our bondage, ſets us at liberty. 3.
We have forfeited our right to the crea ure, yea to heaven it ſelf; now the
Goſpel comes and reſtores all, we have right now to the comforts of this
world, and to heaven. <hi>Canaan</hi> was a type of heaven, and the loſs of their
inheritance, there was a type of the loſs of heaven, and the bringing them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
to the poſſeſſion of it, a type of the reſtoring of right to heaven; Oh hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
are they then who hear this joyfull ſound, not only with the eares of the
body, but who have it ſounding in their hearts, and that by the work of the
ſpirit of God in them.</p>
               <p>In this year of Iubile there is one thing further very remarkable, and that is
the time when this trumpet that was to proclaim this yeer was to blow, <hi>Lev.</hi>
25. 9. the trumpet was to blow upon <hi>the tenth day of the ſeventh moneth.</hi>
What remarkable thing is there in this, that the trumpet muſt be blown the
tenth day of the ſeventh month? yes, there is this remarkable in it, the tenth
day of the ſeventh month was their day of expiation (the day of their atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
their publique faſt) This day appointed every year for all Iſrael to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
their ſouls before God,<note place="margin">The trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet of Iubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le to blow on their faſting days and way.</note> to humble themſelves for their ſins, and to ſeek
for mercy from God (as we ſhal ſhew you more largely when we come to
open the ſolemnity of that day) I only mention it now to ſhew that the
trumpet of Iubile was to be ſounded upon that day. It is a ſtrange thing that
upon that day wherein they were to afflict their ſoules before God, and to
mourn for their ſins, the trumpet of Iubile was to ſound, that was to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
joy and mirth, things of a contrary nature to humbling and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Yea but this affords us divers excellent inſtructions. As</p>
               <p>Firſt, God would have his people ſo to mourn as to know their joy is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
In the darkeſt day they had, wherein they were bound to afflict their
ſouls moſt, yet they were ſo to mourn, as to know there was a Iubile at
hand. We are not to mourn as thoſe without hope: in our moſt grievous &amp;
ſoreſt mournings we muſt have our hearts ſink in deſperation, wee muſt
ſo mourne as to expect a Iubile. Yea further, the Saints mourning <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
is a preparation to a Iubile o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> joy. Ioy then is neer at hand when the Saints
muſt mourn in a godly manner. Did not the Lord deal graciouſly with us
the laſt faſt day when we were mourning before him? There was amongſt
our brethren in other parts a kind of trumpet of Iubile blown; the Lord was
then working for us; what great deliverance did God grant that very day at
<hi>Chicheſter?</hi> God ſhews that the mourning of his people doth make way for
joy. Yea further, then indeed is the ſound of the trumpet of <hi>Iubile</hi> ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
when we are moſt afflicted for our ſins. When we are moſt apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
and ſenſible of the evill of ſin, then the joy of God, the comforts of the
Goſpel are ſweeteſt to the ſoul. When the <hi>trumpet</hi> of <hi>Iubile</hi> is blown in
congregations, if it meets not with hearts afflicted ſenſible of ſinne, they are
not delighted with the ſweet ſound of this <hi>trumpet,</hi> it is not melody in their
ears, it rejoy ceth not their hearts: But let a poore ſoul be brought down
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:42662:156"/>
and made ſenſible of the evill of ſinne, and Gods wrath, then let but one
promiſe of the Goſpel be ſounded forth, how ſweet, how joyfull is it!</p>
               <p>Again, pardon of ſin is the only foundation of all Jubiles. For this tenth
day of the ſeventh month, wherein the trumpet of Jubile was to be ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
was <hi>a day of Atonement.</hi> What is that? <hi>A day of covering</hi> (for ſo the
word is) of pardon of ſin to the people of God. Many men keep a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Jubile, live merrily and bravely, doe nothing but eate, and drink, and
play, and dance, and laugh, and cannot endure theſe fadde melancholy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
What is the foundation of this thy Jubile? Art thou ſure there is an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement
made between God and thy ſoule? Art thou ſure thy ſin is pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned?
Is this the foundation of thy rejoycing? Know it will not laſt, it is not
Gods, but the Devils Jubile, except there be an atonement made between
God and thee as the foundation of it.</p>
               <p>Yet further, in that the ſound of the Jubile was at that time when the day
of Atonement was. Note this,</p>
               <p>When God hath pardoned us, then our hearts are in a fit frame to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
others. Now comes the Jubile, and now you muſt releaſe your lands,
your debts, and forgive thoſe that owe you any thing. This is the day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
God teſtifieth his mercy in pardoning your ſinnes, and they might well
ſay, Now Lord command us what thou wilt in ſhewing mercy to our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
we are ready to pardon, to releaſe them, to extend the bowels of our
compaſſion towards them, for thou haſt pardoned our ſins. The reaſon of
the rigidneſſe, of the cruelty, the hardneſs of the hearts of men, and ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of their ſpirits to their brethren, is this, becauſe God hath not witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to their ſouls the pardon of their own ſinns, an atonement between God
and them.</p>
               <p>Their ſolemn feaſts.</p>
               <p>Among their feaſts, they had three that were eſpecially very ſolemn feaſts
more then others: And they were
<list>
                     <item>The Feaſt of
<list>
                           <item>The Paſſeover.</item>
                           <item>Pentecoſt.</item>
                           <item>Tabernacles.</item>
                        </list>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe three were very ſolemn, eſpecially in this one regard, wherein they
are all three united in one thing, that is, upon theſe three Feaſts all the Males
were to aſcend up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to worſhip, to the place which God did
chooſe, and ſo you have it, <hi>Deut. 16. 16. Three times in a yeere ſhall all
thy males appear before the Lord thy God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">What to be learned from that law, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Iews to go thrice a yeer to the place that God choſe.</note> 
                  <hi>in the place which he ſhal chooſe
in the feaſt of unleavened bread,</hi> (that was the <hi>Paſſeover) and in the feaſt
weeks,</hi> (that was <hi>Pentecoſt) and in the feaſt of Tabernacles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But how could the ten Tribes then keep theſe Feaſts? for they went not
to the Temple.</p>
               <p>You may as well ſay, how had they an Ephod? of which <hi>Chap. 3. Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi>
was wiſe enough to keep the feaſts, though not in that way God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
he could tell them the going to the Temple was but circumſtance of
place.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="309" facs="tcp:42662:156"/>
From this connection of theſe three together in this ſolemnity, upon
which theſe three were eſpecially called their ſolemn feaſts, there are divers
things to be noted.</p>
               <p>Firſt, we may ſee a reaſon why there were ſometimes ſo many beleevers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
at <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> An argument is brought by ſome from that place, <hi>Acts</hi> 21.
20. to prove that there may be in one Church more then can poſſibly aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
together in one Congregation, for the Text ſaith there, <hi>Thou ſeeſt how
many thouſands of Iews there are which beleeve,</hi> how many <hi>millions</hi> it is
in the Originall; now ſay they, there could not be ſo many millions to joyn
in one Congregation: The anſwer to this is cleare, that the time of which
this place ſpeaketh, was when the people of the Jews were all aſſembled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to keep the feaſt of Pentecoſt, for <hi>Chap. 20. verſ.</hi> 16.
the Text ſaith, that the Apoſtle <hi>haſtned, if it were poſſible for him to be at
Ieruſalem the day of Pentecoſt;</hi> now reading the ſtory on, it plainely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
that in that journey in which he did ſo haſten, he did get to <hi>Ieruſalem</hi>
at the day of Pentecoſt, and being there at that time, no marvail that they
ſaid, <hi>Doſt thou not ſee how many thouſands of Iews there are that beleeve?</hi>
For all the males of the people of the Iewes were got together at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi>
according to the inſtitution, ſo that they were there by reaſon of that Law
that as yet they ſubmitted to, they were not in a Church ſtate at <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
therefore there is no ſtrength in that objection againſt congregationall
Churches.</p>
               <p>Secondly, where there is a nationall Church, there muſt be an uniting of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
them in ſome way of Nationall worſhip. There is this Nationall worſhip
that the Iews by inſtitution from God were united in, three times in a yeare
to go up to the Temple to worſhip: And except there ſhonld be ſome ſuch
kind of individuall worſhip, not in the ſame ſpecies, that is, as others are
praying, ſo are we, and as others are hearing, ſo are we, for ſo all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
in the world may be joyned, but to joyne in one act of worſhip toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as that was of going up to the Temple, there muſt be ſuch a thing.
And that made the Iews a Nationall Church, becauſe we have no ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
now, no Nation in the world can in a proper ſenſe be ſaid to be a
Nationall Church as theirs was; in ſome figurative ſenſe we may ſo call it,
but not in that proper ſenſe as it was among the Iews.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, there are ſome Ordinances that cannot be enjoyed but in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
way of Church-fellowſhip. The Iews could not enjoy theſe feaſts as they
ought (indeed it may be Iſrael, the ten Tribes would make a kind of patch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up feaſt, but they could not feaſt ſo as they ought) unleſſe they went to
Ieruſalem in that way God appointed. As among the Iews, there were ſome
Ordinances they might enjoy in their Synagogues and private houſes, but
ſome which they could not enjoy but in the Temple; ſo there are ſome Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
we may enjoy in our families, but others wee cannot enjoy but in
Church-communion, which Ieruſalem is a type of. A fourth thing obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable
is, theſe three times wherein they were to go up to Ieruſalem, were all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
in the Summer time, not in the Winter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="310" facs="tcp:42662:157"/>
For the firſt, which was the Feaſt of the Paſſeover, was in the latter end
of our March, and the beginning of April; the Feaſt of Pentecoſt was fifty
dayes after, the Feaſt of Tabernacles was about the middle of our Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
It was indeed a very laborious thing for them to goe up to Ieruſalem
to worſhip, but God did ſo commiſerate and pitty them, that they were not
to goe in the winter time. That is the reaſon of that phraſe in <hi>Acts.</hi> 27. 9.
<hi>Sayling was dangerous, becauſe the Feaſt was already paſt,</hi> that is, the
Feaſt of Tabernacles was paſt, which was about the fifteenth of Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and ſo it began to be winter. God would be ſo indulgent to his people
that they ſhould have the Summer time to go up to Jeruſalem in. If it would
be an affliction to goe up to Jeruſalem in the winter, and therefore God
would favour his people in that; Oh what an affliction is it then to flie from
Jeruſalem before our enemies in the winter time? We had need pray the
more hard now for thoſe that are in danger of the enemy, that God would
be mercifull to them in this.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> A fifth note is when they did goe up to theſe three Feaſts, they muſt not
come empty, but full-handed, ſo you have it, <hi>Deut. 16. 16. Ye ſhall not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
before the Lord empty;</hi> Noting thus much, That when ever we come
to acknowledge Gods mercy for any thing, we muſt come with full hands,
and liberall hearts, with hearts ready to diſtribute, or otherwiſe we doe but
take Gods Name in vaine.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> The laſt is, the wonderfull providence of God toward them, though all
the males in the whole Countrey were to come up to Jeruſalem three times
in the yeere, yet their Countrey ſhould not be in danger of the enemies: For
the Jews had not ſuch walls of Seas about their Country as we have, but they
lived in the very midſt of their enemies, they were ſurrounded with them, on
the Eaſt the <hi>An<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>onites</hi> and <hi>Moabites;</hi> the Weſt, the <hi>Phyliſtims;</hi> the South,
the <hi>Egyptians. Idumeans;</hi> the North, the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> to whom the Prophet
ſeemes to have reference, <hi>Zach.</hi> 1, 18. Now they might ſay, ſhall our males
goe up to Jeruſalem three times a yeer, why then our enemies that lie cloſe
in our borders, (for they lay as neere them as Yorke, or any other ſhire is to
us) may come upon us and deſtroy us; therefore God laid in a caveat
and proviſion for the incouragement of them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 24. he tells them
there, <hi>None ſhall deſire thy land when thou ſhalt goe up to appeare before
the Lord thy God thrice in thee yeere;</hi> God tooke care that none ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
their land.</p>
               <p>Let us goe on in Gods ſervice, and hee will take care to deliver us from
our enemies. Many times out of ſlaviſh feare of the danger of enemies,
and what diſturbance they are able to make amongſt us, wee are ready to
betray the cauſe of God, and neglect his worſhip. Let us learne from hence
to goe on in Gods wayes, and not feare any hurt our enemies can doe us,
God ſaith that he will take care when they are all at Jeruſalem in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes
of his worſhip that none ſhould deſire their land.</p>
               <p>Now for the opening theſe ſeverall Feaſts, in it you may be helped
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:42662:157"/>
fruitfully to reade much Scripture in the Old Teſtament, for much of it is
ſpent in things concerning ſome of theſe.</p>
               <p>The firſt was the Paſſeover.<note place="margin">The Feaſt of Paſſeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</note> You have the hiſtory of it <hi>Numb.</hi> 28. 16.
17. and in divers other Scriptures: That Feaſt was in the beginning of the
yeere. It is true, our Scripture was the beginning of their <hi>Annus Civilis</hi>
their yeere for Civill affairs, but the Month <hi>Abib,</hi> which was the middle of
March, and part of Aprill, was <hi>Annus Eccleſiaſticus,</hi> the Eccleſiaſticall
yeere, and it was ſo appointed, upon their deliverance out of Egypt when
God commanded them then to celebrate their Paſſe-over, hee told them
that that Month ſhould be unto them the beginning of monthes, the firſt
month of the yeere.</p>
               <p>Noting thus much, That deliverance from great evills are mercies that we
are highly to prize; the Jews were to begin their yeere in memoriall of the
mercy they had upon that Month.</p>
               <p>For the name [<hi>Paſſeover</hi>] from God ſending forth deſtroying Angels
that yet <hi>paſſed over</hi> the houſes of the Iſraelites that night; he went thorough
the land and deſtroyed all the firſt borne of the Egyptians, but ſaved the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites,
this Feaſt was alſo called <hi>the Feaſt of unleavened bread, Luc.</hi> 22.
1. becauſe they were to goe out of Egypt in haſt, and could not have time
to leaven their bread, but tooke only a little flower and water together, and ſo
carryed it upon their backs; <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells us that they tooke onely a little
flower with water together that might ſerve them with a great deale of ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
but for thirty dayes, there was all they had for ſo many thouſand thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
onely for ſo many dayes, God put them to it, to depend upon him.</p>
               <p>We are ready to murmure if we ſee not enough to ſerve us many yeers, if
our armies have not enough for ſo long time: they had but a little meale and
water that might ſerve them for thirty dayes, and they knew not where to
have more when that was ſpent; no marvaile that it is ſaid of <hi>Moſes, Heb.</hi>
11. 27. <hi>by faith we went out of Egypt.</hi> This bread is called <hi>the bread of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
Deut.</hi> 16. 3. and it was <hi>unleavened</hi> bread, not onely to typifie that
we muſt not have our hearts leavened with malice, but to put them in mind
of that ſore affliction they were in, not onely when they were in Egypt, but
when they went out of Egypt, that they had then but a little meale and water
to ſerve them for thirty dayes.</p>
               <p>Now this Paſſeover was partly Memorative, and partly Figurative.</p>
               <p>Memorative, Firſt to remember the deliverance of their firſt borne.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to remember their deliverance from the bondage of Egypt.</p>
               <p>When others are ſmitten (that is the morall ſignification) and we paſſe
over,<note place="margin">Obſ. 1.</note> this is a great mercy.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>

God is pleaſed now to offer us this mercy of deliverance from both
theſe bondages, certainly we are a people devoted to miſery if we ſhall not
take Gods offer of mercy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="312" facs="tcp:42662:158"/>
We have beene in bondage in our eſtates and liberties, God offereth us
freedome, and freedome alſo from Antichriſtian bondage which is worſe
then Egyptian bondage. The Text ſaith when they were delivered from
the bondage of Egypt <hi>Moſes ſang,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Apoc. 15. 1</note> and in the <hi>Revelation</hi> when they were
delivered from Antichriſtian bondage <hi>they ſang the ſong of Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We were long ſince delivered from a great part of this bondage, now the
Lord oſtereth to deliver us altogether.<note place="margin">Obſ. 1.</note> But to let that goe.</p>
               <p>They were to eate this Paſſeover with their ſtaves in their hands,<note place="margin">When God offereth deliverance we should not bee ſluggish.</note> this was to
note their haſty going out of Egypt. We ſhould not when God offereth us
mercy of deliverance, goe forth ſlowly. This is our miſery at this day, the
Lord offereth deliverance and we lye ſlugging on our beds, and are like that
fooliſh <hi>child</hi> the Prophet ſpeakes of that <hi>ſticks in the birth:</hi> We have ſtuck
theſe two yeers in the birth, whereas we might have beene delivered long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this. It concerns us all to conſider what the cauſe is, and to lament it
before the Lord that we may make our peace with him.</p>
               <p>But further.<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> In thankſgiving for a mercy we are ever to remember what
we were before that mercy. They muſt eate unleavened bread at this Feaſt,
the bread of affliction, they muſt remember the afflictions they were in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they had this mercy, whereof this Feaſt was a Memoriall; when wee
bleſſe God for a deliverance, we muſt really preſent before our ſouls the ſad
condition we were in before we were delivered.</p>
               <p>Further, The ſpeciall thing that is aimed at in the Paſſeover, was that it
ſhould be a type of Chriſt, who was that paſchall lamb that was to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the ſinnes of the world, he that was roſted in the fire of Gods wrath for
our ſinnes, as that Lambe that was to be eaten in the Paſſe-over was ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
in the fire: And if ever the Angell of Gods vengeance do paſſe over us,
it is thorough the blood of that Lambe ſprinkled upon our hearts, which
was ſignified by the ſprinkling the blood of the Lambe upon the poſts of
their houſes. In the Lords Supper we celebrate in effect the ſame Feaſt
of the Paſſe-over they did: and by this we may learne this excellent note.</p>
               <p>There is little comfort in the remembrance of outward deliverances,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note>
except we can ſee them all in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>They were in this Feaſt to remember their deliverance out of Egypt,<note place="margin">Deliveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces looked upon in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to Chriſt are ſweet.</note> but
withall they were in it to have a figure and type of Chriſt, that ſweetned
their remembrance that made the Feaſt a joyfull Feaſt, when they could
ſee their deliverance out of Egypt as a fruit of Chriſts ſufferings, when this
Lambe that was to put them in minde of it, did put them in minde like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
of Chriſt the paſchal Lambe.</p>
               <p>In all deliverances from any kinde of affliction, if you would have the
remembrance of them ſweet unto you, you muſt looke upon them all in the
blood of Chriſt, and ſo remember them, and then your hearts will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged
to bleſſe God.<note place="margin">The Iewish additions to their Paſs-over.</note>
               </p>
               <p>This was the Ordinance of God in the Paſſe-over, but beſides Gods Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance,
the Jews added divers other things.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="313" facs="tcp:42662:158"/>
The firſt thing obſervable that they added, was earneſt prayer to God for
the building of the Temple; which many of them obſerve to this day. Thoſe
who writ of the cuſtomes of the Jews tell us, that becauſe the Temple is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
where they were to goe up thrice in the yeere to ſolemnize theſe
Feaſts, therefore they pray ſo earneſtly and mightily for the Temple in
this manner: They cry altogether to God, <hi>Lord, build thy temple ſhortly,
very quickly, very quickly, moſt quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in our dayes:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Templum tuum brevi, valde cito, valde cito, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ebus noſtris, citisſime, nunc aedifica templum tuum brevi.

again, <hi>Mercifull God, great God, kind
God, high God, ſweet God,</hi> with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
other epithets, <hi>Now build thy
Temple quickly, very quickly, &amp;c.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o <hi>Euxtorfius</hi> tells us. They teach us
how much the Temple doth concern
us. Here is onely their miſtake, they
reſted in the materiall Temple, they
did not conſider that This Temple was a type of Chriſt, therefore as earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtly
as they prayed for the building of their materiall Temple, ſo we are
to pray for the building up of the myſticall body of Chriſt, now Lord, build
quickly, doe not defer it, even in our dayes do it.</p>
               <p>A ſecond thing they added was the manner of caſting out of unleavened
bread, in this they obſerved three things, their inquiſition, their extermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
their execration, firſt with a candle they would narrowly ſearch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
corner of the houſe, to ſee if they had the leaſt crumme of leaven, if any
were found they caſt it out with ſolemnity, and then they uſed to wiſh a
curſe upon themſelves if there were any left in their houſes that was not
caſt out.</p>
               <p>This morall Obſervation wee may be taught from it, it ſhould be our
care when we are to receive the Sacrament, to make narrow inquiſition, to
get the candle of the word, and to ſearch every corner of our hearts, every
faculty of the ſoule, to ſee if there be no leaven in it. 2. Whatſover we ſee to
caſt it out of doores. And 3. to be ſo much ſet againſt ſinne, as to be willing
to take a curſe upon our ſelves, if we ſhould willingly let any knowne ſin be
in our hearts, and to acknowledge that God might juſtly curſe us in his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance,
if we be falſe in this.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they uſed to ſhew forth all their brave rich things, if they had any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
bravery in cloathes, in furniture, in any good thing, they would ſhew all at
this Feaſt. By their ſuperſtition we may learne this note, that in the time of
our comming before God, it is fit for us to manifeſt his graces, to exerciſe all
thoſe beautifull graces that the Lord hath endowed us with by the work of his
Spirit, for there is the riches of a Chriſtian, there is his brave cloathes, and
his plate, all his excellencies are his graces.</p>
               <p>The fourth thing they did was, after the Paſſe-over was at an end, they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
                  <pb n="314" facs="tcp:42662:159"/>
would faſt three dayes, to humble themſelves for their faylings in keeping
that Feaſt. This was not Gods Inſtitution, but it was their cuſtome, and
we may learne this from it, (though not to binde our ſelves to that they did)
too looke back to our receiving the Sacrament, and to bewayle all our miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages;
I beleeve if things were examined to the quick in our receiving
the Sacrament, you would finde matter enough to faſt and pray for the
humbling your ſoules from your miſcarriages.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Laſtly, in the Paſſe-over they uſed to reade the book of the Canticles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that booke treats eſpecially of the conjunction of the ſoule with the
Meſſiah, which is ſealed up eſpecially in the Paſſe-over. And that indeed is
a ſpeciall meditation for us when we come to the Lords Supper, to meditate
of our conjunction with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The next is the Feaſt of Pentecoſt.<note place="margin">The Feaſt of Pante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſt.</note> This Feaſt is called alſo <hi>the Feaſt of
Weekes,</hi> becauſe there were ſeven weekes to be reckoned, and then at the
end of them it was ſolemnly to be kept, you ſhall finde it, <hi>Levit.</hi> 23. 15.
There you have the Feaſt of the Paſſe-over, and in that the firſt day of ſeven,
and the laſt day of ſeven was ſolemnly kept; now they were to count from
the morrow after the firſt Sabbath, ſeven Sabbaths, that is, ſeven weekes
compleate; the firſt Sabbath of the Paſſe-over was the fifteenth day of the
month <hi>Abib,</hi> and then the next day from that they were to count ſeven
weeks, and at the end of ſeven weeks was the Feaſt of Pentecoſt to be kept.
Now in this firſt day wherein they began to count their weeks (for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
to this Feaſt of Pentecoſt) you ſhall find that the firſt fruits were to
be offered up to God, it was a kinde of diſtinct Feaſt, called <hi>the Eaſt of the
Firſt-fruits,</hi> in which they were to bring a ſheafe of the firſt fruits of their
harveſt unto the Prieſt to be offered to God; And the reaſon was, becauſe
new their harveſt began: Aſſoone as ever the Paſſe-over was killed, and
they had kept the firſt Sabbath of the Paſſe-over (for they were to keepe it
ſeven dayes) they began their harveſt, they muſt not put a Sickle into the
corne, nor reape any thing of their ground untill they had kept the Paſſe-o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
it affordeth auto us this inſtruction. We cannot enjoy any ſweetneſſe
nor any bleſſing from any fruits of the earth,<note place="margin">No bleſsing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed from the earth but through Chriſt.</note> but through the blood of Jeſus
Chriſt: After they had ſolemnized the memorial of the blood of Chriſt, then
they might put a Sickle into the corne &amp; reape it, and not before, &amp; as ſoone
as they had ſolemnized the remembrance of Chriſt in the Paſſe-over, they
might goe with comfort and take the fruits of the earth &amp; rejoyce in them,
but not before. Now this was in the month of <hi>Abib,</hi> that is part of our
March, &amp; part of April, then began their harveſt, &amp; thence it hath its name,
for <hi>Abib</hi> ſignifies <hi>an eare of corne.</hi> Now their harveſt began ſo ſoone in
the land of Canaan, not only becauſe it was a hot Country, for it is obſerved
that Africa was a hotter Country then theirs, and yet their harveſt began not
ſo ſoone;<note place="margin">Heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantiae.</note> but becauſe of the bleſſing of God upon that land, therefore <hi>Ier.</hi> 3.
19. it is called <hi>a goodly heritage,</hi> becauſe of the timely bringing forth the
fruit; the words tranſlated <hi>goodly heritage,</hi> ſignifies <hi>an heritage of comli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;</hi>
                  <pb n="315" facs="tcp:42662:159"/>
the ſame word that is here for <hi>goodly,</hi> ſignifies a <hi>Roe-Buck,</hi> to which
this land was compared, and ſo it may be ſaid to be a land of a Roe-Buck,
becauſe of the ſpeedy and ſwift ripening of the corne.<note place="margin">Obſ. 1.</note> The obſervation is,
It is the bleſſing of the Church to have their fruit ripe betimes,<note place="margin">Timely fruit is pleaſing to God.</note> not to ſtay too
long before they be ripe, for Canaan was a type of the Church. You young
ones conſider of this; the Lord loveth to have the fruits of Canaan ripe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times;
if you grew in the wilderneſſe, though you did not bring forth fruit
in your young time, God did not ſo much regard it; but if you live in his
Church, in Canaan, the Lord expects you ſhould beg in betimes, in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſpring of your yeeres you ſhould bring forth fruit un to God. Men doe
much rejoyce in timely fruits, they are lovely: Yea and God rejoyceth in
them too, <hi>Micah. 7. 1. My ſoul deſireth the firſt ripe fruits,</hi> this is true of
God himſelfe. Your parents and Godly friends may ſay, our ſoule deſires
that grace may ſpring up betimes in theſe young ones, ſo it may be ſaid of
God, the very ſoul of God deſireth to ſee the firſt fruits; fruit in young ones
is that which is pleaſing to Gods ſoule.</p>
               <p>We may further note,<note place="margin">Obſer</note> when we have had communion with God in holy
things, then we may have a holy and more comfortable uſe of the creatures.
As before we noted when we have ſolemnized the blood of Chriſt, then we
may enjoy ſweetneſſe from the comforts of the earth; ſo now, when wee
have enjoyed communion with God in his Ordinances, then it is a fit time
to have a holy uſe of the creatures, yea then you muſt be carefull of having a
holy uſe of the creatures; as ſoone as ever they came from the Paſſe-over
the firſt day they were to celebrate the firſt fruits unto God,</p>
               <p>From whence,</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Obſ.</note> After the blood of Chriſt is ſprinkled upon the conſcience, then
men will be ready to dedicate things unto God. Then as <hi>Zacheus</hi> ſaid,
<hi>Halfe my goods I give to the poore;</hi> here are my goods, here is my eſtate,
doth the Church, doth my brethren ſtand in need of helpe? Loe wee are
ready to offer them up unto God.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Obſ.</note> The firſt of bleſſings are to be offered up unto God. God gives
them a charge, that the firſt of the firſt of all the fruits of their land ſhould
be offered unto him,<note place="margin">Exod. 13. 19.</note> all that commeth afterward ſhould be the more bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.
Learne this you young ones, dedicate the firſt of your years unto God,
the very firſt of your firſt, the dawning of your years.</p>
               <p>Now aſſoone as they had dedicated their firſt fruits,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> when harveſt was
done, then comes the Feaſt of Pentecoſt: then they rejoyced in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation of harveſt. If you dedicate your young dayes unto God, when
the conſummation of your years comes, how may you keepe a Feaſt of
Pentecoſt! The Jews firſt deditated the firſt fruits, fifty dayes before, and
then at the fifty dayes end they kept their joyfull Feaſt of Pentecoſt, ſo might
you if you dedicated your young yeares unto God, On the other ſide,
what a ſad thing will it be for old men that but now begin to thinke of
God and Chriſt; it is well you do ſo; but you cannot doe it comfortably
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:42662:160"/>
as you might have done, if you had begun in your younger yeares. If the
Jewes when their harveſt was done had brought two loaves unto God,
might God ſay, why did you not bring the firſt fruits unto me? God might
ſo upbraid you, but however come into God and he will not upbraid you,
he upbraideth no man, but yet the comfort will not be ſo much becauſe
your conſciences will upbraid you.</p>
               <p>Fiftly,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> note this, Happy is the man that when he comes to reap the fruit of
his actions, ſhall have a feaſt of joy. Thus is was with the Jews, the very
beginning of their harveſt was with a Feaſt, and the concluſion with a Feaſt
toe. All the actions of our lives are a ſowing of ſeed, if you ſow ſparingly
you ſhall reap ſparingly, and happy thoſe men when they come to reap, that
both the beginning and concluſion of their reaping ſhall be a joyfull feaſting.
Many ſow merrily, but they reap horrour and anguiſh; but when the Saints
come to reap, they ſhall have a Feaſt of joy. <hi>At thy right hand are joyes
and pleaſures for evermore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6.<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> At the fiftieth day then they were to ſolemnize the mercy of God in
giving to them the fruits of the earth for their harveſt.</p>
               <p>Hence this Note,</p>
               <p>Much praiſe is due to God for the Fruits of the earth, for outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts,
How much praiſe then is due for JESUS CHRIST, and all
ſpirituall mercies in him? Though we ought to bleſſe God for the things of
the earth, yet we ſhould be ſo ſwallowed up in bleſſing God for his word &amp;
Ordinances, and ſpirituall mercies, as in compariſon our hearts ſhould be
above the Fruits of the earth. Therefore it is obſerveable, that in <hi>Ezekiel</hi>
where there is a Propheſie of the ſtate of the Church, ſet out by the Jewiſh
way of Feaſts, though there be mention of the <hi>Paſſeover,</hi> and <hi>new moones,</hi>
and <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> and of the <hi>Feaſt of Tabernacles,</hi> yet there is no mention of
the <hi>Feaſt of Pentecoſt,</hi> no mention of keeping a Feaſt for bleſſing God for
theſe things. Not but that they ſhould doe ſo, but that their hearts ſhould be
ſo carryed up with abundance of ſpirituall mercies, that then all for Chriſt,
and for heaven, and for eternity, their hearts ſhould be wholly ſet upon ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
things.</p>
               <p>7.<note place="margin">Obſ.</note> It was a great ingagement to them to uſe the creatures, when in the firſt
beginning they had dedicated them unto God, and in the concluſion of
harveſt they had ſolemnized his mercy in giving them the creatures. For
God did thereby teach them that they might be further engaged to uſe all
creatures for his ſervice. As it is a mighty engagement to any man if God
give him a heart to dedicate the beginning of a mercy unto God, and when
he hath got the mercy fulfilled, then in a ſolemne manner he bleſſeth God
for it, to make uſe of this mercy for Gods honour. Certainly the reaſon
why many are ſo looſe in their converſations, and doe not employ the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of God to his glory, is, becauſe they do not in a ſolemn manner bleſſe
God for that they enjoy. As in your trading, ſuppoſe you have ſome
comfortable Incomes, perhaps you take theſe comforts, and thanke
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:42662:160"/>
God in a ſlight manner for them, how doe you uſe them afterwards? onely
for your ſelves and for the fleſh. But when you heare of Incomes of riches
flowing in upon you, if you can then preſently take the firſt. Fruits and give
ſome part to Gods ſervice as a teſtimony of thankfulneſſe, and in your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
and cloſets in a ſolemne manner give God the glory for the good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
you have had in your eſtate, this will be a mighty ingagement to you
to uſe your eſtates for his ſervice.</p>
               <p>8. Mark at the firſt, in their preparation, they were to bring but a <hi>ſheafe,</hi>

this day, if God did give you any heart to give up your young years to him,
bleſſe God for it; but now when you are old, are you as forward as ever you
were? You ought to be not onely ſo, but much more abundant in the work

may decay, yet their is a promiſe that in their old age <hi>they ſhall flouriſh in the

ſin-offering, and a peace-offering in the Feaſt of Pentecoſt? what is the
difference of theſe three offerings?</p>
               <p>The difference is this; The burnt offering was in teſtimony of their high
reſpect to God, they wholly had reſpect to God in the burnt offering; that
is, they tendred up ſomething to God as a teſtimony of the high &amp; honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
eſteem they had of his Majeſty, it was wholly to be given up to him.</p>
               <p>Now in the other they had reſpect to themſelves, the ſin-offering was not
to offer a ſacrifice meerly to teſtifie reſpect to God, but to be a typicall ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
of Chriſts ſacrifice for ſins; they were to looke through their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
to Chriſt, and their ſin-offering was to be an atonement for their ſin.</p>
               <p>The Peace-offering was in thankſgiving for a mercy, or when they would
petition to God for a further mercy. All this muſt be done in the day of
Pentecoſt. But beſides this end of Pentecoſt, to ſolemnize the mercies of
God in their harveſt, there is an other that is conſtantly affirmed by the
Jewes, and I finde many Divines making no queſtion of it; but I finde it
not ſo clearly laid down in the word.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="318" facs="tcp:42662:161"/>
They ſay God in this feaſt did ſolemnize the giving of the law,<note place="margin">Lect. 9.</note> and this is
their ground, becauſe fifty dais after their coming out of Egypt was the time
of Gods giving the Law, and ſo they ſay Pentecoſt was appointed to bleſſe
God for giving the law. The Iews ſay that God dealt with them, as a King
ſhould deale with a poor man in priſon, firſt hee releaſeth him of his bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
and withall tells him, that after ſuch a time he will marry him to his
daughter; now ſay they, will not this man count every day, &amp; long untill this
time come? So when God did deliver us out of AEgypt, he told us that after
ſuch a time he would give us his law, and marry us to his daughter, which is
the law, and this is the reaſon why wee count ſo diſigently the very weeks,
nay the days, as longing for that time when we are to be marryed to the law,
when the Lord ſhall grant to us ſuch a mercy.</p>
               <p>From whence we may note,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> that we are not only to keep Gods law, but
to rejoyce in Gods law; not only to look at what is commanded as a duty,
but as a high priviledg, and ſo bleſſe God for the law. It is a higher thing
to love Gods law, and rejoyce in it then to obey it; <hi>Great peace ſhall they
have that love thy law; David</hi> profeſt that he <hi>loved the law of God more
then ſilver and gold,</hi> that it was <hi>ſweeter</hi> to him <hi>then the honey and the honey
combe.</hi> The Iews at this day do much reioyce when the law of God is read,
and in their Synagogues when the law of God is brought out, they lift up
their bodies in a kind of exlatation, reioycing that God gave this law unto
them.</p>
               <p>Further, the time of their Pentecoſt was the time of the deſcending of the
holy Ghoſt upon the Apoſtles: as God at that time gave the law by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
ſo the Spirit at that time came by Chriſt, to ſhew that we are in the
Goſpel to receive the Spirit of God, to inable us to fulfill the law. They had
the letter of the law, but in compariſon of what we have, they had not the
Spirit, but now the holy Ghoſt is come in a full meaſure; as hee then came
upon the Diſciples, ſo he comes now in the time of the Goſpel in a fuller
way then formerly, there is a continuall Pentecoſt.</p>
               <p>But the works of God do not of themſelves ſanctifie any time, except we
take that note with us, we may run into a thouſand abſurdities; if we argue
thus, becauſe the <hi>Iews</hi> had ſuch a time vve may have ſuch a time, or becauſe
there vvere ſuch bleſſings at that time, therefore vve may ſanctifie that day.
No, the vvorks of God do not ſanctifie any time of themſelves, it muſt be
the Word, ſome inſtitution or other, either the VVord vvritten, or ſome
immediate dictate of the Spirit that muſt ſanctifie any day. Certainly the
vvork of our redemption it ſelf is not enough to change the Sabbath, if vve
had not ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> me footing for a nevv inſtitution. VVee uſually give this ground
for a change of the day, becauſe of the greatneſſe of the worke; but though
the works of God be great, though never ſo great, it is not for us to ſanctifie
a day, it muſt be an inſtitution of God, or elſe wee ſinne in ſanctifying any
ſet and ſtated time for any ſuch work, for Chriſts reſurrection, or ſending
of the Spirit, except there come an inſtitution, though the work be as great
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:42662:161"/>
as any thing God ever did for the Iewes, it will be but will-worſhip in us,
and God will not be put off with this, What is not this as great a worke as
that the Iewes had, and may not we celebrate the memory of it as they did?
but God will ſay, <hi>Who required theſe things at your hands?</hi> Thus far you
may do, that is, bleſſe God for thoſe works all the dayes of your lives, but
to ſanctifie any particular day for them, certainly that cannot be done
without ſin; we have our warrant for the Lords day as well as the greatneſſe
of the work, becauſe of the practiſe of the Apoſtles who were inſpired by
the holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>The next is the feaſt of Trumpets, onely one particular about it at this
time, becauſe providence makes it ſo ſeaſonable. In the ſeventh moneth,
(which was the firſt moneth of their <hi>Annus Civilis</hi>) there were three
feaſts.</p>

               <p>The firſt was the feaſt of Trumpets; now there was a three-fold uſe of

confeſſe are very improbable, but there are two very probable. The one
is, this feaſt was to celebrate the New-yeer with them; as upon every new

of the moneth, ſo in the beginning of the yeare they had a feaſt to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
the beginning of the year, that was this feaſt, for it was on the firſt day
of their civill yeare; ſo that it is very probable that feaſt was appointed to
bleſſe God for the new yeere, as well as they had one to celebrate the new
moneth. It was Gods inſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Antiſiodorenſe,</hi> in <hi>France</hi> in the yeer 614. it was the judgement of that

keep their worſhip and obſervation of their Calends, (that is, the beginning

<pb n="320" facs="tcp:42662:162"/>
ſaith, that the Kalends of <hi>Ianuary</hi> are rather to be taken heed of, then to be
accounted Kalends, and ſo to be ſanctified; And further, hee ſaith, the
Church hath appointed a ſolemn feaſt to be upon that very day, becauſe o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
the notorious abuſes there were wont to be upon that day. And <hi>Polydore
Virgil</hi> ſaith, that theſe ſolemnities of Lawrell and Bayes, and maſques, and
mummings, and ſuch vanities, they all come from the Heathens <hi>Bachanali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a,</hi>
and <hi>Saturnalia,</hi> that were wont to be at that time of the year. However
therefore we put them upon Chriſt, and think we honour him, and call it
the Circumciſion day of Chriſt, yet by thoſe cuſtomes we diſhonour him,
for they are rather Heatheniſh then Chriſtian, To doe it, I ſay, becauſe we
think to conſecrate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ine; though there may be ſome naturall reaſon of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing,
yet no ground for conſecration.</p>
               <p>Let no man object and ſay, theſe ſolemnities have beene a long time in
the Church. It is true, theſe are ancient, but from whence comes the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity?
It comes from hence, becauſe Chriſtians being newly converted
out of Paganiſme, they would keepe as much as poſſibly they might of the
Pagan cuſtomes, only they would give them a turn, turn them to Chriſtian
ſolemnities, but the riſe was from their Pagan cuſtomes: therefore all the
argument of antiquity, either for theſe, or Ceremonies, or Prelaticall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
it comes from this ground, becauſe their pagan cuſtomes were
ſo, and they lived among pagans, and having been lately pagans, they ſavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and ſmelt of Heatheniſme ſtill. So now, many plead that ſuch things
were in the firſt Reformation: no marvail they retained them, for they were
but newly come out of popery, and they ſavoured and ſmelt of popery.
Indeed to plead the antiquity of theſe things, which men muſt ſhew when
they are put to it, is one of the greateſt arguments againſt them. Thus was
they Feaſt of <hi>All-Saints</hi> turned from the Feaſt <hi>Pantheon,</hi> and ſo the Feaſt
of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> which they call <hi>Candlemas,</hi> the Heathens had the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtivity
of their goddeſſe <hi>Febru</hi> (who was the Mother of <hi>Mars</hi>) upon that
day, from whence the name of our moneth <hi>February</hi> cometh, they did then
celebrate that time with Candles, and ſuch things, as papiſts doe now. This
antiquity have you for celebrating of <hi>Candlemas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The like may be ſaid for the argument of antiquity for the <hi>Prelates.</hi> O
ſay ſome, ſuch a kind of government hath been ever ſince Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
hath been in <hi>England.</hi> Grant that there hath been ſome kind of Biſhops
ever ſince, but from whence came they? We find in Hiſtories, that when
the <hi>Pagans</hi> were here in <hi>England,</hi> they had their <hi>Flamins,</hi> and their <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamins,
London</hi> was one, and <hi>Yorke</hi> was another, and when they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
to the Chriſtian Religion, yet ſtill keeping ſome of their Heatheniſh
cuſtomes, inſtead of their <hi>Arch-flamins,</hi> they made <hi>Arch-biſhops,</hi> and of
their <hi>Flamins, Biſhops,</hi> and that in their very places, as <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Yorke,</hi>

Trumpets,</hi> you ſhall finde the inſtitution of it in <hi>Leviticus</hi>
23. 24. <hi>You ſhall have a Sabbath, a memorial of blowing
of Trumpets,</hi> Now there were divers ends of Gods inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of this Feaſt, I have ſpoken of one; the ſecond rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of that Feaſt, the Hebrews thinke, was a remembrance
of <hi>Iſaacs</hi> deliverance, when he ſhould have been ſacrificed, and the Ram
caught by the hornes to be ſacrificed in his ſtead; they drew it from this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
becauſe that Feaſt is called <hi>A memoriall,</hi> (ſay they) to remember
the deliverance of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and it muſt be by the Trumpets of Rams hornes,
to call this to remembrance, the deliverance of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and a Ram ſacrificed
in his ſtead; this is the Iews opinion of it, but it ſeemes to be farre from the
meaning of the holy Ghoſt. A third reaſon of the Feaſt of Trumpets, ſome
ſay, (<hi>Cajetan</hi> amongſt others) was inſtituted for a memoriall of Gods gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the lay by ſound of the trumpet; that is not likely neither, becauſe this
Feaſt was not kept at the time of Gods giving the law, if there were any time
for the celebration of giving the law, it muſt be at the Feaſt of Pentecoſt.</p>
               <p>A fourth, it was for a celebration of a memoriall of Gods goodneſs to them
in the time of war, for all the mercies of God unto them in their wars, which
was declared by the blowing of the trumpets. But I rather take another
reaſon, to be a maine and principall reaſon of Gods inſtitution of this Feaſt,
to be a preparation to the Feaſt of atonement and expiation, and therefore
(ſaith <hi>Calvin</hi>) it is called <hi>a memoriall, Levit.</hi> 23, for this reaſon, to put
them in minde to humble themſelves before God, to afflict their hearts in
the day of atonement; and ſecondly, <hi>a memoriall</hi> before God, that God
may remember them for mercy, ſo the Iews obſerve from the ſeventh day
of the firſt moneth, unto the tenth day, there was more then ordinary exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes
in giving of almes, in praying, in going to their ſynagogues, they were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
devout for thoſe ten dayes in way of preparation for the day of Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
of Expiation. From whence note,</p>
               <p>It is of this uſe to us to prepare for the day of Faſting; Miniſters ſhould
blow their trumpets to the people to prepare them for that day: God hath
accepted of thoſe poore kinde of faſts that we have kept, abundance of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
we have received on them; there is ſcarce any one Faſt day that is kept,
but we preſently hear good news after it; if we had kept Faſt dayes as we
ought, if we had been prepared as we ſhould, O what might we have obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of God by this time! if God accepts ſuch poor things as we do, (as God
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:42662:163"/>
knowes they are poore and meane) if we had every time a trumpet blown
before us to prepare us for the day of atonement, what atonements might
England have made with God before this time!<note place="margin">The day of Atonement <hi>Feſtum expiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis:</hi> eight things eſpecially obſervable in it.</note> to reade underſtandingly thoſe things you reade about the Feaſt of Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets.
The next Feaſt was the <hi>feaſt of Expiation,</hi> in the tenth day; I thought
not to have ſpoken of that, becauſe the Feaſt of Expiation is a Faſt rather
then a Feaſt, but that is meant here as well as any of the other, for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
though it were a Faſt, yet the Hebrew word here that is tranſlated <hi>ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
Feaſts,</hi> ſignifies onely a ſetled, ſtated, ſolemn time.</p>
               <p>And Secondly, It was a great mercy to them to have ſuch a day of Faſt;
though the day of atonement, be a day of afflicting themſelves, yet it is the
cauſe of rejoycing to a nation, that God grants them ſuch a day of atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
it is the ſpeciall meanes to make way to the joy of a nation, and
therefore this is included amongſt the other: now the hiſtory of that, you
have in theſe two famous Scriptures, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16. and <hi>Levit.</hi> 23. In this day
of atonement, the tenth day of the ſeventh month, there are divers things
very obſerveable, and uſefull for theſe times.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The firſt is, The ſolemn charge that God gave for the afflicting mens
ſouls upon that day; you ſhall finde in a few verſes three ſeverall times a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
charge to afflict their ſoules, to humble their ſouls, <hi>Levit.</hi> 23. 27. 29.
32. God appointed one day in the year for all the Jews <hi>to afflict their ſouls,</hi>
to make an atonement between God and them, in a day of Faſt, and they
were charged to be ſure to afflict their ſouls then, and that ſoul that did not,
God threatened <hi>to cut it off.</hi>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond thing obſerveable is, that the Prieſt was <hi>to goe into the Holy
of Holies,</hi> where he was to go but once a year; <hi>Levit.</hi> 16. the beginning
and the latter end compared together; you ſhall finde it. This may teach
us thus much;<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> If ever we are to looke upon JESUS CHRIST in the

               <p>4. In their day of Atonement, the Prieſt was to lay the ſins of the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
upon the ſcape goat. The ſtory of the <hi>ſcape goat</hi> was this, The Prieſt
muſt come and <hi>confeſſe the ſins of the congregation, laying his hand upon
the head of the goat,</hi> and then he muſt <hi>ſend this goat into the wilderneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The meaning is of great uſe to us; Jeſus Chriſt he is the ſcape goat, and
we are in the dayes of our humiliations to come and lay our hands upon Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, and to confeſſe all our ſins over him, and look upon all our ſins as
laid upon him. Now the ſcape goat was to be <hi>ſent into the wilderneſſe:</hi>
What is that? That is, ſent into a land of forgetfulneſs, ſo as the Iews ſhould
never come to ſee that goat again that their ſins were laid upon, it ſignified
to them, that their ſins were now ſo forgiven them, that they ſhould never
hear of their ſins againe. Thus are our ſins upon Chriſt, as we ſhall never
come to ſee, nor heare more of them, In the day of our Faſts we ſhould thus
exerciſe our Faith upon Chriſt.</p>
               <p>A fift thing that was to be done, was <hi>to ſprinkle the blood of the ſlaine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
goat upon the mercie-ſeat, and before it.</hi> It is the blood of Chriſt that is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and before Gods mercie-ſeat, that procures mercy from thence for us.</p>
               <p>The ſixt thing. In the 16, of <hi>Leviticus, ver.</hi> 12. the Prieſt muſt <hi>take a
cenſer full of burning coales of fire from off the Altar, and his hanfull of
ſweet incenſe beaten ſmall.</hi> This he muſt doe in the day of Atonement; to
teach us, That in the day of our ſolemne Faſts, we muſt be ſure to get our
hearts full of burning coales from the Altar, full of affection and zeale, full
of mighty workings of ſpirit to God, although you that are godly, and ſo are
Prieſts to God, at other times come with few coales from the Altar, a little
affection, your affections are ſcarce heated, but in a day of Atonement you
muſt come with your hearts full of coales, and be ſure it be fire from the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,

incenſe, as is a ſweet favour in the noſtrills of God. Many of you in the day
of a faſt ſeem to be full of prayer, but is this prayer a ſweet incenſe to God or
no? how ſhall I know that? by this, God hath appointed the incenſe, upon
the day of <hi>atonement,</hi> to be that, that muſt come from ſpices beaten, if thy
heart be beaten to powder, and thy prayers be but the ſavour, and the odour

muſt be clouded, but clouded with <hi>incenſe;</hi> the <hi>incenſe</hi> that was ſent up,
was a type of the ſweet perfume of the merit of Jeſus Chriſt; Now in the
day of <hi>atonement</hi> we muſt look up to the mercy ſeate, as clouded with the
merit of Chriſt, clouded, that is, the merit of Jeſus Chriſt round about it, as
a cloud, and covering the Mercy Seat, to teach us that no man muſt dare
to look upon the Mercy Seat of God as it is in it ſelfe, but he muſt have the
<hi>incenſe</hi> of the merit of Chriſt round about it, the reaſon was given why the
Lord muſt have the <hi>incenſe</hi> as a cloud to cover the Mercy Seat, <hi>leſt hee die;</hi>
if he had entered into the holy place, and there looked upon the Mercy Seat,
and not clouded by the <hi>incenſe,</hi> he muſt have died for it; thoſe men that think
to come into Gods preſence, and look upon God out of Chriſt, and think to
receive mercy from God out of Chriſt, they die for it, this is the damnation
of mens ſoules, to look upon God as mercifull out of Chriſt, mercy is an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
of God, but if we dare (who are ſinfull creatures) to looke upon this
attribute of mercy, and not have the <hi>incenſe</hi> of Chriſt merit, it is the way
to deſtroy our ſouls. O how many thouſands are in hell for this! many who
are afflicted for their ſins, and cry to God to forgive their ſins, and believe
he is mercifull, and think to exerciſe their faith upon God as mercifull, and
yet not looking upon the mercy ſeat as clouded with the merit of Chriſt, it
proves the deſtruction of their ſoules. In a faſt, when you come to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

permitted in other ſolemn days, that was not permitted in that day; this may
teach us, that in the dayes of faſting, above any dayes, we muſt get our ſouls
now ſeparated from the world, there muſt be a reſt in our hearts, a reſt
from ſinne, a reſt from the world, it muſt be a Sabbath of Sabbaths unto

               <p>Now notwithſtanding God had given this ſolemne charge for this day of

               <p>One note more from this Feaſt of Expiation, it is very probable that the

in the times of publique infection, when they had a publique plague in their

it noted that thereby they were to acknowledge Gods goodneſſe to them,
that whereas they had lived forty yeares in the wilderneſſe, in a dry place,
they were now brought to a fruitfull land, that had much water, which was
a great matter in thoſe hot countries, and therefore they were to bring the
willows of the brooke, and goodly trees, thoſe that might moſt teſtifie the
goodneſſe of God to them in delivering them from the wilderneſſe, and in

for ſo was the diſpenſation of God towards his people, for forty yeares they

and therefore when <hi>David</hi> began to thinke that he had a houſe of Cedar,

ſpeake of a houſe for me?</hi> as if he had ſaid, As long as my people went up

and a booth for my dwelling, thus God is willing to ſuite himſelfe with the
condition of his people; Is the condition of his people in a fleeting way,
then I will be ſo too, ſaith God; If your conditions be afflicted, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetled,
I will be ſo too; In all their afflictions, God was afflicted, in all
their unſetledneſſe, God ſeemed to be ſo too.</p>
               <p>Indeed afterwards when Gods people came to be in a ſetled eſtate in
Ieruſalem, then God would have a houſe built him; God would hereby
teach us, That if himſelfe be content to be in a condition like us, then we
muſt be content to be in a condition like him, as thus; when we are afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
will God be afflicted with us? when we are unſetled, will God be (as it
were) unſetled with us? then let us not thinke it much, if afterwards God
be in an afflicted way, his truth and his Goſpell be in a ſuffering way; let
us be willing to ſuffer with God; when God is magnified and praiſed, then
our hearts ſhould be inlarged too, and rejoyce in his praiſe; we ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the condition that God is in the world, &amp; we muſt ſuite our ſelves with
that. Again, would God have them once a yeare to celebrate the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>

to have a reall remembrance of our low &amp; mean conditions we had
heretofore; doth God now bring us into a more ſetled condition then here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore?
Let us not forget in what an afflicted condition we were in, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetled,
how ready we were to fleet up and down; If God ſhould grant his
people, that they ſhould think themſelves ſetled in their own kingdoms, yet
let them never forget the time, when they were unſetled in this &amp; other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
there hath been a great part of the people of God, whoſe thoughts have
been, what ſhall become of them, &amp; whether ſhall they go, and perhaps to
this day many have ſuch thougts, unleſſe there be ſome ſpeciall mercies of
God prevent it, yet may be the condition of thouſands in the land, before a

that they ſhould never forget their dwelling in Tabernacles.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Note the time of their Feaſt of Tabernacles, they were to

dwell in booths, <hi>upon the fifteenth day of their moneth,</hi> it was but five dayes

               <p>After our humiliations for our ſins,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> and making up our peace with God,
it is good to keep our hearts low with the meditation of the uncertainty of all

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, God would have their hearts kept low by the actuall going in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

               <p>It is a good way to keep thoſe men humbled,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> that are raiſed from a low

Now they were to joyn all together, and to bleſſe God for all the fruits of
the Earth. That this is Gods end, is cleare in <hi>Deut. 16. 13, 14. Thou
ſhalt obſerve the feaſt of Tabernacles, after thou haſt gathered in thy corn
and thy wine, and thou ſhalt rejoyce, &amp;c. becauſe the Lord thy God ſhall
bleſſe thee in all thy encreaſe, therefore thou ſhalt ſurely rejoyce.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From hence there is this leſſon.</p>
               <p>It is uſefull to remember what a poor condition we were once in, and the
uncertainty of all things that we have; even when we have got our riches in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our houſes, when all things are in our poſſeſſion, it is not ſo much to think
how uncertain they are, when they are growing in the field, but after the
Vintage was gotten in, then they were to keep the feaſt of <hi>Tabernacles,</hi> to
remember the uncertain condition of all things in the world, this we are very
loath to doe, it is unſutable to our natures, and therefore this feaſt of
Tabernacles was much neglected among the Jewes untill ſuch time as they

<pb n="329" facs="tcp:42662:166"/>
feaſt of Tabernacles, more ſolemnly then ever they had done, as we finde
<hi>Nehem. 8. 17. Since the day of Ioſhua the ſon of Nun, they had not done ſo,</hi>
they never kept the feaſt of Tabernacles ſo ſolemnly from their firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
into Canaan, as then they did, now being come out of priſon they
could remember the uncertainty of all things in the world; men forget the
uncertainty of all things in the world, but if they be driven from houſe and
home, and loſe all, then they remember what they have heard and confeſſed;
of the uncertainty of all worldly things: ſome of our brethren who are
plundered and driven from their habitations, if God ſhould ever reſtore
them to their habitations againe, then their hearts would be enlarged in
bleſſing God, then they would be more ſenſible of the uncertainty of the
comforts of the creature then ever before.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Feaſt of Tabernacles had an aime at Chriſt and the ſtate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
of a Chriſtian, it was to typifie JESUS CHRIST to come into the
world, and to pitch his tents amongſt us, as <hi>John 1. 14. he dwelt amongſt
us;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                     </gap>.</note> he came and <hi>pitched his Tabernacle amongſt us,</hi> it is in the Greek, and
the ſtate of a Chriſtian likewiſe, is an abiding Tabernacle, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 1. If
our earthly houſe of this Tabernacle be diſſolved,</hi> till we goe where JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS
CHRIST is gone before us, <hi>to prepare manſions for us, Iohn</hi> 14.
our dwelling is in Tabernacles.</p>
               <p>In the offerings that God appointed to offer in this their feaſt, <hi>Numb.</hi>
29. 12. there are ſome things very obſervable, but hard to finde the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of, the feaſt was to be kept ſeven dayes, the firſt day was a great day,
and the laſt day a great day, <hi>the firſt day</hi> there were 13. <hi>bullocks</hi> to be offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and 14. <hi>lambes, the ſecond day,</hi> there was but 12. <hi>bullocks,</hi> and the
<hi>third day</hi> but 11. and the <hi>fourth day</hi> but 10. and ſo every day one decrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
(as you may ſee there) and the <hi>laſt day,</hi> there was but <hi>one</hi> offered,</p>
               <p>Now divers Expoſitors have ſought to finde out the meaning of this. I
doe not finde any ſuch thing in all the Scripture, as this is, but onely in this
place, <hi>Calvin</hi> confeſſes when he ſpeakes of this, that for his part he doth not
underſtand the meaning of it, and rather then to make gueſſes of it, &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties,
I will ſaith he be ſilent in it, &amp; yet he ventures upon a conjecture
a very unlikely one, therefore I ſhall not name it. That which is moſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſeems to be in two things. The firſt is, they muſt offer every day leſſe
and leſſe, that is (ſaith another interpreter) to ſhew their increaſe in ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
that they ſhould grow to more and more perfection, every day of
their feaſt, and ſo have leſſe need of Sacrifices then they had before, and ſo
it will afford a good note to us, that when we come to keepe dayes to God,
every day we ſhould grow more and more in ſanctification, and have leſſe
and leſſe ſin to anſwer for, then we had before.</p>
               <p>Another interpretation that is given, is, that it was to ſhew the ceſſation
of the ſacrifices of the Jewes, that they were to decreaſe day by day,
and this I take rather to be the meaning, becauſe the laſt day is <hi>but one
bullocke</hi> that was offered, and yet the Text ſaith, that that was <hi>the great
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:42662:167"/>
day of the Feaſt,</hi> when there was feweſt ſacrifices to be offered. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 37.
<hi>The laſt and the great day of the feaſt, Jeſus cryed, if any man thirſt, let
him come unto me;</hi> there is ſomwhat to be noted about Chriſt there, though
it is true, it was <hi>the feaſt of dedication,</hi> which was their own Feaſt, from
whence many would prove the lawfulneſſe of holy daies, yet the truth is, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
examination you ſhall finde there is ſcarce ſtrength enough, from that
place to prove it, though it be lawfull to take the advantage of ſuch times,
but it will appeare there, that it was <hi>the Feaſt of Tabernacles,</hi> as in 2 <hi>Chro.</hi>
8. 9. Their Feaſt of the dedication of the Temple, was at that time that the
Feaſt of Tabernacles was; one thing is to be obſerved from Chriſts being
there at the Feaſt, <hi>the laſt and the great day, Jeſus cryed, if any man thirſt,
let him come unto me;</hi> Why did Chriſt upon the great day of the Feaſt cry
out thus, <hi>If any man thirſt, let him come unto me to drinke?</hi> one reaſon
may be, becauſe when men are moſt ſtrongly poſſeſſed with the uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of all outward things in the world, then they are fit to entertaine the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
then fit to heare of JESUS CHRIST, when their hearts are taken
off from the world, and they looke upon all things here as unſetled, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
of that feaſt is a ſpeciall preparation to the Goſpell. <hi>Eſay,</hi> 40. 6. 7,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> The preparation to the good tidings of the Goſpel, is the Proclamation
that <hi>All fleſh is graſſe, and all the goodlineſſe thereof as the flower of the
field:</hi> yea the withering of the graſſe, and the fading of the flower muſt be
proclaimed again and againe. And then ſeaſonably and acceptably it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
<hi>ver. 6. O Zion, that bringeſt good tidings, behold your God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tremelius</hi> thinkes that the reaſon of the expreſſion of CHRIST at this
time was, from the cuſtome of the Iews at this Feaſt; at the feaſt of Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles
the Iews were wont with great joy to bring ſtore of water out of the
River of <hi>Shiloh</hi> to the Temple, where being delivered to the Prieſt, he pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
it out upon the Altar, together with wine, and all the people ſung that of
<hi>Iſaiah, with joy ſhall ye draw water out of the wells of ſalvation;</hi> though it
were their own invention, Chriſt takes a hint upon it, they accuſtomed
themſelves to draw water, and powre it out, Chriſt ſaith, what do you ſtand
upon this ceremony of yours, this your cuſtome will die and periſh in the uſe
of it, but come to me and there you ſhall have water, I am the well of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
a ſpring of grace ſhall be continually in the heart of that man that
beleeveth in me. One note more is obſervable in this Feaſt, we have a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie
that in the times of the goſpel, the feaſt of Tabernacles ſhould be kept
then, that is in the truth of it, not in the ceremony. In <hi>Zach.</hi> 14. 16. there is
a Propheſy that when Chriſt cometh, the very truth of the feaſt of taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
then all people ſhall <hi>worſhip the true God, and keep the feaſt of Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles.</hi>
Why is it there Propheſied that all people ſhall come and keep that
feaſt? the reaſon may be this, this feaſt is named, becauſe in the times of the
goſpel, men ſhall acknowledge their outward comforts to be from God, &amp;

                  </gap> in the times of the goſpell, this ſhall be made more evident to the hearts
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:42662:167"/>
of people, then ever before, the more JESUS CHRIST ſhall be
known in the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the more ſhall the hearts of men be taken up with the
knowledge of God in every creature, and of the uncertainty of every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and have their hearts taken of from the comforts of the world, and
never account any ſetled condition here, but account themſelves pilgrims,
and ſtrangers; that is a ſigne that the Goſpel hath prevailed with your ſpirits,
if you have your hearts taken off from the creature, and you looke upon
your ſelves, as ſtrangers in the world, and looke for an abiding City, then
do you keep in an Evangelicall ſenſe this feaſt of Tabernacles.</p>
               <p>Or ſecondly, if it be meant of the glorious ſetled condition God in the
latter dayes ſhall bring his Saints unto, yet then they ſhall remember with
thankfulneſſe, what their poor unſetled condition once was.</p>
               <p>Thus you have had a view of the chiefe of the Jewiſh Feaſts, which God
threatens here ſhall <hi>ceaſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are onely theſe three Obſervations to be drawn from altogether.<note place="margin">Obſ.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, Even thoſe things that are appointed by God himſelfe, if once they
be abuſed, God will not own them, but then they are accounted ours rather
then Gods, <hi>her</hi> ſabbaths, why not <hi>my</hi> ſabbaths? why not <hi>Gods</hi> ſabbaths?
God did appoint them, but becauſe they had abuſed them, God would not
own them; <hi>her</hi> ſabbaths, and <hi>her</hi> ſolemn Feaſts. The Ordinances of God,
though never ſo good in themſelves, if you pollute them, God rejects them,
they are your ordinances then and not Gods, looke then that all ordinances
be,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> as God would have them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is a grievous and lamentable affliction upon any people,
for God to deprive them of his ſabbaths and ordinances, his ordinances are
included in their ſolemne Feaſts, nay (ſaith God) you will goe on in your
wickedneſſe, and would put me off with your ſabbaths, and ſolemne meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and with thoſe things that were once my ordinances, you will ſatisfie
me with them, though you continue in your wickedneſs, no, you ſhall be
deprived of them, you ſhall have no more ſabbaths, no more ſolemne Feaſt
dayes; it is a ſad affliction for a people to have no more ſabbaths.</p>
               <p>How many of you neglect ſolemne meetings of Gods people? time may
come when God will rend theſe priviledges from you, and then your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
will grate upon you, O the ſabbaths that once we had! O the ſolemn
meetings that once we enjoyed! but our hearts were vaine and ſlight; we
did not make uſe of them, and now they are gone, now perhaps thou art
caſt into a goale, or into a dungeon, and there thou keepeſt thy ſabbaths &amp;
thinkeſt upon thy ſolemne meetings. O how unworthy is this land of ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths?
how did we ſet our ſelves to perſecute thoſe that kept ſabbaths? there
was never any ſuch a thing in any Chriſtian nation: other places though
they are ſomewhat looſe upon their ſabbaths, yet they never perſecute them
that will keep ſabbath: how juſtly might God have taken away our ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths?
let us acknowledge Gods free grace; what reproach hath it been in
England to aſſemble to heare Sermons? how juſtly might God have taken
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:42662:168"/>
away theſe ſolemne Aſſembles from us long before this? let us pray that
what ever judgement God ſends upon us, he will not take away our Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths,
nor our ſolemne aſſemblies, but that we may ſtill enjoy thoſe we
have, and enjoy them to better purpoſe then ever we have done.</p>
               <p>3.<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> God hath no need of our ſervices; If God call upon us to worſhip
him, it is for our good, not for any need he hath of what we doe. What do
I care, ſaith God, whether I have any Sabbaths kept or no? I can provide
for my glory, what ever becomes of your duties; I need them not, I can be
glorious without you.</p>
               <p>But theſe threats are but to take away things that are ſpirituall; carnall
hearts thinke if they may live and proſper in the world, what care they for
Sabbaths, and for ſolemn meetings? Tell them of taking away Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
tell them of truth of Gods worſhip, what is that to them? Let us have
our peace, our trading, and our outward bleſſings, and truth will follow, O
no, a gracious heart will rather reaſon thus, O Lord, let us have thy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
let us have thy Goſpel, and then for our Vines and Fig-trees, our tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
and our outward bleſſings, we will leave them to thy diſpoſe; if thou
will give us thy Sabbaths, and thy Ordinances, we will truſt thee for our
Vines, and for our Fig-trees. But if the Lord be ſo angry to deny us his
Ordinances, how can we ever thinke that he will be ſo mercifull to us, to
continue our peace, or our civill liberties? No ſure, if Truth be gone,
Vines and Fig-trees will not ſtay long: The next words therefore are, <hi>I will
deſtroy her Vines and her Fig-trees.</hi> The Lord may ſuffer thoſe places that
never had Sabbaths and Ordinances to proſper in their Civill <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eace a long
time, but where theſe have, and the wrath of God be ſo incenſed as to take
away theſe, it cannot be expected that outward peace and plenty can hold
long there, <hi>Firſt ſeeke the kingdom of heaven,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>and all theſe
things ſhall be added unto you:</hi> No, (ſay they) let us firſt ſeeke the
kingdome of earth, and the things of heaven will be added to us; which
ſhewes the ſleightneſſe of their account of heavenly things. As the paper
and the thred in a ſhop, is given in to the commodity, it is added, if a man
bargaine for the paper and thred, and think the commodity will be given
in, what a folly were it? Many men have their thoughts altogether upon the
things of this life, and they think the Goſpel will be given into the bargaine,
as if they have peace, they ſhall no queſtion have truth, as if the Goſpel were
the paper and thred, and the things of the world were the commodities. It
is your wiſdome if you would enjoy outward peace, let your hearts be for
Ordinances, cry to God for Ordinances, and then God will take care you
ſhall ſit under your Vines, and under your Fig-trees peace.</p>

uſually after the act is over, when the ſinner looks back, he ſees nothing but
ſhame, guilt and horrour; Sinners ſcarce dare look back to their ſinnes after
they are committed, except ſuch as are moſt deſperately hardned in their
ſins, they dare not think of what they have done: but here you ſee, they look
at what they have done, and bleſſe themſelves, as if they had got a goodly
reward by it: As the ſight of the evil conſequences of ſin is a means to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
ſo the apprehending of gayning by ſin, is a ſpeciall meanes to harden
in ſin. <hi>Judas</hi> thought it a brave thing to get the thirty pieces, yet when hee
ſaw the evill fruit that his ſin produced, he looked with horrour upon his ſin,
his ſoule ſunk under the burden of it: If a <hi>Judas</hi> looking after ſinn, hath his
ſpirit filled with horrour, what hope is there then of ſuch a one, as looking
after it, bleſſeth himſelfe as a gainer by it! If a man either proſpers at that
time he ſins, or proſpers more a little after he hath committed a ſin, then he
did before, or ſo proſpers as that he conceives his ſin to be ſome way inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
to bring in that gain that was got: this hardens exceedingly.</p>

               <p>It is a provoking ſin to attribute the bleſſings of God to our own wicked
ſinfull ways, and thereby to harden our hearts in thoſe ways. It is too much

them more, this exceedingly provokes. Ile give you one notable example
of this wretchedneſſe of mans heart, and indeed it is a very dreadfull one, I
had very credible relation from a Miniſter, who being at Hamburgh, hee
was told this ſtory. There was a conſultation of many of the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of
Germany at that Town in the time of the ſoreſt diſtreſſes and calamities that
were in <hi>Germanie,</hi> the <hi>Miniſters</hi> were <hi>Lutherans,</hi> they conſulted to find
out what might be the cauſe why the hand of God was ſo heavy upon <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
in thoſe parts where they lived, that ſo they might reform what was
amiſſe, and make their peace with God, the iſſe of their <hi>conſultations</hi> came
to this, that the reaſon of their <hi>calamities</hi> and troubles that were upon them,
was becauſe the Images of their Churches were not adorned enough: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there was not coſt enough beſtowed upon them, they were not deck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as they thought they ſhould have been: and therefore for the preventing
of the continuance of thoſe <hi>calamities</hi> in thoſe parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> they una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly
conſented to improve all the ſtrength they had to beautifie and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn
the Images in their Churches more: this was a ſad thing for <hi>Miniſters</hi>
who profeſſing againſt Popery, as the <hi>Lutherans</hi> do, they indeed keep I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages
in Churches: But could it be thought that they ſhould be thus vaine,
yea wicked, as to attribute the want of their Vines and fig-trees to the want
of their <hi>ſuperſtitious</hi> vanities, and to bring up their <hi>conſultations</hi> to this
concluſion, that if they were more zealous of the one, they ſhould the more
proſper in the other? was not this a ſore and grievous evill, going neare to
the heart of God?</p>
               <p>Many attribute the increaſe of their eſtates to their lying, to their over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaching,

fill their maſters houſes with violence and deceit:</hi> That is, the ſervants of
great men, who by oppreſſion and by fraud bring in gain to their Maſters
houſes, and then they leap upon the threſhold for joy, applauding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in the ſucceſſe they have had in their wicked wayes: It is uſuall in
whatſoever ways men are, if they meet with any proſperous ſucceſs, to
bleſs themſelves, as if this ſucceſs came in the rather becauſe of thoſe ways,
let the ways be never ſo wicked: Of late have not ſome made the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
they have had great ſucceſs, &amp; have made an argument that their ways
have been good, and God hath bleſſed them, becauſe they have done as
they have, though we know their ways to be ſuch as brings moſt fearfull
guilt upon themſelves, and their families, and we have all cauſe to have our
hearts tremble within us, to think of them; and if it be through ſeducement,
and not through a worſe principle, to pray to God, <hi>O Lord forgive them,
for they know not what they doe:</hi> and for the ſucceſs they boaſt of, who

it is the intention of the holy Ghoſt to expreſs a judgment beyond the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

<hi>David</hi> apprehended them ſo cruell,<note place="margin">A fearfull judgement to fall into the hands of men.</note> that he had rather fall into the
hands of Tygers, and wilde beaſts in the wilderneſſe, then into theirs. I could
give you notable examples of people that would rather endure any miſery
in the world, then be given up into the hands of their enemies. That ſtory is
moſt famous of Numantia in Spaine, when <hi>Scipio</hi> came againſt it, and they
were afraid it would be taken, all the young men firſt took all the old men
in the City and killed them with as faire a death as they could; then they
brought all the treaſure and riches of the City to the market place, and ſet all
on fire, and after that they all took poyſon and poyſoned themſelves, and
thus in one day old and young, and all in the City, were quite deſtroyed, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then they would fall into the hands of their enemies. <hi>Pſa. 22. 20. Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

he did indeed really fight with beaſts, as being one way of torment they put
the Chriſtians to, to fight with beaſts; but it is rather thought by moſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters,
that the meaning is with men that were beaſtly, with cruell men,
and <hi>Eſthius</hi> thinkes thoſe men to be no other, but thoſe that are mentioned
in <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 9. of whom the text ſaith there, that <hi>divers were hardned, and

multitude to be gathered together, and there to ſpeake againſt him and his
doctrine, and againſt Chriſt, when all the multitude were got together, now
their malice thought that a fit opportunity to vent all their venome againſt
<hi>Paul</hi> and his doctrine, upon that the ſpirit of <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo provoked (ſaith
the text) that <hi>he departed from them, and ſeparated the diſciples:</hi> he ſaw
them deſperately ſet upon it with malice that they would take ſuch an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
ſo to ſpeake againſt him and his doctrine before the multitude; it
is thus with many, the more ſedition is raiſed, the better are their deſignes
furthered. Chriſt tells his Diſciples, <hi>Marke</hi> 16. 18. that <hi>Serpents ſhould do
them no hurt, and drinking poyſon ſhall not hurt them;</hi> yea, in the 19. of
<hi>Luke</hi> the beginning, he tells them <hi>they ſhall have power over divels;</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents
ſhall doe them no hurt, poyſon ſhall doe them no hurt, they ſhall have
power over Devils: but <hi>Mathew. 10. 17. Beware of men;</hi> they might
ſay, why bleſſed Maſter, what need we be afraid of men? Serpents ſhall do
us no hurt, we ſhall have power over Devils, and yet for all this, Chriſt bids
them <hi>take heed of men;</hi> as if there weere more danger of hurt from wicked
men, then from Devils, or from Serpents, and therefore S, <hi>Paul</hi> in the 2. of

ſo the words are, that thoſe that had loſt the very principle of reaſon, and
were even as beaſts. There are a generation riſen up amongſt us, who have
ſucked up the poyſon of the old Serpent, and are ſweld with it, who are ſet
on fire of hel, and the poyſon of Aſps is under their lips, and in their hands,
and as it was ſaid of <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Romus,</hi> the founders of Rome, they were
ſuckled by woolves, ſo are theſe, who deſire to build up Rome againe;
much like the firſt founders of that Rome, they ſeeme to be men ſuckled
by wolves, or as the Poets faine of <hi>Lycaon,</hi> turned into a wolfe for his cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty;
or as it is ſaid of their S. <hi>Dominick,</hi> that was the Father of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicans,
that when his Mother was with child of him, ſhe dreamed that
ſhe brought forth a wolfe, with a firebrand in his mouth; according to that
repreſentation ſhe had in her dream of her childe, ſhe proved afterwards;
and if we look to the cruelty, and the rage of theſe kind of men, we may e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
think, that their Mothers have brought forth wolves with firebrands in
their mouths; in theſe Satan rages, and we hope therefore his time is but
very ſhort, becauſe he rages ſo much; had they prevailed, and brought all
under their power, no Chronicle of any Nation under Heaven would afford
the like ſtories of horrid cruelties, as the Chronicles of theſe times would
have done; where they have prevailed, in Ireland, there have beene the
beginnings of ſuch barbariſmes, as here would have riſen to the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all rage and horrible cruelties; they may be faire a little while, till
they get more ſtrength; but certainly had they their will, there would
never be parallel examples of that horrible rage and cruelty as you would
finde among them, the Lord deliver us from being ſcourged with theſe
Scorpions; let us humble our ſoules before God, that God may not
humble us before ſuch beaſts, that we may not ſay that England ſhall

be as a forreſt, and theſe beaſts ſhall devoure them; in the meane time let us
not be offended at their prevailing in ſome places, for then we ſhould be as
beaſts our ſelves, <hi>Pſal. 73. 22. So ignorant was I, I was as a beaſt before

the blood of his people,</hi> Certainly, God will require of theſe beaſts, the blood
that hath been ſhed, it is precious blood that they have drunke; had it beene
corrupt blood, God would not ſo much have cared for it, but it hath beene
the blood of his Saints; let us believe that God will turne <hi>the rage of man,</hi>
the rage of beaſts, <hi>to his praiſe, Pſal.</hi> 76. 10. Surely the Lord cannot poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
behold without indignation ſuch vile beaſts to worrie his Lambs, who

               <p>I will viſit upon them the dayes of <hi>Baalim;</hi> in the plurall number <hi>Baalim,</hi>
by which ſome think and that not improbably, that it is meant of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Gods that they had, which they called <hi>Baalims,</hi> for the Heathen had
their chiefe Gods, and their <hi>Dii minores,</hi> their leſſer Gods, that were unto
them, as mediators to their chiefe Gods, and ſo our Papiſts have, they have
their <hi>Diiminores,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Papiſts like Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.</note> leſſer Gods, who are tutelar Gods, either over Nations,

of the Heathens, <hi>Baal,</hi> or in the Caldee dialect <hi>Bel,</hi> was the King of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon
after <hi>Nimrod,</hi> the firſt that was deified, and reputed as a God after
death, whence thoſe men that were deified after their death, and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
as Gods, as the Papiſts worſhip their Saints, they called <hi>Baalims,</hi> as
from <hi>Iulius Caeſar,</hi> the other that followed after, were called <hi>Caeſars:</hi> This
interpretation gives unto us much light to underſtand that Scripture that
you have in the firſt of the <hi>Corinthians, 8. 5. 6. Though there be that are
called Lords whether in heaven or in earth, as there be Gods many, &amp; Lords
many, but to us there is but one God the Father, and one Lord Ieſus Chriſt;</hi>
If the Apoſtle had ſpoke in Hebrew, it would have been thus, though there be
<hi>many Baalims,</hi> there is to us <hi>but one God, and one Baal;</hi> for in Hebrew, <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi>
is <hi>Lood,</hi> there are <hi>many Gods,</hi> (ſay they) there were divers greater Gods,
and there were <hi>many Lords,</hi> many <hi>Baalims,</hi> that is, there are many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the Heathens that are mediators to their other chiefe Gods; <hi>But to
us</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>there is but one God, and but one Lord,</hi> but one <hi>Baal,</hi> we have
not <hi>Baalims,</hi> wee have not many mediators, to mediate between us and
God, but as we have but one God, ſo we have but one Lord, but one Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator,
who indeed in regard of his humane nature is inferiour to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:42662:174"/>
but yet ſuch a Lord by whom are all things, and we by him, we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
not greater Gods, and leſſe Gods: the Papiſts acknowledge
but one God, but they have many Lords, many Mediatours, many that
muſt be between God and them, but this is a heatheniſh opinion.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Baalim</hi> in the plurall number. Another reaſon given by ſome,
and not improbably, is, that in regard of the ſeverall images they had of
their <hi>Baal,</hi> in ſeverall places, even in their private houſes; for Idolaters
would not ſatisfie themſelves in worſhipping their Gods in publicke, but
would worſhip them in their private houſes alſo.</p>
               <p>Now though the Jewes had onely two Idols ſet up, one in <hi>Dan,</hi> another
in <hi>Bethel;</hi> yet they had ſome repreſentations of thoſe images in their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
houſes, which may be grounded upon that text <hi>Hoſea 10. 5. Becauſe of
the calves of Bethaven,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">We muſt worship God in our private houſes.</note> that is of <hi>Bethel,</hi> calves of <hi>Bethel.</hi> Why, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
calves were there? there was but one calfe ſet up there, and yet here it is
in the plurall number: now the reaſon of that is given, becauſe though there
was but one calfe ſet up for the publicke worſhip, yet they had in their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
families, the picture of that calfe, and ſo would bring the worſhip of
their <hi>Baal</hi> into their families. A good leſſon for Chriſtians, not to ſatisfie
themſelves with publicke worſhip, but to bring as much of the worſhip of
God as they can into their families. <hi>Wherein ſhe burnt incenſe to them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Incenſe was a typicall ſignification of prayer, in two reſpects. Firſt, in the
ſweet ſavour of it. And ſecondly, in the aſcending of it by fire, ſo all our
prayers ſhould be as incenſe, ſweet before the Lord, and aſcend up with the
fervency of zeale, and Faith; it is properto God alone to have incenſe burnt
unto him in a religious way, the heathens burnt incenſe to their Idols, imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

Certainly there are deepe thoughts of God upon the heart of this
man, there was a time indeed he walked lightly; vainly, fooliſhly, but now
he is ſerious in his way, he is conſiderate, he is heavenly, he walks with feare;
Certainly there are great impreſſions of the divine Majeſty upon his heart;
if it be ſo with us, how joyfull will it be to us hereafter, when God ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
in his glory, then to have our conſciences tell us, the impreſſions of
the Majeſty of this God, that now I ſee ſo high and great have beene upon
my ſoul, in the whole courſe of my life, I now ſee the glory of the great

It is a wonder that God ſhould ever thinke of us, who are ſo forgetfull of
him as we are; <hi>Pſalm 8. What is man that thou remembreſt him?</hi> (ſaith

in the riches of free grace to make ſuch an inference, therefore let us take

from the greatneſſe of ſin againſt Gods mercy, and the prophane heart
makes his <hi>therefore</hi> from the greatneſſe of Gods mercy, to the hardening of

               <p>Againe, further, <hi>I will allure,</hi> that is, I will come upon them even una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares,
and as it were ſteale away their hearts, by a holy guile; as S. <hi>Paul</hi>
tells us, that he <hi>caught the Corinthians as it were by guile.</hi> I will ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
inſinuate my ſelfe unto them, and I will draw their hearts in ſuch a
ſweet way, in ſuch a ſecret hidden way, that I will take them before they
are aware.</p>
               <p>So it is with many a ſoule; God takes it before it is aware, though it is
true, that afterward the ſoul comes to underſtand things more clearely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Gods grace, but at the firſt, God hath taken the heart even almoſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it thinks of him. Indeed the ſinner ſees himſelfe, he is not where he was
before, ſurely there hath been here ſomething working upon my heart; I
finde it otherwiſe with me now then it hath beene, but how this comes to
paſſe, I ſcarce underſtand for the preſent, but ſhall underſtand more; like
that expreſſion we have in the 6. of <hi>Canticles, ver. 12. Ore ever I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware,
my ſoule made me as the chariot of Aminadib:</hi> That is, the chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots
of a willing people, ſo the word <hi>Aminadib</hi> ſignifies. My heart was
caught, and run amaine to God, and this was before ever I was aware, there
came ſuch wayes of Gods grace into my heart more then I thought of, and
caught my ſoul, that my ſoul run mighty freely, ſwiftly after the Lord, and
this is a bleſſed deceit, when the heart is ſo deceived, ſo allured, ſo enticed;
As ſometimes it is with an Adulterer, he doth but give a glance of his adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous
eye, and catcheth the Adultereſſe before ſhe is aware; it may be ſhe
never thought of any ſuch thing; but there is a glance of an uncleane eye that
catcheth the heart ſecretly. Thus with Chriſt, hee ſometimes gives ſuch a
glance of his eye upon the heart of a ſinner, as takes the ſinner before he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware;
the ſinner is brought in love with the wayes of God, and with the
truths of God, even before he thinks of it. We are to know that the grace
of God hath a ſubtilty in it, as well as the Serpent; The Scripture, <hi>Pro.</hi> 1. 4.
attributes a <hi>ſubtilty</hi> to Gods grace; It is a bleſſed thing to be thus out-ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilled,
(as I may ſo ſpeake) for the grace of God to be too ſubtile for our
ſins; As I remember <hi>Luther,</hi> when he was charged for Apoſtacy, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
it, (ſaith he) I confeſſe I am an Apoſtate, but how? an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
from the devil, falling off from the devill, &amp; returning unto God, ſuch
an Apoſtate I am; So many a mans heart may be deceived, but if he can
ſay, Bleſſed be God, I am deceived indeed, but ſo deceived that my ſin is
beguiled; I am ſeduced, but it is out of the wayes of ſin, into the wayes of
God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="352" facs="tcp:42662:178"/>
Many are eaſily allured by temptations, they are preſently taken by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills
allurements, but they are very ſubtile in objecting againſt all the allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Gods grace, but he is ſubtile enough to put off the allurements of ſin
and of the devill.</p>

tongue, he tels us that Vau, that is tranſlated <hi>and,</hi> is as much as <hi>poſtquam,</hi>
after <hi>I have brought them into the wilderneſſe,</hi> and then the meaning is
thus. After I have humbled them throughly, as I did their fore-fathers in
the wilderneſſe, then will I ſpeake comfortably unto them: God humbled
their forefathers in Egypt, yet that was not enough, hee humbled them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
in the wilderneſſe, and then he brought them into <hi>Canaan;</hi> many
times God brings one affliction after another upon his own people to break
their hearts, to humble them throughly, and at laſt he ſpeaks comfortably
to them. It hath been ſo with us, the Lord not many yeares ſince brought
us into bondage, it might have humbled us, &amp; broke our hearts before him;
but when wee began to bee delivered a little out of our bondage, the Lord
brings us into the wilderneſſe, and follows us with afflictions to this day, that
he might throughly break us, and yet we hope all this while, it is but making
way unto Canaan.</p>
               <p>But in the ſecond place, take it as you have it here, <hi>I will allure her and
bring her into the wilderneſſe.</hi> Then wee may take the ſcope of it to be not
the afflicting part of the wilderneſſe, but only the manifeſting this unto Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
that he would ſhew unto them great &amp; wonderfull works of his power,
&amp; wiſdome, and goodneſs, as he did unto their forefathers in the wilderneſſe.
What ever your conditions ſhall be into which you ſhal be brought, yet you
ſhall have me working in a glorious way for your good and comfort, as ever
I did for your forefathers when they were in the wilderneſſe: and this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
is rather ſtrengthened from that we have <hi>ex Thargum Ionathae,</hi>

We may read the ſtories of Gods wonderfull power in deliverances of his
people in their ſtraits in the wilderneſſe, and make them to be our own, and
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:42662:178"/>
pleade with God, that he would ſhew forth that old, that ancient power,
and wiſdom, and goodneſſe of his, as he did unto his people formerly,<note place="margin">Gods for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer wayes towards his people, great helps to our Faith.</note> this
is the ground of that excellent prayer, that we have <hi>Eſay 51. 9. 10. Awake,
awake, put on ſtrength O arme of the Lord, awake as in the ancient dayes,
in the generations of old; Art thou not it that haſt cut Rahab, and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Dragon? Art thou not it that hath dryed the ſea, the waters of the
great ſea?</hi> Awake, awake, thou art he who haſt done ſuch great things for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly;
it is a great help to our Faith to conſider what God hath done for
the Church of old.</p>
               <p>But further, <hi>Poreus</hi> ſaith this expresſion is taken from the condition of a
poor man that is drawne aſide out of his way by a thief, a thief comes and
entices him out of his way, and carries him into ſome deſolate place, &amp; when
he hath carried him thither, then the manbegins to bethink himſelf, where
he is, and ſees himſelf in a ſad condition, and knows not what in the world to
do, and yet at that time there comes in ſupply, comfort, and help for him; ſo
(ſaith God) I will bring you into the wilderneſſe, that is, <hi>I</hi> will put you into
the ſame condition, that ſuch a poor man is put into, <hi>I</hi> will allure you, as the
thief allures, <hi>I</hi> will make proffer to you of abundance of good, and by that
<hi>I</hi> will draw you into ſuch and ſuch wayes, wherein you ſhall meet with very
great ſtraits, for a while, and you ſhall be put into an amazed condition, as
not knowing what in the world to do, and when that is done, then <hi>I</hi> will
come with the fulneſſe of my grace, and ſpeake comfortably to your hearts.</p>
               <p>Thus though God ſpeakes of bringing into the wilderneſſe, yet ſtill it is
with an intention of ſhewing mercy there; and is not this juſt to a very haire
for all the world our condition? have not the ways of God toward England
for theſe two or three years been alluring wayes? God hath made proffer
unto us of a great deale of mercy, and raiſed the hopes of his people, and the
Miniſters of God have ſpoken encouraging words to his people, that ſurely
the Lord intends great goodneſſe to us, and becauſe Gods wayes have been
ſuch towards us, as they have been, we have endeavoured (God knowes) to
follow him in thoſe ways of his, to do that, that for the preſent thoſe preſent
ways of his called for: and yet we are even brought into the wilderneſs now,
even into a kind of deſolate condition,<note place="margin">When God brings into trouble: there is comfort in that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> that for the preſent we even are at a
ſtand, &amp; we ſee afflictions to be round about us, &amp; the very beaſts to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to come &amp; teare us, and pull us in pieces, and yet we can ſay to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of our hearts, Lord, if we be deceived, thou haſt deceived us, for (Lord)
thou knoweſt that whatſoever we have done, it was our duty to doe, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
we be brought into great ſtraits, for the preſent, yet we repent not of
what we have done, nor of what we have ſaid, for thou haſt allured us into
this condition, thy gracious wayes of mercy towards us in the beginning
of the Parliament, and ſo on hath allured us, and hath brought us into what
we have done. Wee will not therefore ſay, what is now become of all
our hopes? but wee expect God even in this wilderneſſe, to ſpeake
comfortably unto us, let not men upbrayde us for what wee have done,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:42662:179"/>
we would doe as we have done, if it were to do again, for God hath brought
us into theſe wayes, and if <hi>he hath allured us into the wilderneſſe,</hi> the next
words ſhall be made good unto us, <hi>he will ſpeake comfortably to us:</hi> if we
be in no other then that wilderneſſe he hath allured us into, then we may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
fully that he will ſpeake comfortably to us.</p>
               <p>Here is the difference betweene men bringing themſelves into trouble; or
being brought by the Devils or worlds allurements, and by Gods. In the
one we cannot expect comfort, but in the other we may confidently.</p>
               <p>Further, There is yet another interpretation that <hi>I</hi> think is moſt genuine,
and full; For the ground of that <hi>I</hi> ſhall ſay in this, we muſt know that
from the beginning of this part of the Chapter to the end, God is expreſſing
himſelfe unto his people in a conjugall way; that is, whereas his people had
gone a whoring from him, yet he would receive them againe into a conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall
affection, and communion: all along God expreſſes himſelf thus, from
the fourteenth verſe to the end. Now this being laid for a ground; In this
expreſſion of Gods bringing into the wilderneſſe, the Prophet alludes
unto the cuſtome of the Jewes, that they had in their marriages. Their
cuſtome that I reade of, was, that the Bride-groom uſed to take his Bride,
and carry her out of the City, into the fields, and there they had their nup ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
ſongs, and delighted themſelves in ſome place there, one with another, &amp;
afterward he brought her back againe, leaning upon him, into the City, to
his Fathers houſe, and there they rejoyced together, and ſolemnized the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
nuptials: now theſe fields are called the <hi>wilderneſſe,</hi> either becauſe they
might be ſome champion dry fields that were about the City; or otherwiſe,
let them be what they will be, yet becauſe he would allude unto the mercy of
God in bringing of his people out of Egypt, into Canaan, and would put
them in minde of that mercy of his, therefore he gives theſe fields this title,
calls them by this name, and this cuſtome of the Jews ſeemes to have war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
from Scripture it ſelf, <hi>Canticles 8. 5. Who is this that commeth up
from the wilderneſſe, leaning upon her beloved?</hi> That was the way of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
they came out of the fields, leaning upon their beloved, and ſo were
brought unto the Bridgegroomes Fathers houſe: So Chriſt brings his Spouſe
through this world, which is as the wilderneſſe, and Chriſt is here ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
his eſpouſals, and hath his nuptiall ſongs in this world; and the Church
leanes upon Chriſt, all the while ſhe is in the world, but Chriſt is carring her
to his Fathers houſe, and ere long we ſhal be with him there, ſolemnizing the
marriage of the Lambe in a more glorious way: This expreſſion goes on
clearly thus, <hi>I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderneſſe;</hi> As the
Bridegroome ſpeakes ſweet and comfortable words to his Bride, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
her abroad into the fields, and there ſolemnizes the nuptials, and ſo comes
back againe, having his Spouſe leaning upon him, and bringing her to his
Fathers houſe; ſo I will deale with you in the fulneſſe of my grace. <hi>I</hi> will
performe all the nuptiall rites with you. <hi>I</hi> will be married againe unto you,
and looke what the moſt ſolemnity in your City of Jeruſalem, or any of
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:42662:179"/>
your Cities, there is in any nuptials, <hi>I</hi> will make as great a ſolemnity in the
nuptials betweene you and me: It is true, when a marriage is ſuch as peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are loath to make it known, then there is no ſuch ſolemnity, but when it
is a great marriage indeed, and ſuch as marry together with their friends
would glory in it, then there is the more full ſolemnity; ſo ſaith God, <hi>I</hi> will
not be aſhamed to take you againe, but <hi>I</hi> will take you openly; I wil have
the ſolemnity of my marriage with you as publickly as may be, <hi>I</hi> will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
you abroad into the fields; and look what rights ſoever there are in the
moſt ſolemne marriages amongſt you, thoſe rights <hi>I</hi> will performe unto
you, that it may be a moſt glorious marriage ſolemnity between you and
me again: thus <hi>I will bring into the wilderneſſe, and ſpeake comfortably
unto them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſpeake comfortably to her.</p>

to her, either ſo as to prevaile with her heart, or ſpeake to her ſo as to do her
good at the very heart: Many Scriptures may be brought to ſhew, that
ſpeaking kindly, friendly, or comfortably, the Hebrews expreſſe by <hi>ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the heart; I</hi> will give you two or three inſtances, <hi>Geneſis 34. 3. She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem
ſpake kindly to the Damoſell,</hi> the words are in the Hebrew, <hi>Shechem
ſpake to the heart of the Damoſell;</hi> So <hi>Ruth 2. 13. Thou haſt comforted
me, for that thou haſt ſpoken friendly to thy handmaid;</hi> thou haſt <hi>ſpoken to
the very heart of thy handmaid;</hi> there are two more remarkable places for
this, one is <hi>Eſay 40. 2. Speak comfortably to Jeruſalem,</hi> the words are, <hi>ſpeak
to the heart of Jeruſalem;</hi> What ſhould be ſpoke to the heart of Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem?
<hi>Cry unto her, her warefare is accompliſhed, her iniquity is pardoned;</hi>
Theſe are the comfortable words that God required ſhould be ſpoke to the
heart of Jeruſalem: O that God would ſpeak thus to England! this would
do good at the very heart, if God would ſpeake thus from heaven, <hi>Her ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
is pardoned, and her warefare is accompliſhed.</hi> But yet a place that is
more ſuitable unto this expreſſion in the text, it is <hi>Iudges</hi> 19. 3. There you
have the ſtory of a Levite, whoſe wife having played the harlot, yet he was
willing to be reconciled to her, &amp; the text ſaith, <hi>that he went &amp; ſpake friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to her;</hi> Now the words are in the Hebrew, <hi>Hee went and ſpake to her
heart;</hi> And indeed it is a word to the heart of an adulterous ſpouſe, if her
heart be humbled, when ſhe knows that her husband will be willing not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
her playing the harlot to be reconciled to her, this was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of Iſrael, who had gone a whoring from God, yet when God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
a renewall of the marriage rites he ſaith he will ſpeake to her heart; from
whence we might obſerve this note.<note place="margin">Obſer</note> That an Apoſtatizing people, or an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtate
ſoul, had need have words of comfort ſpoke to their hearts, or elſe
there can be little eaſe to their terrified conſciences. We read of <hi>Spira</hi> that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Apoſtate, he had words of comfort enough ſpoke to his eare, but they
did him little good, God did not come in and ſpeak to his heart, therefore
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:42662:180"/>
his conſcience could not be quieted, the throbs of it could not be eaſed: How
many lie under the troubles of an accuſing conſcience,<note place="margin">Nothing can eaſe a troubled conſcience but Gods ſpeaking to the heart.</note> and have the throbs
and bitings of a guilty ſpirit, becauſe they have been back-ſliders from the
truth; and though they come to Sermons, one after another, &amp; hear the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of grace opened to them in the fulneſſe of it, &amp; the riches of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
ſet before them in the beauty of it, yet they goe away without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
why the words come to the eare, God all this time ſpeaks not to the
heart; ſometimes it pleaſes God to take but the hint of a truth, and dart it
upon the heart of a troubled ſinner, that he feeleth it at the heart, and ſayes,
Well, this day God hath ſpoken to my heart, ſo he goes away rejoycing,
eaſed, comforted, pacified; when as perhaps ſuch an one had heard a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Sermons before, wherein there were bleſſed and glorious truths preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to him, and it did no good untill Gods time; and when the time of Gods
love is come, ſome little hint of a piece of a truth God darteth to the hearts
and that doth the thing. God ſhews hereby that it is not in the word of man
to comfort an afflicted conſcience.</p>
               <p>Hence an expresſion <hi>Luther</hi> hath in his Comment upon <hi>Geneſis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Multo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficilius eſt conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am cenſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri quam martuos excitare. <hi>Luther.</hi>
                  </note> It is
far harder to comfort an afflicted conſcience, then to raiſe the dead; you
think it is nothing to Apoſtatize from the Lord, you thinke it is eaſie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
comfort, you will find it is not ſo eaſie, you will find it as eaſie to raiſe
the dead as to comfort your afflicted conſciences. But you told us before,
how rich the grace of God was, that God tooke advantage from the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of our ſins, to ſhew the riches and greatneſs of his mercy: grant it, let
the grace of God be never ſo rich, but till this grace be applyed to the heart,
till God be pleaſed to ſpeak himſelf to the heart of a ſinner, it will not do. I
remember a ſtory of one who had made profesſion of Religion, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Apoſtatiſed and made little of it, when his acquaintance told him that
thoſe things he now did he would ſmart for one day, he thought becauſe he
had ſome knowledg in the Goſpel, that it was <hi>but to believe in Jeſus Chriſt,
Jeſus Chriſt came to pardon ſinners,</hi> &amp;c. when he came upon his ſick bed,
he was in great torment of conſcience,<note place="margin">Falſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying comfort will not hold.</note> and grievous vexation, and cryed out
bitterly of his Apoſtacy, there came ſome of his acquaintance to him, and
ſpake words of comfort, and tells him that <hi>Chriſt came to ſave ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and he muſt truſt in Gods mercy, &amp;c.</hi> At length he begins to cloſe
with this, and to apply this to himſelf, and to have a little eaſe, upon which
his companions began to be hardned in their ways, becauſe they ſaw after
ſo ill a life it was ſo eaſie a matter to have comfort; but not long before he
dyed, he brake out roaring, in a moſt miſerable anguiſh, <hi>O</hi>! (ſaith hee) <hi>I
have prepared a plaiſter, but it will not ſticke, it will not ſticke:</hi> wee ſhall
find though the grace of God be rich, and the ſalve be a ſoveraign un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
God be pleaſed to make it ſtick by ſpeaking to our hearts, nothing can
be done. <hi>From hence further, learn this note.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As when God ſpeaks comfortably to his people,<note place="margin">Obſ.</note> he ſpeaks to their hearts:
ſo Gods Miniſters, when they come to ſpeak in Gods name, ſhould labour
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:42662:180"/>
to ſpeak ſo, as to do what they can to ſpeak to hearts. It is true indeed, it is
imposſible that any man of himſelfe can ſpeake to the heart of another, but
yet he may endeavour, and aime that way, there is a kind of ſpeaking that
God doth aſſiſt, ſo as to bring it to the heart of his people.</p>
               <p>What ſpeaking is that? you will ſay.</p>
               <p>That that cometh from the heart, will moſt likely go to the heart, though
I know God can take that which comes but from the lips, and carry it to the
heart when he pleaſes, yet ordinarily that that comes from the heart, goes
to the heart, therefore Miniſters when they come to ſpeak the great things of
the Goſpel, they ſhould not ſeeke ſo much for brave words, and enticing
ways of mans wiſdome, but let them get their own hearts warmed with that
grace of the Goſpel, and then they are moſt like to ſpeak to the hearts of their
Auditors. It is a good note that I have met with from <hi>Ribera,</hi> let Miniſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
remit (ſaith he)
of their care of fine
curious words,<note place="margin">Remittant aliquid de cura nit<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

they ſpeake with the tongues of men and Angels,</hi> they ſhall <hi>become but like
the ſounding braſſe, and the tinckling cymball:</hi> this is an expreſſion even of
a Jeſuite, it were then a great ſhame that Gods Miniſters ſhould not labour
to ſpeak ſo, as that they may ſpeak to the hearts of people: you muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
of ſuch kind of preaching as you find ſpeaks to your hearts, not that
that comes meerly to your eares: how many men love to have the word
jingle in their ears, and in the mean time their hearts go away, and not one
word ſpoke to them? but when you finde a Miniſtry ſpeake to your hearts,
cloſe with it, bleſs God for it, and count it a ſadd day when you goe from a
Sermon, and there is not one word ſpoke to your hearts in that Sermon.</p>
               <p>From the connection of theſe two, <hi>I will bring them into the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi>
&amp; <hi>ſpeak unto their hearts:</hi> if we ſhould take <hi>the wilderneſſe</hi> for brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
into affliction (<hi>becauſe there are ſo many interpreters that are very
godly men, &amp; learned men, go that way</hi>) I dare not wholy reject it, but that
there may be ſome intention that way.</p>
               <p>Hence the firſt note is,</p>
               <p>Afflictions make way for Gods word to the hearts of ſinners;<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> there are
many <hi>obſtructions</hi> at the hearts of men while they are in <hi>proſperity,</hi> but
when afflictions come, God by them opens thoſe <hi>obſtructions,</hi> and ſo gets
his word to their hearts; afflictions cannot convert the heart, but they can
take away ſome <hi>obſtructions</hi> that did hinder the word from coming to the
heart. Many of you have heard thouſands of Sermons, and ſcarce know
of any one that hath come to your hearts, but when God caſts you upon
your ſicke beds, and you apprehend death, then you feele the ſame truthes,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:42662:181"/>
that you were not ſenſible of before, they lie upon your hearts, the threatning
word of God, that went but to the ear before, now it is got to the heart, now
it terrifies, now you cry out of your ſins, and relliſh the ſweet promiſes of
the Goſpel that afflictions make way for. I remember an expreſſion that I
have read of <hi>Bernard,</hi> he had once to a brother of his, who was a Souldier,
but riotous and prophane, <hi>Bernard</hi> gives him many good inſtructions,
wholſome admonitions, and counſels, his brother ſeemed to ſlight them,
he made nothing of them, <hi>Bernard</hi> comes to him, and puts his hand to his
ſide; <hi>one day</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>God will make way to this heart of yours, by ſome
ſpeare, or launce,</hi> he meant God would wound him in the Wars, and ſo hee
would open a way to his heart, and then his admonitions ſhould get to his
heart, and as he ſaid, ſo it fell out; for going into the Wars, he was woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and then he remembers his brothers admonitions, they got to, and lay
upon his heart to purpoſe. It God ſhould let the enemy in upon us, their
ſwords or bullets may make way to our hearts, that ſo Gods word may
come to have entrance there, the Lord rather pierce our hearts by his ſpirit,
then that way to our hearts ſhould be made thus.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Obſer.</hi> Times of affliction Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting times.</note> when we are brought to great affliction, that is the time for
Gods mercies. This ſhould make us not to be ſo afraid of afflictions, how
afraid are we? how do we hang back when we ſee afflictions coming? why
art thou ſo loth, O thou Chriſtian, to come to affliction! the time of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is the time for God to ſpeake to the heart of a ſinner; many ſinners may
ſay that their condition hath been like <hi>Jacobs,</hi> he never had a more ſweete
viſion of God, then when he lay abroad in the fields, with no other pillow
under his head then a ſtone, it may be God will take away all your outward
comforts, and when they are all gone, then may be Gods time to ſpeake
comfortably to your heart.</p>

all the clutter of the world, that they enjoyed, and were ſnared by in their
owne Countrey, and ſo he will carry them aſide into deſolate places, and
there he will inſtruct them, when he hath got them as it were alone; That
hath been Gods way in making himſelf known unto his people, whom hee
hath had a love unto, to draw them aſide from the clutter of the world,
from their engagements, and there to ſpeak to their hearts. We have a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous

here in our owne land, while we have our eſtates, and all well about us, wee
are ſcarce fit to hearken what God hath to ſay to us: Many of Gods people
have found it by experience, that whereas there were many truths of God,

were not; but when <hi>God</hi> took them aſide from their engagements, and from

into ſome remote places, where the glory of their own Countrey did not ſo

               <p>Perhaps God hath given thee an eſtate in the world, more then thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors,
more then thy brother; But hath God ſpoke to thy heart? Are Gods
blesſings upon thee as a fruit of Gods ſpeaking to thy heart, in away of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation

               <p>I will reſtore unto you your vineyards <hi>from thence:</hi> From whence? From

               <p>God can bring vineyards out of wilderneſſes.<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> Let us not be afraid, onely
let us make up our peace with God, and then though we be in a wilderneſs,
God can from thence bring us vineyards. Our brethren have found vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards

dravv mercies out of thoſe things that were unlikely, he will bring forth good

               <p>Thoſe mercies that come to us out of great difficulties,<note place="margin">Obſer</note> and ſeeme to be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
out of contraries, are the ſweet mercies indeed, thoſe we are to rejoyce
in; and therefore it followes, <hi>and they ſhall ſing. Deut. 32. 13. God made
them to ſuck honey out of the rock, and oyle out of the flinty rock;</hi> When did
God doe ſo? where did you ever reade, that God did cauſe his people to

<hi>that the rock was ſmote,</hi>

                  <hi>and the water did guſb out of it,</hi> but when did we
reade that ever oyle or honey came out of the rock? there was never any
ſuch thing that we reade of; but the meaning thereof is, becauſe they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in neceſſity, God brought forth water, yet being brought out of the rock
by ſuch a mighty hand of God, it was <hi>oyle,</hi> it was <hi>honey</hi> to them, it was as
good as if God had given them <hi>oyle</hi> and <hi>honey;</hi> Why? becauſe it came out
of ſo much difficulty: So all the mercies that God gives to his people, when
he brings them out of difficulties and ſtraits, they are ſweet and glorious
mercies. Let us be patient a while, though we ſeeme to be in the wilderneſs,
and we ſee nothing to fetch out water from, but onely rocks, ſtones, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties,
yet God at length will bring mercies out of thoſe difficulties, and
they will be honey mercies to us, then we ſhall ſing and praiſe the name of
our God with joyfull hearts.</p>

                        </gap> the valley of</hi> Achor was a doore of hope.</note> becauſe it was the firſt place wherein they tooke the poſſesſion of
Canaan, when they began to have outward means of ſubſtance, to eate of
the corne of the land, all the while they were in the wilderneſs although God
provided wonderfully for them, by ſending them Manna from Heaven, yet
becauſe they had no way of ſubſtance by ordinary means, they always fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
leſt they ſhould want upon any ſtrait they were brought into, their hearts
began to ſinke. Now in this valley God gives them outward means, &amp; this
raiſes hope in them, that their danger was over, and that they ſhould do well
enough.</p>
               <p>This is our nature when ordinary means fayle, our hearts fayle, yea
though in regard of Gods extraordinary workings, we have never ſo
many gracious encouragements, and when God grants means againe, then
we hope. Secondly, God made their great trouble there a means of much
good unto them, for by that they were brought to purge their Campe, they
learned to feare the Lord, and were prepared more then before, for ſo great
a mercy as the further poſſesſion of that good land. The <hi>Septuagint</hi> inſtead

               <p>But how ſhould this <hi>valley of Achor</hi> be <hi>a doone of hope</hi> to Iſrael in after
times?<note place="margin">Queſt.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Anſw. 1</note> the Jews think that Iſrael ſhall return into their own country againe,
yea and the ſame way, they ſhall come again into Canaan by that valley
which ſhall be a door of hope to them.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2.</note> but rather by way of Analogy, as God turned this valley of
trouble to much good unto them, ſo he would turn all the ſore afflictions of
<hi>Iſrael</hi> in after dayes to their great advantage, grievous afflictions ſhould
make way for glorious mercies.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3.</note> But eſpecially thus, in this expreſſion, God followes the Allegory
of marriage; now it was the cuſtome of the Jewes in their marriages, that
the Husband gave his Spouſe according to his quality, as a dowry, ſome
peece of ground, rich as he was able, and this he gave as a pledge of his love
to her, to aſſure her that whatſoever was his, ſhe ſhould have the benefit of
it; ſo ſaith the Lord, although you have gone a whoring from me, and may
juſtly expect that I ſhould for ever reject you, yet I will marry you to my
ſelfe, and I will fully perform all marriage rights for the expresſion of my
love towards you to the uttermoſt, you ſhall know that you are marryed to
a Husband who is rich, I will give you a rich and plentifull dovvry, and this
but as a token and pledg of further love, mercy, riches, that you ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
by me, it ſhall be that valley of <hi>Achor,</hi> that rich, delightfull, fruitfull
valley. By this he means he would beſtow ſome ſpeciall choiſe mercy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, at his firſt taking them into his favour again, and that ſhould be a
pledg of, and making way to much more mercy, that he intended for them a
doore of hope to let in greater things, as the firſt fruits of all thoſe glorious
things that he had treaſured up for them.<note place="margin">Obſer.</note>
               </p>
               <p>From this <hi>valley of Achor,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Obſer. 1.</note> as it concerned <hi>Iſrael</hi> before.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Sometimes when God gives men their hearts deſires, when they
think themſelves happy, as if all trouble were paſt, then he comes in upon
them with great and ſore afflictions.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Obſer. 2.</note> although God hath been humbling mens hearts with ſore and
long afflictions, yet juſt before he beſtows great mercies, he afflicts againe,
to humble and break their hearts yet more.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Obſer. 3.</note> ſin will make the pleaſanteſt place in the world, a place of trouble.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Obſer. 4.</note> the afflictions of the Saints do not only go before mercies, but
are doors of hope to let in to mercies, means to further the way for mercies.
God commands light to ſhine not only after darkneſſe, but out of darkneſs.
<hi>Joſephs</hi> priſon, <hi>Davids</hi> perſecution, <hi>Daniels</hi> den, made way for glorious
mercy God had in ſtore for them; that which once <hi>The miſtocles</hi> ſaid to his
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:42662:184"/>
children and friends, the Saints may much more ſay to theirs, <hi>I had beene
undone,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Picrem niſi periiſſem.</note> 
                  <hi>if I had not been undone;</hi> had it not been for ſuch a grieyous affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
I had never come to the enjoyment of ſuch a mercy. Hence we muſt
learn not only to be patient in tribulation, but joyfull.</p>
               <p>But the eſpeciall thing intended in this expreſſion is this:<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> When God is
reconciled to his people, then preſent mercies are doors of hope to let in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
mercies; the Saints may look upon all mercies received as in-lets to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mercies to be received. Every mercy a door to another mercy, and all
mercies here put together, are a door to eternall mercy. When <hi>Rachel</hi> had
a ſonne ſhe called his name <hi>Joſeph, Gen.</hi> 30. 24. ſaying, <hi>The Lord ſhall add
to me another ſonn.</hi> Every mercy the Saints have may well be called <hi>Ioſeph,</hi>
it brings aſſurance of mercy to be added, this is the high priviledge of the
Saints: every mercy that a wicked man hath, he may look upon as his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt,
as his all, he may write a <hi>ne plus ultra</hi> upon it; one miſery, one judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon a wicked man makes way toanother, but not one mercy: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
God in his bounty may lengthen out mercies to him, yet it is more
then he can expect, he rather hath cauſe to wonder he hath ſo much, then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
more, but God ever draws out his loving kindneſſe to his Saints. <hi>Pſal.</hi>
36. 10. <hi>Draw out thy loving kindneſſe unto them that know thee, and thy
righteouſneſſe to the upright in heart.</hi> Firſt, the good that others have from
God is bounty, patience, but that which the Saints have is loving kindneſſe.
Secondly, that which others have is no ways tied to them by promiſe, but
that which the Saints have they have by promiſe. it is righteouſneſs, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 23.
<hi>Thou makeſt me lye down in green paſture, thou anointeſt my head with
freſh oyle, my cup runneth over.</hi> Here is a great deal, but is here all? no, ver.
6. <hi>ſurely mercy &amp; goodneſſe ſhall follow me all the dayes of my life.</hi> That we
read of <hi>David, 2 Sam.</hi> 5. 12. is very obſervable, from Gods proſpering him
in his preſent way, he draws an argment to confirm him in the aſſurance for
the future, that his Kingdome was eſtabliſhed to him, why? did not <hi>Saul</hi>
proſper at the beginning of his raign as well as <hi>David?</hi> &amp; yet it was no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of his eſtabliſhment; but <hi>David</hi> could ſee Gods mercy coming to him
after another manner then <hi>Saul</hi> could, all mercies the Saints have come from
the covenant in which there is a rich treaſure of mercies, a bleſſed connexion
of the mercies. The covenant between <hi>David</hi> &amp; <hi>Ionathan</hi> was, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20.
15. <hi>That loving kindnes muſt not be cut off from the houſe of Ionathan.</hi> The
covenant between God and the Saints is, that loving kindneſſe ſhall never
be cut off from them, but the links of mercies ſhall be faſtned one to another,
ſo as they ſhall reach eternity.</p>
               <p>Mercies to the Saints come from love, <hi>&amp; amor neſcit nimium,</hi> love
knows no ſuch thing as exceſſe. The Saints underſtanding this miſtery in the
way of Gods grace towards them hence they follow God in ſeeking his face
then, eſpecially when he is moſt in the way of mercy; whereas the men of
the world who know not this, ſeldome ſeek after mercy, but in times of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
when God is in a way of juſtice and wrath, this is their folly.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="366" facs="tcp:42662:185"/>
Infinite reaſon there is; O ye Saints of the Lord, that one duty ſhould for
ever make way for another, ſeeing on mercy makes way for another: here
lyes a great difference between doing duties from the ſtrength of common
grace, and from ſanctifying grace: in the one the ſpirit by doing ſome things
is wearied and thinkes now it may reſt, but in the other, the very doing ſtill
encreaſeth ſtrength, and puts the heart upon doing more.</p>
               <p>But may not ſecurity promiſe continuance of mercy?<note place="margin">Queſt.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Yes,<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> but if ſo, then when affliction comes, the heart will ſinke for feares
of continuance in miſery, as well as before it hoped for continuance of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</p>
               <p>When then may we aſſure our ſelves that our mercies are doores of hope
to further mercies.<note place="margin">Queſt.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Anſ. 2,</note> When they are created mercies wrought by a more imediate hand
of God, generation may be imperfect, but creation never; <hi>omne creatum
eſt perfectum, Eſay, 26. 12. Lord thou wilt ordaine peace for us,</hi> What is
the argument? <hi>for thou haſt wrought all our workes in us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2.</note> When they are ſpirituall mercies, <hi>Ezek. 39. 29. Neither will
I hide my face any more from them,</hi> VVhat is the argument? <hi>For I have
powred forth my ſpirit upon the houſe of Iſrael;</hi> but is not this your private
opinion that this argument will hold? No, the words following are, <hi>Thus
ſaith the Lord God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3.</note> When mercies carry us to the God of mercy, and are turned
duties, as if we can turne our duties into mercies, that is, account every duty
a mercy, that is a good argument that we ſhall hold out in duty, when wee
can turne mercies into duties, that is, make every mercy an engagement to
duty, that is a good argument that mercy will hold out.</p>
               <p>But are there not interruptions many times in the wayes of Gods mercy
to his own people?<note place="margin">Object, Anſ.</note> VVe ſometimes think there is an interruption, when if
we knew all we ſhould ſee a bleſſed concatenation, but it muſt be granted
that there may ſometimes be ſome kinde of enterruption in ſuch a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.
After Iſraels returne from captivity and beginning to build the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
there were ſuch enterruptions as it was ſeventy years before it was fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed:
but though there may be enterruptions for a time, yet not a quite
breaking off, there is yet a ſtrength in the grace of the covenant that carries
the work on and perfects it at laſt; by ceaſing in one way of mercy, God
prepares for another; the very ceaſing in ſuch a way may be a mercy; we
our ſelves at this day are a ſad ſpectacle of the interruption of the wayes of
Gods mercies towards a nation.</p>
               <p>Mercy that ere while ſhined in her beauty upon us, hath now ſeemed in a
great meaſure to have withdrawn the beames of her glory; our doore of
hope that we thought to be ſo wide open, ſeems almoſt ſhut againſt us. I
dare not ſay that it is ſhut, leſt I ſhould wrong the preſent grace of God yet
continuing to us. But</p>

Secondly, And now a crowd of difficulties ſeeme even to ſtop up the
door, they come thronging ſtill to it, as if they would certainly ſtop it up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
us.<note place="margin">3.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, As the Prophet <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11. 1. 2. ſaw <hi>at the door of the gate five
and twenty men,</hi> amongſt whom there were ſome <hi>chiefe</hi> ones, <hi>who deviſed

many even of the chiefe ones, deviſing miſchiefe, and giving wicked coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,
by which they labour to ſhut, yea to lock, and bolt up this our doore of
hope.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4.</note> VVe hoped that this our door of hope would have been like
the doors that entred into the oracle, of which we read 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 6. 31. made
of the <hi>olive tree,</hi> yea <hi>the ſide-poſts and lintels were of olive tree, &amp; carvings
of palm trees &amp; cherubims,</hi> all <hi>overlaid with gold,</hi> but now our door ſeems
to be of Iron, the way to our help and mercy muſt be through the Iron gate,
we muſt get to it by ſuftering hard things.</p>
               <p>5.<note place="margin">5.</note> Our door that was wide, whereat mercy began to come flowing in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace
freely, now it ſeemes to be ſtraitened, it is now the ſtrait gate, we muſt
be content to ſtrip our ſelves of a great part of our eſtates, of many of our

               <p>6.<note place="margin">6.</note> Yea, our <hi>door-poſts</hi> are like the Iſraelites in Egypt, <hi>beſprinkled with

had we made uſe of it? That key of <hi>David</hi> that we reade of, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 3. 7.
<hi>That openeth and no man ſhutteth.</hi> This key the Church of <hi>Philadelphia</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Queſt. Anſw.</note> But what is this <hi>key of David?</hi> It is the ruling power
of Jeſus Chriſt in his Church; <hi>David</hi> in his government was a ſpeciall type
of Chriſt, the firſt godly King over his people that ever was: Government
is emblematically ſet forth by a <hi>key, Eſay,</hi> 22. 22, God promiſed <hi>Eliakim</hi>
to commit the government to him by that expreſſion, <hi>The key of the houſe
of David will I lay upon his ſhoulder, Eſay,</hi> 9. 6, 7. The government is ſaid
to be upon Chriſts ſhoulder, and he ſits upon the throne of <hi>David;</hi> that is
obſervable that to <hi>Eliakim</hi> there was promiſed, but <hi>the key of the houſe of
David;</hi> but to Chriſt <hi>the key of David himſelfe;</hi> the one was to governe
but as a ſteward, the government of the other was to be Princely. If we had
been the Church of Philadelphia, united in brotherly love, and had had this
key of <hi>David</hi> amongſt us, we might before this time had had a door ſet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:42662:186"/>
amongſt us, that no man could have ſhut againſt us; but woe unto us,
how many amongſt us ſay of Chriſt, We will not have this man to rule o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
us? Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> more then thirty years ſince paralelld this Church
of <hi>Philadelphia</hi> with the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> he made it in a typical way to
ſet forth the wayes of God towards that Church in after times; and indeed
they have been very like one another divers wayes, and God ways towards
the one hath been the ſame with his ways towards the other in many things.</p>
               <p>1. They are both <hi>Philadelphians,</hi> united ſo in a brotherly covenant, as
no Churches in any kingdome more. 2. It was ſaid of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> it had
<hi>but a little ſtrength, and yet it kept Gods word.</hi> VVhat Churches in any
Nation have beene more contemptible, then thoſe in Scotland? They have
beene accounted a poore beggerly people, deſpiſed of all, and yet God hath
enabled them to doe great things. 3. God hath <hi>cauſed their enemies to come
and bow before them,</hi> and to know that he hath loved them, even thoſe who
ſaid <hi>they were lews and were not,</hi> that they were the onely Church, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
they were <hi>the Synagogue of Satan;</hi> &amp; they have rejected falſe govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and have received much of the government of Chriſt, the key of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
is more received among them then in any kingdome in the world; no
marvaile then though their doore be ſo opened that none could ſhut it, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
Gods mercy; our Houſes of Parliament have caſt away the falſe key,
(The Lord deliver them and us) for ever medling with it any more whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
come of us. They have further profeſſed their deſires to enquire after the
true key. This door of hope we hope will open to us in due time, ſo as none
ſhall ſhut it. 9. We have loſt many opportunities for the opening this door,
never had a people fairer opportunities for mercy then we have had, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
looke back upon them without trembling hearts, we may ſee cauſe to
lament the loſſe of them with teares of blood, even this hath coſt much, and
is yet like to coſt more blood.</p>
               <p>10. Yea woe unto us, out father comes forth and ſeemes to be angry with
us, and bids ſhut the doore againſt us, yea hee ſhuts us out himſelfe; is not
that complaint of the Churches, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80, 4. truly ours, <hi>O Lord of Hoaſts
how long wilt thou be angry with the prayer of thy people?</hi> If God be angry
with out knocking, what ſhall we doe?</p>
               <p>11. And well may God bid ſhut the doore againſt us, for we have ſhut
it upon our ſelves: This our doore of hope hath a ſpring lock, it is eaſily
ſhut too, but it cannot ſo eaſily be opened againe: we have ſtood wrangling
and ſtrugling one with another, and have clapt to the doore upon our ſelves
before we were aware. That Scripture <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7. 1, is as truly ours, as ever it
was Iſraels, <hi>When I would have healed Iſrael, then the iniquity of Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im
was diſcovered, and the wickedneſſe of Samariah.</hi> VVhen the Lord
would have healed England, then the iniquity thereof hath been diſcovered
more then ever. There is the vileſt ſpirit of malignity, againſt godlineſſe,
againſt the Saints, againſt the way of Chriſt in his Ordinances, that ever
was upon the face of the earth. Now men care not though they ruin them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:42662:186"/>
though they bring themſelves and poſterity to be bondſlaves, ſo they
may but have their wills upon thoſe that are godly to ſuppreſſe them. The
controverſie now is almoſt grown to that height, that the kingdome divides
it ſelfe into thoſe who have ſome ſhew of Religion, and the haters of it. Thoſe
times complained of in <hi>Micah</hi> are even ours, <hi>Chap. 7. 5. Truſt ye not in a
friend, put no confidence in a guide, keepe the doores of thy mouth from her
that lyeth in thy boſome;</hi> Yea, it is almoſt come to that in the fourth verſe,
<hi>The beſt of them is a bryar, the moſt upright is ſharper then a thorny hedg.</hi>
There is much frowardneſſe, much perverſneſſe even in the beſt, many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
and grievous breaches even amongſt them; they cannot endure
you ſhould be jealous of them, and they give cauſe of jealouſie daily. This
generation for a great part of it, ſhew themſelves to have ſuch ſullied, ſuch
puttid ſpirits, ſo defiled with ſuperſtitious vanities, ſo imbittered with a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of malignity, that we may feare God hath no pleaſure in the generality of
it: yea <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron have ſinned,</hi> the beſt have ſo ſullied themſelves
with Antichriſtian pollutions, that juſt it were with God that <hi>this whole ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration</hi>
ſhould be firſt taken away, and that the <hi>young</hi> generation that is
comming on, who have not ſo defiled themſelves, ſhould have this doore
that lets into <hi>Canaan</hi> opened to them, that they onely ſhould goe into, and
poſſeſſe that <hi>good land,</hi> but our carcaſſes ſhould fall in the <hi>wilderneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You who are godly young ones, whoſe hearts began betimes to yerne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Jeſus Chriſt, know the heart of Jeſus Chriſt yernes after you: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
ſome of you may fall in fighting for your brethren, &amp; ſo be received
to heaven, yet you are of that generation God will open this door of mercy
unto, you ſhal go in &amp; poſſeſſe Canaan, all this valley of Achor is but a door
of hope to you; continue you on in your ſincerity, God will reveale him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
more fully to you then he hath done to us, if we be cut off before thoſe
treaſures of mercy that God has ready for his people be opened, we muſt
accept of the puniſhment of our iniquity, and even beare this indignation of
the Lord becauſe wee have ſinned againſt him. 12. Yea the Lord <hi>hath
ſtrucke us with blindneſſe</hi> at the doore, we grope up and down and we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<hi>finde it,</hi> as <hi>Gen,</hi> 19. 11. Never were a people at a greater loſſe, in a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
confuſion then now we are; every man runs his owne way, wee know
not what to doe, nay the truth is, we know not what we doe.</p>
               <p>13. Yea many becauſe they have found ſome difficulties at the right door,
they have gone away from it, and have ſought back doors to help themſelves
by, even baſe, falſe, ſhifting, treacherous ways, ſeeking to comply for their
own private ends, as if their skins muſt needs be ſaved, whatſoever becomes
of the publique.</p>
               <p>14. This is yet a further miſery, that we are groping up and downe at the
doore, and night is come upon us, ſtormes, tempeſts are riſing, dangers are
approaching, and yet God opens not to us.</p>
               <p>15. Above all our miſery this is yet the greateſt, that even our hearts are

thoſe who are the publicke inſtruments of God for our good, upon whom
ſo much of the great affayres of the kingdom, under God depends.</p>
               <p>And for the quickning of our hearts that we may doe all we can, that this
our doore of hope be not ſhut againſt us, Conſider further,</p>
               <p>Firſt, This doore was opened to us when we began to think, yea almoſt
to conclude that all doores of hope had beene ſhut againſt England, when
we were ready to give up all for loſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It was opened to us after much knocking by prayer. If ever
there were a Parliament of prayer ſince the world began, this was, and is,
How dreadfull then would it be to have this doore ſhut againſt us!</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It was opened by a mighty hand of God. <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells us of a
doore of the Temple that uſed to have thirty men to open it, and yet as a
prognoſtication of ſome great thing to fallout, it opened of its own accord:
This our door was more hard to be opened, thouſands of men could not
have opened this, it was the mighty work of God to doe it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It is a door that opens to the greateſt mercies that ever England
had: how happy would England be in the happy ſucceſs of this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment!</p>
               <p>5. It is a door that our adverſaries have laboured all they can to ſhut by
policy, and by force, and thorow Gods mercy, yet they cannot.</p>
               <p>6. How ſweet have the manifeſtations of God been to us, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of his goodneſſe, and our endeavours! <hi>Can<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and my fingers ſweet ſmelling myrrhe upon the handles of the locke,</hi> the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of reformation: but the hand upon the door is ſweet, what would
the work compleated be?</p>
               <p>7. If this doore ſhould be wholly ſhut againſt us, what a miſerable peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ſhould we be? if theſe men have their wills, then never expect Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aments
more, or never good from Parliaments, They will be the moſt
contemptible and ſervile things that can be, if any, they will be doores to let
in all miſery, to frame miſchiefe by a law; then what are we and our poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
but ſlaves? the Popiſh party muſt, yea will be gratified, their deſigne
will be effected; what contempt of the Saints, of Religion? what hatred?
what perſecution will then follow? what horrid blaſphemies? how will
they be hardned in all manner of wickedneſſe? our eſtates, our liberties, our
Religion are then gone, yea it is like our lives, and if not ſo, ſo miſerable
would our lives be, as we had better have the grave open her mouth upon
us, and we be ſhut in it, then to live to ſee, hear and feele ſuch things as we
and our friends, are like to heare, ſee, and feele.</p>
               <p>It would be the moſt horrid judgment that ever was againſt a nation, it
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:42662:188"/>
may be told to all the nations of the world, God gave England a fair oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to help it ſelf, to be a moſt happy nation, but they had no hearts, they
were blinded, their hearts were taken from them, thoſe worthies they choſe,
who ventured themſelves for them, they baſely deſerted, and betrayed, they
have alſo vilely betrayed themſelves, their liberties, their Religion, their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity,
and now are become the moſt miſerable nation, the moſt fearful ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle
of Gods wrath upon the face of the earth. Wherefore beloved in
the Lord, let us make ſure of Chriſt, who is our hope, and who ſays of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
that he is the door, as indeed hee is to let in all mercies of God into us,
that whatever diſappointment we have of our hopes here, yet we may not
be diſappointed of our laſt hopes, though it ſhould prove that here looking
for light, behold darknes, yet we looking for the light of Gods face eternally,
we may not be driven out to everlaſting darknes. But ſhall I end thus? nay
the cloſe of all ſhal rather be the cloſe of the 31 <hi>Pſal. Be of good courage and
he ſhal ſtrengthen your heart, all ye that hope in the Lord</hi> hope yet that God
will make the valley of <hi>Achor</hi> adoor of hope unto us. The next words in this
Scripture are words of joy, <hi>She ſhall ſing as in the dayes of her youth.</hi> Was
there ever a time wherein ſhee had cauſe to ſing praiſe to God? there are
times coming that ſhall be as joyfull as ever yet times have been, God hath
mercy for his people, he hath ſinging times for them.</p>

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
and <hi>to anſwer;</hi> And that I take indeed to be the meaning of the Spirit
of God, they ſhal ſing by way of anſwering: Thus, they were wont to ſing,
<hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>his praecinentibus aliis ſuccinentibus,</hi> ſome ſinging before, and ſome an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering.
So that it was not a bare ſinging, but a ſinging of a <hi>Canticum dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticum,</hi>

or ſuch a kind of ſong, as they did anſwer one another in their
ſinging. And thus (ſaith God) ſhall be the melody of my people, when I
am again reconciled to them upon their repentance, there ſhall be mutuall
ſinging, one ſinging to another, and the others anſwering in a joyfull way.</p>
               <p>The other word to be opened, is that which is tranſlated, <hi>coming up out of
the land of Egypt.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                  </note> The word you have in your books [<hi>came up</hi>] it is <hi>aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
as in the day when they aſcended up out of the land of Egypt. And wee
are to take notice of the manner of the expreſſion, becauſe it will afford to
us a profitable note anon. They aſcended out of the land of Egypt, partly
becauſe Egypt was a Countrey that lay very low, and in that reſpect they
may be ſaid <hi>to aſcend.</hi> But that is not the chiefe, they were in a low conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they were in a ſtate of bondage, and in that regard they were ſaid <hi>to
aſcend.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond thing to be ſhewed is the ſcope, what the Spirit of God aym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
at, <hi>They ſhall ſing as in the dayes of their youth, when they aſcended out
of the land of Egypt.</hi> Read it ſo, and</p>
               <p>It is a further expreſſion of the nuptiall ſolemnity that there ſhould be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and his people, in the time of their reconciliation (for ſo I have
told you formerly, that God goeth along in this ſecond part of the Chapter,
in that continued Allegory, to ſhew his bringing of his people to him in a
way of marriage, in a betrothing way, which afterward is expreſt more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
and all the way God expreſſeth it, is in the manner of Nuptiall ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities:)
As if he ſhould ſay, Marriage is an ordinance I have appointed for
mutuall joy and delight that the man and wife ſhould have one in the other,
ſo I will bring you and marry you to my ſelf, and there ſhall be a great deale
of joy that I will have in you, and you ſhall have in me; there ſhall be the
ſinging of the <hi>Epithilamium,</hi> the Nuptiall long between us; there ſhall be a
time of abundance of rejoycing between us, when I ſhall take you again to
my ſelfe. Doe you think with your ſelves, when was the greateſt time of joy
that ever you had in your lives; Know I will bring you to as much joy as
ever yet you had. Looke what mercy you had when you came out of the
land of Egypt, and rejoyced in it, you ſhall hereafter have mercies as great
as that. Did I then appear in a miraculous way to you? I will do ſo again.
Had you mercies that were promiſed long before, and rejoyced in them?
you ſhall have the like again. Had you mercies that you a long time pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for before? you ſhall have the like againe. Did <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Miriam</hi> goe
before you in ſinging, and you followed after? there ſhall be the like time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
when both Governours and people ſhall joyne together in ſinging and
prayſing the name of the Lord. This is the ſcope.</p>
               <p>The third thing is, what is meant by <hi>the dayes of their youth?</hi> The dayes
of their youth is the ſame that after wards is expreſt, and the day when they
came up out of the land of Egypt, that is, the time when they were deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out of bondage, after they had paſſed through the Red-ſea, and had ſeen
the great works of God in their deliverance, then was the day of their youth.
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:42662:190"/>
                  <hi>Jer. 2. 2. I will remember the kindneſſe of thy youth when thou followedſt
me in the wilderneſſe.</hi> The time that this people were delivered from <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roah,</hi>
and ſaw the great works of God in the wilderneſſe, is the time of their
youth, in the time of their bondage; they did not outwardly appear to be the
Lords; but when God manifeſted himſelf ſo gloriouſly in their deliverance,
then God did as it were take them again to be his people, and they did ſeem
as it were then to be born againe, and the time of their being in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
was Gods training them up as it were in their youth. For a people that
are under bondage can ſcarce be ſaid to be born, they are but as the <hi>Enbryo</hi>
at leaſt in the womb in that priſon. They cannot be ſaid to be a people when
they are under bondage, at leaſt they are not a living people. Hence <hi>Chap.</hi>
13. of this Propheſie, when they were in bondage under <hi>Jeroboams</hi> wicked
commands, the Text ſaith, <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. that they died. <hi>When Ephraim ſpake,
trembling, in Iſrael he exalted himſelfe; but when he offended in Baal, hee
dyed.</hi> A people under bondage are as a dead people; before they have their
liberty, they are to be accounted as not born; and if they loſe their liberty,
they are to be eſteemed as if they loſt their lives.</p>
               <p>But here a queſtion ariſeth. How can God have reference to this time,
and tell them they ſhall ſing as then, whereas in the beginning of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
we find that when God threatneth them, he telleth them he will ſet them
as in the day wherein they were born? ſo that to be brought to the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
they were in, is a threatning; How then is it here a promiſe?</p>
               <p>The anſwer to that is, it is true, the time when they came up out of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt
was indeed a time of much mercy, but they were in great ſtraits in
regard of externall helps, as a ſuccourleſſe, helpleſſe, and ſhiftleſſe people,
when therefore God threatneth to ſet them as in the day wherein they were
born, he only aymeth at that, that is, to bring them into a ſuccourleſs, help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
and ſhiftleſſe condition in regard of creature-helps as formerly they
were. But when God promiſes mercy, and telleth them he will bring them
into that condition they were in their youth, hee doth not conſider of their
ſuccourleſſe &amp; shiftleſſe condition, but rather looks at all the mercie they had
in their deliverance out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> As it is a great affliction for a people to be
brought into the ſame condition that once they were in, that is, to have all the
ſowr &amp; bitter without any of the ſweet, ſo it is a great priviledge for a people
to be brought into a former condition, when they shall have all the ſweet
without the ſowr, when God shal take away all the branne, &amp; give them only
the flowr, ſtrain out all that is evil, &amp; give them all that is good, that is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
condition; but when God shall ſtrain out what is good, and give
them what is evill, that is a ſad condition, and that is the threatning before,
and this is the promiſe now.</p>
               <p>The fourth thing for explication is, what the ſong was that they did then
ſing in the daies of their youth when they came up out of the land of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of <hi>Moſes</hi> his ſong.</note>
               </p>
               <p>That ſong of theirs you shall find, <hi>Exod. 15. Then ſang Moſes and the
children of Iſrael this ſong unto the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> And afterwards you shall
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:42662:190"/>
reade that <hi>Miriam and all the women</hi> ſang likewiſe. In this ſong of theirs,
there are theſe five things Obſervable.</p>
               <p>Firſt, this ſong o <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 15. was the moſt ancyent, the firſt ſong
that ever was in the world that we know of. <hi>Orpheus, Muſaeus</hi> and <hi>Linus,</hi>
the moſt ancyent of the Poets were 500, yeares after this time.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It was a triumphing ſong; <hi>Then ſang Moſes and the children
of Iſrael, the Lord hath triumphed gloriouſly, &amp;c.</hi> When they ſaw Gods
judgements upon the adverſaries, then they ſang in a triumphing way. But
you will ſay, how could they ſing thus when they ſaw ſuch a dreadfull ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle
before their eyes? What, ſing at ſuch a lamentable object, when the
Egyptians were ſo miſerably deſtroyed, when they were ſprawling up and
down in the water, and it is like they heard their ſhriekings, their dolefull
cryes, and ſaw their bodyes how they were caſt upon the ſhore; And then
ſhall <hi>Moſes</hi> and the people of Iſrael ſing? O cruell hearted people that
ſhould ſing at ſuch a lamentable object as this! What, to triumph over
their adverſaries thus fearfully periſhing?<note place="margin">How may we rejoyce at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the wicked</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To that we anſwer. We muſt not be more pittifull then God is,</hi> Pſa. 58.
10. The righteous ſhall rejoyce when he ſeeth the vengeance, he ſhall waſh
his feet in the blood of the wicked.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, this is auſterity, they are cruell hearted people that ſhall
doe ſo. Not ſo neither. <hi>Moſes</hi> was the meekeſt man that ever lived up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the face of the earth, the lovingſt man except Chriſt that ever was; yet
<hi>Moſes</hi> ſang thus when he ſaw the Egyptians deſtroyed; ſo that to rejoyce
in Gods judgements againſt the ungodly, may ſtand with meekneſſe &amp; qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſſe
of ſpirit, with a loving and ſweet diſpoſition as <hi>Moſes</hi> had.</p>
               <p>It is true, we ought not to inſult over wicked men in way of revenge, in
reſpect of our ſelves, but when we conſider the righteous judgments of God
upon his adverſaries, we may be ſwallowed up in the conſideration of Gods
juſtice, and rejoyce in it; But ſo, as not altogether to be without ſome pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and commiſeration of the perſons periſhing: As <hi>Titus Veſpation</hi> is ſaid
to weep, when he ſaw the deſtruction of Jeruſalem, though his enemies.</p>
               <p>But there is a time comming when all the Saints ſhall be ſo ſwallowed up
with God, ſo as they ſhall rejoyce in the deſtruction, yea in the eternall
damnation of the wicked, without the leaſt pitty &amp; commiſeration of them;
they ſhall wholly mind God and his glory without pitying of them, yea
though they were the fruit of their own bodies, and came out of their owne
loyns. But for the preſent, though wee are to rejoyce and triumph in the
works of God and his judgements upon the wicked, yet with ſome mixture
of pitty and compaſſion towards their perſons.</p>
               <p>And mark by the way ſome difference between Gods affection toward
his people, and toward wicked men. It is very obſervable, that when Gods
people come to be in an afflicted condition, if there ſhall be any that dare
to be ſo wicked as to rejoyce in that, God will avenge himſelf on them;
yea if they doe but looke upon his ſervants that are in affliction with any
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:42662:191"/>
kind of contentment, the Lord will be avenged on them for it. But when the
wicked are deſtroyed, God doth not onely give us leave to look at them, but
to rejoyce and ſing praiſes to God for their deſtruction.</p>
               <p>I will give you a Text for this, <hi>Obad, verſe 12. Thou ſhouldeſt not have
looked on the day of thy brother, neither ſhouldeſt thou haeve rejoyced over
the children of Iudah in the day of their destruction.</hi> Mark, God hath a
quarell againſt them that did but look upon the day of their brothers diſtreſs,
and rejoyce. But when deſtruction commeth upon the enemies of God,
then the people of God may look, and rejoyce, and triumph.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is a ſong moſt excellent, in regard of the elegancy of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
and variety of the matter. For verſe 1. <hi>He hath triumphed glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly,</hi>
or thus, <hi>He is become gloriouſly glorious,</hi> or, <hi>in magnifying himſelf,
he hath magnified himſelf.</hi> What an elegant expreſſion is here, <hi>He is mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifyed
above the magnificent,</hi> ſo ſome. All Gods works are glorious, but
ſome are gloriouſly glorious; and ſo is this work of God towards his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rivet</hi> hath a good note upon this: The greateſt glory of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he is moſt glorious, it is in doing good to his own people; ſo (ſaith he)
great men ſhould account it their glory not in ſpoiſing others, eſpecially
thoſe that are their owne, but in doing good, that was the great glory of God
wherein he was gloriouſly glorious, in delivering of his people, not in ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them. In <hi>Eſay,</hi> 14. 20. there is threatned a <hi>diſhonourable buriall</hi> to the
King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> upon this ground, ſaith the Text, <hi>Thou haſt deſtroyed the
land, and ſlaine thy people:</hi> Yea he threatneth his ſeed, <hi>The ſeed of evill
doers ſhall never be renowned,</hi> becauſe he had deſtroyed his land, and ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and ſlaine his people, his owne people.</p>
               <p>Againe, the elegancy of this ſong is in thoſe expreſſions that are in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract;
He is <hi>Fortitudo mea,</hi> and <hi>Laus mea,</hi> and <hi>Salus mea:</hi> Hee is <hi>my
ſtrength,</hi> and <hi>my praiſe,</hi> and <hi>my ſalvation,</hi> all in the abſtract.</p>
               <p>So in that elegant <hi>Epiphonema,</hi> or patheticall eruption of ſpirit, which
though it ſhould have beene in the cloſe as comprehending all the reſt, yet
he breakes forth in the midſt of the ſong, verſe 11. <hi>Who is like unto thee,</hi> O
<hi>Lord? glorious in holineſſe, fearfull in praiſes, doing wonders.</hi> In many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
particulars, we might ſhew abundance of elegancy in this ſong.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it is not onely narrative of what was, but propheticall of what is
to come. A Propheticall ſong, <hi>The Dukes of Edom ſhall be amazed, the
mighty men of Moab trembling, &amp;c. ver.</hi> 15. Fiftly, it is typicall, that is, a
ſong that doth typifie out the rejoycing of Gods people in after time, when
the Saints ſhall overcome Antichriſt, then the ſong of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhall be ſung o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
again: That is a very obſervable place, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 2. 3. of thoſe that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the beaſt, the Text ſaith, <hi>They ſung the ſong of Moſes,</hi> that is, they
ſung that ſong, which this of <hi>Moſes</hi> was but a type of.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, according to ſome, this ſong was a miraculous ſong, ſo <hi>Auguſtine</hi>
hath it in his Tractate, <hi>De mirabilibus Scripturae,</hi> a miracle worthy of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
without meaſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="379" facs="tcp:42662:191"/>
Wherein did he think the Miracle of this ſong to be?</p>
               <p>In this,<note place="margin">Enormi admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num mi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>raculum. <hi>Auguſt.</hi> Anſ., 1.</note> that he imagined that both <hi>Moſes</hi> and all the people, were at one
inſtant inſpired by God to ſing this ſong: this is that which hath beene
thought by ſome. But we are not able to make out that there was ſuch a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
at this time, but rather God inſpired <hi>Moſes</hi> onely, and the other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
followed <hi>Moſes</hi> as he ſung this ſong.</p>
               <p>I note it the rather for this, becauſe here by we may ſee that ſinging is an
Ordinance in the Church of God, not onely in the time of the Law, but in
the time of the Goſpel, for this place, <hi>She ſhall ſing as in the dayes of her
youth,</hi> is ſpoken of the time of the Goſpel, Therefore not onely when one
man hath an extraordinary gift, (as the Scripture ſpeakes, if any one hath a
Pſalme, an extraordinary gift in the Congregation of making a Pſalme)
that he ſhould ſing, but it is an Ordinance to joyne with others who have the
gift of making a Pſalme; ſo were the people to doe here.</p>
               <p>The fifth thing to be enquired after is, the reaſon of their ſinging, what
cauſe they had thus to ſing in the dayes of their youth. The reaſon was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of their great deliverance they had from Egypt, and therein indeed are
many things conſiderable, that will afford unto us many excellent obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Firſt, then they ſang becauſe of their freedome from outward bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.
Bondage hath three things in it.</p>
               <p>1. When any one is under the power of another, under any Law without
his conſent given, either explicite or implicite.</p>
               <p>2. When he ſerveth another without any reſpect to his own good; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ayming at the ſatisfying of the will of him whom he doth ſerve.</p>
               <p>3. VVhen he is forced to doe what he doth with rigour.</p>
               <p>Here you may ſee the difference between a free ſubject,<note place="margin">The differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene a ſlave and a free ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</note> and a ſlave; no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
free ſubject is bound to any laws of men, as mens laws, but ſuch as ſome
way or other he giveth his own conſent unto; thus it is with us in England,
that is the difference betweene us and the Turks, who are ſlaves, they are
bound meerly to the will of thoſe above them; but in England, every free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder,
ſome way or other gives conſent to whatſoever law he is bound un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
therefore there is none can challenge any further power over him by any
Law, but what he hath either explicitely or implicitely given his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
unto. Secondly, he is a ſlave that is forced to obey, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of good to himſelfe, but onely to ſatisfie the will of him whom he doth
obey. There is no ſuch diſtance betweene one man and another, that one
ſhould ſerve another, without reſpect to his own good. Indeed there is ſuch
a diſtance betweene God and us, that the more we are ſwallowed up in aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at God, and the leſſe we ayme at our ſelves, it is the better ſervice; but
there is not ſuch a diſtance between men and men, we are not bound to ſerve
men, but in ſome ayme and reſpect to our own good, ſo far as it concernes
men, Therefore in England when any thing is granted to the King, it is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laly
ſo, as to ſend up ſome other Bill, that may be for the good of the ſubject,
as giving him ſomewhat, but withall expect ſome good and benefit from
him to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="380" facs="tcp:42662:192"/>
Indeed in our ſervice to men, we are to ayme at God, and in the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
God hath put us, to ſeek to glorifie him, more then to provide for our
ſelves; but ſo far as our ſervice hath regard to man only, and looks no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then him, we are not bound to ſerve him, further then with reſpect to
our ſelves and the good of others. Wherefore ſubjects may know that they
are not made meerly for the will of thoſe that are above them, they indeed
ſerve them, but they ſerve them for the good they expect from them.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third is to ſerve out of love, and not to have only rigorous Lawes to
force them to ſuch ſervice.</p>
               <p>Now the people of Iſrael were under bondage in all theſe three reſpects.
Firſt, they were forced to ſerve without any conſent at all. Secondly, they
that did governe them, did not at all ayme at their good; It is no matter for
them, let them periſh as dogs, we will have our worke done, and well done
too. VVhen men ſhall governe ſo as they care not what become of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
of others, ſo they have their wills ſatisfied, this is to make free ſubjects
bondſlaves. And thirdly, all was done out of rigour, they forced from the
people what they did, as for their love they cared not for that. Wherefore
when they were freed from theſe three things, they ſung, and they had cauſe
ſo to doe.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Secondly they ſung when they came out of the land of Egypt, becauſe they
were not only in bondage in Egypt, but in bondage under ſuch a King as they
were. For, conſider who it was they were in bondage unto, and then to be
delivered from ſuch a one, you will ſee a great deale of cauſe of ſinging.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, They were bondſlaves to a King of another Nation. Sometimes
Country and kindred ſake moves compaſſion, but being they are another
people, to whom I have no relation, but only to ſerve my own turn of them,
it is no matter what becomes of them; let become of them what will, I will
have my will ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, They were bondſlaves to a King that ruled by an arbitrary
government, there was but only his will for the Law, he would impoſe what
work and taskes he pleaſed, how many bricks they ſhould make, and when
he pleaſed take away their ſtraw, and yet tye them to the making of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
He governed them not by Law, but by Will.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, They were in bondage under a cruell King, for the King of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt
in the Scripture is called a <hi>Dragon,</hi> for his cruelty, <hi>Ezek. 23. 3. I am
againſt thee Pharaoh, King of Egypt, the great Dragon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, They were in bondage to a King that was an unnaturall King;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> unnaturall in this, that whereas the predeceſſors of the Iſraelites had ſaved
Egypt from periſhing, ſaved the King and his family from deſtruction; yet
now, without any regard to what was done in former times by their prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors,
having this power over them, he oppreſſes them in ſuch an unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
way, ſo as not to care what becomes of them. Fiftly, they were in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
under a King that extreamly hated them, &amp; that is a ſad thing. The text
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> ſaith, <hi>Gen, 43. 32. The Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews, for
that is abomination to to the Egyptians.</hi>

Sixtly, They were in bondage under a wilfull King, under one who was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
ſet upon his will; we ſcarce read of any one that ever was ſo ſet upon
his will as this King was, therefore they expreſſe this in their ſong which they
ſung when they came out of Egypt. <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. 9. bleſſing God that they
were delivered from ſuch a <hi>wilfull</hi> Prince as he was. In the 9. ver. four times
he ſaith [I will] <hi>I will purſue, I will overtake, I will divide the ſpoile, I will
draw my ſword,</hi> and the 5. time, <hi>my luſt ſhall be ſatisfied upon them,</hi> but of
this before, to be ſlaves to ſuch a one, ſo wilfull, was a very hard condition,
the like wilfulneſſe hath beene already noted of the King of Babylon, and
none the like to theſe two; the Text ſpeakes from their deliverance in part
from under the King of Babylon alſo, as if he ſhould ſay, you did ſing when
you came up out of Egypt merrily, and joyfully, becauſe you were delivered
from ſuch a cruell wilfull King, you ſhall ſing ſo again, for you ſhall be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
again from as cruell and wilfull a King as he was; for though not all
the ten Tribes came back, yet it was in part fulfilled by many of them.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, They were in bondage under a ſuſpicious and jealous King, leſt
they ſhould grow to a head, and ſo riſe againſt him, one that thought he
could not confide in them. It is a ſad thing when there are ſuch ſuſpitions
between King and people, or people and King, that they cannot tell how to
confide and truſt one in another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>VVell might they</hi> ſing <hi>therefore in</hi> the dayes of their youth, <hi>when they</hi>
came up out of the land of Egypt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, They ſang when they came up out of the land of Egypt, becauſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
they were freed from what hindered them in the exerciſe of Religion. Hence
<hi>Moſes</hi> told <hi>Pharaoh, that they muſt goe three dayes journey in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to ſacrifice unto the Lord their God;</hi> they could not ſacrifie in Egypt,
therefore when they got freedome to ſacrifice to God, this being a great
mercy they ſang praiſes. Fourthly, They ſang, becauſe their deliverance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
out of Egypt was wrought with a mighty hand. <hi>The Lord hath triumphed
gloriouſly,</hi> hath been <hi>gloriouſly glorious;</hi> ſo the words are. And <hi>ver.</hi> 6. &amp; 7.
marke what the Text ſaith, <hi>Thy right hand, O Lord, is become glorious in
power.</hi> The <hi>hand of God</hi> is God, ſtrength, but the <hi>hand of God in power</hi> is a
greater expreſſion. Thirdly, <hi>Gods right hand in power.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>the right
hand of God is glorious in power,</hi> this is a mighty expreſſion, ſurely great
was the work of God in their deliverance. Yea and further, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. it is ſaid,
<hi>by the greatneſſe of his arme,</hi> not onely Gods <hi>hand,</hi> but his <hi>arme,</hi> and <hi>the
greatres of his arme</hi> was in this work. And <hi>ver. 7. In the greatneſſe of thine
excellency, Mulititudine celſitudinis excellentiae, ſuperbiae elationis,</hi> in the
greatneſs of thine excellency, in the multitude of thy height, of thy elation of
the lifting up of thy ſelf in a kind of pride, (for the word that is tranſlated <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency</hi>
there ſignifies <hi>pride</hi> too.) Now God did this <hi>in the multitude of his
excellency,</hi> that is, he did ſuch a work toward his people, as had a multitude
of glorious works in it, which if you could analyſe, anatomize, you ſhould
find a multitude of glorious excellencies in it. Well might they ſing, when
God did manifeſt himſelf thus.</p>

All theſe will afford us excellent and ſweet obſervations by and by.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Further, they ſang when they came up out of the land of Egypt, becauſe
this mercy was the fulfilling of a promiſe made long before. Therefore the
Scripture telleth us, <hi>That at the end of 430. years, even the ſelfe ſame day,
the hoaſts of the Lord went out of the land of Egypt;</hi> which hath reference to
a promiſe, and ſheweth us that God kept his word to a very day. Hence in
<hi>verſ.</hi> 2. of that 15. of <hi>Exod. He is my God, I will prepare him an habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
my fathers God, and I will exalt him;</hi> As if hee ſhould have ſaid, O
Lord thou didſt make promiſes to our forefathers, now thou haſt fulfilled
thoſe promiſes, thou art our God, and our Fathers God. This made them
ſing ſo merrily.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> 6. It was a mercy that was got by much prayer, for <hi>Exo.</hi> 3. 7. it is ſaid,
<hi>they cryed unto God by reaſon of their afflictions,</hi> there were many cries ſent
up to God before their deliverance, and now being delivered, this made
them ſing.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> 7. It was a mercy that came after a ſore and long bondage.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Laſtly, It was a mercy that they had in order to that great mercy of lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them into Canaan, therefore this they mention as the eſpeciall cauſe of
the joy of their hearts in the 13. <hi>verſ. Thou haſt guided thy people in thy
ſtrength to thy holy habitation,</hi> and <hi>ver. 17. thou ſhalt bring them in, and
plant them in the mountaine of thine inheritance.</hi> The holy Ghoſt ſpeaks
here as if the thing were done already, as if he ſhould ſay thus, O Lord thou
haſt indeed granted unto us a great mercy in delivering us out of Egypt, but
herein we prize thy mercie that it is in order to the bringing us to thy habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and it will bring us at length to the mountain of thy holineſſe; it is not
ſo much that were are delivered from bondage, as that wee expect to bee
brought to thy holy habitation.</p>
               <p>Now ſaith the <hi>Lord,</hi> you ſhall ſing as you did then, look what cauſes you
had then to ſing, you ſhall have the ſame cauſes to ſing again, when I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
to you.</p>
               <p>The laſt thing for the explication is, when this was fulfilled, or to what
time this is to be referred.</p>
               <p>There are four times that this propheſie aims at, and refers unto.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, It began in ſome degree to be fulfilled at their returne out of their
captivity from Babylon, though it is true few of the ten tribes returned, yet
it is clear in Scripture that many of them did then return, and had the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of this mercy, and there was joy and ſinging. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 12. the whole chap.
is a ſong bleſſing God for their return from the captivity, <hi>Jehovah is my
ſtrength, and my ſong, he alſo is become my ſalvation,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. This prophecie aims at ſpiritual Iſrael; ſo in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. it is applied to
the calling of Jew &amp; Gentile together; when the Goſpel was firſt preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Jewes and Gentiles being called home, became the ſpiritual Iſrael of
God, then there was ſinging, <hi>Rom. 15. 20. Again he ſaith, rejoyce ye Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
with his people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="383" facs="tcp:42662:193"/>
The third time that it refers unto, is the delivery of Gods people from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the tiranny of Antichriſt, typified by the tiranay of the <hi>Egyptians:</hi> for
that, the former place is very full, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 2. there you ſhall obſerve, <hi>Thoſe
that had gotten the victory over the beaſt, and over his image, and over his
marke, and over the number of his name, ſtood upon a ſea of glaſs mingled
with fire, having the harps of God in their hands, and they ſang the ſong of
Moſes, &amp; the ſong of the Lamb, ſaying, Great &amp; marvellous are thy works
Lord God almighty, juſt and true are thy ways thou King of Saints,</hi> &amp;c. In
this ſong, which I make no queſtion but this Scripture hath reference unto,
there are divers things obſervable. To take them up briefly by the way.</p>
               <p>1. That they that ſung were thoſe that had <hi>gotten victory</hi> over <hi>the beaſt,</hi>
over <hi>his image,</hi> and over <hi>his mark;</hi> that is a full victory, not only abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Antichriſt himſelf, but any image, any character of him, any thing
whereby they might ſeem to allow of him, to be owned by him.</p>
               <p>2. They <hi>ſtood upon a ſea of glaſſe mingled with fire.</hi> The <hi>ſea of glaſſe,</hi> I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
find interpreted, Chriſtian doctrine, ſo called, for the clearneſs of it, though
not ſo clear as afterward it ſhould be, for there is ſome darknes even in glaſs,
but clear in compariſon of what it was before; for 2 <hi>K. 25. 13. The ſea was
of braſſe,</hi> which is far thicker and darker. But there was <hi>fire</hi> mingled with
this <hi>ſea of glaſs,</hi> that is, though they had a clearer doctrine then before, yet
there were many contentions in the Church through many different opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and much diviſion there was even amongſt the godly. It was a ſadde
condition indeed, yet it is ordinary, eſpecially when Doctrines come to be
firſt cleared, to have great contentions grow in the Church among godly
men. It is no wonder though good men ſhould be of different opinions, yea
and have ſome heat of ſpirit one againſt another, when the light firſt breaks
forth. When men are in the dark they ſit together, and walk not at ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance;
but when light comes, it cannot be expected but there will be diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences.
But yet mark, the godly then, they did not reject the doctrine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there was fire mingled with it, becauſe there was heate of contention,
but the Text ſaith, they were there <hi>with their harps in their hands,</hi> they
were profeſſing this doctrine and rejoycing that ever they lived to that time,
to have the Goſpel ſo clearly revealed unto them.</p>
               <p>And they <hi>ſang the ſong of Moſes,</hi> and not only of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but <hi>the ſong of
the Lamb</hi> too. What was that? Firſt, <hi>great and marvellous are thy works,</hi>
in that we ſee we are delivered from Antichriſtian bondage, as the people of
Iſrael were delivered from Egyptian bondage with a mighty hand of thine;
Oh it is a marvellous worke of God that wee are thus at liberty. Therefore
know this, that whenſoever the Church ſhall be delivered from Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
bondage, it ſhall be a marvellous work of God, therefore we may not be
diſcouraged, becauſe wee meet with ſome difficulties by the way, for wee
ſhal never be delivered, but ſo as it ſhal appear to be a wonder; if we ſhould
be delivered without difficulties, we ſhould not ſee the marvellouſneſs of the
worke.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="384" facs="tcp:42662:194"/>
Further, <hi>Iuſt and true are thy wayes.</hi> God in that deliverance will ſhew
the fulfilling of all his promiſes, and he will fully ſatisfie the hearts of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
who have been a long time ſeeking him, and ſuffering for him. Whereas
the adverſaries, becauſe God did forbear a while in his patience and let them
proſper, thought there was no God in heaven that looked upon them, they
ſcorned at the faſtings, and prayers, and faith of the Saints; But though the
hearts of the Saints were ready to faile, yet at laſt they ſhall ſay, <hi>Iuſt &amp; true
are thy wayes,</hi> Lord we now ſee all thy good word fulfilled, all thy promiſes
made good; now we ſee it is not in vaine to ſeek thee, it is not in vain to wait
upon thee, for <hi>juſt and true are thy wayes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O thou King of Saints.</hi> God will appear then to be a King of Saints. He
is indeed the King of the world now, and the King of his Saints, but he doth
not appear ſo clearly, the kingdome of Jeſus Chriſt as King of Saints hath
been much darkned in the world; We have ſome what indeed of the Prieſtly
and Propheticall office of Chriſt made known to us, but very little of his
kingly office; but when God ſhall fully deliver his people, then they ſhall
magnifie Jeſus Chriſt as the king of Saints in an eſpeciall manner.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, they ſhall ſay, <hi>Who will not feare thee thou King of Nations?</hi> As
if they ſhould ſay, wee ſee now it is good to feare God, wee ſee now God
hath made a difference between him that feareth him, and him that feareth
him not. The <hi>Angel</hi> that <hi>John</hi> ſaw, <hi>Apoc. 14. 6, 7. Flying in heaven, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the everlaſting Goſpel to preach,</hi> cryes with a loud voyce, <hi>Feare God,
and give glory to him;</hi> The feare of God will be mighty upon the hearts of
the Saints in thoſe times. This ſhall be the ſong of <hi>Moſes</hi> that this Scripture
aymeth at, they ſhall thus ſing as they did in the dayes of their youth, when
they came up out of the land of Egypt, yea and the truth is, their ſong ſhall
be much more glorious.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The laſt time this propheſie aymeth at,<note place="margin">Iſa. 51. 11.</note> is the great calling of the Jewes,
then the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Everlaſting joy ſhall be upon their heads, they ſhall
obtain gladneſſe and joy, and all ſorrow and mourning ſhall flee away.</hi> They
ſhall ſo ſing, as never mourn more in this world, in regard of any malice
and rage of their adverſaries. This was not fulfilled at their return out of the
Babyloniſh captivity, therefore there is yet a time for the fulfilling of it, and
the Scripture is clear about the fulfilling it, even in this world; that place
<hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 4. is a repetition of that prophecy, he ſaith there, <hi>God ſhall wipe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
all teares from their eyes, and there ſhall be no more ſorrow nor crying.</hi>
When Jews and Gentiles ſhall joyne together, then they ſhall ſiug indeed
to purpoſe, as they did in the dayes of their youth, when they came up out
of the land of Egypt.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it is a great mercy for people to be delivered from outward bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.<note place="margin">Obſer.</note>
It will be found a great mercy when the world ſhall be delivered from
their outward bondage, when men ſhall ſee they were born free-men, and
not ſlaves, though Subjects, yet not ſlaves, when men ſhall ſee that the
world was not made for twenty or thirty to doe what they liſt, and they
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:42662:194"/>
to account all the reſt as beaſts, yea dogs; as if it were not ſo much for the
lives of thouſands of them to goe, as for their humours and luſts not to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied;
but when men ſhall know, that they are men and not beaſts, and ſo
ſhall live like men,<note place="margin">Obſ.</note> and not like beaſts, to be at the will of others, this will be
a great mercy. But to be delivered from Antichriſtian bondage, is a
greater mercy, then it was for the children of Iſrael to be delivered from
their Egyptian bondage. For,</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage worſe then Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian.</note> when they were in the Egyptian bondage, we reade not that their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
conſciences were forced, that they were forced at all to any falſe worſhip.
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> did not this, but Antichriſt forced to Idolatry.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Though <hi>Pharaoh</hi> layed heavy taskes and burthens upon them,
yet he did not kill them, indeed at length they killed their firſt borne, but
the people of Iſrael themſelves might have their lives ſtill, though with hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
But Antichriſt thirſts for blood; Papiſts are bloody men.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It was the affliction of Gods people to be in bondage in Egypt,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
but it was not their ſin: But to be in bondage under Antichriſt, is not onely
an affliction, but it is ſin, and that of a high nature too.</p>
               <p>4. Though they were under Egyptian bondage, yet they were delivered <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
from Egyptian plagues; but thoſe that are under Antichriſtian bondage,
ſhall come under Antichriſtian plagues. <hi>Come out of her my people, leſt you
be partaker of her plagues.</hi> You muſt not think to eſcape ſo as they eſcaped
out of Egypt; if you ſtay in that bondage, you will be involved in their
plagues. With what an eye therefore ſhould we look upon thoſe who would
bring us into this bondage againe, when God hath begun to give us a little
reviving? <hi>Jer. 37. 20. O my Lord the King</hi> (ſaith <hi>Jeremy) let my ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I pray thee be accepted before thee, that thou cauſe me not to returne to

thee, ſince wee are begun to be delivered from that bondage, doe not
cauſe us to returne to that houſe againe.<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> The ſecond is, A reconciled con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
is a <hi>ſinging</hi> condition. When there is a harmony between heaven and

of glory, but we even rejoyce and boaſt in tribulation:</hi> Having peace with
God, though war withall the world, we rejoyce.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> It is a great mercy, when Magiſtrates and people ſhall generally
joyne together in praiſing God, when they ſhall ſing as they did in the dayes
of their youth, (for that is the promiſe.) How is that? <hi>Moſes</hi> beginneth,
and <hi>Miriam</hi> followeth, the leaders of Iſrael, and then all the people joyne
together, and anſwer one another in their ſinging.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="386" facs="tcp:42662:195"/>
When that day ſhall come that God ſhall ſtirr up the hearts of Magiſtrates
and great ones, that there ſhall be ſinging Hallelujahs to him that ſitteth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the throne, and the Lamb for evermore; and when God ſhall generally
move the hearts of the people, that they ſhall anſwer one another in their
ſinging, and ſo joyne in a ſweet melody; this will be a bleſſed time indeed.
Now perhaps in one place there is ſinging, and bleſſing God for what is
done, in another place there is curſing, and curſing thoſe that do ſing. Some
mens hearts are rejoycing in the great things God doth, other mens hearts
fret and rage when they heare of the great works of the Lord, this makes no
melody in heaven. Perhaps now in the family the Husband ſingeth, and
the wife frets; perhaps the wife ſingeth, and the malignant husband is inra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged;
the ſervant rejoyceth, and the maſter chafeth; the children ſing, and
the parents vex; this is harſh muſique. This is our condition at this day;
there are better times coming, when <hi>Moſes, Aaron,</hi> and <hi>Miriam,</hi> and all
the people ſhall joyn in ſinging praiſe to our God.</p>
               <p>4. Thankfulneſſe to God,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> for mercy cannot be without joyfulneſſe. A
grumbling, penſive, ſadde, dumpiſh diſpoſition, cannot be a true thankfull
heart as it ought. God will not accept in this ſenſe of the bread of mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
It is grievous to the Spirit of God, that we ſhould be penſive and ſad in
the midſt of abundance of mercies.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>They ſhall ſing there.</hi> There, where? at the door of hope in the valley
of <hi>Achor.</hi> You may remember in the opening of that valley of <hi>Achor,</hi> I
gave you what might be underſtood by it according to the moſt, that is, that
God would make the greateſt trouble and affliction of his Church to be <hi>a
door of hope,</hi> to bring mercy to them: And if you take it in that ſenſe, here
riſes an excellent obſervation.</p>
               <p>When God brings into ſtraits,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> yet if he ſhall ſanctifie our ſtraits, making
them means of good to us, we have cauſe to rejoyce. You have an excellent

Becauſe the <hi>Lord</hi> ſhall make the parched ground become a poole, and the

the tongue of the dumb to ſing. Though our tongues be dumb, yet it ſhould
make us ſing when we ſee God working good out of contraries, when wee
ſee things that of themſelves tend to our ruin, and would bring us to miſery,
that are as the valley of <hi>Achor,</hi> yet God working good out of them; if wee
have the hearts of men in us, much more the hearts of Chriſtians, though we
were dumb before, this ſhould make us ſing. Yea all this is brought in as
an argument to ſtrengthen the weak hands, and the feeble knees, and as a

cauſe to ſing even in this valley of <hi>Achor,</hi> for we have not yet been brought
into any ſtraits, but God hath brought good out of them; he hath turned the
parched ground into a pool, and the thirſty land into ſprings of water. It is
our great ſin, that when God calleth us to ſinging, we are yet concluding of
rejecting; we are ready to think if we be brought into the valley of <hi>Achor,</hi>
we are preſently caſt off: Oh no, God calleth you to ſinging, nothwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
you meet with difficulties. <hi>Iſa. 49. 13. Sing O heavens</hi> (ſaith the

God hath comforted his people, and will have mercy upon his afflicted;</hi> But
mark now the next words, <hi>But Zion ſaid, the Lord hath forſaken me, &amp; my
God hath forgotten mee.</hi> At that very time, when the <hi>Lord</hi> was calling for
ſinging, even then they were concluding of rejecting. Take we heed this be
not our condition.</p>
               <p>But take the words as then I told you as I conceived them to be the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the ſpirit of God, that this <hi>valley of Achor</hi> was ſome ſpeciall mercy
that God gave at firſt as <hi>a door of hope</hi> to further mercies he would give af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward,
and there they ſhall ſing.</p>
               <p>Then the obſervation is,</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Lord</hi> is beginning with his Saints in the ways of mercy,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> though
they have not all that they would have, yet it is a ſinging condition. Though
you be but yet brought into the valley of <hi>Achor,</hi> and be but at the doore of
hope, and not entred into the door, though you have not yet got the poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all the mercy God intendeth for you, yet God expects you ſhould ſing.
You muſt not ſtand grumbling,<note place="margin">We muſt reioyce at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of mercie though we have not al we deſire.</note> whining, complaining, and murmuring at
the door, becauſe you have not what you would have; though God makes
you wait at the door, you muſt ſtand ſinging there. It may be ſaid of Gods
mercy as of his word in <hi>Pſal. 119. 130. The entrance into thy word giveth
light,</hi> ſo the entrance of Gods works of mercy giveth light. <hi>Pſal. 138. 5. Yea
they ſhall ſing in the wayes of the Lord, for great is the glory of the Lord.</hi>
In the ways of the <hi>Lord</hi> they ſhall ſing, though God be but in the wayes of
his mercy, and they have not what they would have, yet they ſhall ſing.</p>
               <p>This is certainly one great reaſon why our <hi>doore of hope</hi> is not yet opened
to us as we deſire, or at leaſt that we have not that entrance that we would
have at that door, becauſe we ſtand murmuring; yea we ſtand quarrelling
one with another at the doore, whereas God expects that we ſhould ſtand
ſinging and praiſing his name there. Though wee have not what wee deſire,
yet let us bleſſe God that ever we lived to this day, to ſee ſo much of God as
we have done, though we ſhould never ſee more, though the mercy we look
for ſhould be reſerved for the generation that ſhall follow, yet we have cauſe
to bleſſe God while we live, that we have ſeene and do ſee ſo much of God

not their minds inlightned, their hearts humbled as they deſire, power over
corruptions, abilities to performe duties as they expect, they are preſently
ready to conclude againſt themſelves, ſurely the Lord will not have mercy,
we are rejected. They think they have nothing, becauſe they have not what
they vvould. O unthankfull heart! This is the very thing that keepeth thee

then to be in a ſinging condition,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> but afterward to loſe their joy. At firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
when Gods mercies were freſh to them, in the dayes of their youth, O

               <p>We finde it ſo in people, when they firſt come to enjoy liberty out of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
Church liberties, Oh how they rejoyce in them! how do they bleſſe
God for them! O how ſweet are theſe mercies at their very hearts! they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice
that ever they lived to this time; but within a while the flower of their
youth is gone, and they ſoone have the teats of their virginity bruiſed. At
firſt indeed, O the ſweetneſſe! but ſtay a while and you ſhall finde conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or ſcandoll ariſing amongſt them, or deadneſſe of heart befalling them.
Oh the bleſſed condition that God hath brought us to, to have theſe liberties
and ordinances according to his own way! but within a while we may ſay
as the Apoſtle to the Galatians,<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Where is the bleſſedneſſe you ſpake of?</hi> They
would have <hi>pulled out their eyes for Paul,</hi> What is become of all now? All
their beauty &amp; glory is quite damped, let us take heed that when our hearts
ſeem to be raiſed and mightily affected with mercies, we do not ſoon looſe
our vigour &amp; heat. It hath been ſo with England, when they have had freſh
mercies at firſt, they rejoyced in them exceedingly. I have read of the City
of Berne, when they were firſt delivered from Antichriſt, they wrote the day
of their deliverance upon pillars with letters of gold. Was it not ſo with us
here in England?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="389" facs="tcp:42662:198"/>
I will only inſtance in that deliverance upon the fifth of November,<note place="margin">Lect. 14.</note> how
mightily was both King and Parliament affected with it! their hearts were
exceedingly up, then there was bleſſing God, for their deliverance from Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,
then there were prayers and thanksgivings ſet forth, and in them, this
expresſion againſt Popery, <hi>Whoſe faith is faction, whoſe Religion is rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
whoſe practice is murthering of ſoules and bodyes;</hi> When the mercy
was freſh, how did their ſpirits worke? then they profeſt againſt all kinde
of Popery. Reade but the Proclamation about the ſolemnity of that time,
and the expresſions of the prayers then ſet forth, and one would have thought
verily then that Popery ſhould never have prevailed in England again; who
would ever have thought it posſible that a Popiſh Army ſhould ever have
had any countenance in England more? Certainly, if a Popiſh Army had
been raiſed at that time when mens hearts were ſo up, all the people of the
land (if it had been but with clubs) would have riſen and beaten them to
pieces.</p>
               <p>It is ſo with many young people, when God firſt beginneth to worke
upon their hearts, O how are they for God! then their ſpirts are mightily up
for Chriſt, <hi>Pſal, 90. 14. O ſatisfie us early with thy mercies, and then we
ſhall be glad and rejoyce all the dayes of our lives;</hi> It is a ſweet thing when
the latter part of that prayer followeth, when God ſatisfieth young people
with his mercy, and that ſatisfaction abideth, ſo as they rejoyce <hi>all the dayes
of their lives</hi> afterward. The Lord doth many times ſatisfie young ones
with his mercy, but they quickly grow dead and cold, and their hearts are
ſoone hardned and polluted,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> and they doe not rejoyce all the dayes of their
lives. Another Obſervation, that reſtored and recovered mercies, are very
ſweet and precious mercies. <hi>They ſhall ſing as in the dayes of their youth;</hi>
They were once in a bleſſed ſweet ſinging condition, they had loſt it, but
now God promiſeth to recover them. <hi>Iob 29. 2. O that I were as in months
paſt, as in the dayes when God preſerved me, when his candle ſhined upon my
head, and when by his light I warlked thorough darkneſſe; as I was in the
dayes of my youth, when the ſecret of God was upon my Tabernacle. Iob</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth
this earneſtly, that he might have reſtored, recovered mercies; What
a happy condition ſhould I be in then, ſaith he, if it were now with me as in
the dayes of my youth! May not many in this place ſay ſo? God hath been
gracious to them in former dayes, he hath given many ſweet manifeſtations
of his love, many ſoule-raviſhing communications of himſelf unto them!
but how have they loſt them! They may well ſay, O that it were with us as
in the dayes of our youth! Oh that God would reſtore to us what mercy we
once had! what a bleſſed condition ſhould we be in then! But God here
giveth a gracious promiſe, that he will reſtore them, that he will give them
that which is the petition of <hi>David, Pſa. 51. Reſtore to me the joy of thy ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;</hi>
Lord I have loſt it, O that I might have it againe! How happy
ſhould I be! So <hi>Pſ. 132. 1. By the Rivers of Babylon there we ſat down, yea
we wept there when we remembred Zion, we hanged our harps upon the
willowes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="390" facs="tcp:42662:199"/>
They were in this ſad condition, but if one ſhould have come to them and
have ſaid, what will you ſay if you ſhall be reſtored againe and goe to Zion,
to Jeruſalem againe, and have ſongs there, as much and as delightfull as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore?
their hearts could not have held in them. This mercy would be like
that <hi>wine</hi> mentioned, <hi>Cant.</hi> 7. 9. that is ſo ſweet, that it cauſeth the lips of
thoſe that are <hi>asleepe to ſpeake;</hi> If there be any life left, ſuch a mercy will
raiſe and actuate it. <hi>Pſal. 126. 1. 2. When the Lord turned againe the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity
of Zion, our mouthes were filled with laughter, and our tongues with
ſinging,</hi> when God granted them a recovered mercy. As a poore prodigal,
that hath left his fathers houſe, and afterward is come to beggery and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and is under bondage, &amp; is almoſt ſtarved; he ſitteth down under a hedg,
wringing his hands, falleth a lamenting the loſſe of his Fathers houſe, and
conſidering what comfort he had in his Fathers preſence, cryeth out of his
folly and madneſſe; but if one ſhould come and ſay to him, what will you
ſay if your Father ſhould be reconciled to you, and ſend for you home, and
promiſe to put you in as comfortable a condition as ever? O how would
this cauſe ſinging in his heart! Thus God promiſeth to his people, that he
would reſtore them to that ſinging condition they had loſt.</p>
               <p>They ſhall ſing as in the dayes of their youth.</p>
               <p>That which made this mercy ſo ſweet, was becauſe it was a promiſed
mercy. Hence this Note.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Promiſed mercies are ſweet mercies.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

<hi>there is the cauſe of ſinging,</hi> Bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſrael, that
hath performed the mercy promiſed.</p>
               <p>Giving out of a promiſe is ſweet to a gracious heart, it can ſing then; much

<hi>Stand ſtill and ſee the ſalvation of the Lord,</hi> there is the promiſe. Mark now

                     </gap>phat</hi> had not got the promiſe fulfilled, it was only made; they
had not got the victory over their enemies, but onely a promiſe that God
would be with them, &amp; preſently <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> &amp; all the people fell a ſinging.</p>
               <p>A gracious heart ſeeth cauſe enough to ſing, if he have got but a promiſe,
but much more when he hath got the performance.</p>
               <p>If the promiſe of a mercy hath ſuch ſweetneſſe in it, what ſweetneſſe then
hath the mercy of the promiſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="391" facs="tcp:42662:199"/>
But the promiſe was not only barely fulfilled, but fulfilled with a high
hand, and that made them ſing. This may be another Obſervation:</p>
               <p>When God appeareth remarkably, with a high hand in delivering his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
then the mercy is to be accounted a precious mercy indeed, and all the
people of the Lord ſhould ſing and praiſe him. <hi>Eſay</hi> 43. 19. 20. mark there,
when God had told of an extraordinary hand of his in a way of mercy, ſaith
he, <hi>I will plant them in the wilderneſſe,</hi> and ſo goeth on: <hi>Then</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhal
this be, that they may ſee, and know, &amp; underſtand, &amp; conſider, that the
hand of the Lord hath done this, and the Holy One of Iſrael hath created
it.</hi> When Gods imediate hand doth a thing, when it helps a people in an
extraordinary way, he expects that they ſhould <hi>ſee,</hi> and <hi>know,</hi> and <hi>conſider,</hi>
and <hi>underſtand</hi> together: All theſe expresſions are heaped one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And if any people be called to this, we are at this day; God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
extraordinarily to us. Oh that we had eyes to ſee! Oh that we had
hearts to conſider and underſtand, that we might give God the glory that is
due to him!</p>

may be triumphed in. When you want a mercy, pray much for it; the more
you pray for it, the more you will ſing when you have it, and the leſſe pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

we looke upon this preſent mercy of our deliverance, for which we doe now

be a great many difficulties between this and our comming to enjoy thy ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation,
but thou wilt guide us in thy ſtrength, thy ſtrength ſhall carry thy
people along till it bring them to thy habitation; this was that which made
them ſing ſo chearfully as they did. And again, <hi>v. 17. Thou ſhalt bring them
in, and plant them in the mountaine of thine inheritance, in the place,</hi> O
<hi>Lord, which thou haſt made for thee to dwell in, in the ſanctuary,</hi> O <hi>Lord,

               <p>A third Obſervation is,</p>
               <p>New mercies ſhould renew the memory of old. <hi>They ſhall ſing as in the

renews the memory of former guilt, ſo new mercies the memory of former.
Hath God delivered you from any danger now? were you never delivered
before? if but when you were a childe, thoſe deliverances you now have
ſhould bring into your memory what then were.</p>

So in a nation, doth God grant to a nation any new mercy? this new
mercy ſhould bring into the memory of that nation all the former mercies
that ever that nation hath received. <hi>Pſal. 68. 26. Bleſſe ye God in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregatations,
even the Lord from the fountaine of Iſrael.</hi> Not only you who
are true Iſraelites, but in your bleſſing God now, let preſent mercies be to
you but as ſtreames to bring you to the fountaine. Conſider of all the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
along till you come to the fountaine, even that Covenant that God hath
made with Iſrael.</p>
               <p>A fourth is,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> All former mercies to Gods people ſhould help Faith in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving
future mercies. That is raiſed from hence. Why doth the Prophet
tell them or comming out of the land of Egypt? He ſpeaks of ſome mercy
that was to come to Iſrael;<note place="margin">Former mercies muſt ſtrengthen our faith in future.</note> now hee names this coming out of the land of
Egypt, that he might helpe and ſtrengthen their Faith in the beleeving of
what mercy was to come: As if he ſhould ſay, That God that hath wrought
ſo wonderfully for you, in delivering you out of the land of Egypt, is able,
and willing to make good his word in granting to you deliverance for time
to come. We have excellent Scriptures for this, as <hi>Pſal. 66. 6. He turned
the ſea into dry land, they went thorough the flood on foot, there did we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
in him.</hi> Marke, <hi>they went thorough the flood,</hi> and <hi>there did we rejoyce
in him:</hi> How did we rejoyce in him? it was many hundred yeares after
that we came to rejoyce: But upon the manifeſtation of Gods great good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to his people in former dayes, our faith commeth to be ſtrengthened in
Gods mercies for our times, and there did we rejoyce in him, we did rejoice
in the worke of God when they went thorough the Red-ſea upon dry land,
for it is an argument of Gods mercy to us of the power, goodneſſe, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
of God to us. Another temarkable Text is, <hi>Hoſ. 12. 4. Hee had
power over the Angel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Obſ.</note> 
                  <hi>he found him in Bethel, and there he ſpake with us:</hi>
Marke, <hi>he had power over the Angel, he found him in Bethel;</hi> VVho
was that? It was <hi>Jacob,</hi> who many years before, but <hi>there he ſpake with
us,</hi> hee did not ſpeake with <hi>Jacob</hi> onely, but there hee ſpake with
<hi>us,</hi> that is, whatſoever goodneſſe the Lord did ſhew to <hi>Jacob</hi> in Bethel, it
concerned us for the ſtrengthening of our faith, <hi>Mat. 22. 31. 32. Have ye
not read that which was ſpoken unto you, ſaying, I am the God of Abraham,
and the God of Iſaac, and the God of Iacob?</hi> This was ſpoken to <hi>Moſes</hi>
many hundred yeares before; but that expreſſion of Gods grace then, was
a ſtrengthening the faith of the godly, when Chriſt ſpake, and is the ſame to
us now.<note place="margin">Obſer.</note>
               </p>
               <p>A fifth is, where there is a proportion of mercies, there ought to be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of thankfulneſſe. <hi>They ſhall ſing as they did in the day when they
came out of Egypt.</hi> I will grant unto you as great mercies as they had, and
I expect as great thankfulneſſe from you as I had from them; as they ſung
to my praiſe, ſo muſt you ſing too. God ſheweth as much mercy to you
now, as he hath done heretofore, I appeale now to you, nay God appeales
to your conſciences, Is there a proportion of thankfulneſſe as of mercies?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="394" facs="tcp:42662:201"/>
There hath been a time when you have ſung to the praiſe of God, when
your hearts have been inlarged to give God praiſe, why ſhould it not be ſo
now? A ſixt obſervation is, deliverance out of Egypt is an aſcending conditi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on,
That ariſeth from the words as they are in the Originall, <hi>They ſhal aſcend
out of the land of Egypt,</hi> ſo I told you the words were in the Hebrew; as then
God would never reſt till he brought them up to Mount Zion, ſo when God
beginneth to deliver his people from Antichriſtian bondage, they ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
reſt in their ſpirits, untill they be got to the height of Reformation, to the
height of their deliverance, that is, to come to enjoy Gods Ordinances in
his own wayes, in the purity and the power of them. This is our miſery and
our b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

reſt, whereas we ſhould riſe yet higher and higher, and expect that God

               <p>Seventhly, From the connection of theſe words with what followes, <hi>They
ſhall ſing as in the day when they came up out of the land of Egypt, and they
ſhall call me Iſhi, and ſhall call me no more Baali, for I will take even the
very names of Baalim out of their mouths, and they ſhall remember them no

from all the remainders of their Idolatrous worſhip, they ſhall not ſo
much as remember their very names, the Reformation ſhall be ſo perfect;</p>
               <p>From thence the Obſervation is,</p>
               <p>When God raiſeth the ſpirits of people to rejoyce in his mercy, then is the
time for them if ever, to ſet up a through Reformation; then when their
hearts are warmed, inflamed, and inlarged with the goodneſſe of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, then is the time to caſt out all the remainders of all ſuperſtition, of all
kinde of falſe worſhip. I will give you two excellent Scriptures for this, the
one is, <hi>Eſay 30. 19. Thou ſhalt weep no more</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>he will be very gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
unto thee at the voyce of thy cry;</hi> The Lord promiſeth abundance of
mercy, he tells them that they ſhall weep no more, he will be very gracious;
now marke what followeth in the 22. verſe, <hi>Ye ſhall defile the covering of
thy graven Images of ſilver, the ornaments of thy molten Images of gold,
thou ſhalt caſt them away as a menſtruous cloth, thou ſhalt ſay unto it, Get
thee hence;</hi> The other Scripture is, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. 26. there you finde that
there was great joy in Jeruſalem, ſuch <hi>joy</hi> as the text ſaith, <hi>was not ſince the

not beene the like; Marke then in the beginning of the next Chapter, ſaith

Jeruſalem ſince the time of <hi>Solomon;</hi> Now <hi>all Iſrael went out to the Cities

<hi>Iudah:</hi> What had <hi>Iſrael</hi> to doe with <hi>Iudah? Iudah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided;
But now their hearts were ſo inflamed for God, that they were not
able to abide any falſe worſhip amongſt their brethren, though it belonged
to Judah, yet they would goe help their brethren to caſt down all their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and to cut down their Groves and Altars, this was when their hearts
were warmed with joy in bleſſing the name of God. VVhen God once
warmeth the hearts of people, it is much what they will doe for God then:
They will not ſtand examining every nicety, but they will fall upon the work
directly; the joy of the Lord was the ſtrength of their hearts at this time:
as it is with the luſts of wicked men, when they get into company, at feaſts,
in Taverns, and there they are drinking, while their luſts are warmed, then
what deſperate reſolutions have they to doe wickedneſſe! So when Gods
Saints are exerciſed in Gods Ordinances, and are refreſhed with the ſweet
love of God, when that lies glowing at their hearts, what ſtrong reſolutions
have they for God! then they can doe any thing for God.</p>
               <p>Now the very name of <hi>Baalim</hi> muſt be taken away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>VERSE</hi> 16. And it ſhall be in that day, ſaith the Lord, that thou

ſhall be no more remembred by their name.</p>
               <p>Here we have as full a Propheſie and promiſe of as thorough reformation
of the Church, as any I know we have in Scripture, God hath a time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme

               </p>
               <p>They ſhall call me Iſhi, and no more Baali.]</p>
               <p>Why? what great difference is there betweene theſe two names <hi>Iſhi</hi> and
<hi>Baali,</hi> that God will have one but not the other?</p>
               <p>The truth is, both of them ſignifie even almoſt the ſame thing; Both of
them are names very fit for a wife to call her husband by, <hi>Iſhi</hi> is <hi>my hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,</hi>
and <hi>Baali</hi> is <hi>my husband</hi> too. But the word <hi>Iſhi</hi> cometh from a word
that ſignifieth <hi>ſtrength,</hi> the woman being the weaker veſſel, therefore ſhee
calls her husband <hi>Iſhi, my ſtrength;</hi> for the husband ſhould be ſtrength to
the wife, he ſhould live with her as a man of knowledge, he ſhould be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
to her, he ſhould help her in all her weakneſſes, &amp; afflictions. <hi>Baali</hi>
ſignifieth <hi>my Lord,</hi> as well as <hi>my husband;</hi> it is a word that moteth rule and
authority, <hi>Iſhi</hi> is a word that hath more love and familiarity in it; <hi>Baali</hi> is a
word that noteth the inferiority of the wife to the husband. Now God ſaith
he will be called <hi>Iſhi,</hi> but not <hi>Baali;</hi> why? there is no hurt in the word <hi>Baali</hi>
it ſelfe; the word <hi>Baali</hi> is a very good word, and hath a good ſignification,
&amp; it is proper to God, as any word that can be given to him by the Church
(but that God did forbid it here) for it is no more when the church cals God
<hi>Baali,</hi> then if the Church ſhould ſay, O God that art my Lord, my husband,
who art to rule &amp; govern me;</p>

                  <pb n="396" facs="tcp:42662:202"/>
Yea and we find that God gives to himſelf this name, <hi>Iſa. 54. 5. Thy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
is thy</hi> [<hi>husband,</hi>] ſo it is in your books, but the word in the Hebrew is
the ſame that we have here, <hi>Thy Maker is thy</hi> [<hi>Baali,</hi>] ſo that <hi>husband</hi>
and <hi>Baal</hi> is the very ſame. But now becauſe they had abuſed this word <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,</hi>
and given into their Idols, therefore God would have no more of it;
though it was a good word, a ſignificant word, and as proper to God as any
was. As the word <hi>Tyrannus</hi> was a name once for a King, Kings were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Tyrants,</hi> without any ſuch ill ſignification as now it carries with it; but
becauſe they had gotten the ſole power into their hands, they did ſo oppreſs,
abuſe their power, therefore oppreſſors were called <hi>Tyrants.</hi> So the Latine
word <hi>fur,</hi> which is for a <hi>thiefe,</hi> it was once the ordinary word for a <hi>ſervant,
Fures,</hi> and <hi>Servi</hi> were wont to be the ſame, and without any ill ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but becauſe afterward many ſervants grew to be falſe, to ſteale from
their Maſters, therefore <hi>fures</hi> was altogether taken in the worſt part, onely
for theeves. So <hi>Sophiſta,</hi> a Sophiſter, was one that ſtudied wiſdome, but
becauſe they did ſo much degenerate, many under the colour of the ſtudy of
wiſdome, deceived others, therefore the name <hi>Sophiſter</hi> was uſed in the worſt
part. I might inſtance in many other.</p>
               <p>For further opening this. May not the name <hi>Baal</hi> be mentioned? God
tells them that <hi>he would take away the name of Baalim out of their mouths.</hi>
VVhy may not we uſe this word <hi>Baali</hi> in our mouths?</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, Yes, it is not unlawfull for us to mention the word,
notwithſtanding this, for the holy Ghoſt a long time after this mentions the
word in an hiſtoricall way: <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 4. hee ſpeaks there of thoſe <hi>that had
not bowed their knees to Baal,</hi> the word you ſee is mentioned &amp; remembred
by the ſpirit of God, therefore it was not a ſin; nay not only the word <hi>Baal,</hi>
b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r it is not unlawfull to mention the names of any Idols of the heathen, for
the holy Ghoſt doth ſo likewiſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 18. 11. ſpeaking of the ſhip that they
ſayled in, he ſaith there, <hi>whoſe ſigne was Caſtor and Pollux,</hi> the names of
two heathen Idols. And you may obſerve that here in the text the rememb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
is as much forbidden as the mentioning. Now if it were a finne meerly
to mention the names of the heathen gods, it were a ſin to remember them.
Therefore God means the mentioning of them <hi>Honoris gratia,</hi> any way for
their honour, or without deteſtation of them.</p>
               <p>The words being thus opened, you have many excellent obſervations out

you went ſo nigh to Popery as you did, eſpecially at ſuch a time when the

               <p>Fifthly, The Church of God muſt not worſhip God after the manner
that Idolaters doe: They muſt not ſo much as make mention of the names
that they did, certainly then not worſhip God in the way they doe, in thoſe
orders and ceremonies they doe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Marke that place;</hi> Deut. 12. 30. Take heed to thy ſelfe that thou be

may be a lawfulthing, yet becauſe it is the way idolaters have taken up, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it muſt be rejected, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44. 20. there is a comandement to the Prieſts
of the <hi>Lord,</hi> that they ſhall not <hi>ſhave their heads,</hi> nor ſuffer <hi>their lockes to

are in the Hebrew; the old Tranſlation, <hi>They ſhall round their heads,</hi> is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Hebrew; the reaſon is this, becauſe the idolatrous Prieſts, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the ſeveral ways of worſhipping their Idols, ſome did ſhave their
heads, others wore long hair as women, ſome kind of Idols being worſhipped
one way, ſome another, all in exceſſive ways: Now ſaith God to his Prieſts,
they ſhall doe neither; ſo that it is the injunction of God to his Miniſters
there to be <hi>Round-heads.</hi> Certainly the Devil forgate that place of Scripture
when he raiſed up ſuch a name to reproach men by, which we have the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe

Temple ſtood weſt-ward, and upon this ground, becauſe there were ſo many
among whom the Jews lived, that were worſhippers of the Sun, and in their
worſhip they would ever look Eaſtward, &amp; upon that very reaſon the Lord
would not have the Holy of holieſt built Eaſtward; Now all your Chancels
in England are built Eaſtward, and it was wont to be the order and way of
your ſuperſtitious worſhippers evermore when they came into ſuch a place
to look Eaſtward, and bow ſolemnly themſelves, not only to the Altar, but
Eaſtward. I have ſeen my ſelf a Biſhop, who when the Communion table
was ſet down in another place, he neglected that, and goes to the Eaſt end of
the Chancell, and boweth himſelf, though his back was upon the table. And
you ſhall obſerve it in all your burials, the corps are laid Eaſt and Weſt, for
this end by ſome, that when Chriſt comes to Judgment, they may be ready
to look him in the face, it being a trodition that he ſhall come from the eaſt.
You muſt not think, that thoſe who do not follow the old cuſtomes of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition,
do it out of croſneſs of diſpoſition; it is the ſame way that God
brought his people up in, when they ſaw Idolaters worſhip one way, they
ſhould worſhip another way; we muſt take heed of borrowing from the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians,
if you borrow from them you may think it riches, but you may get
their botches and boils: we have enough in the word of God, we need no i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation
of Idolaters and Papiſts in the way of worſhip.</p>
               <p>Yet further,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> that which lies more fully in the Text is, ſuch things that in
themſelves conſidered have no hurt in them, yet when they come to be abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to Idolatry, they muſt be caſt away; <hi>I will take the name of Baali out of

ſuch things as in the beginning were of Gods own inſtitution, if they do
not yet continue his inſtitutions, if God doe not require the continuance of
them ſtill, they muſt be taken away, not only corrected, but removed, and
wholly rejected from Gods worſhip. I will give you an inſtance for both
theſe together, <hi>Exod. 34. 13. Ye ſhall deſtroy their altars, break their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,

forbidden upon the ground of <hi>ſcandoll,</hi> that is enough: <hi>Calvin</hi> in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
to the Lord Protector in King <hi>Edwards</hi> dayes, hath theſe words; What
other things were thoſe ceremonies maintayned by in England but ſo many
pleaſing allurements that enſnare poore miſerable ſoules, &amp; bring them into
evil? certainly theſe that we have retayned have brought abundance of evil
this way, they have been the enſnaring of many ſouls. In theſe three things
the rules that concerne the Jews have a morality concerning us.</p>
               <p>But yet theſe rules muſt be obſerved with ſome cautions, or elſe we may
goe away and not underſtand the ruels aright.</p>
               <p>They muſt be underſtood firſt in things that are not Ordinances continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by God; for certainly if it be an Ordinance that God hath appointed,
though Idolaters abuſe it never ſo much, we muſt goe on in it. It is true, the
brazen ſerpent was an Ordinance of God, but it was an Ordinance but for a
time, it was not a continued Ordinance, and therefore being abuſed to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry
it was to be deſtroyed; but when a thing is an Ordinance appointed
by God to be continued in the Church, we muſt go on in the uſe of it, though
it be abuſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="406" facs="tcp:42662:207"/>
As in Baptiſme, the ordinance is water, though they abuſe water, we muſt
continue the uſe of it; in the ordinance in the <hi>Lords ſupper</hi> is the uſe of bread
and wine, though they abuſe thoſe elements, we muſt continue them, why?
becauſe no abuſe is an argument to refuſe that which is a duty; the ſubject
of ſcandall is a thing indifferent, but if it be an ordinance, we muſt continue
our obedience, whether men be offended or not offended.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Neither can any of theſe rules hold in any thing that is of neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
uſe for the worſhip of God, ſo as we cannot enjoy the worſhip of God
without them. As for places, ſupoſe Idolaters have abuſed a place of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for Gods worship, when we have no other place to meet in, this is (for
the preſent at leaſt) of neceſſary uſe to Gods worſhip, there is a naturall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of a place, and if no other for the preſent may be had, we are bound
to worship in that place, the abuſe of men muſt not hinder Gods worship,
God hath never put his worship under the power of wicked men, ſo as they
should keep his people off from it when they pleaſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, If it be any ceremony that of its own nature (not by vertue of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
inſtitution from man) hath that decency in it as that the want of it would
be an undecency, then though it be never ſo much abuſed, we are to goe on
in it; for it is the duty of Gods people to worſhip God in a decent way; It is
the rule of the Apoſtle, <hi>Let all things be done decently,</hi> but there is a miſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ake
in that uſe that many make of that Scripture, this rule is, that which the
light of nature teaches, though we had never found it in Scripture, it is not
meant of ſuch a decency as the inſtitution of man puts upon a thing, but ſuch
a decency as God in the nature of the thing puts upon it, ſo that if it were
wanting, the worke would bee undecently performed: But if the things be
meerly mans inventions and inſtitutions, having their ſuppoſed decency, not
from what is indeed in the things themſelves, but from that which mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
puts upon them, then they come not under that rule of the Apoſtle,
but the abuſe of them is argument enough for their rejection.</p>
               <p>But it may be objected,<note place="margin">Object.</note> If we can inſtruct people what the abuſe is, and
what right uſe they may make of ſuch things, will not that ſerve for the retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
them?</p>
               <p>No certainly,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> it had not been enough for the Jews to uſe the name <hi>Baali,</hi>
though their Prophets had taught them what the abuſe of it was.</p>
               <p>This is as if a man ſhould keep a company of rags, that have lien a great
while upon plague ſores, and ſay it is enough, I will waſh them cleane, and
lay them out to ayre them; will any wiſe man keep ſuch rags in his houſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this precence? Thoſe things that have had poyſon in them, none will be
ſo unwiſe to keep them by them, upon pretence of waſhing them clean; if
they be broken veſſels of which there is no uſe, they are caſt upon the dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill
with leſſe trouble and more ſafety.</p>
               <p>All things that are of mans invention, yea thoſe things that have beene
Gods Ordinances, but now are out of date, &amp; are not for the preſent Gods
Ordinances the Scripture calls them <hi>beggerly rudiments;</hi> you cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:42662:207"/>
mens inventions to cloaths, or any thing worth the ayring or keeping,
but the truth is, all ſuch things that have been abuſed to Idolatry, are no other
but as ſuch dirty rags, and plaiſters laid upon plague-ſores.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But further you will ſay,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Object.</note> If that uſe we receive them for be not the ſame
uſe they were in, if we retain them for another uſe that is good, why may we
not doe it?</p>
               <p>The text anſwers that,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> though the Jews ſhould call God <hi>Baali</hi> in a right
ſenſe, it was not enough, they muſt wholly reject the very mentioning of the
name. But further, ſuppoſe a harlot ſhould be brought out of a moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
ſtews in <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Paris,</hi> and brought to <hi>Dover</hi> into an honeſt mans
chamber, is ſhee not a harlot ſtill? and is there not a provocation in her to
uncleanneſſe, though ſhe become now to lye not in the ſtewes, but in the
chamber of an honeſt man? So in all thoſe things that have been abuſed to
Idolatry, though you ſhould think you make uſe of them in a better way, it
is no other then to bring a harlot out of the ſtews, into a place not ſo vile, and
to company with the harlot there.</p>
               <p>Beſides, if a mans wife whom her husband had not without juſt cauſe ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
for uncleanneſſe with another man, ſhould get ſomething from that
man, and keep it in her boſome, or lay it next her heart, and ſhould tell her
husband, true, ſhe keeps ſuch a thing, but ſhe intends no hurt in it, it is a good
thing, onely ſhe had it from him, will this think you ſatisfie any jealous huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band?
The Church is the wife of Chriſt, he is jealous, and he hath cauſe to
be jealous, for he knows while we are in the fleſh, we are prone to ſpirituall
filthineſſe; and if we take any ceremony from Popiſh Idolatry, and joyne
with his own Ordinances, and think to put off Chriſt thus, we intend to make
no ill uſe of it, this will not ſatisfie Chriſt.</p>
               <p>If any ſay,<note place="margin">Object. Anſw.</note> why ſhould we not retain our liberty if the things be good?</p>
               <p>But why ſhouldſt not thou manifeſt thy hatred to all Idolatry? And why
ſhouldſt not thou tender thy brethren ſo, as to prevent all ſcandall that may
come by the uſe of ſuch things?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But you will ſay,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Object.</note> the idolatry of Papiſts, and the idolatry of Heathen is
not the ſame, there is a great deale of difference between the Heathens in
worſhipping their Idols, and the Papiſts worſhipping of God, though in a
falſe way?</p>
               <p>Indeed the difference ſeems to be much,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> but yet the Idolatry is even the
ſame in both; for you are miſtaken, if you think that many of the <hi>Heathens</hi>
worſhipped a falſe God, otherwiſe then the Papiſts doe; though they made
ſtocks and ſtones their Idols, yet they worſhiped the God that was <hi>Primum

96. brings in one anſwering thus, We do not worſhip a ſtone, but the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
the ſtrength, and the powers of the great God wee worſhip: And ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
one <hi>Maximus Madaurenſis</hi> that <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks of in his 43. <hi>Epiſtle,</hi>
Who is ſo madde, or ſo void of ſenſe that will doubt whether there be more
Gods then one? we invocate the vertues of this one God under many names,
diffuſed through the frame of the whole world.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="408" facs="tcp:42662:208"/>
VVhat more faire anſwer can Papiſts give for their Idolatry then they
did? Therefore the thing continueth ſtill cleare, that (with thoſe rules and
cautions that have been named) ſuch things as have been abuſed to Idolatry,
muſt wholly be caſt away; we muſt not retaine them, and think to put off
God with ſuch diſtinctions. To what end doe we retaine them? Is there
not ſufficient in the worſhip of God it ſelfe to make it acceptable to him?</p>

in honour of their Idol gods did weare upon their heads a coronet of bayes,

                  <hi>Tertullian</hi> therefore writes a whole Tractate to

and he cryes out in an exclamation, in commendation of this Souldier; Oh
moſt glorious ſouldier, who would thus venture himſelfe, and not comply

that would rather comply then indure the hazard, and ſay, where is it

it? ſaith he, we muſt looke into the Scripture to ſee what we may doe, and
not thinke it enough that the Scripture doth not directly forbid this or that
very particular. By this we ſee that ſome to avoid trouble and perſecution,
will as much as ever they can comply with the wayes of Idolatry, yet thoſe
that are of a true Chriſtian heroick ſpirit indeed, will not comply with them,
but will rather hazard the ſoreſt perſecution.</p>
               <p>Thus it ſhould be with us, we muſt not retaine any thing that hath been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed
to Idolatry, ſo as to keep the honourable memoriall of it; wee muſt
not comply with Idolaters that way; and eſpecially in regard of that great
Idol of the Croſſe (which we inſtanced in, the laſt day) not ſo far to retaine
it as to bring it into the Ordinances of God, the very Sacrament, this puts a
great honour upon it; yea and too too great an honour is put upon it in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
it in the eminenteſt place of the City, and to thinke it is an ornament
unto it, whereas it is indeed a great diſgrace and diſhonor, and retaines the

upon Gods reconciliation to his people. From whence the next note is, when
God is reconciled to his people, there will be a thorow Reformation both
outward and inward. Idolatry is caſt out not onely from the heart but from
the mouth, the taking away the names from their mouthes is a ſynechdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che,
and notheth the uttertaking away of all wayes of Idolatry in the
outward practice as well as in the inward affection. The more reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
there is with God, the more enmity againſt Idols and ſuperſtitious
worſhip. A fruitfull ſigne then it is that we in England were never thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reconciled unto God, becauſe we never yet have caſt off our Idols.</p>

As ſome remaynders of ſuperſtition abiding amongſt us, did not long ſince
break forth to moſt horrid and vile ways of falſe worſhip, ſo ſome remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of Gods wrath that hath been amongſt us, this day breakes forth into
a moſt dreadfull flame. When the people of the Iews ſhall be called again,
and God ſhall be perfectly reconciled to his Churches, then Idolatry ſhall
be perfectly rejected, and there ſhall never be ſo much as mention of their
Idols any more, this Text aymes at thoſe times, and ſhall perfectly be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
at that day, that is the day when God will do it.</p>
               <p>They ſhall call me no more Baali, but Iſhi, <hi>my husband.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thence the note is,</p>
               <p>When a people is reconciled to God,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> then they call God theirs, my huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
<hi>Iſbi. Pſal. 16. 3, 4. David</hi> profeſſeth that he would not ſo much as
<hi>take up their names into his lips,</hi> of which before. Now mark what follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
preſently upon that, <hi>ver. 5. The Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is my portion,</hi> when
the Prophet is ſo taken off from Idols, as not to mention the names of Idols,
then <hi>The Lord is my portion;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sin makes us loſe the boldneſſe of our claim in our inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in God.</note> So here now <hi>Iſhi, the Lord is my husband,</hi>
now can we claim a peculiar intereſt in God indeed. This is the evil of ſin,
it hindereth a nation, a ſoule from clayming this intereſt in God. God is a
bleſſed and glorious God, yea but what is that to this people, to this apoſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
people? what is that to this apoſtatizing ſoule? but when the ſoule
comes into God, &amp; comes off throughly to the work of Reformation, then
this God is my God, <hi>Iſhi, my husband.</hi> Can any comfort, any profit that
you have in ways of ſinne countervaile this great loſs? you gaine ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
in the fleſh, ſome profit in your eſtate, but you loſe the comforts
of your intereſt in God, what is your gaine now? thinke of this when any
temptation comes, I may be yeelding to this temptation, get this content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the fleſh, but I ſhall loſe this bleſſed priviledg of clayming an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Iſhi,</hi> The word compared with the former <hi>Baali,</hi> is a word of
more love then the former. <hi>Baali</hi> is a word, though it ſignifies <hi>my husband</hi>
too as well as <hi>Iſhi,</hi> but it is husband under the notion of dominion, under
the notion of power that cauſeth feare; but <hi>Ishi</hi> is a husband under the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of love and protection. Hence the note is,</p>
               <p>God delights to have his people look upon him with love and delight.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Obſer.</hi> God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights to have his people look upon him with love.</note> It
is Gods care, and it is his good pleaſure that his people ſhould not looke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him ſo much as one that hath dominion over them, but that they ſhould
look upon him with joy and love, and call him <hi>Ishi.</hi> The more reconcy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
we are unto God, the more have we the uſe of the loving appellations of
God. For a ſoule to be alwayes under the ſpirit of bondage, to looke unto
God only as the Lord of all, this is not ſo pleaſing to God; but when you
come to have the ſpirit of <hi>adoption,</hi> the ſpirit of grace, an Evangelicall ſpirit,
that you can look upon him with love, and ſay <hi>Ishi, my husband,</hi> that title
of love and goodneſſe, this pleaſes God at the heart. It is reported of <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus</hi>
that he would not have the title of <hi>Lord</hi> given to him, he refuſed it, and
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:42662:209"/>
would rather have his people to looke upon him under the notion of love as
a <hi>father,</hi> rather then to feare him. It were happy that all Princes were of
this minde, to deſire that their people ſhould rather love them then feare
them! It is a moſt villainous, wicked, and curſed principle that is in ſome,
who infuſe into the ſpirit of Princes, let your people feare you, no great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
whether they love you or no. <hi>Suetonius</hi> relateth this paſſage of <hi>Auguſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
when a poor man came to preſent a petition to him with his hands ſhak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and trembling out of feare, the Emperor was much diſpleaſed, and ſaid,
It is not fit that any ſhould come with a petition to a King, as if a man were
giving meat to an Elephant that is afraid to be deſtroyed by him. God doth
not love the bread of mourners to be offered up in ſacrifice, hee loveth to
have people come unto him with a holy boldneſſe, with a filiall, not with a
ſervile and ſlaviſh ſpirit. Chriſt laid down his life to redeeme us that wee
might ſerve the Lord without feare.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> 
                  <hi>They ſhall call me Iſhi,</hi> that is, <hi>My ſtrength.</hi> The Church ſhould
looke upon Chriſt as the ſtrength of it; <hi>Thy maker is thy husband,</hi> and who
is he? <hi>The Lord of Hoſts is his name, thy redeemer, the God of the whole
earth ſhall he be called.</hi> When the people of God can look upon Chriſt their
husband as the Lord of hoſts, and their Redeemer as the God of the whole
earth, then they finde quiet and ſatisfaction in their ſpirits, <hi>Pſa. 89. 17. God</hi>

                  <hi>I will take the names of Baalim out of their mouth, and they ſhal

vanities though they may ſeem for the preſent never ſo glorious, yet in time
they will vaniſh and come to nothing, God hath a time to make them ſo to
vaniſh, as they ſhall not ſo much as be thought off. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 22. it is ſaid of the

to be appointed for, there is no good cometh of them for the preſent, but in
the very uſe they come to nothing; but time ſhall be that God will cauſe
them all to periſh utterly, and the very remembrance of them ſhall be taken
away. It is true for the preſent while mens hearts are ſet upon ſuperſtitious
wayes, O how glorious are they in their eyes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but theſe glorious things will
come to nothing, whereas thoſe Ordinances of God that ſeeme to be but
meane things, wherein the ſimplicity of the Goſpel appeareth, they ſhall
appeare full of beauty, though for the preſent they ſeeme to be darkened,
they ſhall be glorious in the eyes of the Saints to the end of the world.</p>
               <p>Not long ſince what a ſtirre was there about the more then decent, even
ſuperſtitious adorning of Temples, and building of Altars, and brave Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopies,
what ſumptuous things and fine knacks had they, and all to ſet out
a pompous ſuperſtitious way of worſhip? this altogether prevailed; as for
the purity and ſimplicity of Gods wayes and worſhip, how was it tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled
under feet as an unworthy contemptible thing? but theſe things that
for a while ſeemed ſo glorious, begin to vaniſh, and wee hope ere long will
come to nothing, the very memory of them ſhall periſh, the purity of Gods
worſhip, and the ſimplicity of the Goſpell in Gods Ordinances ſhall recov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

their hearts clinging to them, being very unwilling to be taken off, now &amp;
then their conſciences are wrung, yet they hold faſt, and then conſcience hath

yet perhaps true grace lyes at the bottome after all this.</p>
               <p>But God having a love unto them, by ſome way or other takes off their

doe it by ſome notable works o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

long as mens engagements hold, that they cannot enjoy their eſtates, liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

not be taken off from them; they pleaſe themſelves in this (and perhaps they
ſpeake what they thinke) that they doe nothing againſt the light of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences;
for why? their ingagements keepe off the ſtrength of truth, that it
comes not to a full conviction of conſcience: But when God ſhall by any
worke of his providence take off their hearts from ingagements, and then
come and ſet before them the ſame truths that formerly he did, they come to
ſee now a convincing evidence in thoſe truths, they ſtand admiring that they
ſaw it not before, wonder what the matter was, they read ſuch bookes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that had the ſame arguments againſt their wayes, and for the truth, but
they could not ſee the ſtrength of them before, now they ſee it apparently,
and they are aſhamed of themſelves every time they goe into the preſence of
God, they are confounded in their owne thoughts to thinke, that though
truths were ſo clear before, they did not ſee them, now they ſee them with ſuch
cleareneſs, as they thinke they could lay downe their lives for them, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they ſuffer for time to come, they can never yield to what they have
yeilded to heretofore: What is the matter? God hath come in with power,
God hath taken off their hearts. God attributeth this to himſelf, <hi>I will take
the names of Baalim out of their mouthes;</hi> whatſoever they have to ſay for
the keeping of ſuch names and reliques of Idolatry, yet I will come with
power upon their hearts and take them out of their mouths.</p>
               <p>Then indeed when God thus commeth the thing will be done. And let
us take heed we doe not ſtand out too long, leſt God come to take off our
hearts by ſome dreadfull way of judgement or other; It were better our
mouths were ſtopped, our objections ſilenced, and ſo all the reliques and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders
of falſe worship were taken from us thorough the word and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God: If that will not doe, God will come in ſome other way, and
take the name of <hi>Baalim</hi> out of our mouths; And if wee will keepe the
memory of ſuperſtitious wayes, God may extirpate the memory of them
by ſuch wayes as may prove fearfull unto us, and make our hearts to ake,
and our eares to tingle. VVee have a notable paſſage for this, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 6.

that God ſhould lay waſte your Cities, to lay waſte your Altars, Croſſes,

becauſe he could not (that we may ſpeake according to the manner of men)
aboliſh their Altars, but by laying waſte their Cities, ſaith God, rather then
your Altars ſhall ſtand, your Cities ſhall downe. God hath wayes, and
moſt terrible wayes too to take away the memory of ſuperſtitious vanities;
Oh that vve had hearts to joyne with God before he cometh in ſuch a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

your bounds, as if you were in league with the ſtones that are your
land-marks, as if they had agreed with you, and were in covenant that they
would undertake to ſtand, and to ſet out the bounds of your fields for ever:
And the beaſts of the field alſo ſhall bee uſefull to you, and do you no
hurt.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay,<note place="margin">Object,</note> ſometimes the beaſts of the field doe hurt the Saints,
how doth God make a covenant with them?</p>

                  <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. of that place of <hi>Job</hi>
he ſpeaks of a time when <hi>God corrects</hi> and men <hi>deſpiſe not the chaſtning of
the Almighty,</hi> now this in <hi>verſ.</hi> 23. hath reference unto that time: that is,
when any do make uſe of Gods correction, doe not deſpiſe it but in a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
way ſubmit unto Gods hand of correction, then <hi>God will make this
league with the ſtones of the field, and with the beaſts of the earth.</hi> If God
hath corrected you with any ſickneſſe, and you doe not profit by that ſicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
it is juſt with God that a beaſt of the field, that ſome or other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſhould meet you, and be more terrible unto you then ever your ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
was. And the promiſe here in <hi>Hoſea</hi> is to thoſe that are reconciled to
God, who have caſt off their ſuperſtitious vanities: And becauſe wee are
not here perfectly reconciled, therefore this promiſe is not perfectly fulfill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;

the call of the Jews, and then I believe that this promiſe ſhall be literally ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled,
and thoſe other promiſes in <hi>Eſay</hi> and other places, where God ſayes
he will make <hi>the Lion to eate ſtraw with the Oxe,</hi> and the like, and that <hi>no
venomous creature shall doe them hurt;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when the beaſts do no hurt.</note> When the calling of the Jews ſhall
be, the creatures ſhall be brought into ſuch a kind of excellency in a manner
as they were in <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe, they ſhall come to the primitive inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:42662:212"/>
the Lion was not at the firſt creation wont to live upon prey: the creatures
were not made to prey one upon another, therefore the promiſe is that the
Lion ſhall live in that kind of quietneſſe as it was to do in Paradiſe, if man
had not ſinned; And at the calling of the Jewes it is very like there ſhall be
ſuch <hi>a reſtitution of all things</hi> (as it is called <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 21.) the creatures ſhall
be reſtored to ſuch a knd of excellency as it had at the firſt in the Creation:
And though in part this may be fulfilled to Gods people, ſo as the beaſts of
the field ſhall do them no hurt, that is, if they prevail againſt them it ſhall be
for ſome gracious ends that God aymsat, yet for the literall fulfilling of it
it is reſerved for that day. Thirdly, VVhen God is reconciled to his
people,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> ſhall the beaſts of the field and the fowles of the ayre, and the cree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
things of the earth be at peace with the Saints? what a wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
thing is it then in men, that the more any are reconciled unto God, the
greater enemies are they unto them? God promiſeth when his people be
reconciled to him, the creature ſhal be reconciled unto them; yet thou a vile
wretch when thou ſeeſt one grow up in the wayes of reconciliation with
God,<note place="margin">A wicked thing, the more God is reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to men the more to hate them.</note> thy enmity increaſes towards him; what a horrible wickedneſs is this?
it is more then bruitiſh by farre, it is deſperate wickedneſſe; as it was with
thoſe Kings of Canaan, <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 10. 5. aſſoone as the Gibeonites had made
peace with <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> and were in coveuant, the five Kings conſpired againſt
them, they lived quietly enough before with them, but when they heard that
they had made a covenant with <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> they preſently conſpired againſt
them; Thus it is with many at this day, when you had your companions
who would drink, ſwear, and break the Sabbath, and be unclean, and ſcorn
with you, they were good fellowes then, how would you hug and embrace
them, and delight in them? but ſo ſoone as God hath wrought upon their
hearts, and they are brought from enemies to be reconciled unto God, now
your hearts are oppoſite to them, now you look upon them as your enemies,
now you hate them, now your ſpirits riſe againſt them: O horrible &amp; deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
wickedneſs! the Lord rebuke you this day, the Lord ſtrike upon ſuch
a heart. Before <hi>Saul</hi> was converted hewas a man of repute, but aſſoone as
he turned Chriſtian, he was a <hi>peſtilent,</hi> a <hi>ſeditious</hi> fellow, <hi>Away with ſuch
a man from the earth, he is not worthy to live,</hi> the next newes wee heare,
<hi>forty of them conſpired together, and bound themſelves with an oath, that
they would neither eate nor drinke till they had killed him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>I will make a Covenant,</hi> ſaith God, you ſhall have this mercy,
and have it by covenant.</p>
               <p>Mercy that commeth by Covenant is excellent mercy indeed.<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> The ſame
mercy that cometh in by a worke of generall providence is nothing ſo ſweet,
nothing ſo firme as that mercy that cometh in by Covenant. When the
Saints enjoy a mercy, though it be outward, they are not ſo taken with the
mercy, for the outward part of it, becauſe they have ſome comfort and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
to the outward man by it, but they are taken with it upon this
ground, they ſee even this outward mercy cometh to them by vertue of
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:42662:213"/>
Gods Covenant with them, that ſweetneſſe and makes firme the mercy;
when they goe up and down the field and the beaſts come not upon them to
deſtroy them,<note place="margin">Mercy that comes in by covenant is ſweet.</note> they can looke upon their preſent ſafety as enjoying it in the
Covenant. You will ſay, the wicked can walke up and down in the fields,
and the beaſts not deſtroy them.</p>
               <p>Though they doe, yet a godly man hath more ſweetneſſe in this then he,
in that he can ſee this his ſafety from the Covenant: when he rides a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
his beaſt is not made an inſtrument of Gods wrath to daſh out his
braines, perhaps it is ſo with his wicked neighbour that rides with him, but
that from whence the preſervation is, is different, it is a mercy to the godly
man form the Covenant that God hath made with him, <hi>to preſerve him in
all his wayes,</hi> it is but generall providence to the other; wicked men may
have the ſame mercies for the matter of them that the godly have, yet there
is a kernell in the mercy which onely the Saints enjoy.</p>
               <p>There are two things obſervable in a mercy comming by Covenant.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. It is more ſweet. 2. More firme. More ſweet, <hi>Pſal. 25. 10. All the
paths of the Lord are mercy and truth, to ſuch as keepe his covenant.</hi> This
is a ſweet promiſe, a ſoule-ſatisfying promiſe, more worth then all the riches
of your City, even that one promiſe; all the paſſages of Gods ordinary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
are <hi>mercy and truth to thoſe that keepe his Covenant.</hi> Marke, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
they are mercies to you, there is a generall bounty you have in your or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
preſervation, but they are not <hi>Mercy and truth</hi> to you, there is the
addition, they are <hi>Mercy and truth</hi> to the godly, that is, they are ſuch mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
as are bound to them by Covenant; Therein <hi>David</hi> rejoyceth, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſaith he in the beginning of the Pſalme, <hi>I will lift up my heart unto
God,</hi> as amongſt other reaſons ſo for this, that <hi>all the paths of God</hi> are not
onely <hi>mercy,</hi> but <hi>mercy and truth:</hi> You have beene preſerved, and have
had many mercies from God, Well, they are Gods mercies unto you, but
are they mercies and truth to you? that is, Doe they come to you in a way
of promiſe? Looke to that, there is the ſweetneſſe of a mercy, and it is a
good ſigne of a gracious heart to looke more to the Originall whence mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
commeth, then to the outward part of the mercy.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They are more firme, <hi>Eſay 54. 10. The mountaines ſhal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
&amp; the hills be removed, but my kindneſſe ſhall not depart from thee:</hi>
Why? <hi>For the Covenant of my peace ſhall not be removed.</hi> That mercy
that you have, I give it in a way of Covenant, and the hills and mountaines
ſhall depart rather then that kindneſſe of mine ſhall depart.</p>

<hi>Abraham,</hi> you ſhal find there that in ten verſes of that Chap. God
repeateth <hi>his Covenant</hi> which he made with <hi>Abraham, thirteen times,</hi> to

                  <pb n="419" facs="tcp:42662:213"/>

deſire yet ſay as <hi>David did,</hi> yet the Lord hath made a Covenant with us or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered

               <p>6.<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> Is this a mercy for God to make a Covenant with the beaſts for his
people? what a mercy is it then for God to make a Covenant with his Son
for his people? It is that we are to bleſſe god for, that he will make a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
with brute beaſts for our good, but that God will make a Covenant
with his owne son for our good, for our eternall good. That God ſhould

onely the Son of God, the ſecond perſon in Trinity, and there was a moſt
bleſſed tranſaction between God the Father, and God the Son, for our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting
good before the world began, and upon that dependeth all our

we are ready to think, we are poore weake creatures, we cannot keepe Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant

Covenant with the Father, and hath perfectly performed all conditions the
Father required of him, the worke hath been perfected by the Son, and here
is our comfort. Raiſe your drooping hearts by this meditation.</p>
               <p>The ſecond part of this peace, and that is a promiſe of deliverance from
hoftility, from the enemy, <hi>I will breake the bow, and the ſword, and the
battell out of the earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> Peace is a great blesſing, it is a great mercy to have the bow and
the ſword broke. It is a part of the Covenant that God makes with his

<hi>the breaking of ſwords into plough-ſhares and ſpears in pruning hooks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You finde the contrary when God threatneth judgement to a people,
<hi>Joel.</hi> 3. 10. he threatneth thus, to <hi>beate their plongh-ſhares into ſwords,
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:42662:214"/>

that the plow-ſhares should be beaten into ſwords; that the ſpeares should

               <p>This peace is a moſt amiable thing, and lovely in all our eyes, every man
deſireth it, and God promiſeth it unto his people in many places as a moſt
ſpeciall fruite of his love unto them. <hi>Eſay 33. 10. Jeruſalem ſhall be a qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
habitation, a tabernacle that ſhal not be taken down;</hi> And <hi>Num.</hi> 6. 25,
26. <hi>The Lord make his face ſhine upon thee and be gracious unto thee, the
Lord lift up his countenance upon thee and give thee peace;</hi> the ſhining of
Gods face appeareth in giving of peace to a Nation: therefore <hi>Jer,</hi> 16. 5.
where God threatneth the taking away of peace, marke the expreſſion, <hi>I
have taken away my peace from this people ſaith the the Lord, even loving
kindneſſe and mercies.</hi> He doth not ſay I have taken away <hi>peace,</hi> but I have
taken away <hi>My peace,</hi> and then, when <hi>My peace</hi> is taken away, I will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
take away <hi>loving kindneſſe and mercies,</hi> how eaſie were it to let out
ones ſelfe in large diſcourſes in the high commendations of peace? God tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
us in theſe days to ſet a high price upon it. We have had a peace a long
time and the Lord knowes we have not priced that mercy; now we know
what a ſad thing it is to have war in our Gates.<note place="margin">The evil of civill war.</note> And if this be a fruite of
Gods Covenant to have peace, we have cauſe to bewayle the breach of our
Covenant. Surely there is a great diſpleaſure of God out againſt us; this
cup of blood that is prepared and powred forth and drunke in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
is a moſt dreadfull one, our brethren have drunke deepe of it, we have
been afraid of it long ſince, we have heard of rumours of wars, and when
the Cup was abroad we prayed that if it were poſſible it might paſſe from
us, this Cup did paſſe and went to our brethren in Ireland, and now it is
come unto us, the ſword hath had its circuite, and now it is come amongſt
us, and that which is come is exceeding dreadfull, becauſe our wars are not
with forreign enemies, but Civill wars the worſt of all. I have read in the
Romane Chronicles, that in a battell between <hi>Sylla</hi> and <hi>Marius,</hi> there was
a ſouldier by accident killed one, not knowing who it was, but after he was
ſlaine he ſaw it was his brother, preſently in anguiſh of ſpirit he ran his ſword
into his owne bowels. This we finde to be ordinary among us, even brother
to be againſt brother, yea ſon againſt father of each ſide at this time. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
therefore it is time for us to fall upon our knees, and to be humbled
before the Lord for the breach of our peace.</p>
               <p>Peace is a ſweet mercy, therefore pitty it is that it ſhould not be improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
pitty is it that it ſhould be abuſed. Oh how have we abuſed our form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
peace! God gave us peace before, to what end? That we might be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difyed
and ſo built up in the feare of God and comfort of the holy Ghoſt, as
<hi>Acts</hi> 9. 31. it is ſaid, <hi>the Churches had reſt, &amp; were edifyed, and did walk
in the feare of God, and the comforts of the holy Ghoſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have not made this uſe of the reſt God hath been pleaſed to afford us,
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:42662:214"/>
but we have growne wanton with our peace, with this precious jewell, and
juſt it is with God to take it from us.</p>
               <p>And now we doe deſire peace, but to what end? Still ayming at this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
at this that we might have more freedome to ſatisfie our luſts, and
to make proviſion for the fleſh, that is the very ground of moſt mens deſire
of peace: whereas if we did underſtand the true worth of peace indeed, we
would thinke it a very low end to deſire peace onely to attaine this.<note place="margin">Peace right<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly prized.</note> 
                  <hi>Ezek.</hi>
37. 26. Marke the promiſe that is there, <hi>I will make a Covenant of peace
with them, it ſhall be an everlaſting Covenant with them, and I will place
them and multiply them, and will ſet my ſanctuary in the middeſt of them
for evermore.</hi> Yea that is a comfortable peace, to be deſired indeed, when
God by peace ſhall make way to ſet his ſanctuary amongſt us. If we did
deſire peace upon theſe termes, we might have peace ſooner then we are like
to have it.</p>
               <p>Againe, Peace is ſweet, therefore pitty it is that it ſhould be falſifyed. <hi>Pſ.</hi>
28. 3. there are ſome that <hi>ſpeake peace</hi> to their neighbours, but <hi>miſchiefe
is in their hearts.</hi> It is pitty that ſuch a precious thing as peace ſhould be
ſerviceable to mens luſts, that it ſhould be pretended only to drive on a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
deſigne, Peace is too good to be ſerviceable to mens baſe ends.</p>
               <p>Yet further, Peace is a great bleſſing, therefore pitty it is that it ſhould not
be endeavoured for to the uttermoſt.<note place="margin">War that brings peace is better then peace that brings war.</note> Yea curſed be that warre that hath
not peace for the end of it, it is that which ought to be as the Embleme of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

is true, war produceth very dreadfull effects, but war that ſhall bring forth
peace, is better then peace that produceth war; and the more we do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
peace, the more doe wee ſtill commend that war that tends to the
bringing forth true peace, rather then to ſeeke for a falſe peace that will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
moſt dreadfull war afterwards.</p>
               <p>Peace is a great bleſſing from God, but we muſt take heed we buy it not too

<pb n="423" facs="tcp:42662:215"/>
people came againſt, though Gods hand was very remarkable in going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with them, working many miracles for them, yet the Text obſerveth
that there was none that would make peace with them only <hi>Gibeon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">God is the Prince of peace, he is the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer of it as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth.</note> why? <hi>for
was of the Lord to harden their hearts to come againſt Iſrael in bat tell that
they might utterly be deſtroyed.</hi> God intended to deſtroy them, therefore
God hardened them that they ſhould not make peace with his people. God
is the Prince of peace, therefore he diſpoſeth of it as he will; Many devices
may be in the hearts of men, they have many plots and contrivances, but the
counſell of the Lord ſhall ſtand. <hi>Pſalm, 29. 11. The Lord ſitteth upon the
floods, yea the Lord ſitteth King for ever. The Lord will give ſtrength to his
people, the Lord will bleſſe his people with peace.</hi> That is not the peace for
God to bleſſe his people with, for which they muſt lay open their throats to
be cut, and betray his cauſe. God need give no ſtrength for this, but Gods
way is to <hi>give ſtrength to his people,</hi> and then <hi>to bleſſe them with peace.</hi> We
love peace, but let us look to have our peace thorow the ſtrength of God:
put thoſe together, the Lord hath promiſed it, &amp; do you pleade this promiſe;
though we ſeem weak, yet <hi>the Lord will give his people ſtrength, and ſo he
will bleſſe his people with peace.</hi> We muſt work our peace by improving
Gods ſtrength, not thinke to get peace by a ſluggiſh complyance, &amp; a baſe
unworthy yeelding to our adverſaries, <hi>Jer. 14, 19. We looked for peace,</hi> it
ſeemes they were in ſome treaties, <hi>and there is no good, for healing, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
trouble,</hi> all their treaties came to nothing: But mark what follows, <hi>ver.</hi>
20. <hi>We acknowledge, O Lord, our wickednes &amp; the iniquity of our fathers;</hi>
O Lord we dwell amongſt people that are ſet on fire, we ſpeake of peace,
yea when they ſpeake of peace they have miſchiefe in their hearts, O Lord
our wickedneſſe and the iniquity of our fathers is great, O Lord pardon our
iniquity. This is the way to have peace, to make up our peace with God.</p>

when they ſhall throughly reforme and ſet up my worſhip in that way that

is the way to a thorow peace. Let our wiſdomes be pure, and then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
it will be peaceable. We have a moſt excellent Scripture for this, <hi>Iſa</hi>
33. 20. Jeruſalem is there promiſed to be <hi>a quiet habitation,</hi> what follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth?
<hi>ver. 22. For the Lord is our judge, the Lord is our law-giver,</hi> the more
we entertain him as judge, &amp; our lawgiver, the more peace we ſhall have,
<hi>Iſa. 9. 7. Of his government &amp; peace there ſhal be no end.</hi> When the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Chriſt commeth, then cometh peace. <hi>Zach. 6. 13. He ſhal rule u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon

VVhat is the reaſon that the counſell of peace hath not prevayled to this
day? We have cauſe to feare they have not beene ſet betweene both, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the Kingly Office and Prieſtly Office of Chriſt to advance them
both. <hi>Eſay 32. 17. 18. The works of righteouſneſſe ſhal be peace, and the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of righteouſneſſe quietneſſe, and aſſurance for ever, and my people ſhall
dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in ſure dwellings, and in quiet reſting
places.</hi> See how the Holy Ghoſt addes one word to another, to ſhew that
true peace is in the wayes of righteouſneſſe. When mens counſells for peace
are crooked counſells, when they ſeek to company for their own ends, when
the honour of God is not their chiefe ayme, it is juſt with God to daſh all
their counſels. <hi>Eſay 59. 8. The way of peace they know not,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>there
is no judgement in their goings, they have made them crooked paths, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
goeth therein ſhall not know peace.</hi> Wee know the going of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
is a crooked going, it windeth up and downe; ſo many of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellours
of peace have gone like the ſerpent, winding up and down in their
carnall policies, they have not ſtudied reformation, but have gone in crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
paths, and therefore they have not brought forth the true effects of peace.
But one place more, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31, 22. 23, there the Lord ſpeaks concerning his
people, when he was about to deliver them from captivity, <hi>How long wilt
thou goe about?</hi> that is, you doe not goe on the right way, you compaſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
you have fetches becauſe you meet with difficulties in your way, you
thinke by this and the other meanes to avoid troubles, but you ſhall goe on
by a right line: what followeth? <hi>The Lord bleſſe thee O habitation of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
and mountaine of holyneſſe;</hi> Apply your counſels that way to be the
habitation of juſtice and the mountaine of holineſſe, and the worke is done,
execute juſtice upon Delinquents that are in your power, and ſet up the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
of God in the right way of worſhip, this is the way of peace, but all
this while you have gone about, Oh that the Lord would deliver our great
Councellours from going about. <hi>They ſhall lye down ſafely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence the note is, onely Gods great peace bringeth ſafety, if we patch up a
falſe peace upon baſe &amp; unworthy terms, we muſt not thinke to lye downe
ſafely; but when God promiſeth peace a fruit of the Covenant, then it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
<hi>they ſhall lye downe ſafely,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Only Gods peace brings ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> And I ſuppoſe none of you would have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

poſſible do you think to lye downe ſafely, except the Lord deſtroy the evill

out of the land, that ſo we may lye downe ſafely? Can you thinke to dwell
ſafely ſo long as ſo many evil beaſts are in the land, &amp; ſo exaſperated in the
higheſt of all their rage? Certainly, if a falſe &amp; a patched up peace ſhould be
made, we were in a moſticle &amp; hazardous condition, eſpecially thoſe who
have appeared for the Cauſe of God; thoſe who have ſhewed themſelves
moſt faithfull, can they lye down ſafely in the confidence of ſuch a peace?</p>

If you have the hearts of true Engliſh-men, you would never deſire any

Then preſently, ver. 9. <hi>The God of peace ſhall be with you.</hi> We would be

the peace of God. You all deſire Peace, and ſo the adverſary pretendeth;
take heed you be not deluded with vaine words; that which is your end in
your thoughts, is their means to drive on their deſignes; and what good will
ſuch a peace doe you? you will be no more ſecure then you are, nay your

We may be delivered from our enemies, but the Lord may afrighten

I will make them lye down in truſt and confidence, that is, to go to

what a mercy this is, we have many nights lain down ſafely, and ſlept quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and have riſen up comfortably, you have little thought of the giving God

prize ſuch a mercy now, when they goe to bed they are afraid of every little

               <p>What would ſome of our brethren give for one nights reſt in ſafety, that
when they goe to bed they might ſay, Well, I hope this night I ſhall have
quiet reſt, I ſhall not be troubled in my ſleep. In many places they are faine
to ſleep in the day, and to watch in the night. It is true, here in the City you

God, a great priviledge for the Lord to quiet our ſpirits in theſe dangerous
times, in theſe trembling dayes, when every mans hands are upon his loyns.
Many who are free from their adverſaries, yet through the timerouſneſs of
their ſpirits they cannot have one nights quiet, they turmoyle themſelves

It may be the enemies will come, and we ſhall loſe our lives, and all will
be rent-from us, and this makes them that they cannot lye downe ſafely,
though danger be not yet neere them, but when God is pleaſed to quiet the
heart in the moſt troubleſome times of all, that you can lye down ſecurely,
this is a choyce mercy, it is a fruite of the Covenant.</p>
               <p>This mercy the Lord promiſeth, <hi>Pro. 3. 23. Then ſhalt thou walke in

<hi>Pſ. 107. 3. So doth the Lord give his beloved reſt;</hi> others they labour and

no ſuch excellency in my wayesto cleave to them, but you have departed

mercy to you, convince you ſo of the vanity of all other things your hearts
runne after, and of that fulneſſe of good there is in me to ſatisfie your ſoules

The Scripture makes much mention of Eſpouſals and of marriage, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
the great myſterie of the grace of God to his people. The holy Ghoſt
ſeems to delight much in this Allegory: there is none more frequent in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
then it, which is a very great honour to a married condition: And ſuch
ought to be the lives of thoſe that are in a married condition, as much as may
be to reſemble the bleſſedneſſe of the condition of a people reconciled unto
God, for in all ſimilitudes there muſt be ſomething in the thing to reſemble
that which it is brought for. Married people ſhould ſo live, as all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the ſweetneſſe, the happineſſe of their lives, may be put in mind thereby
of that ſweetnes &amp; happineſs there is in the Churches comunion with Jeſus
Chriſt. I appeale to you, are your lives thus? Now in a married condition
there are theſe foure things moſt remarkable. Firſt, There is the neereſt uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no
that can be, <hi>They two ſhal be made onefleſh;</hi> this is the power of God in
an Ordinance, conſider it, two that not perhaps a month before were ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
one to another, never ſaw the faces one of another, did not know that
there were ſuch in the world, if they come under this ordinance, though it be
but a civill ordinance,<note place="margin">The ſtrong union in marriage.</note> theſe two ſhal now be neerer one to another then the
child that came out of the fathers loynes, or out of the bowels of the mother,
the fruite of the wombe ſhall not be ſo neere now to thee, nor muſt it love
thee ſo much as this party, that not long ſince it was a meere ſtranger unto.</p>
               <p>Whence cometh this but meerly from the power of an Ordinance? One
would thinke that the affection of a mother to the fruite of her own bowels
ſhould be more then it were poſſible for her to have to a ſtranger ſhe had
never ſeen before in her life; but it is not ſo, when a woman cometh under
this Ordinance, ſhe now commeth to have (according to that which is her
duty) more affection to one that was ere while a ſtranger, then to the child
that came forth of her owne bowels, ſo a man then to one that came out of
his owne loynes. Here is the power of Gods Ordinance, though but civill.</p>
               <p>Now then if an Ordinance of God, though but civill, hath ſuch an effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in it, what efficacy have divine Ordinances then? Certainly they have
mighty efficacy upon the ſoule when they are adminiſtred in the way of
God. So it is here, <hi>I will betroth thee;</hi> as if God ſhould ſay, thou waſt not
long ſince as a ſtranger unto me, one caſt off, yea thou waſt as an enemy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me, but now all the creatures in heaven and in earth, the very Angels
themſelves ſhall not be more deare unto me, in a nearer communion then
you. This is true of a wretched ſinfull creature that hath not onely been as
a ſtranger unto God, but an enemy unto him, he cometh now upon conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
and union with Chriſt, to be in a nearer conjunction and further com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with God then the very Angels in heaven are in ſome regard, for
they are never ſaid to be the Spouſe of the Son of God ſo as the Saints are.</p>
               <p>This is the mighty power and love of God in uniting his Saints to his Son.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Conjugall communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ful. leſt</note> There is in nothing in the world that full communication of one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
creature to another, as there is in that condition of marriage; ſo in our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
marriage with Chriſt, there is an inconceiveable communion of one
to another <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ally,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="433" facs="tcp:42662:220"/>
God hath two wayes of communication of himſelfe, one is infinite, that is to
his Son in that inconceivable myſterie of the generation of the Son; he hath
other wayes of communication of himſelf after a finite manner; but of al
the finite ways this is the greateſt, his comunication of himſelf to his Saints
in Chriſt; God hath no ſuch comunication of himſelf to all the creatures,
as he hath to his Saints in his Son. God in compariſon communicateth lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
or nothing of himſelf to the frame of heaven &amp; earth, ſo as he doth to any
one of his Saints. So far as there wants communion in a married eſtate, ſo
far there wants the bleſſing of it, it ſhould be full: The communion of God
to his Church is a full communion, his wiſdome, power, riches are made o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to the Saints, the merits, the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt are made all over to
them.</p>
               <p>This is mutuall, there is no ſuch communication of any creature to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as there is of the hearts of the Saints to God; one converted to God, lets
out his heart into God in a fuller way then any creature can let out it ſelfe to
another creature. Suppoſe all the creatures in the world ſhould have their
beauty and excellency put together in one, and preſent it ſelf wholly unto
thee to be an object of thy delight, yet it were not poſſible that thou ſhouldſt
communicate thy ſelf ſo fully to it, as thy ſoul will communicate it ſelfe to
God upon thy converſion. The ſoul gives up it ſelfe to God, as into an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
ocean of goodneſſe, ſo as it would not retaine any thing of its owne, as
a drop of water into a tun of wine, it retains not its ſavour or colour that it
had before, but it is as it were turned into wine. And hereby you may know
whether your converſion be right yea or no, As that which is Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to be thine, ſo that which is thine cometh again to be Chriſts. <hi>My be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
is mine, and I am his,</hi> ſaith the Church. Hence it is that the honour
that Chriſt the Husband hath, reflects upon the Saints; they ſhine with the
brightneſſe of his beams. <hi>Eſay 43. 4. Since thou waſt precious in my ſight
thou becameſt honourable.</hi> It was wont to be the cuſtome among the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes
in their marriages, when the wife was brought home, ſhe had this
ſpeech,<note place="margin">The Saints partake of Chriſts ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and they are an honor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt.</note> Where you are <hi>Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>us,</hi> I am <hi>Caja.</hi> How meane ſoever the woman
was before, yet being married, ſhe partakes of the honour of her husband.
So the Saints, whatſoever they were before, they are now looked upon as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
in the eyes of the Father, in the eyes of Chriſt, in the eyes of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghoſt, aud in the eyes of the Angels and the reſt of the Saints, who are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to diſcerne their excellency. And ſo on the other ſide, (for ſtill it is mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all)
as the Church hath honour from the luſtre of the beams of Chriſts glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
ſo even the Church is a glory unto Chriſt. As the Scripture ſaith, <hi>The
wife is the glory of the man.</hi> (which place heretofore you have had opened
unto you) ſo the truth is, the Church is the glory of Chriſt. How is that?
you will ſay: It is true, Chriſt is the glory of the Church, but that the Church
who is a company of poore creatures ſhould be the glory of Chriſt, how can
that be? yes, it is ſo, Chriſt accounteth himſelfe glorified before the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that he hath ſuch a Spouſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="434" facs="tcp:42662:221"/>
Mark that place, 2 <hi>Cor. 8. 23. Whether you inquire of Titus, he is my part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,

23. the Church is ſaid to be <hi>the fulneſſe of him that filleth all in all.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
we are to be low in our own eies, yet this is certaine, that it is the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of Chriſt before the Father and the bleſſed Angels, that he hath ſuch a
Spouſe as he hath. Hence <hi>Rev. 21. 9. Come, Behold the Bride, the Lambs
wife:</hi> The very Angels rejoice in this, <hi>O come, behold the Bride, the Lambs
wife.</hi> Certainly had it not been for the glory of Chriſt, the Angels would

even ſprings againe to preſent his Church unto his Father, Father here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
my Spouſe that I have married unto my ſelfe. It is true, a childe may
ſometimes marry againſt his fathers conſent, ſuch a one as he may be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to think of bringing to his fathers houſe, becauſe ſhe will be a diſgrace
to his father and his friends: But how mean and ſinfull ſoever we are in our
ſelves, when once we are betrothed unto Chriſt, he will not thinke it any
diſhonour, no not before his Father, that he hath ſuch a Spouſe, but he will
account it his glory before him and the bleſſed Angels, that he hath betro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
her unto himſelf.<note place="margin">Afflictions are mutual betweene Chriſt and his Church</note> And again, this communion makes the Afflictions
of Chriſt the Churches afflictions, and the afflictions of the Church the afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Chriſt. There is a communion in evill things as well as in good. The
very ſins of the Church come to be charged upon Chriſt; as a woman that
was in debt before maryage and ſo ſubject to arreſts, if ſhe be once mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſhe is no more troubled with the Serjeants, none can arreſt her, but all the
debts are charged upon the man: ſo though we be in debt, owing a debt of
puniſhment becauſe we have not payed the debt of obedience, and while we
are out of Chriſt, before this bleſſed marriage, we may feare every moment
to have ſome ſergeant of the Lord upon us to arreſt us, to hale us to priſon,
there to lye untill we have paid the uttermoſt farthing; but when the ſoul is
married unto Chriſt, all debts, all ſinnes are all tranſacted upon Chriſt, all
charged upon him, if the law come now and require ſatisfaction, if juſtice
comes you may ſend them unto your husband to anſwer all, and he will not
take it ill. A husband perhaps may take it ill, and thinke he hath brought
himſelf to miſery, when arreſts come upon him for his wives debts, it may
take off his heart from her, but Chriſt will never love you the worſe for all
your debts when they are charged upon him, he will willingly ſatisfie them,
and he will rejoyce in the ſatisfaction of them before his Father. And if there
be any affliction befall you, Chriſt is afflicted with you. <hi>Eſay 63. 9. In all
their afflictions be was afflicted.</hi> So on the other ſide, all the afflictions of
Chriſt are the afflictions of the Church; doth Chriſt ſuffer? you take it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
heart as if it were your own ſuffering. Chriſt takes your ſufferings unto
heart, as if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

                  <pb n="435" facs="tcp:42662:221"/>
And you take the ſufferings of Chriſt unto heart as if they were your owne.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In a married condition there is a mutuall intire love. That is,</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Intire love in a marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in three things.</note> loving the perſon more then what cometh from him. True conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
love is pitched upon the perſons mutually, rather then upon the eſtates,
or any thing they enjoy by the perſon. So on Chriſts part, his love is pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the perſons of the Saints, Chriſt loves your perſons more then al
your actions. It is true, all theſe gracious actions you doe are lovely before
Chriſt, for they ate the fruits of his ſpirit, but know, the pitch of Chriſts love
is upon your perſons chiefly. So the pitch of your love, if it be a right con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugall
love, is upon the perſon of Chriſt rather then upon any thing that
comes from him; thou ſeeſt him altogether lovely in himſelfe, beſides thoſe
riches of pardon of ſin and precious promiſes that thou enjoyeſt by him, his
perſon is that which ſatisfies thy ſoule.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, In priſing the love each of other, true love can be ſatisfied witht
nothing elſe but love, love villifies every thing that is tendered, except it
comes as a fruit of love, and if there be love, a little is highly prized, if it be
but a cup of cold water, it is more then a kingdome without it, the giving the
body to be burned is nothing without it. I will give you two Scriptures,
one wherein the Saints prize Gods love, the other wherein God prizes the
Saints love, <hi>Pſal. 36. 7. How excellent is thy loving kindneſſe O God.</hi> Pſal.

will ſet him on high.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, This intire love is a love in all conditions. Chriſt loves his Church
in their afflictions as intirely as he doth out of their afflictions. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 10.
<hi>He found him in a deſart land, and in the waſt howling wilderneſſe, he led
him about, he inſtructed him, hee kept him as the apple of his eye.</hi> Marke,
they were in the <hi>wilderneſſe,</hi> in the <hi>waſt howling wilderneſſe,</hi> yet even there
they were deare unto Chriſt, they were kept <hi>as the apple of his eye.</hi> The
Church on the other ſide looks upon Chriſt in his afflictions as lovely ſtill as
ever, <hi>Cant. 1. 12. A bundle of myrrhe is my well beloved unto me, he ſhal lie
all night betwixt my breaſts.</hi> Myrrhe is a bitter thing, yet the Church profeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that Chriſt though bitter in his afflictions, ſhould lie as lovely betweene
her breaſts as a bundle of myrrhe. I remember <hi>Herodotus</hi> reports of one
<hi>Artemeſia,</hi> Queen of Halicarnaffus (and <hi>Plinie</hi> ſpeaks ſomething of her
too) when her husband was dead, ſhe took his aſhes &amp; drank it in wine out
of reſpect to him though dead. The Church loveth a crucified Chriſt as
well as a glorified Chriſt. A moſt notable example of the love of a Spouſe
to her husband wee have in our Engliſh Chronicle, <hi>Elenor</hi> the wife of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
the firſt, the King having got a wound by a poyſoned dagger, ſhe to
ſhew the intire love ſhe bare to her husband, becauſe ſhe thought if the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
did ſtay a while in the wound there would be no cure, therefore with her
own mouth ſhe ſucked out the poyſon that was in the wound, &amp; ſo ventured
the loſſe of her own life to preſerve her husbands. Here was love in a Spouſe
to her husband. There is the like love of the Church unto Chriſt, if Chriſt
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:42662:222"/>
be wounded with the poyſonous tongues of ungodly men in reproaches and
blaſphemies,<note place="margin">Vtinam dominus avertat adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rios ab ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſia &amp; in me om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia ſua tela con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertant, meo ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quine ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im ſuam expleant. <hi>Ambr.</hi>
                  </note> let him be never ſo perſecuted in the world, they that are tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
gracious are willing to ſuck in that very poyſon to themſelves, ſo they
may take it from him. Let the reproaches of Chriſt fall upon me, O let me
ſuffer rather then Chriſt. It was <hi>Ambroſe</hi> his wiſh, Oh that God would
turne all the adverſaries of the Church upon me, that they might turne all
their weapons upon me, and ſatisfie their thirſt with my blood, this is the
diſpoſition of a true ſpouſe of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The fourth is unſpeakable delight; communion hath delight: the greateſt
communion, the greateſt delight: the greateſt delight that God hath is to
communicate himſelfe, to his Son firſtly, and next in letting out himſelfe to
his Saints. If there be delight in God in letting out himſelf to the Saints, in
reaſon one would thinke there muſt needs be delight in the Saints, in letting
themſelves out into God, in flowing into God. God takes ſuch delight in
letting out his mercy to his Saints, as that he was well pleaſed with the death
of his own Son as a meanes conducing thereunto. One would thinke that
the death of Chriſt ſhould be the moſt abhorring to the heart of God of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> thing in the world,<note place="margin">Mutual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Chriſt and the Saints.</note> yet the Scripture ſaith God was <hi>well pleaſed</hi> with it,
<hi>Eſay,</hi> 53. 10. Why was God pleaſed with it? Becauſe the Lord ſaw this
was the way for him to communicate himſelf in the fulneſſe of his grace un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Church, and therefore though it coſt him ſo deare as the death of his
own Son, yet he was well pleaſed with it. And as for Chriſt, he takes delight
in letting out himſelf to his people, after he had ſuffered, the Text ſaith, <hi>he
was ſatisfied when he ſaw of the travell of his ſoul.</hi> As if Chriſt had ſaid, O
let me have a Church to communicate my ſelf unto, though I ſee it hath coſt
me my blood, it hath coſt me all theſe fearfull ſufferings, yet I am ſatisfied,
I thinke all is well beſtowed, ſo I may have a people to partake of my love
and mercy for ever. <hi>Cant. 4. 9. Thou haſt raviſhed my heart, my ſiſter,
my ſpouſe, thou haſt raviſhed my heart with one of thine eyes.</hi> Then for the
Saints, the delight they have in communicating themſelves unto Chriſt is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utterable.
<hi>Stay me with flaeggons, comfort me with apples, for I am ſick of
love,</hi> ſaith the Church, <hi>Cantic, 2. 5. Pſal. 63. 5. My ſoul ſhall be ſatisfied
with marrow and fatneſſe, and my mouth ſhall praiſe thee with joyfull lips,
when I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate of thee in the night wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Take this note, the more fully you lay out your ſelves for Chriſt, the
more comfort you ſhall have in your lives. Here is the great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
hypocrites and others in the comfort of their lives. It is impoſſible
that any hypocrite can have that comfort in his life as a gracious heart can
have, upon this ground, becauſe a hypocrite reſerveth ſomewhat of himſelf
for ſomething elſe, there is not a full comunication of himſelf unto Chriſt,
he alwayes keepes ſomewhat back and thereby loſeth his comfort: But a
gracious heart fully letting out himſelfe into Chriſt, from thence cometh the
comfort, &amp; ſweetneſs that he hath in the ways of Chriſt above all hypocrites
in the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="437" facs="tcp:42662:222"/>
Perhaps you thinke that the onely comfort you can have is by receiving
ſome benefit, ſome mercy from God, you are much miſtaken, the comfort
of letting your hearts out to God, is a greater comfort then any comfort you
have in receiving any thing from God.</p>
               <p>And now, Oh how happy are they unto whom Chriſt is thus eſpouſed!
How comfortably may you live being made ſure to Chriſt? and how com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably
may you die? It is our work to ſeeke to draw ſoules to Chriſt, to
allure ſoules to be in love with him. <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 35. You may ſee what courſe
<hi>Abrahams</hi> ſervant took in drawing the love of <hi>Rebekah</hi> and her friends to
his Maſters ſon, he begins wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and that the Lord had bleſſed his Maſter greatly, ſo that he was become
great, and that the Lord had given him flocks, and herds, and ſilver, &amp; gold,
and that he had an onely ſoone that was to be heire of all this. This is the
work of Miniſters, to tell people what riches of mercy there are in God, and
that all the treaſures of thoſe infinite riches of the infinite God are in JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS
CHRIST and to be let out in him, this gaines the heart. Yea it is
not onely the work of Miniſters, but it ſhould be worke of every gracious
heart thus to ſeek to draw ſouls to Chriſt, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 17. not onely the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi>
there ſay <hi>Come,</hi> but the <hi>Bride</hi> ſaith <hi>Come, and let him that hea eth ſay
Come, and let him that is a thirſt come, and whoſoever will let him take the
water of life freely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VVere I not in ſuch a way of explication as I am, ſurely wee could not
get off ſuch a point as this; but that which I ſhall ſay for the preſent is onely
this. Know that it is not want of any worth in you that can hinder commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with Jeſus Chriſt, doe not reaſon in that manner. I am a poor wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſinfull creature, will ever Chriſt be married unto me? It is not thy ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
it is not thy baſe condition that can hinder thee; Chriſt never joynes
himſelfe to any becauſe they are worthy, but he joynes himſelf to them that
they may be worthy, hee makes them to be worthy in joyning himſelfe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them. The woman is not married unto the King, becauſe ſhe is a Queen,
but the King maryeth her, to make her a Queene. And further know, if
your hearts be not taken with Chriſt to joyne with him in his holy mariage,
if he be not your husband to enjoy conjugall communion with you, he will
be your judge to condemn you. But beſides this betrothing between Chriſt
&amp; a ſoul, there is a betrothing between Chriſt &amp; a viſible Church, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Church of the Jews when they ſhall be called.</p>
               <p>God ſhal appeare in his glory when this maryage ſhall be between Chriſt
and the Jewiſh Church, the King will then be in his Robes, if a man of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
have a ſonne to marry,<note place="margin">Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mar rying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the Church of the Iews.</note> and intends to ſolemnize the maryage accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his eſtate, if he have any better cloathes then other, he puts them on
that day; ſo at the calling of the Jewes, the King of heaven will be in
his robes; God will appeare in a moſt glorious manner to the world then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>he
did ſince the creation. Yea and you know the Bridegroome too will be
very fine upon the mariage day; ſo Jeſus Chriſt will then appeare,
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:42662:223"/>
(whether perſonally or otherwiſe wee ſay not) but certainly hee will glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
appeare at that day. <hi>Tit. 2. 15. We looke for the glorious appearance

Chriſt, the great doctrine of juſtification by Chriſt ſhall be made out full
and cleare. Yea and the creatures, her ſervants, ſhall put on the beſt ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as in a great marriage the ſervants in the houſe have new cloathes, at
that day there will be a change in all the creatures, and another kind of face
in the world then now there is. Then will be the marriage ſupper, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
ſhall thoſe be that ſhall then be found worthy to enter into the bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
let us now love Chriſt, let us now cleave to him, let us now ſuffer for
him; we may perhaps be ſome of thoſe, who beſide our eternal enjoyment of
chriſt in heaven, may enjoy him in this mariage upon the earth. But we muſt
leave this argument, we ſpake ſomething of it in the end of the firſt chapter.</p>
               <p>And I will betroth thee unto me for ever.</p>
               <p>[<hi>For ever.</hi>] This adds to the mercy to make it glorious, this [<hi>for ever</hi>]
makes a miſery though never ſo little, an infinite miſery, and a mercy, an
infinite mercy. This betrothing <hi>for ever,</hi> ſhall be fulfilled in a viſible church
communion to the Jewes, and in the ſpirituall communion of Chriſt with
the ſoule for the preſent. Of the viſible form firſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iſa. 60. 15. I will make thee an eternall excellency, a joy of many gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</hi>
I thinke this is not onely meant concerning the ſpiritual happines of
the Saints, but that God hath a time to make his viſible church to be an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
excellency, and a joy of many generations, an excellency that ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have an end. And this their perpetuall condition, their enduring happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
ſhall ariſe from three grounds.</p>
               <p>Firſt, from the precious foundation that ſhall be laid upon that Church
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> when it ſhall be.<note place="margin">The grounds of the endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Church.</note> 
                  <hi>Iſa. 54. 8. With everlaſting kindneſſe will I have mercy
on thee, ſaith the Lord;</hi> but mark the ground, <hi>verſ. 11. Behold I lay the
foundation with Saphires;</hi> all the rubbiſh ſhal be taken away, it ſhal not be
raiſed upon a rubbiſh foundation. God will lay the foundations of it with
Saphires, and then with everlaſting mercy he will embrace that Church.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that Church ſhall be in a peaceable condition, no rent, no divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> there, therefore in a perpetuall condition. <hi>Eſay 33. 20. A Tabernacle
that ſhall not be taken down, not one of the ſtakes thereof ſhall ever be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:</hi>
Why? the very words before ſhew the reaſon, <hi>Jeruſalem ſhall be a
quiet habitation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, this Church ſhall look wholly at Chriſt as their Judge, and their
Law-giver, and their King. <hi>Iſa. 33. 22. The Lord is our Judge, the Lord
is our Law-giver, the Lord is our King.</hi> Churches are ready to change,
while they mixe other things with the worſhip of Chriſt, and the lawes of
men with his laws; but when they can look to him, I mean in that which is
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:42662:223"/>
ſpirituall, as their Law-giver, as their Judge, and as their King, then the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe
of it ſhall be perpetuall never to ceaſe in this world, the Lord Chriſt
will betroth this Church unto him for ever.</p>
               <p>Though I verily think the holy Ghoſt aymeth at this in great part, yet
we are to underſtand this <hi>betrothing for ever,</hi> further of the ſpirituall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
the ſoul hath with Chriſt. When Chriſt betroths himſelfe unto a
ſoule, it is <hi>for ever;</hi> the conjugall love of Chriſt with a gracious ſoule ſhal
never be broken: At the firſt, mans condition was ſuch, as man laid hold
upon God, and let goe his hold; but now God lays hold upon man, and hee
will never let goe his. The bond of union in a believer runs through Jeſus
Chriſt, it is faſtned upon God, and the ſpirit of God holds the other end of
it, and ſo it can never be broken; This union is in the Father who hath laid
<hi>a ſure foundation,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 19. Rom. 9. 11. In the Son who <hi>loves his to
the end, Iohn</hi> 13. 1. In the Spirit, who <hi>abides in the elect for ever, John</hi>
14. 16, 17. <hi>Eſay 54. 10. The mountains ſhall depart, and the hills be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
but my kindneſſe ſhall not depart from thee, neither ſhall the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of my peace be removed, ſaith the Lord that hath mercy on thee.</hi> My
loving kindneſſe ſhall be more ſtable with thee, and endure longer then the
mountains themſelves. It is as ſure as the ordinances of heaven. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 35,
36. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, which giveth the Sun for a light by day, and the
ordinances of the Moon and of the Stars for a light by night, if thoſe ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
dopart from before mee, then the ſeed of Iſrael ſhall ceaſe, &amp;c.</hi> And
<hi>Jer. 33. 20, 21. Thus ſaith the Lord, if you can break my covenant of the
day, and my covenant of the night, that there ſhould not be day and night in
their ſeaſon, then may alſo my covenant be broken with David my ſervant.</hi>
You have theſe three expreſſions of the abiding of Gods love to his people.</p>
               <p>1. The continuance of the mountains. 2. The continuance of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
of heaven and earth. 3. Gods covenant with night and day. Here
is the bottome of conſolation to the Saints, <hi>They ſhall be kept by the power of
God, 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 5. As if God ſhould ſay, the ſpeciall power that I meane to
put forth in this world, ſhall be to uphold the ſpirits of my Saints, to bring
them to ſalvation, certainly it is ſo. The ſpeciall work that God hath in this
world to exerciſe his power about, is to keep Chriſt and the Saints together.</p>
               <p>Though it be through Gods power that the heavens and the earth be kept
up, yet if God muſt withdraw his power from one, hee would rather with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
it from upholding heaven and earth, then from upholding one gracious
ſoule that hath union with his Son.</p>
               <p>The union that is between Chriſt and his people, it is too neere an union
ever to be broken.<note place="margin">Sicut imposſibile eſt fermentom mixum a paſta ſeparari, quia immutabit paſtae na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turam, it a imposſibile Chriſtianus rapi a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Christo, quia eſt in eis Chriſtus fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, it a incorporatus, ut unum ſit corpus, una maſſa. <hi>Luth.</hi>
                  </note> I remember <hi>Luther</hi>
hath a notable expreſſion about this: As
it is impoſſible for the leaven that is in the
dough to be ſeparated from the dough,
after it is once mixed, for it turneth the
nature of the dough into it ſelfe; ſo it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible,
ſaith he, for the Saints ever to be ſeparated from Chriſt:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="440" facs="tcp:42662:224"/>
For Chriſt is in the Saints as neerly as the leaven in the very dough, ſo incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated
as that Chriſt and they are as it were one lump. Chriſt who came to
ſave that which was loſt, will never loſe that which he hath ſaved. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.
16. it is ſaid that Chriſt was made a Prieſt <hi>not after the law of a carnall
commandement:</hi> That is, he was not made a Prieſt as the Prieſts in the law,
after a ceremonial way, <hi>but after the power of a indiſſoluble life: Coeli vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>
                  </note>
by a celeſtiall vertue, ſo <hi>Calvin</hi> upon the place. The argument why
Chriſts life is indiſſoluble, rather then the Prieſts in the law, is becauſe they
were made by the power of a carnall commandement, not by a Celeſtiall
power. So thoſe who profeſſe godlineſſe according to a carnall comande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in a ceremoniall way, may faile, vaniſh, and come to nothing in their
way of worſhip as many have done; but ſuch as are profeſſors of Religion
by the vertue of Gods Spirit in them, they have the power of a life indiſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble.
There are two ſoul-ſtaying and ſoul-ſatisfying grounds to aſſure of
Chriſts betrothing himſelfe for ever.</p>
               <p>Firſt, when any ſoul is taken in to Chriſt, it hath not onely all the ſinnes
that it hath committed heretofore pardoned,<note place="margin">Two ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaying and ſoul-ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying grounds for perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.</note> but there is a pardon laid in for
all ſin that is to come. There is <hi>forgiveneſſe with thee, Pſal.</hi> 130. 4. There
lyes pardon with God before hand for all that is to come, as well as for that
which is paſt. <hi>There is no condemnation unto them which are in Chriſt
Jeſus, Rom.</hi> 8. 1. That is, there is no inſtant of time after they are once in
Chriſt Jeſus wherein it can be ſaid they are under the ſentence of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Now were it not that there were a pardon laid before-hand for all ſin
that is to come, there might upon commiſſion of a new ſinne be ſaid at that
time, that now they are under condemnation; for if the leaſt ſin be not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned,
there is condemnation: but this cannot be. I do not ſay the ſin is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
before it is comitted, for that is a harſh &amp; improper ſpeech: for when
we ſpeake of pardoning ſin, we ſpeak of a work applyed to the creature, not
of that which is in God: a pardon is laid up to be applyed by God when e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the ſin is commited, ſo that there ſhal be no inſtant of time wherein the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
is unpardoned, &amp; ſo under condemnation. Then ſurely he can never fall
off from Chriſt; for what doth endanger the falling off from Chriſt, but
commisſion of ſin? Chriſt hath as well merited at the hand of God pardon
for any ſin that is to come, as he hath merited pardon for ſin paſt; do not ſay
this opens a gap to licentiouſneſſe, then we need not care; No, the grace of
Chriſt hath no ſuch malignity in it, in ſaying thus thou ſpeakeſt againſt thy
life. The ſecond ſoul-ſtaying argument for perſeverance is, that perſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
is a ſpiritual mercy purchaſed by Chriſt as well as any grace, <hi>Epheſ.</hi>
1. 3. <hi>Bleſſed be God who hath bleſſed us with all ſpiritual blesſings in Jeſus
Chriſt.</hi> Now you will ſay, Faith is a blesſing, and Humility is a bleſſing,
and Joy is a blesſing we have in Chriſt, why is not Perſeverance a blesſing,
a ſpirituall blesſing too? Chriſt hath as truely and as really layd down his
bloud to purchaſe the perſeverance, as to purchaſe thy pardon, as to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
any thing he hath purchaſed for thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="441" facs="tcp:42662:224"/>
That which Chriſt hath laid down his blood to purchaſe, ſurely muſt be
had, the purchaſe of Chriſts blood ſhall not be fruſtrate. Is there any thing
thou haſt by vertue that purchaſe? Thou mayeſt be as ſure of perſeverance,
for Chrſt hath laid down his blood to purchaſe that alſo.</p>
               <p>Chriſtian then ſatisfie thy ſoul in this, God gives the comforts in this world,
but he gives them not for ever, but when he betrotheth thee unto his Son he
betrotheth thee for ever. Perhaps the Lord in mercy hath made thy life
here in this thy pilgrimage very comfortable in giving thee a comfortable
meet yoke-fellow, in this thy betrothing thou art happy, but this happineſſe
is not for ever, thou canſt looke upon thy yoke-fellow as a mercy of God
unto thee, that makes thy pilgrimage ſweet, but there muſt be a diſſolution
between thee and her; but thy union with thy Husband Chriſt is for ever,
there ſhall never be diſſolution of that. Perhaps ſome of you have loſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
yoke-fellowes, death hath come and ſnapt aſunder the union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
you, and you complain <hi>never woman loſt</hi> ſuch a husband, never man
loſt ſuch a wife as I have, if you be godly you have a husband that you ſhall
never loſe, it is he that will fill up relations, he ſaith, <hi>Thy maker is thy hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
Eſay,</hi> 54. 5.</p>
               <p>And further, this is mutuall, <hi>I will betroth thee unto me for ever,</hi> &amp; I will
give thee a heart that thou ſhalt cleave unto me for ever. This will afford
unto us another uſefull meditation, <hi>viz.</hi> When the Lord chooſeth any ſoule
to himſelfe, as he ſetteth his own heart for ever upon thar ſoul, ſo he gives un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

God, there ſhall be no diſſimulation betwixt you and me, I will deale with

48. 1. <hi>They make mention of the God of Iſrael, but not in truth nor
in righteouſneſſe,</hi> one expounds the other, I will receive you againe
though you have departed from me, in the very integrity of my ſoule, doe
not feare me, doe not ſuſpect me, doe not thinke though he make a ſhew of
love unto mee, and of great favour, yet hee intendeth to caſt mee off at laſt:
Theſe are the jealous thoughts of many troubled conſciences. Indeed I
heare of mercy, and God is working toward me as if he intended mercy
to me, but I am afraid he will caſt me off in the concluſion; No ſaith God,
do not feare, do not ſuſpect me, this mercy I offer is <hi>bona fide,</hi> it is in the
very truth of my heart, therefore let there not be ſuch ſuſpitious thoughts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
you and me, you may be ſure that what is fit and right for you to have
from ſuch a husband as I am, that doth belong to ſuch a Spouſe as I profeſſe
to take you to be, you ſhall certainly have it, you need not be afraid, for
you ſhall have plain and upright dealing with me. This I take to bee one
part though not all of the meaning of the holy Ghoſt here, <hi>I will betroth thee
unto me in righteouſneſſe,</hi> that love I profeſſe to you I do not do it to mock
you ſaith God, but I do it in truth. From whence the notes which are very
uſefull may be,</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> guilty hearts are full of ſuſpitions of Gods reall meaning in all his
expreſſions of love and mercy. They judge God by themſelves. As they
firſt ſlight ſinne, becauſe they judg of God by themſelves, they ſee not ſuch
a dreadful evill in ſinne, they think God ſees it not: ſo after they have ſinned,
they judge of Gods mercy by their own, they think thus; if any had offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
us ſo as we have offended God, though we might ſay wee would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
to him, yet wee could not bring our hearts fully to come off to it,
ſomething would remain in our hearts, they therefore think ſo of God, they
ſuſpect God that he doth not mean really in his expreſſions of love and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to them. But take heed of this, doe not judge of God by your ſelves,
though you have a baſe and cruell heart, and cannot be reconciled to thoſe
that provoke you; it is not therefore ſo with God. There are theſe two e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
in ſin, firſt in the nature of it there is a departing from God; ſecondly, it
cauſeth jealouſies and ſuſpitions of God, and ſo hinders the ſoul from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unto God again.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> God is very carefull to prevent all theſe ſuſpitions in the hearts
of his people. God deſires that you ſhould have good thoughts of him, and
this is that we plead with you for, and do often open the riches of Gods grace
to this end that you may have good thoughts of God, and to take off your
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:42662:225"/>
jealouſies and ſuſpitions of him, as if there were no reall intention in all the
proffers of mercy he makes to you; doe not thinke that all thoſe riches of
Gods grace are meer words, they are certaine intentions of Gods heart to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
you. <hi>I will betroth thee unto me in righteouſneſſ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for your parts, I will give you a heart, you ſhall return to mee <hi>bona
fide,</hi> you ſhal do it in the plainneſſe of your hearts. There was a time indeed,
as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 34, 35, 36. God complained of his people that they ſought him
and returned unto him, <hi>nevertheleſſe they did flatter with their mouth,
and lyed unto him with their tongues,</hi> there was no reality in their returning
unto him, they made great promiſes, that whatſoever God ſhould ſay unto
them they would do it, but there was no reality in it, yea but ſaith God,
there ſhall come a time that you ſhall have righteous hearts, and that which
you promiſe to me you ſhall promiſe really, there ſhall not be that falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in your hearts, thoſe ſhews and overtures that were heretofore, but you
ſhall return to me with all your hearts in righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>God hath made adoe at firſt with us to make us believe that he is in good
earneſt with us in his proffers o<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> mercy;<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> and much adoe there is before our
hearts can be gotten to work towards God in good earneſt.</p>
               <p>Further note, this is one reaſon why God doth betroth <hi>for ever,</hi> becauſe
he doth it in the plainneſſe of his heart; and this is alſo a good reaſon why
the Saints continue for ever, becauſe what they do to God is in the plainneſs
of their hearts. Thoſe who return to God in an hypocriticall way, will fall
off, but they that return in uprighteneſſe will hold conſtant with him, <hi>Prov.</hi>
8. 18. it is ſaid of Wiſdome, that <hi>with her are durable riches and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi>
they are put together; where there is true righteouſneſſe in the heart,
there is durable riches.</p>
               <p>But yet there is another thing in this <hi>betrothing in righteouſneſſe,</hi> and that
I thinke hath more in it then the former. God will be ſo reconciled to his
Church, as yet he will manifeſt himſelf to be a righteous God. In the works
of the riches of his grace he will manifeſt the glory of his juſtice too; I will
doe it <hi>in righteouſneſſe,</hi> though indeed the Lord intendeth to glorifie rich
grace, yet ſo as he will declare his righteouſneſſe to men and Angels, that
in this very work of his he ſhall be acknowledged by them unto all eternity
to bee a righteous God; GOD will make ſuch a way for this his love and
goodneſſe as that hee will have ſatisfaction to his juſtice in it. That place,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25, 26. is remarkable for our purpoſe; <hi>Whom God hath ſet forth to
be a propitiation through faith in his blood;</hi> How? <hi>To declare his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
for the remisſion of ſinnes.</hi> Marke it, it is not that he had ſet forth
Chriſt to be a propitiation, to declare his mercy in the forgiveneſſe of ſins;
you will ſay, What is there in the forgiveneſſe of ſins but only the mercy of
God? Yes, there is ſomewhat elſe, there is righteouſneſſe too, and the
Lord doth declare his righteouſneſſe in the forgiveneſſe of ſins, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is that he hath ſet forth Chriſt to be a propitiation, that hee might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
his righteouſneſſe. If the Lord ſhould have ſaid but thus, Well, you
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:42662:226"/>
are great and grievous ſinners, I will be content freely to forgive you all
your ſins, this would have declared Gods mercy, but not his righteouſneſſe:
but now when the Lord hath ſet forth Chriſt as a propitiation, and forgiveth
ſins through the blood of his Son, in this God declareth as much righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
as grace. This text <hi>Luther</hi> had a great deale of do to underſtand, and
he prayed much before he could get the right meaning of it; yea it is repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
again, <hi>To declare, I ſay, his righteouſneſſe, that he might be juſt, &amp; the
juſtifier of him that believeth in Jeſus;</hi> not that he might be mercifull in
juſtifying him that believeth in Jeſus, but that he might be juſt in juſtifying
him that believeth in Jeſus.</p>
               <p>And this is the great myſtery of the Goſpel, this is that which the Angels
pry into, the Saints and Angels ſhal admire &amp; bleſſe God to all eternity, for
the reconciling riches of mercy, and infinite juſtice both in one. This was that
which ſet the infinite wiſdome of God on worke from all eternity, how to
find a way to ſave ſinners, and to be infinitely righteous notwithſtanding.
If all the Angels in heaven, and all the men in the world had been put to it, to
find out a way to anſwer this queſtion, How ſhall ſin be pardoned, the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
reconciled unto God, and God glorifie his juſtice? they could never
have done it, but God in his infinite wiſdome hath found out a way to doe
it. This coſt God dear, it coſt him the heart blood of his own Son, and that
was a ſign that Gods heart was much in it, and indeed we are not Chriſtians
untill in ſome meaſure we ſee, and have our hearts taken with the glory of
God in this myſtery. We muſt looke at righteouſneſſe in our reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as well as to loving kindneſſe and mercy.</p>
               <p>When God is reconciled unto a ſinner, there is not only his mercy glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
but in that way that God hath found out to ſave a ſinner, hee hath the
glory of his juſtice as much, yea more then if the ſinner were eternally dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in hell.</p>
               <p>How is that you will ſay?</p>
               <p>I make that good three ways.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, when God appointed a ſurety, his Son, and charged his debt upon
him, to ſatisfie his juſtice, in that God would not ſpare this Sonne of his the
leaſt farthing token, I mean, not the leaſt degree of puniſhment, he would
not remit any thing to his Son, the Lord did hereby ſhew a ſtronger intenſe
love unto juſtice, then if he had damned tenne thouſand thouſand creatures
Suppoſe a malefactor comes before a Judg, the Judg will not ſpare the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor,
but requireth ſatisfaction to the law, this ſhews that the <hi>Judg</hi> loves
<hi>juſtice:</hi> but if the Iudges own ſon be a delinquent, and it appears before all
the Country that the Iudg will not ſpare him, but he muſt ſatisfie the law to
the uttermoſt, you will ſay the Iudge doth honour unto <hi>juſtice</hi> more in this,
then in condemning many other malefactors. So when the Lord ſhall caſt
many thouſands into hell, there to be tormented for ever, this ſheweth that
God loveth <hi>juſtice;</hi> but when his own Son ſhall take our ſins upon him, but
by imputation, &amp; God will not ſpare him (that is the very word of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>He ſpared not his own Sonn,</hi> ſaith the Text) this declareth Gods love to
righteouſneſs, more then if all the world had been damned.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="445" facs="tcp:42662:226"/>
Secondly, ſuppoſe the ſinner that is reconciled had been damned, then
the juſtice of God had been but in ſatisfying, and never had fully been ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
but in that way that God hath found out to ſave a ſinner, his juſtice is
not only ſatisfying, but it comes to be fully ſatisfied, to have enough. Now
it is a greater honour to juſtice to be fully ſatisfied, then to be in ſatisfying.</p>
               <p>As for inſtance, ſuppoſe a man be a Creditor to one who owes him five
thouſand pounds, this man is poore, and the utmoſt he can pay is but ſixe
pence, or twelve pence a weeke; ſuppoſe the Creditor ſhould lay him in the
Jayle untill he had payed all, this man would be paying, but would never be
payed ſo long as the Debtor liveth; but if another rich man ſhould come and
lay downe five thouſand pound at once, the man is preſently ſatisfied. Here
is the difference between Gods ſatisfying his juſtice upon ſinners, and upon
Jeſus Chriſt; God cometh upon the ſinner, he requireth the debt of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
becauſe he did not pay the debt of obedience, God caſt him into
priſon, the uttermoſt he can pay is but twelve pence a week as it were, that
is but a little, and thereforefore he muſt be ſtill paying and paying eternally,
which is the very ground of their eternall puniſhment in hell, becauſe they
cannot pay enough in any finite time: Now commeth Chriſt, and he fully
payes the debt, ſo that juſtice ſaith it hath enough, it is ſatisfied, this is the
greater glory to the juſtice of God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If the ſinner had been ſent down to hell, God had had the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of his juſtice paſſively upon him, hee ſhould be for ever under the power <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
and ſtroke of juſtice, but in the mean time the ſinner would have hated God
for his juſtice, and hated juſtice; but when juſtice is honoured actively, the
ſinner falleth down and acknowledgeth himſelfe guilty, putteth himſelfe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the ſtroake of Gods juſtice, and accepteth of the puniſhment of his ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity;
now God is delighted more abundantly in this active way of glorify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his <hi>juſtice,</hi> then if the ſinner ſhould have beene eternally in hell to have
ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>And now Devils and all wicked men muſt needs have their mouths ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
for ever, they cannot cry out of God becanſe he will marry himſelfe to
ſuch ſinners, this is mercy, but where is his righteouſneſs? where is the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of his juſtice? here is an anſwer to them all, though the Lord ſetteth his
love upon vile ſinners, yet ſo as hee doth it in righteouſneſſe. And this is a
great encouragement to come in and believe, as thus, if the ſinner be terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with the apprehenſion of his ſinne, I ſee by them the wrath of God is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed,
and infinite juſtice comes upon mee, and I heare that crying for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction;
this bids the ſinner know likewiſe, that God hath a way to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
infinite juſtice, and yet to ſave thy ſoul, he will marry thee unto himſelf,
and yet he will do it in righteouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>And this is a mighty helpe unto a ſinner againſt all faylings afterward, a
mighty eſtabliſhment againſt a thouſand objections the ſinner may make
againſt himſelf. Thus we muſt ſeek to God when wee ſeek for reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to be received againe when wee have departed from him, whatſoever
GOD doth for us, hee muſt doe it in the way of righteouſneſſe as well as
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:42662:227"/>
in the way of mercy. Take this with you ſinners, if ever you have a pardon
ſealed unto you, it muſt be ſealed in the Court of juſtice as well as in the
Court of mercy; therefore thou needeſt not appeale from the Court of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
to the Mercy-ſeat, for in that way of the myſtery of godlineſs that there
is in God reconciling himſelfe unto a ſinner, there may be as much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
in ſtanding before the bar of juſtice as at the Mercy-ſeat, that is, by ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
there, in and through Chriſt, for he hath made juſtice propitious to us,
and now it pleadeth to mercy for us.</p>
               <p>And indeed this is the very work of Faith, to go unto God this way, when
by Faith the ſinner ſhall tender up unto God the Father the righteouſneſs of
JESUS CHRIST for an atonement and ſatisfaction for ſins; It
brings the comfort of juſtification this way. When you come to God in
any other way but this, it is but in a natural way, not in a true evangelicall
way; A man by nature may know thus much, that when he hath ſinned he
muſt ſeek unto God for mercy, to pardon his ſin, or elſe he is miſerable; but
to ſeek unto God for pardon with a price in our hand, to tender up the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of Chriſt for a ſatisfaction to Divine juſtice, here is the myſtery of faith;
faith is not onely to rely upon Gods mercy for pardon, but this, I ſee riches
of grace in Chriſt, and Chriſt my ſurety hath made an atonement, hath laid
down a price, now by faith I tender up this unto God the Father, and by
this way I believe my ſoul ſhall be accepted in him.</p>
               <p>What a mighty ingagement is this for us to be righteous with God? the
Lord betrotheth us unto himſelf in righteouſneſſe, &amp; we ſhould give up our
ſelves to him in righteouſneſſe too. O my brethren, take this away with you,
what ever you forget; If the Lord hath thus ingaged himſelfe unto us in a
way of righteouſneſſe, and if it hath coſt him ſo deare to ſhew himſelf righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
unto us; what an infinite ingagement is this unto us to be righteous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

<hi>Luther</hi> carries it, and he ſaith that
judgement here is the ſecond pearle
of the Husbands ring he gives to his
Spouſe, God promiſeth to exerciſe
judgement &amp; vengeance againſt the
adverſaries of the Church, and ſo he
applyeth it unto thoſe times wherein he lived in <hi>Germany;</hi> ſaith he, for theſe
many years wicked Magiſtrates have oppreſſed the Church, and prophane
Doctors have corrupted the doctrine of it, but <hi>Germany</hi> hath ſeene God
judging his adverſaries.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="448" facs="tcp:42662:228"/>
And if we ſhould underſtand it in this ſenſe, we have a ſutable place, <hi>Eſay</hi>
54. 5. where God telleth his Church, that <hi>He that is her maker is her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
even the Lord of hoſts, and her Redeemer the God of the whole earth;</hi>
the word there is <hi>Vindex,</hi> the avenger, he that will avenge thee of thine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
is the God of the whole earth, he is thy husband. This might afford a
ſweet meditation, that the Lord will defend his Church from the rage of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries,
as the husband will defend his Spouſe being betrothed unto her;
the Lord certainly will take a valuable conſideration at the hands of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries
who wrong his Church. But this I thinke not to be the ſcope of the
place,</p>
               <p>Another is [<hi>In Judgement</hi>] Though things be now out of order, all
things ſeeme to be in confuſion, yet the time is coming when all things ſhal
be ordered in the Church according to equity and right.</p>
               <p>Theſe two I thinke are meant in the former Texts, <hi>I will convince the
world of judgement,</hi> that is, the world ſhall be convinced that Chriſt hath
all judgement committed unto him, and he ſhews it in this, that <hi>the Prince
of this world is judged;</hi> ſo that place before in <hi>Matthew, I will cauſe judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to returne unto victory,</hi> that is, though the adverſaries of the Church
be many, yet he will cauſe them all to be vanquiſhed, judgement ſhal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
over them all; though there be much oppoſition and confuſion in the
Church, yet I will bring all things in the Church to be ordered &amp; compoſed
in a right way according unto equity.</p>
               <p>That place likewiſe <hi>Eſay</hi> 4. 4. where the Lord ſaith, <hi>he will purge his
Church by the ſpirit of judge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ent and by the ſpirit of burning.</hi> I know ſome
carry it as if it were meant of the ſpirit of ſanctification, that is as fire to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
luſts, but rather thus, whereas there were ſuch as did oppreſſe the
Church by falſe judgement, the Lord would cleanſe the Church from wrong
and oppreſſion by giving a ſpirit of judgement unto thoſe that ſhould be the
Officers of it, and conſuming the adverſaries.</p>
               <p>But yet I thinke we have not the full ſcope of this place. I rather would
pitch upon this as that which is more principally intended, though the other
may be in ſome degree included, <hi>viz. I will betroth thee unto me in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
that is, there ſhall be a good reaſon for what I doe, that which I will
now do in betrothing thee unto my ſelfe ſhall not be out of raſhneſſe, it ſhal
not be done unadviſedly, but with underſtanding, with good deliberation,
I know what I do in it, and I know what glory I ſhall have by it, I will do
it in judgement.</p>
               <p>So I finde the word <hi>judgement</hi> taken in ſcripture, <hi>Jer. 4. 2. Thou ſhalt
ſweare in truth, in judgement, and in righteouſneſſe. In judgement,</hi> that is,
when you ſweare, know it is a worſhip of God, and you muſt doe it in
judgement, you muſt not only ſweare <hi>in truth,</hi> that is; ſweare to that which
is true, and <hi>in righteouſneſſe,</hi> that is, not to the wrong or prejudice of your
neighbour, for you may ſinne in ſwearing though you ſweare in truth if you
have an intent to wrong any; but thirdly you muſt ſweare <hi>in judgment</hi> too,
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:42662:228"/>
you muſt underſtand what you doe, that is, when you take an oath you muſt
know that it is not as the <hi>Ex Officio</hi> was, to ſweare to anſwer to every thing
that ſhall be asked you, but you muſt underſtand beforehand what you are
to ſweare to, and ſo ſweare out of judgement; So ſaith God, <hi>I will betroth
thee unto me in judgement,</hi> that is, I have conſidered what I am to doe in
this thing, and I doe it out of judgement. And for your parts when you ſhal
come and cloſe with me, in this bleſſed conjugall union and communion
you ſhall doe it out of jndgement too; <hi>I will betroth you in judgement</hi> ſo
as to make it appeare before the world that I had good reaſon ſo to do, and
you ſhall likewiſe cloſe with me as you ſhall be able to juſtifie it before men
and Angels, that you had reaſon for what you did, that it was out of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
There is nothing wherein there is more need of judgement then in
marriages &amp; contracts; therefore the heathens were wont to ſet <hi>Mercury,</hi>
there god of wiſdome, by <hi>Venus,</hi> their goddeſſe of maryage, to note that
there was need of judgement there, yet there is nothing uſually in the world
undertaken with leſſe judgement, with more raſhneſs and inconſideratneſs
then contracts and maryages, which is the reaſon of the trouble of their lives
ever after.<note place="margin">The match betweene Chriſt and his Spouſe is in rash things, it is out of judgement.</note> But though there be many contracts between men and women
that are not out of judgement, yet ſaith God <hi>I will betroth you out of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
Chriſts match with his Church is a match of judgment, Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidereth
of our meanneſs before he marryeth with us, hee knoweth us fully
what we are, he knowes our ſinfulneſs, our wretchedneſs, he knows, we are
in debt before he maryeth us, and whatſoever elſe we can think might be any
hinderance, he knowes as perfectly as ever he ſhall know it, &amp; yet he goes
on. Yea the match between Chriſt and his Church is that which hath been
plotting in Heaven from all eternity, it is not a ſudden, raſh match, it hath
been plotting between the Father and the Son from everlaſting. God the
Father giveth conſent to this match, God the Holy Ghoſt is ſent to draw the
hearts of his people to come in and conſent to this match, it is a match out
of the deepeſt judgement that ever thing was done.</p>
               <p>Though it be true that God can ſee no reaſon in us why we ſhould be thus
united to his Sonne, yet he can ſee abundance of reaſon in himſelf; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the converſion and ſalvation of a ſoul, is not only out of Gods mercy,
but it is from Gods wiſedome too, Hence the Scripture attributes our pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and our calling, unto his wiſdome as well as unto the freeneſs of

of his will.</hi> We indeed are ſet upon our wills many times to do a thing
&amp; there is no reaſon for it, there is no counſel of our will; but God even in
this thing that we can ſee no reaſon for at all, hee workes according to the
<hi>counſell of his will;</hi> and <hi>Ephe.</hi> 3. 10. the Apoſtle having ſaid before, <hi>verſ,</hi>
8. that he was <hi>to preach the unſearchable riches of Chriſt,</hi> he ſaith, he was
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:42662:229"/>
to preach it to the intent that now might be <hi>made known the manifold wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God.</hi> In all things in the Goſpel there is a great deale of wiſdome;
Vocation is one of the myſteries of the Goſpel, and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 24. the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
is ſaid to be <hi>the power of God and the wiſdome of God;</hi> the Apoſtle there
inſtances in one thing, which one would thinke hath as little reaſon in it as
any thing in the Goſpel, that is, the leaving of the rich, wiſe and noble, the
great ones of the world, and calling the poore; but herein is not onely the
power, but the wiſdome of God, God doth even this in judgement. And
although we can now underſtand little or nothing of any reaſon that there
can be of Gods chooſing us unto himſelfe; yet this will be made known at
the great day of judgement. It will be a great part of the glory of that day
for the Lord to make known the counſell of his will; we now know his will,
but we ſhall then know the counſell of his will, and praiſe him to all eternity
for it; this ſhall be the glory of the Saints, that they ſhall ſee into the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of Gods will in chooſing and calling them, and letting others goe.</p>
               <p>Gods betrothing himſelfe thus to his people <hi>in judgement,</hi> is an eſpeciall
reaſon of the perpetuity of this betrothing. <hi>I will betroth thee unto me for
ever;</hi> Why? Firſt, it is <hi>in righteouſneſſe,</hi> therefore it will hold. Secondly,
it is <hi>in judgement,</hi> therefore it will hold too. Things that are done raſhly will
ſeldome hold, but though we are ſet upon them for the preſent, we quickly
undoe them afterward, but that which is done in judgment holds; the calling
of a ſinner, and uniting him unto Chriſt, is done in judgement, therefore it
will hold, that is the ground of the perſeverance of a ſinner; If a man before
marryage knoweth perfectly all the faults his wife hath, or ever ſhall have,
and knowes perfectly her eſtate &amp; all the incumbrances he ſhall have with
her,<note place="margin">The Saints chuſe Chriſt out of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> yet loveth her out of judgement, ſurely this love will hold: It is ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Chriſt and his Church; Chriſt before he betrotheth his Church, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
knowes all the faults the Church hath, or ſhall have, all the ſins that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſhe ſhall commit, and all the incumbrances &amp; diſhonor ſhe ſhal have,
yet out of judgement he betroths her to himſelfe, therefore ſurely this will
hold. Comfort yourſelves with this Chriſtians, though there be many fayl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
after your comming to Chriſt, Chriſt knew them all before you were
united to him, yet out of judgement he betrothed himſelfe unto you.</p>
               <p>There muſt alſo be <hi>judgement</hi> on our parts; I will put into you a judicious
heart, to chooſe me out of judgement. The Saints who chooſe Chriſt, know
what they doe. <hi>They ſhall be all taught of God; every one therefore that
hath heard, and learned of the Father, commeth unto me;</hi> None cometh
unto me,<note place="margin">Chriſtas eſt novi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas ſemper renovan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da.</note> but ſuch as are taught of God, who heare &amp; learne of the Father,
they come to me out of judgement; <hi>I know whom I have loved,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi>
and ſo may every Chriſtian ſay. They doe not come to imbrace Chriſt and
his wayes out of novelty, becauſe they are new things, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o not any truth of
Chriſt, out of meer novelty as many doe, and ſo vaniſh to nothing; though
it is true, there is alwayes ſome new excellency in Chriſt, I meane new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
revealed; Chriſt hath alwayes ſomething that is further revealed more
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:42662:229"/>
then we knew before, and delightful I he is in that regard, if we love novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
It is not a ſufficient plea againſt any truth, becauſe it is now revealed, and
was not known before; 2 <hi>Pet. 1. 12. Be eſtabliſhed in the preſent truth:</hi>
though truths be from the beginning yet there are preſent truths in regard of
manifeſtation: But the Saints muſt not therefore receive them, meerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are new to them, neither muſt any reject them, becauſe they are
but now cleared, whereas before they lay in the darke; but all out of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
we muſt examine them, when any truth is preſented, though it ſeems
new, becauſe you heard not of it before, reject it not upon that, neither im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
it upon that, but try it, and when you are convinced, then out of
judgement imbrace it. Neither muſt the Saints follow God, or any way of
truth, meerly from the example of others, but out of their owne judgements.
Perhaps you ſee ſuch and ſuch, of whom you have a reverent eſteeme, and
that juſtly doe thus and thus; I confeſſe, that is enough to put you upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining,
to bethinke your ſelves, ſurely there is ſomething in it, or elſe it is
not like they would do it, but that muſt not be the onely reaſon, but if upon
examination you finde it to be good, then embrace it out of judgement, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
reſt untill you come to that that the men of <hi>Samaria</hi> ſaid to the woman,
<hi>Now we believe that this is the Meſſiah, not becauſe of thy ſayings,</hi> becauſe
you told us ſo, <hi>but we have heard him our ſelves, and we know that he is
indeed the Saviour of the world.</hi> At the firſt they came to Chriſt upon
her relation, but they did not beleeve in Chriſt, but upon ſeeing and hearing
Chriſt themſelves. You may come to examine the wayes, the truthes of
God upon the relation and example of others, but you muſt not ingage your
hearts in them untill you ſee the reality of them your ſelves.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, you muſt embrace Chriſt and his wayes out of judgement, not
out of ſudden flaſhes of affection; ſuddeu flaſhes goe out as ſoone as they
come. You have a notable example for this, <hi>Luke 14. 15. Happy are they
that may eate bread in the Kingdome of God:</hi> O this is bleſſed doctrine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.
But by that which followes we may finde that they were ſuch as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
went to their Farmes and to their Oxen, and prized them before
Chriſt, &amp; refuſed to come to the ſupper. Sudden flaſhes there were in thſoe

but they will quickly vaniſh. We muſt chooſe Chriſt out of judgment.</p>
               <p>Againe, Not chooſe him out of miſtakes, we muſt underſtand who hee
is. we muſt ſit downe and caſt with our ſelves afore-hand what we are like
to ſuffer in his wayes. Compare for this <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 9. with the beginning of
<hi>Chap. 6. What is the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> loved,</hi> ſay they, <hi>more then another beloved?</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="452" facs="tcp:42662:230"/>
Let us know what thy beloved is: Then the Church falls a commending her
beloved, and in the beginning of <hi>Chap. 6. Whither is thy beloved gone?
whither is thy beloved turned a ſide? that we may ſeeke him with thee,</hi> that
he may be our beloved too.</p>
               <p>Nor out of by-ends, but out of a right knowledge of the excellencies of
Chriſt, having our judgments overcome that way. We muſt not chooſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
truth or wayes of God, becauſe the times favour that way; we have now
a company of Parliament converts, who were formerly Prelaticall and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall;
they ſee how the times ſway, this is not out of judgment. Every
Chriſtian ſhould be a judicious Chriſtian. Thoſe adorn Religion, they are
an honour to Chriſt. As the more deliberation and judgement there is in
ſin, the worſe it is; ſo the more deliberation, the more judgment there is in
godlineſſe, the better it is. When a ſoule chooſeth Chriſt and his ways upon
this, Oh I ſee a beauty in the <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> that I never ſee afore, I ſee him to
be the character, and the ingraven form of the image of the Father, in him
dwels all treaſures, the very God-head dwells in him bodily, he is the moſt
precious among ten thouſand, the wayes of God are holy and righteous.</p>
               <p>Here is the rule of eternall life, here lyes the happineſſe of the rationall cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature,
theſe are the wayes that my ſoule cloſeth with, and ſhall cleave to for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
whatſoever I ſuffer in them, for I ſee the excellency, the beauty, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
the glory of them, the <hi>Lord</hi> is worthy of all honour from all his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
This is a choiſe will hold. The world thinks the Saints are giddy hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
people, why? becauſe they cannot ſee any reaſon for what they doe;
they cannot ſee bottome enough in reaſon of ſuch forwardneſſe, and ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and zeale as there is in them; they think they do <hi>in caleſcere in re fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gida,</hi>
that they are very hot about a very poore, ſorry, cold buſineſſe, and
therefore they count their ways folly; that any man will do, when he ſeeth
another do a thing that he underſtands not the reaſon of, hee will either ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
his owne judgment, or otherwiſe think the man fooliſh; now wicked
men are too proud to ſuſpect their own judgments, to think their own reaſon
folly, therefore they count the wayes of God fooliſhneſſe. They looke
upon Gods wayes at a diſtance, therefore they thinke there is no reaſon for
them.</p>
               <p>It is reported of that notable Convert <hi>Marcus Galeaſius,</hi> that hee was
converted by a ſermon of <hi>Peter Martyrs,</hi> coming to heare him he expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the excellencies of Gods wayes, and the miſtakes of the world in this ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude,
the men of the world (ſaith he) miſtake Gods wayes, as if a man
ſee a company of Muſitians that were playing and dancing according to the
moſt exacteſt rules of art, if he ſee them at a diſtance, he ſees them skippiug
and leaping up and down as a company of madde men, and wonders what
they mean; but when he comes nearer and hears the melodious ſound, and
obſerves how all their motions are directed according to rules of art, then he
begins to change his thoughts; ſo the men of the world look upon the wayes
of God, and upon the Saints at a diſtance, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> thinke the motions of
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:42662:230"/>
Gods people and their ways are madneſs, but when they come nearer, and
obſerve the exactneſſe of the rule they walk by, and the wiſedome of God
that appears in them, they change their judgments, and begin then to thinke,
ſurely there is ſomething in them more then they thought. This ſimilitude
God bleſſed, ſo as it was the means to convert that Noble man, and made
him leave all his poſſeſſions in <hi>Italie,</hi> and come to <hi>Geneva,</hi> where hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
ſuch a pattern of ſelf-deny all, as ſcarce any age ever had the like, God
working by ſuch a thing upon his heart. When you come neer Gods ways
and ſee them indeed, you will ſee infinite reaſon in them, and charge your
ſelves o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> infinite folly that you ſhould have ſuch low thoughts of them as
you have had.</p>
               <p>This is the reaſon why the Saints hold on in their ways. This judgment is
as the ballaſt of the ſhip; many hurry on in a kind of profeſſion of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the truth is, they know not what they do, nor what they profeſſe, if
there be any new opinion, I mean not only in regard of new manifeſtation,
but in regard of the thing it ſelfe, preſently they follow it that they may be
counted ſome body, and ſeem to go beyond other men, they are as a ſhip
that moveth a mighty pace, all the ſails are up, and winds blow fairely, but
there is no ballaſt, ſo the ſhip topples up and downe, but never comes to the
end of the voyage. <hi>Lu.</hi> 8. 6. when <hi>the ſeed</hi> was ſown in the <hi>ſtony ground,</hi> it
<hi>ſprung up preſently,</hi> but becauſe there wanted moiſture at the root, it <hi>withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

<hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 21. we read of the ſtony ground, that notwithſtanding it <hi>received
the word with joy,</hi> yet when <hi>perſecution aroſe becauſe of the word,</hi> by and
by they were <hi>offended,</hi> they were mightily taken with the wayes of God,
with the great things of the Goſpel at firſt, but not having judgment as ſoon
as ſuffering came, by and by they were offended. If times ſhould change
again, &amp; the adverſaries ſhould prevaile (which God forbid) we ſhal ſoon
have experience enough of abundance of profeſſors who have choſen the
ways of God not out of judgment by and by they will be offended.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>I will betroth thee unto me in loving kindneſſe.</hi> Though Chriſt
takes us to himſelf, and will not caſt us off, yet he may ſee ſuch failings and
frailties in us, as we may be grievous and burthenſome unto his ſpirit, we

<pb n="454" facs="tcp:42662:231"/>
is the Scripture of the <hi>loving kindneſs</hi> of God towards us in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>To open it a little, The kindneſſe of God unto us in Chriſt, conſiſteth.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In the freeneſſe of Gods goodneſſe: kindneſſe in a friend is ſeene
much in this,<note place="margin">Wherein Gods kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to us in Chriſt appeares.</note> when he doth a thing meerely out of his good nature freely,
when he doth a kindneſſe ſo as he doth not burthen it, he doth not upbraid
his friend with what he hath done; as he expects little before, he will not be
mercenary, ſo when he hath done he doth not upbraid him with it, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects
not ſuch great matters in lieu and recompence of what he hath done,
as ſhall make his kindneſs worth nothing, but leaves it to his friend to anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
him in a way of kindneſs again as he thinks fit.</p>
               <p>Thus it is in all Gods dealings with us, he looks not for much at our hands
before, but that he doth is out of his free grace, he doth not upbraid us, <hi>he
giveth liberally and upbraideth no man,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iam. 1. 5</note> he doth not burthen his kindneſſe
towards us. But doth not God burthen his kindneſſe? he requireth that we
ſhould give up our ſelves unto him, and ſerve him, and ſuffer for him, for
his kindneſs; I anſwer, there is nothing God requireth in lieu of all his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to us, but it is another kindneſs in God to enable us to do it, and a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
kindneſs in him to accept it at our hands when we have done it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his kindneſs is free. The Heathens were wont to paint their <hi>Gratiae,</hi>
their goddeſſes of kindneſs naked, upon this ground, becauſe all workes of
kindneſſe ſhould be free, not clogged, not burthened, <hi>The blesſing of the
Lord maketh rich,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pro. 10. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>and he addeth no ſorrow with it.</hi> The kindneſſes of this
world are ordinarily clogged, ſcarce worth the having; the kindn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſs of God
not ſo, it is free.</p>
               <p>Again, kindneſs conſiſts much in this, in our tenderneſs over thoſe wee
ſhew kindneſſe to. The kindneſs of God in Chriſt is much this way, in
tendring our weakneſſe and dealing with us in all his wayes accordingly, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay,</hi>
57. 16. <hi>I will not contend for ever,</hi> why? <hi>leſt the ſpirit which I have
made ſhould faile before me.</hi> He conſidereth our weakneſs. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. 13.
<hi>The Lord knoweth our frame, and heremembreth we are but duſt,</hi> Iſa. 40.
11. <hi>Chriſt gathers the Lambes with his arme, and carryeth them in his
boſome, and gently leadeth thoſe that are with young. Eſay, 63. 9. In his
clememcie</hi> (ſo the word is) <hi>he redeemed them, and he bare them, and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them alwayes, continually.</hi> Kindnes makes one long-ſuffering, he bare
them always and continually. It is kindneſs for the Man to conſider all the
weakneſſes of the wife, and to deale with her in a loving way accordingly,
tendring her good; this is the kindneſs of Chriſt to his Church,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, kindneſs is paſſing by all infirmities, not taking advantages a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
his people becauſe of them. Chriſt takes notice of all the good that
is in his people though it be never ſo little, but that which is a weakneſſe he
will paſſe it by; <hi>The Lord is not ſtrict to marke what we doe amiſſe,</hi> but the
Lord is ſtrict to mark what we do well, if there be never ſo little good in an
action that hath an hundred weakneſſes in it, Chriſt will mark what good
there is in it, and paſſe by all the weakneſſes. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

for calling her husband <hi>Lord,</hi> in that ſpeech of hers there was nothing but
ſin ſaving that word, and the holy Ghoſt takes notice of that one word and
lets goe all the other. If thou aymeſt at ſerving Chriſt, and canſt appeale to

               <p>Again, kindnes is in a loving, ſweet, amiable carriage toward one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
in our converſe one with another. Oh the ſweet, amiable carriage that
is in Chriſt toward his people! and that Chriſt expects likewiſe from them
to him again. If you reade the book of the <hi>Canticles</hi> you ſhall finde what
ſweet, amiable expreſſions there are between Chriſt and his Church,<note place="margin">

                  </note> what
rebounding as it were there is of love and kindneſſe one to another, <hi>Thy love

then wine,</hi> ſaith Chriſt unto his Church, This ought to be between man &amp;
wife, this is kindneſs, 1 <hi>Cor. 13. 4. Love</hi> is there ſaid to be <hi>kinde,</hi> there is no
moroſity in love, but all a ſweetneſſe.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, kindneſs is in eaſineſs to be entreated, <hi>Jam. 3. 17. Peaceable,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
gentle, and eaſie to be intreated.</hi> Thus in Chriſt, he is eaſie to be intreated
by his Church, and the Church ſhould eaſily be intreated, and indeed is:
when the hearts of the Saints are right, there is an ingenuity in them, they are
ſoone moved to any ſervice Chriſt calleth for.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, kindneſſe is compaſſionate, ſenſible of all ſufferings, ſo Chriſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
and his Saints mutually. Such loving kindnes as this ſhould be in all mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age-communion;
where there is this loving kindneſs there is a ſweet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugall
communion indeed, and ſo far as any of this is wanting, ſo farre the
blesſing of a maryage eſtate is wanting; one reaſon amongſt others, why
God makes ſo much uſe of this Allegory of marryage, to expreſſe ſo great a
myſtery of godlineſs, as the union betweene Chriſt and his Church, is to
teach thoſe that are married to live ſo together, as they may expreſs all that
excellency of communion that is between Chriſt and his Saints.</p>
               <p>Now I put it to you who are in a marryed condition, is there this loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindnes
in you, as may hold forth the loving kindnes that is between Chriſt
and his Spouſe? ſo far as you want in your endeavours after this, ſo far there
is an evil; when you goe home take this leſſon with you, labour to walke ſo
in that way of loving kindnes one to another, as that you may expreſſe how
the loving kindneſs of Chriſt is unto your ſoules.<note place="margin">Kindneſſe betweene man and wife.</note> There are many frailties in
the man, in the wife, but not ſo many frailties as there are in you in reference
to Chriſt, Chriſt beareth with more frailties in you then you can beare with
in your wife; Chriſt is not moroſe to you, he is not a bitter husband to you.</p>
               <p>I have read of <hi>Monicha, Auſtins</hi> Mother, who lived neare a Heathen,
and ſhe had a very ill husband, of a very croſſe and perverſe diſpoſition;
this Heathen comes to her one time, and asked her, how cometh it to paſſe
that you and your husband live ſo well together as you doe?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="456" facs="tcp:42662:232"/>
We know your husband is of a very croſſe and perverſe diſpoſition, yet
we ſee nothing but there is a great deale of ſweetneſs and love between you;
it is not ſo with us, we cannot doe ſo for our lives: <hi>Monicha</hi> gives her this
anſwer, It may be, ſaith ſhe, when your husband is untoward &amp; perverſe,
you are perverſe again, and you give croſſe anſwers; but Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
teacheth me otherwiſe, when my husband cometh home and is in pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
Chriſtian Religion teacheth me to be as loving, and dutifull, &amp; amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to him as I can, and ſo I have gained the heart of my husband. It were
a happy thing if all women would take this home with them, and learne this
of <hi>Monicha Auſtins</hi> Mother, And ſo on the other ſide, the man in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to his wife, this loving kindneſs is between Chriſt &amp; his Spouſe, let
it appeare between man &amp; wiſe who profeſſe their intereſt in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And this loving kindneſs of Chriſt, Oh how ſhould it draw our hearts
unto him! What more prevalent meanes to draw then loving kindneſſe?
Marke that Scripture to ſhew the power of loving kidndnes, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 10. 7.
<hi>If thou be kinde unto this people, they will be thy ſervants for ever,</hi> ſay
thoſe ancient Counſellors of <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> who gave him wiſe counſell. If
this be the way to draw the heart, ſurely Chriſt muſt need have our hearts,
he is not a bloody husband, but a kind husband to us, let us then be his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
for ever. It were a good leſſon for all Governors to conſider of, that
it is kindneſs that drawes the hearts of people, they rule not over beaſts, but
men, therefore if they would rule over them with comfort and ſafety to
themſelves, they ſhould rule with kindneſs. Hence <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. 10. it is ſaid,
that <hi>the Charet of Solomon was paved with love for the daughters of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi>
it is an expreſſion of <hi>Solomons</hi> gentleneſs toward the people of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.
I have read of <hi>Alexander Severus,</hi> when his Mother and his wife
would put him upon harſh wayes, &amp; objected to him his mildneſs &amp; yeild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſſe
to his ſubjects, ſaying, you have made your power more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
by your kindnes &amp; yeelding ſo much to your people; his anſwer
was, <hi>At ſecuriorem,</hi> but more ſecure and laſting. Certainly, it would be ſo
if Magiſtrates had not the evill councell of young Gallants; if they would
follow the counſel of the ancient Counſellors, to be kind to the people, they
would be their ſervants for ever, their peace and ſafety would be more then
now it is. Chriſt expects loving kindneſſe from you unto himſelfe, &amp; lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loving
kindnes likewiſe one unto another.</p>
               <p>Firſt. Chriſt expects you ſhould be full of loving kindnes unto him. O
bleſſed Redeemer, what is that we ſhould do, that we ſhould be kind to the!
The very phraſe ſeems to be too low for Chriſt, that Chriſt ſhould look for
our kindneſſe. Yes, Chriſt lookes for our kindneſſe, and he prizeth it
dearely, nothing in the world is prized by Chriſt more then your kindneſs;
as a kinde husband prizeth nothing in the world more in his wife then kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
But how kind to Chriſt?</p>

Angels and Saints ſay, <hi>Is this your kindneſſe to your friend?</hi> To come
to Chriſt when you have need of him is not ſo much kindneſs, but to come
to him when he hath need of you, this is kindneſſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is kindnes when we ſerve Chriſt in the midſt of difficulties.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
You have a notable place for this, <hi>Jer. 2. 2. I remember the kindneſſe of
thy youth, the love of thine eſpouſals, when thou wenteſt after me in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe.</hi>
To be willing to follow Chriſt in the wilderneſs, that is kindneſs.
Chriſt doth not account it kindnes for us to ſerve him when we may proſper
in his ſervice, when ſerving of Chriſt may ſtand with our own ends, when
we may keepe our ſhops, our lands and poſſeſſions, when there is no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
at all in his ſervice, what great kindnes is this? but when for love to the
Ordinances, &amp; the truths of Chriſt, you are willing to follow Chriſt even in
the wildernes, this is kindnes &amp; Chriſt will account it ſo; however ſome men
have thought that they have ſhewen great kindneſs unto Chriſt, in that they
have ſtaid &amp; born the brunt; but how have they born it? by yeilding to ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious
vanities, &amp; being ceremoniall and Prelaticall; it will be found that
thoſe who have been willing to follow Chriſt in the wilderneſs, our of love <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
to him, his truth and ordinances, that Chriſt will remember that for kindnes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, For young people to give up their young yeares to Chriſt, that
is kindnes, by way of alluſion at leaſt we may make uſe of that Scripture,
<hi>I remember the kindneſſe of thy youth;</hi> when thy bones are full of marrow,
and when the world ſeekes to draw thy heart after the vanities of it, when
thou mayeſt have thy delights and pleaſures in the fleſh to the full; if then
thou beeſt willing to deny all, and to give up thy ſelfe to Chriſt, this is lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
kindneſſe; one that is old may poſſibly come to heaven upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
but what kindneſs is that for him, who hath nigh worn out all his
dayes and ſtrength in wayes of ſinne, in the pleaſures of the fleſh, and now

noting what an ingredient loving kindneſs is to Saint-ſhip, unto godlineſſe;
therefore it is not enough for Chriſtians to be godly, but they muſt be kinde
one unto another too. 2 <hi>Pet. 1. 3. And to godlineſſe adde brotherly kinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</hi>
You thinke you are godly, but you are of a rugged rough-hewen diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
ſurly, cruell, rigid, ſevere, froward, perverſe, know here is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation
unto you this day from God, if you will approve your ſelves to be
godly, <hi>Adde to your godlineſſe brotherly kindneſſe,</hi> except you adde that,
you can have little comfort in your godlines. It is impoſſible indeed for one
that hath the power of godlineſs, and hath the true comfort and ſweetnes of
it, to be of a rugged and rigid diſpoſition; the reaſon is, becauſe there is that
infinite ſatisfaction as I may ſo ſay, that ſuch a heart hath in God, that there
is nothing that can come from without that can make ſuch a heart bitter,
there is ſo much ſweetnes in that ſatisfaction that it hath in God, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſaith, <hi>A good man is ſatisfied from himſelfe;</hi> that it is not all the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs
from without that can ſowre ſuch a heart.</p>
               <p>It is true indeed if you have a veſſel of honey, a little gall will make all that
bitter, but if you have a veſſel of gall, a little honey will not make that ſweet:
But in grace it is thus, though there be a great deale of bitterneſs in a man or
womans nature, though they be of rugged natures, yet a drop of true ſaving
grace will ſweeten all that gall; and if they be once gracious, a great deale of
gall &amp; bitternes that cometh from without will not imbitter that ſweetnes.</p>
               <p>I beſeech you take notice of this one note, when God hath left men they
grow more paſſionate and froward then they were before; And I verily
beleeve this is one ground of the frowardneſſe, and paſſionateneſs that is in
profeſſors, they have made breaches between God and their ſoules, their
peace between God and them is broken, and nothing then can give them
content. As uſually it is when a man hath been abroad and others have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred
him, when his inward comfort and joy is gone, then every thing an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greth
him, he is pleaſed with nothing, his countenance is lowring, and he
is unto ward to every one, and why? becauſe he hath loſt the ſweetneſſe of
his own ſpirit, and now nothing from without can content him, all ſeems
bitter unto him; but let this man goe abroad and things fall out well, it
may be he gets a good bargaine, hears of excellent good newes; that his
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:42662:233"/>
goods are come home ſafely, hee can now beare a hundred times as much
as before, and you can ſcarce anger him, why? becauſe his heart is filled
with ſweetneſs. So it is here, let a Chriſtian walke cloſe with God, keepe
his peace with him, he will have ſo much ſweetnes in his heart that it is not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
to put him into any paſſion of frowardnes, why? he hath enough within,
perhaps his friend, his wife, his neighbour is croſſe, but his Chriſt is loving;
though there be little comfort in my maryage with one who is ſo peeviſh &amp;
perverſe, yet in my marryage with Chriſt there is ſatisfaction enough. But
when the heart hath made breaches between Chriſt and it ſelf, when it hath
loſt the ſweetneſs in that marryage communion, no marvaile if there be no
ſweetnes in the other maryage communion.</p>
               <p>I will give you a notable example of this, a man who before his breach
with God was of a ſweet diſpoſition, was very milde and loving, but after he
was of a perverſe, and cruell, &amp; froward diſpoſition. The example is <hi>Saul;</hi>
When he was firſt choſen King, how humble was he? hee acknowledges
himſelf to be of <hi>the leaſt of the tribes of Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>the leaſt in his fathers
houſe,</hi> and when ſome rayſed npon him and ſaid, <hi>ſhal this man raigne over
us?</hi> the text ſaith, <hi>he held his peace;</hi> and when others would have had them
killed, no, by no means they muſt not be ſlain, becauſe God had ſhewen
him mercy in a late victory given him. But after <hi>Saul</hi> had fallen from God,
O the rugged, perverſe, cruell diſpoſition of his ſpirit then, even to <hi>Jonathan</hi>
his ſon, a gracious, loving, ſweet natured ſon, then <hi>Thou ſonne of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe,
rebellious woman,</hi> he caſt a jave lin at him to kill him, then the foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore
&amp; five Prieſts in the City of <hi>Nob</hi> muſt be all ſlain in his anger; What
was the bottome of all this? It was the breach between God and his owne
ſpirit. Oh take heed of breaches between God and you, for they will put
you into a perverſe and froward diſpoſition. What doth a man get by the
want of this kindneſs and loving diſpoſition. He troubleth himſelf, <hi>Pro.</hi> 11.
17. <hi>He that is cruell,</hi> of a ſharſh diſpoſition, <hi>troubleth his own fleſh.</hi> I
appeale to you, do you not loſe much of the ſweetneſs of your lives, you that
are in a marryed condition? What comfort have you in your lives when
there is nothing but ſnarling at, and croſſing one another? you trouble your
own houſe, and your own fleſh; whereas if there were loving kindneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
you, it would ſweeten all your comforts, yea all your croſſes. The lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

2 <hi>Cor. 6. 6. Being filled with the holy Ghoſt, and kindneſs,</hi> are put together,
there is much of the holy Ghoſt where there is much kindneſſe. The ſpirit of
Chriſt is a ſpirit of kindneſſe and gentleneſs, and though you may thinke that
your rigidneſs and roughneſſe may argue braveneſſe of ſpirit in you (for it is
ordinary for froward and paſſionate people to thinke they have more brave

               <p>Loving kindneſſe and mercies may ſeem in the reading as if they were the

thou ſhalt have the fountain of all good, my very bowels, from whence
flowes all mercies. Wherefore Chriſtians you need not fear the want of the
ſupply of mercies, why? becauſe you have the fountaine of mercies from
whence they ſpring. God may grant to wicked men many fruits of his
bounty and goodneſſe; yea but they have not his bowels, they have not the
fountain, the root from whence all ſprings.</p>
               <p>Here is the happineſſe of a Chriſtian, not onely to have much good from
God,<note place="margin">The reaſon why the Saints can ſo eaſily give up any comfort they have.</note> but to have thoſe very bowels from whence that good cometh. Here
lies the dignity, the glory of a Chriſtian, the vaſtneſſe of his riches.</p>
               <p>Chriſtians, you ſhall not therefore neede feare to give up any mercy God
calls for at your hands, for you have got the bowels of mercy to be yours, you
have got the ſpring-head of all mercy to bee yours, whence you may fetch
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:42662:234"/>
all ſeaſonable, all ſutable mercies when you will. Here is the reaſon why
many who are carnall, when they have got a mercy from God, they keepe
it ſo ſure, they are afraid to loſe it, they are loth to part with it, though God
calleth for it againe. Why? becauſe they are not acquainted with the true
priviledg of a Chriſtian, they do not know what it is to poſſeſſe the bowels
of God, they know not where to goe for more, therefore they are loth to
part with what they have. Now the Saints can part with any thing for God,
let him take what he will have, let him ſtrip me as naked as hee pleaſeth, I
have the bowels of God, I have the ſpring-head to goe to for all mercies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.
It is true, if there were want of water, and you had only water in a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern,
if your neighbour came to borrow of you, you would be loth to lend
any; but if you have a well-ſpring, and a fountaine that never was dry, and
never will be drawn dry, is it a great matter for you to lend water then? So,
it is true, the men of the world are needy creatures, they have ſomething in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
but it is as water in a ciſtern, when that is gone, they think that all is
gone, therefore they will not lend it, no not unto God himſelfe when hee
calls for it. But the Saints have the bowels of mercy, the ſpring-head of all
mercy, therefore whatſoever God calls for, they preſently ſay, Lord here
take all, I know where to have it againe, and much more then that. This
makes godly men ſo ingenuous for God, and ſo free hearted to him and to
his ſervants.</p>

               <p>Yea further, know that it is ſuch mercy as it is the great deſigne, yea the
greateſt deſigne that ever God had from all eternity to honour this his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
to ſet out the infinite glory and the riches of this his mercy in Chriſt.
Certainly God had great deſigns in doing ſuch great things as he hath done,
but above all the deſigns that ever God had in all his works, that is the chief,
to glorifie the riches of his mercy in Chriſt. They are indeed bowels of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,

they are ſuch mercies as are worth all the blood of Chriſt, and his blood

               <p>What ſhall I ſay more in naming any fruits of theſe mercies? Such mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
as whereas before ſin made thee to be the object of Gods hatred, it
makes thee now to be an object of his pity, God takes the riſe from thy ſin
to ſhew his mercy. Take heed of abuſing it, it is childrens bread, that which
I now ſpeak, let us not ſinne that grace may abound, God ſorbid; ſeeing thy
ſin cannot overcome Gods goodneſſe, let Gods goodneſs overcome thy ſin;
Only let us learn to admire at theſe riches of mercy in Chriſt, and let us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
much faith about them. Certainely wee ſhould thrive in godlineſſe
much more if we did exerciſe faith in the bowels of God in Chriſt. Thoſe
kind of fruits, as your Apricocks and your May-cherries, that grow up by a
wall in the open ſun-ſhine, and have the hot reflection of the ſun, come to be
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:42662:240"/>
ſooner ripe &amp; have more ſweetneſs then thoſe that grow in ſhady places;
your graſſe you know that is ſhaded by the trees, in Orchards, is ſowre; So
that fruit that Chriſtians bring forth under diſcouragements and diſpairing
thoughts, is very ſowre; ſome things they do conſcience hales them to du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
but alas it is ſowre fruit; though it be better to doe what conſcience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
then not, for we muſt not go againſt conſcience, but to doe it meerly
becauſe conſcience hales to it, it is but ſowre graſſe. But when a Chriſtian
can by Faith ſet himſelfe before the Sun-ſhine of theſe mercies of God in
Chriſt, and continually live in the midſt of the luſtre of the grace of God in
Chriſt, he groweth ripe ſooner, and his fruit is ſweeter. You may know
whether it be the Sun of righteouſneſſe or no that you are ſet in, Doth your
fruit grow ripe? and is it ſweet fruit? Thoſe who talke of mercy and of
Chriſt, who have the name of Chriſt in their mouths, but is their fruit ſowr,
does nothing come from them but crabbed fruit? theſe men are not in the
Sun, they are blinde, they cannot ſee the Sun, they are but in a light of their
own fancy, and in a heat of their own making.</p>

your bowels rotten, to have diſeaſes in your bowels, know it is as great an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
to have your hearts unmercifull, that is, to have a diſeaſe in your bowels,
ſo the Scripture phraſe is, <hi>Amos 1. 11. He caſt off all pitie, &amp; his anger did
tear perpetually,</hi> ſo it is in your bookes; but the words in the Originall are,
<hi>And corrupted his bowels;</hi> their bowels were corrupted when they were not
pittiful toward their brethren in miſery. It was a grievous condition that <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horam</hi>
was in, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21. 15. when his bowels came forth by reaſon of his
diſeaſe. An unmercifull heart is a worſe diſeaſe then this.</p>
               <p>What are wee, and who are we that Gods mercies ſhould be ſhewen to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
us? why not our mercies toward our brethren then? The Scripture
calleth exceedingly for mercy in the Saints toward one another. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 17.
<hi>Put on as the Elect of God bowels of mercy and kindneſs.</hi> VVould you have
an argument unto your ſelves that you are Gods Elect? put on bowels then.
Never was there time ſince you lived, or your forefathers lived, wherein
God called for bowels more then now. Do you hear of the miſeries of your
brethren, their goods ſpoiled, houſes burnt, wives, children raviſhed, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
impriſoned, their bodies wounded, and yet no bowels all this while;
what, you hard-hearted in the meane time? Are you the elect of God? why
I pray you, what is your fleſh more then the fleſh of others? what are your
comforts more then the comforts of others? why ſhould you lie ſoft and ſafe
more then others? Is there any ſuch difference betwixt you and your bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
that they ſhould be in miſery, and you muſt be pampered, and ſcarce
feele the very wind to blow on you, and yet in the meane time your hearts
hardned towards them? It is true, God it is that hath made the difference
you will ſay; and God may make a difference where he pleaſeth. I grant it,
and it would not grieve God to make ſuch a difference betweene you and
them, if he ſaw your bowels yern towards them. But if God layes ſuch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
upon your brethren who are better then you, and have done more
for him then ever you have done, and yet you are hard-hearted, this will
grieve God at the heart. 1 <hi>Ioh. 3. 17. He that ſeeth his brother hath need,
and ſhuiteth up his bowels of compaſſion from him, how dwelleth the love of
God in him?</hi> If thou haſt bowels, and ſhutteſt them up from thy brother,
ſurely thou never kneweſt what the love of God meant.</p>
               <p>Mark that place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 8. what encouraging expreſſions we have unto
bounty and liberality toward our brethren, for the opening our bowels to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
them. <hi>God is able to make all grace abound towards you, that yee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
having all ſufficiency in all things, may abound to every good worke.</hi>
There is no ſuch text in all the book of God to encourage to the opening our
bowels to the adminiſtring to the neceſſities of the Saints, for that Scripture
is brought to that end, that part of the Chapter is ſpent about that argument,
if you believe any thing in the Scripture, if you have any experience of Gods
bowels towards you, read over this, and ſee if it will not open your bowels.</p>

what he had he gave away, becauſe he had a ſpirit that looked after and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
for great things to come; certainly Chriſtians have that left, alwayes
they have hope, they may expect great things, why? becauſe they have the
bowels of Gods mercies to be theirs.</p>
               <p>One thing more (to knit all together) all righteouſneſſe, all judgement,
all loving kindneſſe, all mercies comes from God through our union with
Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Though God be an infinite ocean of goodneſſe, yet we can expect nothing
from God but through our union with Chriſt, Man hath forfeited the title
he had to all the goodneſs of God, and now the title upon which he is to hold
all his good, it is the union he hath with this husband, with JESUS
CHRIST by vertue of this marryage. Whenſoever Faith goes to heaven
for any good from God, it goeth to heaven by vertue of this right, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
all the good it gets from God by vertue of that conjugall union the
ſoul hath with JESUS CHRIST.</p>
               <p>How bleſſed then was the time when Chriſt was firſt revealed to the
Church! <hi>Cant. 3. 11. Behold King Solomon with the Crown where with
his mother crowned in the day of his eſpouſals, in the day of the gladneſſe of
his heart,</hi> Theſe things opened in our eſpouſals with Chriſt, muſt needes
make that day the day of the gladnes of our hearts. O how deare ſhould this
Chriſt thy husband be unto thee! how happy, when thou ſhalt have full
communion with him! when <hi>Jſaac</hi> met <hi>Rebekka,</hi> he carryed her into his
mothers tent: when the Lord Chriſt ſhall meet his ſpouſe, he will carry her
into his Fathers pillace. Behold the riches, the glory of my Father whom I
told you of, theſe are all yours in my right eternally.</p>

               <p>Here is a third betrothing, <hi>I will betroth, I will betroth,
I will betroth, Jerome</hi> hath a note upon that and ſaith,
that it is thrice repeated to note three ſeveral times of Gods
betrothing himſelfe unto his people. 1. VVhen he called
<hi>Abraham.</hi> 2. After they went out of Egypt and were in
the wilderneſſe at Mount Sinai. 3. In the time of the Goſpell. And of this
Expoſition <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Argutum ſed ſrivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum.</note> it may be accounted witty, but it is frivolous. He
giveth a better reaſon (which I thinke to be the minde of the holy Ghoſt)
why it is thrice tepeated; Becauſe apoſtatizing Iſrael could hardly beleeve
that ever God would doe ſuch a thing as this, what after the Lord had caſt
Iſrael away? yea caſt her to the beaſts (for ſo he threatneth in the former
part of the chapter) yet now betroth her to himſelf, this was unlikely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I will</hi> [<hi>even</hi>] <hi>betroth thee,</hi> ſo you have it in your books; now the truth is,
the word in the Originall is <hi>Vau,</hi> the ſame that is tranſlated <hi>and</hi> before, but
becauſe the third time it is ſaid [<hi>and</hi>] the Tranſlators thought there was an
emphaſis in the third <hi>And,</hi> and therefore to expreſſe that emphaſis they put
in the word [<hi>even.</hi>] <hi>Infaithfulneſſe</hi>] In ſteadineſs, ſo the word ſignifieth,
I will betroth thee unto me in a ſteady way,<note place="margin">Infide, in conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a, in ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitate.</note> my goodneſs toward thee ſhall
be ſtable and ſirme. So the word is often uſed in Scripture, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17. 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His hands were ſteady,</hi> the ſame word that we have here for faithfulnes,
So <hi>Deut. 28. 59. I will make thy plagues of long continuanoe,</hi> thy plagues
ſtable and conſtant, the ſame that is here for faithfulneſs. And 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 35.
<hi>I will raiſe me up a faithfull Prieſt, and I will build him a ſure houſe,</hi> there
the word is of the ſame roote, a ſure houſe, a firm, ſteady houſe. Faithfulnes
here imports, Gods ſtability &amp; ſteadines in his Covenant with his people.
It notes not ſo much the perpetuity, for that was before, <hi>I will betroth thee
unto me for ever:</hi> But firmeneſs &amp; conſtancy, as oppoſite to ficklenes &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty.
There is much unconſtancy &amp; fickleneſs in our love one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but the love of God to his people is ſtable, ſetled, firm &amp; conſtant love.</p>
               <p>That is the meaning in the firſt place, though not all. <hi>Eſay 62. 5. As the
Eridegroome rejoyceth over the Bride, ſo ſhal thy God rejoyce <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="468" facs="tcp:42662:243"/>
is, the love of Chriſt after thouſands of yeers is ſtill but as the love of a bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome
upon the wedding day, then ordnarily love is hot &amp; appears much;
not the love onely of the husband,<note place="margin">Chriſts love is ſteady, and why. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> but as the Bridegroome.</p>
               <p>There is no moment of time, but Chriſt rejoyceth not onely as a hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
but as a Bridegroome over every gracious ſoule.</p>
               <p>Chriſts love is ſteady, becauſe it is pure, without mixture; it is a holy
love. Obſerve the comparing of two Texts, <hi>Eſay 55. 3. The ſure mercies
of David</hi> are promiſed there. In <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 34. that Scripture is quoted,
and there it is <hi>The holy things of David;</hi> As noting, becauſe the love of
God is holy, therefore it is ſure and ſtedfaſt.</p>
               <p>Chriſts love unto his people is in <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> as before, and in <hi>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and in <hi>loving kindneſſe,</hi> and <hi>mercies:</hi> It is from the ſweetneſs of his
nature, and therefore it is ſteady &amp; firm. <hi>With him there is no ſhadow of
change.</hi> It is grounded upon a ſure covenant, therefore firme. Though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the love of Chriſt may be to us as the ſhining of the Sun, not alwayes in
the fruits of it, ſhining out ſo gloriouſly, but the Sun keepes his courſe in a
ſteady way, though ſometimes it is clouded, and we have it not ſo gloriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as at other times. The Saints ſhould faſten upon the love of Chriſt in the
Covenant; and though other things be never ſo uncertaine, yet they ſhould
quiet their hearts in this, that their happineſs in the Covenant of grace is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.
Perhaps the love of our friend is uncertaine, very fickle and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant;
thoſe who will glavor upon you, and ſeeme as if their hearts were
with you, but what ſullen moods and fits will there be at times! and when
you have moſt need of them, you know not where to finde them. But the
love of Chriſt is certaine and ſtable, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 5. Marke how <hi>David</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted
himſelf in the ſtableneſſe of the love of God in the covenant. <hi>Though
he doth not cauſe my houſe to grow, yet he hath made with me an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
covenant, ordered in all things and ſure, and this is all my deſire &amp; all
my hope,</hi> that is, that the Covenant is ſure and ſtedfaſt.</p>
               <p>And (as we have opened it in all the former) ſo here it muſt be mutuall.<note place="margin">The Saints love to Chriſt ſteady.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I will betroth thee in faithfulneſſe,</hi> and make thee faithfull too; that is,
thou ſhalt have a ſteady, firme, ſtable ſpirit in thy love to me, though not
in that degree that Chriſts is, yet there is a ſtability in the hearts of the Saints
unto Chriſt, they are not carried up and down with every wind of doctrine,
with every puffe of temptation as other men are. <hi>The righteous is an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
foundation,</hi> Pro. 10. 25. <hi>The upright holdeth on his way,</hi> Iob. 17. 9.</p>
               <p>It muſt needs be ſo, becauſe the affections of the Saints unto Chriſt are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affections too, though not perfect, they have indeed ſome mixture, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſome inſtability; but they have holineſs, therefore ſtability.</p>
               <p>And they chooſe Chriſt in righteouſneſſe and in judgement. And they
have the Divine Nature in them; and as that hath no ſhadow of change, ſo
they come to have ſomething like to the immutability of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
ſome ſhadow of it. <hi>Eſay</hi> 26. 3. A godly man is deſcribed thus, <hi>Whoſe
minde is ſtaid upon God:</hi> he hath a ſtable ſpirit, not a wandring, fickle, ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:42662:243"/>
ſpirit, he hath fixed himſelf upon God, he can ſay, <hi>My heart is fixed.</hi>
The men of the world, becauſe they have not that which can ſatisfie, run up
and downe, firſt, after one contentment, then after another, they have no
where to fix: but the Saints finde all-ſufficiency in God, when they are
there, their hearts are ſatisfied, and there they fix. As a Bee lighting upon a
flower,<note place="margin">The evil of a fickle un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant ſpirit.</note> finding but a little honey, gets away to another, and to another, and
to another; but when it comes to a flower, where it may ſuck honey enough
it fixeth, it ſtayeth there. The hearts of the Saints find a fulneſſe of good, in
God, and there they fixe. A fickle, wavering, unſtable ſpirit is exceeding
unbeſeeming a Chriſtian. As it is in the body, ſome who have fluſhings of
heat, have a very good colour for a while, but when we know this good co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
is but a fluſh, it is rather an argument of a diſeaſe, then of a good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion.
An end of a candle that burnes in the ſocket gives ſome flaſhes of
light now and then, but a candle that is ſet upon a table gives a ſteady and
conſtant light. Mad people you know have their <hi>Iudicia intervalla,</hi> ſome
times wherein they doe acts of reaſon, but you may perceive they are not in
their wits, becauſe there is not conſtancy, and evenneſſe in their actions.</p>
               <p>This ſtablenes, this evenes in a Chriſtian way is the beauty and glory of it.
Though you be never ſo forward ſometimes in that which is good, yet if at
other times your hearts be off, there is no beauty in your converſation. But
give me a Chriſtian whoſe wayes are even, that you may finde a conſtancy
in him in all his wayes.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who have ſuch fickle, uncertaine, inconſtant hearts, are never like
to excell; if they have any truth in them, yet they will never be eminent
Chriſtians, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 4. it is ſaid of <hi>Ruben, Ruben unſtable as water, but hee
ſhall not excell;</hi> ſo it may be ſaid of a Chriſtian unſtable; here is one of
good affections, at ſometimes very forward, but unſtable as water, he ſhall
not excell. Conſtancy in love is exceeding comely and beautifull between
man and wife, from thence is the expreſſion of the holy Ghoſt here; it adds
much unto the luſtre and comfort of their lives. For men to ſeeme ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to be mighty fond, &amp; other times to be bitter and ſowre, like <hi>Nabals;</hi>
or the wife to be very fond ſometimes, and to be grievous &amp; irkeſome at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
times, this takes away the beauty, the comfort of their lives.</p>
               <p>But there is more in this <hi>faithfulneſſe</hi> then ſtability and firmeneſs, <hi>I will
betroth thee in faithfulneſſe;</hi> I will certainly performe all the good you can
expect from me, which is befitting a husband, yea ſuch a husband as I am,
to doe to my Spouſe;<note place="margin">Providen tiam crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turis non negamus, curam ſibi ſponſa vendicat. <hi>Bern.</hi>
                  </note> you may confide in me, I will be faithfull to you, not
onely my love, but my faithfulnes ſhall binde me to you: My loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
my mercifull diſpoſition is a great bond, but my faithfulnes ſhall binde
me alſo, I will be content to ingage my ſelfe to you, that you may certainly
confide in me, ſo as you may not only expect it from my love, but challenge
it from my faithfulneſs. We deny not Gods providence to other creatures,
but the Spouſe challengeth Gods care, ſaith <hi>Bernard,</hi> which is beyond pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
ſuch as is out of faithfulnes, as well as out of love. Chriſt here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcends
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:42662:244"/>
to his Spouſe, as a man is willing to give ſatisfaction to his wife &amp;
her friends, though the truth is he would doe any thing in the world out of
love to his wife, yet in regard of her weakneſſe, and to ſatisfie ſome friends
he is content to enter into bond, to do any thing that is fitting; it is good to
make all things ſure before-hand, ſay her friends, he preſently yeilds, for it
is no other but what he is willing to doe without bonds, onely to ſatisfie her
and their minds. Thus it is between Chriſt and his Spouſe: The truth is, the
love of Chriſt is enough to make a ſupply of any of our wants, but wee are
weake, and would faine have things made ſure, therefore ſaith Chriſt to
helpe our weakeneſs, I will even enter into bond, and you may be ſure I
will be faithfull then, I will binde my faithfulnes to you for all the good you
would have.</p>
               <p>And this faithfulneſſe of Chriſt is either in regard of the great Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age-Covenant,
there hee will be ſure to be faithfull to his Spouſe; Or in
regard of all particular promiſes, that are under things as it were. There is
the great marriage-covenant, about reconciling God, and paying all debts
that are owing and ſatisfying Gods juſtice, and bringing to eternall life; but
there are many under-promiſes, and Chriſt will be faithfull in them all. <hi>Pſ.</hi>
25. 10. you have a promiſe worth a kingdome, <hi>All the paths of the Lord

               <p>God ſtands much upon this that the hearts of his Saints ſhould confide in

do one to another when you would make things ſure betweene you? Wee
anſwer thus, Lord we ingage our ſelves by promiſe one to another. I will do
ſo ſaith Chriſt, you ſhall have my promiſe, my faithfull promiſe. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 39.
<hi>Peter</hi> invites to Baptiſme upon this ground, becauſe <hi>the promiſe is made to

have the promiſe that you have, they come under the ſame Covenant for the

                  </gap>ing aged himſelf in, is no other then a draught of that which
was before the world began, from all eternity, and therefore it is ſo much the
more ſure. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 2. the Goſpell is called <hi>a promiſe before the world began.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All promiſes in the Scripture are but a draught of that grand promiſe that
God the Father made to his Son before the world began; As if Chriſt ſhould
ſay, Will you have engagement by promiſe? This is paſt long agoe, my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath engaged himſelf to me from all eternity, &amp; if you have any promiſe
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:42662:244"/>

made me from all eternity.</p>
               <p>VVhat doe you doe more when you would make things ſure one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
VVe anſwer, we doe not onely make a verball promiſe, by word of
mouth, but we write it. God hath therefore given us his Scripture, and the
chiefe thing in Scripture is the promiſe, God hath ſet to his hand to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
in Scripture. Hence <hi>Luther</hi> hath a notable expreſſion, The whole
Scripture doth eſpecially aim at this, that we ſhould not doubt, but believe,
confide, hope that God is mercifull, kind, patient.</p>
               <p>VVhat do you more? Here you have my promiſe and my hand, is there
any thing elſe you uſe to do, to make things ſure? VVe anſwer, Lord wee
take witneſſes. I will do ſo too, ſaith God. VVhen we would make things
ſure indeed, we take not only two, but three, or four, but half a dozen wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes

               </p>
               <p>What do you more to make a thing ſure? Lord, we ſet to our ſeales too;
you ſhall have that too ſaith God, you ſhall have ſeals of all ſorts, you ſhall
have the broad ſeale of Heaven, the Sacraments, the ſeals of the Covenant;
and you ſhall have my privie ſeale, I will take my Ring off my finger, I will
give you even the ſeale of the ſpirit, and do but ſhew this ſeale, it is authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call

               <p>Is there any thing more? Yes we anſwer, there is one thing more, we take
an oath, I will do that too, ſaith God, that you may be ſure, and confide in
my faithfulneſſe. <hi>Heb. 6. 17. God willing more abundantly to ſhew unto the
heirs of promiſe the immutability of his councell, conſirmed it by his oath.</hi>
As if he ſhould ſay, there is no ſuch need of an oath, but I will be abundant
to you, becauſe I would have you truſt mee, And mark this is for the ſake
of the heirs of promiſe, God would never have done this for other men, it is
for your ſakes onely who are the heirs of promiſe, in regard of your weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
he conrfims all with an oath. And if wee would have things ſure, wee
will not have the oath of ſuch as are of no great credit. Mark, therefore it
is that God ſweareth, and that by the greateſt oath, <hi>ver. 13. Becauſe he
could ſweare by no greater,</hi> ſaith the text, <hi>he ſware by himſelfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is there any thing more ſaith God that you uſe to do among your ſelves
to make things ſure? Yes Lord, we uſe to take a pawn too. You ſhall have
that too ſaith he, I will give you a pawn, and ſuch a pawn as if you never had
any thing more you would be happie. what is that? 2 <hi>Cor. 1. 22. Who hath
ſealed us, and given us the earneſt of his ſpirit in our hearts.</hi> I will ſend my
ſpirit to be an earneſt of all the good that I intend to do for you everlaſtingly.
Is there any thing elſe you would require of me that you may confide in me?
Yes, if God would doe ſome great &amp; notable work as a beginning &amp; as an
ingagement of that which is to come after, this is yet more then
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:42662:245"/>
a pawne, when there is ſome ſpeciall thing done in way to that which wee
make account of, that we are not only promiſed it, and have it under hand
and ſeale, and have an oath and a pawne, but it is in a great degree begun,
and ſo begun as the difficulty is over. Thoſe who live under the Goſpell ſee
the greateſt part of our ſalvation already done for us. God made a promiſe
of ſending his Son into the world; Now in Gods performing that promiſe
that God-man ſhould come into the world to be made a curſe for ſin, this is
the greateſt worke of all that is to be done to all eternity, and if God would
have failed in any thing it would have been in that. It is not ſo much for
God to deliver us in this world, it is not ſo much for him to bring us to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
as it is to ſend his Son into the world to be made a curſe for us. Now
when God hath done ſo great a work and hath beene faithfull in that great
promiſe, he hath taught us for ever to truſt in him, to beleeve his faithfulneſs
in making good other promiſes. If a man who owes five thouſand pound,
and payes you foure thouſand nine hundred of it, you thinke ſurely hee will
never breake for one hundred, I may truſt him for the reſt, ſeeing hee hath
dealt ſo faithfully with me in the great ſumme. God hath paid the four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
nine hundred and much more, in compariſon of what God hath done
for us, take all the glory of heaven, we have not one hundred of the five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
left behince, therefore we may well confide in him for the payment of
the reſt.<note place="margin">God a ſure object for our faith.</note> But is God able? It is true, God is faithfull: This is ſeldome an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
at leaſt an explicite objection in the mouths of people, but ſurely an

gives to take away that objection, 1 <hi>Pet. 4. 19. Commit the keeping of your

O Lord that thy judgements are right, and that thou in faithfulneſſe haſt

You muſt give God leave to doe his worke his owne way. The object of
our confidence in God, it is, the thing will be done, it is not how it will be
done, or when it will be done, but that God will carry his worke thorough.
Shall our weakneſs be ſo much regarded, as that things muſt not work ſo as
to ſhew Gods power? Certainly it is too too much for us to think our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
muſt be ſo far condeſcended to. One would think that it is enough, that
God condeſcendeth ſo much as to expreſſe himſelf ſo to you as you may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve;
would you have God condeſcend to expreſſe himſelfe ſo to you, as
he ſhould not have the glory of his worke, nor you the glory of your faith?
this is too low. Though we be bound to deny our ſelves much, becauſe of the
weakneſs of our brethren; Muſt God deny his glory becauſe of our weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe?
We burden God too much with our weakneſſe. It is for Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

When we have a promiſe, let us put on to get the goodneſſe of God to work,
which is by believing. For that I will give you as notable an example as any
I know you have in the book of God, of a believing heart, catching hold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a promiſe upon Gods faithfulneſſe to work it out, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17. 23. and
ſo on. In the former part of the Chapter you ſhall finde God had promiſed
<hi>David</hi> to eſtabliſh his houſe, to build him a ſure houſe; Well, as ſoone as
<hi>David</hi> had got the word, mark how hee improves it, how hee works upon
Gods word; As if he had ſaid, Seeing I have got his word, I will hold to it,
he ſhall not goe from it, ſaith he, <hi>Therefore, O Lord, let the things thou haſt
ſpoken concerning thy ſervant and concerning his houſe, be eſtabliſhed for
ever, and doe as thou haſt ſaid.</hi> Thou haſt ſpoken, do as thou haſt ſaid. <hi>Ver.</hi>
24.<note place="margin">Faith will hold God to his word.</note> 
                  <hi>Let it even be eſtabliſhed,</hi> I expect it, ſeeing thou haſt been pleaſed in
ſuch a gracious way to promiſe me thus, I will relye upon it, <hi>let it be even e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed,
that thy name may be magnifyed for ever.</hi> I will plead thy name
in it, if there be any thing to be pleaded more then other, I will plead it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thee; but is not this enough? <hi>Verſ. 25. Thou O Lord God haſt told thy
ſervant that thou wilt build him an houſe, therefore thy ſervant hath found
in his heart to pray before thee.</hi> He had ſaid before, that God had ſpoken
it; here he goes over it again, as making much of Gods word, thou haſt told
me, and I pray for nothing but what thou haſt told me. Nay yet ſtill <hi>David</hi>
encroacheth more upon God, <hi>Ver. 26. Now O Lord thou art God, &amp; thou
haſt promiſed this goodneſſe unto thy ſervant.</hi> I have not to deal with a man
that will be fickle and inconſtant, wavering and unfaithfull, but thou art
God, and I will truſt in thee as a God, thou art God, and thou haſt promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
this goodneſſe, it is thine owne goodneſſe, now therefore do it. See how
he followeth God upon his promiſe. And mark what admirable effects fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
upon this, <hi>Chap. 18. ver. 1. After this,</hi> ſaith the Text, <hi>he proſpered,</hi>
when his enemies came againſt him, he took a thouſand charets, and ſeven
thouſand horſemen, and twenty thouſand footmen from <hi>Hadarezer,</hi> and
when the Syrians came to help that <hi>Hadarezer,</hi> he ſlew of the Syrians two
and twenty thouſand men. After this, mark the connexion of that Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and this, after <hi>David</hi> had improved the promiſe, hee might have what
he would; thus the loving kindneſſe of God was laid up in a promiſe, but
wrought out by <hi>Davids</hi> faith. This is our evill that we do not improve this
faithfulneſſe of God, wee loſe abundance by it. It is an argument that wee
have baſe ſpirits. It is a great evill between man and wife, when they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
confide one in another, but are jealous, how can ſuch live comfortably
together? So we are jealous of God, we loſe our comfort in him; Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
comes oftentimes from much baſeneſſe of ſpirit, and ſelfe-guiltineſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we are of ſuch baſe hearts our ſelves, that is the reaſon we are ſo jealous
of God. Where there is much love between man and wife, there cannot be
much jealouſie, and if there were intire love in the Spouſe of Chriſt, there
would not be jealouſie. You have an excellent paſſage for that, <hi>John</hi> 5. 40.
<hi>You will not come unto me that you might have life,</hi> you will not believe in
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:42662:246"/>
me, that is the meaning: then <hi>ver. 42. I know you have not the love of God
in you.</hi> Is there any thing in the world more tedious to a Husband, then that
the Wife ſhould be jealous of him?<note place="margin">Evidences that we do not truſt in Gods faith fulneſs.</note> think of it, the ſame tediouſneſſe it is
unto the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, that thou ſhouldſt be jealous of him, and not
confide in his faithfulneſſe.</p>
               <p>Surely if we did truſt in Gods faithfulneſſe, wee would not think to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
with him ſo as we do, but wee would improve his promiſe to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
moſt. As you that are Merchants, and have much owing you, all the
while you confide in your debtors, you will not compound with them for leſs
then your debt; if you ſhould come to one that ows you money, and ſay, I
pray Sir pay in my money, and I ſhall be content to take ten, or fifteen in the
hundred; the party would think himſelfe diſg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>aced; what, do you diſtruſt
me? Do you think I will break? No, I will pay you every penny, he ſtands
upon his credit. The truth is, we poor wretches, becauſe we have not Gods
promiſes preſently fulfilled, we would compound with God, that is, if God
would give us any little comfort for the preſent, we would be ſatisfied rather
then waite for that which is to come, though it be infinitely more; this is a
great diſhonour to God, and an argument of our unfaithfulneſſe. It is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of little faith, if thou canſt be ſatisued, ſhould God give thee tenne
thouſand worlds for the preſent, if God ſhould ſay, what will yon have?
would you have your enemies deſtroyed? would you have your peace and
your trading in the world, your eaſe and quietneſſe? Is this all? This is to
compound with God for twelve pence in the pound as it were. No ſaith a
gracious heart, Lord thou haſt promiſed mercy, &amp; I expect it to the full, I wil
not abate the leaſt farthing of it. God loveth we ſhould ſtand with him for
his promiſe unto the uttermoſt farthing. No, but I hope God give me Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
at laſt, yet I doubt hee will leave mee here in the world. This is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
with God another way; there are ſome who perhaps will pay eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene,
or fifteen ſhillings in the pound, but it is a diſhonour to God to abate
one ſhilling in the pound, therefore we muſt not onely believe in God for
heaven, but for earth, and for ſafety and comfort, and that in times of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
trouble. God is well pleaſed with ſuch kind of holy impudence, as we
may ſay, that is, to follow him for the uttermoſt, and to urge him upon his
word again and again, to pay what he is ingaged for.</p>
               <p>Again, had we faith in God we would ſet upon great things though we ſee
but little meanes. Many of you who have but little ſtockes, yet if you have
rich friends that have given you encouragement, and that you know will be
faithfull to you, you will trade for great things with your little ſtock, becauſe
you know you have thoſe friends will ſtand by you. So though we have but
little ſtrength,<note place="margin">We muſt be faithfull to god, ſo as God may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide in us.</note> if God call us, we ſhould be willing to ſet upon great things,
becauſe God hath ſtock enough, and he hath ingaged himſelf to ſtand by us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I will bearoth thee unto me in faithfulneſs.</hi> As I will be faithfull to you,
and you ſhall conſide in my faithfulneſſe, ſo you ſhall be faithfull to me, that
I may confide in your faithfulneſſe, as I fulfill all my promiſes, &amp; covenant
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:42662:247"/>
vvith you, ſo you ſhall be faithfull to make good all the promiſes and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with me. The Spouſe of Chriſt is ſuch a one as the Spirit of Chriſt can
confide in. It is ſaid of the vertuous woman, <hi>Pro. 31. 11. Her husband
truſteth in her.</hi> Let him be abroad or at home, in what company ſoever, yet
his heart truſteth in her, he can leave all his buſineſſe, his writing, or any
thing that concerns him with ſuch a wife: VVhere there is want of this
truſting of the heart of the husband in the wife, there is want of comfort in
their lives; thus God ſaith of his people, <hi>Eſay 63. 8. They are children that
will not lye;</hi> I can confide in them, I can turne them unto any buſineſſe as I
will, for they are children who will not lye.</p>
               <p>They are faithfull to God firſt in the great Covenant, in the ſurrendring
themſelves to God, as they doe at their firſt cloſing with Chriſt. In the firſt
act of beleeving<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> every gracious ſoul enters into ſolemn covenant with God,
&amp; it will be faithfull in that covenant. And they will be faithfull likewiſe in
all their under promiſes &amp; vowes that they make to God, in days of faſting,
and thanſgiving, and at other times. As Gods promiſes are Gods gifts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us, ſo ſhould our promiſes be as gifts unto God. 2 <hi>Tim. 1. 9. According
to his purpoſe and grace, which was given unto us in Chriſt Ieſus before the
world began;</hi> not onely promiſed, but given unto us in Chriſt Jeſus. Gods
eternall purpoſe is called Gods gift, ſo our purpoſes and our promiſes ought
to be as ſure as gifts unto God.</p>
               <p>So in thy converſation thou muſt be faithfull to Chriſt, not proſtitute thy
ſelfe unto another, but keep thy ſelfe for Chriſt. Indeed the ſpouſe of Chriſt
may be raviſhed by open violence, but ſhe will not proſtitute her ſelf to any
other, ſhe keepes her ſelf onely for Chriſt. Thus the Saints are deſcribed,
<hi>Ephe. 1. 1. faithfull in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> There is a kinde of natural faithfulnes
as I may ſo ſpeak, as in that place <hi>Eſay 8. 2. I took unto me faithfull witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
Calvin</hi> ſaith it is meant of <hi>Vrijah,</hi> that baſe temporizing <hi>Vrijah,</hi> who
made the Altar according to the patterne that <hi>Ahaz</hi> ſent from Damaſcus,
he is ſaid to be faithfull, that is, he was a faire, honeſt dealing man, his word
was as good as his bond; ſo many civill men will be faithfull of their words;
But mark here in the <hi>Epheſians</hi> it is <hi>faithfull in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> it is nnt onely
faithfulneſſe between man and man, for many Heathens were ſo, they would
rather dye then cozen and cheate one another, but this is a higher degree of
faithfulneſs; it is a <hi>faithfulneſſe in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> ſo the Saints muſt be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
faithfull to Chriſt Jeſus, and faithfull in Chriſt Jeſus. They who are
thus faithfull, are fit for the ſervice of Chriſt, Chriſt hath a great deale of
work to do, they are only fit for it, <hi>Rev. 17. 14. The Lamb ſhal overcome,</hi>
why? <hi>for they that are with him, are choſen, and called, and faithfull,</hi> not
called faithfull, but called and faithfull, and therefore the Lambe ſhall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.
It were happy that all that are in this publicke ſervice in the kingdom
that are with the Lambe, with Chriſt in this cauſe, were called and faithfull,
the work would ſoon be at an end; It is faithfulneſs we ſhall be hereafter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

upon the faithfulneſſe of their hearts. And as you muſt be faithfull unto
God and his cauſe, ſo you muſt be faithfull one to another. You who are
ſervants, if you be godly, be ſure you be faithfull to your Maſters, that there
may be no occaſion of any ſuch ſcandoll as often there is concerning thoſe
who are profeſſors, ſuch a ſervant is forward, he muſt goe to ſermons, and
he is ſet againſt ceremonies, &amp;c. But I never had any ſo unfaithfull, if mine
eye be but off him, hee is from his buſineſſe preſently. God forbid there
ſhould be ſuch ſcandols given. So VVives who profeſſe godlineſs, be you
ſure you be faithful to your husbands and tradeſmen who profeſſe more then
ordinary ſtrictneſs in Religion, be you faithfull in your dealings. Hath Chriſt
married himſelfe unto thee in faithfulneſſe? he expects that his faithfulneſſe
to thee ſhould have that reflection upon thy heart as to make thee faithful to
others. There is one note that is to be taken from all together. As if God
ſhould ſay, O Iſrael, you have dealt unrighteouſly with me, you have broken
your covenant, you have gone a whoring from me, but I will betroth you to
me in righteouſneſſe. You have done fooliſhly in departing from me, but
I will betroth you unto me in judgement. You have been unkind to me, but
I will betroth you unto me in loving kindneſs. It hath not pittied your ſouls
to ſee me diſhonored, but I will betroth my ſelfe in bowels of mercy to you.</p>
               <p>You have been unfaithfull to me, but I will even betroth you unto me in
faithfulneſſe. The note from thence is this.</p>
               <p>God dealeth not with thoſe in Covenant with him as they deale with him.<note place="margin">Obſer.</note>
It is a note of admirable uſe and comfort. Marke the difference betweene
Gods dealing with others and thoſe that are in covenant with him. Let o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

them ſo too, <hi>Pſal. 18. 26. With the froward thou wilt ſhew thy ſelfe fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi>
Will you be froward with God? God will ſhew himſelfe froward
with you. Will you be proud with God? In the thing you are proud God wil
be above you. Will you be ſubtil and contriving miſchiefe againſt God
and his truth? God will meet with the wicked, and inſnare them in the
work of their own hands. Are you reſolute in wickedneſſe? God will be as
reſolute as you for your hearts, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 44, 25. 26. But when God comes to
deale with his Saints in covenant, though they deale frowardly with him,
hee will deale gently with them: though they deale proudly with him,
hee dealeth in a way of condeſcenſion with them; though they bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull
to him, yet he will be faithfull to them. Oh my brethren this point
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:42662:248"/>
hath abundance of ſweetnes in it, take heed of abuſing it; Thy ſins cannot
overcome Gods goodneſſe,<note place="margin">Quia ego dominus.</note> let Gods goodneſs overcome thy wickedneſſe.</p>
               <p>And they ſhal know the Lord, They ſhal know that I am the Lord, <hi>ſo the
Septuagint hath it; ſo the old Latin,</hi> thou ſhalt know becauſe I am the Lord;
<hi>but we rather reade it as it is in your bookes;</hi> They ſhall know the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But how comes this in,</hi> In faithfulneſſe, and they ſhall know the Lord.</p>
               <p>Thus, upon theſe two reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe this ſhall be the means to keepe the Church the Spouſe of
Chriſt in faithfulneſſe for ever, they ſhall know Chriſt to be the Lord. As if
Chriſt ſhould ſay, The reaſon of all your vile departings from me all this
while, what is it? you doe not know me, you doe not ſee into the bounty and
glory, into the excellency of my worſhip, and what I am, that is the reaſon
you are gone from me and have been unfaithfull to me, but when I betroth
you my ſelf again, you ſhall know me, you ſhall ſee ſo much beauty and
excellency in me &amp; mine Ordinances that you ſhall never depart from me.</p>
               <p>Low thoughts of God are the cauſe of ſuperſtitious vanities. Had men
high and honourable thoughts of God they would never thinke to put him
off with ſuch bauble-worſhip as they do. <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 7. it is ſaid <hi>the God of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
appeared to Abraham,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Obſer.</note> that is given as a ground why <hi>Abraham</hi> would
forſake his Countrey his fathers houſe and his kindred, if we once knew the
Lord, and that the God of glory had appeared to us, we would be ready to
forſake all for him and give up our ſelves unto him in an everlaſting cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>And they ſhall know me</hi>] This is as a fruit of my betrothing
my ſelf unto them,<note place="margin">The right knowing God is a fruit of the covenant.</note> as a fruite of the Covenant, <hi>Jer. 31. 34. They ſhal teach
no more every man his neighbour and every man his brother, ſaying, know
the Lord, for they ſhall know me from the leaſt of them unto the greateſt of
them, ſaith the Lord, for I will forgive their iniquity, &amp;c.</hi> It is a fruit of the
conjugall union betwixt Chriſt and the ſoul. As it is betwixt man and wife,
when they are but only ſuitors, well willers, they do not communicate their
ſecrets one to another, but when they once come to be marryed together,
then they open all their hearts, there is no ſecret but they will diſcloſe one to
another. So ſaith God, when I am once marryed to you, I will open my
whole heart to you, <hi>the ſecret of the Lord is with them that feare him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thoſe that have but natural knowledge, underſtands ſomething of the
wayes of Religion, of the minde of Chriſt; As a man that is in the dark may
know where he is, by feeling he may know what length and thickneſs ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things in the houſe are of, but when the light of the day comes, then hee
knowes what the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>is in the roome after another manner then he did in the
darke: this is the difference betweene knowledge of God in a natural man,
and the knowledge of one eſpouſed to Chriſt, by his naturall knowledge he
may underſtand the hyſtory of the Goſpell, he may have ſome generall no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of God and of Chriſt, but when the Sun of righteouſneſſe ariſeth, then
be ſees the excellency and glory of God, then he ſees God ſhining in all his
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:42662:248"/>
attributes, he ſees that in Chriſt which drawes his heart unto him in an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
Covenant. As we reade <hi>Cant. 7. 5. Chriſt is held in the galleries,</hi>
that is, Chriſt aſſoone as he is marryed to the foule, takes it as it were by the
hand, and walkes into the Galleries, and there openeth his heart unto her.
There is many a ſweet turne that a gracious heart hath with Chriſt in his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
wherin Chriſt openeth even his whole ſoul unto it, <hi>Joh. 15. 15. All
things,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>that I have heard of my Father, I have made knowne
unto you.</hi> An admirable Text, ſurely you cannot but know the Lord then.
Here is the fruit of our union with Chriſt. Oh that our hearts were inflamed
with deſire after further conjugall communion with him! according to the
capacity of the ſoul, ſo Chriſt makes knowne to it what he hath heard of the
Father. Certainly Chriſt hath heard great things of the Father; he is the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of the Father, he hath been with the Father from all eternity, and the
Father loves him, he will tell him all the glorious things he hath in his heart,
and Chriſt will hide none of thoſe things from his Saints. This is the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of a Saint;<note place="margin">

                  </note> who would not be godly, by which he ſhall come to know
the minde of the Father, according to what Chriſt knowes of it?</p>
               <p>Yea and Chriſt makes God known to the Saints in another way then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
know him. 2 <hi>Sam. 7. 27. Thou O Lord God of Hoſts haſt revealed
unto thy ſervant,</hi> ſo you reade it in your bookes, but it is in the Hebrew,
<hi>Lord thou haſt revealed this to the eare of thy ſervant.</hi> I wonder how that
word to the eare comes to be left out in your books, in which indeed the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis
lye, I am ſure it is ſo in the Text. When God makes known himſelfe
to his people he revealeth things to their <hi>Eare,</hi> as we to a friend who is inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
with us, we ſpeake a thing to his eare. There is many a ſecret which
JESUS CHRIST ſpeakes in the eart of his Saints, which others never
come to be made acquainted with, 2 <hi>Cor. 4. 6. God who commanded the
light to ſhine out of darknes, hath ſhined in our hearts, to give the light of the
knowledg of the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> It would aske time
for the full opening the gradations of this Scripture, here is <hi>knowledg,</hi> &amp; <hi>the
knowledg of the glory of God,</hi> &amp; <hi>the light of the knowledg of the glory of God,</hi>
and <hi>ſhining,</hi> and <hi>ſhining into our hearts,</hi> and <hi>into our hearts in the face of
Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Surely then they ſhall know the Lord, and they ſhall know
him in a very ſpirituall way. The light of the Saints is a light three ſtory
high; Firſt,<note place="margin">The light of the Saints is three ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries high.</note> they have the light of nature, which other men have, the light
of reaſon. Secondly, they have the light of common gifts, which other men
have too, and that is a ſtory higher then the other; Thirdly, they have the
light of a ſanctifying ſpirit, that is a third loft, and they ſhall come to a fourth
ſtory, and that is the light of glory. The light that other men have is but as
the light you have in a lower room, in ware-houſes, which in ſome you
know is ſo little that you are faine to uſe a candle at noone day, ſo ſome na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
men have onely the light of reaſon, which indeed is rather like your cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars

more light, they have common gifts, which is like the light in the next ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:42662:249"/>
ſomewhat more clear, but the light of the Saints is higher then all theſe,
they know God as their God, great is the excellency of his knowledge, the
ſoul hath bleſſed ſatisfaction in it, <hi>let us ſee the Father and it ſufficeth us,</hi>
the fulneſſe of glory that is let out into the ſoul, the ſanctification of the heart
by the preſence of the beams of the glory of God, being transformed into
the ſame Image, it is the very beginning of eternall life. Take onely this
note about our knowledge of God by Chriſt, what a different way have we
to know God by, from that which Heathens had. If you reade the Hyſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the Romanes, you ſhal find the poor &amp; mean ways of thoſe wiſe men
had to know God, as thus, they would look into the intrails of beaſts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to finde out the mind of their gods, they would obſerve how the beaſts
came to the ſlaughter, whether willingly or not willingly, whether haled or
not haled, they gueſſed ſomewhat at the minde of their Gods by that, then
they would looke into the colour of the bowels of the beaſts, then obſerve
whether the entrals were ſound or not, then they would obſerve the fire of
their ſacrifices, whether the flame aſcended right or not, thus they came to
know the mind of their Gods; What poor wayes are theſe? we have JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS
CHRIST God bleſſed for ever, the eternal Son of the Father, who
is come from the boſome of the Father,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4, 11.</note> to make all known to us, the mind of
God, his and our Father: We know the <hi>truth</hi> as it is <hi>in Jeſus,</hi> not onely as
it is in the works of nature; ſome know much of God in the works of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and providence, wee may know much of God in thoſe great things the
Lord hath of late done amongſt us; but to know the truth as it is in Jeſus, to
know God in Chriſt, this is another manner of knowledge then to know
God in the way of his works, here we ſee the truth really indeed when wee
ſee it in CHRIST JESUS. Certainly then none united unto Chriſt in
a conjugall union can be an ignorant ſot, for Chriſt ingageth himſelfe in his
faithfulneſſe, upon this marryage of a ſoul with himſelfe, to reveale himſelfe
and the Father unto it, <hi>Joh, 8. 54. Of whom ye ſay he is your God,</hi> but mark
the next words, <hi>yet ye have not knowne him.</hi> A likely matter that he ſhould
be your God and you not know him, a likely matter that Chriſt ſhould be
your Saviour and you not know him, ſeeing he hath ingaged himſelfe in his
faithfulneſſe, that if you bee married to him you ſhall know him and his
Father.</p>

<pb n="481" facs="tcp:42662:249"/>
and they ſhall heare the earth, and the earth ſhall hear the corne and the
wine and the oyle, and they ſhal heare Iezreel. Miraorationis ſublimit as,</hi>

a moſt beautifull and delightful <hi>proſopopoeia,</hi> ſaith another; theſe
creatures being put as it were in the perſon of a man as if they underſtood
what they did. As if the Lord ſhould ſay thus. My people, you indeed
through your ſinnes have been brought into great ſtraits, you have wanted
corne, and wine, and oyle, you have been ſcattered in your baniſhment, but
when I ſhall betroth my ſelf unto you and enter into a covenant with you,
then, when you ſhall cry, O that we might have theſe outward comforts,
preſently the corne, and the wine, and the oyle, as if they heard your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,
ſhall ſay, Oh Lord we would help, <hi>Jezreel</hi> and ſatisfie theſe thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants;
the corne ſhall cry to the earth, O earth let me come into your bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els,
I will rot there that ſo I may bring forth fruit for this people, the vines
and the olive ſhall deſire the earth to receive them, to give juice and nour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment
to them, that they may refreſh theſe reconciled ones to God; the
earth ſhall ſay, O that I could entertaine the corne, and wine, and oyle that
I may be fruitfull in my kinde, but O heavens I can doe nothing except I
have your influences and the ſhine of the ſun to warme mee to make mee
fructifie, therefore O heavens come in and aſſiſt me that I may fructifie
for <hi>Jezreel;</hi> and the heavens they ſhall cry, Lord, we would faine help
the earth, that the earth may helpe the corne, and wine, and oyle, that they
may ſupply <hi>Jezreel,</hi> but we can doe nothing without thine hand, therefore
doe thou heare us, do thou give us leave to raine upon the earth that it may
be fruitfull.<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> Thus the creatures are brought in crying to help <hi>Jezreel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Take theſe Obſervations.</p>
               <p>Firſt, See our condition in this world, though reconciled to God yet while
we are here we muſt be beholden to the corne, and wine, to the earth, and
heavens,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> we know not how to doe without them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, VVhen we are reconciled to God, then the creatures will be
ſerviceable to us, yea they will be greedy to do us good, they will cry for it.
Let us take heed of provoking God, the creatures then will be againſt us. I
have read of <hi>Cordius</hi> a martyr, giving this anſwer to thoſe who would have
had him deny the truth, if deny it ſaith he, the Sun, Moon, &amp; ſtarres will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
me light. If we ſerve God, the creatures will account it their happines to
ſerve us. Thirdly, God uſeth to work good for his people by ſecond cauſes.</p>
               <p>He doth not ſend theſe things immediately from heaven,<note place="margin">Obſ.</note> but the heavens
heare the earth, and the earth hears the corne and the wine. We muſt looke
to ſecond cauſes, but take heed of reſting upon ſecond cauſes. It hath been
Gods work amongſt us of late in finding out treacheries &amp; giving ſucceſſes
to manifeſt himſelf very ſtrangly when the means have been very poor; Nay
indeed God hath made as much uſe of mens weakneſſe, as of their ſtrength;
but let not us therefore be ſlack in the uſe of means, let us do the beſt we can,
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:42662:250"/>
though God ſometimes work beyond means, and contrary to means, yet
ordinarily he makes uſe of ſecond cauſes, not only to work, <hi>ad praeſent iam,</hi>
as <hi>Biel</hi> the Schoolman and others ſay, that is, only together with the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
but there is ſay they no efficacie at all of them iſſuing into the effect;
but the truth is, God doth make uſe of ſecond cauſes otherwiſe, ſo that there
is ſome vertue and efficacy in them to work the thing that God intends.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> there is a concatenation of ſecond cauſes, not onely an uſe of
them, but every one in their order ſupplyes the other, the heavens heare the
earth, and the earth hears the corne, one after another. If we could ſee the
comely order of the creatures, wee ſhould ſee them all hang together in a
golden chaine; as it is in the joynts of the body, one bone ſupplyeth another,
one place is hollow to take in another, ſo one cauſe in nature ſupplyeth, and
cometh in to the other. As in our ſalvation there is a golden chain which we
have <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. So in the creatures there is a golden chain of comely order and
mutuall ſupplyance.</p>
               <p>Fiftly,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> God is at the higher end of the chaine, and nothing can be done by
any link of the chaine of ſecond cauſes, but by Gods being at the uppermoſt
link. <hi>Jezreel</hi> muſt cry to the corn, and wine, and oyle, and they muſt cry
to the earth, and the earth muſt cry to the heavens, he muſt be the higheſt
cauſe.</p>
               <p>Sixtly,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> It is moſt comely, and a great bleſſing, when the right order and
chaine of ſecond cauſes hold; As it is in Nature, ſo in any Society, in a
Common-wealth, in a City, when all keep their due ſubordination, as when
the Tradeſ-man works in his way, the Magiſtrate in his way, the Miniſter
in his way, and every Officer in his place, every one keeping his order. But
when it is otherwiſe, when they are out of order, it is a great miſery upon a
City or Kingdom. As it was once among the Athenians, <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> ſaith
of his ſon, a bol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and my wife commands me, and my ſon commands
my wife; here was the concatenation of that government. God deliver all
ſocieties from ſuch a concatenation, that the beginning of any publick work, I
meane the lower link of the chain ſhould be perhaps in a whoremaſter, &amp; he
ſhould command one, and that one another, and ſo one after another. This is
a fearfull judgment where ſoever it is.</p>
               <p>7. God is the giver of all plenty,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> hee accounts it his glory to give raine.
<hi>Ier.</hi> 5. 24. God there wonders that men will not feare him becauſe of that,
<hi>Neither</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>doe they ſay in their hearts, Let us feare God that giveth
raine.</hi> As if hee ſhould ſay, It is a ſtrange impudence in men, what, will
they not ſay in their hearts, Let us feare God, ſeeing he gives us raine? Thus
God gloryeth in this great work, when hee heareth the heavens, and the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
heare the earth, the heavens will be as braſſe over us, and the earth as i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,
unleſſe GOD heare them, and ſend raine. Therefore let God be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
in that rain we have had of late; the creatures wanted graſſe,
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:42662:250"/>
and the graſſe cryed to the heavens, and the heavens cryed unto God, and
God hath heard the heavens, and ſent downe raine, and ſo we ſee the earth
hath been refreſhed, abundance of good hath come to us by thoſe ſhowers.
Give God the glory of this.</p>
               <p>8. All plenty is given for the ſake of the Saints.<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> How? God heares the
heavens, and the heavens hear the earth, and the earth hears the corn, and the
wine and the oyle, and they hear <hi>Jezreel.</hi> It is for <hi>Jezreels</hi> ſake that the earth
heares the corne, and the heavens hear the earth, and God hears the heavens.
Were it not for the Saints, the earth wauld ſoon come to a confuſion. <hi>They
are the bleſſing of the earth, Iſa.</hi> 18. 24.</p>
               <p>9. If the creatures work ſo graciouſly for us, how ſhould wee then worke
for God, and one for another. What, ſhall the creatures cry one to another,
and heare one another for our good, and ſhall God cry to us, and wee not
heare God? The ſenſeleſs corn cries to the earth. O earth help me that I may
help <hi>Iezreel,</hi> and the earth cryes to the heavens, O heavens ſend down your
influences, and the <hi>heavens</hi> ſay, <hi>We will heare,</hi> and the <hi>earth</hi> ſaith, <hi>I will
heare;</hi> Shall the <hi>earth</hi> heare, and the <hi>heavens</hi> heare for our good, and ſhall
not we hear when God cryes for help? God cries to you many times to helpe
in his cauſe, and wilt not thou hear to work for him? O vile creature, how
unreaſonable are thy ways before the Lord!</p>
               <p>Again, how ſhould we hear the cries of the poor? When wee are in want,
<hi>the corn cries to the earth, and the earth cries to the heavens, and the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
cry to God for us.</hi> VVhen the poore, I mean Gods poore, whom Gods
hand hath made poore, cry, will not you heare? VVill you be more hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted
then the <hi>earth and the heavens are?</hi> ſeeing they heare you, doe you
hear the cry of your poor brethren.</p>
               <p>Further, if God will hear the creatures when they cry for us, how much
more will he hear Jeſus Chriſt when hee cries for us? It is our happineſſe in
part, that we have all the creatures cry to God for our good, but the top of
our happineſſe is this, that wee have Ieſus Chriſt the Mediatour of the new
<hi>Covenant,</hi> making interceſſion at the right hand of God continually for us.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Gods mercies go through when they work for the Saints, the corn
beginneth to cry to the earth, that ſtays not here, but the earth goes on, and
cryes to the heavens, the heavens go on and cry to God. Gods mercies to his
Saints never leave till the thing be done.</p>
               <p>And I will ſow her unto me in the earth.</p>

that many ſhould be begotten to God. It is reported of <hi>Cicilia,</hi> in the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
of the Church, a poore Virgin, that by her gracious behaviour in her
mattyrdome, ſhe was the means of converting four hundred to Chriſt: As
in the Indies, one corn bringeth forth divers hundreds, ſo we ſhould labour
to convert as many as wee can, that ſome that live after may continue to
beare up the name of Chriſt, and the profeſſion of his truth. Eſpecially be
carefull of your children, leave them as ſeed to hold up the name of God in
thy family when thou art dead and gone.</p>
               <p>And further,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> 
                  <hi>I will ſow her to my ſelfe.</hi> The Saints are ſowen unto Chriſt
they are ſeed for Chriſt, therefore all their fruit muſt be given up unto Chriſt,
Chriſt muſt have all the fruit we bear: who ſhould have the fruit but he that
ſoweth it? Therefore <hi>Cant. 7. 13. All manner of pleaſant fruits new &amp; old
which I have laid up for thee O my beloved.</hi> Are we able to bear any fruit?
Let us lay it up all for Jeſus Chriſt, for it is he that ſoweth us unto himſelfe,
we muſt not ſow to our ſelves, not to the fleſh, for then wee ſhall reap cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
but all for Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And I will ſhew mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy.</p>
               <p>Divers things about Gods ſhewing mercy after rejection were ſpoken of
in the firſt Chap. Only theſe notes for the preſent.</p>
               <p>There are none ſo rejected,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> as that they can conclude that they ſhall never
have mercy (thoſe that have committed the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted)
though Iſrael had not obtained mercy, though they were caſt out,
yea caſt out to the beaſts to be devoured, yea ſaith God, <hi>I will ſhew mercy
upon her.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2.<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> Children of wicked parents may at length obtain mercy from God.
Though Iſrael be caſt off, yet her children ſhall have mercy. A comfort to
us in regard of the Idolatry of our fore fathers, yea a comfort in the regard of
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:42662:251"/>
the children that are to come. Our fore fathers have broken the Covenant,
why may not we obtaine mercy? But ſuppoſe we ſhould be the generation
of Gods wrath, and not obtaine mercy, yet we may have hope that the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity

be paſt;<note place="margin">Obſ.</note> if then it come, Oh it is ſweet mercy indeed! when ſhe ſeemed to
be utterly rejected, then to have mercy ſhewed, this is ſweet.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> Mercy is the cauſe of all the good the Saints have. One Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
for it, <hi>Pſal. 57. 3. Send from heaven</hi> ſaith <hi>David. David</hi> was in the
Cave, in a poor condition, hunted for his life, perſecuted by <hi>Saul;</hi> I ſee lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

ſhall God ſend Angels from heaven to deliver thee <hi>David?</hi> No, but mark
what followeth, <hi>God ſhal ſend forth his mercy &amp; his truth;</hi> as if he ſhould
ſay, Lord though I have no help in earth, though I ſee no Angels from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to helpe me, yet let me have thy mercy and truth, and that is enough.
This ſatisfies a gracous heart, if he may have Gods mercy and his truth, that
is Gods mercy revealed in a promiſe.<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> Laſtly, God hath a ſpeciall day of
mercy for his people, for his Churches; <hi>I will have mercy upon her that
hath not obtained mercy.</hi> Let us cry to God for the haſtening of this day,
let us open the miſeries of our own Kingdome, and of Ireland; Oh when
ſhall this day come that thou, wilt ſhew mercy to thy owne people which
thou haſt told us of! Oh that that day may haſten! Come Lord Jeſus, come

thou thinkeſt it is all in hypocrifie that thou doſt, whereas the truth is, it is the

Doe not anſwer Gods loving kindneſſe, and his gracious dealings towards

and tedious to his Spirit.<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> Thirdly, God works an anſwerable diſpoſition
in the hearts of his people unto him. This is thy duty, but God will work it
in time if thou belongeſt to him. As thus, doth God chuſe us to be his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?
then the hearts of the Saints chuſe him to be their God; Doth God
ſay, you are my people? the Saints ſay, Lord thou art our God; Doth
God ſay, I will dwell with them? they anſwer Lord, thou art our habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Doth God ſay, I delight in them? they ſay, Lord our delight is in thee.
Doth God ſay, I will reſt in them for ever? the Church ſaith, O my ſoule

kindnes.<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> Laſtly, the Saints muſt profeſſe God to be theirs. It is not enough
to beleeve with the heart, but thou muſt confeſſe with the mouth; profeſſe it
outwardly: of this before.</p>
               <p>Further,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> This is the higheſt happineſſe of the Saints, that God is their
God, when they can ſay this, they have enough. If we could ſay, this houſe
is mine, this ſtreet, this Lordſhip, this City, this Kingdome, this World is
mine; What is all this? A Chriſtian comes at length, and ſaith, this God
that made all is mine. As it is reported of the French Ambaſſador, and the
Spaniſh meeting together, ſaith the Spaniſh Ambaſſadour, my Maſter is
King of Spaine; my Maſter (replyed the French) is King of France; my
Maſter ſaid the Spaniard againe is King of Naples: and my Maſter ſaid the
French is King of France; my Maſter is King of Portugal, and my Maſter
is King of France; ſtill he anſwered with that my Maſter is King of France,
as being enough to anſwer all the ſeveral Kingdomes of the Spaniard. So
one ſaith, I have this houſe, this land, this ſtock, this eſtate, this trade, yea but
ſaith a Chriſtian, I have God, God is mine; Surely having him thou haſt
enough. And if God be thy God, he will be a God to thee. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17.

the gracious manifeſtation of God to his Church, in part fulfilled ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually,
to ſpiritual Iſrael here, but more ſenſibly to be made good at the

then his former. In the firſt Chapter God commanded him to goe and
<hi>take awife of whoredomes,</hi> but here God commanded him to <hi>love an adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſe,</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="489" facs="tcp:42662:253"/>
What that was of <hi>taking a wife of whoredomes</hi> hath been opened in the
former Chapter,<note place="margin">Lect. 1.</note> and may ſpare ſome labour in this. It is here a viſion as it
was there; As if God ſhould ſay unto <hi>Hoſea, Hoſea</hi> it is juſt with me as it
would be with thee, if thou ſhouldſt goe and have a wife an Adultereſſe,
notwithſtanding all the love ſhe hath found, yet ſtill an Adultereſſe, &amp; thine
heart ſhould be upon her, ſo as thou couldeſt not take thy heart from her, but
thou muſt needs love this Adultereſſe ſtill. This people whom I have loved,
for whom I have done ſo much good, yet they have gone a whoring from
me, they are an Adultereſſe, yet for all that my heart cannot be taken off
from them, but is ſtill toward them, yet I love them.</p>
               <p>This is through the ſtrength of the Covenant that Gods love is ſo perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.
Others who are not in covenant with him, God caſts out for leſſer ſins
for any ſins; but as for his people who are in Covenant with him, no not
their adulteries, their idolatries takes not the heart of God wholly from them.
Surely then, if thou canſt appeale to God. O Lord, thou knoweſt all things,
knoweſt that there is nothing of thy mind revealed to me but my heart is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to do it, and if I faile in any thing thou knoweſt it is the greateſt burden of
my ſoul; O that I knew more of thy minde! and that I had power to doe
more! ſurely God will love thee, you heare he loves his people though an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultereſſe,
as before, ſo now take this leſſon, thy ſinnes cannot over come
Gods goodneſſe, let Gods goodneſſe overcome thy ſinfulneſſe.</p>
               <p>An adultereſſe beloved of her friend.</p>
               <p>This is (as ſome carry it, <hi>Calvin, Vatablus,</hi> and many others) <hi>beloved of
her husband,</hi> as if God ſhould ſay, had they any ſuch excuſe for their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
from me, that I have been a bitter husband to them, that I have uſed
them hardly, and rigidly, then indeed they might have ſome plea; but I have
loved them dearly, I have done much for them, they were beloved of me, &amp;
I have carried my ſelfe to them in the moſt friendly way that poſſibly could
be, yet they are gone a whoring from me. The wife that followes other lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
thinks if ſhe have but this to ſay, her husband is hard to her, hee cares
not for her, he loves her not, it excuſes in part her adulteries; and ſo the husb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and,

other men, he thinks this is plea enough for him. But Iſrael could not have
this excuſe for her ſelfe, for ſhe was an Adultereſſe, yet beloved of the
Lord.</p>
               <p>If we take the words thus, the notes briefly would be theſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Obſ.</note> The husband ſhould be a friend to his wife. There ſhould be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but friendly carriage betweene man and wife; Yea the love of the
husband to the wife ſhould farr ſurmount the love of any friend in the world,
but a friend at leaſt to comfort her, to cherriſh her in time of ſorrowes, to
beare the burthen of affliction with her, and ſo the wife towards the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</p>
               <p>

                  <note place="margin">Obſer.</note> A baſe heart will be baſe againſt all bonds of love; <hi>beloved of
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:42662:254"/>
her friend, yet an adultoreſſe;</hi> if you ſhould ask, who is he or where is he that
is ſo baſe? Lay thy hand upon thine owne heart and conſider what the love
of God hath been towards thee all the dayes of thy life, and how thou haſt
carried thy ſelfe toward him, what love thou haſt had from God that might
breake the heart of a devill, yet when any temptation comes to draw thee
from God,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> thy baſe heart liſtens to it. Thirdly, It is a great aggravation
of ſin to ſinne againſt much love. We ought to doe our duties to thoſe that
we ſtand in relation unto, though they doe not their duty to us; if a wife hath
a froward husband, a bitter, churliſh rugged, wicked, ungodly husband, yet
ſhe is bound to doe her duty to him, ſhe is bound to love him, to obey him,
to be obſervant of him in what may give him all lawfull content. So if ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
have froward,<note place="margin">Love muſt not be abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</note> churliſh, cruel Maſters or Maſtreſſes, yet they are bound
to be obedient to them. 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 18. Be ſubject to your maſters not onely to
thoſe that rae good and gentle, but to the froward.</hi> It is no ſufficient excuſe
for the wife to ſay, My husband is froward and unquiet, and therefore what
ſhall <hi>I</hi> doe? Nor for the ſervant to ſay, My Maſter or Miſtreſſe are unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable,
they are cruell, what can I doe? You muſt doe your duty to them,
though they doe not theirs to you, But if you have a loving husband, tender
over you, then love is required much more. Love above all things ſhould
draw the heart; the knowledge that it is duty may force obedience, but it is
love that draws the heart moſt kindly. So if a ſervant have a godly Maſter
and Miſtreſſe, who reſpects and tenders his good, if he ſhould ſinne againſt
them, this aggravateth the ſinne exceedingly. To wrong love is a very great
ſin, <hi>Delicata res eſt amor,</hi> love is a moſt delicate thing, and it muſt not be
wronged, it is tender, a precious thing. A man who is of an ingenuous ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
had rather a great deale be wronged in his eſtate, then in his love; he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
beare the injury that is done unto his love; when his love is abuſed, that
goes to his very heart. So it goes to the heart of God for his people to ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
his love; therefore it is ſaid of the Saints when they ſinne, that they
grieve the Spirit of God; he never ſaith ſo of wicked men; they anger God,
but the Saints grieve him, becauſe they ſinne ſo much againſt Gods love.</p>
               <p>Charge this aggravation of your ſinne upon your hearts, and be humbled;
collect together all the expreſſions of Gods love to you, and let them lye
glowing at your hearts, and melt them.</p>
               <p>But in that God bids him take an Adultereſſe <hi>beloved of her friend,</hi> and
calls not this friend <hi>Husband,</hi> I thinke thoſe who goe another way expreſſe
the minde of the Holy Ghoſt in this more fully, thus: This <hi>friend</hi> is not
meant of one who is fully married, but rather one in a way of marriage. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the Jewes it was uſuall for all women to be under the protection of
ſome men or other. <hi>Eſay 4. 1. Seven women came and tooke hold of one
man, and ſaid, Let us be named by your name, we will eate our own bread,
and weare our own cloathes, onely let us be named by your name,</hi> let us be
under your protection. Even whores were wont, though they had many lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
yet to have ſome one ſpeciall man, under whoſe protection and care
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:42662:254"/>
they would be, who was to ſee them not to have wrong, and to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
for them, and ſuch a one they were wont to call their friend; And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times theſe friends would ſo provide for them, that if they would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claymed,
forſaking all their other lovers, they would give them good hopes
of marrying with them at length. <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> refers us to one <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertius,</hi>
in his firſt Book and ſecond Elegie, to reade about the charge and
care of ſuch a friend. The Grecians had that cuſtome likewiſe: they called
him under whoſe protection they put themſelves, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the whore was
called from it, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. It is ſaid of <hi>Plato</hi> that he had a whore, one <hi>Archenaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa,</hi>
who was called <hi>Plato's</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Here the Lord would have the Prophet
<hi>take an Adultereſſe beloved of her friend,</hi> that is, one that was a common
Adultereſſe, and yet under the protection of ſome ſpeciall friend, ſo as if he
might come in place of that friend, and gain the love and affection of this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultereſſe
to himſelf, and in time getting her to be reclaimed, he might mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
her unto himſelfe. This is <hi>according to the love of God to his people,</hi> that
is, as if God ſhould ſay, This people is a going a whoring, but I will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to take them unto my ſelfe, I will be as their friend, and ſo love them as
a friend to protect them, to have care over them, untill ſuch a time that there
may be ſome experience of their being reclaimed, and then I will marry this
Adultereſſe fully unto my ſelfe, for God is not now fully marryed unto the
Jews, neither will that marryage be untill that glorious time of their calling
comes; but yet God is as a friend to them to this day, that is, God takes this
people yet under his protection, though they ſeeme to be in a rejected con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and ſo, as he gives hope, yea makes many promiſes that upon their
return unto him he will marry them unto himſelfe; yea there ſhal be a more
glorious marriage between the Jews &amp; the Lord Chriſt, then ever yet there
was between him and any people upon the face of the earth. This I thinke to
be the very ſcope and meaning of the words, <hi>Beloved of her friend.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Somewhat ſutable is that we have <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 12. 13. when one of the Jews
took a captive woman, he might not marry her preſently to himſelf, but if
he had a love to her, ſhe was to continue a certaine time, and to be ſo and ſo
purified, and then he was to take her. The Jewes are for the preſent as that
captive woman, they are in bondage, yet God hath a love to them unto this
day; but ſo, as they muſt abide a while untill God be maryed to them; they
are beloved of God, but yet with the love of a friend. The Seventy reade
theſe words,<note place="margin">

               <p>Who looke to other gods.</p>

figit oculum,</hi> ſo <hi>Amor:</hi> Feare faſtens the eyes, and ſo doth Love. The
workings of the ſoule appeares as much in the eye, as in any member; the
workings of love, of truſt and confidence appeare much in the eye. <hi>They
looke to other gods,</hi> that is, they have confidence in other gods. Looking up
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:42662:255"/>
to a thing in Scripture phraſe, is to have ſome confidence in it. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 121. 1.
<hi>I lift up mine eyes unto the hills from whence commeth my help:</hi> That is, I
look for help, I have confidence and expect help. But how here <hi>to the hills</hi>
then? What doth <hi>Davids</hi> help come from the hills? Some thinke this to
be the place where afterward the Temple was built, and was then the place of
the Sanctuary; but for that it is ſaid that uſually in Scripture is but in the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
number, <hi>the hill of God;</hi> not <hi>the hils;</hi> therefore I finde <hi>Calvin, Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerus,</hi>
and others, thinke that <hi>David</hi> here ſpeakes of confidence in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
becauſe he preſently retracts him ſelfe in the ſecond verſe, <hi>My helpe
is in Jehovah.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, I lift up mine eyes unto the creature for
help, this is the frailty of my nature, and of the nature of man, to look for aux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iliary
Forces from Jeruſalem, (which was a hilly place) I looke for Forces to

(if it may be) free the Prophet from vaine confidence in the creature,
and ſo the words being rightly underſtood, may free him if you reade them
thus, doe I lift up mine eyes unto the hils? doe I expect help from the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?
God forbid I ſhould doe it, for my help is in God.</p>
               <p>Further, ſometimes the Hebrew [<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>] and ſo it would bee
tranſlated <hi>above the hils,</hi> other men look to the hils, I look above the hils.
But rather thus, <hi>I lift up mine eyes to the hils,</hi> that is, I look to God, why?
becauſe the place where the Temple was to be built, it was not onely upon
one hill, but upon hils, and ſo this expreſſion hath reference to thoſe two hills
it was built upon; the hill of <hi>Moriah</hi> and the hill of <hi>Zion</hi> (which were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
but two ridges of the ſame) as 2 <hi>Chron. 3. 1. Solomon began to build
the houſe of the Lord upon mount Moriah;</hi> and <hi>Pſal. 2. 6. I have ſet my
King upon my holy hill of Zion:</hi> I look ſaith <hi>David</hi> unto God, my Faith
hath reference to that place that God hath choſen for himſelf;<note place="margin">Ezek. 23. 27.</note> that this is the
meaning will appeare if we compare this with <hi>Pſal. 87. 1. His foundation
is in the holy hils,</hi> not <hi>hill,</hi> but <hi>hils.</hi> The reſpect Idolaters had to their Idols,
being manifeſted by lifting up their eyes to them, therefore God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them, that they muſt not ſo much as lift up their eyes to their idols;
And indeed we had need take heed in what we doe in this, ſo much as to lift
up our eyes to look upon the inticements of the fleſh; many will not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
their former ſins, but they love to be looking that way. I have read of a
Lady, a loving wife, who being at the maryage of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> ſhe was askt how
ſhe liked the Bridgeroom? how, ſaith ſhe? <hi>I</hi> know not, <hi>I</hi> ſaw no body but
my Husband. Love and reſpect drawes the eye either to God or to the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature.
According as our hearts are, ſo our eyes will be.</p>

                  </note> The word comes from a word that ſignifies
<hi>fundavit.</hi> The old Latin turns it <hi>vivacia uvarum,</hi> the leaves, skinnes, and
ſtones of the grape that remaines after preſſing, that ſinke down into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
of the veſſell. Noting thereby how ſapleſſe, and ſavourleſſe, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
Idolatrous worſhip is in compariſon of the true worſhip of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="493" facs="tcp:42662:255"/>
True worſhip of God is ſweet, and ſavoury, lovely, and excellent, but
mans inſtitutions, how ſapleſſe are they! The ſpirits of ſuch men as pleade
for and delight in ſuperſtitious vanities, the deviſes of men, how ſapleſſe and
unſavoury do they quickly grow! though heretofore they have had ſome
quickneſſe and livelineſſe in their wayes, yet if once they delight themſelves
in the inventions of men, in Gods worſhip, their ſpirits grow very unſavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to thoſe with whom they converſe.</p>
               <p>But take the traſlation as it is in your books, <hi>flaggons of wine,</hi> called by
this name in the Hebrew, becauſe that veſſell, the flaggon is broad in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome:
That is, (as ſome carry it) thus, They are as drunkards that call for
one flaggon after another. Superſtitious and idolatrous people, when they
have one way of ſuperſtition, they call for another; and when they have got
that, they will have another, and are ſtill greedy of more, they are never ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
as drunkards are greedy of their flaggons.</p>
               <p>Or rather, to note the ſenſuality of the wayes of their Idolatrous worſhip,
their flaggons of wine are joyned to their gods. The Seventy tranſlate the
word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Bellaria,</hi> fine Cates and junkets, delicate things made with
wine and grapes together by all the art they can deviſe for the pleaſing the
appetite.<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> From thence the note is cleare.</p>
               <p>Spirituall adultery and carnall ſenſuality goe together. They uſed flag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons
of wine in their idolatrous ſolemnities, that made them love their Idols
ſo much the rather. In the true worſhip of God there is abundance of
ſweetneſs to ſatisfie the hearts of the Saints, they need not have ſenſual plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
to make up their delight, but in ſuperſtitious worſhip there is no ſuch
ſweetneſs to ſatisfie the ſpirits, therefore they are ſaine to call for flaggons of
wine, and other ſenſuall things to make up a full delight to themſelves.</p>
               <p>Superſtitious and idolatrous Rites bring with them pleaſure to the fleſh,
hence how are they loved and followed by people? they can hardly ever be
taken off from them.<note place="margin">Idolatry and ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality goe together.</note> In their Idolatrous ſolemnities they were wont to
have Feaſts to pamper the fleſh. <hi>Judg. 9. 27. They went out into the field,
and gathered their vineyards, and trod the grapes, and were merry, &amp; went
into the houſe of their God, and did eate and drinke, and curſed Abimelech.</hi>
So <hi>Amos. 2. 8. They drinke the wine of the condemned in the houſe of their
God.</hi> What is that? By oppreſſion and violence they would rend the eſtates
of men from them, and when they had gotten them, then they made merry,
yea they would come into the houſe of their gods, and drinke bowles of wine
that they had gotten from the eſtates of ſuch men whom they had wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
condemned, Let Idolaters have their luſts ſatisfied, and they care not
what God they ſerve. 2 <hi>Cor. 8. 10. If any ſee them ſit at meate in the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols
temple; at meate,</hi> they had their fleſh ſatisfied in the Idols temple.</p>
               <p>Thus God complaines of his people here. As if he had ſaid, Let all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moane
my condition, for though <hi>I</hi> have loved Iſrael dearly, ſhe hath gone a
whoring from me, and ſhe loveth flaggons of wine, becauſe ſhe hath more
pleaſure to the fleſh in ſerving Idols, ſhe will ſerve them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="494" facs="tcp:42662:256"/>
What an abominable thing it is to forſake the bleſſed God meerly for the
love of wine? How many are there in the world who forſake all that good
that is in God, in Chriſt, in heaven, in eternity, meerely for flaggons of
wine?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Calvin</hi> hath a note from the word that carries ſome-what more with it,
<hi>flaggons of grapes,</hi> ſo the words are in the Hebrew, not <hi>flagons of wine,</hi> and
of <hi>grapes</hi> rather then <hi>wine</hi> ſaith he, becauſe there were artificiall wayes uſed
by them to make their ſuperſtitious ways to be more pleaſant to them; As
when drunkards have drunk even <hi>ad nauſeam,</hi> that they begin to loath what
they delighted in, then they will uſe ſome artificiall way or other of mixture
of grapes or ſome other thing with the wine to make it have a new taſt, that
they may have ſtill delight in drinking; So (ſaith he) becauſe their old ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions
have nothing in them to ſatisfie the heart, therefore they are fain to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
new kinds of artificiall wayes to pleaſe themſelves withall, although
(ſaith he) they brag of their antiquity, yet the truth is, they are fain to invent
new things every day, to give a new luſtre and pomp to their worſhip, they
are alwayes deviſing ſome new ceremony or other, or elſe it would grow
loathſome to themſelves. This wee have ſeene in our owne experience, the
wantonneſſe of mens hearts in ſuperſtitious ways is very great, they invent
new ways to uphold their old moth-eaten vanities.</p>

               </p>
               <p>There is a neceſſity for the opening theſe words, not onely that you may

ſome other Scriptures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifteen pieces of ſilver;</hi> How much is that? It is fifteen ſhekels, for that is
a rule among the Hebrews, when a piece of ſilver is named, and not the
ſumme; then a ſhekel is always underſtood, and when a ſhekel is ſet down,
and the mettall not expreſt, the ſilver is underſtood, not gold or any other
mettall. Now the common ſhekell was according to the account of ſome
of the weight of 160. graines of barley. <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſaith it was about foure
Drachmas (and ſo I find moſt carry it) about 18. or 20. pence of our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;
though a great deale of difference there be among Interpreters about
the ſum of that ſhekell; <hi>Jerome</hi> upon the fourth of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> makes it half an
ounce, but there is much difference you know about ounces.</p>
               <p>This was to ſignifie the vile and baſe condition that Iſrael had brought her
ſelfe into, for thirty ſhekels of ſilver was to be given for the price of a maid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervant,
<hi>Exod. 21. 32. If an oxe have puſhed a man-ſervant, or a woman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervant,
he ſhal give to his Maſter thirty ſhekels.</hi> Thirty ſhekels muſt be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

muſt buy this adultereſs for half as much, fifteen ſhekels. Iſrael, all the tenn
Tribes, yea the whole people of the Jews are ſignified by this adultereſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
of her friend: So that now the people of Iſrael, who heretofore the dear
ly beloved of Gods ſoul, his only people upon the face of the earth, the peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
treaſure of God, his portion, his inheritance, had now by their ſin brought
themſelves into a meaner condition then any poore bond-woman in <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
that they were worth but halfe as much now as a poor woman-ſlave. This
thirty pieces of ſilver was the goodly price Chriſt was valued at by the <hi>Jews,
Zech. 11. 12. Mat.</hi> 27. 9. This ſhewed how Chriſt was humbled, that he
muſt bee ſold for no more then was the price of a ſlave. But the price of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>

proſperity, but now ſhe hath brought her ſelf by her ſin into a meaner condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
then a ſlave.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And for an homer of barley, and an halfe homer of barley.</hi> What that
<hi>homer of barley</hi> was, and what the ſcope of the holy Ghoſt is in mentioning
of it muſt be enquired. Firſt, an homer contained ten Ephaes. But by that
(you will ſay) we know no more then we did. An Ephah then is neer upon
as much as our buſhell, ſo that this homer is neer upon tenne of our buſhels.
<hi>Ruth</hi> 2. 17. it is ſaid of <hi>Ruth</hi> that when ſhegleaned in the field after the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
ſhe beat out that ſhe had gleaned, and it was an <hi>Ephah</hi> of barley. And
by that you may know the meaning of that text, <hi>Eſay 5. 10. The ſeed of an
homer ſhall yeeld an Ephah;</hi> why a homer was ten buſhels, how then ſhould
the ſeed of neer tenn buſhels yield but one buſhell? It was a threatning of a
famine, that though they did ſow much, they ſhould reape but little, they
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:42662:257"/>
ſhould ſowe a matter of ten buſhels, and reape but one.</p>
               <p>Or thus, ſome interpret an <hi>homer</hi> to be about the burthen that an Aſſe was

               </p>
               <p>There is a great deale of difficulty to underſtand this, if we compare it
with another Scripture, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 16, where the Text ſaith they were <hi>to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the Manna every man according to his eating, an homer for every
man;</hi> and <hi>ver. 36. an homer is the tenth part of an Ephah.</hi> This ſeems quite
contrary, here it is that an ephah is the tenth part of an homer, and there it is
that an homer is the tenth part of an ephah. But for the ſalving of this, thoſe
who are skilfull in the Hebrew tongue know that theſe words are written
with different letters, though in our Engliſh the pronounciation is the ſame,
for that in <hi>Exodus</hi> is written with [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] and the other [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] one thus Gnomer,
the other Chomer, ſo it ſhould be read. Now this homer of Manna that
God gave for every man for one day, was almoſt the tenth part of a buſhell,
it was foure or five times as much as the Romanes were wont to allow their
men, their <hi>Dimenſum</hi> which they called a <hi>Chaenix,</hi> which was their allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
for their ſervants, was but the fourth part of this, and ſcarce that; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereby, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> God is exceeding liberall unto his people.</p>
               <p>But why an homer of <hi>barley;</hi> Becauſe it was a meane food, and in thoſe
times rather the food of beaſts then of men; God promiſed to feed his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
with the fineſt flower of wheate. Therefore <hi>Revel. 6. 5. A meaſure of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>heate for a penny, and three meaſures of barley for a penny.</hi> But what doth
this tend to, that there muſt be a homer of barley and halfe a homer of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
given for this Adultereſſe that the Prophet was to take unto himſelfe?
The ſcope of all is, to ſignifie the meane condition, that the ten Tribes, and
afterward all the Jews ſhould be in, till Chriſt came to marry them to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.
Firſt they ſhould be in a contemptible condition, they ſhould be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued
but at halfe the price of a ſlave. Secondly, they ſhould be fed but mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and baſely, even as ſlaves, or rather as beaſts, this homer and half of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
ſhould be for their ſuſtenance, in which they ſhould be uſed very hardly
for along time. And that you may ſee how this hath been fulfilled, (for it
did not only refer to the time of their Captivity before Chriſt, but to all the
Captivity they have been in ever ſince Chriſts time to this day, and ſhall be
in untill their calling) the mean condition they were in before, in the time of
their firſt Captivity, you may ſee <hi>Lament. 4. 5. Thoſe that were clothed in
ſcarlet, embraced the dung-hill;</hi> they either lay in filthy places that had
dung in them, like beaſts, or elſe they were imployed in carrying dung up
and down. And to this day, Hiſtories tell us, that generally the Jews have
a moſt ſtinking ſavour, and we know that they are the vileſt people in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme
of others that are upon the face of the earth. An Hiſtorian tells us of
an Emperour travelling into Egypt, there meeting with ſome Jews, he was
ſo annoyed with the ſtink of them, that he cryes out, <hi>O Marco-mani, O
Quadi, &amp;c.</hi>

we reade of the Romanes, that when they conquered other Nations, they
would permit them to call themſelves Romanes, after they had conquered

tels us that in the exactions that the Romanes require of people, they put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Jews more then upon all people. This that we reade of in hiſtories,

               <p>Notes from hence are.</p>
               <p>Firſt, A people who have been high in outward glory, when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from God, make themſelves vile and contemptible, God caſts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
upon wicked men, eſpecially upon wicked men who corrupt his
worſhip. Do we not ſee it at this day? <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 9. It is threatned that the
Prieſts who departed from the law, &amp; corrupted their waies ſhould be baſe
and contemptible before the people. Hath not the Lord done thus at this
day? even thoſe that not long ſince gave themſelves the title of the trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
Clergy and the triumphant Church, and went up and downe jetting
as if they would out-face heaven it ſelf; They feared all men with the High
Commiſſion Court. But what ſhame hath God caſt upon this generation?
the people loath them, and we hope in time the Lord will ſweepe away the
proud and haughty of them, as the reffuſe of the earth. Yea our whole nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
hath been a proud nation;<note place="margin">Sin puts into a vile con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</note> what vaunting hath there been of what a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Church we had? never ſuch a one upon the earth, we ſate as a Queen
amongſt the nations; we have been a haughty people, and God may juſtly
caſt contempt upon us. The Jewes were ſo (the Temple of the Lord, the
temple of the Lord) but God hath now made them the vileſt nation upon
the earth. And the truth is, God hath begun to caſt much ſhame upon this
nation. The time was when the Kingdom of England was a terror to other
people, of late they have been the ſcorne and contempt of other nations.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="498" facs="tcp:42662:258"/>
                  <hi>When Ephraius ſpake there was trembling; he exalted himſelfe in Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,
but ſinning it Baal he died,</hi> he became as a dead, poor, vile, contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
people. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13. 1. The Lord loveth to name the pride of men. How
many have you known who have been proud and lofty, and the Lord hath
caſt ſhame and contempt in their ſaces? even before thoſe whom they loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
upon heretofore with contempt, they have now been made objects of
contempt.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Obſ.</note> Though a people be under contempt, yet Gods heart may be
towards them to doe them good at the latter end. There is the love of Gods
election ſtill to this people, God remembers them, and intends good unto
them for all this. VVho knowes what contempt God may caſt upon us?
Perhaps he may let our proud adverſaries trample us under their feet, but
we hope he will not, becauſe he ſees their hearts ſo proud as they are. But if
he ſhould, we ſhould not deſpaire, we muſt not conclude God hath quite
caſt off England, though he ſhould bring all his people under contempt, ſo
as to betrampled under the foot of pride. And if there be any of you whom
God hath ſo humbled as he hath made you contemptible; doe you humble
your ſelves before God, but do not deſpaire, the Lord may yet have a love to
you, though you are now under ſhame and contempt, who knowes but that
this was the only way that God had to humble your hearts? God putteth
his ovvn people under contempt, and yet it is all out of love unto them, and
vvithan intent to do them good at laſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, (which is the moſt eſpecial note hence) After many promiſes of
Gods mercy and of a glorious condition,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> which he intendeth his people, he
may yet hold a very hard hand over them a great while, God having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
ſo much mercy in the former Chapter, Iſrael might quickly grow
vvanton, and ſay it is no great matter, though we be vile and wicked, yet
God will marry us to himſelf, and we ſhall be a glorious people, and what
need we take care? Nay ſaith God ſtay here, though my heart be toward
you,<note place="margin">Thoſe to whom God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends great mercy, may for a long time be in a ſad conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> yet this generation ſhall ſuffer, and the next generation, &amp; the next ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
after that ſhall ſuffer hard things, you ſhal be brought into the moſt
vile condition that ever any people was brought into, yet my promiſe ſhall
be fulfilled at the laſt. Here we ſee what care God taketh that people ſhould
not grow wanton with his mercy, and think, Oh we are in covenant with
God, and God hath pardoned our ſins, what need we care? take heed of
growing want on, thou maiſt ſuffer fearfull things in this world. Though God
may ſave your ſouls, yet you may be brought into as wofull a condition in
your ovvn apprehenſions as ever any creature was upon the earth. And for
England, though it is true, we have as many arguments of the love of God to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> as ever any nation had, but yet who knows what this generation may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
that hath ſo ſullied it ſelf with ſuperſtitious vanities? We may be brought
into vvefullſlavery, and then God may raiſe up unto himſelf another gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
upon whom he will be ſtow the mercy intended.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> Thoſe who will take their fill of delight to the fleſh in a ſenſual
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:42662:258"/>
uſe of the creature, it is juſt with God they ſhould be cut ſhort, &amp; be made
to live meanly and baſely, to be made to feed with courſe fare, with barley.
The Jews had their delicates before, they fared deliciouſly, now they muſt
be ſed worſe then their ſervants, and eare that which was meate for beaſts.
How many hath God thus dealt withall, who not long ſince had their tables
furniſhed with the choyſeſt ſare, with variety of diſhes, &amp; now perhaps are
glad of a harley loafe for themſelves and their children?</p>
               <p>Again,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> If God will not utterly deſtroy a people as he might, but reſerve
mercy for them at laſt, though they have never ſuch a meane ſubſiſtence for
the preſent, yet they have cauſe to bleſſe God. Though this here be a threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
yet there is a promiſe in it. The people of Iſrael (if they knew all) had
no cauſe to murmur at Gods dealing, but to admire at his mercy, though
they had but a little barley to ſuſtaine them. And ſuppoſe God ſhould bring
us in England into a low condition, ſo as we may be glad of a barley loafe
(we know famine commonly followes warre) (it was wont to be a phraſe;
<hi>browne bread and the goſpell is good fare</hi>) and God may bring that upon us
in another way then ever yet we or our fore-fathers were acquainted with,
but yet if the Lord do not caſt us off utterly from being his people, though he
feed us with brown bread, though we have never ſo mean a ſubſiſtance for
the preſent, we ſhall have cauſe to bleſſe his name.</p>
               <p>Laſtly,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> It is the way of God to humble thoſe he intendeth good unto, to
prepare them for mercy, by cutting them ſhort of theſe outward comforts.
If the Lord hath dealt ſo with any of you, you have lived full-handed, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
wives have brought good portions to their husbands, and now they are
broke, and all is loſt, perhaps you had good friends in the Countrey, &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them are plundered in their eſtates, &amp; now you are faine to fare mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and if you have bread for your children you think it well; but conſider
this, Is not God now humbling me, and thereby preparing my heart for
himſelf? Oh bleſſed be God for this my condition, this bread is ſweeter to
me then all the diſhes I have had in my life. VVhen you ſit in your houſes
with your wives and children, and have nothing but barley bread to feed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
have theſe thoughts, I hope God doth this in love &amp; mercy he is making
this my condition the beſt condition I was ever in, the greateſt bleſſing to me</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe</hi> 3. And I ſaid unto her, thou halt abide for me many dayes,
thou ſhalt not play the harlot, and thou ſhalt not be for another man, ſo

               <p>You ſhall not only be in ſuch a low condition as a ſlave, and worſe then a
maid ſervant, and be ſed with barley, but you ſhall abide thus, &amp; abide thus
many dayes. Thus they have abode theſe ſixteene hundred yeares ſince
Chriſts time, beſides their former captivity. The Lord would have a full
experience of Iſrael that their hearts were throroughly humbled, before he
would take them to mercy again. There was never any people dealt more
falſely with God in their humiliations then they had done before. How often
when they were in miſery did they come with their ſeeming humiliation &amp;

out things that hinder the match between her lover and her ſelf. Well ſaith

many things, yet I will have him, I will never marry as long as I live except

many things are to be done before that day, and then after you have ſtayed,
I will come to you in a glorious manner. As God dealeth with the Jews, ſo
often it is in marrying himſelf to a particular people.</p>
               <p>Thou ſhalt do it.</p>
               <p>God doth not only command them to do it, but it is a promiſe and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie
that they ſhall doe it. But you will ſay, how have the people of the

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ews abode for God? Thus, they have never to this day choſen any other
God, though they have not been convinced of the Meſſiah, yet ever ſince
the captivity they have hated Idolatry, &amp; that was the thing GOD ſpecially
meant in this, thou ſhalt not have any more Idols, thou ſhalt chooſe no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
God, no other husband, though thou haſt been very wicked and ſinfull
this way heretofore (the <hi>Jews</hi> formerly choſe all manner of gods, the gods
of the <hi>Amorites,</hi> and <hi>Moabites,</hi> and of all the <hi>Heathens</hi> about them) yet
now thou ſhalt chooſe no other gods but me; thus far this is fulfilled, to this
day the <hi>Jews</hi> ſince the captivity have never choſe any other God, but have
acknowledged the <hi>Jehovah</hi> to be the only true God, they cannot abide <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages.</hi>
There is a notable hiſtory for this in <hi>Euſebius,</hi> in the 18. Chapter of
his Antiquities. <hi>Caius Caligula</hi> ſent one <hi>Petronius</hi> to ſet up an Image in
the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> divers of the <hi>Jewes</hi> came to <hi>Petronius</hi> to plead
with him, and ſaid, Sir, what is it that you do? we beſeech you do not do it,
dep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ive us of our lives firſt, for ſay they, it is impoſſible ſo long as our ſoules
are in our bodies to abide it, we will all dye firſt; But ſaith <hi>Petronius,</hi> it is
the command of the Emperour, and there is no contradicting it, it muſt be
done. They anſwered, ſeeing you will not tranſgreſſe <hi>Caeſars</hi> command,
neither vvill we violate the command of our God, nor are we ſo fainthearted,
or have wee ſuch a vaine deſire of the continuance of our lives, as to enjoy
them upon ſuch terms to loſe the reward of eternall life, that is propoſed for
the keeping Gods commands. This was their ſpirit then, and to this day they
will not endure Idols; one main thing that hinders the converſion of the <hi>Iews</hi>
is, they being ſcattered here and there among <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and ſeeing ſo much
Idolatry among them, they are thereby ſtumbled at Chriſtian Religion, and
if God would once pull down Popery, certainely the <hi>Jewes</hi> would quickly
come in, God is now about that. Therefore all of us ſhould aſſiſt in what we
can to take down all monuments of Idolatry, to make the worſhip of God
more pure, this will be a means to bring about their converſion, and in this
regard they have abode for God all this while; this I conceive to be the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Text.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And I alſo will abide for thee.</hi> VVhat is the meaning of that? Firſt, in
their captivity, ſaith God, though you ſhal be long in captivity, and in a low
condition, be content, do not take any other god to be marryed unto as your
husband; I will be content, I will ſtay, I will have no other people upon the
earth but you all the while you are in captivi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But how doth God abide for Iſrael now? God hath choſen the Gentiles
how the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> doth he ſtay for them?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="503" facs="tcp:42662:260"/>
Yes certainly, God ſtayes for Iſrael to this day, thus. Firſt, all the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
that are called, they come into God, as being joyned to the people of
the Jews; God honoured the Jews ſo farre, as that all the Gentiles that doe
come in, are to be made the Iſrael of God.</p>
               <p>But rather further thus, God abides for the people of the Iews to this day,
in this ſenſe, God never hath taken, nor never will take to himſelfe any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon the earth to be a nationall Church, as the <hi>Jewes</hi> were, and as it is
probable the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhall be at their calling again, though God takes the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
that are converted, and ſeverall Congregations to be Churches, but to
marry himſelfe to a whole Nation, in that way as the Iews were, that is, if a
man be born of that Nation, it ſhall be ſufficient to make him a member of
the Church, this God did never do ſince the Iews rejection, and never will
do it till the Iews be called again; though God takes Kingdomes, and ſo in
ſome figurative ſenſe a Nation perhaps may be called a Church, but to
ſpeak properly and ſtrictly, to be a Church ſo as the Iews were, there is no
ſuch nationall Church, nor never will be till the calling in of the Iews again;
then God will be marryed to that Nation in a more glorious manner then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
&amp; God abideth to this day for that glory which hee intendeth for Ieſus
Chriſt, untill they come in. And this I take to be a great reaſon why God
for the preſent ſuffers his Churches to bee perſecuted ſo much as they are,
herein God ſuffers himſelfe as well as they; the Church ever ſince Chriſts
time hath been in a low and perſecuted condition, the wicked have prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;
What is the reaſon? God abideth for this people of the Iews, and hee is
pleaſed himſelf to undergoe many ſufferings, in the mean time do you abide
for me, I will be content to ſuffer much diſhonour my ſelfe, many ſhall
come in to Chriſt, but yet they ſhal be a poor contemptible people, the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
of the world ſhall prevail againſt them, ſhall ſcorn them, ſhall contemne
them, ſo that I ſhall not appear to the world to be their Husband, untill you

ſhall be a moſt glorious Church, and then there ſhall be ſuch a full marriage
between us, that all the world ſhall acknowledge it, then they ſhall all come
and ſay, Come, behold the Bride, the Lambs wife, This is the ſcope of this
Scripture; from whence theſe Obſervations.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> Husbands ſhould not require of their wives any thing but what they

and <hi>I will abide for you,</hi> there ſhall be <hi>parpari,</hi> like for like. Many husbands
will require hard things from their wives, but will doe little themſelves; and
on the other ſide wives expect great things from their husbands, but do little
themſelves. There muſt be a proportion betweene what the wife expects
from the husband, and what ſhee doth to or for her husband, and ſo mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually.</p>

concerns us to deſire it, we ſuffer ſomething for want of it, but God ſuffers
more.</p>
               <p>3. That people,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> or that ſoul that endureth hardſhip a long time for God,
and reſolveth to reſerve it ſelf for him, ſo as if it cannot have comfort in God
it will have none elſewhere, may aſſure it ſelfe that God reſerveth himſelfe
for it. Certainly nothing ſhall take off the heart of God, but there will be a
bleſſed marriage between that ſoule, that people, and him. Is there ever a
poor creature here is in a ſad condition, &amp; God ſeemeth to deal hardly with
it, yet hee findeth in himſelfe this frame of ſpirit, well though God ſeem to
leave me, and I am thus deſolate, yet if I can have no comfort here, I will
have none elſewhere; I wil be content to ſtay and wait, no creature ſhal have
my heart. It is true, I am not able to guide my ſelfe, but <hi>I</hi> am reſolved the
Devil ſhal never guide me; <hi>I</hi> am not able to do the will of God, but <hi>I</hi> will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

leave me eternally, <hi>I</hi> wil never have any other husband, <hi>I</hi> wil rather dye a
widow, <hi>I</hi> wil never let out my ſelf to any; if he doe not come in and marry

frame? Peace be unto thee, certainly God intends thoughts of mercy to thy

it thus; thou canſt not goe up to heaven to know it, but go into thine owne
heart and there thou mayeſt know. As a man may know by the working
of an engine within, how the workings are abroad. That is the reaſon that
the Saints, when they have had their hearts enlarged in prayer, they have
come to be reſolved what God will do for them or for his Church; as it is
ſaid of <hi>Luther,</hi> when he was in prayer one time more then ordinarily earneſt
with God, he comes down to his frinds and ſaith, well it ſhall goe well with
Germany all my dayes, look ye to it afterward: he knew what was done
in heaven, by what was done in his own heart. We may know in a great
meaſure what God meaneth to doe with his Churches according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
beatings of our own hearts.<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> Further, See here the happy advantage of
the Saints, beyond the men of the world thus: <hi>Be you for me</hi> ſaith God, &amp; <hi>I
will be for you.</hi> The men of the world can ſay, I am for the world, &amp; the world
is for me, I am for my honour, and my honor is for me, I am for my whore,
and my whore is for me, this is all their happines, but now a Saint can ſay, I
am for God, and God is for me. Oh the goodneſs of God toward us, that he
is willing to be for us as we are for him! for him, alas what can we be for
him? we are poor worms, vile creatures in our ſelves, what can we do? he
hath no need of us, we are bound to do all that we do. It is all one as if a king
ſhould come to a poor beggar, &amp; ſay thus, poor man thou haſt but little, yet
do what you can for me, I will do what I can for you; this were a mighty diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion:
Alas what can the beggar do for the King? If you will but uſe
your ſtaffe or what you have for me, I will uſe my riches, &amp; glory, and all for
your good;
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:42662:262"/>
ſaith the King to the beggar. So ſaith God to a poore creature, Be you for
me, and I will be for you; ſtand for me, and I will ſtand for you; uſe any
thing you have forme, and I will uſe what I have for you. Oh the bleſſed
condition of the Saints! who would not be for God? Do not now ſay, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las!
I am a poore vile and unworthy creature, ſo were the Jews, do not ſay
I am gone a whoring from God, and dealt falſely with him, the Jews did ſo,
yet ſaith God, whenſoever you will be for me, I will be for you, It is now
the great queſtion amongſt us, who are you for? I will put the queſtion to
you all, who are you for? Are your hearts wholly given up to God, or are
you for your luſts for the creature? certainly the creature will deceive you ere
long, you will have no good from the creature that now you are ſo much for;
if you be not for God now, hee will ſend you to the creature in the time of
your diſtreſſe. There is a time comming that every one of us ſhall ſee the
need we have that God be for us; let us be for God now, that God may be
for us then, when we come to cry to him, and ſay, Oh Lord, let thy mercy
and goodneſſe be for us, he will ſay, who were you for? you were for your

both in places of judgement, and in the houſe of God, and now there
comes upon them abundance of confuſion both in their Civill and in their
Church ſtate. They received their order for both from God himſelf, from
heaven, and their Laws as well for Cvill as for Church Government, which
no other people yet ever did in the ſtate manner; but they leave Gods inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuions,
and ſo they are brought into all confuſion.</p>
               <p>They ſhall be without a King.</p>
               <p>How <hi>without a King?</hi> When they were in captivity, yet they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

               <p>They have Kings over them,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> but they have none of their own Nation to
be their King, and that is the judgement; Neither are they governed by their
own (or rather) by Gods Laws, and for them to be in ſlavery under Kings,
was to them as ill (yea worſe) then to have no King at all.</p>
               <p>It is a ſad condition for a people to be ſo without a King, to protect them,
without a King to maintaine their Laws, their Priviledges and Liberties.</p>
               <p>When men reject God from ruling over them, it is juſt with God to put
them under the rule of Tyrants, of Oppreſſors, of publike enemies unto their
ſtate, of deſtroyers. The bleſſing of government is very great, if it be right,
and therefore the Perſians were wont after their Governor dyed to let all the
people for five dayes be without any governour at all, that ſeeing the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
and miſchiefe of being without it, they might the more willingly
yeeld themſelves under Government, and be obedient to it when they came
under it. It is a queſtion among Polititions, whether Tyrannie or Anarchy
be the better, Tyrannicall Government, or no Government at all. Though
Tyrannie (except it come to a great extremity) may be better then Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie,
yet certainly it is not better then to bring power to be regulated, though
it be with ſome trouble, That power that at firſt raiſeth power, that deſignes

Though they had no Kings,<note place="margin">Lect. 2.</note> yet if the government had been in the hand
of eminent men, of Judges over them, their condition had not beene ſo ſad.
Time was (not long before) that their happineſſe did not conſiſt in being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the government of Kings, they were in a happy condition before ever
theſe were over them, and the firſt time that ever they came under their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
it was upon their own choice: and ſo as God profeſſeth they had
rejected him, and God ſent them their firſt King in his wrath. Therefore
their miſery certainly did not depend wholly upon being without a King.</p>
               <p>If God reſtraine not Kings, they often deſire to encroach upon the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that the Laws of the Land, the light of Nature, and God himſelfe gives
Subjects. <hi>Plutarch</hi> tells us a ſtory of <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> who comming to Athens, the
Athenians to ſhew their reſpect, and to give honour to King <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> let
him come into their Caſtle, to ſacrifice there, to <hi>Minerva,</hi> which was a
place they were not wont to let ſtrangers into. VVhen he came out of the
Caſtle, he told them that he was much engaged to them for that great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour;
in requitall of which,<note place="margin">

                  </note> hee told them he would give them this good
counſell, Take heed, ſaith he, that you never let King come more into this
place; Immitating how eaſily they may be perſwaded to internch upon the
liberties of thoſe who come under their power.</p>
               <p>And this ſhould <hi>abide for many dayes.</hi> It did abide for 700. yeares and
upward before Chriſts time in regard of the ten Tribes, for from the ſixt of
<hi>Hezekiab</hi> to Chriſt it was ſo long, the tenne Tribes never came under any
Governour of their owne in all that time: And ſince Chriſts time neither
<hi>Judah</hi> nor <hi>Iſrael</hi> have had either King or Prince of their own. Oh what a
blindneſs is there upon this people! how dreadfull is that darkneſs they are
now in! That notwithſtanding the Propheſie was ſo cleare, that <hi>the ſcepter
ſhould not depart from Judah untill Shiloh came;</hi> and yet now they have
been without <hi>Prince</hi> theſe 1600. yeares, and yet they will not believe that
<hi>Shiloh</hi> is come. Thus when God giveth over to blindneſs and hardneſſe,
things that are never ſo cleare will not be believed.</p>
               <p>But their confuſion in their Church ſtate is more grievous then the other,
<hi>They ſhall be without a ſacrifice, and without an image, and without an
Ephod, and without a Teraphim.</hi> Two of theſe foure, expreſſe their being
deprived of Gods own Ordinances, and the other two their being deprived
of their falſe worſhip. They made a mixture in worſhip, they would have
their <hi>ſacrifice</hi> &amp; their <hi>Ephod,</hi> but together with them their <hi>image</hi> and their

and have the worſhip of another God mixed with it, becauſe there is not any
one of them who challengeth to himſelfe to be the univerſall good, but God
being the univerſall good, he muſt be worſhipped alone without mixture.</p>
               <p>There are two things wherein we muſt take heed of mingling;<note place="margin">2. Things in which wee muſt take heed of mixture.</note> The one
is in Divine worſhip, the other is in that great point of Juſtification. It is as

deſtroyed they could never have any. That is the reaſon that they pray with
that mighty fervency of ſpirit that God would build the Temple again, (as
I remember I formerly ſhewed you out of <hi>Buxtorfius.) Aedifica, aedifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,
aedifica; cito, cito, cito,</hi> Lord build, build, build thy Temple, in our
dayes, &amp;c. Becauſe they knew they could have no ſacrifice ſo long as their
Temple was downe; And this was a ſad condition they were in; this is
their lamentable eſtate to this day, they have not the legall ſacrifices, nor
that which was typed out by them. There were theſe three things in their
ſacrifices.</p>
               <p>1. Their tendring up of themſelves to God, the ſhewing their reſpect to
him in that way he required, that was in their Burnt-Offering.</p>
               <p>2. Seeking the expiation of ſinne, that was in their Sinne-Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:42662:264"/>
3. Seeking for mercy and thankſgiving, that was in their Peace-offering.</p>
               <p>Now to have no ſacrifice in either of theſe three kinds, that is, to have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to tender up to the high and bleſſed God to ſhew our reſpect to him;
to have no means to expiate our ſins when we have offended him; to have no
way to ſeeke to God for mercy when we need, nor to returne praiſe, this
muſt needs be a ſad thing. This the Jews have not for the preſent, we have
Chriſt who is to us all theſe, the tendring up of him. to God, is the tendring
the greateſt reſpect to God that poſſibly can be, the tendring of him is the
expiation for our ſins, it is the ſeeking of whatſoever mercy we would have,
and it is our Euchariſticall ſacrifice too for all our mercies.<note place="margin">The evill condition of thoſe who are out of Chriſt.</note> But thoſe who
are without Chriſt, are to this day without ſacrifice, they have nothing to
tender up to God. If thou wilt tender up thy eſtate, thy body, or thy liberty,
or thy name, this is no ſacrifice acceptable unto God, except thou haſt Chriſt
to tender up to him, and canſt tender up all in him and through him, then
indeed God accepts of theſe. When thou haſt ſinned what ſacrifice wilt thou
offer to God to explate thy ſin? all thy prayers, thy teares are nothing, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
they come with this ſacrifice, Jeſus Chriſt; in him indeed a contrite
heart is a ſacrifice very acceptable to God. But ſo long as thou art without
Chriſt, the judgement of the Iews is upon thee, thou art without a ſacrifice.</p>
               <p>And without an Ephod.]</p>
               <p>By this he meaneth, firſt, that they ſhould be without the Prieſthood. They
ſhould not have any Church Officers, And ſecondly, they ſhould have no
meanes to know the mind of God. That is the ſcope, which appeares thus.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That by the <hi>Ephod</hi> is meant the Prieſts, is cleare by that expreſſion
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22. 18. where it is ſaid that <hi>Doeg ſlew four-ſcore &amp; five perſons that
did we are a limen Ephod,</hi> that is, four-ſcore and five Prieſts.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Without the meanes of knowing Gods minde, for the <hi>Vrim</hi>
and the <hi>Thummim,</hi> was upon the pectorall, upon the breaſt-plate thas was
faſtned upon the <hi>Ephod;</hi> So that when they were without the <hi>Ephod,</hi> they
muſt needs be without their <hi>breaſt-plate,</hi> for the <hi>breaſt-plate</hi> was annexed
to the <hi>Ephod,</hi> and could not be uſed for the knowing the minde of God but
onely by applying it to the <hi>Ephod, 1 Sam. 30. 7. David ſaid to the Priest,
Bring me hither the Ephod, and David inquired at the Lord, ſaying, ſhall
I purſue after this troope?</hi> It was by the preſence of the <hi>Ephod,</hi> that he did
enquire vvhat the minde of God was what he ſhould do in this buſineſſe that
he was now about, whether he ſhould follow the troope, yea or no. And the
Text is very obſervable in the ſixt verſe, you may ſee at what time it was
that <hi>David</hi> was ſo carefull to make uſe of the <hi>Ephod,</hi> to know the minde of
God what he ſhould doe, he was in an exceeding diſtreſſed condition, for
<hi>Ziglag</hi> his owne City that he had the charge of was burnt, and the men of
the City were all in a fretting mood, and talked of ſtoning him, becauſe the
<hi>Amalekites</hi> had come in his abſence &amp; taken away their goods, their wives
and children, and burnt the Towne.</p>

This is the condition of men in publique places, if any thing fall out unſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
the people are ready in rage to fall upon them; this makes men in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke
places to be in a hard condition, very dangerous and troubleſome. We
had need pray much for them, we are ready to envy thoſe that are above us,
&amp; employed in publique ſervices; but conſidering what danger they are in, &amp;
how every thing that falleth out amiſſe, otherwiſe then we deſire, the blame
is preſently laid upon them, their condition is not ſo happy as we imagine.
This was <hi>Davids</hi> condition, nay the Text ſaith, that being in this <hi>condition,</hi>
he and the men that were with him wept, ſo as they had no more power to
weep their hearts were ſo broken, yet in this ſad and grievous condition, he
encourageth himſelf in the Lord his God,<note place="margin">God is ſought in ſtraits.</note> and he calleth for the Ephod to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
and know the mind of God what he ſhould do in it. You ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
that this is the firſt time we read that <hi>David</hi> in his VVars and Battells
called for the <hi>Ephod,</hi> when he went to <hi>Achiſh,</hi> then he did not enquire, when
he invaded the <hi>Geſhurites,</hi> and <hi>Amalekites</hi> before, he did not enquire, but
now when he was brought into ſtraits, when his heart was broken, when he
was in a weeping condition, now he calleth for the <hi>Ephod:</hi> VVhen God
brings men into ſtraits, and humbles them, then they will enquire of God to
purpoſe. VVe are now about to enquire of God, to know his mind but we
are not humbled enough, our ſtraits have not broken our hearts, and perhaps
we ſhall not ſo readily know Gods mind, God may yet humble us more,
and then when we come to enquire Gods mind, it may be to further pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>

                  </note> The word <hi>Ephod</hi> is that Hebrew word,
which ſignifies to cloſe in, and to compaſſe about, to gird about, becauſe of
the fitting garment to the Prieſts, and the girding of it about them. There
were divers ſorts of theſe <hi>Ephods,</hi> one peculiar to the high Prieſt, that you

the faſhion of our <hi>Ephod,</hi> but ſome little kind of reſemblance to it, they
wear it upon their heads, and ſo downward. VVhen <hi>Alexander</hi> came to
<hi>Jeruſalem, I addus</hi> the high <hi>Prieſt</hi> came with all his <hi>Prieſtly garments</hi> to

out of <hi>reverence</hi> to him; <hi>Ioſephus</hi> tels us in that ſtory, that the people came
with white <hi>garments, garments</hi> that had ſome kind of <hi>reſemblance</hi> to this <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phod:
Ioſephus</hi> ſaith that this <hi>Ephod</hi> was a garment but of a cubite long, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
covering the ſhoulders and the breaſt, open above and on either ſide, and
girt about the breaſts; others make it a longrobe, reaching down to the very
feet, But there was a <hi>robe</hi> beſide the <hi>Ephod,</hi> the <hi>Ephod</hi> was over another <hi>robe</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:42662:265"/>
ſo Chriſt appeared unto <hi>John, Rev. 1. 13. Cloathed with a garment downe
to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle,</hi> like the Prieſts, for
ſo they were wont to be arrayed; And <hi>Revel.</hi> 15. 6. the Miniſters of the

muſt be about their hearts; if their owne plottings and ſelf-ends ſhall gird
them, that is, put them on to a readineſs to do what may ſerve for thoſe ends;
this girdle is not the golden girdle, but like that <hi>rotten girdle of Jeremiahs,
Chap.</hi> 31. 7. that was profitable for nothing.</p>
               <p>This <hi>garment</hi> of the <hi>Ephod</hi> was a holy <hi>garment</hi> then, and others muſt take
heed of medling with ſuch <hi>garments,</hi> or of ſeeking to imitate to make the

great victory over the <hi>Midianites,</hi> he would imitate this <hi>Ephod,</hi> of the ſpoil
he had gotten of the <hi>Midianites,</hi> he made a rich and glorious <hi>Ephod,</hi> but the

in <hi>garments</hi> or the like, and to preſerve them amongſt people,
though it be with never ſo good an intention, their good intention will not

               <p>Firſt, Let the <hi>Tribes</hi> be what they will be in themſelves, though never ſo

                  <pb facs="tcp:42662:265"/>
preſenting all the Churches that ſhould be unto the end of the world. When
God remembers his Church, it is thorow Chriſt; God never remembers
his Church, but it is by Chriſt carrying it before him, that is the comfort of
the Saints; therefore he can never remember them to revenge himſelf upon
them, for he never thinketh of them but only as Chriſt preſenteth them unto
him.</p>
               <p>And further, A memoriall (ſay the Jewes) not onely becauſe the Prieſts
were to beare the names of the twelve Tribes ingraven in thoſe ſtones for a
memoriall before the Lord, but to ſignifie that the Prieſts themſelves were
to remember to pray for the Tribes.</p>
               <p>And thirdly, A memoriall to ſignifie that both the Prieſts and all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
were to remember their godly Anceſtors and Predeceſſors, and to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
their vertues, and not to be any diſhonour unto them.</p>
               <p>But the firſt is the chiefe, theſe precious ſtones with the names of the tribes
were firſt upon the ſhoulder, and then upon the heart: upon the ſhoulder,
this notes that Chriſt carryes his Church upon his ſhoulder, hee beares the
burthen of his Church, all their weight, all their afflictions upon his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
the ſhoulder of Chriſt ſtandeth under the Churcher, certainly therefore
they ſhall never ſinke.</p>
               <p>But may they not be ſo burthenſome to Chriſt as that he may ſhake off
his burthen? No, therefore he hath them upon his breaſt-plate too as well as
upon his ſhoulder, there was upon the breaſt-plate in the middeſt of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phod
the names of the twelve Tribes, Chriſt carryes the memoriall of his
Churches at his heart as well as upon his ſhoulders, &amp; that makes Chriſt put
his ſhoulders to the good of the Churches becauſe they are ſo neare his heart.
An infinite comfort it is in the ſpirituall meaning of this Ephod that belongs
to all the godly, Chriſt night and day hath thee upon his ſhoulder, and upon
his heart as a precious ſtone before God the Father. This one thing further
is obſervable about it, you ſhall finde if you reade that place in Exodus, that
the names of the twelve Tribes were to be ingraven upon theſe ſtones in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
according to their birth, now in <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. the twelve Apoſtles who in
regard of their Doctrine are made the twelve precious ſtones of the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the new Jeruſalem, you ſhal reade that they are all the very ſame pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
ſtones by name excepting four, and thoſe foure I finde that Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
think to be the ſame that the other were, only with different names, for
precious ſtones either in regard of the places where they are found, or in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of their quality or colour carry divers names, ſo that it is very probable
that thoſe precious ſtones in <hi>Rev.</hi> were the ſame with theſe in <hi>Exo.</hi> but there
we do not finde that they are ſet according unto any dignity of one Apoſtle
before another, as they were in the ſetting of the names of the Tribes, for the
firſt precious ſtone that was to be ſet of the foundation of the new Ieruſalem,
of the glorious Church that ſhould be, it is the ſtone of <hi>Benjamin</hi> who was the
youngeſt; And if there might be any myſtery in it, we may think it ſignifies
thus much, at leaſt we may make uſe of it by way of alluſion, that the Lord wil
<pb facs="tcp:42662:266"/>
uſe of the young ones of this generation, who ſhal make way for the new <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi>
before any of the other tribes; God will cull out them to the firſt
ſtone of the foundation of that glorious Church. In that we find there was not
ſuch order ſet of the Apoſtles as was of the Tribes, we are taught that Chriſt
would not have us look upon the Apoſtles as one above another; therefore
you ſhall find the Apoſtles are never named in one and the ſame order; in
one Evangeliſt they are ſet down in one order, and in another, in another, as
<hi>Mat. 10. Mar. 3. Luc.</hi> 9. ſo <hi>Act.</hi> 1. In all theſe they are named in a
different order, noting thereby that there is no ſuperiority nor inferiority in
the Miniſters of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Upon the <hi>Ephod</hi> there was likewiſe the <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim.</hi> It is very
hard to tell you what this <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> was, it coſts a great deal of
time to find out what men think it was, and if I ſhould tell you the variety of
the gueſſes of men about this, it would be tireſome unto you and me. <hi>Auſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in</hi>
in his 117. queſtion upon <hi>Exod. In venire quid ſint deficile,</hi> what this <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim</hi>
and <hi>Thummim</hi> was, it is hard to find, and <hi>Cajetan</hi> ſaith, none ever yet
explained what it was, and they tell us that even the Rabbins themſelves ſay,
the Jewes were very ignorant of this.<note place="margin">Faeten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bini ſum mam eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe apud Hebraeos harum rerum ignoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam.</note> But moſt probable one of theſe two,
eſpecially the latter. Some think that they were ſome ſtones ſet in the breaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate,
which by their brightneſs or darkneſſe did give an anſwer to what they
demanded of God, that is thus; when the high Prieſt went to demand of
God what was to be done in any great and publique affairs, hee preſented
this breaſt-plate with theſe ſtones before the Lord, and if God would give
an affirmative anſwer, the ſtones gave a more then ordinary brightneſs and
luſtre; but if he would give a negative anſwer, then the ſtones were darker
then they were before; but we are not certain of this, we may rather conclude
upon the other, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> (though we know not
what matter they were made of, no more then we know what Manna was
made of) it was ſomwhat that God gave <hi>Moſes</hi> to put into the breaſt-plate,
which by him was appointed as an ordinance which was to be preſented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord by the Prieſt when they would know the mind of God, &amp; when
this was preſented before the Lord, God did then uſually give an anſwer to
the Prieſt, either by an audible voyce, or by ſecret inſpiration, yet not always
tying himſelf to give it thus; for we find in Scripture, ſomtimes God did not
give an anſwer when he was ſought by <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> as when <hi>Saul</hi>
enquired of God by <hi>Vrim</hi> &amp; <hi>Thumim</hi> there was no anſwer from God; and
it is like <hi>Joſiah</hi> would not have ſent onely to <hi>Huldah</hi> the propheteſſe if hee
could have had anſwer by <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thumim;</hi> but when God pleaſed he
would give an anſwer this way.</p>
               <p>The word <hi>Vrim</hi> &amp; <hi>Thummim</hi> ſignifies <hi>light</hi> and <hi>perfection,</hi> ſome would
make it to ſignifie the <hi>knowledg</hi> and <hi>integrity</hi> of life that is to be in Miniſters,
but I rather think the meaning is, that they were bright precious ſtones which
were of a great perfection, and fit to doe that which God did appoint them
for. The <hi>Septuagint</hi> calls this <gap reason="foreign">

Now this muſt be upon the breaſt-plate of the Prieſt, which the Prieſt
making uſe of, thereby the people came to know the minde of God. This
was to ſignifie that we muſt look for the mind of God by Chriſt.<note place="margin">we muſt know Gods mind by Chriſt.</note> It is Chriſt
who is come from the Father to reveale his counſels to us; if we look to have
the mind of God any other way but through him, we are miſtaken. And
further, this <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> this breaſt-plate of judgment, was to be
upon the heart of the high Prieſt, and that when he went in before the Lord,
as <hi>Exod.</hi> 28, 30. There are two notable morall obſervations to be obſerved
from thence.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Obſ.</note> The anſwer that any Miniſter of God in the name of Chriſt ſhould
give his people, ſhould be ſuch an anſwer as ſhould lie at his very heart, hee
muſt ſpeak nothing but his very heart unto them; when he would anſwer any

muſt lie at his heart.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> It muſt be as in the preſence of the Lord, it muſt be as before
God, he muſt conſider in whoſe place he ſtandeth to anſwer as from God,
from the great Prophet of the Church.</p>
               <p>It is a great judgment threatned to be without <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it was of ſo great uſe to them. And this ſhould be for <hi>many dayes. Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus</hi>
ſaith, that they were without this two hundred years before he wrote
his <hi>Antiquities,</hi> that was an hundred and five years before Chriſt; but it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
that they had no <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> long before that time, for at
their return from captivity, <hi>Ezra 2. 63. the Tirſhatha,</hi> that is, the Ruler,
ſaid unto them, that <hi>they ſhould not eate of the moſt holy things till there
ſtood up a Prieſt with Vrim and Thummim,</hi> therefore they had not then a
Prieſt with Urim and Thummim, they expected to have one, but whether e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
they had one after it is not know. This was the reaſon of that complaint of
<hi>Aſaph, Pſa. 74. 9. We ſee not our ſignes, there is no more any Prophet, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is there any among us that knoweth how long;</hi> that is a grievous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint.
Now it is like that Pſalme was made about the very time of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
from captivity; for <hi>Ezra 2. 41. Aſaph</hi> is named among thoſe that
came to Jeruſalem from the captivity, <hi>The ſingers, the children of Aſaph,
an hundred twenty and eight.</hi> But let it be then or after, by this Pſalme wee
may finde that it was a very lamentable complaint to be without Urim and
Thummim.</p>
               <p>The reſult of all is,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> that it is a grievous thing to the Saints, that in the time
of their ſtrait they dono<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

his people into ſtraits, yet if they can know the mind of their God, they are
refreſhed and encouraged; but when they ſhall ſeeke to know Gods minde,
and the Lord reſuſeth to diſcover it to them, this is a ſad condition indeed.</p>
               <p>I find one note more of <hi>Jeroms</hi> about their being without an Ephod. We
may obſerve, ſaith he, the hardneſs of the hearts of the Jews, that they ſhould
be ſo many hundred years without ſacrifice and without Ephod, without
the true worſhip of God among them, and ways to know Gods mind, and

yet they are not guilty of any greater ſin then the ſin of Idolatry, except it be
of the killing of JESUS CHRIST,
that they ſhould not reaſon thus,<note place="margin">Quae ſit cauſa tam grandis offenſa ut tanto tempore relicti ſunt? maxime cum idolae non colant praeter interfectionem ſalvatoris, aliam non valent invenire. <hi>Hieron. in loc.</hi>

it that thus provokes God againſt us more

conſtellation of ſome ſtar, and ſo enquiring
to know ſomething that was to come, by it
the devill was uſed to anſwer, and to tell them of ſuch things as were to come;
it was an oracle of the devil that told them what ſucceſſe they ſhould have in
this or the other buſineſſe; ſometimes it hit right. See the ſuperſtition of the
Jewes; they deſired much to know the minde of God, now becauſe they
were afraid they ſhould not know all by the <hi>Ephod,</hi> which was the ordinance
of God, they would joyne with the <hi>Ephod,</hi> the <hi>Teraphim.</hi> From hence there
is this profitable note. It is a very great and fearfull evil for men in ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

It concerneth us much now at this day. We are about enquiring the mind
of God, that wee may know it about matters concerning the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
but more eſpecially about Religion, I ſuppoſe there is none of us but
will acknowledge that way that God hath appointed for the revealing of his
will in the Scripture; that we muſt look into the Scripture, and ſeek to know
Gods minde there; that is good, but let us not joyne <hi>Teraphim</hi> with it; then
do we joyne <hi>Teraphim,</hi> when we reſt not upon Scripture alone, but ſearch
after rules of mans deviſing, and what will ſtand with our own carnal ends.
The Lord may juſtly meet with us in wrath, if we preſume to joyne our <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphim</hi>
with his <hi>Ephod.</hi> Pray that at this day where there is ſo much ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after Gods mind, that thoſe who are employed in it, may keepe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to the <hi>Ephod,</hi> to the Scriptures, to that which is Gods Ordinance for
the revealing his minde, that they may not joyne the <hi>Teraphim,</hi> their own
fancies and inventions of men with the Scriptures; ſo long as we keepe to
that rule, we may hope to do well enough; but if the <hi>Teraphim</hi> be joyned
with the <hi>Ephod,</hi> if any thing be joyned with the Scriptures, though it may
ſeeme to be never ſo rationall, we have cauſe to feare God will leave us.</p>
               <p>We finde this word <hi>Teraphim</hi> uſed ſometime in Scripture for the image
of any man: as 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 13. when <hi>Michael</hi> took an image, and laid it in
the bed inſtead of <hi>David,</hi> the word in the Hebrew is <hi>Teraphim:</hi> ſo when
<hi>Rachel</hi> ſtole away her fathers images, the word is, ſhe ſtole away her fathers
<hi>Teraphim,</hi> and ſome thinke they were her fathers Divining Images, &amp; that
ſhe did rather ſteale thoſe then any others, becauſe ſhe would not have her
father Divine which way they were gone. <hi>Zachar.</hi> 10. 2. it is ſaid <hi>the Idols
have ſpoken vanity;</hi> the word is the <hi>Teraphim.</hi> By which we may ſee they
were wont to aske of their Idols about their ſucceſſes. And ſometime wee
find in Scripture that Idolatry is called by this name, as 1. <hi>Sam. 15. 23. ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſſe
is as Idolatry,</hi> the word is, is as <hi>Teraphim.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But here comes in the queſtion,<note place="margin">How the taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and the Tera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phim is a threatning.</note> God threatneth to take away the <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi>
and the <hi>Ephod,</hi> that plainly is a threatning, but how is this a part of the
threatning to take away the <hi>Image</hi> &amp; the <hi>Teraphim?</hi> You may underſtand
it as a threatning by this ſimilitude; It is as if God would threaten to bring
Iſrael into ſuch a deſolate condition as a ſtrumpet is brought into, not only
when all her friends leave her which were her kindred, her true friends, but
when all her lovers leave her too, even thoſe who were filthy with her, thoſe
who pretended the moſt love to her, in whom ſhe took abundance of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
and from whom ſhe expected protection; yet now ſhe is brought into
ſuch a condition, as ſhe ſitteth deſolate, for lorne and helpleſſe: So ſhall ye
be, ſaith God, your <hi>Sacrifice</hi> and your <hi>Ephod,</hi> yea and <hi>Teraphim</hi> ſhall
leave you.</p>
               <p>Or rather thus, Howſoever it is a mercy for God to take away falſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
from a people, <hi>Images</hi> and <hi>Teraphim,</hi> yet in this regard it comes in
a way of threatning, becauſe it would croſſe and vex them to bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of theſe <hi>Images</hi> and <hi>Teraphim,</hi> it would bee a Judgement in
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:42662:270"/>
their apprehenſion: As for inſtance, what a deal of ſtir have we with people,
when they conceive that any falſe worſhip ſhall be taken away from them,
they think they are undone in it; when the inventions of men in Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
are but queſtioned, what a do is there! men think their gods are taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;
as <hi>Judges</hi> 18. when the children of <hi>Dan</hi> came to the houſe of <hi>Micah,</hi>
and took away his <hi>Ephod</hi> and his <hi>Teraphim,</hi> he cryed out after them, <hi>Yee

whereas they have heretofore worſhipped God in a falſe way, after the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions

               <p>Firſt, they ſaid that their children were denyed to be baptized, as now they

grown up to the height, yet in compariſon of thoſe evill dayes that ſhall be a
little before this glorious time, theſe days may be called the golden age. God
will bring all into a Chaos firſt, as he did in the firſt <hi>Creation,</hi> &amp; then bring
a glorious building out of that Chaos. We know the raiſing of that glorious
<hi>Church</hi> that is ſo much propheſied of, is called a creation, <hi>a creating a new
heaven and a new earth;</hi> and it is probable enough, that as the <hi>heavens</hi> and
the <hi>earth</hi> were firſt made out of a <hi>Chaos,</hi> ſo thoſe new <hi>heavens</hi> and new
<hi>earth</hi> that God is about to make, will be raiſed out of a <hi>Chaos,</hi> out of that
which ſeemeth to us to be but confuſion. VVhat do people cry out of at this
day but of <hi>confuſion?</hi> all things they ſay are brought into <hi>confuſion:</hi> It is
true, <hi>confuſion</hi> is an evill thing, and we are to grieve for it, and to ſeek to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
it, yet let us not be too much troubled, for you ſee when the greateſt <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion</hi>
comes upon the people of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> then follows the greateſt mercy,
then <hi>they ſhall return and ſeeke the Lord their God,</hi> never return before that
time. Indeed till men be taken off from all, they will not return to God, if
they have any thing to go unto, they will never return to God. VVhen <hi>Saul</hi>
had but a witch to go to, he would rather go to her, then ſeek the face of God
in way of <hi>repentance.</hi> Let not this be our way, becauſe God ſeems to leave
us for the preſent, and letteth us be in a <hi>confuſion,</hi> and we know not what to
do, let not our hearts fiet and vex, let us not go to unlawful means; For mark,
it was juſt a little before <hi>Sanl</hi> was to be deſtroyed that he was growne to that
height of evill. There was a time that <hi>Saul</hi> did enquire after Gods mind, and
God refuſed to anſwer him, but yet hee would not take ſuch an unlawfull
courſe then, but he ſearched to ſee whatſin was amongſt the people that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
God to refuſe to give him an anſwer, ſo you have it in the caſe of <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi>
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 33. when he took the honey, <hi>he enquired of God, and God
anſwered not, and Saul ſaid, draw neere and ſee wherein this ſin hath beene
this day.</hi> But afterward he grew to a greate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="520" facs="tcp:42662:271"/>
not us ſay, things are now in ſuch a confuſion that we know not how to find
out the mind of God, we conſult with Miniſters and they know not what to
ſay, they have caſt out ſuch a government, and they know not what to bring
in, and therefore it were better we were as before. If this ſhould be our tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning,
it is a ſigne we are like <hi>Saul</hi> nigh to deſtruction. Let us be content to
wayte, they ſhall be <hi>many dayes without a King, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>then they ſhal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn;</hi>
this ſhall be the fruite of being without a King, and Prince<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; Ephod,
and Sacrifice, not vexing and raging, but returning to God and repenting.
It things be worſe, &amp; we be brought into greater ſtraits then ever we thought
of, let us not murmur, but let us repent. Every one is complaining, but who
is repenting? If there were as much repenting as there is murmuring, then
we ſhould ſoone know the minde of God.</p>
               <p>Then they ſhall returne.</p>
               <p>Here is the uſe of ſanctified affliction, it is to cauſe returning to God.
<hi>Jerome</hi> expreſſes the life of an impenitent ſinner by a line ſtretched out,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> he
goes ſaith he from the center in a right line, and ſo goes <hi>in infinitum</hi> from it,
but a penitent ſinner is like a line bent, and turning back to the center, though
by ſin he goes from it, yet by repentance he turnes to it again, they are gone
from me a great way ſaith God, but I will give them a turne, they ſhal bend
back again and return to me. <hi>They ſhall returne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Repentance is ſet out by this vvord,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> to note the folly of ſinne. In ſin thou
goeſt out of the way, and the truth is though you thinke you chooſe a good
way for your ſelf, yet you muſt either come back again or periſh. It is juſt
like a man travelling in a rode, and he ſees a dirty lane before him, which he
is told is the way, he muſt goe there, but on the other ſide of the hedg he ſeeth
a green and pleaſant vvay, and he gets over into that way, and ſo perhaps
rides on a mile or two, at length he is compaſt about with ditches and rivers
ſo that he muſt either return back or elſe lie there &amp; ſtarve, he returnes back,
with ſhame, and if any one that before told him of the other way ſee him, he
tells him now of his folly, I told you that the other was the way, and that if
you went over the hedge you muſt come back again: So it is with ſinners,
there are wayes of God that go directly to heaven, but becauſe thoſe wayes
are rugged, and they meet with trouble and perſecution in them, &amp; they ſee
by-ways that leade to hell that are more plaine &amp; ſmooth, they get over, they
will tranſgreſſe, (for that is the word for ſinne) they are got over, now they
are merry &amp; ſriske up and down for a while in this fine way; but friend you
muſt come backe again, and if ever you mean to be ſaved, you muſt goe in
the way that you have refuſed.<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> Further, <hi>they ſhal return and ſeeke the Lord
their God.</hi> Here is an encouragement for old ſinners. The Jews have been
above 1600. years in this wofull condition, for ſaking God, but in their latter
dayes they ſhall returne and ſeeke the Lord, and God ſhall be mercifull to
them. Haſt thou been forty, fifty, ſixty years going from God? there is hope

to the true, they ſhall return to God. It is that we had now need look unto.
We muſt not think it enough to caſt one falſe way of government out of the
Church, and turn to another, though not ſo ill yet not Gods, if out of any po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticke

               <p>
                  <hi>They ſhall ſeek Jehovah,</hi> not their Idols, but God himſelf. The word

wayes, they ſhall come and acknowledge their falſe wayes and their doings
which have not been good, and ſeek mercy for pardon.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>They ſhall ſeek the Lord,</hi> that is, they ſhall ſeeke the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip

<hi>Pſal. 105. 4. Seeke the Lord &amp; his ſtrength,</hi> what is meant by <hi>the ſtrength
of God</hi> there? It is the Arke, for that Pſalme was made at the bringing in of
the Arke into the place that <hi>David</hi> had prepared, as you may ſee by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
that <hi>Pſalme</hi> with the 1 <hi>Chron,</hi> 16. the Arke of God is called <hi>the
ſtrength of God, Pſal. 78. 61. He gave his ſtrength into captivity.</hi> Surely
if the true worſhip of God be the ſtrength of God, it is our ſtrength too, a
people are then ſtrong when they entertaine the Arke of God, the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of God, and then indeed we ſeeke God aright when we ſeeke to know
the way of his worſhip.</p>
               <p>Laſtly,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> 
                  <hi>They ſhal ſeek the Lord,</hi> that is, they ſhall ſeeke to know his will
in all their wayes, and to do it. It is not enough for them to be content to do
juſt that which ſhall be put upon them, but they ſhall ſeek to know what his
minde &amp; his worſhip is. Some yeeld thus far to God, if any come to them
and convince them that this is to be done, then they will do it, they dare not
then but yeeld to it; but when the heart is in a true repenting frame, it is then
in a ſeeking frame, it is laborious and induſtrious to know the mind of God.
Whereas the heart of a ſinner heretofore lay dead &amp; dull, never ſtirred after
God, now it is in a ſtirting, in an inquiring, in a ſeeking way, this is a ſigne
of much good: though thou haſt not what thou ſeekeſt for, yet be comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

<hi>Come</hi> (ſay they) <hi>let us joyne our ſelves to the Lord in a perpetual Covenant

world, and ſo to reſolve to obey what ſhall be revealed to be Gods mind, as
to be willing to enter into a perpetual Covenant, to binde our ſelves to yeeld

not come to get a little notional knowledge, but come with your faces to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Chriſt and his truth, before you come you ſhould get alone (if you be

God. <hi>They ſhall ſeeke the Lord their God;</hi> [their God] this hath two
references, either to what is paſt, or to what is to come. To what is paſt,
<hi>their God,</hi> that is, the God who was once the God of the Jews, the God of

<hi>their God,</hi> that is, that God that is yet ready and willing to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled

When Iſrael, theſe ten Tribes (for he ſpeakes of them eſpecially) when they
ſhall return they ſhall <hi>ſeeke the Lord,</hi> and the Meſſiah, but that they ſhall
<hi>ſeek the Lord and David?</hi> The reaſon is, the expreſſion is brought to this
end, to put theſe Tribes in minde of that great ſinne of theirs, in their defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> there was an intimation in this expresſion of
that defection they had from <hi>David,</hi> when they ſhall repent this will lye
neere their hearts, they will mourne for this their ſinne, when they chooſe
Chriſt to be their King, they ſhall do it under the name of <hi>David;</hi> As if they
ſhould ſay, we indeed have caſt off the houſe of <hi>David</hi> ſinfully, but we now
come and chooſe the Son of <hi>David</hi> to be our King. Thereby putting us in
minde of this note of inſtruction.</p>
               <p>True penitents in mourning for their ſinne and returning to God,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> will go
to the roote of their ſin as much as they can, to their firſt defection &amp; mourn
for that, and labour what lies in them to reforme in that very thing wherein
the root and beginning of their ſin lay.</p>

The fourth is, why <hi>ſeeking the Meſſiah</hi> (under what name ſoever) is here
joyned to <hi>ſeeking the Lord,</hi> the very marrow of all the Goſpel is in theſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
words, <hi>they ſhall ſeeke Jehovah, and David their King.</hi> It is added for
this end, to ſhew us, that none can ſeek God rightly but through Chriſt, they
muſt ſeek God in Chriſt; <hi>This is eternal life to know thee and thy Son,</hi> to
know God alone is not eternall life, but to know God and his Son; ſo to
ſeek God alone is not eternal life, not will it ever bring to eternal life, except
there be a ſeeking of God in Chriſt, ſeeking <hi>Jehovah</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> putting
them together. Grace from God the Father, and from Jeſus Chriſt, thoſe
muſt goe together, no grace from God the Father, but from him through
Chriſt;<note place="margin">Non ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culoſum, ſed horrt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile eſt de Deo extra Chriſtum cogitare. <hi>Luther.</hi>

of <hi>David</hi> likewiſe: it is not only dangerous, but it is a horrible thing to
think of God without Chriſt; the very thought of God not through Chriſt
is a moſt dreadfull thing to the heart of any who knows God. Indeed there
are a company who have bold preſumptuous hearts, who will go into Gods
preſence though reeking in the very guilt of their ſin lately committed, and
ſeeke to God for mercy, and never think of Chriſt the Mediator; they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand

in the life of <hi>Themyſtocles</hi> reports) of ſome of the Heathens, the Molosſians,
when they would ſeek the favour of the Prince, they tooke up the Kings Son
in their armes, and ſo went and kneeled before his Altar in his Chappell; ſo
<hi>Themyſtocles</hi> did when he ſought the favour of King <hi>Admetus.</hi> It ſhould
be the way of Chriſtians in ſeeking the face of God the great King, to take
up his Sonne in the armes of Faith. A notable ſpeech <hi>Luther</hi> hath in <hi>Pſal.</hi>
130. Often and willingly, ſaith he, doe I inculcate this, that you ſhould ſhut
your eies &amp; your eares, and ſay you know no God out of Chriſt, none but

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>call way of ſeeking God; when we have ſinned, if
there be any way of help, it muſt be by ſeeking this mercifull God; thus
farre nature goes, and moſt people goe no further, yea moſt Chriſtians,
though they have the name of Chriſt in their mouths, yet the worke of their
hearts is no further then natural principles carry them on. But the ſeeking
God in Chriſt, is the true ſupernaturall way, the Evangelicall way, that
is the myſtery of godlineſſe, to tender up a Mediator to God every time
wee come into his preſence. I feare that many of our prayers are loſt
for want of this. There is much Faſting and Prayer thorough Gods
mercy amongſt us, and I would to God there were no abating that
way; but though wee thinke, will God leave his people when there is
ſuch a ſpirit of Prayer? If it be not a ſeeking of God in his Son, know it
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:42662:274"/>
is our own ſpirits rather then the Spirit of God. VVee may be earneſt in
prayer, and cry mightily to God, yet if we take not up his Son in the armes
of faith, and tender him to the Father, thouſands of prayers and faſting days
may be all loſt for want of this. The truth is, wee muſt not depend ſo much
upon our prayers, though we are to rejoyce and to bleſſe God that there is ſo
much prayer; but Gods wayes towards us ſeeme as if hee would take us off
from means, and make us look up to free grace, not take us off from the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
of any, but from relying upon any, onely to rely upon free grace in
Chriſt. As this is the ſupernaturall ſeeking God, ſo it is the moſt powerfull
way of ſeeking him. It is not enough to ſeeke God by vertue of a promiſe,
except vve ſeek him by vertue of Chriſt, who is the foundation of all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.
VVe ſeek him becauſe he is mercifull, that is one way; yea we ſeek
him becauſe he hath promiſed mercy, this is a higher degree; but we muſt go
higher yet, we muſt look to his Son, <hi>in whom all the promiſes are Yea &amp; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;</hi>
otherwiſe, though we ſeek him never ſo earneſtly, though we chalenge
his promiſes, and cry to him to remember his promiſes, yet if we do not act
our faith upon his Son, wee may miſſe in all,</p>
               <p>And herein we ſanctifie that great name of God in that which is the great
work of his, his maſter-piece as we may ſay, or the great deſigne hee hath to
honour himſelf in the world here, and everlaſtingly hereafter. Certainely,
though God hath made the creature for his own glory, &amp; expects we ſhould
honour him in beholding him in the creature, yet the great deſign God hath
to honour himſelfe in and by, is in that glory of his that is manifeſted in his
Son, to have the children of men behold this his glory, and reflect it upon his
own face; except you give God his glory in this, he cares not much for what
ſoever glory you can give him otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>You muſt not therfore expect when you ſeek <hi>God,</hi> that you muſt have good
things from him meerly becauſe he is mercifull, you muſt not thinke that the
mercy of God ſerveth to eike out our righteouſneſſe. Perhaps ſome will ſay,
it is true, we are poor ſinfull creatures, and what can wee expect from God
being fin full? but we hope that God will pardon our ſin, and ſo will accept
of the poor ſervices that we perform; This is the way that moſt goe, they do
as it were imploy Gods mercy in ſuch a worke that God never intended it
for, that is, they would make the mercy of God to eike out their owne righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe,
and ſo both put together, they think they will ſerve to be a means
of <hi>atonement:</hi> No, you miſtake Gods mercy; the worke of Gods mercy
is not this, but it is to ſhew us our unrighteouſneſſe, our miſery, our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clearneſſe,
to ſhew us Jeſus Chriſt, to draw our hearts to him, to emptie
us of our ſelves, that wee may wholly rely upon that righteouſneſſe that is
by faith in him, and tender up that to the Father for ſanctification and <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement,</hi>
that is the work of Gods mercy; when it hath this work, then it
hath the true genuine work indeed.</p>
               <p>The fifth is, why here added <hi>King.</hi> True, wee muſt <hi>ſeeke the Lord and
Chriſt,</hi> but why Chriſt the <hi>King?</hi> The reaſon is, becauſe Chriſt in the latter
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:42662:274"/>
dayes ſhall be fully honoured in his Kingly power: they ſhall looke upon
him not only as Prophet and Prieſt, but as King. Hitherto Chriſt hath bin
much honoured in his Propheticall and Prieſtly office, but not ſo much in
his Kingly; but in the latter dayes when God ſhall call home his people (the
Jewes) then Chriſt ſhall be fully honoured in his Kingly office. The Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle
of Chriſt was raiſed in the Primitive times, according to that ſpeech
of St. <hi>James</hi> we had before, <hi>Acts 15. 16. God ſhall raiſe the tabernacle of
David,</hi> hee puts it as fulfilled then; but there is a time when God ſhall not
only raife the tabernacle of <hi>David,</hi> but the throne of <hi>David;</hi> Chriſt the
King ſhall appeare in glory. <hi>Ezek. 37, 24, 25. And David my ſervant
ſhall be King over them.</hi> It was ſpoken upon the union that there ſhould be
between Judah and Iſrael, then <hi>David my ſervant ſhall be King over them.
David</hi> was dead a great while before, there is a time that <hi>David</hi> muſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
be King, that is, Chriſt, upon the union of all the Tribes together; And
againe, <hi>David ſhall be Prince for ever,</hi> when they are brought againe into
their owne land, <hi>David ſhall be Prince over them for ever,</hi> ſaith the Text:
ſurely this propheſie is yet to be fulfilled. And <hi>Luke 1. 32. The Lord ſhall
give him the throne of his father David, and he ſhall reign over the houſe of
Jacob for ever, and of his kingdome there ſhall be no end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know we uſually think that this is meant only of his ſpirituall reign, but
there is a miſtake in it, certainly there is to be a fulfilling of this propheſie in
a reign that ſhall outwardly appeare before the children of men, which will
appea more in comparing this with other Scriptures. <hi>Revel. 11. 15. The
kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of the Lord &amp; his Chriſt,
and ſo he ſhall reign for ever and ever.</hi> VVhy in a ſpirituall ſenſe the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
of this world are always the kingdomes of the Lord and of Chriſt, but
there is ſpoken of ſome famous notable time when the kingdomes of this
world ſhall appeare to be the Lord, and his Chriſts, and then he ſhall reigne
for ever and ever, after another manner then now he doth. <hi>Revel. 3. 21. To
him that overcometh will I give to ſit with me in my throne, as I alſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came,
and am ſet down with my Father in his throne.</hi> Mark this Text, as
one of the moſt notable of any wee have.</p>
               <p>That kingly rule that Chriſt hath for the preſent is upon his Fathers throne;
he is not yet upon his own in compariſon of what he ſhall be, the kingdome
that Chriſt hath now is the joynt reigne of him with the Father, but there is a
time for Chriſt to have a Throne himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Now that Throne of Chriſt it may be you will thinke it is in heaven at the
day of judgement; but we finde 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 24. that at that day he comes to
refigne the kingdome, the words do not ſeeme to import as if hee came to
take it, but that then hee doth <hi>give up the kingdome unto God the Father,</hi>
therefore there is a time for Chriſt himſelf to have a Throne, with whom the
Saints shall reign. <hi>Matth. 21. 9. The children cryed out Hoſanna to the
ſonne of David,</hi> becauſe they looked upon the ſonne of <hi>David</hi> as one who
was to reign.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="528" facs="tcp:42662:275"/>
In theſe latter dayes CHRIST ſhall breake the Kings of the earth
who ſtand againſt him, as indeed many, yea moſt of the Kings of the earth
have ever ſtood out to hinder this kingdome of his. There will be a mighty
ſhaking of the kingdoms of the earth when this ſhall be, <hi>Heb. 12. 26. Whoſe

               <p>Firſt, <hi>David</hi> of all the Princes that ever were was one of the moſt gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,

David</hi> and CHRIST are parallel, <hi>Pſal. 78. 70. 71. He choſe David
his ſervant, &amp; tooke him from the ſheep-folds, from following the ewes great

So the Kingdome of Chriſt, <hi>Eſay</hi> 40. having ſpoken <hi>ver.</hi> 9. of the

               <p>Secondly, <hi>David their King,</hi> in regard of faithfulneſſe. <hi>David</hi> was
exceeding faithfull to his people, and therefore the mercies of God in Chriſt

               <p>This is a bleſſed thing when we may confide and fully venture our eſtates,
liberties and our lives upon the promiſes of thoſe who are above us. VVe
know how many there are about great perſonages to take them off from
thoſe things that they have promiſed, though never ſo ſeriouſly, and with
never ſuch ſolemne proteſtations to performe them. I will give you a ſtory
or two remarkable for this, to ſhew what danger people have been in when
they have confided upon the promiſes of Princes, when there have beene
thoſe about them that endeavoured to take of their hearts from performing
what they had ingaged themſelves to.</p>
               <p>You ſhall finde in the life of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth this ſtory; The King ſends
his Letters to London in the behalfe of the Duke of Somerſet the then Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector;
there were divers of the Lords roſe up againſt him, thinking he did
oppreſſe the people, and they ſent the ſame time their Letters to London for
their aide and aſſiſtance; hereupon there was a Common Counſell called
in the City, and amongſt them there was one that the ſtory ſaith was a wiſe
and an honeſt man, one <hi>George Stadlowe,</hi> and he ſpeakes thus to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell,
I remember, ſaith he, a ſtory written in <hi>Fabians</hi> Chronicle, of the wars
between <hi>Henry</hi> the third and his Barons, at which time the Baronsdeman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
aide of the City of London, as our Lords do now, and that in a rightfull
cauſe, for the good of the Common-wealth, for the execution of divers
good lawes againſt the King, who would not ſuffer thoſe lawes to be put in
execution, and the City did aide them, and it came unto an open bartell,
and the Lords prevailed againſt the King and tooke the King and his ſonne
priſoners, and upon certaine conditions the Lords reſtored the King &amp; his
ſon again to their liberties, amongſt other conditions this was one, that the
King ſhould not only grant his pardon to the Lords, but alſo to the Citizens
of London, which was granted, and the condition of their accommodation

of it? was it forgotten? no ſurely, nor forgiven neither, during the
Kingslife, the libeties of the Cities were taken away, ſtrangers were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to be our head &amp; governours, the Citizens, their bodies and goods were
given away, and ſo from one perſecution to another they were moſt miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
afflicted. Again, in the hiſtory of Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time we find, that
Qeene <hi>Mary,</hi> becauſe there was ſome diſpute about her comming to the
Crowne, at that time ſhe went down into Suffolke, to the place where the
Duke that then roſe up for another was moſt hated, and ſhe being at Fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham
Caſtle the Suffolke men came to her, and promiſed their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ide, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
condition that ſhe would not attemp the alteration of Religion, which
her brother King <hi>Edward</hi> before had eſtabliſhed; ſhe promiſed them there
ſhould be no innovation of Religion, no God forbid, yea ſhe ſo promiſed
that the ſtory ſaith, no man would or could miſdoubt of the performance:
But afterward when ſhe came to get the power in her hand, the Suffolk men
came to make ſupplication to her, that ſhe would be pleaſed to performe the
promiſe ſhe made them, ſhe anſwered them thus, Foraſmuch as you being
but members deſire to rule your head, you ſhall one day well perceive that
members muſt obey their head, and not looke to beare rule over the ſame;
And not only ſo, but to cauſe the more terrour, a Gentleman one Maſter
<hi>Dobs</hi> that lived about Windſor, who did but in an humble requeſt advertiſe
her of her promiſe made to the Suffolke men, he was three times ſet on the
Pillory, and others for the ſame cauſe were ſent to priſon. We may ſee what
hold hath been heretofore in the promiſes of thoſe who had power to breake
them, you know what temptations they have to withdraw their hearts from
what they have ingaged themſelves unto. But when this our Prince comes,
<hi>David</hi> our King we ſhall finde the ſure mercies of <hi>David,</hi> we ſhall finde
nothing but faithfulneſſe in all his dealings.</p>

I ſhall ſpeake of the feare of God here onely as it concerns this place, the
intent of bringing it in here, that is to ſhew that in the time when this glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Church ſhall be, when God ſhall call home his own people the Jewes,
and bring in the fulneſſe of the Gentiles, then ſhall the feare of God mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prevayle upon the hearts of people more then ever, and the greater Gods
goodneſſe ſhall be, the more ſhall the feare of God be upon their hearts, this
we ſhall finde almoſt in all the Propheſies of the glorious condition of the
Church (which is very remarkable) there is ever ſpeaking of the feare of
God that ſhould be upon the hearts of people. One would rather thinke
there ſhould be ſpeaking of the joy that they ſhould have, that there ſhould
be nothing but mirth and triumph in thoſe times; but the Scripture ſpeakes
exceeding much of feare that ſhall be then, and more then, then at any other
time. Thus <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. 18. a moſt famous Propheſie of Chriſts comming,
and taking the kingdomes of the earth,<note place="margin">The fear of God wil be moſt ſtrong when the Church shall bee moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</note> and bringing his reward with him,
<hi>he ſhall come and give a reward to thoſe that feare him.</hi> And Revel. 14. 7.
<hi>I ſaw an Angel flee in the middeſt of heaven having the everlaſting Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel

<hi>the verlaſting Goſpel,</hi> how doth he preach it? what, now caſt away fear and

There is the ſong of the Saints when they are delivered from the power of

               <p>Upon theſe foure grounds,</p>

ſhall behold their King in that glory that ſhal cauſe fear, <hi>Rev,</hi> 19. 12. Chriſt
is deſcribed with his <hi>eyes as flames of fire, and on his head many Crownes,
cloathed with a veſture dipt in blood, at wo-edged ſword out of his month,
and on his veſture and on his thigh written, King of Kings, and Lord of
Lords.</hi> Thus they ſhall behold Chriſt, and therefore they ſhall feare.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in thoſe times the feare of God will much prevaile in the hearts
of people, becauſe of the great workes of God that ſhal be then, <hi>the heavens
ſhall depart like a ſcrole, and the elements melt with fervent heate.</hi> This
is meant of the time when there ſhal be <hi>new heavens &amp; a new earth,</hi> which

not the earth onely, but alſo heaven.</hi> There ſhall be wonderfull workes of
God in the earth when thoſe dayes come, therefore there ſhall be much of
the feare of God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Much of the feare of God then, becauſe of the holineſs of the
worſhip of God and of his Ordinances, the purity of them ſhall cauſe fear:</p>
               <p>Did we ſee the Ordinances in the true and native purity and holineſſe of
them, it would ſtrike much feare in us. Some have but ſeene the execution
of that one Ordinance of Excommunication in a ſolemn gracious way, and
it hath daunted their hearts, it hath ſtruke feare in a moſt proud, profane,
ſtubborn, wicked heart, the beholding then of all the Ordinances, and all
duties of worſhip in their true native purity, holineſs and glory, cannot but
cauſe much feare, <hi>Pſal. 68. 35. O God thou art terrible out of thy holy pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;</hi>
God will be terrible out of his holy places and out of all his holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Much feare there will be at that day, becauſe of the holineſs of
the Saints, there ſhall be ſo much holineſs that ſhall appeare bright in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
faces and converſations of the Saints that ſhal ſtrike great feare. <hi>Holy &amp;

the Saints in that day, their graces ſhall be much raiſed, they ſhall ſparkle
with abundance of the graces of Gods Spirit in them; their wiſdome &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
ſhall make their faces ſhine, holy and reverent shall be their names,
<hi>Pſal. 89. 7. God is greatly to be feared in the aſſembly of the Saints,</hi> thoſe
Saints of his who walke cloſe with him, have a daunting power in their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.
I appeale to guilty conſciences, to apoſtates, to profeſſors who
have ſecret haunts of wickedneſs, ſometime when you come but into the
preſence of one who is a truly gracious godly man or woman, whom your
conſcience tels you walkes cloſe with God, doth not even the very ſight of
ſuch a one terrifie you? the very luſtre of that holineſs you ſee in ſuch a one
ſtrikes upon your conſcience, then you thinke ſuch an one walkes cloſe with
God indeed, but I have baſely forſaken the Lord, and have had ſuch a haunt
of wickedneſſe, I have brought dreadfull guilt upon my ſoul ſince I ſaw him
laſt. Eccleſiaſticall ſtories tell us of <hi>Baſil,</hi> when the officers came to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend

&amp; luſtre came from his countenance, that the officers fell down back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
(as they did who came to apprehend Chriſt) they were not able to lay

one of them ſhall have their hearts filled with holineſſe, it will cauſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of fear even in all the hearts of thoſe that converſe with them.</p>
               <p>But wicked ones ſhall feare too as well as the Saints. <hi>Luke 21. 26. Mens
hearts ſhall faile them for feare,</hi> it ſhal be true in theſe dayes as it was in the
deſtruction of Jeruſalem.</p>
               <p>The Saints shall <hi>feare the Lord and his goodneſs;</hi>

               <p>You will ſay, what <hi>goodneſſe?</hi> what shall that goodneſs of God be that

               <p>I will tell you briefly, I need not ſpend much time in it, for I have ſpent
a whole Sermon about it when I ſpake of the laſt words of the firſt Chapter
of this Propheſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

people as we are, and pardon all our ſins! What Iſrael, the ten Tribes,
who had moſt wretchedly forſaken God, who had crucified Jeſus Chriſt,
crucified <hi>David</hi> their King, yet that blood they have ſhed is applyed to them

God, and him that feareth him not. Then ſhall God take away all
the reproach of his Saints. What bitter reproach hath been upon the Saints
ſince the beginning of the world, eſpecially ſince the times of the Goſpel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Reproach, firſt becauſe they are meane people, of the lower ſort. 2. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
becauſe they ſuffer much, and God lets his adverſaries prevaile over
them. 3 Reproach, becauſe they waite upon God, and God ſeems not to
come,<note place="margin">God will take away the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of his Saints.</note> the adverſaries ſay, where is your God? No marvaile you pray and
Faſt, what is become of all? Here will be the goodneſs of God at that day
to wipe off all this reproach. They ſhall have ſo much mercy, ſo much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
from God, that it ſhall appeare before all the world that it was good to
waite upon him, ſo much as ſhall countervaile abundantly all their ſufferings,
they ſhall bleſſe God that ever it was put into their hearts to ſuffer for him, to
waite upon him. And becauſe God foreſeeth this, what goodneſs he hath
laid up for his people, that they ſhall enjoy ere long, (and we know a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
years with him are as one day) that is the reaſon why he ſuffereth his
people to be ſo under for the preſent, he knows he hath that goodneſs for
them hereafter, yea in this world, that all the world ſhal ſay that God hath
dealt well with them, that he was not a hard Maſter to them to make them
waite ſo long, and to let them ſuffer ſo much as they do. I will give you for
this one excellent Scripture, perhaps you have not conſidered of the empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis
of the argument that is in it. It is <hi>Heb, 11. 16. They deſired a better
Countrey. that is, an heavenly; wherefore God is not aſhamed to be called
their God, for he hath prepared for them a City.</hi> The poor perſecuted Saints
wandred up &amp; down, they were content to leave their own Country, their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates
here, and ſought another Country, an heavenly, but they had it not,
their enemies prevailed over them, as if God had forſaken them; but <hi>God
is not aſhamed to be called their God,</hi> what is the argument?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="534" facs="tcp:42662:278"/>
                  <hi>For he hath prepared for them a City;</hi> Marke the force of the argument,
<hi>for he hath prepared for them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> City:</hi> This City is this text I am now ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of; ſometimes it is deſcribed as a <hi>Tabernacle, The Tabernacle of God

ſometime a <hi>Kingdome,</hi> ſometime an <hi>Inheritance.</hi> Here <hi>God hath prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for them a City:</hi> that is, there is a glorious time for Gods people, when
they shall have the new Jeruſalem come down from heaven unto them.</p>
               <p>Now then, ſaith God, though my people be in a ſuffering condition, I
am not aſhamed to be called their God. I am not aſhamed to own this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
for I have glory enough for them, as if God ſhould be aſhamed that he
ſhould ever profeſſe ſuch an intereſt in his people, and this people profeſſe
ſuch an intereſt in him, if there were nothing to come for them, if there
were not a time to recompence all their ſuffering. As if a Maſter ſhould own
a ſervant, or a Prince a ſubject, if this ſervant or ſubject ſuffer extreamely,
and hath no help, but ſtill when he expects help, there comes none, and when
he thinketh, ſurely now it will come, ſtill it fayls him; yet if you know that
at ſuch a day you ſhall recompence all this, you ſhall advance him and bring
him to ſuch honour that he will bleſſe God that ever he was in your ſervice;
you will not be aſhamed to owne this ſervant: But if this ſervant ſhall ſuffer
in your cauſe, and you have no time, nor no ability to recompence him, but
he muſt ſuffer and ſuffer for ever, it would be a ſhame to you to owne him.
So God is pleaſed to ſpeake here, becauſe I have prepared for them ſuch a
City, though they be in preſent perſecution, I am not aſhamed to own them
for my people, and I doe not account it any diſhonour to me, for there is a
time coming that will anſwer all objections whatſoever. This is the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of God.</p>
               <p>They ſhall feare his goodneſſe. <hi>Feare it, how?</hi>

               <p>In theſe ſeverall regards.<note place="margin">How the goodneſſe of God is to be feared.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, They ſhall admire at his goodneſſe, and in their admirations even
ſtand amazed at it, the feare of amazement. 2 <hi>Theſ. 1. 10. When Chriſt ſhall
come,</hi> he ſhall come <hi>to be admired of his Saints; Luke</hi> 5. 26. The text ſaith
they were <hi>all amazed, and glorified God, and were filled with feare, ſaying,
We have ſeene ſtrange things to day.</hi> VVhen this goodneſſe of God ſhall
come, all the Saints ſhall ſtand admiring it with amazement, &amp; ſay one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
another, we did heretofore heare of Propheſies and promiſes, and we
thought when they were opened to us, our hearts did burn within us, O they
were bleſſed things! but now here is goodneſs we never thought of, this is
higher and more glorious then ever we imagined. Thus <hi>they ſhall feare
the Lord &amp; his goodneſs.</hi> You have ſuch a place <hi>Jer. 23. 9. It ſhal be to me
a name of joy, apraiſe, and an honour before all the Nations of the earth,</hi> &amp;
<hi>When people ſhal heare of all the good that I do unto them, they ſhal fear &amp;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> tremble for all the goodnes, &amp; for all the proſperity that I procure unto it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Feare this goodneſs; they shall upon this fall down and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
this God with feare: Oh how ſhall their hearts adore this God; becauſe
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:42662:278"/>
of this his goodneſſe! As we reade of <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 34. 8. God had told
him that <hi>he would make all his goodneſſe paſſe before him;</hi> now when God
came and paſſed by before him, and proclaimed his goodneſs, <hi>The Lord,
the Lord God; mercifull and gracious, long-ſuffering, and abundant in
goodneſſe and truth, keeping mercy for thouſands, forgiving iniquity, and
tranſgreſſion, and ſinne;</hi> The Text ſaith, <hi>When Moſes heard this, he made
haſte, and bowed his head and worſhipped before the Lord.</hi> There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
will cauſe a gracious heart to make more haſte to worship God then
the beholding the glory and luſtre of Gods grace and goodneſſe: then the
heart will not ſtand dallying and triffling any longer, but will make haſte to
worship before the Lord. Many times God shews his greatneſs unto you,
and that convinceth your conſciences a little, and you think you muſt leave
your ſinfull wayes, then temptation prevailes over you againe; but when
God comes and makes known his goodnes, then the heart ſtands out againſt
the Lord no more, but it gives up it ſelfe to the Lord in an everlaſting cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.
Thirdly, They shall feare his goodneſs, they shall feare to offend <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
this goodneſs of God. It shal be a mighty ingagement upon their hearts to
walke cloſe with God becauſe of his goodneſs. This is a ſweet diſpoſition in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.
Then it is a ſweet diſpoſition when the heart hath been likewiſe hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
before God and his juſtice, and now feares God and his goodneſs,</p>
               <p>Mark a note in this by the way: Whereas many will ſay, O the goodnes
of God will breake our hearts; if Miniſters did preach onely his goodneſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>;
but when they preach the Law, when we heare of terrour, that hardneth our
hearts. Take heed of this, there is more evil in this then you are aware. A
heart that is truly gracious will fall down before the Lord any way, and it is
not a good ſigne to be wrought upon only by the goodneſs of God, it may
come through much ſtubbornneſs of heart for one to be of ſuch a diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to be onely wrought upon by kindneſs. Did you never know a ſtour ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
or a ſtout child, that ſo long as you are diſpeaſed with him, he would
ſtand out againſt you ſtill, but perhaps if you yeeld to him a little, he would
yeeld to you? Is this a good diſpoſition? is not this ſtoutneſs and pride in a
child, or in a ſervant, or in a neighbour, that will never yeeld to you till you
yeeld to him? This is juſt for all the world the diſpoſition of many people,
ſo long as they heare of Gods greatneſs, and terrours of the Law, and Gods
juſtice, they are hardned; what is that? that is, they ſtand it out ſtoutly againſt
God, notwithſtanding his wrath is revealed from heaven: But ſay they, when
Gods goodnes is preached, then they yeeld, that is as much as to ſay except
God yeeld to them they will not yeeld to God. But when I can yeeld hoth
ways, fear his goodnes &amp; his juſtice, then it is as a ſigne of a gracious diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
indeed. <hi>They ſhal feare his goodneſs,</hi> ſo as they shall be no longer wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
upon the goodnes of God, they ſhal not ſlight Gods goodneſs, they ſhal
not do evil becauſe God is good, but they shall fear his goodneſs. We have
a generation of men who doe extreamely abuſe the goodneſs of God at this
day, even Gods goodneſs in the Goſpell, in thoſe bleſſed things revealed
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:42662:279"/>
to us in JESUS CHRIST. As thus, VVe finde this revealed in the
Goſpel,<note place="margin">Wantons who abuſe Gods goodneſſe.</note> that it is God that muſt <hi>worke the will and the deed,</hi> the Covenant
of grace is ſuch, as that God doth not only require but work all for us; how
is this goodneſs miſ-interpreted and abuſed! Therefore ſay they, what need
we do any thing? Why doe Miniſters urge people to duties? Your princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
is good, the truth is good, that it is God that works all in the Covenant of
grace, but this diſtinction is very abſurd and vile, and an abuſe of Gods
goodneſſe, and therefore you muſt not work together with the Lord as rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
creatures.</p>
               <p>Again, The Goſpel reveales to us <hi>the righteouſneſs of God in Chriſt,</hi> that
we muſt not ſtand before God in our own righteouſneſſe, but it muſt be in
the righteouſneſs of Chriſt; this principle is good; O but what abuſe of this
goodneſs is there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> falſe doctrines, and abſurd conſequences drawn from it;
therefore to make conſcience of duties, what is it but legall? they are but du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
whore-mongers; ſuch kinde of bold and abſurd expreſſions come from
them. Oh wanton, wanton ſpirits who do not feare God and his goodneſs,
but abuſe God &amp; his goodneſs! Agaiu, The Scripture tells us in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
that all ſins unto believers are pardoned in Chriſt, all ſins both great and
ſmal, <hi>there is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt,</hi> no not one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of an houre after they are once juſtified; this is Gods goodneſſe, and
thou ſhouldeſt feare it, here is the principle right, but the deductions &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences
are vile, therefore to preach that we muſt be humbled for ſin, this
is legall preaching, neither will theſe men ever confeſſe their ſins becauſe of
this goodneſs of God. This is to be wanton, not to fear the goodnes of God.
The goodnes of God in the goſpell telleth us that the grace of God is ſtrong,
that the Saints ſhall perſevere, that thoſe that are once in Chriſt ſhall never
fall away; therefore let us take liberty to our ſelves, what need we be carefull

this goodnes of God thus is wicked, the heavens may bluſh to behold it, and
the earth tremble under it. But we have not ſo learned Chriſt, the more of
the goodnes of God in Chriſt is made known to us, the more ſhould we fear
him. The goodneſſe of God in the Goſpel is ſo rich that the truth is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the hearts of men are ſo vile, and ſo ready to abuſe it, we are almoſt
afraid to preach it. Oh is this the fruit of the preaching of the Goſpel? Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was the Goſpel ſo cleare as in England, and in no Age ſo as in this Age,
and is this the fruit of all, that men ſhould draw ſuch abſurd conſequences
from this goodneſſe of God, that men should goe away harder from that

may have it, though God ſees that many ſouls will be hardned by it, well,
ſaith God, let them be hardned, theſe my ſervants ſhall not want it, though
they periſh for ever. When a man hath a thing in his houſe, and he hears that

               <p>4. Fearing God and his goodneſſe is this, in all rejoycing in, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
God for his goodneſſe, there ſhall be a mixture of feare. They ſhall be
well skilled in this myſtery of godlineſſe, when they enjoy ſo much of Gods
goodneſs, and are called upon to ſing and rejoyce, they ſhal ſing with a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of feare. Their hearts ſhall be very ſerious and ſpirituall in all their joy.
It is very hard for us to rejoyce in Gods goodneſs, and not to have our hearts
grow ſlight and vain, it is a hard thing to keepe a day of thankeſgiving with a
ſerious ſpirit, joy commonly cauſeth vanity in the hearts of men. But now
the goodneſſe of God ſhall be ſo ſtrong in their hearts, that though they
ſhall ſeek Gods goodneſs, and rejoyce abundantly in it, yet with a mixture
of abundance of feare, their hearts ſhall be kept very ſerious, holy, and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
in the ſervice of God. I will give you a text or two for this. <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.

is like unto thee O Lord among the gods, who is like unto thee, glorious in
holineſs, fearful in praiſes?</hi> God is to be prayſed, but ſo prayſed as his name
muſt be fearfull in prayſes. Conſider this in all your joyfull celebrating the
memoriall of Gods goodneſs, you muſt ſo rejoyce and bleſſe God, as you
muſt hold forth this before all you converſe with, that the name of God is
fearfull in theſe praiſes you tender to him: this a ſlight heart cannot doe. So

               <p>God much delights to have the glory of his goodneſſe thus. We have
much goodneſſe of God at this day, and God calleth us to feare him and his
goodneſſe; if we give him not his glory in this, God may ſoone call us to
feare him and his greatneſſe; to feare him and his juſtice, to feare him and
his wrath. This is the argument now, <hi>there is forgiveneſſe with thee that
thou maiſt be feared.</hi> But how ſoon may God juſtly turn this argument,
there is wrath with thee, vengeance with thee, there is ſword, fire, blood,
ſtorm, an horrible tempeſt with thee, therefore ſhalt thou be feared? Our
conſciences are ready to miſgive us when wee have any evill tidings, for wee
have much guilt upon our ſpirits, we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

God, (who ever thought to have lived to ſee that goodneſſe you have ſeen)
but becauſe you have not feared God and his goodneſſe,<note place="margin">Differen ces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween legall feare &amp; evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall.</note> here is the reaſon of
thoſe miſgiving thoughts, when you heare of any ill newes, oh now God is
coming againſt us with his wrath, that he may be feared.</p>
               <p>Something might be ſaid to open a little the difference betweene fearing
God and his goodneſſe, and fearing God and his wrath and juſtice in a legall
way. Only thus in a word.</p>
               <p>The fearing God and his goodneſſe is ſuch a feare as enlargeth the heart.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Other feare contracts the heart. We have an excellent text for this, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.

ſee and flow together, and thy heart ſhall feare upon that, and be inlarged.</hi>
When the heart ſo feareth, as it is inlarged unto God, this is the fearing God
and his goodneſſe aright.</p>
               <p>Again, It is ſuch a feare as yet the heart clings to God for ever; It drives
not from God, but makes the heart cleave cloſer to him, that is the phraſe in
the Text in the Hebrew, <hi>They ſhall feare to God and to his goodneſſe, I will
put my fear in their hearts that they ſhal not depart from me.</hi> This keeps the
heart to God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Further, This fearing God and his goodneſſe workes the heart to a high
degree of ſanctification.</hi> 2 Cor. 7. 1. Seeing we have ſuch precious promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,

               <p>Laſtly, It is a feare that is joyned with love, whereas the other fear makes
the heart to have hard thoughts of God; take heed for ever of that feare of
God that makes you to have hard thoughts of him. In times of danger ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

               <p>This ſhall be in the latter dayes.</p>
               <p>God is content to ſtay for his glory untill the latter dayes, that which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
his chiefe glory; for though in theſe former dayes God hath had glory,
yet hee hath had but very little. God is content to ſtay for that which is his
chief glory untill the latter dayes. Let this be an argument for our patience,
though we have ſufferings now, let us wait as God waiteth.</p>
               <p>But <hi>the latter dayes,</hi> when are theſe? The times of the Goſpell are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
called <hi>the latter dayes;</hi> but this, though it referreth indeed to the whole
time of the Goſpel, yet eſpecially unto the latter times of thoſe latter dayes.
If you would know what theſe <hi>latter dayes</hi> are, though I will not take upon

that it is like theſe <hi>latter dayes</hi> are at hand.</p>
               <p>For giving light unto this, that is a good help to us that we have in <hi>Daniel,</hi>
concerning the four Kingdoms, there we have a propheticall Chronologie
from the Captivity of the Jews unto the time when the counſell of God ſhall
be fulfilled. You have a deſcription there of four ſeverall Monarchies, the
<hi>Babylonian, Aſſyrian, Grecian,</hi> and <hi>Roman:</hi> Now in the laſt of theſe <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi>
ſaith, <hi>Chap. 2. 44. The God of heaven ſhall ſet up a Kingdome which
ſhall never be deſtroyed, but it ſhall breake in pieces, and conſume all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Kingdomes, and it ſhall ſtand for ever.</hi> In this latter (namely the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>)
hath the Kingdom of Chriſt begun to appear already, but God telleth
<hi>Daniel,</hi> chap. 12. 13. <hi>Thou shalt ſtand in thy lot at the end of the dayes.</hi>
Now obſerve, the chiefe Propheſies wee have about the time of theſe latter
dayes, when they ſhall be ſet out in that expreſſion of <hi>time, and times, and
halfe a time,</hi> 1260. dayes, or 42. months, all comes to the ſame three years
and a halfe, reckoning every day in thoſe yeares for a yeare, compare theſe
propheſies, <hi>Dan. 7. 25. And they shall be given into his hand, untill a time

               </p>
               <p>But all the difficulty is to know the beginning when <hi>the three years and a

have in the <hi>Revelation</hi> (and that in <hi>Daniel</hi> likewiſe refers to the ſame) notes

               <p>But when did Antichriſt begin to reign?</p>
               <p>For that take this rule, It muſt be at that time when the Roman Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
was broken, and when the Dragon giveth up his power to the Beaſt;
when the power of the Dragon that perſecuted the Chriſtians under the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

               <p>That the Roman Empire muſt be given up firſt, appeareth, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 7

then that wicked one that ſhall <hi>exalt himſelfe above all that is called God,</hi>
ſhall have power to perſecure the Church. Hence it is obſervable, that the
cuſtome of the Church was to pray for the continuing the Roman Empire
upon this ground, becauſe they knew when that was broken Antichriſt
would come. Now the breaking of the Roman Empire was at the raiſing
up of thoſe ten ſeverall ſorts of governmens called in the Revel. <hi>tenn Kings,</hi>
and the raiſing up of thoſe Kings was 400. yeares and ſomething more after
Chriſt, as Chronologers tell us, between the 400. and 500. years. It is hard
to reckon to a year, there is ſo much difference in Chronologers computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
after that time there muſt be 1260. days, that is 1260. years. Make
this computation, and compare all theſe Scriptures one with another, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

none of the wicked ſhall underſtand, but the wiſe ſhall underſtand. Take
but one note and we have done, why the Scripture ſets <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>is out rather by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>dayes,</hi> then by ſo many <hi>yeares?</hi> The reaſon is, becauſe God would have
his people think that time untill his goodnes ſhould be revealed, but a ſhort
time, if he had ſaid they ſhould be 1260. years under Antichriſts perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
this founds harder; No, ſaith he, it ſhall be but ſo many dayes, (though
fleſh and blood may think this time long) yet look upon it as dayes, it is but
a ſhort time to me, it will be but a ſhort time to you, within 1260. days you
ſhall be delivered from his tyranny, and then you ſhall have this voyce from
heaven, <hi>The kingdoms of the earth are become the kingdomes of the Lord
and of his Chriſt, and hee ſhall reign for ever,</hi> and then ſhall ye together
with the Jews <hi>ſeeke the Lord, and David your King, and fear the Lord and
