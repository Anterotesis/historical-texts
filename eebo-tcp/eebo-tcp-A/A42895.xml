            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe inquity and licentiouſneſs of the times are ſuch, that thoſe wicked Principles which the moſt perverſe of men in former days would hardly truſt to their private thoughts, In theſe men impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently dare to publiſh.</p>

that which bears the Name of <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Redivivus.</hi> The Author ſeems ſo hardened and confirmed in his Villanous Errors, that he makes no ſcruple to offer Treaſon and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, for Reaſon and Loyalty: He would make us believe that he is ſupporting Our Government, whilſt he endeavours utterly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it: Propounds ruine and ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very in a quiet and peaceable way: And diſapproves a <hi>Civil</hi>

            <p>Now leaſt theſe, and many other Propoſitions, (howſoever illegal and extravagant) ſhould not be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced as chearfully as they are loyally and honeſtly intended, Our Author aſſures us, <hi>That he hath propoſed nothing in</hi>

               <hi>he was, or could be before:</hi> The Lords more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable when they receive their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours from <hi>the People,</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:53230:7"/>
when they were the <hi>Kings Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects:</hi> No Fires in <hi>London</hi> but of their <hi>own making,</hi> no Want in the Country, no Wars abroad, nor Troubles at home but of their <hi>own raiſing: Presbyterians</hi>
               <note place="margin">Page 186.</note> and <hi>Papiſts</hi> like Peace and Righteouſneſs ſhall kiſs each other: The Lyon ſhall lie down with the Lamb, and there ſhall be no more enmity between the Serpent and the Seed of the Woman.</p>
            <p>Nay, ſuch is the force of our wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>working politick Apoſtle, that provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his Tyrannical, Popular <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may take place againſt a Lawful, Natural, &amp; the moſt Eaſie Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy upon Earth, all Intereſts will be reconciled, all Perſons, of whatſoever different Principles or Profeſſions they be, whether <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Greek,</hi> a <hi>Samaritan,</hi> or of the dwellers of

            <p>Now although the extravagances &amp; fallacies of our vain Magiſterial Author, are obvious enough to all ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, conſidering men, yet ſince <hi>Error</hi> is more communicative than <hi>Truth,</hi> and ſome men (eſpecially ſuch as may be already prejudiced are more apt to embrace <hi>Shadows,</hi> than retain <hi>Subſtances,</hi> I have endeavoured to diſtinguiſh <hi>Both,</hi> unmask our <hi>Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blican Daemon,</hi> &amp; ſhew no leſs his horrid <hi>Claws,</hi> than his <hi>Cloven-feet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhould now make ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe that this Anſwer comes ſo late into the World, but I have a ſufficient Witneſs, that I had never

ſeen the Book call'd <hi>Plato Redivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus,</hi> before I received it at <hi>Paris,</hi> about <hi>May</hi> laſt, from My Lord <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton,</hi> His Majeſties Envoy Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary in the <hi>French</hi> Court: To his Lordſhip, I owe the firſt motion, and encouragement of anſwering it, you the advantage (if any be) and ſatisfaction of the Anſwer.</p>
            <p>Next I muſt inform you, that I meddle little with the Law-part, which is now and then to be met withal in Our Author; not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath been ſufficiently an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd already, but beſides, if there be any breach of the Law or Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by any Perſon whatſoever, the Courts of Juſtice are open, which are the proper places for Law mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and when <hi>Plato</hi> ſhall think fit to ſhew himſelf and legally accuſe, both himſelf, and ſuch other of the
<pb facs="tcp:53230:9"/>
Kings Subjects, who may have been deceived by him, will receive a more full &amp; ample ſatisfaction, than I durſt pretend to give them.</p>
            <p>The hiſtorical and rational part I endeavour to anſwer as plainly, as my judgment and little time would permit, which I have done alſo by way of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, that I might in all things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with Our Authors method, as far as is reaſonable. Many impertinencies I have paſſed by to avoid tediouſneſs. Thoſe faults in this Diſcourſe which ſhall not be found malicious, I hope the Reader will excuſe; ſmall mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes may be eaſily rectified. And as to the whole, if the Reader ſhall pleaſe to examine it as impartially, as it is writ ſincerely, I perſuade my ſelf, that he will find nothing misbecoming an Honeſt Man and a Loyal Subject.

                  <p>I have now ſpent ſomewhat more than Eight years, (as you know <hi>Couſin</hi>) out of <hi>England.</hi> The firſt time
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53230:11"/>
I went abroad, I only learnt my Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, and made thoſe <hi>Tours</hi> of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> which generally other Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen uſe to do.

                  <p>But having almoſt loſt the <hi>bon gouſt,</hi> as they ſay, or relliſh for thoſe youthful pleaſures, ſince I went laſt abroad, I have made other remarks, and grown more ſullen poſſibly than I ought to be; can tell you now of the pride and liberti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage of the <hi>French Nobleſſe,</hi> the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence, <hi>coquetry</hi> and debauchery of the Gentry, the miſery of the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty, the extream poverty of moſt, and ſlavery of all.

that they ſtarve even a <hi>Jew</hi> in his own Trade: Their frequent aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, pride and ill manners.

                  <p>Now, Couſin, with all I have ſaid, compare the extream happineſs of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation.

                  <p>But above all let us reflect ſeriouſly upon the moſt happy ſecurity and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our Perſons and Eſtates, which all ſtrangers are forc't both to admire and envy: Our freedom and exemption from all manner of Taxes and Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but ſuch as we our ſelves ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to.</p>
                  <p>And not to be too tedious upon a ſubject which is ſo large, let us truly conſider, and at the ſame time bleſs God Almighty for our juſt Laws, and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial execution of them, for the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble &amp; equal Conſtitution of our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; where the Prince hath ſo great a power, and the People ſuch ample pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, that as our form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is Monarchy, and that as perfect and free as the Sun ever ſaw, ſo it is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally ſecur'd from the corruption of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny.</p>

                  <p>Yes, Sir, and under any good Government beſides our own, eſpecially in that Republick, which he ſo much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires, both himſelf and his works would have been made publick Sacrifices to Juſtice, and to the quiet of the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd Government, long before now.</p>

                  <p>But is it not hard, that a Man of great Learning, ſhould not have liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to give his Judgment in a caſe of ſo great conſequence, as the Peace and Security of our Government, under which our lives and fortunes, and our all, are to be preſerv'd or ſhipwrack'd; eſpecially when his deſign is ſo apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good and commendable?</p>

                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Couſin,</hi> as to our preſent Author, to deal plainly with you, I cannot poſſibly remark, either his great Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or his good deſign. But ſuppoſing he had both (which I ſhall hardly grant you) yet I muſt maintain, that any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſon, who unauthoriz'd by our lawful Government, ſhall publiſh either by words or writings, any arguments or diſcourſe, againſt the Conſtitution of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53230:16"/>
the Government by Law eſtabliſh'd, is a peſtilent, pragmatical Deceiver, a ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious <hi>Calumniator,</hi> and <hi>Perturbator</hi> of our Peace: His words and writings become ſcandalous <hi>Libels,</hi> and both deſerve the extreameſt puniſhments, which the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of the Law or Reaſon in that caſe provides.</p>

                  <p>Sir, I ask your pardon; for whilſt you entertain me with ſo much kindneſs, it were indeed unreaſonable that I ſhould offend you in the Perſon of any Man, for whom you may bear the leaſt reſpect.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mer.</speaker>
                  <p>No, no, Sir, you miſtake me; for in the firſt place I have no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the author, ſuppoſing it, whom common fame ſpeaks him: Beſides, want of freedom in diſcourſe, abates ſo much of the profit, as well as the pleaſure of it, that I muſt conjure you to uſe all the liberty henceforward imaginable, and ſo with your good leave I intend to do my ſelf. But I confeſs I wonder'd a little to ſee you ſo warm and vigorous in the Defence of a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53230:16"/>
under which we muſt needs agree, that even to our own knowledg, and poſſibly amongſt our own friends, there have happen'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> caſes very ſevere (not to ſay more) which ſure muſt be faults, either in the Governours, or the Government.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Trav.</speaker>
                  <p>Perhaps in neither, for though as you ſay, we may have remembred many particular caſes, which to us have ſeem'd hard, yet it may be, if we had fully examin'd the circumſtances of each caſe, we ſhould have found, either ſome miſmanagment in the Perſon, or ſome very unlucky contingency, which neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects or misfortunes we preſently throw upon the Government, that we may the eaſier diſcharge our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Indeed ſuch particular caſes, how hard ſoever they may ſeem to thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, yet ought they not to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bias or prejudice a Mans Reaſon or Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, much leſs make him undermine, and endeavour to ſhake the very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of our preſent Government; which having ſubſiſted ſo long, been conſtituted, approved, confirmed, by ſo many wiſe, juſt, and valiant Princes;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53230:17"/>
and conſented to, eſtabliſhed, and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiouſly aſſerted by ſuch a long Series of our grave, and learned Anceſtors, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains the ſame at this day in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial part, which it ever hath been in the beſt of times, and under the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of much greater <hi>Politicians</hi> than our <hi>quack Stateſman,</hi> (who ever he was) ſeems to have been.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mer.</speaker>
                  <p>I know not what our former Conſtitution hath been. It is ſufficient to mind you, that <hi>now</hi> the incertainty of grants, and Court favours hath been ſuch, that many men have never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, what with great pains and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence they thought they had obtained; and I ſtill think that a fault.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Trav.</speaker>
                  <p>I gueſs poſſibly what you mean, and I confeſs <hi>Machiavel</hi> above all things adviſes his Prince to avoid the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of eaſineſs, or unſteadineſs. He would not have him be, <hi>Varius,</hi> or <hi>Levis,</hi> as he calls it. But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, to be ſo firm and conſtant in all that he ſays, or reſolves, as not to leave in any Man, ſo much as the hopes of moving or deceiving him. <hi>Ita ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam ſuam quam ſemel pronuntiavit, ratam
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53230:17"/>
ac firmam haberi velit, ut ab ea nunquam deduci, aut dimoveri poſſe procerto te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neant, ac talem de ſe opinionem ſuſtineri ac retineri ſtudeat, ut illorum nemo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niat, ut illum aut decipi aut flecti poſſe cogitet.</hi> This certainly is good advice, and poſſibly very proper in our circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; and this exact care of a Prince in keeping his word, and not paſſing one <hi>grant</hi> over the head of another, might be more practicable in the little Government, under which <hi>Machiavel</hi> wrote, than in ours, which hath ſuch numerous Offices depending upon his Majeſties grace and favour. But ſtill if this <hi>Fermete,</hi> be wanting, and hard caſes do ſometimes happen, yet nothing can be more ridiculous and unjuſt, than pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to accuſe the Government: For ſuch things have happen'd under the beſt forms of Government that ever have been, or ever will be, whether Monarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal or Democratical, and will ever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, whilſt we are govern'd by men, who are all more or leſs naturally ſubject to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable frailties. We muſt therefore di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh between the Supream Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and the ſubordinate ones, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53230:18"/>
both from the Conſtitution of the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi> The firſt, as I ſaid, are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to weakneſſes and infirmities, and when they are too frequent, I mean in the ſubordinate Officers, they may be eaſily remov'd or chang'd, without deſtroying or altering the Government.</p>
                  <p>For as a man would be juſtly thought mad, or highly imprudent, who find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that by the negligence of Servants, a Door-poſt, or Window, a Joyſt, Beam or Rafter of his Houſe had been decay'd, ſhould immediately pull down the whole building, with a deſign to repair only thoſe little breaches; ſo that Politician is certainly moſt unfit for a Prince's Cabinet, or Houſe of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who finding, it may be, ſome miſmanagement in State-affairs, ſhould preſently reſolve to pull down the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick it ſelf, I mean Monarchy, and in its place build up a phantaſtical Commonwealth, then tranſform that into an Optimacy, then an Oligarchy, till having paſt through all the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, which innovation and change have generally produc'd, we fall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily into confuſion and Anarchy,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53230:18"/>
and in that moſt miſerable ſtate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come either Slaves to ſome mechanical Tyrant, ſprung up from the Lees of the people, and rais'd by the foul breath of vulgar applauſe, or made eternally a pittiful Province loaden with afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and groaning under the heavy Taxes of a foreign Conquerour.</p>
                  <p>By this time, <hi>Couſin,</hi> I hope you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the difference between Governours and Governments; the ſolid Foundation, or the whole Houſe it ſelf, from its Ornaments, or ſome neceſſary or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient parts of it, and the dangers which attend the change of the one, more than of the other. I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſhew you next, if you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand me, what unjuſt pretences our old neglected Politician has found out, to endeavour an alteration in either, and what falſe arguments he produces to favour his pretence.</p>

                  <p>Come then, let us walk. You ſee, <hi>Couſin,</hi> that my Garden is but ſmall, but the Soil is very proper for Fruit, and lies well enough to the South Sun, which is a great advantage to us.</p>

                  <speaker>Trav.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes: And I ſee you have plaſht your Vines upon <hi>Treilles;</hi> which ſure ripens the Fruit better than when they touch the Walls.

                  <p>The ſame. There we ſhall have a very fine proſpect over a great part of our Country. But what will pleaſe me much better, I hope to have there the advantage of your Diſcourſe, upon a ſubject, which will be no leſs delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than profitable, to a man who has had neither time nor learning enough to examine thoſe high points, which do not much belong to a man of my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</p>

                  <speaker>Trav.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir, I am very well ſatisfied concerning your judgment and your learning alſo: For I remember you were reputed the beſt Scholar in <hi>Paul</hi>'s School, when I was at <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi> And if the death of your Father had not happen'd in the nick of time, you were deſign'd for <hi>Oxford,</hi> when I went
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53230:20"/>
to <hi>Cambridg.</hi> However having lately had occaſion to read ſomewhat more of theſe matters, than it may be you have done, I ſhall be very willing to give you my opinion, as far as my reading goes, provided you will excuſe my ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and preſumption, in ſeeming to inform you of what poſſibly you are better inſtructed than my ſelf.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>

                  <p>Pray, dear <hi>Couſin,</hi> let's loſe no time in complements, we are now in the Arbour, and here are ſeats conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient enough.</p>

                  <speaker>Trav.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir, I am ready to obey your commands. And that we may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in ſome method, at leaſt as good as your Author there has taken; and becauſe I ſuppoſe it is thought by ſome, that he has treated as fully and clearly upon that ſubject, as is neceſſary to ſatisfie a reaſonable man, let us examine him from the beginning to the end.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mer.</speaker>
                  <p>That I fear will be too tedious for you.</p>

                  <p>No Sir, you have only to read thoſe places, which are marked with the red lead Pen; And if you pleaſe to add any arguments of your own
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53230:20"/>
(which I am confident will have more weight, than many which he has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd) I will endeavour to give you the moſt plain and ſatisfactory Anſwers I can.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mer.</speaker>
                  <p>Agreed; And in the firſt place I find, you have wounded even <hi>Plato</hi> himſelf in the very Title of the Book.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Trav.</speaker>
                  <p>No Sir, it is only his Ghoſt or <hi>Doemon, Plato Redivivus;</hi> For to tell you the truth, I never was a friend to ſuch troubleſome ſpirits. But in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, do you not think it a little arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance in our Polypragmatick (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the gentle excuſe of the Publiſher) to aſſume the Title even of <hi>Plato</hi> himſelf. I am confident, could <hi>Plato</hi> look into the world again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he would be much aſham'd to ſee how ill a figure his Ghoſt makes among all ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber men, and it would prove a ſecond death more cruel than the firſt, to ſee himſelf ſo ill <hi>Traveſtie.</hi>

                  <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
                  <p>But <hi>Couſin,</hi> he that maintains <hi>Plato</hi>'s opinions, may ſurely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offence call himſelf <hi>Plato</hi>'s Friend and Diſciple, and <hi>Honoris gratia,</hi> as our Author ſays, take upon himſelf the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53230:21"/>
name of him, whom he admires and follows; that is common enough at this day among our ſelves.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Trav.</speaker>
                  <p>'Tis true, but in that caſe he ought rather to have ſtiled himſelf <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Britannicus:</hi> That would have made diſtinction enough between the Maſter and the Scholar, agreed better with the inſtances which you have brought on his behalf, and have been more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt than <hi>Redivivus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>However you muſt conſider that <hi>Plato</hi> and others living then under Common-wealths, wrote in favour of that Form of Government, under which their lives and fortunes were protected. And beſides, many of them, being but the late corruptions of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy or Ariſtocracy, wanted the learn'd Philoſopher's defence. But to alter, nay totally deſtroy the ancient eſtabliſh'd Government, under which we enjoy all the bleſſings and liberties, which our Anceſtors ever did, or we can reaſonably deſire, would have been ſo much contrary to the Wiſdom and Judgment of <hi>Plato,</hi> that he would no more-have wrote in our days, for a
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53230:21"/>
Democracy in <hi>London,</hi> than for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy at <hi>Athens.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Add to this the vaſt difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the State of <hi>Greece</hi> in thoſe days, and that of Great <hi>Britain</hi> in theſe: The firſt was divided into ſeveral dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Governments, all aemulous of one anothers greatneſs, and were often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times forc'd to make great alterations in their Polities, according to the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, or ſucceſs of their Neighbours, who beſides were all upon the ſame Continent, and had no other bounds or ſeparation between them, than a hedge or brook, or at moſt a little River.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>England</hi> having ſubſiſted glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly and happily, more than 1700 years, as authentick Hiſtory can wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, under a Monarchical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and divided from the world by a Ditch which nature has made, not eaſily paſſable, <hi>Toto diviſos orbe Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannos,</hi> fears no interruption whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, in our Tranquillity or Government, but ſuch as may proceed from ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men, whom falſe miſchievous and calumniating perſons (ſuch as our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53230:22"/>
may, if tolerated, decoy into ſome Rebellion as unnatural, as to themſelves deſtructive.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, I appeal to all wiſe men, whether the Government of <hi>Athens</hi> in thoſe days, be more appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable and neceſſary for us and ours in theſe, than to affirm, that the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>France</hi> could not poſſibly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, except they introduce the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of <hi>Geneva,</hi> or Polity of the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Commonwealth of <hi>Luca</hi> or <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noua.</hi>

                  <p>I am much pleaſed with this way of reaſoning, and am well ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd, that times, and places, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, may alter our reaſon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly, and that no one <hi>Polity,</hi> or Form of Governments or laws whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, are univerſally proper for all places.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Plato,</hi> I think, introduc'd in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, a commonalty or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon uſe of Wives or Women, as well as of all other Goods and Chattels. <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgus</hi> forbad the uſe of Gold and Silver, divided all the Lands equally amongſt all, and permitted the noble

exerciſe of ſtealing.

                  <p>This, <hi>Couſin,</hi> is thus far very plain and ſatisfactory, that is to ſay, that the ancient Cuſtoms, Laws, and Governments of <hi>Greece,</hi> or any other part of the World, though contriv'd and modell'd by men extreamly learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and moſt proper for thoſe times and Countries, where they were in force, are not for that ſingle reaſon practicable in our days, and in our Kingdom, any farther than our caſe and circumſtances agree with theirs.</p>

                  <p>In theſe Diſtractions and Afflictions, the more ſober part did believe, That nothing could ſo truly heal their Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances as returning again under the Government of a Monarch; whoſe
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53230:30"/>
Power being deſpotical, might, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as himſelf ſhould think moſt juſt, end all their Differences, by eaſing the Poor, without exaſperating the Rich.</p>
                  <p>In this Conjuncture, <hi>Solon</hi> (being a rich Merchant, and a wiſe Man, and living ſplendidly enough) grew ſo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular, that the common People invited him to take the Government wholly upon himſelf. Two of the Parties were very zealous in it, and the third ſeem'd well enough ſatisfy'd that the Management of all ſhould be in the Hands of ſo prudent a Man, as he was thought to be.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Solon</hi> very unadviſedly refuſing what was offer'd him, ſuffer'd himſelf to be choſen after <hi>Philombrotus</hi> their <hi>Archon;</hi> and then, to gratifie the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who had been ſo reſpective to him, he aboliſheth their Debts, and gave them a greater ſhare in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than in good reaſon and Policy they ought to have had.

                  <p>Very well, Sir. The next thing is, We have <hi>plaid handy dandy with Parliaments, and eſpecially the Houſe of</hi> Commons, <hi>(the only Part which is now left entire of the old Conſtitution) by adjourning, proroguing, and diſſolving

                  <p>That's enough. I have only to remark his two Parentheſiſes. In the firſt he tells us, That <hi>the Houſe of Commons is the only part that is now left entire of the old Conſtitution.</hi> Pray, <hi>Couſin,</hi> Have you heard what is become of the <hi>Houſe of Peers?</hi> or, Do you know how it comes to be leſs entire than ever it was? I am perſwaded you cannot tell me.</p>

                  <speaker>Mer.</speaker>
                  <p>I imagine his Meaning may be, that their Eſtates are not ſo great as formerly they have been; or that the Houſe of Commons depended more upon them formerly than now they do.</p>

                  <p>For the firſt, it is falſe, there being as great Eſtates now in the Houſe of Lords, as, generally, ever there were. And for the dependance of the Commons upon the Lords, that is to ſay, <hi>wearing their blew Coats, making up their Lords-train, waiting upon them to the Houſe of Lords, and making a La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>But Sir, with his good leave, and the Commoners too I take the Houſe of Commons to be the lateſt Addition to that Aſſembly, which altogether we call a Parliament. I do not remember to have heard any News of a Houſe of Commons, as it is now underſtood, untill ſeveral Years after the <hi>Norman</hi> Conqueſt, that is, untill the end of the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, at ſooneſt.

                  <p>And although at firſt this great Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Truſt in ſo few hands, was look'd upon as a great Obligation to <hi>thoſe Lords,</hi> and a great Security to <hi>that King,</hi> ſo long as their Intereſts ſtood united in their new Conqueſt; yet, in the next Age, when the heat of that Action was over, their Intereſts divided, and the Obligation forgotten, it proved to the ſucceeding Kings ſo great a Curb and Reſtraint to Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty, that nothing fell more inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately into their Care, than how to retrench (as much as they durſt) the Power of that Nobility which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſuſpect, and was like, in time, to <hi>mate</hi> even Monarchy it ſelf.</p>

                  <p>But, begging your Pardon for this long Story, I now proceed to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Parentheſis;</hi> in which, he makes no Scruple, to accuſe his preſent Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and his late <hi>Sacred Father, of breaking the Law,</hi> in <hi>adjourning, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roguing, and diſſolving Parliaments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed, <hi>Couſin,</hi> I know nothing that reflects more truly upon the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Government, than that it ſuffers ſuch peſtilent ſeditious Men, as our Author ſeems to be, to live under it. For nothing ſure is more evident, in the whole or any part of the Law, whether <hi>Statute, common</hi> or <hi>cuſtomary,</hi> than that the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> ever ſince the firſt Parliament that ever was call'd, have had, and exercis'd the ſame Power, in <hi>adjourning, proroguing,</hi> and <hi>diſſolving them,</hi> as his preſent Majeſty
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:53230:45"/>
or his <hi>Father</hi> of Bleſſed Memory, ever did.</p>
                  <p>And, that you may have <hi>Plato's own</hi> Authority againſt <hi>himſelf,</hi> I muſt anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate ſo much of his Diſcourſe, as to inform you, That in <hi>p.</hi> 105. you will find theſe very Words; <hi>That which is undoubtedly the King's Right, or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, is, to</hi> Call <hi>and</hi> Diſſolve <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nay more, ſo great was the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Prerogative of our Kings over the Houſe of Commons, according to their <hi>old Conſtitution,</hi> That they have in their Writs of Summons <hi>named</hi> and <hi>appointed</hi> the <hi>particular Perſons</hi> all over <hi>England,</hi> who were to be returned to their Parliaments: ſometimes have or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, that <hi>only one Knight</hi> for the Shire and <hi>one Burgeſs</hi> for a Corporation, ſhould be ſent to their Parliaments, and thoſe alſo <hi>named to the Sheriffs,</hi> and ſometimes more; as may be ſeen, by the very Writs of <hi>Edw.</hi> 2. and <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. fully recited by the aforeſaid Dr. <hi>Brady,</hi> from <hi>p.</hi> 243. to <hi>p.</hi> 252.</p>

                  <p>Government then, began with the World, and God, who had the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Right of Power over the whole Univerſe, inveſted <hi>Adam</hi> with ſo much as was neceſſary for the Government of this World, and that in ſuch expreſs Words, that there can remain no doubt, but ſuch as is malicious and willful. <hi>And God ſaid, be fruitful and multiply, and repleniſh the Earth, and ſubdue it, and have Dominion over the Fiſh of the Sea, and over the Foul of the Air, and over every living thing that moveth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And, leaſt thoſe Words, <hi>every living thing,</hi> ſhould not yet be general enough to comprehend Mankind, God gives <hi>Adam</hi> the rule over his Wife <hi>Eve,</hi> the only humane Subject that was then upon Earth, and from whom, all the Race of Mankind was to proceed.</p>
                  <p>And ſurely <hi>Adam</hi> had naturally a Right of Power over thoſe whom him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:53230:47"/>
begot. Unto <hi>Cain</hi> God gave the rule over his Brother <hi>Abel,</hi> and after God had baniſh'd him from the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his Father, he builds a City, and ſecures it by Walls. Can any body be ſo blind as not to ſee that <hi>Cain</hi> was abſolutely Governour of the Place, and had an undoubted <hi>Right of Power</hi> over thoſe Subjects which proceeded out of his own Loins?</p>
                  <p>I confeſs, the Affairs of that Age be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Flood, are a little obſcure; and ſince <hi>Moſes</hi> thought fit to paſs them over with ſo great Silence, it is reaſonable we ſhould do ſo too. But, we may moſt probably conjecture, as well from that ſhort Hiſtory in the Bible, as from the Authority of <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus,</hi> and after him <hi>Grotius,</hi> That the neglect of Government, and of the exerciſe of Power in thoſe days, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd the Deluge: for formerly Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was but a trouble; and as the beſt of Men cared for no more than was neceſſary for the Preſervation of their particular Families, ſo ſome were unnatural enough to abandon their Children to the Licentiquſneſs of their

                  <p>But howſoever it was before the Flood, I ſuppoſe it will be ſufficient for our purpoſe, if we deduce the Hiſtory of Government, and the <hi>Right of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> from the Reſtauration of Mankind to the firſt <hi>Grecian</hi> Kingdoms; which, I hope, may be done ſo plainly, and that by the Authority of approv'd Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, that not only <hi>Europe, Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> but even <hi>America</hi> it ſelf, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the imperfect Accounts of <hi>Solon, Plato,</hi> and <hi>Pliny,</hi> and of later Authors, <hi>Joſephus Acoſta,</hi> and <hi>Herrera,</hi> will appear to have been repeopled and govern'd abſolutely by <hi>Fathers</hi> of <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies.</hi>

                  <p>I think, there are very few who doubt the Truth of the Flood it ſelf.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Nature</hi> is certainly a God, or elſe, rather, the <hi>Opifex Dei,</hi> whom we call <hi>Natura naturata,</hi> that is, the <hi>Cauſa Cauſata,</hi> or ſecond general <hi>Cauſe</hi> of all ſublunary Beings whatſoever.

I ſay, whether God cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated all things out of <hi>Nothing,</hi> which we cannot conceive, or out of this <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:53230:50"/>
prima,</hi> which we can as hardly explain, I'll not determine. It is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, for my purpoſe, to declare, that God is the <hi>firſt Cauſe,</hi> and made mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and that what I here call <hi>Nature</hi> is the <hi>ſecond Cauſe.</hi> Who, working up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſecond Matter, or <hi>materia Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentata,</hi> produceth ſeveral Effects, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its ſeveral Diſpoſitions.</p>

The God of <hi>Nature</hi> only hath the power of Annihilation; and as he made all things out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ſo he alone can again reduce all things into nothing.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, <hi>Nature</hi> is moſt juſt and good in all her Actions. And as ſhe hath receiv'd the Command of <hi>Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> from him who hath given her the Power of Generation, ſo ſhe hath tranſmitted that inviolable Precept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all things, which ſhe hath made, according to their different Kinds and Species. And this is the Ground and Foundation of that univerſal <hi>Law</hi> of

                     <hi>Nature,</hi> which is ſo immutable, that it cannot be changed. <hi>Jus naturale adeo immutabile eſt, ut ne à Deo quidem mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tari queat,</hi> ſaith <hi>Grot. l.</hi> 1.</p>

And indeed, we ſee it moſt plainly by the Effects: for, amongſt the various kinds of Beaſts and Fowl, there is ſcarce a Creature found which is not ſolicitous to preſerve its Young. And by this Law of preſerving what we have produc'd, the World was govern'd, from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes.</hi> And had we as exactly obſerv'd this Law of Nature as ſhe hath obey'd that of the firſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, the World ſure would have need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no other Law, nor known any other Government.</p>

                  <p>It conſiſts chiefly (as it relates to our Caſe) in their Ignorance of the Hiſtory of the Creation, and want of a true Notion of the Deity.

                     <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> gives us a long ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Creation; where, amongſt other things, he tells us, That when the great <hi>Separation</hi> was made of the Waters from the Earth, the Earth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd, nevertheleſs, very moiſt, over which a <hi>Pellicule,</hi> or kind of <hi>Skin,</hi> in moſt places was ſpread.

                  <p>
                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:53230:56"/>After this, the Moiſture and Surface of the Earth being hardened, and dry'd, by the continual heat of the Sun and drying Winds, the Earth could no more produce any conſiderable Creatures, but that they were henceforward propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Generation, according to their ſeveral Kinds and Species.</p>
                  <p>Now, Sir, notwithſtanding this fine Fancy, you may eaſily ſee its great Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, if you conſider, that the Earth produc'd thoſe living Creatures either by Chance or Accident, or by the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Will of God.</p>
                  <p>If the laſt, then we ſhall eaſily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with you, it being indifferent to us which way God was pleas'd to take for the making of Man, ſuppoſing he was made and propagated ſucceſſively by Gods Order: but this the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers generally deny.</p>
                  <p>If the firſt, Then how comes it to paſs, that Accident and Chance ſhould form Male and Female, ſo fitting for the work of Generation, that few things do more manifeſtly declare the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of our Maker, than the Compoſure of thoſe Organs, which ſerve for the

                  <p>And indeed, when we come to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider ſeriouſly of what many of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients have deliver'd concerning the Creation of the World, we ſhall not find them ſo different from the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Moſes</hi> as ſome imagine.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Phoenicians</hi> and <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and ſome later Philoſophers, as <hi>Ariſtotle, Anaxagoras,</hi> and amongſt the Poets, <hi>Heſiod, Orpheus, Ovid, Virgil,</hi> and others, ſuppoſing that Mankind pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded originally from the <hi>Earth,</hi> have aſcribed the Production to ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Cauſe, as the <hi>brooding of a Pigeon upon the</hi> Chaos, <hi>incubitum columbae, Anaxagoras</hi> to <hi>a Mind, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Sir, I believe moſt aſſuredly the Hiſtory of the Creation, as <hi>Moſes</hi> hath wrote it, and think, that in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as well as Conſcience, we ought ſo to do. But, ſetting aſide the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſpiration, Are there any other Reaſons why we ought rather to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>Moſes</hi> in that Particular, than any other of the Learned <hi>Grecian</hi> Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers?</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Trav.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, Sir, there are three principal Reaſons, which ought to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:53230:57"/>
our Belief for <hi>Moſes</hi> rather than for any other Hiſtorian whatſoever. And they are, firſt, The <hi>Antiquity</hi> of his Hiſtory; ſecondly, The <hi>Reaſon</hi> in his Hiſtory; and thirdly, the <hi>Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> of others concerning both.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt, It is agreed by the <hi>Greeks</hi> themſelves, That they have no Hiſtory ancienter than that of <hi>Homer. Conſtat apud Groecos nulla invenitur con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptio poëmate</hi> Homeri <hi>vetuſtior,</hi> ſaith <hi>Joſephus contra Appion.</hi> And yet <hi>Homer</hi> liv'd above ſix hundred Years after <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, not to trouble you with what you may find elſewhere, I ſhall refer you to the ſame <hi>Joſephus,</hi> and to <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius de Verit. Rel. Chriſt.</hi> and laſt of all, to the <hi>Origines Sacroe</hi> of Dr. <hi>Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Gale's Court of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the Reaſon of his Hiſtory, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially as it relates to the Creation of Man, nothing ſeems more juſt, than that God Almighty, who is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all Wiſdom and Goodneſs, ſhould have rather choſen to propagate
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:53230:58"/>
the World at firſt, as he did at laſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Flood by <hi>Succeſſion,</hi> than by ſuch a promiſcuous Production of the Earth as is before mention'd; that even there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he might prevent (as he did) that <hi>State of War</hi> ſuppos'd by our Author, and thoſe many Miſchiefs and Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences which would attend an Equality intolerable, and never yet known upon the Earth. And notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the ridiculous Arguments of Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> and ſome others, they could never yet produce any good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities or Examples, where this Equality was ever to be found, except in their own Underſtandings. The Learned <hi>Pompenatius,</hi> in his Treatiſe <hi>de immort. Animoe,</hi> tells us, That if the Inequality which is amongſt Men were taken away, the Race of Mankind would be deſtroy'd, or at beſt, ſubſiſt with great Inconvenience; and that it is not the occaſion of Diſcord, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the moſt perfect Harmony. <hi>Hoecque inoequalitas, ſi toleretur, aut genus h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, by this <hi>ſucceſſive Propagation</hi> God hath ſecur'd Man's Preſervation, and that by introducing a natural form of Government and Obedience, ſo certain, and ſo reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that it might have continued even to this day, had not the Negligence of the Governours in the firſt Age per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a Confuſion. And the Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Avarice both of the Governours and Governed in the latter Age, ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled the Reins, that they have made it ſometimes as hard to drive as to be driven.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, the compiling of the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhews ſo demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the Wiſdom and Reaſon of the Law-giver, that his Laws have been the Ground and Patterns for the beſt and moſt ancient both of the <hi>Attick</hi> or <hi>Greek,</hi> as well as <hi>Roman</hi> Inſtitutions.</p>

                  <p>Did you ever meet with a more impudent or more ignorant Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor? You remember, I ſuppoſe, thoſe Inſtances which I have already produc'd to demonſtrate the repeopling the World by <hi>Fathers</hi> of <hi>Families,</hi> which are confirm'd to us by approv'd and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reproachable Authors. Beſides, what
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:53230:60"/>
is more notoriouſly known, than the Hiſtory of the <hi>Edomites,</hi> or the Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Eſau</hi> or <hi>Edom,</hi> and the Hatred which continued in his Family againſt the Sons of <hi>Jacob,</hi> when they deny'd the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> Paſſage through their Country. Nay ſo certain is it, that that great Nation deſcended from <hi>Edom,</hi> who was the eldeſt Son of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and Father of his Family, and that they ſpread as far as the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> that the <hi>Greeks themſelves,</hi> from his Name <hi>Edom,</hi> which they interpret <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, have left the Name of <hi>Mare Erythroeum,</hi> even to this day.</p>
                  <p>Nor leſs known is the Genealogy of <hi>Iſmael</hi> the Son of <hi>Abraham,</hi> from whence the <hi>Iſmaelites</hi> or <hi>Arabians,</hi> whom <hi>Epiphanius</hi> calls the <hi>Saracens,</hi> are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neally deſcended.</p>
                  <p>And, as a conſtant Mark of their unqueſtionable Deſcent from <hi>Iſmael,</hi> they have, to our Age, retain'd the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of being circumciſed after the <hi>thirteenth</hi> Year, according to what we find written of their Father <hi>Iſmael</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="104" facs="tcp:53230:61"/>There are beſides, as I told you, many more undoubted Inſtances in thoſe Authors, which I have already nam'd to you. And if our Politician hath any reſpect for the Holy Bible and Hiſtory of <hi>Moſes,</hi> let me recommend him to the twenty fifth Chap. of <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> where <hi>Moſes</hi> numbring the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſmael,</hi> concludes, <hi>Theſe are the Sons of</hi> Iſmael, <hi>and theſe are their Names, by their Towns and by their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, twelve Princes according to their Nations. And they dwelt from</hi> Havila <hi>unto</hi> Shur, <hi>that is before</hi> Egypt, <hi>as thou goeſt towards</hi> Aſſyria. And whilſt he hath the Book in his hand, let him turn forward to the thirty ſixth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> where, after a long Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of the Dukes and Kings which deſcended lineally from <hi>Eſau,</hi> it is ſaid, ver. 31. <hi>And theſe are the Kings that reigned in the Land of</hi> Edom <hi>before there reigned any King over the Children of Iſrael. And theſe are the Names of the Dukes that came of</hi> Eſau, <hi>according to their Families, after their Places, by their Names.</hi> And Verſe the laſt, <hi>Theſe
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:53230:61"/>
be the Dukes of</hi> Edom <hi>according to their Habitations, in the Land of their Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, he is</hi> Eſau <hi>the Father of the</hi> Edomites.</p>
                  <p>Now what can be more particular or expreſs, than what I have here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd? Or what can he mean by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Foundation of Polities, which are, or ever came to our Knowledge ſince the World began, if theſe will not paſs for ſuch?</p>
                  <p>He cannot pretend that we ſhould bring a long Roll of Parchment, like a <hi>Welch</hi> Pedigree, <hi>ap Shinkin, ap Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,</hi> and ſo from the Son to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, untill we arrive at ap <hi>Iſmael, ap Eſau, ap Magog, ap Javan,</hi> and ſo forth: that would be too childiſh to imagine of him; for we know very well, that all the Kingdoms upon the Earth have oftentimes chang'd their Maſters and Families.</p>
                  <p>But if he means, as ſurely he muſt, if he mean any thing, that we cannot name any ſuch Kingdom or Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that hath been ſo begun, then he is groſly miſtaken: for, the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi>

the <hi>Medes,</hi> the <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> or <hi>Cuſoei,</hi> the <hi>Lydians,</hi> the <hi>Jones,</hi> or <hi>Greeks,</hi> and very many others, are ſufficiently known, and preſerve to this day the very names of their firſt Founders; who (as is made appear) were all Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of Families.</p>

                  <p>And firſt, <hi>Juſtin</hi> makes no Scruple to call him in plain Words a King. <hi>Poſt Damaſcum Azillus, Mox Adores, &amp; Abraham &amp; Iſrael, Reges fuere. lib. 36.

                  <p>Then he introduceth <hi>Samuel</hi> upon the Stage, chiefly I ſuppoſe, to inſinuate, that the People had a <hi>Power,</hi> and did <hi>chooſe</hi> themſelves a King: which is ſo notoriouſly falſe, that they never had the leaſt ſhare, or pretended any in the election of <hi>Saul.</hi> It is true they choſe rather to be govern'd by a temporal King, who was to live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, and rule as other Kings did, than continue under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the King of Heaven and Earth; and ſo the Word <hi>choſe</hi> relates wholly to the <hi>Government,</hi> but not to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:53230:63"/>
of the Governour. For which, <hi>Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> alſo reproves them, and accordingly they acted no farther, leaving the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of their new King wholly to God, and their Prophet, and God did particularly chooſe him from the reſt of their People, and <hi>Samuel</hi> actually anointed him before the People knew any thing of the matter.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards, leſt ſome might have accus'd <hi>Samuel</hi> of Partiality in the Choice, he order'd <hi>Lots</hi> to be caſt, which in the Interpretation of all men, is, leaving the Election to God; and <hi>Saul</hi> was again taken. What <hi>Junius Brutus,</hi> another <hi>old antimonarchical ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious Brother,</hi> objects concerning <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing</hi> the Kingdom at <hi>Gilgal,</hi> where it is ſaid, <hi>And all the People went to</hi> Gilgal, <hi>and there they made</hi> Saul <hi>King before the Lord,</hi> will ſerve very little to prove any Right of Power in the People, no not ſo much as of Election: for <hi>confirming</hi> and <hi>renewing</hi> the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and ſuch like Expreſſions, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie no more, than the <hi>taking</hi> by us the <hi>Oaths of Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Supremacy,</hi>
                     <pb n="110" facs="tcp:53230:64"/>
which I think were never thought to give the King any Right to the Crown, but only a juſt Right to puniſh us for our <hi>Perjury</hi> as well as <hi>Diſobedience,</hi> in Caſe of Rebellion. So <hi>renewing</hi> the <hi>Covenant with God,</hi> as particularly a little before the Death of <hi>Joſhuah,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſuppoſed to give a greater right of Power to God Almighty, than what he had before, but is only a ſtricter Obligation for the Peoples Obedience, that they might be condemned out of their own Mouths. <hi>And</hi> Joſhuah <hi>ſaid unto the People, See ye are Witneſſes againſt your ſelves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So <hi>Samuel</hi> makes the People bind themſelves to God, to their King, and to their Prophet, that they would faithfully obey him whom the Lord had ſet over them. <hi>And behold, ſaith</hi> Samuel, <hi>the Lord hath ſet a King over you.</hi> But having ſpoke more to this purpoſe elſewhere, and the Caſe being moſt clear, as well by the Hiſtory it ſelf, as by the Authority of <hi>Grotius,</hi> and other learned Men, that <hi>Saul</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Kings, did not

in the leaſt depend upon their People, but received all their Right of Power wholly from God, we will proceed with our Author.

                  </p>

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:53230:65"/>
Fooling</hi> in any Author beſides himſelf. But we will examine his Reaſoning, and his <hi>Aphoriſm,</hi> as fully and impartially as we can. And in the firſt place it is moſt neceſſary that we ſhould <hi>define</hi> the Word <hi>Imperium,</hi> which ſurely we cannot do more plainly, than when we ſay, That <hi>Imperium eſt jus Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perandi,</hi> Empire is a Right of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. Now that this Right of Command ſhould be fix'd or found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon what in it ſelf is incapable of receiving any Command, or pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Obedience, I mean <hi>Land,</hi> is ſo abſurd a Propoſition, that it makes Empire an empty Name on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and Sound: for when you thunder your Imperial Laws through your hollow Rocks, your ſhady Groves, and Woods, thoſe <hi>ſtiff</hi> and <hi>ſtately</hi> Subjects of your new found Empire, will pay no other Homage or Obedience, than a Return of your Commands upon your own <hi>Royal Head,</hi> by the Repetition of a fooliſh Eccho, the only <hi>Subject</hi>
                     <pb n="114" facs="tcp:53230:66"/>
which can entertain you with Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
                  <p>You, in the mean time, muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main like <hi>Midas,</hi> amidſt his Gold, without Service or Suſtenance, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept being wholly transform'd into an <hi>Aſs,</hi> or grazing, like <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezar,</hi> amidſt your fertile Paſtures, you might indeed in ſuch caſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a <hi>fat and luſty,</hi> though a <hi>beaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> Emperour.</p>

                  <p>Let us ſuppoſe then, that the King ſhould make ſome Nobleman or Gentleman, Duke or Prince, or (if you will) Emperour of ſome vaſt tract of Land, in the <hi>Weſtern Part</hi> of <hi>Terra Auſtralis incognita;</hi> which we will alſo imagine totally uninhabited.

                  <p>So it may, Sir, but this will not do our Buſineſs; for, his Empire, in that caſe, will not be founded upon the <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> of his <hi>Land,</hi> but the Perſons of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who become naturally his <hi>Subjects,</hi> even when he did not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs one <hi>Acre</hi> of Land.

                  <p>'Tis true, the Civil Law, for the Good of all, has reduc'd even Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers themſelves under the Civil Government, who is ſtill <hi>Pater Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trioe.</hi> But, naturally, every Father is Emperour in his own Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>

tell you, that it is more rational to affirm, That a Man may be an Emperour without <hi>Land,</hi> than with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>People.</hi> So many of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Generals were called Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, when they had little to fix their Empire on, beſides their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>And, to comply with our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's Country Compariſon of a

                  <p>Whence it is eaſie to infer, That Empire is always founded upon <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Bodies,</hi> and not upon <hi>Lands</hi> or <hi>Things inſenſible.</hi>

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:53230:73"/>
That <hi>Empire conſiſts in holding this Government</hi> or <hi>Power,</hi> as <hi>Grotius</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes it, <hi>In pleno Jure proprieta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> or, <hi>In patrimonio imperantis,</hi> that is <hi>properly,</hi> or <hi>in Property,</hi> or in <hi>chief,</hi> or how elſe you pleaſe to render theſe Words in <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Which <hi>Grotius,</hi> in the ſame Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, explains, by a <hi>Jus regendi, non aliunde pendens.</hi> A <hi>Right of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment not depending upon any other humane Authority whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</hi>

                  <p>But, Sir, ſince you have founded Empire upon a Supreme Right of Government or Power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Men, how comes it to paſs that we find a Right of Power, and Priviledges, and Government too, ſo founded in <hi>the Poſſeſſion</hi> of <hi>ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Lands,</hi> that the <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> of <hi>thoſe Lands</hi> alone gives a Man ſeveral Rights and Prerogatives.</p>
                  <p>For example, amongſt us 'tis ſaid, That whoſoever hath the Right and Poſſeſſion of the Barony of <hi>Burgaveny,</hi> beſides ſome others,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:53230:73"/>
becomes thereby a Baron of <hi>England,</hi> and enjoys thoſe Priviledges which belong to it.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>France</hi> I have heard ſay, That nothing is more common than for Men to receive their <hi>Titles</hi> according to their <hi>Lands,</hi> whether Count, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, Marqueſs, and ſo forth.</p>
                  <p>Is it not plain then, That the Right of Command or Power, which is Empire, may be founded upon <hi>Property,</hi> according to our Author's Interpretation, that is, the <hi>Poſſeſſion of Lands?</hi>

                  <p>I agree to what you have urg'd; that is to ſay, That ſeveral Priviledges, and Right of Power, are annexed to ſeveral Lordſhips or <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res Nobles,</hi> that they have thereby <hi>haute &amp; baſſe Juſtice;</hi> and their Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction extends to <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death.</hi> Nay more, in ſeveral parts of <hi>Italy,</hi> and particularly in <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardy,</hi> there are ſeveral <hi>Imperial Feuds,</hi> which <hi>Grotius</hi> ſeems to call <hi>Regna Feudalia,</hi> which have almoſt

                  <p>Becauſe all thoſe little Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, or Principalities, whether they were inſtituted at firſt by the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> or <hi>Lombards,</hi> or grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed afterwards by ſeveral later Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours and Kings, or <hi>both,</hi> as is moſt probable, yet they did, and ſtill do, at this day, depend upon a <hi>Superiour Power,</hi> and pay <hi>Homage</hi> and <hi>Fealty</hi> for thoſe Priviledges which they enjoy; which is much different from Empire, or a <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Right of Power.</hi> And yet, even in this Caſe, this ſubordinate Power is ſo far from being founded upon the <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> of all the <hi>Land</hi> belonging to the <hi>Feud,</hi> which is our Author's Propoſition, that very
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:53230:74"/>
often their Liberties depend only upon the <hi>old Walls of a ruinated Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie,</hi> and a <hi>very inconſiderable Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Acres,</hi> which <hi>repreſent the whole Feud,</hi> or Mannor, the reſt of the Land having been ſold away, and become the <hi>Property</hi> of others, ſome ſmall Rent only, or Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment, being reſerv'd.

                     <hi>Couſin,</hi> I have heard, and read too, I think, that the Sea hath formerly eaten up a conſiderable part of <hi>your ancient</hi> Patrimony, and from thence, it may be, you are no Friend to Lands. But, for my part, I will ſtand up for Land as long as I can; and muſt therefore ask you,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:53230:75"/>
Why thoſe Rents or Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were reſerv'd, if not to teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, that they came originally from the Lord, and that thereby he ſtill keeps up a kind of Sovereign Right to the <hi>Lands</hi> themſelves; knowing well enough, that his <hi>Power,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our Author, is <hi>founded</hi> upon <hi>them.</hi>

                  <p>This yet ſignifies nothing: for although the Reſervation of theſe Rents or Services do preſerve the Memory of the Benefactor, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the Reſpect due from the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, yet this is <hi>perſonal</hi> only, and hath no Relation to the <hi>publick Right</hi> of Power or Government.</p>
                  <p>For, when this Rent was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, yet whoſoever lives within the Juriſdiction of ſuch a Fewd or Mannor, is always ſubject to him, who enjoys the Lordſhip.</p>
                  <p>So in <hi>England, Services</hi> and <hi>Quit-Rents</hi> have been generally <hi>receiv'd</hi> and <hi>paid,</hi> untill the late King, and his preſent Majeſty, were pleas'd to diſpoſe of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="133" facs="tcp:53230:75"/>But to believe that this hath leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened his <hi>Sovereign Right of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> is a Fancy that ſure cannot enter into the Head of any ſober Man. But let us put a plain Caſe.</p>
                  <p>Suppoſe the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> were at any time obtain'd by abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute <hi>Conqueſt,</hi> as I conceive it was more than once, and that ſuch <hi>Conqueſt</hi> gives the Conquerour a <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Right,</hi> not only to our <hi>real</hi> and <hi>perſonal</hi> Eſtates, which we find to have been wholly in the hands of ſome of our Kings, but alſo over our <hi>Liberties</hi> and <hi>Lives,</hi> as may be fully ſeen in <hi>Grotius, de Jur.

                  </p>
                  <p>Now, Sir, ſuppoſing a People in this Condition, and having nothing of their own, ſubmit themſelves, and <hi>all</hi> they have, to the <hi>Mercy</hi> of the Conquerour, as the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> did to the <hi>Romans,</hi> you will grant, I imagine, that this Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour is an Emperour to all Intents, having an <hi>abſolute Right of Power</hi> over the <hi>People</hi> and their <hi>Land</hi> alſo.</p>

                  <p>But we will farther ſuppoſe, That our Conquerour (being of a more noble, and more humane Temper, than, it may be, our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor would have been) orders dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent <hi>Inquiſition</hi> to be made into the Value of his <hi>conquer'd Lands.</hi> Which being done, and enter'd into a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter, ſuch as we call <hi>Doomſday</hi> Book, the Conquerour divides moſt of theſe Lands between the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and the Conquered; ſome he returns to their former Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, upon certain Conditions or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices; others he changeth. To his <hi>Noblemen</hi> and <hi>Favourites</hi> he grants <hi>great Titles</hi> and <hi>Priviledges,</hi> to the Gentry leſs, and to the <hi>vulgar</hi> or <hi>common ſort,</hi> ſome ſmall <hi>Poſſeſſions,</hi> which with a little Labour and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, will enable them to live ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:53230:76"/>
and peaceably the reſt of their days.</p>
                  <p>All theſe become an Inheritance to themſelves and their Heirs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their ſeveral <hi>Tenures,</hi> (which the Conquerours have gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally created) and which we call <hi>Property.</hi> Theſe, Sir, being thus eſtabliſhed, and the Lands of the Kingdom ſetled after this manner, the Conquerour or King himſelf reſerves, it may be, a ſmall part, which we call <hi>Crown Lands;</hi> and in Conſideration of his <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,</hi> and thoſe <hi>Benefits</hi> which he hath beſtowed upon his People, in granting them their <hi>Liberties, Lives,</hi> and <hi>Lands,</hi> he continueth to himſelf the <hi>Power of making and aboliſhing Laws,</hi> according as he ſhall think moſt fit, and proper for the <hi>Peace, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> and <hi>Safety</hi> of his Government.

                  <p>Sir, not to loſe Time, I ſhall begin with the firſt, That <hi>it is not reaſonable, that thoſe who have the greateſt Intereſt in the Property, ſhould have any Right of Power in the Government,</hi> except what is ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate and deriv'd from the ſupream Magiſtrate.</p>
                  <p>To prove this, we muſt make theſe two general Diſtinctions, which are, and ever were in all Governments
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:53230:80"/>
whatever: That is to ſay, between the <hi>Governour</hi> and the <hi>Governed,</hi> which muſt of neceſſity be <hi>two dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent</hi> Perſons: for, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves in his Introduction to the Lives of <hi>Agis</hi> and <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> one Man cannot be <hi>Maſter</hi> and <hi>Servant,</hi> nor can he who commands be able at the ſame Time to obey. So <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> tells us, <hi>Quod cogens &amp; coactum requirunt diſtinctas perſonas, neque ſufficiunt diſtincti reſpectus.</hi> I never heard but that the <hi>People</hi> were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways taken for the <hi>Governed.</hi> To moderate and regulate whoſe unruly Paſſions and inclinations, Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it ſelf has been hitherto conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in the World, and they are generally call'd the <hi>Body</hi> of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. The Governour has been ever underſtood to be a <hi>ſingle Perſon,</hi> or <hi>Counſel,</hi> or <hi>more,</hi> who are likewiſe properly call'd the <hi>Head.</hi> Both form the <hi>Body Politick.</hi> Right of Power is like the <hi>Soul,</hi> and is ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>Head;</hi> whence diſperſing itsvital Heat, through proper Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:53230:81"/>
and Veins, it nouriſheth and gives Motion to all the Body, and every part of it. The <hi>Body</hi> thereby is enabled to preſerve the <hi>Head</hi> from Violence. The <hi>Head</hi> alone commands, and the <hi>Body</hi> performs. The <hi>Body</hi> cannot command, nor hath the <hi>Head</hi> any Action, nor can it poſſibly obey. The <hi>Head</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the <hi>Body</hi> deſtroys both.</p>
                  <p>Mark, that <hi>Right of Power,</hi> which is Empire, hath no other <hi>Object</hi> or <hi>Subject</hi> than the <hi>Body,</hi> and in its Exerciſe, is properly and ſolely founded thereupon. The <hi>Body</hi> part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the <hi>Head,</hi> is no more a <hi>Body,</hi> but a <hi>Carcaſs.</hi> And the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> without a Supreme Governour, is no more a <hi>People,</hi> but a confus'd deform'd, and unactive <hi>Multitude.</hi> Mark, that the <hi>People</hi> have no Life, nor Power, nor Motion, but what they receive from the <hi>Head.</hi> This is the conſtant Doctrine of the moſt Learned Authors who have ever treated of Government.</p>

                  <p>They may ſo, Sir, and ever might ſince the Beginning of <hi>Bodies,</hi> and ever may whilſt <hi>Bodies</hi> continue in the World; no matter whether they be <hi>fat</hi> or <hi>lean.</hi> But the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence alſo ever was, and ever will be, Confuſion, Diſſolution, and the Deſtruction of both.</p>
                  <p>This puts me in mind of a Fable which <hi>Plutarch</hi> relates in the Life of <hi>Agis,</hi> King of <hi>Sparta;</hi> which if our Author would have impartially conſider'd, it might have ſtop'd the furious Current of his <hi>Popular Pen.</hi> The Story is this:</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Serpent's Tail,</hi> who had been ever us'd to follow its imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Head,</hi> grew weary, at length, of this ſervile Complaiſance, diſputes the <hi>Precedency;</hi> and having brought the <hi>Body</hi> into its pernicious Faction, the <hi>triumphant Tail</hi> begins to take the place, and <hi>marches firſt.</hi> But being no ways qualified for that Government which it had <hi>uſurp'd,</hi> it train'd the <hi>Head</hi> through Thorns and Briars, through Waters, and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:53230:83"/>
down Precipices; till having totally blinded and <hi>diſabled the Head,</hi> and the Tail no ways able to ſupport its Life, <hi>both</hi> became a Prey, and were ſwallow'd up by a <hi>Vultur,</hi> who had watch'd the fatal Conſequence of this <hi>unnatural</hi> and <hi>irregular</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>You ſee here the Effect of <hi>Force</hi> againſt a <hi>Right of Power;</hi> which, ſince it comes in my way, it is moſt neceſſary we ſhould diſtinguiſh: for <hi>Power,</hi> by Abuſe, is become, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, another of our Authors <hi>equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal</hi> Words.</p>
                  <p>All <hi>Power</hi> came originally from God Almighty; for, <hi>There is no Power but of God, the Powers that be are ordained of God,</hi> Rom. 13. 1. which muſt be always underſtood a <hi>Right of Power;</hi> for God doth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Violence</hi> nor <hi>Wrong. Namque odit ipſe vim Deus.</hi> And if ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we have ſeen Violence and Force prevail againſt <hi>Power,</hi> which is a <hi>juſt Authority,</hi> it is only a mark of <hi>Permiſſion</hi> in the Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:53230:83"/>
as a Puniſhment for Sin, not of <hi>Approbation. Narratur in teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monium divinae Providentioe id per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittentis, non in facti humani appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bationem.</hi> Theſe are the Words of <hi>Grotius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Body</hi> Politick is compos'd of <hi>Men,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Duſt</hi> and <hi>Clay,</hi> without Form or Action, untill God breath'd into his Noſtrils the <hi>Breath of Power,</hi> and it became a living Soul.</p>
                  <p>Power then is a <hi>Ray</hi> of the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity it ſelf. And notwithſtanding the inſolent Mockery of our Atheiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, conceited Author, where there is a <hi>Sovereign Right of Power</hi> there is <hi>Jus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </p>
                  <p>So when God, at the Requeſt of <hi>Moſes</hi> who was unable to govern ſo great a People without <hi>ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Officers,</hi> inſtituted the Court of the <hi>Sanhedrim.</hi> God took of the <hi>Spirit</hi> that was upon <hi>Moſes,</hi> and gave it to the <hi>ſeventy Elders,</hi> which was this <hi>Right of Power,</hi> and they began to propheſie; a conſtant mark
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:53230:84"/>
of this <hi>Right of Power,</hi> which they deriv'd from <hi>Moſes,</hi> and was ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate as generally the <hi>Conſtitutum</hi> is to the <hi>Conſtituens.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So when <hi>Saul</hi> was anointed King as a Mark of his undoubted Right of Power, he propheſied amongſt the Prophets. So again, when <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> growing old, deſir'd that God would ſet a <hi>Man over the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> that <hi>they might not be as Sheep without a Shepherd,</hi> the Lord ſaid unto <hi>Moſes, Take</hi> Joſhuah <hi>the Son of</hi> Nun, <hi>and lay</hi> thy <hi>Hands upon him, and thou ſhalt put ſome of</hi> thine <hi>Honour upon him, that all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>may be obedient.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What ſhould all the Congregation of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> be obedient to, but to the Commands of <hi>Joſhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> who had received this Right of Command, which is Power and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, immediately from the <hi>Hands</hi> of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Power then is the <hi>Soul</hi> of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, receiv'd from God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:53230:84"/>
It is a <hi>Spirit</hi> which gives Life to the <hi>Body,</hi> but not the <hi>Body</hi> it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Power is like that nouriſhing <hi>Heat</hi> and <hi>Light</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> which we are ſenſible of by its Effects, that is, its <hi>Influence</hi> upon all ſublunary Bodies, by its <hi>Attraction, Reverbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> or <hi>Tranſmiſſion</hi> through pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Vehicles.</hi> Not by contact of the Body.</p>
                  <p>Nay, we are aſſur'd, that the <hi>Aether,</hi> which is nearer the Sun, is <hi>dark.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Power ſhews it ſelf by its <hi>Effects,</hi> that is, Government, which it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces by <hi>Tranſmiſſion</hi> alſo of its <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence</hi> through proper <hi>Vehicles,</hi> which are <hi>ſubordinate Officers,</hi> whom it <hi>animates</hi> and <hi>inſpires.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Power is <hi>inviſible, incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, eternal: Power never dyes,</hi> and in its original it is <hi>Omnipotency,</hi> which is <hi>God.</hi> And when God himſelf had inveſted <hi>Moſes</hi> with this Power, he was pleas'd to tell him, That <hi>he ſhould be unto his Brother</hi> Aaron <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a God.</hi>

                  <p>Sir, I am much pleas'd with this Deſcription which you have given of Power. And indeed, ſince Government is one of the greateſt and moſt neceſſary Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings which Mankind enjoys, that Government cannot ſubſiſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Power,</hi> and that <hi>Power</hi> is ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally in God, who is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all <hi>Power,</hi> nothing ſeems more reaſonable, than that we ſhould deduce all humane Authority from that inexhauſtible <hi>Source,</hi> and reſpect it accordingly.</p>
                  <p>I have only one Argument againſt what you have propos'd; which, however it may ſeem ſtrange, yet I muſt beg leave to offer it to you. And it is this, That I have heard ſome Learned Men, both <hi>Ancient</hi> and <hi>Modern,</hi> ſeem to maintain, That although God may poſſibly be the univerſal Governour of the World, or governs the Univerſe in general, as the <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi> and <hi>Stars,</hi> and ſo forth, yet that he doth not, (as being beneath ſo
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:53230:85"/>
great a Majeſty) inſpect or mind the little particular Governments of our ſmall Globe of Earth.</p>

                  <speaker>Trav.</speaker>
                  <p>This is, indeed, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Doctrine of the <hi>Epicureans;</hi> which, with its Diſciples, ought to be baniſh'd all good Governments, <hi>Qui ex bene moratis urbibus eje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti ſunt,</hi> as <hi>Grotius</hi> tells us, <hi>cap. de poenis. Ita &amp; coerceri poſſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitror, nomine humanae Societatis, quam ſine ratione probabili vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant.</hi>

                     <hi>Gaſſendus,</hi> I confeſs, in his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe <hi>de Vita &amp; Moribus Epicuri,</hi> ſeems too much to favour this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. But <hi>Grotius,</hi> whoſe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I prefer before the Philoſophy of both; and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> whom we Chriſtians ought to reſpect before all three, tells us, <hi>Heb. 11. v.</hi> 6. That <hi>he who cometh to God, muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he is, and that he is a Rewarder of thoſe who diligently ſearch him. Grotius</hi> alſo, in the ſame Chapter, ſays farther, That
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:53230:86"/>
                     <hi>that Religion which in all Ages has been accounted true, is chiefly ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon four Principles;</hi> the third of which he ſays is this, <hi>That God takes Care of humane Affairs,</hi> and <hi>determines them according to his moſt juſt Decrees, à Deo curari res hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manas &amp; aequiſſimis Judiciis dijudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cari.</hi> And after he hath quoted, to the ſame purpoſe, <hi>Cicero, Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctetus, Lactantius,</hi> and others, he concludes, That <hi>Revera negare De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um eſſe, aut negare à Deo curari actiones humanas, ſi moralem effectum reſpicimus, tantundem valet. That to deny there is a God, or to deny that he regulates humane Affairs, is in Effect the ſame thing.</hi> And parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in the ſame Chapter, <hi>Sect.</hi> 44. he tells us farther, that <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus, when he took away the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, in the Government of the World, he left nothing of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, but the empty Name. That Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice is no farther neceſſary than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, and that we ought to abſtain from hurting one another, out of no
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:53230:86"/>
other Conſideration, than the Fear that thoſe, whom we offend, ſhould revenge themſelves. Epicurus cum Divinam providentiam ſuſtuliſſet, Juſtitiae quoque nihil reliquit niſi no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men inane,</hi> &amp;c. But theſe, and many other of the <hi>Epicurean</hi> Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, are rather <hi>plauſible</hi> than <hi>ſolid, witty</hi> than <hi>judicious,</hi> and ſtriking the <hi>Senſes,</hi> are rejected by a <hi>ſober <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</hi>

                  <p>Beſides, <hi>Couſin,</hi> we Chriſtians are obliged by a truer, and much more Divine, Philoſophy; to which, we have all ſubſerib'd, and which is become a publick Law and Rule amongſt us: and with good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for nothing is more dangerous in all Governments, than to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late <hi>Publick Actions</hi> according to <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Opinions.</hi>

                  <p>Having told you then, what <hi>Power</hi> is, I come now to <hi>Force;</hi> and as the firſt is the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual part of Government, ſo the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is the material part. <hi>Force</hi> is the <hi>Arm</hi> and <hi>Nerve,</hi> which being animated by lawful Authority, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces <hi>Power</hi> in the general Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, which is properly, and in a good Senſe, the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of both. Force,</hi> without this <hi>Right, is, Vis injuſta,</hi> or Violence. With it, it becomes the <hi>juſt Defence,</hi> which Nature hath given all Creatures, as well as Man, to preſerve to themſelves their <hi>Lives, Liberties,</hi> and <hi>Poſſeſſions.</hi> Without it, that is, when we invade the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:53230:87"/>
Poſſeſſions of another, it becomes <hi>Robbery</hi> and <hi>Rapine,</hi> and is no more excuſable in <hi>Alexander</hi> than the Pyrate. <hi>Tully de Officiis</hi> 3. and <hi>Grotius,</hi> who cites him, beſides ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, tell us the ſame Truths in plain Words, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t quiſque malit ſibi, quod ad vitae uſum pertineat, quam alteri acquiri, conceſſum eſt, non repugnante natura. Illud natura non patitur, ut aliorum ſpoliis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtras facultates, opes, copias augea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi> And <hi>Grotius</hi> adds this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, <hi>Non eſt ergo contra Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis naturam, ſibi proſpicere atque conſulere, dum jus alienum non tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latur. Ac proinde, nec vis, quae jus alterius non violat, injuſta eſt.</hi> It is <hi>Right of Power</hi> therefore, which makes <hi>Force juſtifiable,</hi> both accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Laws of Nature, and the Laws of Man.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, Power or Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Force, are generally ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that they oftentimes are mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, and paſs for one another. But they are alſo ſometimes ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:53230:88"/>
as a <hi>Right</hi> may be from the <hi>Poſſeſſion,</hi> and by this Inſtance we may eaſily diſtinguiſh them. A law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Prince hath <hi>firſt Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> to which <hi>Force</hi> is added.

                  <speaker>Trav.</speaker>
                  <p>Having then made theſe neceſſary Diſtinctions, I affirm, That the People, (which is the <hi>Force</hi> and <hi>Strength</hi> of all Kingdoms) by how much their Strength is <hi>great,</hi> (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Land, or Perſonal <hi>Eſtate</hi>) by ſo much their Power, which is Authority, or Right of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ought to be the <hi>leſs.</hi> And this not only becauſe it is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous and unnatural, that the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned</hi> ſhould become their own <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours,</hi> or that the ſeveral deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Appetites of the Members ſhould train after them, the <hi>Reaſon</hi>
                     <pb n="159" facs="tcp:53230:88"/>
which ought to regulate all; but it is alſo very imprudent, and againſt all the Rules of true Polity and Government. For it hath been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Rule and Endeavour of wiſe Men, ſo to ballance <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Force,</hi> that neither may offend the other, but that by the harmonious Accord of juſt <hi>Commands,</hi> and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Obedience,</hi> a State may become moſt <hi>happy, invincible,</hi> and <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Power never ought to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume an <hi>adventitious</hi> Force, ſuch as <hi>Mercenary Souldiers,</hi> which have generally prov'd deſtructive both to Prince and People; nor the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> uſurp a Power, which belongs not to them; ſuch as the <hi>Seditious Tribunes</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> often pretended to, which loſt them both that <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> which they had. Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment conſiſts in <hi>Command</hi> and <hi>Obedience;</hi> whence Empire is defin'd by ſome to be <hi>certus ordo in jubendo &amp; parendo.</hi> Command is the <hi>Effect</hi> of Power, Obedience the <hi>Reſult</hi> of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:53230:89"/>
both, and Peace, Happineſs, and Security, the <hi>end of all.</hi> The ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Interruption proceeds from want of due Obedience; the ſole Conſideration of their Force makes Men dare to diſobey.</p>
                  <p>What then can be more irrational and abſurd, than that the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour ſhould, by granting a <hi>Right of Power,</hi> countenance their <hi>Violence;</hi> and by giving a pretence to <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience,</hi> make it more difficult, if not impoſſible, for himſelf to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern. It is like uncurbing, or lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Reins upon the Necks of headſtrong Horſes; which is againſt the Reaſon and Practice of all good Governments upon Earth.</p>
                  <p>Were the <hi>Beaſts</hi> well tempered, it were yet more practicable; but by how much their Strength is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, by ſo much a ſtricter Hand ought to be kept over them.</p>
                  <p>What wiſe Pilot would ever truſt the Helm into the Hands of an inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>Crew</hi> of Mariners? Or, What prudent Prince would ſubmit his

Scepter to the Will of <hi>arrogant Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi> whoſe Wills they themſelves declare to be, to <hi>govern equally,</hi> if not <hi>ſuperiour</hi> to the King.</p>
                  <p>If our Author had meant a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Power we would eaſily have agreed; and I think there are few People, under Heaven, who enjoy a larger Proportion of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable and honourable Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, than our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subjects do.

                  <p>But in the next place, by having the Poſſeſſion of theſe Lands ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, they are not more enabled to uſurp this Power than if they had them not: for, the <hi>Strength</hi> of all Governments being eternally in the <hi>Perſons of the Governed,</hi> whether they be <hi>rich,</hi> or whether they be
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:53230:90"/>
                     <hi>poor,</hi> it muſt follow, that when they pleaſe to rebell, no Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or Governours whatever under Heaven, can of themſelves poſſibly reduce them: for the Number is even in the moſt popular Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>ten thouſand</hi> of the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> to <hi>one</hi> that <hi>governs.</hi> And this is a natural, irreſiſtible <hi>Inequality</hi> of Strength, which even in their natural, naked Eſtate, without other Arms than ſuch as Nature hath given all Creatures, according to their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Kinds, puts them always in a Condition to deſtroy the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when they pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>You muſt not urge, that a great Number may probably preſerve their Obedience, and follow the Party of the Governours. For it is already ſuppos'd in our Caſe, that the greater Number, having the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the Lands, <hi>muſt</hi> and <hi>will</hi> ſhare the Government.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="164" facs="tcp:53230:91"/>
                     <hi>Might,</hi> indeed, if put in Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, will ever be too hard for <hi>Right,</hi> and <hi>May</hi> and <hi>Ought</hi> can never ſtand againſt the Torrent of <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Muſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This needs no farther Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration: Ten Servants in a Family will eaſily turn their Maſter out of Doors, though they have not the <hi>Propriety</hi> of <hi>one foot of Land</hi> upon the Earth.</p>
                  <p>Examples we need not. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ſince our Author hath fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd us with one, as he hath done many others againſt himſelf, I ſhall mind you of it.</p>

which he calls a <hi>Mercenary Army,</hi> and not his natural Subjects. But could he introduce his <hi>Timariots</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the places of thoſe <hi>Janizaries, this horrid Flaw, and Inconvenience in the Government, had been wholly avoided.</hi>

                  <p>Sir, I can very hardly grant you this Point, it being one of our ſtrongeſt Holds, which we muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend to the laſt Drop of Blood. I muſt tell you therefore, that though the greateſt Number, ſuch as I muſt own is ever compos'd of the <hi>People,</hi> be always capable of <hi>uſurping</hi> the Government, over the <hi>Governour,</hi> who is indeed no more than a <hi>ſingle Man</hi> againſt a whole <hi>Nation</hi> in point of <hi>Strength;</hi> yet whilſt the <hi>Tenures</hi> are preſerv'd, ſuch as were formerly in <hi>England,</hi> the Prince had a ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Tye upon the People, than when having relinquiſh'd them, he hath no other Obligation upon them than his <hi>Parchment Right of Power,</hi> and, if you pleaſe, their <hi>Oaths of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;</hi> both which are <hi>cancell'd</hi> in a Moment, while the <hi>Lands remain eternally</hi> in the <hi>People.</hi>

                  <speaker>Trav.</speaker>
                  <p>I have already told you, That <hi>publick Right</hi> of Government, or if you will, the <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>publick</hi> Government, doth not in the leaſt depend upon <hi>Tenures:</hi> for they are only particular <hi>Services</hi> and <hi>Royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> which Princes have ſometimes thought good to reſerve to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, more or leſs, according as they alone have thought fit, and may be alter'd or relinquiſh'd, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diminiſhing their <hi>Publick Right</hi> of Government over the Nation, they being ſuch as regard rather the <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Perſon</hi> of the King, as Lord of a Mannor, than his <hi>Politick Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> as <hi>Supreme</hi> Magiſtrate, or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the State. And indeed, many of theſe Services and Tenures were rather very inconvenient and burthenſome to the People than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial to the Government.</p>
                  <p>Many ſuch were anciently known in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> as well as <hi>France.</hi> Amongſt others, what was more inhumane, than that the Lord ſhould have a Right to <hi>lye</hi> with his
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:53230:94"/>
                     <hi>Tenants Wife</hi> the firſt Night they married: which in <hi>France</hi> they call <hi>Droit de Jambage.</hi> Some Services were very ridiculous, and ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant. So I have heard of a <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> by which the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is oblig'd, at certain Times, to drive a <hi>Cart</hi> with <hi>twelve Oxen</hi> round the Court of the Mannor Houſe. In which time, if any of the Oxen hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to <hi>dung</hi> in the <hi>Court,</hi> the <hi>Cart,</hi> with the <hi>twelve Oxen,</hi> was forfeited to the Lord of the Mannor: but if none of the <hi>Oxen</hi> ſhould <hi>dung,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they were driven out of the <hi>Court,</hi> then the Lord was to receive only <hi>one Egg.</hi> Now how do theſe and many other ſuch Services, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to a Right of Government? So many Mannors were held of the King, to accompany him in his <hi>Wars</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> or in <hi>France,</hi> or elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; ſome were obliged to carry his <hi>Spear,</hi> ſome his <hi>Sword,</hi> others his <hi>Helmet,</hi> and ſuch like, which are all merely <hi>private</hi> Obligations, and which any private Man might
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:53230:94"/>
reſerve, upon conſideration of <hi>Lands</hi> given.</p>
                  <p>It is true, the King had then a ſtronger Tye upon <hi>particular</hi> Perſons, than ſince he hath releaſed them. But this, I ſay, hath no influence upon his <hi>Publick</hi> Right of Power; for the Supreme Magiſtrate is always (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding any ſuch Releaſe) <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter both of our Eſtates and Perſons, as far as they are neceſſary, for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Government.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So you ſee Care is taken that all Lands ſhall pay their <hi>Quotas</hi> towards <hi>Horſes</hi> and <hi>Footmen,</hi> which is in uſe at this day; which Forces ſo paid, we call the <hi>Militia.</hi> His Majeſty may <hi>preſs Souldiers,</hi> and by the Conſent of his great Council, the Parliament, charge our <hi>Eſtates</hi> and <hi>Perſons</hi> with ſuch Sums as ſhall be thought expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for the Occaſion. And this brings me to the third Point, which is, That <hi>all Sovereign Princes have a Right of Power over the Lands, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Property be divided amongſt the People.</hi> And this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:53230:95"/>
from the <hi>Dominium Superemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nens,</hi> which is eternally in all <hi>Supreme</hi> Magiſtrates or Magiſtrate whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; whoſe Duty it is to look after, and by all means ſecure, the Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the <hi>Whole,</hi> in which every particular is involv'd. Nor is it a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Objection, to ſay, That Laws or Impoſitions may lye very heavy upon particular Men, if ſuch an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Power ſhould reſt in any Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: for Laws cannot be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways made ſo eaſie, but that Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may happen, which may make them ſeem very hard to ſome, <hi>Id modò quoeritur, ſi majori parti, &amp; in ſummo proſint.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence <hi>Grotius,</hi> from <hi>Thucydides,</hi> remarks an excellent Paſſage of <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> to this purpoſe: <hi>Sic exiſtimo,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>etiam ſingulis hominibus plus eam prodeſſe civitatem, quoe tota rectè ſe habeat, quam ſi privatis floreat uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litatibus, ipſa autem univerſim laboret. Qui enim domeſticas fortunas bene col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locatas habet, patria tamen everſa, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reat &amp; ipſe neceſſe eſt,</hi> &amp;c. All which,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:53230:95"/>
                     <hi>Livy</hi> thus briefly expreſſes; <hi>Reſpub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica incolumis, &amp; privatas res ſalvas facile proeſtat. Publica prodendo, tua nequicquam ſerves. That whilſt the Commonwealth is ſafe in general, our particular Concerns may be alſo eaſily ſecur'd. But by deſerting the publick Intereſt of the Nation, we do thereby no ways preſerve our own.</hi> Nothing, therefore, ſeems more reaſonable, and indeed neceſſary, than that the Government ſhould have always a Power, to <hi>compell</hi> every <hi>particular Subject,</hi> who ſtanding upon their <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Rights</hi> and <hi>Properties,</hi> would thereby ſuffer the <hi>Whole</hi> to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd.</p>
                  <p>For, though naturally every Man hath a Right to maintain what is his own, and by conſequence might op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe whoſoever would endeavour to take his Property from him; yet <hi>Grotius</hi> tells us, That <hi>Government, which is inſtituted for the publick Tranquillity of the Whole, or,</hi> Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillitas publica in qua &amp; ſingulorum continetur, <hi>acquires thereby a more
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:53230:96"/>

                        </gap>ver our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as well as Poſſeſſions, than we our ſelves can pretend to;</hi> that is, <hi>as far as ſhall be neceſſary for obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that great end of publick Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> Civili ſocietate ad tuendam Tranquillitatem inſtituta, ſtatim ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitati jus quoddam majus, in nos &amp; noſtra naſcitur, quatenus ad finem illum id neceſſarium eſt. Whence <hi>Seneca</hi> obſerves, That the <hi>Power of all is ever in the Supreme Magiſtrate, but the Property remains, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, in the Hands of particular Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. Ad Reges</hi> Poteſtas <hi>omnium pertinet, ad ſingulos</hi> Proprietas. And ſo, as hath been ſaid, the King in Parliament hath a Right to diſpoſe of our Eſtates and Perſons as ſhall be thought neceſſary for our publick Security. And where Sovereign Princes act without Parliaments, they have in themſelves the ſame Authority.</p>
                  <p>I have ſpoke already of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which the Government hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:53230:96"/>
our <hi>Eſtates;</hi> and for our <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Grotius</hi> hath furniſh'd us with a Caſe, very ſtrong to ſhew the great Extent of <hi>Sovereign Authority.</hi> He puts a Queſtion, <hi>Whether an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Citizen may be abandoned,</hi> ad Exitium, <hi>even to Deſtruction, for the Common Good. Without doubt,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſuch an innocent Citizen may be ſo abandon'd.</hi> Dubium non eſt quin deſeri poteſt. And going ſtill on, how far ſuch a Citizen is oblig'd to deliver himſelf, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, <hi>That he may be forc'd to it, and ſacrific'd too, to prevent an immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Miſchief, both againſt his Will, and entirely innocent.</hi> Quare &amp; in noſtra controverſia, verius videtur cogi poſſe civem; <hi>for,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Though one Citizen cannot compell another to any thing more than what is ſtrictly juſt according to Law, yet the Superiour hath a lawful Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as Superiour, to force an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Man to ſuffer for the Common Good.</hi> Par parem cogere non poteſt, niſi ad id quod jure debetur ſtrictè

                  <p>We find, even in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of <hi>Holland,</hi> ſo much envied and applauded by Men, who are given to change, that in the <hi>late</hi> Wars with <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> they <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed Mens Purſes</hi> with ſuch <hi>heavy Contributions,</hi> that they were almoſt as much diſſatisfied with their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours at home, as afraid of their Enemies abroad: and all this was done much againſt <hi>the Wills</hi> of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt <hi>every particular Subject.</hi> Nay more, I have heard ſay, That their <hi>Fond,</hi> or <hi>Principal,</hi> (the greateſt part of their Eſtates, for want of Land, conſiſting in Money) is ſo involv'd in the <hi>great Bank,</hi> that they can never retrieve their <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal</hi> again.

                  <p>They made the ſame uſe of it, as all Conquerors generally have done, that is to ſay, leaving the lands to their proper owners, they only <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted a Tribute,</hi> which was gathered amongſt themſelves. Yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, contrary to our Author's Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, <hi>they always retain'd the Empire,</hi> or Government over them, and that for no leſs time than 1500 years. <hi>Aſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am perdomitam vectigalem fecere, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dico tributo magis in titulum imperii,

quam victoriae praemium impoſito. His igitur Aſia, per mille quingentos annos vectigalis fuit. Pendendi tributi finem, Ninus Rex Aſſyriorum impoſuit. Ninus</hi> then was the firſt, who freed the <hi>Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> from their Tribute, and the <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian</hi> Empire. Nor do we read, that he enſlaved them more under his own. But leaving them their <hi>poſſeſſions entire,</hi> yet preſerving always the <hi>Supreme right</hi> of Government, required only ſuch <hi>Contributions,</hi> as himſelf thought neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>After the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Empire, that of the <hi>Medes</hi> began. But no alteration can I find in the <hi>Property of the lands.</hi> On the contrary we read, that the <hi>Perſians</hi> became only <hi>Tributary</hi> to the <hi>Medes. Sed civitates, quae Medorum tributariae fuerant, mutato imperio, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionem ſuam mutatam arbitrantes, à Cyro defecerunt.</hi> That <hi>Thoſe Perſian Cities, which were tributary to the Medes, under Aſtyages, revolted from Cyrus.</hi> But to leave no diſpute in the caſe, <hi>Xenophon</hi> in his <hi>Cyri Inſt. l.</hi> 4. tells us in plain words, that <hi>Cyrus bid the Aſſyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans be of good heart, that their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:53230:99"/>
ſhould be no ways altered, but in the change of their King.</hi> That <hi>they ſhould enjoy their</hi> houſes <hi>and their</hi> lands as <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly they did,</hi> and <hi>have the ſame right over their wives and children. Cyrus victos Aſſyrios jubebat bono eſſe animo, eandem ipſorum ſortem fore, quae fuerat, mutato tantum Rege. Manſuras ipſis</hi> domos, agros, <hi>jus in uxores in liberos, ut fuiſſet hactenus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This, I think, ſhews moſt clearly, that the people enjoy'd the <hi>Property in their lands,</hi> not only under the <hi>Medes</hi> but the <hi>Perſians</hi> alſo. And yet they were ſo far from ſharing any part of the Government, that all men agree, no Princes to have been more abſolute than the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if this be true, as ſure it is, for <hi>Xenophon</hi> was a very good Judge, who wrote particularly the Hiſtory of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> what an <hi>ignorant,</hi> or what an <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent</hi> Author <hi>is Plato Redivivus,</hi> who boldly affirms, <hi>p. 52. that</hi> Cyrus <hi>by name, and other conquering Monarchs before him, took all for themſelves.</hi>

                  <p>From <hi>Aſia,</hi> let us travel into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and by the way we will take notice
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:53230:100"/>
of the Government of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha,</hi> and thoſe five Kingdoms which we read in Scripture, to have been ſubject to <hi>Senacherib</hi> King of <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyria</hi> for twelve years. But we do not find, that either before or after their defection, the King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> had any right to their lands, but only a tribute, which they at length refus'd to pay.</p>
                  <p>With the Hiſtory of the Bible <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> agrees, who tells us, <hi>chap. 10.

in the Red Sea (for <hi>Pharaoh</hi> like <hi>Auguſtus</hi> is only a title of honour) Authors have reckoned a Succeſſion of <hi>Ten Kings,</hi> a time long enough to have eſtabliſh'd a firm Government. And yet we ſee in the days of <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, his Subjects had an undoubted <hi>property</hi> in their lands, which at laſt they ſold, with their freedom alſo, to purchaſe bread. <hi>Quibus agri fuere,</hi> ſaith <hi>Joſephus, partem aliquam in prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium alimentorum, Regi decidebant</hi>—And again, <hi>Non ſolum corpora ſed animos gentis in ſervitutem redegit neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas.</hi> Which <hi>ſervitude</hi> we muſt interpret <hi>ſlavery,</hi> and was now diſtinguiſh'd from ſubjection: for there is no queſtion, but that Subjects in thoſe days, were free both in their perſons and eſtates, which they enjoy'd in <hi>property,</hi> and only liable to ſuch <hi>Impoſitions and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,</hi> as concern'd the publick happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſecurity of the Government.</p>
                  <p>We can by no means agree with our Author, that the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Kings held a kind of <hi>precarious</hi> Kingdom, ſuch as the <hi>Heraclides</hi> in <hi>Sparta.</hi> But being abſolute, according to <hi>Grotius,</hi>

Yet even in this caſe we find, that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> return'd the Lands to moſt of them, upon pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Sixth part only of the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frute which he retein'd, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells us, <hi>Jure Dominii,</hi> which conditions they moſt gladly accepted, <hi>Laeti inſperata reſtitutione agrorum.</hi> And to conclude, let me inform you (from good Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities) that the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Kings were ſo far from retaining or reſerving <hi>all</hi> the <hi>lands</hi> to themſelves, that after the general diviſion of their Territories, their <hi>Lands</hi> were diſtributed into <hi>Three Equal</hi> parts; One part was appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to the <hi>Kings uſe,</hi> and was <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſne</hi> or <hi>Crown-lands;</hi> the <hi>Second</hi> part was aſſign'd to their <hi>Prieſts,</hi> for their <hi>Subſiſtence,</hi> and the ſupport of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary charges of their <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> and other Offices belonging to the <hi>Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Service</hi> of their <hi>Gods.</hi> And the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:53230:101"/>
                     <hi>Third</hi> part was allotted to their <hi>Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiri</hi> or <hi>Milites,</hi> which were thoſe who profeſſed arms for the defence of their Country.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, The <hi>Romans</hi> who held the Soveraign Empire of ſo great a part of the world, had it ſo little in their thoughts to make themſelves <hi>Proprietors</hi> of <hi>all the land</hi> belonging to their Empire, that as well in their <hi>firſt</hi> as <hi>latter</hi> Monarchy, they ſeldom took away more from the Conquered, than was almoſt neceſſary for preſerving their Dominion over them, by the maintaining of <hi>Garriſons,</hi> or planting ſuch <hi>Colonies,</hi> and <hi>Praeda militaria</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, as might, at their own expence, and charges, preſerve their fidelity to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and ſecure the publick peace: Hence <hi>Petilius Cerealis</hi> reproaching the <hi>French</hi> (after his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory over them) for their folly, and defection from the <hi>Roman</hi> protection, he tells them, <hi>That although the Romans had been often provoked,</hi> yet <hi>they added nothing more to what they might claim from their right of Conqueſt, than ſuch conditions as might ſecure their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick

peace. For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>there can be no peace without arms, nor can armies be maintain'd without pay, nor can pay be procured but by Tribute and Taxes. Nos quanquam toties laceſſiti, Jure victoriae id ſolum vobis addidimus, quo pacem tueremur, nam neque quies gentium ſine armis—Tac. Hiſt. 4. Salluſte</hi> tells us, <hi>That the ancient Pious Romans took nothing from the Conquered but the liberty of doing injury or wrong: Majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res noſtri religioſiſſimi mortales nihil victis eripiebant, praeter injuriae licnti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am.

                  <p>Certain it is, that <hi>Romulus</hi> and ſome others of thoſe <hi>firſt</hi> Roman <hi>Monarchs,</hi> us'd their victories with ſo much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, that the Conquered were ſcarce ſenſible, or ſorry they were overcome; whence <hi>Claudius</hi> (blaming, in his Speech to the Senate, the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the <hi>Athenians</hi> and <hi>Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans) At conditor noſter</hi> Romulus, (ſaith he) <hi>tantum ſapientia</hi>

                  <p>Theſe then were the Cuſtoms of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and <hi>Greeks</hi> too, concerning <hi>Lands</hi> between themſelves and the Conquered; let us now ſee how they diſpos'd of their <hi>Lands</hi> between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their Natural Subjects, and we find that <hi>Romulus</hi> made the firſt general diſtribution of his Free men into <hi>Tribes,</hi> and that <hi>Thoſe</hi> again he diſtinguiſhed into <hi>Patres</hi> and <hi>Plebes,</hi> who were afterwards called <hi>Patricians</hi> and <hi>Plebeians,</hi> or <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons;</hi> the <hi>Patricians</hi> were compos'd of ſuch as were eminent either in <hi>Birth, Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, Wealth,</hi> or any other remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Virtue,</hi> and to theſe many great Priviledges and <hi>Poſſeſſions</hi> were grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; out of theſe alone were choſen

their <hi>Prieſts,</hi> as well as <hi>Senators,</hi> and other inferiour <hi>Magiſtrates.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Plebeians</hi> minded only Tillage and Husbandry, and other mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal employments, and were called <hi>Commoners,</hi> or <hi>Roman Citizens,</hi> which title became afterwards an honour of no ſmall eſteem, and was much affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by their neighbours, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by particular <hi>Admiſſion</hi> or <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nization;</hi> many ſuch were choſen out of the <hi>Sabins, Volſcians, Samnites</hi> and others: but leſt this diſtinction between <hi>Patricians</hi> and <hi>Plebeians</hi> might beget on the one ſide, <hi>Inſolence,</hi> and on the other, <hi>Envy,</hi> thoſe pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Monarchs thought fit to unite them by a more endearing Relation, whence the <hi>Patricii</hi> were called <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troni,</hi> or <hi>Patrons</hi> of the <hi>People,</hi> and were to protect them, not only in all <hi>Law Suits,</hi> but in what other occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences might happen to them.

who yielding either to the <hi>Authority</hi> or <hi>Entreaties</hi> of their <hi>Patrons,</hi> were brought to acquieſce, though with ſome little prejudice to their own right, and this continued many Ages, until the ambition of the <hi>Tribunes</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted this good correſpondence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Princes</hi> and the <hi>People:</hi> and ſo honourable did the name of <hi>Client</hi> grow, that many <hi>States</hi> and <hi>Governments,</hi> who have voluntarily committed themſelves to the <hi>fidelity</hi> or <hi>protection</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> did not diſdain that Title.</p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee the <hi>Lands,</hi> even with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the narrow compaſs of the <hi>firſt Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Monarchy, divided amongſt the <hi>Princes</hi> and the <hi>People,</hi> which <hi>Lands</hi> ſo given to the latter, were called <hi>Clientela</hi>'s; and accordingly we may obſerve under <hi>Servius Tullius</hi> their ſixth King, a <hi>Regiſter</hi> of <hi>their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Eſtates: Regis ſolertia, ita eſt ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nata reſpublica, ut omnia</hi> Patrimonii, <hi>dignitatis, aetatis, artium, officiorumque diſcrimina, in tabulas referrentur.

                  <p>Sir, I ſhall grant you all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept this, That the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were <hi>abſolute,</hi> which I can hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, eſpecially ſince our Author tells us the contrary, and inſtances in the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> the <hi>Aſſembly of the Tribes,</hi> and <hi>Congregation of the Lord, who all had a ſhare in the Government, as they had in the property.</hi>

                  <p>I confeſs ſeveral zealous Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths men have aſſerted this <hi>falſe doctrine,</hi> and amongſt others, their old <hi>Coryphaeus, Junius Brutus.</hi> But I find no colour of pretence for this their aſſertion, but we will examine the caſe, as fully as this occaſion will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, and refer you afterwards to what I have writ more at large concerning this point elſewhere.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, it is neceſſary that we ſhould agree, what we mean by an <hi>abſolute Monarch,</hi> which is indeed a point rather controverted, than clearly decided by any Author, that I have yet met withal.</p>

                  </p>

                     <hi>Grotius,</hi> whoſe opinion I muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways eſteem very much, tells us, <hi>that the moſt abſolute or higheſt power, is of that Prince, whoſe actions are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable or ſubject, to any other mans right or authority, ſo as that they may be made void, according to the will or pleaſure, or decrees of any other mortal man, Poteſtas ſumma illa dicitur, cujus actus alterius juri non ſubſtunt, ita ut alterius humanae voluntatis arbitrio, irriti reddi poſſunt. De jure B. &amp; P. p.</hi> 47.</p>
                  <p>But with ſubmiſſion to ſo <hi>great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities,</hi> Theſe do not reach the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of an <hi>abſolute</hi> Monarch, in a <hi>good</hi> ſenſe as it ever ought to be taken. For though they have given their Prince exemption from all Laws, and
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:53230:107"/>
power enough to command, yet they have not excluded <hi>Tyranny,</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is oftentimes miſtaken for <hi>abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute</hi> power.</p>
                  <p>I confeſs it ſeems hard to deſtroy the <hi>Tyrant,</hi> and yet preſerve the <hi>abſolute</hi> Monarch. However I ſhall preſume to give ſuch a definition, as may do both, which I refer to the impartial judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe who ſhall conſider it.</p>
                  <p>An <hi>abſolute Monarch then is he,</hi> who <hi>having receiv'd a juſt authority, executes the Laws of God and Nature without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul.</hi> By receiving a <hi>juſt</hi> authority, I exclude one principal mark of a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, which is <hi>intruſion,</hi> or <hi>uſurpation.</hi> In the next place, I oblige the abſolute Monarch to execute the Laws of God and Nature, <hi>and nothing contrary to them.</hi> By this alſo Government is freed from Tyranny, in the <hi>uſe</hi> or <hi>exerciſe</hi> of authority.</p>
                  <p>For he who governs according to the Laws of God and Nature (I ſpeak of a Natural Monarch, or a Monarch in the ſtate of Nature) does no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt thing, and is by conſequence no Tyrant.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="198" facs="tcp:53230:108"/>And laſtly, as I have ſecur'd the abſolute Prince from Tyranny, <hi>ſo I have plac'd him above all conditional li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Governments,</hi> by theſe words, [<hi>without controul.</hi>] For he who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands or governs as far as the <hi>Laws of God and Nature</hi> permit, hath cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly as <hi>ample,</hi> and as <hi>abſolute</hi> a Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, as any mortal man can <hi>juſtly</hi> poſſeſs. This is ſo large a power, that he who acts beyond it, that is, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to it, is deſervedly eſteem'd a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and <hi>in ſuch caſe the people are not oblig'd to obey.</hi> And the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Prince, having never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd an authority to command that which is <hi>unjuſt,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>contrary to the Laws of God and Nature,</hi> the people are acquitted from their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences as to that <hi>particular command.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All that we have now to do, is but to apply this definition to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Kings, and from thence we ſhall be able to judge of their <hi>abſolute</hi> power.</p>
                  <p>And firſt it is certain, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd their right of power from <hi>God himſelf,</hi> and <hi>no other,</hi> which continued by Succeſſion, eſpecially after <hi>David,</hi> unto the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> captivity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="199" facs="tcp:53230:108"/>I have not time at preſent to inlarge upon this point, and anſwer thoſe fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous objections which ſome men have brought againſt it. You will find this done more fully in another place, and confirm'd by the authority of <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus, Grotius,</hi> and the Hiſtory of the Bible.</p>
                  <p>I know ſome have pretended that <hi>David</hi> received his authority from the <hi>people,</hi> and would prove it by a paſſage in 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 11. where it is ſaid, <hi>that the Elders anointed David King over Iſrael.</hi> But we muſt obſerve, that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was Anointed firſt by <hi>Samuel,</hi> and that by the <hi>expreſs command of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> and next, this <hi>ſecond</hi> Anointing by the people ſignified nothing more, than to exclude by this publick act, the <hi>pretenſions</hi> of <hi>Isboſheth</hi> eldeſt Son to <hi>Saul, Who without the ſpecial reveal'd will of God, would have ſucceeded his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> And this was ever practiſed, where there was any interruption or diſpute in the Succeſſion. So <hi>Solomon was anointed, becauſe of the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and</hi> Adonijah, <hi>otherwiſe that Ceremony was not abſolutely neceſſary,</hi>
                     <pb n="200" facs="tcp:53230:109"/>
and was many times totally neglected. Beſides, in the caſe of <hi>David,</hi> it is plain, that he received no <hi>right</hi> of power from the <hi>people,</hi> but from God, and that by their own confeſſion both <hi>before</hi> and <hi>after</hi> their anointing. <hi>And the</hi> Lord <hi>thy</hi> God <hi>ſaid unto thee, thou ſhalt feed my people Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>thou ſhalt be ruler over my people Iſrael.</hi> And again, <hi>They anointed David King over Iſrael, according to the word of the Lord by Samuel, 1 Chron.</hi> 11. 2, 3. Hence <hi>Grotius</hi> obſerves, that <hi>David</hi> gave God thanks, for that <hi>God</hi> had ſubjected his people unto him. <hi>David Deo gratias agit, quod populum ſuum ſibi ſubjece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Taking it therefore for granted, that <hi>David</hi> received no right of power from the <hi>people,</hi> by conſequence he depended upon none but God, as all the moſt Soveraign Princes do, <hi>and this is one great mark</hi> of an <hi>abſolute Monarch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the next place, he executed the laws of God and nature <hi>without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul.</hi> I never heard any queſtion made of this, except in the caſe of
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:53230:109"/>
                     <hi>judgment concerning a Tribe,</hi> the <hi>High Prieſt,</hi> and a <hi>Prophet.</hi> Which judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <hi>Grotius</hi> ſuppoſed, were taken from the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Kings, <hi>Aliqua judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia arbitror regibus adempta.</hi> But I rather think, under favour, that they were more properly, <hi>Principibus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſa,</hi> which makes a conſiderable difference. For I find no mention of any <hi>time</hi> or <hi>power,</hi> who could take thoſe judgments from the King.</p>
                  <p>On the contrary we read of ſeveral Kings, erecting Courts of Judicature, and making Judges both in <hi>Gods cauſe</hi> and in <hi>the Kings.</hi> And theſe three points being of the higheſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, the judgment of them might moſt probably be granted by the King, to the determination of the higheſt Court of Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt of <hi>Chron. chap. 26. v.</hi> 5. We find <hi>David making Rulers over the Reubenites, the Gadites,</hi> and <hi>the half Tribe of Manaſſeh, for every matter per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to God</hi> and the <hi>affairs of the King;</hi> but more particularly in the ſecond of <hi>Chron. chap. 19. Jehoſhaphat</hi> does the ſame thing, but in terms
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:53230:110"/>
more plain, <hi>And he ſet Judges in the Land through all the fenced Cities of Judah, City by City. And ſaid to the Judges, take heed what you do,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over in Jeruſalem did Jehoſhaphat ſet of the Levites, and of the Prieſts, and of the</hi> Chief <hi>of the</hi> Fathers <hi>of Iſrael, for the judgments of the Lord, and for controverſies when they return'd to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem. And behold Amariel the Chief Prieſt is over you, in all matters of the Lord, and Zedekiah the ſon of Iſhmael, the Ruler of the houſe of Judah, for all the Kings matters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed I ſhould think that this is plain enough to prove, that their Kings had in them the <hi>Supreme right,</hi> of adminiſtring juſtice through their territories, and made their <hi>Subordinate</hi> officers, who <hi>wholly</hi> depended upon them; and I am the more confirm'd in this opinion, becauſe I find both the <hi>High Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Prophets</hi> too <hi>judged, condemned</hi> and <hi>pardoned,</hi> even <hi>againſt</hi> the judgment of the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> by the Kings <hi>ſingle authority.</hi>

                  <p>I confeſs I have read this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in <hi>Junius Brutus,</hi> and know not which moſt to wonder at, his <hi>impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> or his <hi>impious knavery.</hi> The words in the Vulgar Tranſlation, which <hi>Scaliger</hi> eſteems the beſt, run thus, <hi>Ecce in poteſtate veſtra eſt, nam contra vos Rex nihil poteſt.

                  </p>
                  <p>But our brute Author, by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallell'd wickedneſs, perverts both the ſence and words of the <hi>Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and tranſlates it, <hi>Ipſis contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere</hi> nulla <hi>in re poſſe.</hi> And ſo would make the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> ſo abſolute, that the King could not contradict them in <hi>any</hi> thing, but we ſhall diſcover his impoſture by the Hiſtory it ſelf, and practice of <hi>Zedekiah</hi> even in this very caſe.</p>
                  <p>And it is firſt certain, that the King meant nothing more by this anſwer, than that he left <hi>Jeremiah</hi> to be <hi>Tried by his Judges according to Law.</hi> And indeed as his affairs ſtood, he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to diſpleaſe the Princes, in a caſe which they thought ſo nearly concerned the good of the people and
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:53230:111"/>
ſafety of the King, which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd was indanger'd by the diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging Prophecies of <hi>Jeremiah.

Nay and could judge the King himſelf, <hi>Illi Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem judicare poſſunt,</hi> which I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent was never found in the whole Hiſtory of the Bible.</p>
                  <p>But to return to this caſe. We find firſt, that <hi>Zedekiah</hi> had by his <hi>own au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority impriſon'd Jeremiah,</hi> ch. 30. v. 3. And <hi>Jeremiah the Prophet was ſhut up in the Court of the priſon, which was in the King of Judah's houſe. For</hi> Zede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah King <hi>of Judah, had ſhut him up.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Next we may obſerve, that the Princes applied themſelves to the King, that they might have leave to put the Prophet to death, and that in terms reſpectful enough, <hi>Jer.</hi> 38. 4.
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:53230:112"/>
                     <hi>Therefore ſaid the Princes unto the King; We</hi> beſeech <hi>thee, let this man be put to death.</hi> Now what needed this <hi>imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent,</hi> and indeed <hi>abuſive</hi> complement to the King, if the <hi>whole</hi> authority was in the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> or Princes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. But to take away all manner of diſpute, we find not only applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made to the King, to releaſe <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah</hi> and his <hi>own order</hi> thereupon, <hi>Ebedmelech went forth out of the Kings houſe, and ſpake unto the King, ſaying, My Lord the King, theſe men have done evil in all that they have done to</hi> Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah <hi>the Prophet, whom thou haſt caſt into the dungeon,</hi> &amp;c. Then the King commanded <hi>Ebedmelech</hi> the <hi>Egyptian,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Take from hence thirty men with thee, and take up Jeremiah the Prophet out of the dungeon before he dies, cap.</hi> 38. I ſay, beſides this, we read alſo in the ſame <hi>chap.</hi> That <hi>Jeremiah</hi> made his addreſs to the King, that he might not dye, which moſt aſſuredly, being a Prophet of the Lord, he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have done, had it not been in the <hi>Kings power</hi> to have granted his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, or had it been an <hi>infringement</hi> of
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:53230:112"/>
the lawful power of the <hi>Sanhedrim.</hi> And thereupon <hi>Zedekiah, without ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leave of the Elders,</hi> promis'd him that he ſhould not dye, and in terms which ſufficiently expreſs his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign authority. Then <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſaid unto <hi>Zedekiah, If I declare it to thee, wilt thou not ſurely put me to death.</hi> So <hi>Zedekiah the King ſwore ſecretly to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah, ſaying, As the Lord liveth that made us this ſoul, I will not put thee to death, neither will I give thee into the hands of theſe men, that ſeek thy life, v.</hi> 15, 16. I think theſe words need no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation, I ſhall only add this remark to ſhew the <hi>fourberie</hi> of our Author, which is, That in caſe this ſtory could have paſs'd according to his own ſenſe of it, yet it would not have prov'd what he deſign'd it ſhould have done. For <hi>Zedekiah</hi> at that time was not <hi>abſolute</hi> as the <hi>former</hi> Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> had been, but was <hi>tributary</hi> to the King of <hi>Babylon.</hi> And <hi>when the year was ended,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>King Nebuchadnezzar made Zedekiah King over Judah and Jeruſalem, 2 Chron.</hi> 36. 10.

                  <p>The later <hi>Goths,</hi> which were of the race of the <hi>Viſigoths,</hi> being much weakned and <hi>harraſſed</hi> by the <hi>Romans,</hi> at laſt, under their King <hi>Alaric,</hi> obtained permiſſion from the <hi>Emperor Honorius,</hi> to retire into <hi>Spain.</hi> But being treacherouſly purſued by <hi>Stilico,</hi> whom they overcame, were ſo incenſed againſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> that they immediately returned, and <hi>ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Rome</hi> again, ſet down in that part of <hi>France,</hi> which they call <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincia,</hi> or <hi>Gallia Narbonenſis.</hi> There being again beaten, they entred into <hi>Spain,</hi> and poſſeſſed it, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened about the year of our Lord 412.

This happened about the year Five hundred and thirty.</p>
                  <p>Now, Couſin, you muſt obſerve<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that though both theſe <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals</hi> inſtituted a kind of Kingly Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, yet their Prince was rather a General than a Monarch, and their affairs were for the moſt part ſo <hi>turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,</hi> that they were in a continual ſtate of <hi>war.</hi> Sometimes their ſucceſs was good, but generally bad. And, as the honour of Victory is given to the chief Commander, ſo the ill for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune falls heavieſt upon his head, who governs. Hence thoſe inſolent people might poſſibly, as our Author ſays, <hi>beat the Kings brains out,</hi> or commit many outrages upon his perſon, who
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:53230:120"/>
was indeed in ſome things <hi>accountable</hi> to his people, and held a Kingdom ſo <hi>precarious,</hi> that <hi>Grotius</hi> thinks them not worthy of the <hi>name</hi> or <hi>title</hi> of Kings.</p>
                  <p>But no man ſure that had not his hands in ſome meaſure, already dy'd with the blood of one of the beſt Kings, could have commended a people for <hi>beating out the brains of their Soveraign,</hi> nor imagined, that ſome excellent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as he ſays, contriv'd a Government, in which the people have ever been call'd and accounted <hi>moſt barbarous,</hi> by all the moſt civiliz'd Monarchies, and learned men in <hi>Europe,</hi> and even by <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copius</hi> himſelf.</p>
                  <p>He tells us, that <hi>nothing remains, that may give us any great light, in what their excellencies conſiſted.</hi> Truly our Author ſeems to have grop'd in the dark for all the arguments and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities which he hath produc'd to favour his innovation.

                  <p>Sir, you may eaſily believe, that if the people were Maſters of the Government, they would not fail to give themſelves large proportions of the lands. But this made their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ſo irregular, and ſubject to ſo many inconveniencies, that inſtead of being ſetled according to the exact rules of the Polities, as our Author thinks, it was moſt <hi>inſupportable,</hi> and not capable of any long ſubſiſtence. And in effect, we ſee both their name and government ſo totally extinct, that thoſe people who poſſeſſed almoſt all <hi>Europe,</hi> are not now to be found in any part of it.</p>
                  <p>Such was the caſe of the once flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Kingdom of the <hi>Jews;</hi> which (when the Seditious people, as <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nahemus, Eliazarus,</hi> and others, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to ſet up a popular Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,) was utterly deſtroy'd, and of two ſuch mighty Nations, nothing is left, but ſome few <hi>wandring remains</hi> or <hi>old ruſtick monuments,</hi> which ſerve only to teſtifie that they <hi>once have been.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="225" facs="tcp:53230:121"/>I confeſs, had the authority of the <hi>Gothick</hi> Kings been Abſolute and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent, I know no great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, that their <hi>diſtribution</hi> of the <hi>lands,</hi> could have produced. Yet that too ought to be done, with diſcretion and good conſideration, or many miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, and ruine in the end may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue.</p>
                  <p>To this purpoſe, our Author, I thank him, hath put us in mind of a memorable example. For <hi>Plutarch</hi> tells us, that <hi>Cleomenes</hi> King of <hi>Sparta,</hi> endeavouring to make himſelf Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, ſlew the <hi>Ephori.</hi> And the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ingratiate himſelf with the people, <hi>divided the lands</hi> amongſt them. But being deſperately attack'd by <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigonus</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> before he had well eſtabliſhed his Soveraign Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he could not <hi>raiſe money,</hi> to <hi>pay</hi> either his <hi>Mercenary ſoldiers,</hi> or his <hi>own</hi> Citizens. Whence for want of that power, he was totally <hi>routed, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemon ſack'd,</hi> and the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome became a Province to the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonians.</hi>

                  <p>Without doubt many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencies may happen, in which an <hi>Abſolute Power</hi> in the Prince, may prove the greateſt ſecurity to a Kingdom againſt a Foreign Invaſion. For whilſt the people are conſulted withal, or intreated to contribute toward the neceſſary expences of war, by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely frugality, and indiſcreet hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry the whole may be loſt.</p>
                  <p>I remember a ſtory very appoſite to this purpoſe, in the wars between the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> under <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Fifteenth, and laſt Chriſtian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of <hi>Greece.</hi> The numerous Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the <hi>Turks,</hi> had ſo waſted the beſieged in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> had no hopes of preſerving the City, but by a <hi>ſupply</hi> of <hi>Mercenary Soldiers.</hi> To procure theſe, a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>ſum of mony</hi> was requiſite. But the <hi>brutal and covetous Greeks</hi> would not be prevail'd upon to part with any thing at <hi>preſent,</hi> though they had no other hopes, to preſerve all for the <hi>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> So the unfortunate Emperour was ſlain, and the City taken, and ſack'd from top to bottom, with all
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:53230:122"/>
the inſolences that might be expected from a <hi>Pagan</hi> Conquerour. Among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> the Admiral <hi>Notaras</hi> was accounted the <hi>moſt rich,</hi> and had been the moſt ſolicited by the Emperour to prevent, by a <hi>chearful contribution,</hi> and his good example, the <hi>fatal hour</hi> of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Empire. But <hi>curſed ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice</hi> doth often blind our reaſon ſo much, that we are forc'd to yield That to our <hi>enemies,</hi> which might have once preſerv'd our <hi>friends.</hi> And ſo it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened. For <hi>Notaras</hi> burying all his Treaſure, whileſt the Siege endured, at laſt to preſerve his life, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement the New Emperour <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> the ſecond, he <hi>raiſed his dead mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi> from the grave, and preſenting <hi>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But, Sir, Begging your pardon for this Digreſſion, let us return to the <hi>Goths,</hi> of whom I think you were ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That they have left little behind them, which retains the memory that they once have been. Pray, what ſay you to thoſe <hi>Tenures,</hi> which are yet extant in many parts of <hi>Europe.</hi> Were they not of the <hi>Gothick</hi> inſtitution, and do they not ſufficiently teſtifie, not only that they <hi>were,</hi> but that they were alſo a <hi>wiſe people,</hi> ſince their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment has remain'd ſo long after them.</p>

                  <p>Sir, I perceive you uſe the word Government promiſcuouſly, as indeed our Author himſelf does. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he makes it ſignifie the <hi>Supreme</hi> right of power, ſometimes the <hi>Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>neither,</hi> but only the <hi>effects</hi> of Government as in this caſe.</p>
                  <p>Now though theſe Tenures have remained in ſome Kingdoms, yet they
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:53230:123"/>
prove little of the wiſdom, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the excellent Government of thoſe <hi>Goths.</hi> For the laſt, it is either totally loſt, or elſe ſo changed, that it is not any more to be known. For I do not hear or read of any ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious Kingdom as theirs was, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant at this day in <hi>Europe.</hi> Nor is it probable there ſhould, for as hath been already obſerved, ſuch a conſtitution is ſo irregular, and contrary to the nature of Government, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not continue long in that neutrality. For either the people will take all the power into their hands, whence ſome little Commonwealths have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſprung up, or elſe the King will by degrees become abſolute and independent, ſuch as moſt of the Monarchs are at preſent throughout the whole world. And for their Tenures, you will eaſily find how they were continued, if you conſider that many little Kingdoms have been built upon the ruines of the declining <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> which had been overrun by the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandalls, Roman paula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim coepit minui jam gentes quae Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum

                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe new Princes thought no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more conducible to the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their new Governments, than to make as little <hi>innovation</hi> as they could, but rather leave the conquered, who were afterwards to become their Subjects, in the ſame condition as they found them. And thoſe <hi>Tenures</hi> having no great matter of ill in them, provided their Lords had no <hi>right</hi> in the <hi>Soveraign Authority</hi> as they had not; many of them have continued, with little alteration to this day.</p>
                  <p>This, Couſin, is I think ſufficient to prove, that contrary to our Author's propoſition, moſt Kings which have been in the world, though they had an abſolute and an independent right of power, yet they have permitted the Lands to be divided, and in the poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the people. And that though in the mixt Monarchy of the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandalls,</hi> ſome part of the power as well as poſſeſſions, were
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:53230:124"/>
in the Commonalty, yet that is no reaſon to us, why, neglecting all the other more civilized and flouriſhing Empires of <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> as well as <hi>Europe,</hi> we muſt alone bring thoſe <hi>Northern inſtances,</hi> in contradiction to all the <hi>Southern,</hi> and the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> learning, as the <hi>only</hi> true politick ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, for our preſent imitation. And to conclude, The inſtance which you have brought of a maſter, <hi>who entruſts the ſword into the hands of his ſervants, with conditions, nevertheleſs, oaths and obligations to uſe it only in defence of their maſter, and according to his command, and no otherwiſe, yet you ſay, theſe ſervants, having the power in their hands, may when they pleaſe govern the Maſter himſelf, and turn him out of doors too, if they think it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient ſo to do.</hi> This indeed cannot be denied, but it proves nothing ſtill of our Authors propoſition. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they have the ſword in their hands, yet it being delivered upon the forementioned <hi>conditions,</hi> and under ſuch <hi>obligations,</hi> they receive thereby no <hi>right</hi> of power, but are rather un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

                     <hi>ſtricter vows</hi> of obedience.

                  <p>O ſilly, truly for our Authors reputations ſake, I thought to have paſſed by ſo childiſh a conjecture. I will not go about to prove, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally all Arts and Sciences had their riſe in that Countrey, becauſe our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor hath confeſſed it. Nor tell you that <hi>Aegypt,</hi> was an abſolute Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy many hundred years before, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have already given you good authorities for it. Neither will I trouble you with a long Catalogue of moſt excellent men, for all manner
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:53230:129"/>
of learning, who lived as well under the elder Monarchies, as later ones of <hi>Rome, Germany, Spain, France, England</hi> and many others. Let our <hi>Authors</hi> own <hi>profound Learning,</hi> riſe up in judgment in this caſe againſt himſelf, ſince it is plain, that his <hi>vaſt politick knowledge, ſprang up, bloom'd, brought forth fruit, withered</hi> and <hi>decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> and all under a <hi>Monarchical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi> For whether we conſider him in the days of King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Iſt.</hi> or under <hi>Oliver,</hi> or at <hi>Rome,</hi> or ſince his preſent Majeſties happy Reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he hath ſtill ſucked in a <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical Air.</hi> I do not hear that all was effected at <hi>Geneva,</hi> though moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably the firſt <hi>ſowre Grapes</hi> came from thence, which have ſet <hi>his teeth on edge</hi> ever ſince.</p>

                  <p>Indeed I think ſo <hi>ſober</hi> a <hi>politician</hi> might have ſpared ſuch a little malicious remark. But to go on, he tells us, <hi>p. 45. That Rome was the beſt and moſt glorious Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the Sun ever ſaw.</hi>

                  <p>Our Stateſman hath coupled <hi>beſt</hi> and <hi>glorious</hi> together, as Poulterers
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:53230:129"/>
uſe to do a <hi>lean</hi> and a <hi>fat Rabbit,</hi> that one may help off with the other. But his vulgar cheat muſt not paſs. For <hi>glorious,</hi> we will admit of that Epithete, and good Authors give us the reaſon how it came to be ſo, which is not much to our purpoſe. But for <hi>beſt,</hi> we muſt examine that a little far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>I could cite many Authorities to prove that the <hi>Roman</hi> Commonwealth was one of the <hi>worſt Governments,</hi> that ever ſubſiſted ſo long. But becauſe I would ſpeak ſomewhat to our noble <hi>Venetian,</hi> who ought to have read his own Authors, concerning Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at home, before he came to judge of another abroad, I will refer him for full ſatisfaction in this point, to the <hi>Diſcorſi politici</hi> of <hi>Paulus Paruta, a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman and Senator of Venice, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curator of Saint</hi> Marco. Who in his <hi>firſt</hi> diſcourſe, comparing ſeveral An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Commonwealths, with that of <hi>Venice,</hi> when he comes to <hi>Rome,</hi> he tells us plainly, That the Sun <hi>never ſaw a more confuſed State.</hi> That <hi>it was really no regular government at all,</hi> and
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:53230:130"/>
                     <hi>that its</hi> chief <hi>default</hi> proceeded from the <hi>exorbitant power of the people.</hi> Whence <hi>Tacitus</hi> calls it, <hi>lib. 3. Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſſima Reſpublica.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, Sir, if this noble Senator, who alſo had been Ambaſſador abroad, underſtood any thing of Government, as I believe he did, even more than the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gent. Young <hi>Venetian</hi> and learned Doctor, put all together, then we muſt conclude, that our Author is miſtaken. But ſince it is not the firſt time, we will put it to account.</p>

                  <speaker>Mer.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, Sir, he ſaith next, <hi>p. 52. That Moſes, Theſeus, and Romulus were founders of Democracies.</hi> What ſay you to that?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Trav.</speaker>
                  <p>If I miſtake not, he tells us the ſame thing in <hi>p.</hi> 28. 32, &amp; 69. In ſome of which he calls their Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy, in plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. For <hi>Moſes,</hi> I have already prov'd his authority to have been <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent,</hi> even in the higheſt meaſure, upon any but God, and that in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe none ever us'd it more arbitrarily, witneſs the ſevere puniſhments againſt the Idolaters, when he came down
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:53230:130"/>
from Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> Where without any farther Ceremonies, or <hi>legal trial,</hi> he call'd the Sons of <hi>Levi</hi> to him, and ſaid: <hi>Put every man his ſword by his ſide, and go in from gate to gate through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Camp, and ſlay every man his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour. And the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Levi did according to the word of Moſes, and there fell of the people that day about 3000. men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many other inſtances there are of his Deſpotical power; beſides, the Text ſaith in plain words, that <hi>Moſes was King in Jeſhurun.</hi>—For the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling together the Congregation of the Lord by ſound of Trumpet, all men, who ever read the Bible know, that it was generally to tell them ſome <hi>meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage</hi> from God, <hi>reproach them</hi> for their miſdeeds, exhort them to <hi>amendment,</hi> and ſuch like. But I am confident they never did any one act, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from a <hi>right of power</hi> while <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> liv'd. Nay, on the contrary, when the Seditious Princes, <hi>Corah, Datban</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> as alſo <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Miriam,</hi> murmured againſt <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:53230:131"/>
authority, being deſirous to have <hi>ſhar'd</hi> with him in the <hi>Government,</hi> we find that God puniſhed their <hi>Sedition</hi> moſt ſeverely, and the <hi>two laſt</hi> eſcaped the Juſtice of Gods ſentence, only through the great interceſſion of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Who knows not that his <hi>Praeſecti Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throniani,</hi> were only ſubordinate Judges appointed by his <hi>own order,</hi> and for his <hi>own eaſe.</hi> All which, beſides the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conſent of learned men, makes it clear that <hi>Moſes</hi> held the Supreme <hi>Civil</hi> power, <hi>wholly</hi> in himſelf, call him King, or Captain, or what you pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>Next <hi>Theſeus</hi> being own'd after his long Travels, by his father <hi>Aegeus,</hi> found <hi>Attica</hi> Tributary to <hi>Minos,</hi> King of <hi>Candia,</hi> and the Kingdom divided in it ſelf, into ſeveral little <hi>Burgs,</hi> which ſet up for ſo many particular ſeveral Governments. <hi>Theſeus</hi> therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a diſcreet Prince, endeavour'd to reduce them to their former obedience by peaceable means. To that purpoſe he perſwades them to unite under one Government, knowing that they would become thereby, (like a bundle of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows) much the ſtronger.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="245" facs="tcp:53230:131"/>And that the name of Tyrant might not affright them, or the loſs of their fond <hi>power</hi> and <hi>freedom</hi> diſcourage them, he promiſed to abate ſo much, of his own <hi>Soveraign right</hi> of Government, as to <hi>conſult</hi> with them, and take their <hi>opinions</hi> in weighty affairs, as he did in a common Hall or meeting place called <hi>Aſty.</hi> In this method things went proſperouſly on until one <hi>Mneſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> a factious and an ambitious Prince of the houſe of <hi>Ericthonius,</hi> inſinuating to the people, that <hi>Theſeus</hi> intended at laſt to <hi>enſlave</hi> them, he cauſed the <hi>Athenians</hi> to rebell. <hi>Theſeus</hi> retired to the <hi>Iſland S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Now if there be any thing in this ſtory, which makes for our Author, much good may it do him.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, <hi>Romulus</hi> cannot ſure be ſaid to have inſtituted the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:53230:132"/>
of <hi>Rome,</hi> any more than <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth the Republick of <hi>Holland,</hi> from whoſe ſucceſſors thoſe people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled. <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſays moſt clearly, <hi>That Rome was governed in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by Kings, and that their liberty was procured by</hi> L.

Romulus ut libitum nobis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peraverat.

Conſtat initio civitatis Reges omnem poteſtatem habuiſſe,</hi> ſays <hi>Pomponius. That in the beginning of the City</hi> (of Rome) <hi>their Kings enjoyed intirely the whole Soveraign Authority.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But not to multiply Authorities, to prove ſuch vulgar truths, I ſhall refer

you to our Authors chief <hi>Divine,</hi> I mean the <hi>Divine Machiavel,</hi> (as he ſtiles him more than once) his words are full and very intelligible, where he calls all three <hi>Princes</hi> and their Governments <hi>Kingdoms. Verum ut ad eos, qui non fortuna, ſed ſingulari virtute in Principes ſunt evecti venia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> (ſpeaking all the while of Kings) <hi>excellentiores dico fuiſſe Moſen, Cyrum, Romulum, Theſeum,</hi> and again, which puts all out of diſpute, <hi>At qui Cyrum &amp; reliquos, qui Regna ſibi</hi> pepererunt, &amp; conſtituerunt, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> And farther of <hi>Romulus, quo Romano imperio potiretur, de Principe, ca.</hi> 6.

                  </p>
                  <p>But if <hi>Plato</hi>'s <hi>Divine</hi> were not an ignorant <hi>Aſs,</hi> then our Author is certainly a very <hi>impudent impoſtor.</hi>

theſe great men had inſtituted popular Governments, (as I am fully convinced they did not) what doth that concern us?

                  <p>In <hi>p.</hi> 62. we read, <hi>That it is not dangerous to a City, to have their people rich; but to have ſuch a power in the Governing part of the Empire, as ſhould make thoſe, who manage the affairs of the Commonwealth depend upon them, which came afterwards to be that, which ruined their libertie, and which the Gracchi endeavoured to prevent, when

                  <p>Sir, We will preſerve his ſence, but giving other names to the Country, People, and Governours, we ſhall ſee more plainly how it runs. Let us ſay then, <hi>that it is not dangerous for England, to have their people rich even in land</hi> (for he ſpeaks immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before of the <hi>Romans</hi> purchaſing lands) <hi>but to have ſuch a ſhare in the right of Government as ſhould make the King, who manages the affairs of the Kingdom depend upon them;</hi> methinks it is very <hi>clear,</hi> and it has ever been my judgment, that the people might have what proportion their induſtry could procure them in the <hi>lands,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they did not pretend to any <hi>ſhare</hi> in the <hi>Soveraign authority.</hi>

<pb n="250" facs="tcp:53230:134"/>
to mend his ſenſe, except I ſhould make him appear, at the ſame time, the moſt <hi>falſe, partial,</hi> and <hi>prejudiced</hi> ſcribler that ever wrote.</p>

                  <p>Let us then ſee what follows, <hi>Which,</hi> ſays he, <hi>came afterwards to be that which ruin'd their liberty,</hi> and which the <hi>Gracchi endeavour'd to prevent.</hi> Pray Couſin, what is the antecedent to <hi>which,</hi> in theſe two places?</p>

                  <speaker>Mer.</speaker>
                  <p>Sure, Sir, that is moſt plain; and according to my underſtanding, it is, that <hi>power in the governing part of the Empire,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>You are right without doubt; and I dare affirm, that <hi>Q. Ennius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, could not make any other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of it. And if ſo, then the whole ſentence runs thus. <hi>It was not dangerous to the Commonwealth of</hi> Rome <hi>to have their Subjects rich; but it was dangerous that the Subject ſhould have ſuch a power in the governing part of the Empire, as ſhould make their Governours
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:53230:134"/>
depend upon them, which power of the people in the governing part of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, came afterwards to be that, which ruin'd the peoples liberty.</hi> And <hi>which power</hi> (for all the world knows, that, <hi>and,</hi> in this place is a conjunction co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulative) <hi>the Gracchi endeavour'd to prevent,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Now, Sir, the firſt part of this Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is moſt really ſound doctrine and truth, though diametrically oppoſite to <hi>Plato</hi>'s grand propoſition, upon which undeniable Aphoriſm, as he ſays, he is <hi>to build</hi> moſt <hi>of his ſubſequent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For indeed the people, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo rich, are by no means to be truſted with a right of power, but as I have ſaid, rather the contrary, leſt they ſhould confound government, or ſet it upon its head, with its feet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt. And ſo that power, which the <hi>Roman</hi> people pretended to, under the Seditious <hi>Gracchi</hi> and others, was the true cauſe which made the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth no longer governable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that form. <hi>Haec ipſa in perniciem redibant &amp; miſera Reſpublica in exiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um

                  <p>But leſt all ſhould come to ruine, and the conquering <hi>Romans</hi> be at laſt overcome by their own victorious arms, the arbitrary government of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours was introduc'd, as the <hi>only remedy</hi> for the truly diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered State. <hi>Non aliud diſcordantis patriae remedium fuiſſe quam ut ab uno regeretur,</hi> Tacit.

                  <p>Now though this be the practice of the moſt renowned Republick of <hi>Venice,</hi> yet I am confident our Author would much blame ſuch an <hi>Arbitrary</hi> way of proceeding under any Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical government, eſpecially if <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> (as he juſtly deſerves) ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be made the <hi>firſt</hi> example, as he is of that kind, one of the <hi>greateſt offenders.</hi>

                  <p>Your next remark is in p. 88. where it is ſaid, <hi>that the people, (under the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Emperours) who had really an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to endeavour a change of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, were ſo prevented by ſeeing the Prince, whom they deſigned to ſupplant, removed to their hand, that they were
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:53230:143"/>
puzled what to do; taking in the mean time great recreation to ſee thoſe wild beaſts hunted down themſelves, who had ſo often prey'd upon their lives and eſtates,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>Very fine ſport indeed for an <hi>old Rebel,</hi> and I am perſwaded, <hi>Plato</hi> would be highly pleas'd (as old as he is) to follow briskly ſome ſuch <hi>Royal chaſe.</hi> But his <hi>blood-hounds</hi> are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent a little out of <hi>tune,</hi> and I hope he will loſe his <hi>impious</hi> diverſion. But to return to his Hiſtorical obſervation, he tells us, that the <hi>people, who had an intereſt to change the Government, want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed time to deſtroy their Prince themſelves, becauſe it was done ſo to their hands.</hi> And yet the miſchief on't is, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>firſt</hi> change of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is generally the <hi>moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable,</hi> the people had <hi>as much time</hi> as they could have wiſh'd.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Tiberius,</hi> his Succeſſor, had obtain'd the age of <hi>Seventy eight</hi> before he left his Empire, with the world; a time
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:53230:143"/>
long enough for ſuch <hi>good Subjects</hi> and <hi>Patriots</hi> of their country as <hi>Plato Redi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vivus,</hi> to have chang'd the Arbitrary Government to its <hi>ancient popular</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Claudius</hi> alſo reign'd long enough, and the people wanted not time nor opportunity. And for thoſe ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Caeſars,</hi> as <hi>Nero, Galba, Otho, Vitel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> they were taken off rather by the <hi>fury</hi> of the <hi>Soldiers,</hi> and private ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and ambition of particular men, than <hi>diſcontent</hi> of the <hi>Citizens.</hi> Nay, the <hi>people,</hi> as they chiefly defended their Emperours whilſt alive, ſo they were the moſt conſiderable <hi>ſufferers</hi> by their <hi>deaths.</hi> And notwithſtanding the great irregularity in the <hi>Politick principles</hi> of thoſe Emperours, by keeping the Soveraign power, and yet leaving the <hi>property</hi> to the <hi>people. That</hi> Empire (though latterly much divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and diſmembred, chiefly by the Emperours themſelves, and partly by the Ambition of the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhops) hath ſubſiſted 1700 years, and may for ought we know, continue as many more, and yet no Government more
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:53230:144"/>
averſe to our great Politicians rule.</p>
                  <p>But, Sir, if we muſt anſwer all the <hi>impertinencies, incongruities,</hi> and <hi>miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applications</hi> of this <hi>Scribbling States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> there will be no end of our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. Pray therefore let us make as ſhort work as we can, and to that purpoſe we will reduce what is moſt conſiderable under ſome <hi>heads.</hi> And the firſt thing which occurs, is the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count which he gives, <hi>p.</hi> 97. and 145. of the Government of <hi>France;</hi> In which he tells us, that <hi>France hath no Freemen below the Nobility, that is Yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. That the Gentry are very needy and numerous, becauſe the elder brother in moſt parts of the Kingdom, hath no more ſhare in the diviſion of the paternal eſtate, than the Cadets, excepting the principal houſe,</hi> &amp;c. which they <hi>call, Vol de Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon.</hi> And from hence he draws ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral falſe arguments. To the firſt, I cannot find, upon the beſt examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I could make, any conſiderable difference between the conſtitution of <hi>France,</hi> and that of <hi>England,</hi> as to the Gentry and Commonalty. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I do not obſerve, any ſuch
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:53230:144"/>
titular diſtinction as Yeomen in <hi>France,</hi> which is alſo antiquated, or almoſt loſt and confounded amongſt us. Yet there is a notorious difference between the <hi>Roturiers,</hi> or thoſe whom he calls <hi>Villains,</hi> and the <hi>Freeholders.</hi> The latter are compos'd generally of little <hi>Merchants, Tradeſmen, Shop-keepers,</hi> and ſuch like, and they are diſtinguiſh'd by their <hi>Tenures</hi> or Services, which they call <hi>Droit de Corvie,</hi> and <hi>Droit de Cenſive.</hi> The firſt is properly <hi>Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenage,</hi> as, working for his Lord, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his <hi>Body, Cart,</hi> or <hi>Horſes,</hi> or ſuch like. The other, that is to ſay, <hi>Droit de Cenſive,</hi> doth not oblige the Free-holder to any manner of <hi>ſervile</hi> office, but only the payment of ſome ſmall rent, as Cocks, Hens, or ſome little part of the profits. They have their <hi>Quint</hi> and <hi>Requint,</hi> which are certain <hi>Fines</hi> upon <hi>Alienations,</hi> as alſo their <hi>Copyholders,</hi> and lands held in <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velkind;</hi> and in a word, I know no greater difference, between the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subjects, as to the point of <hi>Lands</hi> and <hi>Properties,</hi> than this, That the Lands <hi>ennoble,</hi> or at leaſt
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:53230:145"/>
give <hi>Titles</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> as Comte, Baron, Marquiſs, which priviledges were taken away, I think, from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the reign of <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. and which came originally from the <hi>French,</hi> being introduc'd by <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror.</p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>needy</hi> and <hi>numerous Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> to the laſt, all the world knows, that <hi>France</hi> is extreme populous, as well in Commonalty as Gentry. The men being very <hi>Briſk,</hi> and the women, it ſeems, very <hi>Pregnant.</hi> But for their <hi>wants,</hi> I mean of the Gentry, I think it is as publickly known, that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed generally from a different cauſe, from what our Author hath aſſign'd. That is, from the <hi>Scruple</hi> which they make of undertaking any <hi>Mercan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile employment,</hi> which is the greateſt ſupport of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> families, ſo that there is no <hi>Cadet</hi> of a houſe <hi>ennobled,</hi> who had not rather <hi>trail a pike,</hi> than be an <hi>apprentice</hi> to the greateſt <hi>Merchant</hi> in <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All theſe <hi>Cadets,</hi> our Author hath brought to Court, and made them the chief <hi>props</hi> of the preſent <hi>French</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and greatneſs. But he hath
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:53230:145"/>
forgot, That as the young <hi>French</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility are very numerous, ſo the vaſt number of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Preferments, Monaſteries</hi> and <hi>Temporal offices,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending eternally and at all times upon the Crown, do entertain ſo many of theſe <hi>young Cadets,</hi> that I am confident, at leaſt <hi>two thirds</hi> of the younger chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, are provided for after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, without depending immediately upon the King's Purſe. As to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of the Paternal eſtate, amongſt the <hi>Cadets,</hi> except the principal houſe, which he calls <hi>Vol de chapon,</hi> our Buz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardly Author of a French Capon, hath made a long-wing'd Hawk. For what he calls <hi>moſt part of</hi> the Kingdom, is particular to <hi>Paris</hi> only, as with us in <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Kent</hi> formerly, (I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe by reaſon of the Traders) the Iſle of <hi>France, Limouſin, Xantonge,</hi> and it may be ſome one Province more, which poſſibly I have not remembred.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee, Couſin, how our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor <hi>augments,</hi> or <hi>diminiſheth, changetth</hi> or <hi>diſguiſeth</hi> the truth of things, as they make moſt convenient for his purpoſe, and what little <hi>credit</hi> ought to be given
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:53230:146"/>
to him. We ſhall therefore take no more notice of <hi>France.</hi> For his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes being demonſtrably falſe, his conſequence whatſoever it be, cannot hold good.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Delphick Oracle</hi> did never impoſe Laws more peremptorily to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> than <hi>Plato Red.</hi> would arrogantly obtrude his private opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon us; for notwithſtanding <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Laws</hi> are againſt him, yet he <hi>alone</hi> would pretend to deveſt the King of this his undoubted Prerogative.</p>

<pb n="286" facs="tcp:53230:152"/>
                     <hi>Commonwealth.</hi> For if Rebellion doth not proſper, then <hi>Government</hi> in this place ſignifies the <hi>Law of the Land;</hi> and indeed, the King's authority over us is eſtabliſh'd by the <hi>Law,</hi> that is to ſay, the conſent and acknowledgment of the People in due form, That the King hath <hi>inherently, antecedently,</hi> and by <hi>Birth-right,</hi> a <hi>Soveraign authority</hi> over all his people, and this is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd to him, both by <hi>Statute, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law</hi> and <hi>Cuſtom,</hi> according to that of 19. <hi>H. 6. 62.

                  <p>But ſince we are ſo plainly aſſured of his meaning, I'll take the liberty for once, to put it plainly into words, and I think it will then run thus: That our King, having neither by <hi>birthright,</hi> nor by a long undoubted <hi>Succeſſion</hi> of above ſix hundred years, any Authority of his own, but only that which the <hi>people</hi> have intruſted in him, (<hi>for they would give him no more, than what was juſt neceſſary to govern them, p.</hi> 119.) the people, in whom the Soveraign power reſides, may call this their <hi>miniſter,</hi> otherwiſe called King, to an <hi>account</hi> for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of this his <hi>truſt;</hi> and in caſe he ſhould not acquit himſelf, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their expectation, the <hi>Soveraign Subject</hi> might puniſh this their <hi>Subject King, turn him out of his office,</hi> as all <hi>Supreme</hi> governours may their <hi>ſubordinate</hi> officers, nay and ſet

up any other form of Government whatſoever, without doing any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of injuſtice to their King.</p>
                  <p>This is our Authors doctrine, as appears not only by inevitable conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, drawn from this <hi>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

they <hi>eſtabliſh'd their government in theſe parts after their conqueſt, p.</hi> 93.

                  <p>Here we ſee our Country conquer'd, and an excellent form of Government eſtabliſh'd by the <hi>Goths,</hi> ſo good, and admirably juſt, that we in this age muſt quit our happy Monarchy, which hath ſubſiſted moſt gloriouſly many Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of years, only to run a <hi>wool-ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering</hi> after theſe <hi>precarious Gothick</hi> Princes, and yet no man could ever tell us <hi>when</hi> this conqueſt happen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d, nor <hi>by whom,</hi> nor <hi>what</hi> became of them, nor indeed any thing more, than what the extravagant fancy of our Author hath imagin'd.</p>

to be called <hi>Northern</hi> people, by us at leaſt, who lye ſo much <hi>North</hi> to them our ſelves.</p>

                  <p>We will imagine then that our <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> were of the <hi>race</hi> of the <hi>Goths,</hi> and that (retaining their cuſtoms) They introduc'd many of them amongſt us, ſuch as might be the <hi>diviſion of the lands,</hi> into ſeveral <hi>Feuds,</hi> which they called <hi>Thane</hi> lands, (and were like our <hi>Mannors</hi> or <hi>Lordſhips</hi>) under certain <hi>Tenures</hi> or <hi>Services.</hi> Many alſo they might have found amongſt the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi> and retain'd them under their own Government: for it is certain the <hi>Britains</hi> held lands by ſeveral Tenures,

but whether they were originally of their own Inſtitution, or the remains of the <hi>Roman Clientela's,</hi> and <hi>Praeda militaria,</hi> I will not determine.</p>
                  <p>I have already told you, that the <hi>Goths</hi> upon their firſt Tranſplantation, and after they were ſetled in their new poſſeſſions, were govern'd by Kings, whoſe power encreas'd <hi>deſpotically,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the people grew ſecure and civiliz'd, and ſo they continued above a thouſand years; nor do I find that the people in all this time pretended to any other ſhare in the government, than to <hi>meet</hi> in <hi>General Councils,</hi> when the affairs of the Kingdom oblig'd <hi>their King</hi> to aſſemble them. And truly I ever thought ſuch <hi>National Aſſemblies,</hi> when well regulated, very conducible to the ſecurity, and happy ſubſiſtence of all Governments, and ſuch our antient Monarchs have thought fit to make uſe of, and have tranſmitted the cuſtom of convoking ſuch Councils, which we not call Parliaments, even to our days. But that theſe Counſellors ſhould have any right of command, is ſo contrary
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:53230:156"/>
to the deſign of their Inſtitution, that as this muſt needs be dangerous to the Government it ſelf, ſo they make their good Inſtitution uſeleſs, by rendring themſelves ſuſpected to the King, who alone hath the right to aſſemble them. For what wiſe Magiſtrate, would by his own authority raiſe a power, which he apprehends might <hi>ſhock</hi> his own.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>ſad</hi> effects of this, we have ſeen of late days among our ſelves, when our Commoners in Parliament, who were meer Counſellors, and no more, or <hi>Repreſentatives</hi> with a power to <hi>conſent,</hi> have arrogated to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a Soveraign authority, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that pretence, have forceably and violently ſubverted our antient Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and deſtroyed our <hi>Lawful and Natural Governour himſelf,</hi> and have beſides, of late, ſpent ſo much time in unneceſſary new diſputes concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own rights and prerogatives, <hi>which really do not much concern us,</hi> that they have totally neglected thoſe main ends of their meeting, which are the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity</hi> of our Government, under our <hi>Lawful Soveraign,</hi> and the <hi>peace</hi> and
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:53230:157"/>
                     <hi>happineſs</hi> of his people, and which are the only bleſſings and benefits, which we deſire of them.</p>
                  <p>Nay, they have been ſo far from procuring thoſe advantages for us, to which purpoſes they have been ſolely entruſted by us, that their diſputes concerning the Succeſſion to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> which is <hi>indiſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;</hi> The <hi>Right</hi> which the King hath to <hi>borrow money upon good Security,</hi> which was never taken from the <hi>pooreſt</hi> of his Subjects; ſhewing mercy upon unfortunate offenders, which is his <hi>Nature,</hi> as well as undoubted Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and ſeveral ſuch other irregular Heats and Animoſities, are the moſt <hi>apparent</hi> cauſes of our preſent horrid <hi>Conſpiracies, troubles</hi> and <hi>diſtractions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to return to our <hi>Goths,</hi> I have told you, that after their diviſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—thoſe that ſpread toward the Weſt and Southern parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> were in a continual ſtate of war, and ſo their King was but their General, whom ſometimes they did depoſe or continue, according as they found him capable of that great employment, upon whoſe
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:53230:157"/>
conduct, in their dangerous circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, their Lives and Fortunes did chiefly depend, and ſuch in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects was the caſe of our <hi>Saxons</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Heptarchy here in <hi>England.</hi> All the world knows that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded us without any pretence of title, being only call'd in as <hi>friends</hi> by <hi>Vor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigern,</hi> the Britiſh King, to aſſiſt him againſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> and by degrees en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching upon the <hi>Britains,</hi> they erected ſeveral Kingdoms, until at length the Native Inhabitants were totally over-power'd.</p>
                  <p>But this made very little alteration in their affairs; for wanting a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon enemy, they were always quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling amongſt themſelves, uſurping upon one another, untill their ſeveral little Governments were united under <hi>one Soveraign</hi> Monarch, who was <hi>Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> as ſome write, or <hi>Alfred</hi> the eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth King of the <hi>Weſt-Saxons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>`Tis true, that during<note place="margin">Vide Chron. Sir <hi>R Baker.</hi>
                     </note> their Heptarchy, <hi>they choſe one amongſt themſelves, who was the Supreme head of the reſt, and was call'd King of</hi> Engle-lond. And it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:53230:158"/>
that eight of the <hi>Mercian</hi> Kings, in a continued ſucceſſion, kept the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Crown of the Heptarchy. But it was rather a titular honour, than a Soveraign right of Government, and I do not find, but that every particular King in his own Province, did gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally exerciſe thoſe two great <hi>Regali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> of <hi>making Laws,</hi> and <hi>levying Taxes,</hi> by vertue of his own authority. But whether they did or not, it is little to our purpoſe, ſince we have no reaſon to follow the examples of thoſe <hi>petty</hi> Kings and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers,</hi> eſpecially when we conſider their circumſtances. But if we muſt lay aſide the form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ſince the <hi>Norman</hi> conqueſt, from whence our <hi>Aera</hi> begins, and concerning which our Hiſtories are more certain and Authentick, let us then rather conſult the Adminiſtration of thoſe <hi>Weſt-Saxons,</hi> who <hi>ſolely</hi> and Soveraignly enjoy'd the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> And not to be too tedious, we will ſix upon King <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor,</hi> the laſt (except <hi>Harold</hi>) of our <hi>Engliſh Saxon</hi> Kings. I ſhall not trouble you with much neither concerning
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:53230:158"/>
him, becauſe you may find at large whatever can be ſaid of him, in our own <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hiſtories. I ſhall only therefore make this remark, that we have had no Kings ſince <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror, nor was he himſelf, more <hi>abſolute,</hi> than King <hi>Edward</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor was.</p>
                  <p>I remember nothing of his impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but rather believe there might have been none during his reign, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I find that he remitted to his people the yearly Tribute of 40000 <hi>l.</hi> that had been gathered by the name of <hi>Danegelt.</hi> But for Laws which now are made by Act of Parliament, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve no ſuch Parliamentary way of proceedings in his days. It is true, that he called a Councel, or <hi>Wittena Gemote</hi> (which ſome call very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly a Parliament, eſpecially as it is now underſtood) in the ſecond year of his Reign, but the Commoners were ſo far from having any right of power, that their preſence was not really ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. <hi>Minores laici non ſammoneri debent, ſed ſi eorum praeſentia neceſſaria fuerit,</hi> &amp;c. Which ſhews plainly, that
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:53230:159"/>
they might be omitted. Nay although they were ſummoned and did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, nevertheleſs the Parliament was taken to be full without them. Which is a ſufficient proof, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, were not ſo much as an eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial part of the Parliament; and it is certain that <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor took the ſame courſe about his Laws, as the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> formerly had done, the firſt fetching their inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> and the latter from the <hi>Greeks.</hi> So King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> having gathered together the Laws of the <hi>Mercians, Weſt Saxons, Danes,</hi> and <hi>Northumbrians,</hi> he ſelect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the beſt, and compiled them into one body, which (being approved in Council<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="301" facs="tcp:53230:159"/>
Supreme authority, at that time, any more than afterwards.</p>
                  <p>But however I cannot believe, that their example is any argument for us, to forſake the preſent conſtitution of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Monarchy, to hunt after the <hi>polity</hi> of an <hi>Invader,</hi> who with his Succeſſors enjoyed not the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>fiftieth part</hi> ſo long, as the <hi>Norman</hi> Line hath done.</p>
                  <p>Now, Couſin, you ſee what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of thoſe great expectations which we might have had, from the noiſe and buſtle, which our Author makes of the <hi>Northern polities,</hi> and their <hi>exact rules</hi> of Government, but ſo it falls out, that in our days, <hi>moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> are no leſs apt to bring forth <hi>mice,</hi> than formerly. And that when there is a great <hi>cry,</hi> there is not always the more <hi>wooll.</hi> For in this caſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his undeniable Aphoriſm, though it may <hi>poſſibly</hi> be true, that the <hi>Saxons</hi> made ſome diviſion of the Lands amongſt the people (for our preſent diviſion of Lands and Tenures alſo, were generally made and inſti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tuted by the <hi>Normans</hi>) yet they re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tained

                  <p>Sir, I am obliged to you for remembring me, of what I had read before, but could not apply it ſo well to our preſent purpoſe, as you have done. But believing that you are clearly in the right, I ſhall not trouble you any farther concerning thoſe <hi>Northern polities,</hi> but deſire that you would proceed, and let me know what you mean by the <hi>rational part.</hi>

                  <p>By the <hi>rational part,</hi> I mean this, that granting all to be true, which our Author hath affirmed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thoſe <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Northern</hi> people, and that in the <hi>original</hi> conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of our Government, the people had a <hi>ſhare</hi> in the Supreme Authority, and that the prerogative, which our King at preſent lawfully poſſeſſes, hath been by degrees <hi>gained</hi> from the people. (All which is ſo notoriouſly falſe, that on the contrary, the people have <hi>lately encroached</hi> upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative), yet I ſay at <hi>this</hi> time, and as our <hi>preſent</hi> circumſtances ſtand, it is more <hi>rational,</hi> that all <hi>honeſt</hi> and

And ſuppoſing we were at liberty, to <hi>chooſe</hi> what form of Government we pleaſed, rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue it a <hi>Monarchy</hi> as it is, than ſet up ſuch a Democratical form, or <hi>phantaſtical</hi> model, as our Author, (having ſtoln it in a great meaſure, from the propoſitions of the Rebels ſent to the late King in the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Wight,</hi> and the tranſactions of Forty Eight) hath propoſed to us.</p>

                  <p>The performance of this, Sir, will be ſuch a full ſatisfaction to us all, that nothing will remain far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for our conſideration, but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive a means, how we may better ſecure our preſent Government, and by enacting <hi>farther good</hi> Laws, if ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, with a <hi>ſtrict execution</hi> of them, reduce our <hi>peſtilent</hi> Republican <hi>diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>

                  <p>I thank you, Sir, for putting me in mind of it, but indeed I thought, you had by this time ſufficiently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, how to diſtinguiſh a <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian,</hi> or otherwiſe Phanatical Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth man's publick declaration, from his more private meaning. I muſt therefore mind you of this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation by the way, that I never yet met with any of thoſe Authors who was not demonſtrably a <hi>wilful, malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Knave in his writings.</hi> But truly in this caſe, I think, our Author is <hi>frank</hi> and <hi>plain</hi> enough.

He tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 182. That <hi>our preſent eſtate inclines to popularity,</hi> and I do not find, but that he inclines as much to comply with our eſtate as they could<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wiſh, but let us come to his declaration againſt it, where he <hi>proteſts</hi> that he <hi>hates the thoughts of wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Commonwealth,</hi> but yet inſinuates, from the <hi>ſtory</hi> of <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> his firing the <hi>Grecian</hi> ſhips, That <hi>nothing could be more advantagious and profitable for us,</hi> which ſurely ſhews his good incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations plain enough.

                  <p>But now, he gives us the reaſon, why he cannot think of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, becauſe (conſcientious good man) he is loth to break his <hi>oath of obedience to a Lawful King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But for this <hi>Lawful King himſelf,</hi> it is no matter if he be <hi>perjur'd</hi> to the very bottom of deſtruction, who having no leſs <hi>ſworn,</hi> and that ſolemnly too,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:53230:162"/>
to <hi>maintain the antient Monarchical</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as at preſent by Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed and eſtabliſh'd, with all the <hi>rights</hi> and <hi>prerogatives</hi> belonging to the <hi>Imperial Crown</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> may <hi>break</hi> all, <hi>betray</hi> his poor Subjects, their <hi>rights</hi> and <hi>liberties,</hi> abandon them to the mercy of <hi>unmerciful</hi> Tyrants, and be <hi>damn'd</hi> if he pleaſes. Nay our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor kindly <hi>adviſes</hi> him to it, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than his curſed project ſhould fail, he <hi>perſwades him,</hi> it is <hi>the beſt thing he can do.</hi> Whereas it is plain, That the power of the Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is reſtrained or limited (as we may ſay) in nothing more conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, than this, viz. <hi>That they cannot by their own Grant ſever their Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives from the Crown, nor communicate any part thereof to any one, no not to the Princes their eldeſt Sons,</hi> as may be ſeen more at large in Sir <hi>J. Davies,</hi> upon Impoſitions, <hi>cap.</hi> 29. beſides many other good Authors. Nay more, he tells us there, <hi>That neither the Kings Acts, nor any Act of Parliament, can give away his Prerogative;</hi> and farther, <hi>that no Act of Parliament in the Negative,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:53230:162"/>
can take away the Kings Prerogative in the Affirmative.</hi> Yet notwithſtanding this, (and ten times more that may be ſaid to this purpoſe,) our King is <hi>adviſed</hi> and <hi>perſwaded,</hi> nay, almoſt <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated</hi> (as our Author would have it) not only to quit ſome One of his Prerogatives, but (to make ſhort work) to releaſe, and give them up all at once.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, let us conſider <hi>Plato</hi>'s excellent new model it ſelf, and here (like a wiſe Politician) he hath made Three co-ordinate powers in <hi>being</hi> at the ſame time, that is to ſay, King, Lords, and Commons.</p>
                  <p>I confeſs, for the King, he ſays little of him, and with great reaſon, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he ſignifies nothing more than a Cypher, which, as in Arithmetick, is only to make the Commons more valuable.</p>
                  <p>But to do our Author right, he hath yet a farther uſe to make, of this his otherwiſe uſeleſs Prince; that is to ſay, whileſt neither <hi>his own Right,</hi> nor <hi>his Power,</hi> nor <hi>our Laws</hi> can ſecure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; his Name nevertheleſs is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve

theſe <hi>his Maſters.</hi> With <hi>that</hi> they hope to prevent all <hi>oppoſition,</hi> and <hi>civil wars</hi> at home. For ſhould they force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably depoſe <hi>him,</hi> they juſtly apprehend, that his <hi>Loyal</hi> Subjects in <hi>England,</hi> would endeavour to <hi>revenge</hi> ſuch an <hi>inſupportable wrong.</hi> Nor can they believe that the Kingdoms of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> would again <hi>tamely</hi> ſubmit their Necks to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile yoke of a few ambitious, <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commoners; or that foreign Princes themſelves, would even for their own ſecurities ſake, <hi>quietly,</hi> and <hi>unconcern'd,</hi> countenance this horrid <hi>injuſtice,</hi> and <hi>outrage</hi> done to the <hi>ſacred dignity</hi> of Kings. But if they can perſwade his Majeſty <hi>willingly to depoſe</hi> himſelf, and at the ſame time <hi>diſinherit</hi> his Heirs and Succeſſors, they imagine that none can pretend to diſapprove, much leſs blame, or impute to them, the <hi>volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> act of a King.

of the Parliament, by which he tells us, that he ever underſtood, <hi>the King, Lords and Commons,</hi> ſo that neither his <hi>Militia</hi> nor <hi>Revenue,</hi> can be ſaid to be ſo abſolutely taken <hi>from himſelf,</hi> as granted <hi>to the Parliament</hi> in general, of which he is ſtill to be <hi>the head.</hi>

                  <p>Ah, Couſin, there is deadly poiſon in this his varniſhed treacherous Cup, and you will eaſily perceive it, when you conſider, <hi>Plato</hi> cares not ſo much, that the <hi>Militia</hi> ſhould be in the <hi>power</hi> of the Commons, as <hi>out</hi> of the King. For whileſt the King can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſpoſe of it, without the <hi>conſent</hi> of his <hi>Lower Houſe,</hi> judge you, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will ever agree to the raiſing any <hi>force,</hi> which they ſhall not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves command.</p>
                  <p>If then any difference ariſe, upon that, or any other point, (which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably, and deſignedly will happen) then are the Commoners become im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately <hi>maſters</hi> of all. For what can the King do, though joyn'd with the Houſe of Lords, without a <hi>right of command</hi> or <hi>force,</hi> againſt a <hi>multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi> and that ſo unequal too, that (if
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:53230:164"/>
the Houſe of Commons in Parliament, repreſent the whole Nation, as they pretend they do) then are they at leaſt <hi>ten thouſand men</hi> againſt <hi>one,</hi> though all the <hi>Nobility</hi> be included with the King. The neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of all this muſt be, that if on the one hand, the King and Lords, agree with the Commons in <hi>all things,</hi> then the Commons govern more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, than if there were neither the <hi>one</hi> nor the <hi>other,</hi> becauſe there is no <hi>pretence</hi> againſt them.</p>
                  <p>On the other hand, if they in any thing <hi>differ</hi> from the Commons, then undoubtedly the diſagreeing Lords, as <hi>formerly,</hi> ſhall be turned out of doors, the King ſet aſide, and the <hi>Votes</hi> made by the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, <hi>Jan.</hi> 4. 1648, revived and confirmed, which being very ſhort, but plain, I ſhall here repeat. Firſt, <hi>That the people, under God, are the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of all juſt power;</hi> Secondly, <hi>That the Commons of England aſſembled in Parliament, being choſen by, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the people, have the Supreme Authority of this Nation;</hi> Thirdly,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:53230:165"/>
                     <hi>That whatever is enacted, and declared for Law by the Commons of England aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled in Parliament, hath the force of a Law;</hi> Fourthly, <hi>That all the people of this Nation are included thereby, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the conſent and concurrence of the</hi> King and Houſe of Peers, <hi>be not had thereunto.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What think you now, Couſin, of theſe <hi>four Votes,</hi> even whilſt the King and Lords were yet in <hi>being.</hi> Do they not look, as if they deſigned a Commonwealth, or rather to eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh an <hi>arbitrary</hi> Tyrannical <hi>power,</hi> in the Houſe of Commons, and yet their propoſitions all along to the King, were the ſame, which <hi>Plato</hi> hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain offered us, that is, <hi>leaving the Militia, the publick revenue, nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of officers,</hi> and ſuch like to the Parliament, by which was always meant, <hi>King, Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons.</hi> This is the politick web, which our Author pretends to have ſpun out of his own ſhallow brains, and indeed it is ſo very wondrous <hi>thin,</hi> that if our preſent Stateſmen could not with half an eye, ſee through it, I ſhould
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:53230:165"/>
be apt to agree, with our Author, <hi>p.</hi> 22. that <hi>they ought in conſcience to excuſe themſelves, from that ſublime imployment, and betake themſelves to callings more ſuitable to their capacities,</hi> as Shoomakers, Tailors, and ſuch other mechanick profeſſions.</p>

                  <p>Sir, the Sun at noon day is never more clear, than that he deſigns, <hi>at beſt,</hi> a Commonwealth. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed where three co-ordinate powers are in being at the ſame time, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible they ſhould continue long in that ſtate, but ſome one or two muſt certainly in time over balance, and get the advantage of the other. I think <hi>Lucan</hi> confirmed this long ago, when he ſaid,</p>

                  <p>And the King having neither <hi>power, ſtrength, money</hi> nor <hi>officers,</hi> it is ten thouſand to one, as you obſerve, on the Commons ſide, who are <hi>actually</hi> poſſeſſed of <hi>all.</hi> Pray therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, and let us know, why in <hi>reaſon</hi>

                  <p>I mean, Sir, amongſt other things, that men, eſpecially of late, have taken to themſelves the liberty of <hi>reflecting upon,</hi> or <hi>calumniating</hi> the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> and our <hi>Governours,</hi> as alſo to <hi>ſlander</hi> one another, with ſo much bitterneſs and cunning, that we are ready to be deſtroy'd before we know any thing of the matter.

                  <p>Yes, men who are only <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent</hi> bold fellows, and have not the skill to <hi>cut a feather,</hi> very often dance themſelves into that <hi>nooſe.</hi> But to be ſerious, really, Couſin, methinks, that <hi>calumniating</hi> is a moſt pernicious <hi>liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> for in my opinion, men ſhould ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>accuſe judicially</hi> or not at all.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt caſe, the accuſed hath, we ſuppoſe, a <hi>fair Trial,</hi> at which he may make his defence, and if he prove innocent, will be freed.

from all. And at length the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, having crept through thoſe with whom you might have occaſion to converſe, you find your ſelf generally <hi>condemn'd,</hi> before you know of <hi>what,</hi> or by <hi>whom</hi> you were <hi>accuſed;</hi> and in truth <hi>Brinvillers</hi> were more tolerable in any Government, than theſe <hi>peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Calumniators.</hi>

                  <p>Indeed, Couſin, you have ſpoke a great deal of reaſon, and I am perſwaded, that the immediate cauſe of our diſtractions, proceeds from the <hi>malicious Calumnies</hi> of a few <hi>knaves,</hi> who know they <hi>lye</hi> diſpers'd amongſt a great many <hi>fools,</hi> who think they <hi>ſpeak truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Publiſher of the divine <hi>Machia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels</hi> Prince, is very juſt in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, telling us, that in all good Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, Calumniators ought to be reſtrain'd, and puniſh'd by the ſtricteſt ſeverity: <hi>Qui Rempublicam recte inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuere velit, ferri nullo modo debent ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniae, ſed puniendi ſunt calumniatores. Quodſi hiſce rebus in Republica non rectè proſpectum ſit, multa mala patrantur, unde ſeditiones &amp; turbae ortum habent.</hi>
                     <pb n="319" facs="tcp:53230:168"/>
And concludes with the ſtory of <hi>Furius—Camillus,</hi> who having gain'd a great deal of honour amongſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> for the good ſervice which he had done, in freeing them from the imminent danger of the <hi>Gauls: Manli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Capitolinus, envying</hi> above all, his great reputation, endeavour'd by all means to leſſen his credit. But finding the Senate and Nobility firm in their good opinion concerning <hi>Camillus,</hi> he then apply'd himſelf to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty, who being ever the moſt ſuſceptible of <hi>falſe</hi> impreſſions, were continually plied with the falſe aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the envious <hi>Manlius,</hi> inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting amongſt other things, that the vaſt ſum of money, which was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have been paid the <hi>Gauls,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained yet in a great meaſure, in the poſſeſſion of <hi>Camillus,</hi> and the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, who appropriating to their uſe, what was ſaid to have been paid their enemies, inſtead of Governours and Protectors, became themſelves the greateſt enemies the people had, by endeavouring to ſupport their own luxury, at the expence of the peoples

Whereas, if that mony were again diſtributed, (as in juſtice it ought) amongſt the poor Citizens, it would make their preſent condition much more eaſie, than otherwiſe it was like to be in a great many years. Intereſt is the <hi>great wheel,</hi> that moves all the world, either to <hi>good or evil</hi> actions. The Commonalty thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In the mean time the Senate, perceiving this growing miſchief, to obviate any farther diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance, they create a Dictator, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to examine into the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and puniſh the offender, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he ſhould find the offence.

                  <p>Certainly, nothing would conduce more to our quiet, than that the <hi>liberty of the preſs</hi> ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd.

                  <p>That anſwer is, I think, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſatisfie any reaſonable man. However we will ſpeak ſomewhat more particularly concerning this matter, as we find it recorded in Hiſtory.</p>
                  <p>Our Author informs us in <hi>p. 110. That by our Conſtitution the Government was undeniably to be divided, between the King and his Subjects.</hi> (which (by the way) is undeniably and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly falſe: for according to our ancent Conſtitution as well under the <hi>Saxon</hi> as our <hi>Norman</hi> Kings, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment or the right of Power was originally and ſolely in our Kings) <hi>And that divers of the great men, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with that excellent Prince King Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the firſt about it, called a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and conſented to a Declaration, of the Kingdoms right in that point. So there paſſed a Law in that Parliament, that one ſhould be held every year, and
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:53230:172"/>
oftner if need be.</hi> The ſame he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms in <hi>p.</hi> 159. and in other places.</p>
                  <p>Now, Sir, if after theſe fine Speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es by thoſe <hi>great men,</hi> (whom un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly our Author could have named) to this excellent Prince, it ſhould happen at laſt, that there was <hi>no ſuch Act,</hi> during the Reign of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the firſt, what would you think of our Author?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
                  <p>In troth, Sir, it would not alter my opinion, for I already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him to be an <hi>impudent, magiſterial Impoſtor.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Trav.</speaker>
                  <p>I fear indeed he will prove ſo, for except he hath found in his politick ſearch, ſome <hi>looſe paper,</hi> that never yet came into our <hi>Statute books,</hi> we muſt conclude that he is groſsly miſtaken. For the <hi>firſt Act</hi> that is extant of that <hi>kind,</hi> was in the <hi>Fourth of Edward the Third,</hi> and the words of it are theſe: <hi>It is accorded that a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall be holden every year once, and more often if need be.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, Sir, you muſt obſerve, that this Act was made, whilſt the King was but <hi>Nineteen years of age,</hi> and
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:53230:173"/>
both himſelf and Kingdom under the care of <hi>Twelve Governours.</hi> His Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Queen Iſabel,</hi> and <hi>Roger Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> very powerful, the Governours of the Pupil King divided amongſt themſelves, and many other preſſing affairs of the Nation, oblig'd moſt people to propoſe that expedient of <hi>frequent</hi> Parliaments, as the moſt probable means to ſecure the peace, and proſperity of the Kingdom, at leaſt until the King ſhould come of <hi>riper years,</hi> and thereby many diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences be reconciled.</p>
                  <p>After this, in the <hi>Thirty ſixth year</hi> of his Reign, he called a Parliament, and wanting money, (as generally he did,) the Parliament would grant nothing, until an Act paſſed for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of former Articles and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes there expreſſed, <hi>And that for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs of divers miſchiefs and grievances, which daily happen, a Parliament ſhall be holden every year, as another time was ordained by Statute.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe are the <hi>two Statutes</hi> intended by our Author, when he tells us that the Statute of <hi>Edward the firſt, was
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:53230:173"/>
confirmed by that glorious Prince Edward the third.</hi> Whereas in truth they were both made by the ſame King, and both in a great meaſure, <hi>revoked</hi> in his own time. Having declared after the making this laſt Act, <hi>that he yielded to it, only to ſerve his own turn.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Sir, is the <hi>matter of Fact,</hi> upon which our Author builds his great pretenſions to the old conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Annual Parliaments. The firſt Act was made whilſt the King was <hi>very young,</hi> the ſecond, when he <hi>wanted money,</hi> and had <hi>Twenty ſix ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and eight pence granted him upon every ſack of wool tranſported for three years.</hi> And both firſt, and ſecond Acts were broken by ſeveral inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions before he died.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, we muſt make this remark, that a Parliament ſeldom met, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving the King ſome <hi>money,</hi> which might encourage thoſe Kings to aſſemble them oftner, than lately they have done. But the truth is, <hi>Annual Parliaments</hi> were lookt upon as ſo great a grievance to the Nation,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:53230:174"/>
that we find, that about the Tenth year of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, it was thought a great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative in the King, <hi>that he might call a Parliament once a year.</hi> And both Houſes appointed the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Gloceſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Arundell</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> to acquaint the King, that by an old Statute, <hi>the King once a year might lawfully ſummon his Court of Parliament, for reformation of corruptions and enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities within the Realm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if we conſider with our ſelves, we ſhall find, that if <hi>yearly</hi> Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were impoſed upon us, they would become grievances, equally inſupportable, as to have <hi>no</hi> Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at all.</p>
                  <p>For if the Knights, Citizens, and Burgeſſes be choſen out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey Gentlemen and Merchants, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting thoſe Countries, where they are elected, (as ſure they ought to be) what inconvenience, if not <hi>ruin,</hi> muſt it bring upon their affairs, when they ſhall be forced to run every year, a hundred or two hundred Miles from their particular domeſtick affairs, to
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:53230:174"/>
ſerve in a <hi>formal</hi> Parliament, in which it may be, the greateſt buſineſs will be, to make <hi>buſineſs</hi> for the next.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, for <hi>idle perſons,</hi> who live about Town, and have nothing to do, but to ſcrible <hi>knaviſh politicks,</hi> to the diſturbance of <hi>honeſt men,</hi> ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution might do well enough, if they could get to be choſen members. But we find from experience and Hiſtory, that in thoſe days, when <hi>Ambition</hi> and <hi>Faction,</hi> were not ſo much in <hi>vogue</hi> as at preſent, men were ſo far from making parties, to get <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> the Parliament, that many <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners,</hi> and <hi>Lords</hi> too, have petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned and been excuſed their attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, The King's, Queen's, and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce's Servants, have ſtood upon their priviledge of <hi>exemption.</hi> So <hi>James Barner</hi> was diſcharged by the King's command, <hi>Quia erat de retinentia Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis, 7. R.</hi> 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the <hi>Lord de Veſſey,</hi> in <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourths <hi>time, obtained Licence not to ſerve in Parliament du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his life.

                  <p>Couſin, I ſhall anſwer you all theſe queſtions as plain as I can. And firſt, I ſhall never believe, that <hi>true</hi> and <hi>unfeigned</hi> Religion, eſpecially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men, where the <hi>Doctrine</hi> agrees, is ever the real cauſe of any troubles, diſturbance or diſobedience to <hi>lawful</hi> authority, ſuch as is <hi>that,</hi> which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces an Act of Parliament, (even in our Authors ſence) being ſo contrary to the Doctrine and Principles of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, that I may confidently affirm, where one is, the other cannot be.</p>
                  <p>Such men therefore, who make uſe of that <hi>Sacred</hi> name, to countenance any diſquiet in the Government, ought, according to the moſt impartial judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which we can make of mens opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions by their actions, to be eſteemed
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:53230:176"/>
as men having <hi>no Religion,</hi> rather than as <hi>true Profeſſors</hi> of the Chriſtian Faith, and that they put the higheſt <hi>abuſe,</hi> and <hi>indignity,</hi> upon Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, when they make the profeſſion of <hi>their</hi> moſt <hi>peaceable</hi> doctrine, a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, mask or cloak to cover their <hi>Secular intereſt</hi> or <hi>ambition.</hi>

                  <p>Truly, Sir, for the commoner ſort of people, I am inclin'd enough to think (it may be) better of them, than they deſerve, knowing well how apt they are to be carried away <hi>with every wind of doctrine.</hi> But thoſe who are their <hi>Ringleaders,</hi> are by ſo much the more inexcuſable, by how much they take advantage of the peoples weakneſs. Yet this would be only <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious</hi> to themſelves, and <hi>puniſhable</hi> in the <hi>world to come.</hi> But their <hi>ungodly</hi> and <hi>malicious Preachers,</hi> and <hi>factious heads,</hi> mingling dexterouſly <hi>worldly

                  <p>I perceive, Sir, you have been more converſant with this ſort of
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:53230:178"/>
people, than I thought you had, for I find that you have gotten their very <hi>Cant;</hi> but you ſhall have, I hope, a very ſatisfactory anſwer. And firſt for our ſtrength, I confeſs it behoves us all to <hi>take heed leſt we fall:</hi> but if that great care be an argument againſt us, it is no leſs againſt themſelves.

                  <p>Have a care, Couſin, that you do not contradict the good account which you gave of your own Religion yeſterday. For whoſoever ſtands up for a <hi>Popiſh toleration</hi> at this time, will be ſhrewdly ſuſpected to be at leaſt <hi>Popiſhly inclin'd,</hi> if not a <hi>Papiſt.</hi>

                  <p>Sir, I again confirm what I ſaid yeſterday, nor do I tell you now, that I would have the <hi>Papiſts tolerated,</hi> it belongs to the Government to look after theſe matters, but I muſt affirm, according to my judgment, that if the queſtion be put, which may be the moſt <hi>ſafely</hi> tolerated, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> or <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> I muſt give it for the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> and I think I ſhall produce good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and authority for this my opinion.</p>

                  <p>This then ſuppoſed, I muſt affirm, that <hi>outward force</hi> is not a proper means to convince a mans reaſon of <hi>ſpeculative truths<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>If it be then neceſſary that a mans reaſon ſhould be convinc't of a ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive truth, before he can beleive it, it will follow, that thoſe who uſe <hi>vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> and <hi>force,</hi> to oblige a people to embrace an opinion, which they <hi>do</hi> not, or <hi>can</hi> not underſtand, commit either the greateſt <hi>injuſtice</hi> towards <hi>man,</hi> or the greateſt <hi>impiety</hi> toward <hi>God.</hi>

<pb n="359" facs="tcp:53230:188"/>
I am abundantly ſatisfied, with thoſe arguments, which you have produced in their favour, and do heartily wiſh, they could as well comply with the Spiritual, as I am perſwaded they will live peaceably and quietly under the Civil Government.</p>
                  <p>And as to the preſent queſtion of <hi>Toleration</hi> between the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> I perceive that the force of your argument conſiſts in this, that the Diſſenters, (beſides their more than <hi>Jeſuitical</hi> principles, moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious to Civil Government, as hath been now declared) that they (I ſay) agreeing with the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> differ chiefly concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Government,</hi> to which in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence they <hi>ought,</hi> and confeſs, they <hi>may</hi> ſubmit: but the <hi>Papiſts</hi> diſagreeing in the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>ſpeculative points,</hi> which they believe <hi>abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation,</hi> cannot poſſibly comply with us, without the <hi>apparent</hi> danger of eternal <hi>damnation.</hi> So having a more juſtifiable pretence, to differ from us in the <hi>Spiritual</hi> Government <hi>only,</hi> than the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> in either the

                     <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> or <hi>Temporal,</hi> they ought the <hi>rather</hi> of the <hi>two</hi> to be <hi>tolerated.</hi> Truly the reaſon of this is very obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of our families. For if a Maſter ſhould command two of his <hi>Sons</hi> or <hi>Servants,</hi> to go, for example, half a ſcore miles upon ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt buſineſs; and the <hi>one</hi> ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe himſelf for this reaſon, that he is <hi>certainly</hi> aſſured, or believes <hi>poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> and <hi>unfeignedly,</hi> that a company of <hi>Robbers,</hi> or a <hi>Lion</hi> is in the way, (which anſwers to <hi>Damnation,</hi> in the caſe of the <hi>Papiſts</hi>) and that he ſhall be <hi>murdered</hi> or <hi>devoured;</hi> that the other <hi>Son,</hi> or <hi>Servant,</hi> having <hi>no ſuch fears</hi> upon him, doth neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs upon ſome much more ſlight, and frivolous pretence <hi>obſtinately</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to <hi>obey</hi> the <hi>Maſter,</hi> deſiring alſo that <hi>hence forward,</hi> the <hi>Maſter would go upon his own errands himſelf,</hi> (which agrees with the <hi>condeſcenſion</hi> that the <hi>Diſſenters require</hi> from the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>) I think indeed in this caſe, though <hi>both</hi> be guilty of diſobedience, yet the <hi>former</hi> is much more <hi>excuſable,</hi> and <hi>tolerable</hi> than the <hi>latter,</hi> and that

                  <p>Having then, Sir, given me full ſatisfaction, concerning theſe <hi>three main points, viz?</hi> our <hi>Liberties, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties,</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> under our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Government; in which having found <hi>no faults negatively,</hi> we ought not to deſire any <hi>change</hi> or <hi>innovation.</hi> Yet nevertheleſs be pleaſed to let me know <hi>affirmatively</hi> why a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth might not be <hi>rationally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted</hi> and ſet up in this <hi>preſent trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome conjuncture</hi> of our <hi>affairs.</hi>

                  <speaker>Trav.</speaker>
                  <p>Let us then agree, that our Author deſigns a <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> as I have already prov'd from his <hi>own mouth.</hi> Beſides, the conſtitution of his <hi>mix'd</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment will inevitably bring it upon us, or return us again to a Monarchy, where we are. For though he doth not tell us plainly, that he deſigns <hi>totally to remove the King and Royal family,</hi> yet ſo many inconveniences will happen, that
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:53230:190"/>
as (it may be) in the beginning of the <hi>late Traiterous Aſſociation, all</hi> the Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors might not at firſt reſolve upon the <hi>barbarous murder of his Majeſty and Royal Highneſs;</hi> yet when they were once engag'd in the <hi>one,</hi> they found the <hi>other</hi> ſo neceſſary to be effected, that it was morally impoſſible to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceed in the <hi>former,</hi> until the <hi>latter</hi> was <hi>actually</hi> executed.</p>
                  <p>It being then moſt certain, that our Authors intention was to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh a Common wealth, I ſhall now give you my reaſons, why we ought not upon any terms to admit of it.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, I ſhall not inſiſt much upon thoſe vulgar inconveniences, which are viſible to all men. As for example, the inevitable conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of moſt <hi>bloudy wars.</hi> For can any rational man believe, that <hi>all</hi> the Royal family, ſhould be ſo <hi>inſenſible</hi> of their <hi>right</hi> and <hi>honour</hi> as never to puſh for <hi>three Kingdoms,</hi> which would ſo <hi>juſtly</hi> belong to them, or could they be ſuppoſed to leave <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> under their <hi>popular uſurpation;</hi>
                     <pb n="363" facs="tcp:53230:190"/>
what reaſon hath <hi>Scotland</hi> to truckle under the Domination of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Commonalty? What pretence hath the <hi>Engliſh Subject,</hi> (ſuppoſing they were to ſhare in the <hi>Engliſh Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi>) over the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland?</hi> All the world knows that <hi>that</hi> Kingdom, belongs ſo <hi>particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> to our King, that the late Rebells themſelves, did not ſcruple to call him <hi>King of the Scots.</hi> Why ſhould <hi>Ireland</hi> alſo become a Province to an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament? Or ſhould <hi>both</hi> Kingdoms be willing to ſhake off the Government of their <hi>Natural, Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> and <hi>antient Monarchy,</hi> why ſhould they not ſet up a Democracy, or an Ariſtocracy, or what elſe they pleas'd amongſt themſelves? Is there never a Stateſman in the three Kingdoms but <hi>Plato Redivivus?</hi> Can none teach them to <hi>Rebel</hi> but he? No rules to maintain an <hi>uſurpt Authority,</hi> but what we find among his extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies? I am confident you do not believe it. Shall theſe people, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly known to have <hi>hated one another,</hi> whilſt formerly they were
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:53230:191"/>
under different Governours, become the ſtricteſt friends, when they ſhall return unto thoſe circumſtances, under which they were the <hi>greateſt enemies?</hi> Will the <hi>French</hi> King take no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, (having ſo good a pretext) of our <hi>Diviſions?</hi> Or ſhould we unite againſt him, under our <hi>popular</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, was it ever known that a <hi>Confederate</hi> army was able to defend themſelves long, againſt an Army of <hi>equal</hi> ſtrength, commanded by <hi>one ſole abſolute Monarch?</hi> Can we fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee any thing, but moſt <hi>deſperate wars;</hi> and can wars be ſupported, but by moſt <hi>heavy taxes?</hi> Were not our <hi>Thimbles</hi> and <hi>Bodkins</hi> converted in the late times into <hi>Swords</hi> and <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar pieces,</hi> and by a <hi>prodigious tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation,</hi> never before heard of, were not our <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Ear-rings</hi> turn'd into a <hi>brazen Idol?</hi> Theſe conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, Couſin, and <hi>diſmal effects</hi> of a Commonwealth, beſides many other, are ſo obvious, that I ſhall not ſpend any more time to mind you of them. Suppoſing then that none of thoſe former horrid inconveniences
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:53230:191"/>
might happen, I muſt mind you by the way, that one reaſon why our Author and the <hi>Aſſociators</hi> deſire a Commonwealth, proceeds from the fear of a certain <hi>Arbitrary power,</hi> which they pretend the King would intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, as may be ſeen, <hi>pag.</hi> 161. 208<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in ſeveral other places.</p>
                  <p>Now, Though nothing be more extravagant, than ſuch a <hi>groundleſs</hi> imagination, our Author having aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured us, <hi>that his Majeſty never did one act of Arbitrary power, ſince his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py reſtoration.</hi> And moreover, <hi>pag. 176. That our laws againſt Arbitrary power, are abundantly ſufficient.</hi> Yet, that we may no more diſpute this point, I muſt produce <hi>Plato</hi>'s <hi>own</hi> authority againſt himſelf in theſe words: <hi>That the King fears his power will be ſo leſſened by degrees, that at length it will not be able to keep the Crown upon his head, pag.</hi> 208. Nay, farther in <hi>pag.</hi> 214. he ſhews us, That it is <hi>impoſſible</hi> he ſhould ever become an Arbitrary King. For his preſent power, as little as it is, is yet <hi>greater, than the condition of property can admit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> and in a word, from his beloved <hi>Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm,</hi>
                     <pb n="366" facs="tcp:53230:192"/>
and the whole courſe of his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, he endeavours to prove, that <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion being founded on the property,</hi> and the <hi>property</hi> being in the <hi>people,</hi> the King can have <hi>no manner of hopes</hi> upon earth, of becoming <hi>abſolute,</hi> nor introducing an <hi>Arbitrary Government,</hi> but by ſome Army of Angels from Heaven, who muſt procure him an Authority, which he cares not for.</p>
                  <p>The next, and <hi>main reaſon,</hi> why our Author would ſet up a Democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, at leaſt as far as I can collect, from the whole ſcope of his diſcourſe, is, becauſe <hi>the State inclines to popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, Sir, for this laſt time, I muſt make uſe of our Author's <hi>own reaſons</hi> againſt his <hi>own poſitions,</hi> and do affirm, that for <hi>this very reaſon,</hi> (were there no other) all ſober men, and true Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, ought to <hi>oppoſe</hi> with their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt endeavours, a <hi>Popular Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I will not recount to you the many <hi>miſchiefs, deſolations</hi> and <hi>deſtructions,</hi> which a <hi>popular power</hi> hath brought along with it, whereever it go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>better</hi> of the <hi>antient Eſtabliſhed Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of the place.

                  </p>
                  <p>But if the inclination of the people be ſuch, that they will take advantage of the King's <hi>want of power,</hi> and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce their <hi>own</hi> Government, what <hi>moderation</hi> may we expect from <hi>men,</hi> towards <hi>thoſe,</hi> who are to become <hi>their Subjects,</hi> who ſhaking off all ſenſe of <hi>Juſtice, Law, Religion,</hi> and <hi>temper,</hi> dare <hi>uſurp</hi> the <hi>Soveraign authority</hi> over their <hi>natural Governour?</hi> Where ſhall we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal for <hi>mercy,</hi> when having cut the throat of the <hi>moſt merciful</hi> King in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, we expoſe our <hi>own</hi> to our <hi>ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious</hi> and <hi>unmerciful Tyrants?</hi> Where
