            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Speaker,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>
                  <hi>THis days Debate is but too clear a Proof, that we Engliſhmen are right Iſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Variable and Mutable like the Air we live in. For, Sir, if that were not our Temper, we ſhould not be now Diſputing, Whether after all thoſe Hazards we have run, That Blood we have ſpilt, That Treaſure we have exhauſted, we ſhould not now ſit down, juſt where we did begin; and of our own accords, ſubmit our ſelves to that Slavery, which we have not only ventured our Eſtates and Lives, but I wiſh I could not ſay, our Souls and Conſciences, to throw off. What others, Sir, think of this Levity, I cannot tell; I mean, thoſe that ſteer their Conſciences by Occaſions, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not loſe the Honour they never had: But truly, Sir, for my own part, I dare as little not declare it, to be my Opinion, as others more prudential, dare avow it to be theirs. That we are this day making good all the Reproaches of our Enemies, owning of our ſelves Oppreſſors, Murderers, Regicides, Subverters of that, which now we do not only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to have been a Lawful Government; but by recalling it, confeſs it now to be the beſt. Which, Sir, if it be true, and that now we begin to ſee aright, I heartily wiſh, our Eyes had been ſooner open; and for three Nations ſake, that we had purchas'd our Conviction at a cheaper Rate. We might, Sir, in</hi> Forty Two, <hi>have been, what we thus contend to be in</hi> Fifty Nine; <hi>and our Conſciences have had much leſs to Anſwer for to God, and our Reputations to the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> I wiſh with all my Soul, I did ſtate our Caſe to you amiſs, and that it were the Queſtion only, <hi>Whether we would voluntarily relapſe into the Diſeaſe we were formerly poſſeſſed with, and of our own accords, take up our old Yoke, that we with Wearing and Cuſtom, had made Habitual and Eaſy, and which (it may be) 'twas more our Wantonneſs than our Preſſure, that made us throw it off.</hi> But this, Sir, is not now the Queſtion: That which we deliberate, is not, whether we will ſay, We do not care to be free, we like our old Maſters, and will now be content to have our Ears bored at the Door-poſt of their Houſe, and ſo ſerve them for ever; But, Sir, as if we were contending for Shame as well as Servitude, we are carrying our <hi>Ears to be bored</hi> at the Doors of <hi>another Houſe:</hi> A Houſe, Sir, without Name, and therefore it is but congruous it ſhould conſiſt of Members without Family: A Houſe that inverts the Order of Slavery, and ſubjects it to our Servants; and yet, in contradiction to Scripture, we do not only not think that Subjection intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but are now pleading for it. In a word, Sir, it is a Houſe of ſo incongruous and odious a Compoſition and Mixture, that certainly the grand Architect, would never have ſo framed it, had it not been his Deſign, as well to ſhew to the World <hi>the Contempt he had of us,</hi> as to demonſtrate <hi>the Power he had over us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:42651:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>Sir, <hi>That it may appear, that I intend not to be ſo imprudent (as far as my part is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned) as to make a voluntary Reſignation of my Liberty and Honour, to this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent part of his late Highneſs his laſt Will and Teſtament, I ſhall crave, Sir, the leave, to declare in a few Particulars, my Opinion of this Other Houſe; wherein I cannot but promiſe my ſelf to be favourably heard by ſome, but patiently heard by all: For thoſe Engliſhmen that are againſt this Houſe, will certainly with content hear the Reaſons, why others are ſo too: Thoſe Courtiers that are for it, give me Evidence enough to think, that in Nature there is nothing which they cannot willingly endure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, Sir, As to the Author and Framer of this Houſe of Peers; Let me put you in mind, it was he, that with reiterated Oaths, had often <hi>ſworn to be True and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the Government without it;</hi> and not only ſworn ſo himſelf, but had been the chief Inſtrument both to draw and compel others to Swear ſo too. So, Sir, that the foundation of this Noble Fabrick was laid in Perjury, and was begun with the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and Contempt, as well of the Laws of God, as of the Nation. He, Sir, that call'd Monarchy <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> in another, and indeed made it ſo in himſelf: He that Voted a Houſe of Lords <hi>dangerous and unneceſſary,</hi> and too truly made it ſo in his Partiſans: He that with fraud and force deprived you of your Liberty, when he was living, and entailed Slavery upon you at his Death: 'Tis he, Sir, that hath left you theſe worthy Overſeers of that his laſt Will and Teſtament; who, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they have behaved themſelves in other Truſts, we may be confident, they will endeavour faithfully to diſcharge themſelves in this. In a word, Sir, had this Other Houſe no other Fault, but its Inſtitution and Author, I ſhould think that Original Sin enough for its Condemnation: For I am of their Opinion that think, that for the good of Example, all Acts and Monuments of Tyrants are to be Expunged and Eraſed, that, if poſſible, their Memory might be no longer liv'd than their Carkaſſes. And the truth is, their good Laws are of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their Snares, and but baſe Brokage for our Liberty.</p>
               <p>But, Sir, to impute to this other Houſe, no other Faults but its own, you may pleaſe in the firſt place to conſider of the Power which his Highneſs hath left it, according to that <hi>humble Petition and Advice,</hi> which he was pleaſed to give Order to the Parliament to preſent unto him. For, Sir, as the Romans had Kings, ſo had his Highneſs Parliaments, amongſt his Inſtruments of Slavery; and I hope, Sir, it will be no Offence for me to pray, that his Son may not have them ſo too. But, Sir, they have a <hi>Negative Voice,</hi> and all other Circumſtances of that Arbitrary Power, which made the former Houſe intolerable; only the Dignity and Quality of the Perſons themſelves is wanting, that our Slavery may be accompanied with Ignominy and Affront. And now, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> have we not gloriouſly vindicated the Nations Liberty? Have we not worthily imployed our Blood and Treaſure, to aboliſh that Power that was ſet over us by the Law, to have the ſame impos'd upon us without a Law? And after all that Sound and Noiſe we have made in the World, of the Peoples Legiſlative Power, and of the Supremacy and Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency of their Repreſentatives; we now ſee there is no more Power left them, but what is put in the Balance, and equalled by the Power of a few Retainers of Tyranny, who are ſo far from being of the Peoples choice, that the moſt part of them are only known to the Nation by the Villainies and Miſchiefs they have committed in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:42651:2"/>In the next place, Sir, you may pleaſe to conſider, that the Perſons inveſted with this Power, are all of them nominated and deſigned by the Lord Protector; (for to ſay, <hi>by him and his Council,</hi> hath in effect no more diſtinction, than if one ſhould ſay, <hi>by Oliver, and Cromwel.</hi>) By this means the Protector himſelf, by his own and his Peers Negative, becomes, in effect, two of the three Eſtates; and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, is poſſeſs'd of two parts of the Legiſlative Power. I think this can be a doubt to no Man, that will but take the pains to read over that fair Catalogue of thoſe Noble Lords; for certainly no Man that reads their Names, can poſſibly fanſie for what other Vertues or good Qualities ſuch a compoſition ſhould be made choice of, but only the certainty of their compliance with whatſoever ſhould be enjoyned them by their <hi>Creator.</hi> (Pardon, Sir, that Name, for 'tis properly applyable, where things are <hi>made of Nothing.</hi>) Now, Sir, if in the former Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, encreaſe of Nobility was a grievance, becauſe the New Nobility, having freſh obligation to the Crown, were the eaſilier led to compliance with it: And if one of the main Reaſons for Excluſion of the Biſhops out of the Houſe of Lords, was becauſe that they being of the King's making, were, in effect, ſo many certain Votes for whatever the King had a mind to carry in that Houſe: How much more aſſured will that inconvenience now be, when the Protector, that wants nothing of the King, in every ſenſe but the Title, ſhall not only make and nominate a part, but of himſelf conſtitute the whole Houſe? In a word, Sir, if our Liberty was endangered by the former Houſe, we may give it loſt in the other Houſe: And 'tis in all reſpects, as advantageous and ſecure for the Liberty of the Nation, which we come hither to redeem, to allow this Power and Notion to his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs Officers, or Council; nay his very Chaplains, as to his other Creatures and Partiſans in his other Houſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now having conſidered, Sir, their Author, Power and Conſtitution, give me leave to make ſome few Obſervations, though but in general, of the Perſons themſelves that are deſign'd to be our Lords and Maſters; and let us ſee what either the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Quality or Qualifications are of theſe egregious Legiſlators, which may juſtifie their Choice, and prevail with the People to admit them, at leaſt, into equal Authority with the whole Repreſentative Body of themſelves. But what I ſhall ſpeak, Sir, of their Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, or any thing elſe concerning them, I would be thought to ſpeak with diſtinction, and to intend only of the Major part. For I acknowledge, Mr.</hi> Speaker, <hi>the mixture of this other Houſe to be like the Compoſitions of Apothecaries, who are us'd to mix ſomething of Reliſh, ſomething grateful to the Taſte, to qualifie their bitter Drugs, which elſe, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance, would be immediately ſpit out and never ſwallowed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So, Sir, his Highneſs, of deplorable Memory to this Nation, to countenance as well the want of Quality as Honeſty in the reſt, hath nominated ſome, againſt whom there lies no other Reproach, but only that Nomination; but not, Sir, out of any Reſpect to their Qualities, or regard to their Vertues, but with regard to the no Quality, to the no Vertues of the reſt: which truly, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> if he had not done, we could eaſily have given a more expreſs Name to his other Houſe, than he hath been pleaſed to do: For we know a Houſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd only for Beggars and Malefactors, is a <hi>Houſe of Correction,</hi> and term'd ſo by your Law. But, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> ſetting thoſe few Perſons aſide, who, I hope,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42651:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
think the Nomination a diſgrace, and the ever coming to Sit there, much a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Can we without Indignation think on the reſt? He that's firſt in their Roll, a condemn'd Coward; one, that out of fear and baſeneſs, did what he could to betray your Liberties, and does now the ſame for Gain. The ſecond, a Perſon of as little Senſe as Honeſty, preferr'd for no other reaſon, but his no Worth, his no Conſcience; except that his cheating his Father of all he had, was thought a Vertue, by him, who by ſad Experience, we find hath done as much for his Mother, his Country. The third, a Cavalier, a Presbyterian, an Independent; for a Republique, for a Protector, for every thing, for nothing, but only that one thing, <hi>Money.</hi> 'Twere endleſs to run through them all, to tell you, Sir, of their Lordſhips of Seventeen-pound Land a year of Inheritance, of their Farmer Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, Dray-men Lordſhips, Cobler-Lordſhips, without one Foot of Land, but what the Blood of Engliſh-men hath been the price of: Theſe, Sir, are to be our Rulers, theſe the Judges of our Lives and Fortunes; to theſe we are to ſtand bare, whilſt their Pageant-ſtate-Lordſhips deign to give us a conference upon their Bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> we have already had too much experience, how unſupportable Servants are, when they become our Maſters. All kind of Slavery is miſerable in the accompt of all generous Minds; but that which comes accompanied with Scorn and Contempt, ſtirs every Mans Indignation, and is indured by none, whoſe Nature does not intend for Slaves, as well as Fortune.</p>
               <p>I ſay not this, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> to revile any Man with his Meanneſs; for I never thought either the Malignity or Indulgence of Fortune, to be (with wiſe or juſt men) the Grounds either of their ill or their good Opinion. Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> I blame not in theſe Men the Faults of their Fortune, any otherwiſe, but as they make them their own: I object to you their Poverty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe it is accompanied with Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; I mind you of their Quality, becauſe they themſelves forget it. So that 'tis not the Men I am angry with, but with their Lordſhips; not with Mr. <hi>Barkſtead,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Gaoler</hi> (Titles I could well allow them) but with <hi>The Right Honourable, our ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar good Lord and Gaoler:</hi> 'Tis this incongruity, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> I am diſpleaſed with.</p>
               <p>So, Sir, that though we eaſily grant Poverty and Neceſſity to be no Faults, yet we muſt allow them to be great Impediments in the way of Honour, and ſuch as nothing but extraordinary Vertue and Merit can well remove. The Scripture reckons it among <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s great Faults, that <hi>he made Prieſts of the meaneſt of the People;</hi> and ſure it was none of the Vertues of our <hi>Jeroboam</hi> (who hath ſet up his Calves too, and would have our Tribes come up and Worſhip them) that he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the ſame Method, in making of Lords.</p>
               <p>One of the few Requeſts the <hi>Portugals</hi> made to <hi>Philip</hi> the Second of <hi>Spain,</hi> when he got that Kingdom (as his late Highneſs did this) by an Army, was, <hi>That he would not make Nobility contemptible, by advancing ſuch to that Degree, whoſe Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity or Vertue could be no way thought to deſerve it.</hi> Nor have we formerly been leſs apprehenſive of ſuch Inconveniencies our ſelves; it was in <hi>Ric.</hi> I's time, one of the Biſhop of <hi>Ely</hi>'s Accuſations, that Caſtles and Forts of Truſt, he did <hi>Obſcuris &amp; ignotis hominibus tradere,</hi> put in the hands of obſcure and unknown Men: But We, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> to ſuch a kind of Men, are delivering up the Power of our Laws, and in that the power of All.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:42651:3"/>In the 17 <hi>Edw.</hi> 4. there paſt an Act of Parliament, for the Degrading of <hi>John Nevil</hi> Marqueſs <hi>Mountague</hi> and Duke of <hi>Bedford;</hi> the Reaſon expreſt in the Act, <hi>Becauſe he had not a Revenue ſufficient for the maintaining of that Dignity,</hi> to which he added, <hi>That when Men of mean Birth are called to high Eſtate, and have no Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood to ſupport it, it induceth Briberies, Extortions, and all kind of Injuſtices that are followed by Gain.</hi> And in the Parliament of 2 <hi>Carol.</hi> the Peers in a Petition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Scottiſh and Iriſh Titles, told the King, <hi>That 'tis a Novelty without Precedent, That Men ſhould poſſeſs Honours, where they poſſeſs nothing elſe; and that they ſhould have a Vote in Parliament, where they have not a Foot of Land.</hi> But if it had been added, <hi>Sir, Or have no Land, but what is the purchaſe of their Villainies,</hi> againſt how many of our new Peers had this been an important Objection? To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, Sir, it hath been a very juſt and reaſonable care, amongſt all Nations, not to render that deſpis'd and contemptible to the People, which is deſign'd for their Reverence, and their Awe: Which, Sir, bare and empty Title, without Quality and Vertue, never procured any Man, any more than the Image in the Fable made the Aſs adored that carried it.</p>
               <p>After their Quality, give me leave, Sir, to ſpeak a word or two of their Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications; which certainly ought in reaſon to carry ſome proportion with the Employments they deſign themſelves. The Houſe of Lords, Sir, are our King's Hereditary great Council: They are the Higheſt Court of Judicature; they have their part in Judging and Determining of the Reaſons of making new Laws, and of Abrogating old: From amongſt them we take our great Officers of State; they are commonly our Generals at Land, and our Admirals at Sea: In concluſion, Sir, they are both of the Eſſence and Conſtitution of our old Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and have beſides the greateſt and nobleſt Share in the Adminiſtration. Now certainly, Sir, to judge according to the Dictates of Reaſon, one would ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine ſome ſmall Faculties and Endowments to be neceſſary for the diſcharging of ſuch a Calling; and thoſe, ſuch as are not uſually acquired in Shops and Ware-houſes, nor found by following the Plow: Now what other Academies moſt of their Lordſhips have been bred in, but their Shops; what other Arts they have been verſed in, but thoſe which more require good Arms and good Shoulders than good Heads, I think, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> we are yet to be informed. Sir, we commit not the Education of our Children to Ignorant and Illiterate Maſters; nay, we truſt not our very Horſes to unskilful Grooms: I beſeech you, Sir, let Us think it belongs to Us, to have ſome Care into whoſe Hands we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the management of the Common-wealth: And if we cannot have perſons of Birth and Fortune to be our Rulers, to whoſe Quality we would willingly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit; I beſeech you, Sir, for our Credits and Safeties ſake, let us ſeek Men, at leaſt, of Parts and Education, to whoſe Abilities we may have ſome Reaſon to give way. If, Sir, a Patient dies under a Phyſician's hand, the Law eſteems that not a Felony, but a misfortune in the Phyſician; but if one that is no Phyſician, undertakes the management of a Cure, and the Party miſcarries; the Law makes the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick a Felon, and ſure, in all Mens Opinion, the Patient a Fool. To conclude, Sir, for Great Men to Govern 'tis ordinary; for Able Men 'tis natural; Knaves many times come to it by Force and Neceſſity, and Fools ſometimes by chance:

                     </gap>heir Lordſhips. Mr.</hi> Speaker, <hi>I ſhall be as forward as any Man to declare their Services, and acknowledge them; though I might tell you, that the ſame Honour is not purchas'd by the Blood of an Enemy, but of a fellow Citizen; that for Victories in Civil Wars, till our Armies march through the City, I have not read that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours have been ſo void of Shame, as to Triumph.</hi> Caeſar <hi>not much more indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to his Country than our late Protector, did not ſo much as write publique Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of his Victory at</hi> Pharſalia, <hi>much leſs had Days of Thankſgiving to his Gods, and Anniverſary Feaſts, for having been a proſperous Rebel, and given Juſtice and his Country the worſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, Sir, I leave this Argument, and to be as good as my word, come to put you in mind of ſome of their Services, and the Obligation you owe them for the ſame. To ſpeak nothing, Sir, of one of my Lords Commiſſioners Valour at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> nor of another Noble Lords brave Adventure at the Bear-garden. I muſt tell you, Sir, that moſt of them have had the Courage to do things, which (I may boldly ſay) few other Chriſtians durſt have ſo adventured their Souls to have attempted: They have not only ſubdued their Enemies, but their Maſters, that raiſed and maintained them; they have not only Conquered <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> but Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious <hi>England</hi> too; and there ſuppreſt a Malignant Party of Magiſtrates and Laws. And that nothing ſhould be wanting to make them indeed compleat Conquerors, (without the help of Philoſophy) they have even Conquered themſelves. All Shame they have ſubdued, as perfectly as all Juſtice; the Oaths they have taken, they have as eaſily digeſted, as their old General could him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; publique Covenants and Engagements, they have trampled under-foot: In concluſion, ſo entire a Victory they have over themſelves, that their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences are as much their Servants, as, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> we are. But, Sir, give me leave to conclude with that which is more admirable than all this, and ſhews the confidence they have of themſelves and us: After having many times tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled on the Authority of the Houſe of Commons, and no leſs than five times diſſolv'd them, they hope for thoſe good Services to the Houſe of Commons, by the Houſe of Commons, to be made a Houſe of Lords. I have been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, Sir, for which I crave your pardon, therefore in a word I conclude. I beſeech you, let us think it our Duty to have a care of two things: Firſt, That Villainies be not encouraged with the Rewards of Vertue: Secondly, That the Authority and Majeſty of the Government of this Nation be not defiled, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to Contempt, by committing ſo conſiderable a part of it, to Perſons of as mean Quality as Parts.</p>

                  </gap> us, There was a State in <hi>Italy,</hi> an Ariſtocracy, where the Nobility ſtretcht their Prerogative too high, and preſumed a little too much upon the Peoples Liberty and Patience; whereupon the Diſcontents were ſo general, and ſo great, that they apparently tended to a Diſſolution of Government, and the turning of al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

At the ſame time, beſides theſe Diſtempers at home, there was a Potent Enemy ready to fall upon them from abroad, that had been an over-match for them at their beſt Union, but now in theſe Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, was like to find them very Ready, and very eaſy Prey: A wiſe Man, Sir<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the City, that did not at all approve of the Inſolency of the Nobility, and as little liked Popular Tumults, bethought himſelf of this Stratagem, to cozen his Country into ſafety. Upon a pretence of Counſel, he procured the Nobility to meet all together; which when they had done, he found a Way to lock all the Doors upon them; goes away himſelf, and takes the Keys with him: The<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> he immediately Summons the People; tells them, that by a Contrivance of his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he had taken all the Nobility in a Trap; That now was the time for them to be revenged upon them for all their Inſolencies; that therefore they ſhould imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately go along with him, and diſpatch them.

               <p>He begins and nominates one, a Man highly cried up in the Popular Faction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a confiding Man, one of much Zeal, little Senſe, and no Quality; you may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him, Sir, a zealous Cobler: The People in concluſion murmured at this and were loath their fellow Mutineer, for no other Vertue but Mutining, ſhould come to be advanced to be their Maſter; and by their Looks and Murmur, ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently expreſt the Diſtaſte they took at ſuch a Motion. Then he nominates another
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42651:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as mean a Mechanick as the former; you may imagine him, Sir, a buſtling rude Dray-man, or the like: He was no ſooner named, but ſome burſt out a laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, others grew Angry and railed at him, and all Deteſted and ſcorn'd him. Upon this, a Third was named for a Lordſhip, one of the ſame Batch, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way fit to ſit with the other two. The People then fell into a confuſed laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and noiſe, and enquired if ſuch were Lords, who (by all the Gods) would be content to be the Commons?</p>
               <p>Sir, let me be bold (by the good leave of the other Houſe and yours) to ask the ſame Queſtion? But, Sir, to conclude this Story, and with it I hope the other Houſe: When this wiſe Man I told you of, perceived they were now ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the inconvenience and miſchief they were running into, and ſaw that the pulling down their Rulers, would prove in the end, but the ſetting up of their Servants; he thought them then prepared to hear Reaſon, and told them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>You ſee,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>That as bad as this is, we cannot, for any thing I ſee, agree upon a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: What then, if after this Fright, we have put our Nobility in, and the demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we have given them of our Power, we try them once more, whether they will mend, and for the future, behave themſelves with more moderation?</hi> That People, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> were ſo wiſe, as to comply with that wiſe Propoſition, and to think it eaſier to mend their old Rulers, than to make New. And I wiſh, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> we may be ſo wiſe to think ſo too.</p>
