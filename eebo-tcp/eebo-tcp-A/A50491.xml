            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>I</hi> Had more Objections in my own thoughts to the ſending forth this Paper; and can fore-think more faults like to be found with it when ſent forth, then I ſhall now ſtand to tell thee of, or make any anſwer for. But becauſe amongſt all thoſe Objections, I met not with this, That it was impoſſible it ſhould do anie good, I thought the reſt anſwerable; and becauſe amongſt all its faults, thou canſt not (trulie) find this, That it was not intended for anie good, I perſwade my ſelf all the reſt are pardonable. What the deſign of it is, if thou art in haſte, the Title will tell thee; if thou art at leaſure, and think'ſt it worth thy while, thou may'ſt find it in the Book it ſelf; ſo ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way I might be excuſed from ſaying ought of it here. But ſomewhat for thy ſatisfaction know, when I conſidered the ſore Judgment wherewith we have been viſited, which ſo evidentlie declares Wrath to be gone forth from the Lord againſt us, I thought it might be an Eſſay verie acceptablè to God, and profitable to our ſelves, to do the beſt I could to make the voyce of the Rod Articulate; that in the print of its laſhes, not onlie Gods Wrath, but the ſin he ſcourgeth us for, and the duty he would drive us to, might be found in legible Characters, that even he that runs may read them. When I lookt on Affliction as a Medicine for a diſtempered Nation, I thought it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding neceſſarie, in order to its kindlie working with us, to tell the nature, import and uſe of it; and to give directions how it ought to be received. And though I acknowledge my ſelf the meaneſt of Ten thouſand for ſo great a Work, yet when I ſaw or heard of nothing ſo particular and diſtinct, as I thought the matter required, humblie depending upon, and imploring Divine aſſiſtance, I made this attempt; wherein, whil'ſt I have guided my ſelf by the Phyſitians own Rules, and an impartial conſideration of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Patient, I hope I have made no material (I am ſure no wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful) miſtakes. This then was my great deſire and hope, to be by this under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, a worker together with Gods Providence for ſome good to the Nation. And ſurely no man hath cauſe to be angry with this intention, or with any thing that flows ſincerelie from it. Had anie man, though the meaneſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the People, in the time when <hi>Nineveh</hi> was threatned with deſtruction, given in a Catalogue of thoſe ſins they were guiltie of, the removal of which could onlie prevent their Ruine; I am perſwaded his endeavours would have
<pb facs="tcp:54206:3"/>
been grateful to the Prince, his Nobles, and the People, though he had ſpoke to them all with more plainneſs and boldneſs, than I have done. And I dare confidentlie expect the ſame, if our Faſting and Prayers be not onlie for faſhion-ſake, but in as good earneſt as theirs.</p>
            <p>Two great miſcarriages moreover I was prone to fear the moſt would be guiltie of, which I have especiallie conſulted against. The firſt, of being ſwallowed up ſo much with a ſenſe of their Suffering, as to be indiſpoſe for all profitable Reflections; and therefore fain would I turn mens eyes and thoughts from off this, to the ſin that brought it; and have them onlie to conſider the former, ſo much as to inform themſelves more clearlie of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil of the latter. Oh what Out-cryes we may hear up and down, what dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful times theſe are! So manie Thouſands dead this Week, ſo manie another! The Plague got to this Town, and then to that! All Trading, as well as Perſons, dead and gone! But were People formerly thus affected, whilſt we were bringing this upon our ſelves? Did they cry out then, Oh how manie Thouſand Oaths are ſworn in a Week? And how manie Lyes told? How manie Thouſands Drunk, and how manie commit Lewdneſs? Had we had Weeklie Bills of ſuch Sins brought in, they would far have exceeded the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt Sums that ever yet the Mortalitie made. But alas! theſe with the moſt were light matters. Not half ſo manie groans and tears for theſe, nor anie ſuch complaints of them; nor did the conſideration of them make anie ſenſible alteration amongſt us. Now this I would fain obtain, to have thoſe dayes thought as much worſe than theſe; and thoſe actions as much worſe than theſe ſufferings, as the Diſeaſe is worſe than Phyſick; and a Childs diſobedience to his Parents, worſe than his being Whip't: And he that ſhould weep out of pitie to the Child, when he ſees it laſh't; and yet could be content to hear him revile and abuſe his father, I ſhould think to be a perſon of more Fondneſs, than Diſcretion; and for him to be more concerned for the Childs Smart, than the Parents Honor, argues him to have no true love for either.</p>
            <p>And here by the way let me give a Caution, <hi>viz.</hi> That no man bewray ſo much follie as to argue, That becauſe in mercie God may abate and remove his heavy Judgments, before manie, or perhaps any of theſe ſins I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned are put away from amongſt us; and becauſe we may have our former health and plentie reſtor'd, whilſt there is no ſuch Reformation of diſorders as I have exhorted to, that therefore our Sufferings were not intended to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſe us for thoſe ſins, nor to bring us to this Reformation. If thou be an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theist or Infidel that makeſt this Argument, who believeſt not there is a God, or that he concerns not himſelf with our Affairs, but that all things come by Nature or Chance, or I know not what, I ſhall then leave thee to receive ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction (if nothing ſooner will give it) there, where all ſuch as thou, by
<pb facs="tcp:54206:3"/>
the feeling of Divine Vengeance, are at once convinc't what the ſin is which hath deſerved it, and that there is a God who inflicts it; but if thou be a Chriſtian, then I would wiſh thee well to examine the nature of the thing, (that I mean, which thou thinkeſt God hath not puniſh't us for, becauſe it is yet continued) and upon the iſſue of that examination, paſs thy judgment. It's much to be feared thou wilt ſee Drunkards, and hear Swearers, after the Plague may be ceas't; and wilt thou think therefore that theſe, and the like Wickedneſſes, did not provoke God to afflict us? But rather ſtay, if thou art in doubt, till the great reckoning day, till thou haſt heard all mens Accounts caſt up, and thoſe Actions which are then approved confidentlie pronounce no ſins; but not all thoſe that ſurvive the heavieſt Judgments here on earth, which may be ſent to puniſh and reform thoſe that were guiltie of them; ſince hardned ſinners may fruſtrate ſome ends of an Affliction, and all are not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed here, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was. No, I ſay, do not juſtifie all ſuch Actions, though thou ſhouldſt hear them openlie defended, and applauded, and thoſe men puniſh't that dare to oppoſe and contradict them, and that oppoſition made the onlie ſin. This lower World is full of ſuch mad miſtakes and confuſions, but all will ſhortlie be ſet ſtrait.</p>
            <p>The other miſcarriages that I feared men would be apt to run into, and which I have laboured to provide againſt, was, That though they might be convinc't that ſin in the general, was the cauſe of all our miſeries, yet hardly that it was their ſin, or their friends, but ſome bodies elſe that they don't love; and ſo ſhift it off to this or that Party, whom they would have puniſh't, had they been in Gods ſtead. Such a ſtrong ſelf-love there is in everie man, that his fancie ſhapes God verie much in a likeneſs to himſelf. <hi>Even the vileſt ſinners,</hi> Pſal. <hi>50. 21. thought God ſuch an one as themſelves.</hi> And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequentlie they account themſelves, and all their Concernments dear to God, and ſo would interpret all his Providences in favour of them, to right their quarrel, and to avenge them of their enemies; for thus would they preſcribe God, might they be call<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d to his counſel. All would fain carrie it, that God is of their Partie, and againſt thoſe whom they are against; everie man will be more inclined to accuſe others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than himſelf: Nay, and hence it oft falls out, that they who have eſpouſed anie ſin, will be ſo far alone from thinking ill of it, that they'l rather accuſe the contrarie vertue; and ſo godlineſs it ſelf may ſometimes bear the blame, or however the most godlie and unblameable men. The Pillars of a<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Land ſometimes are accounted the Peſts of it, on which whilſt ſome men blind with rage, lay their hands to pluck them down, they are about to do themſelves, and the people with whom they are, the ſame courteſie that <hi>Sampſon</hi> did to the Philiſtine Lords. They who were the Salt to ſavour a corrupt World, were accounted the filth and off-ſcouring of all
<pb facs="tcp:54206:4"/>
things. <hi>Ahab</hi> will ſooner count <hi>Elijah</hi> than himſelf, a troubler of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And when anie miſchief befalls the Empire, then the poor Chriſtians muſt be thrown to the Lyons. Thus I fear amongſt us, manie bitter and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved cenſures will be paſt by one againſt another; which great ſin I have done my beſt to conſult against, whil'ſt I have chieflie laboured to bring eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man to a reflection upon himſelf; whil'ſt I have ſtudied faithfullie to deal, both to this man and that, his ſhare in procuring our miſeries; and whil'ſt I have made the Diviſions and Parties that are amongst us which occaſion this Cenſoriouſneſs, one great cauſe of our Sufferings. However one or otber may interpret what I have done, I am prettie indifferent; only I hope I have ſaid nothing, which need make anie man preſentlie fall a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting me, which, I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>le promiſe you, it's an hard thing in theſe dayes to eſcape; ſay what you will, 'tis againſt Sin onlie I have a quarrel: If any guiltie perſon (as the Phariſees when Chriſt preach't) ſhall think I mean him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let him once again know, That it is not againſt Small or Great, but the Sins of All, that I am entered into the Liſts; and I hope they'l rather ſee to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake, than vindicate them. But if otherwiſe, if leave may be granted, I dare undertake to evidence, That Sin is that which brings Suffering, and that thoſe things I have mentioned as the ſins of our Nation, are indeed ſuch. Yea, and if it be not thought Immodeſtie to foreſtall the Readers judgment, I dare add, That I have ſpoken verie great Truth and Reaſon in the matters moſt liable to Exception, notwithſtanding all the weakneſſes and diſadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in the repreſenting, which I readilie acknowledge to be manie and great. But I have alreadie exceeded the due bounds of a Preface; wherefore to conclude, Let all cenſure as they ſhall find meet; only let me make a ſolemn Profeſſion (which is the more credible from one, who hath no great reaſon to expect to out-live the General Deſolation) that, ſo far as I know my own heart, I have ſpoke nothing with a deſign to exaſperate any, or to humor and gratifie one Faction, by diſgracing or inveighing againſt another; but it hath been my care to ſpeak the very truth, according to the infallible Word of God, and the cleareſt apprehenſions of my own Soul; with an unfeigned deſire to diſcover what indeed thoſe ſins are, which we eſpeciallie ſmart for, that the inconſiderate and ignorant may be informed, the guiltie humbled, wickedneſs rooted out, God appeaſed, and all our mercies, both spiritual and temporal, reſtored and continued; and theſe deſigns ſhall be followed with my prayers: (and I hope with thine too that read'ſt me) but how far the ſucceſs may anſwer either, I must leave to the Readers improvement of, and Gods bleſſing upon my well-intended, though weak endeavours.</p>

And though in the bounteous diſpenſations of his favours, we can aſſign no higher cauſe than his own meer grace and good Will, which is accompliſh't in the doing good to his Creatures; Yet in the inflicting of Judgment which is his ſtrange work, we may be ſure to find ſomething out of himſelf mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him to it. It cannot be well conceived how man ſhould ever be the ſubject of pain or ſorrow, did not ſin render him paſſible, and open a way for the Sword to enter his bowels, and give it that edge and force which cauſeth it to pierce the deeper, and to wound more ſenſibly. Now as a diſtemper which ariſeth from a Surfet, is to be look't at only as an effect of Intemperance, and is not to be quarrell'd at, but the cauſe of it to be blam'd; and as the Chyrurgions ſearching into the feſtered place is not a wound, but a diſcovery of the depth of the ſore, in order to its cure; ſo are the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which God ſends on a People only to be regarded as the Symptomes of, and means to cure that diſorder, and diſtemperedneſs within our ſelves, which doth as it were naturally produce ſuch ſufferings. It is not the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of ſome inward diſtemper, which is our ſickneſſe it ſelf, but 'tis
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54206:5"/>
rather the effect of it. The ſpots diſcernable upon the infected, are not the <hi>Plague,</hi> but the Tokens. Thus are we to account the moſt grievous things that light upon us, but as the manifeſtations and fruits of ſomething worſe within us. Now look when men by outward ſignes find out thoſe ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours that lodge within them, they labour not ſo much to repreſſe the out-ſide ſore, as to correct and remove the inward cauſe. He that when the Pox comes out upon a child, would drive them in, ſhall but make ſure and haſten his death; but rather will the wiſe Phyſitian preſcribe means for their kindly coming forth and ripening, that by them the corrupt humours may be vented and vaniſh. He that is troubled with heats and fluſhings, ariſing from his Liver, would but play the fool to lay plaiſters to himſelf, but will rather take Phyſick that may inwardly purge him. Even thus alſo ſuffering having its birth and nouriſhment from ſin, the way for the redreſs of that is the removal of this. And by no other means can a kindly cure be effected. Indeed ſometimes an affliction may be taken off in greater wrath, than it was laid on, when people ſo revolt, that God will ſtrike them no more, but becauſe they are joyned to their Idols, will let them alone; but this is but the making way for ſorer judgments to follow. And thus will it be whereſoever we are taken from under the Rod, before we are brought under the yoke. If outward ſufferings turn to hardneſſe of heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate is the caſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of ſuch a people or perſon, however they may applaud them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their deliverance; this is but like a venome which may ſeem to leave a finger or hand, but ſtrikes up to the heart: this is but a skinning over the ſore which will wrankle beyond the poſſi billty of a cure; It is but a kind of lightning before death, the ſureſt forerunner and ſaddeſt preſage, that all our happineſs is giving up the ghoſt and departing from us. Now we muſt needs acknowledge it infinite mercy and goodneſſe in our God, when we have reduc't our ſelves to ſuch a dangerous eſtate by ſin, any way to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it to us, though by ſharp and ſmarting means, ſo that theſe prevent our final ruine. Oh that I could inculcate this into my own, and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſoul, that before we felt any pain, we lodg'd within us a greater evil, and that what we now feel proceeds from the hand of love, if we are wiſe to improve it. Poor man, thou crieſt out of poverty, loſſe of Relations, ſickneſſe and pain, but didſt thou not know it? Thou carriedſt theſe, yea, and worſe than all theſe about thee before, when yet thou could'ſt go up and down quietly enough and never complain. Couldſt thou not ſwear, be drunk, commit lewdneſſe, over-reach, defraud, and oppreſs thy brother, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane the Lords day, neglect the worſhip of God both in publick and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, make a jeſt of Scripture, and mock at holineſſe, and corn, and deride, hate, and perſecute the moſt ſerious Chriſtians? Theſe, theſe, oh ſenſleſſe ſinner, were thy ſickneſſe and miſery; theſe conceived and bore about in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54206:5"/>
their bowels, all that ſorrow which ſince they have brought forth. Sin goes big with all the moſt dreadful Evils in the world; even Hell it ſelf is its natural off-ſpring. But alas thou feltſt no hurt, no ſmart in all this. Thou couldſt grieve the Spirit of God, and trample under foot thy Redeemers Blood, and run freſh Spears into his ſide, and nails into his hands and feet, and yet never once in any ſober ſadneſſe reflect upon thy ſelf, and ſay, What have I done? Thy ſin was thy pleaſure, thy ſport, thy trade; ſo ſweet, ſo profitable, that thou thoughteſt it as dear to thee, as thy life it ſelf; and couldſt never believe thou wa'st doing thy ſelf ſo much miſchief, while thou was't pleaſing thy fleſh, or filling thy purſe. How hard a task had he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook, that would have gone about then to have convinc't thee that thy moſt delightful gainful ſins, were indeed thy wounds, thy loſſes, and would be thy undoing? And yet thus it was. He that is ſwallowing down poiſon becauſe its ſweet, or wrapt up in gilded pills, is then poiſoning himſelf even whilſt the ſweetneſſe is in his mouth, and his palate is pleaſed with the reliſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though perhaps he may then laugh at him, that cries out it is poiſon, and bids him therefore as he loves his life, ſpit it out: What, ſhall you perſwade him that can be hurtful, whoſe taſte is ſo pleaſant? But even he himſelf when he feels it burn his heart, and gripe his bowels, and torture his inward parts, will then cry out he is poiſoned, and roar out in the anguiſh and bitter tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which he feels, but all this his pain is but the working of that poiſon, which then became mortal, whilſt it went down ſo pleaſantly. You may hear people when in ſufferings, make ſad complaints and lamentations, that would even melt ones heart to hear them: Then they can cry out, oh my my wife, or husband, or child is dead! What ſhall I do? How can I bear it? Oh what courſe ſhall I take to get bread, for my ſelf and Family? cry the poor; what muſt we ſtarve for want of relief? Oh how doleful is our caſe! And they that are under ſickneſſe, and ſtrook with the viſible hand of God, how do their hearts ſink within them like a ſtone? How pale and ghaſtly do their looks of a ſudden become? Now they are even at their wits end, oh any thing, any thing for help? What piteous moans now they can make! oh their head, their heart, their back! Now with what aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and horrors, do they every moment expect to breath out their laſt? with what amazing fears, what dark and diſmal apprehenſions of the ſtate they are entering upon, are they now ſeiz'd? what paſſionate out-cries may you hear from them? what muſt they dye? Is there no remedy? no hope? Muſt they then leave the world they have lov'd ſo much, and liv'd in ſo long? And bid farewel to their freinds and companions, their houſes, and lands, their ſports and merriments and gainful trading, and all for ever! Oh that ever they ſhould be born to ſee ſuch a day! That their dwellings ſhould be within the reach of the Contagion! That this dreadful death of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54206:6"/>
ſhould befall them! That they ſhould be left thus deſolate and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn, forſaken of all, abandoned of their neareſt relations, in this time of their greateſt extremity, when they moſt need ſuccour and comfort! Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands ſuch hearty groanings, and bitter wailings may you hear: but had you come in amongſt theſe people, a few days ſince, oh what quite other kind of men were they? How jolly and ſecure, following their pleaſures or buſineſſe; and would it's like have laught at him that ſhould have told them of a death ſo near, or of the Judgment that follows after. How few, alas! how very few ſhould you have then found amongſt them, who did at any time cry out, oh blind mind that is ſo ignorant of God! Oh earnal heart that is ſo averſe from his Laws! Oh how unevenly do I walk! Baſe trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous wretch that I am, thus to depart from God! Vile and unthankful creature, that ever I ſhould offend a God of ſuch mercy and love! Oh that I was delivered from the power of my luſts, the temptations of Satan, and all the diſeaſes of my ſoul! Alas! inſtead of ſuch becoming language as this, you might from the moſt have heard, ſwearing and curſing, idle ſongs, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and ribbald ſpeeches, or at the beſt, frothy, fooliſh, or worldly unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table diſcourſe. Poor ſtupid ſinner, then thou waſt ſtabbing and deſtroying thy ſelf, then thou waſt ſeiz'd with the moſt deadly Infection. Then had it been no uncharitableneſſe, nor abſurdity to have ſet a Lord have Mercy upon me, in Capital Letters on thy forehead; yea, wiſe and holy men ſaw it there in that wickedneſs that broke out in thy life, and lookt on thee as fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for a Peſthouſe, than converſe; as one not to be accompanied with, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in order to thy Recovery. Now muſt we not all in general ſay, that it is tender compaſſion in the great Benefactour to mankind, that he will ſo farre concern himſelf with us in our miſerable eſtate, as by any means to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken us to a ſenſe of it, whilſt there is any poſſibility of a Cure: Sottiſh wretches, that meaſure all events by their correſpondency to fleſh and blood, will not believe there can be love in ſuch ſore Afflictions. They to whom Sin was ſweet, will hardly be brought to like well of thoſe potions, which are adminiſtred on purpoſe to make it bitter. How will they loath the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, who love their very Sickneſſe? But all whoſe eyes God ſhall open by his Providences, will ſee abundant cauſe to bleſſe, and praiſe him for his Love, in working them to a timely apprehenſion of that, which otherwiſe had been their ruine. Tell me man, Is it not a wonderful mercy to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened on this ſide Hell, let the means be what they will? If thy preſent ſmart makes thee judge otherwiſe, couldſt thou but come to the ſpeech of thoſe undone ſouls whoſe hopes are periſht for ever, they would ſoon ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie thee that every thing is tenderneſſe, and very great mercy that comes to diſcover Sin, and prevent everlaſting miſery. Oh lay this to heart in time man, and ſtay not too long, till feeling give thee a too clear and undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54206:6"/>
demonſtration of this Truth. If now thou crieſt out thou art undone, becauſe thy Trading's gone, thy Friends dead, or thy Self in danger of Death, and lookſt not about thee to find out, and be affected with greater Evils than all theſe, and ſo to eſcape much greater Sufferings than yet thou haſt felt, 'tis but a little while before thou<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ſhalt find Arguments reaching to thy very ſoul, which will make thee acknowledge what I now ſay. Oh then, when thou findeſt thy ſelf under the vials of divine vengeance, and haſt taken up thy reſidence amongſt the Devils and damned Ghoſts in the midſt of the burning Lake, what ſlight inconſiderable things not worth the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning will all the miſeries thou underwentſt in thy life-time appear to thee? What deſirable things will the moſt pinching Poverty, the moſt grievous Pain then ſeem, compar'd to what thou wilt endure? What very trifles, meer flea-bitings wilt thou then judge Famines, Plagues, and heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Judgments that can light upon men whilſt in the body? Oh what wouldſt thou then give to be where thou waſt, when thou thoughteſt thy ſelf at the worſt? And wouldſt thou entertain ſuch a ſtate with joy and thankfulneſs, which before thou thoughteſt the moſt miſerable that a man could poſſibly be caſt into? Then thou wilt confeſs, that to be Shut up from the Society of Men, hath nothing of dolefulneſs in it, compar'd to thy being Shut up under the burning wrath of an unreconciled God. Then at length, whether thou wilt or no, thou ſhalt ſee ſin, and cry out of ſin, and acknowledge 'tis thy ſin that hath ruin'd thee. Now thou canſt in thy cold, faint manner by rote, ſay thou art a great Sinner, and perhaps maiſt curſorily cry God mercy; but then from the very inwards of thy ſoul ſhalt thou repent of ſin, with ſuch a kind of helliſh repentance, as is proper to thoſe damned Spirits in the midſt of their Tortures; Such an one as thy Predeceſſour <hi>Judas</hi> felt the beginnings of, when he ran to the halter for comfort. Then thou ſhalt not only with thoſe <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 11. pour out thy blaſphemies againſt God, the breath of whoſe fury like a ſtream of brimſtone kindles and keeps alive thoſe unquenchable flames: but thou ſhalt alſo load thy ſelf with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier accuſations, than ever any of Gods Miniſters did whilſt thou waſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>earth. Then thou ſhalt feelingly confeſs thy ſelf ſtark mad and beſotted, and wonder at thy own ſtupendious folly, that ever thou ſhouldſt ſo wilfully and reſolutely plunge thy ſelf into that place of woe. And this will be none of the leaſt aggravations of thy torment, to reflect upon thoſe many ways which God us'd with thee to have convinc't thee of thy ſin and danger be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it had been too late, of all which thou mad'ſt light, and wouldſt not be taught by them; when the hand of God here was lifted up, thou wouldſt not ſee; but then thou ſhalt ſee, thou ſhalt know. Then thou wilt eaſily grant, that the ſharpeſt ſuffering that had ſo ſhewn thee ſin, as to have ſav'd thee from this wrath, had been the happieſt providence that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54206:7"/>
ever befell thee. Would any man that hath not loſt his wits, as well as his gratitude, take it ill from his neighbour that ſhould waken him out of his ſweet ſleep, when the houſe is on fire over his ears, yea, though he pinch and beat him black and blue that he may ſpeedily rouze him? Now from all I have ſaid then, I would gather, That the heavy hand of God upon a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as it is laid on for ſin, ſo for the moſt part not meerly for puniſhment and deſtruction, but to diſcover to us the evil of our doings, that they may be repented of, and put away. And ſo there is much mercy in the midſt of theſe Judgments, if they be improv'd to thoſe eads to which their nature is fitted for, and which we are commanded to make of them. The greateſt of theſe Calamities to thoſe that remain, are but like the ſounding of a Trumpet, the giving an Alarm, the ſhooting off a Warning-piece, the hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of a white Flag, and all ſpeak to this purpoſe, That though the Sins of a Nation have been exceeding great and provoking, whereby the Anger of the moſt holy God is juſtly kindled againſt them, which he ſends theſe his Judgments to teſtifie, that yet he is willing to put up all former affronts that have been offered, if now at length they will become a refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med People, and with deteſtation of their ſins turn from them unto God and his holy Ways; but if not, that his anger ſhall not be turned away, but his hand ſtretched out ſtill, till he hath made a full end of them, and will follow them with judgment after judgment, till they are caſt into the loweſt hell. So that you ſee plainly the Rod, hath a voice, and is a kind of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, but comes nearer to the ſenſe, and will force an obſervance more than meer words could do. We could chuſe whether we would read a Bible or good Book, or regard a Miniſter or godly Neighbour, giving us this very Leſſon as plainly, but in a more gentle manner. We could ſtop our ears, or turn our backs, or harden our hearts againſt all the moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakening, ſtartling Truths: We could make a piſh of the moſt dreadful threatnings in the Book of God, denounc't againſt thoſe very ſins we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; we could laugh at our Teachers and Reprovers, and ſcorn at the offers of their love for our recovery. And when we were ſunk into ſuch a deplorable eſtate, wanting nothing of falling head-long into Hell, but the withdrawing of that miraculous patience which kept us out every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then in infinite mercy did our God, who like a wiſe Phyſitian, ſuits his potions to the nature of the diſeaſe, and temper of his Patients, make bare his Arm, and reveal himſelf and his pleaſure to us, in a way moſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to affect us, if we who yet ſurvive, be not obſtinately bent upon our own deſtruction. Let us not then murmur or repine: for if our diſeaſe be grown to ſuch an height, that without ſtronger medicines it would be our death, Is it not all the reaſon in the world that we ſhould ſubmit to thoſe preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions which are proportion'd to it? Whoever thou art that ſuffereſt, thou
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54206:7"/>
haſt reaſon to be content, for its thy own doing; thou mightſt have hearkned in time to the plain Word of God, and ſo have eſcap't this ſeverer diſcipline. Thou who waſt wilfully deaf to the ſtill voice, Is it not of thy ſelf that a Meſſage is delivered to thee in ſuch terrible thundrings? If thou hadſt not clos'd thy eyes againſt the gentle light, they had never been ſo forcibly held open by the hand of God, to ſee thoſe things which are as clear as the Noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days Sun<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If the Word of God had ſunk into thy ſoul, thou hadſt not thus felt his arrows in thy fleſh, nor been taught thus with briars and thorns, like them, <hi>Judg.</hi> 8. 16. God delights not in the ſmarting and roaring of his creatures; but yet he that hath bidden Parents by the rod of correction to drive out the folly that is bound up in the heart of a Child, ſo he loves the ſons of men, that he will not ſpare his rod when it may (and if it be not mens own fault, will) conduce to their advantage. When there is no way but either the gangren'd member, or the life muſt go, who would not loſe that, to ſave this? Still then here is mercy: Afflictions, beſide the frightful noiſe, have a clear ſenſe and meaning; beſide the heat that ſcorcheth, they have an informing light. God might in a moment have ſnatch't thee from Earth to Hell, and there have convinc't thee in ſuch a manner as leaves no room for thy Reformation, when as now he hath taken away thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and but threatned thee with death, and afforded thee ſome breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-time for thy preparation, and for the prevention of the endleſs death. Thou who art reading theſe lines, mighteſt have been the firſt at whom God had level<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d his arrows; thou mighteſt have been ſnatch't out of the World ſuddenly, without any other warning than the Word had given thee, as it may have hapned to others. But ſince it hath not thus befaln thee, whatever thou maiſt feel or fear further, thou canſt not but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge God treats thee very graciouſly. Whilſt thou art on this ſide Hell, thou maiſt learn much by the ſevereſt Diſpenſations; and though this ſeem a cutting, piercing way of teaching, yet is it (as I ſaid before) beſt ſuited to thy dulneſs and ſenſleſsneſs, and moſt likely to prevail with thee, as not needing ſo much the pains of a particular Application to thy ſelf, which thou wouldſt not be brought to in the hearing of the moſt ſearching Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. 'Twas but forgetting them, and there was an end of all; but now God ſpeaks words which may be felt, that ſhall ſtick longer by thee, and upon which he will keep thy moſt ſerious thoughts whether thou wilt or no. It did require indeed deep and frequent conſideration to convince thy ſelf of thy loſt undone eſtate by reaſon of ſin, whilſt thou waſt ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in plenty and proſperity, and couldſt bid thy ſoul take its eaſe: Alas! what was it to hear of the wrath of God, a never-dying worm, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable fire, whilſt men felt all well with themſelves; and lookt upon thoſe very ſins as eſſential to their happineſs, which the Word repreſented
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54206:8"/>
as their miſery? They were not then likely to think very ill of them whilſt they perceiv'd no hurt they did them; but now when God ſhall manifeſt his hatred (and conſequently the evil) of ſin by demonſtrations reaching to the very bone, he that groans under theſe loads, may very readily infer, that ſurely ſin is an exceeding great evil, which pulls down ſuch Judgments from a compaſſionate God: which yet at the higheſt, are but forerunners of infinitely worſe to follow, even everlaſting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord without timely Repentance. And when thou haſt ſo far made advantage of thy afflictions, as thence to inform thy ſelf of the evil of ſin in general, and of thy particular ſin; to know that ſin is a Plague, and to know what is the Plague of thy own heart, then thou art in a very fair way towards deliverance and healing. And this is made evident to us by the words of <hi>Solomon</hi> which we propounded at the beginning, which I intend not particularly to inſiſt on, but to make them the foundation of a more general and laxe Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>The Import of them ſeems to be this, That any man under any Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity whatever, that ſhould be ſenſible of the Sin that procured it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take himſelf to God, by Prayer and true Repentance, for him the wiſe man Prays, that he may have audience and Mercy. For ſuch a man is fit to have the plaiſter taken off his ſore, on whom it hath had a kindly influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, anſwerable to the end whereunto God ſent it; namely, to ſhew his Sin, humble him for, and turn him from it.</p>
            <p>Two things on the By only, I ſhall hint from theſe words,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That we may very well turn this Prayer of <hi>Solomon's</hi> into a Promiſe, and conclude that what he beg'd of God, and that with a particular Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſhall be granted to every man, in any place performing the Conditions here deſcribed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Note, that under the work <hi>Know,</hi> is compriz'd the whole performance of all that is required in other places of Scripture, in order to the obtaining of the pardon of Sin, and the removal of thoſe Judgments which it had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured. There is nothing more common in holy Writ, than the making words of Knowledge, incluſive of the affections and practice alſo. To know God, frequently comprehends our whole duty to him; for our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him being the beginning and ground-work of all other Duties, and producing them where it is in clearneſſe and power, may very well be put for all. According to this is our Engliſh Phraſe, I'le make you know your Superiours, that is, perform your duty to them. So here to know the <hi>Plague</hi> of our own heart (by which is meant Sin, the diſeaſe of the Soul) is as much as to be convinc't of it, to ſee its Odiouſneſſe, to be lively humbled for, and ſincerely reſolved to forſake it. That it muſt be a working practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Knowledge, not reſting in meer conviction, is evident from the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54206:8"/>
words, which mention the Prayer proceeding from thoſe <hi>who know the Plague of their own Hearts;</hi> the ſame alſo follows, <hi>and spread forth their hands to this Houſe;</hi> that is, make their addreſſes to God, with ſome kind of particular Reference to the Temple, where he did in a more ſpecial manner reſide and manifeſt himſelf; and thus <hi>Daniel</hi> in captivity opened his window toward <hi>Jeruſalem, Dan.</hi> 6. 10. Now he that ſhould thus come to God; what is it for? Not only for deliverance, but alſo to confeſſe ſin, the cauſe of his miſery; and if ſo, then muſt he be truly grieved for his provocations of the moſt holy God, and this could not be without promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and purpoſes of a Reformation.</p>
            <p>Now I need not ſtand to prove what I before mentioned, that whoever is thus affected ſhall, if not be freed from the temporal Affliction he lies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, yet, be ſecured from the hurt of it, and have greater bleſſings beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; this, I ſay, I need not ſtand to prove, the Scripture being everywhere ſo full of Examples and Promiſes that demonſtrate it. And indeed it is fully evidenc't in the very tenour of the Covenant of Grace, which aſſures Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and Salvation, and all things truly good for us, upon the Condition of our coming to, and receiving Chriſt; which none can do, but they who are ſenſible of their need of him, who have ſeen the evil of ſin, both as to its nature and effects, and are deſirous to be delivered from the guilt, and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; and this ſenſe of ſin, and averſion from it in heart and life, is true Repentance, and upon condition of this it was that <hi>Soloman</hi> pray'd for, and God frequehtly Promiſeth Mercy, and particularly ſee his anſwer to this very Prayer, and the Promiſe he made to grant it, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7. 13, 14.</p>
            <p>Wherever then the Judgments of God, are more Eminently Inflicted on a People, it is a ſign there are ſome hainous tranſgreſſions which have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved them. If the Plague, or any ſuch Calamity, ſeize a Nation, it ſpeaks this much, that there is a Plague in the hearts of that People; ſome ſuch wickedneſſe which provok'd God, to pour out his Wrath upon them. Sin is as the body, ſuffering uſually as the ſhadow that attends it; the one is as fire, the other as ſmoak that proceeds from it. Wherefore by the putting away of ſin only, can we eſcape the threatned wrath, or reſcue our ſelves out of that we feel. This is very plain, if the knowledge and removal of the Plague of our hearts, conduce to our Recovery, then our being ſeiz'd with it was our miſery: and therefore the Cauſe being removed, the Effect will follow. If the entertainment of <hi>Sheba</hi> into <hi>Abel,</hi> bring <hi>Joab</hi> and an Army againſt it, then to deliver him to them is the only way to procure their departure, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſeveral Truths then are plain, and the words we have taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of naturally afford them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That God is the Supream efficient cauſe of all the Sufferings we lie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54206:9"/>
               <hi>Is there Evil in a City,</hi> (of Affliction that is) <hi>and hath not he done it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It is for the Sin of a People, that God lays theſe ſufferings upon them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is a moſt proper ſeaſonable Duty, in times of ſuch Calamity, to make enquiry into our wayes, that we may diſcover what is moſt likely to be the Cauſe; What is that <hi>Achan</hi> that trouble us? This is the great thing whereof we are call'd in the day of adverſity to conſider; and accordingly, the moſt of my buſineſs in my following Diſcourſe, ſhall be the practice of this Direction: for I ſhall not particularly handle any of theſe Obſervations.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If we finding out ourſin, bewail and abhor it, put it far from us, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take our ſelves to God for mercy and pardon, <hi>then will he hear in heaven, and forgive;</hi> remove from us our Miſeries, and reſtore his Loving-kindneſs.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only anſwer one Objection by the way, and ſo paſs on to what I chiefly deſign. Some may ſay, they have been ſenſible of, and in ſome meaſure humbled for ſin, and yet notwithſtanding, have been held under as ſharp and as long ſufferings as others. Here we muſt diſtinguiſh (1) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt National and Perſonal Judgments: (2) betwixt the Ends and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why they are inflicted: (3) betwixt the Croſs and the Curſe of it. And ſo I anſwer.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) If the Judgment be National, as Sword, Famine, Captivity, ſome great Mortality, and this ſent for a National common Sin, it cannot here be expected, that the Humiliation of ſome few particular Perſons ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſerve for the averting ſuch Calamities. Nay, the Righteous them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves may be involved in them; as we find there were many good Men carried captive with the reſt into <hi>Babylon,</hi> amongſt which, were <hi>Daniel,</hi> and the three Children. Indeed ſometimes we read of one or more ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the gap, and preventing a deluge of wrath, as <hi>Moſes</hi> oft did, but there was then alſo ſome kind of general Humiliation; for of the people, its ſaid, <hi>When God ſlew, then they ſought him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Pſal. 78. 34. And though <hi>Moſes</hi> prevailed thus far, that they might not utterly be deſtroyed, yet ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſore Judgments were frequently laid upon them. <hi>Noah</hi> deliver'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and Family only, not the old World. <hi>Lot</hi> himſelf and Children, but not <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah;</hi> though then God graciouſly condeſcended to have ſpared them all for the ſake of Ten righteous Perſons, could they have been found amongſt them. But at another time, ſo great and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral were the Sins of the <hi>Jews,</hi> That God tells this Prophet, Though <hi>Noah, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> were there, they ſhould only deliver their own ſouls, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14. 14. Ordinarily, 'tis an Humiliation in ſome competent meaſure proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd to the ſin which muſt appeaſe the wrath of God broke out upon a people. When all <hi>Nineveh</hi> had ſinned, and was threatned, it muſt be a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Repentance that could prevent the Execution of thoſe Threatnings.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Though particular Perſons may not by their Reformation procure
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54206:9"/>
mercy to a whole Land, nor yet free themſelves from the outward ſtroak which lights upon the Body of the Nation, yet ſhall not their labour be loſt, but God will have a ſpecial eye to them in the common Ruin; and what is in wrath to others, ſhall be in love to them. They ſhall have ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch preſervation from, or deliverance out of the temporal Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; or ſuch ſupport in, and advantage by it, that they ſhall have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant reaſon to acknowledge, that their Repentance and Supplications were not in vain. Fear not, poor Chriſtian, if thou be but a mourner in <hi>Zion,</hi> one whoſe heart bleeds for thine own and others tranſgreſſions; though thy Dwelling be in the midſt of profane, rebellious Sinners, yet thou ſhalt not be loſt in a croud. It is not the Oaths, and Blaſphemies, and Crying Sins of thoſe about thee, that ſhall drown thy Prayers: but God will hear, and one way or other graciouſly anſwer them. If thy Soul, thy everlaſting Life be given thee for a prey (as a temporal Life was promiſed to <hi>Ebed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech,</hi> Jer. 39. 19. and to <hi>Baruch,</hi> Jer. 45. 5) thou haſt ſure no reaſon to complain. What though the ſame Diſeaſe, and Death ſeize thee, as doth them? It comes not for the ſame Reaſon, nor ſhall it have the ſame effect. What though thou waſt carried in the ſame Ship with Traitors into another Countrey, where they are to be executed, and thou advanc'd to the higheſt Dignity, was this any hurt to thee? If Death take thee from the preſſures of all ſorts, under which thou maiſt now groan, and from the Evil to come, and tranſlate thee into the glorious Preſence and full Fruition of the Ever-bleſſed God, this is ſure a different thing from being ſnatch't away from thy happineſs into the ſociety and torments of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and his Angels. Wherefore thou haſt good reaſon to acknowledge Gods diſtinguiſhing mercy in thoſe his dealings with thee, which to ſenſe may be the ſame with what others meet with. I might add alſo the ſpiritual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages which accrue to the Godly by Afflictions ſanctified, but the other contains this in it, and much more.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) Thy Afflictions may perhaps be more for Trial, than Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and ſo may be continued, notwiſtanding thy endeavour to find out and forſake ſin; but when they have wrought that particular End for which God ſent them, they ſhall be removed. Or they may befall thee for the Cauſe of God, and a Teſtimony of a good Conſcience, and then thou haſt more cauſe to rejoyce in them, than impatiently to ſeek their removal. Whatever they be, ſee thou make this uſe of them, to be more deeply humbled for, and ſet againſt ſin, which is remotely at leaſt, the cauſe of all Suffering; and to demean thy ſelf patiently and ſubmiſſively under the mighty hand of God, and in his due time he will exalt thee.</p>
            <p>It being then evident, That the knowledge of Sin is ſo neceſſary to the removing the heavy hand of an offended God from off an afflicted Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54206:10"/>
Surely, the great Work we are all call'd to in this day of our ſore Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, is to give all diligence to know why it is that God contendeth with us; and wherein we have incenſt him thus, to pour out his wrath upon us; that ſo we turning from our particular ſins, he may turn away his anger, and comfort us. And in order to this, it is the duty of every one, who is an Inhabitant of the Land, in the firſt place to call himſelf to a ſtrict account, and impartially to look into his heart, and review his life, and ſee what he hath done towards the haſtening theſe Judgments upon us, and accordingly apply himſelf to God, to do his utmoſt for their removal. Every man hath brought a faggot to the kindling of the Common flame, wherefore every man ſhould bring his bucket to quench it. And here let me warn every ſoul to beware of a moſt dangerous temptation, wherewith its like they'l be aſſaulted, to wit, to think but very meanly, and ſleightly of their own particular ſins, as if they had little or no influence, to the bringing on us ſuch grievous Calamities; and that partly out of ſelf-love, which makes us very tender how we accuſe our ſelves, and ready to extenuate all our own faults; partly, becauſe we may yet be free from the ſmart, and therefore take but a cold ſuperficial view of our ſelves; and partly, becauſe when we look upon the evils in groſſe under which the Nation lies, we can diſcern no proportion betwixt them, and our perſonal offences, and this comes much from our ignorance of the hainous nature of the leaſt ſin. Now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on thy ſelf, Reader, and tell me, Haſt thou not been very ready in the general to cry out, That 'tis for the ſins of the Nation we are now afflicted; and to flie out very bitterly againſt this party, or that; this abuſe, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther corruption in Church or State, but in the mean time, haſt been very backward, to charge and accuſe thy ſelf, as thou oughteſt, as if thou waſt not a member of this ſinful and ſuffering Nation. Let thy Conſcience an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer whether this hath not been thy way, and judge whether this be a juſt performance of thy duty. If every perſon thus ſhift it from himſelf, where will Repentance be found, and what's like to become of us? If there were an Army to go forth againſt the Enemy, and one perſon ſhould draw back, and ſay, what can he do? He cannot be miſt in ſuch a Multitude, nor can he do much againſt ſuch a numerous force, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſires he may ſtay at home; and another come, and uſe the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, and ſo a third; and at length all that have the ſame reaſon, (which indeed every man may pretend to) what's like to become of the War? And yet alas! how doth this ſenſeleſſe Objection, generally prevail in the World, in a caſe ſomewhat different from this, <hi>viz:</hi> hindring that coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Zeal, and Induſtry, for the promoting of Religion, and for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Devils Kingdom, which beſeems every Member of Chriſt hat is liſted into his ſervice, by the Baptiſmal Covenant, wherein he was
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54206:10"/>
engaged to fight under the Banner of Chriſt, and that without putting in this Condition, that he ſhould have good ſtore of Company to joyn with, and back him: for without this he may come off a Conquerour. But yet now cries one, What can I do againſt an overflowing torrent of wickedneſs? what can I, a weak, and ſingle perſon do, for the advancement of Holineſs, againſt a wicked raging multitude? what canſt thou do? why, thou canſt ſtrive and dye, canſt not? But what then, ſhall no-body do any thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe every man is but one, and hath many difficulties to encounter? Or wilt thou therefore do nothing, becauſe thou canſt not expect a ſucceſſe anſwerable to thy deſires? Or may we not joyn, and unite our ſtrength, and all ſet to a ſhoulder, for the carrying on of the work of the Lord? Be ſure thou ſhalt always have difficulties to try thee: for 'tis thy heart God calls for, he needs not thy hands. Why, Man, if thou waſt alone in all the World, having ſuch a Leader and Captain as Chriſt, wouldſt thou not ſtick to his Cauſe, and keep to his Colours, and die fighting? If not, thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveſt not the name of a Chriſtian. And if there be ſo few who ſeek the things of Chriſt, with how much more vigour and reſolution ought thoſe few to beſtir themſelves; and not alſo forſake their Lord, becauſe the reſt of the world do? but ſtill they ſhould imagine they hear the awakening words of Chriſt to his Diſciples, ſounding in their ears, What, will ye for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake me alſo? But this was a digreſſion.</p>
            <p>Let not then, I ſay, the conſideration of thy being a ſingle perſon, abate any thing of the meaſures of thy Sorrow for Sin: for if all do thus, as all may have the ſame ground, there will be none found to charge ſin on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and acknowledge Gods Juſtice in all his ſharp diſpenſations.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, whoever thou art, into whoſe hands theſe lines may fall, my earneſt requeſt to thee, yea, my ſtrict Injunction, is this, that thou preſently get alone, and ſoberly ſit down to the intent ſtudy of thy ſelf: Beg of God, to help thee in this work, and do thou endeavour with all faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as in his ſight, who will ſhortly Judge thee before all the world, to rip open to thy ſelf all the baſeneſs that hath been lodg'd in thy heart, all the luſts that have been entertained there. And Conſider well thy Life, what known Sins thou haſt been guilty of, what Duties thou haſt omitted. And then with all ſpeed and ſeriouſneſſe, betake thy ſelf to God, acknowledg thy own vileneſs, plainly confeſs, that 'tis this or that thy ſin, thy looſneſs, thy covetouſneſs, thy pride, idleneſſe, or voluptuouſneſſe, that may have helpt forward his anger. And own it as a token of undeſerved Grace, that all manner of woes have not ſeiz'd upon thee, in thy own perſon; that whilſt ſo many are Afflicted, and taken out of the world before thee, thou haſt warning and leave to prepare, for what may befall thee. And ſee that thou labour to repreſent ſin to thy ſelf, with all its heightning circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54206:11"/>
and aggravations, that the review of it may more deeply affect thee; help thy Meditations with thoſe doleful miſeries ſo many now lie under, and that in part for thy ſins, which yet are but the beginning of woes to the impenitent; and then think, if theſe are no jeſting matters, what is the ſin that procur'd them: Think of that matchleſs Love, that continued Patience, that clear Light, thoſe great Engagements, Purpoſes, and frequent Promiſes, that thou haſt ſinned againſt; till at length, theſe Conſiderations work thee to ſuch an apprehenſion of ſin, that thou canſt not conceive of any ſuffering ſuited to its demerit, but the everlaſting wrath of the moſt dreadful Majeſty: and till thou acknowledge not only thy contributing to the preſent calamity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that if the reſt of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had been like thee, it would ſurely have been all in flames before now.</p>
            <p>Be ſincere and thorow in this humiliation of ſoul, and take heed of neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting any ſuch Conſideration as may help on the ſame. Review thy Self, thy Place, and Relations, and what in them was expected from thee, which thou failedſt in performing, and accordingly lay it to heart, and judge and condemn thy ſelf and behaviour. If in any place of Honour and Service, thou haſt not improved thy intereſt for the rooting out of Sin, and advancement of Holineſs, account thy negligence aggravated by the greatneſs of the Talents thou waſt entruſted with. Waſt thou a man of Wealth, Wit, Power; a Magiſtrate, a Miniſter, a Maſter of a Family? Take a ſtrict account of, and humbly bewail thy unfaithfulneſs to thy ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Truſts, and thy careleſneſs of thoſe duties which thy place did peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly engage thee to.</p>
            <p>And do not think when thou haſt diſcovered, and confeſs'd ſin, that then thy work is over, as if<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by thy formalities thou hadſt purchaſed to thy ſelf a diſpenſation to continue in it; like many, that think they ſerve God ſufficiently by going to Church, and ſaying their Prayers, and in the mean while make this their ſerving him, but a kind of indulgence for their ſinning againſt him.</p>
            <p>But when thou haſt made this progreſs, thy next work in order to the obtaining of a Pardon, is, ſeriouſly and deliberately to reſolve upon the putting away far from thee every known ſin, upon mortifying thy deareſt luſts, and upon a faithful performance of thoſe duties common to all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and thoſe thy Talents or Relations call for. If thou haſt been a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch't, or covetous Perſon; a careleſs Miſpender of thy money or time; an Extortioner, or Oppreſſour; a racking Landlord, or cheating Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; a Sabbath-breaker, and Neglecter of Duty to God, publick or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate; or haſt liv'd in any the like ſins, enter now into a ſolemn Covenant with God, that by the aſſiſtance of his Almighty Grace, thou wilt never more allow thy ſelf in ſuch a courſe of Impiety. If thou haſt abuſed thy
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54206:11"/>
Riches, and laid them out only in making proviſions for thy own or others luſts; If thou thoughteſt thy Dignity above others, did diſpenſe thee a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of ſinning without controll, and accordingly haſt miſimprov'd it; If thou haſt been unfaithful in the execution of Juſtice, with which thou waſt entruſted, neither looking after ſin to puniſh it, nor puniſhing it when it was revealed to thee, but haſt rather been a Terrour to good works, than to evil; If as a Miniſter, thou haſt been regardleſs of the ſouls of thoſe committed to thy overſight, only ſtriving to enrich thy ſelf, not better thy people, practiſing thoſe ſins thou haſt preach'd againſt; Or, if as Ruler of a Family, thou haſt been negligent, not ſetting up the Worſhip of God in thy Houſe, but gone from one day to another without ſo much as a ſerious Prayer, nor haſt inſtructed thy Children, nor Servants in the fear of the Lord; whatever, in a word, thy truſt and unfaithfulneſs to it hath been, confeſs and lament the ſame, and reſolve for the future to do thy ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to diſcharge thy duty, to anſwer and fill up thy ſeveral Relations.</p>
            <p>And here again, let not any inſiſt on that ſilly Objection before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd; What can my repentance do to the diverting of Judgments that flow in upon us like a deluge! For if all, I ſay, uſe this, who is it muſt pacifie Gods wrath by their Reformation? But, if thou for thy part wilt practiſe what I have here curſorily directed, thou knoweſt not but others may do ſo alſo; and ſo, if every one would ſet to this Work, thy Cavil would be wholly ſilenc'd and anſwer'd. But again, thou wouldeſt grant it to ſome purpoſe for the whole body of the people to joyn in hearty humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and amendment of their wayes, and know, that as to the greateſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit that would accrue to a Nation by ſuch a general repentance, thou ſhalt procure it to thy ſelf by this perſonal performance of thy Duty; that is, either the Affliction it ſelf ſhall be kept, or taken off thee, or laid on in ſo much mercy, that thou thy ſelf ſhalt, either here, or in another World, bleſs God for the the ſame. And I hope this advantage is not inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, when on the other hand thou remembreſt, how certainly thy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitence will cauſe thy everlaſting, as well as temporal ruine. And take notice from the Text, That God will render to every particular man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his wayes; but this I have before ſaid ſomething to.</p>
            <p>Oh that now there were in us all ſuch reſolutions unfeignedly to ſearch our hearts, and reform our lives, and with our whole ſouls turn to the Lord our God, from whom we have revolted! What bleſſed Effects ſhould we find of this wiſe and dutiful demeanour! Oh that I knew how to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade poor ſouls to this courſe, before their deadly enemy, who now doth all he can to harden and ſtupifie them, ſhall be fully ſeiz'd of them, paſt all poſſibility of a delivery; then ſcorning at all our endeavours, and challenging us to do our beſt for the reſcue of ſuch undone ſouls, who
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54206:12"/>
muſt be tormented by him, by whom they would be ruled. But if thou art ſo far perſwaded of the reaſonableneſſe of this duty I have been preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon thee, that thou art deſirous to know thy Self and Sins, wouldeſt gladly find out, that thou mighteſt expel the plague of thy own heart; that I may do ſomething farther to help thee in thy Self-examination, I ſhall briefly endeavour to diſcover what thoſe ſins in our Nation are, for which eſpecially we are now plagued by the viſible hand of God: And the Lord awaken us all ſeriouſly to lay to heart, and remove them far from us, that ſo God having accompliſh't his own deſigns upon us, may lay by his Rod, and ſhew us his wonted favour. And let me beſeech thee, Reader, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company me with thy Conſcience, and let thy eye ſtill be turned off from the Book upon thy ſelf, and if thou ſeeſt thy own actions deſcribed, cry out, <hi>Guilty, guilty, I am the man;</hi> and ſo proceed in thy duty, as I have before directed, and ſhall not again repeat, except on the By.</p>
            <p>In the proſecution of this deſign, I ſhall ſay ſomething, 1. Of thoſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious crying ſins which are to be found amongſt us; of which, I ſhall need to ſay the leſſe, becauſe they are ſo viſible upon us, and ſo readily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be what they are, and becauſe ſo many Books are written to ſhame and ſuppreſs them. 2. I ſhall proceed to lay open ſome ſuch abuſes and corruptions amongſt us, which are not only ſinful in themſelves, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in part, ſecret cauſes of the former, which yet perhaps may not be appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to, nor acknowledged as ſuch by all.</p>
            <p>And once again, let me deſire every Reader to place himſelf, as at the Bar of God, and ſo to paſſe a true judgment upon himſelf; and not to quarrel with the Phyſitian, inſtead of falling out with the diſeaſe; nor be more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe from hearing the diſcoveries of the plague of his own heart, than he would be to hear his Phyſitian tell the Symptoms of the Plague, to convince him he was ſtruck with it, whil'ſt all this was but in order to his recovery. Whoever thou art that are guilty, 'tis thou haſt wounded thy ſelf; I would willingly ſhew thee thy Sores, that they might in time be healed; if thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution not to have ſearch't into them, make them uncurable, though I may never have thy thanks for the offer of my help, yet I know whom thou wilt accuſe as the cauſe of thy deſtruction, which I would fain have prevented, and ſhall do what I may in order thereto.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the Front of thoſe Abominations under the Effects whereof we groan, we may well place Adultery, Fornication and Laſciviouſneſs, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we conſider the provoking Nature, or the Commonneſs hereof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us. This is a ſin we often find attended with exemplary puniſhments in Scripture; for this, together with their Idolatry, we read of a <hi>Plague</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon the <hi>Iſraelites, Numb.</hi> 25. whereof dyed 24000. For <hi>Davids</hi> commiſſion of this but once, it was threatned to him, <hi>That the Sword ſhould</hi>

               <hi>never depart from his houſe,</hi> 2 Sam. 12. 10. And in the New Teſtament eſpecially, how frequent are the prohibitions, and how ſevere the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings denounc'd againſt it? <hi>Whoremongers and Adulterers,</hi> in a peculiar manner, <hi>God will judge.</hi> And for theſe things ſake eſpecially, we are told, comes the wrath of God upon the children of diſobedience. How ſtrict is our Saviours Expoſition of the Seventh Commandment, making a luſtful glance the breach of it? And upon the mention of that, immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the threatning of the whole body being caſt into Hell, without the cutting off the right hand, and plucking out the right eye, the ſubduing the deareſt luſts, and renouncing the ſweeteſt ſins, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 28, 29, 30. With what repetitions of the ſame do we find it mentioned, where it's ſpoken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, inculcated again and again, to take the deeper impreſſion? And when the luſts of the fleſh are named, uſually this is reckoned for the greater part of them in various expreſſions, ſignifying much what the ſame thing, <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſ.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Mortifie therefore,</hi> &amp;c. Fornication, Uncleanneſs, Inordinate Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, Evil Concupiſcence, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 3, 4. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 19. Now the works of the fleſh are manifeſt, which are theſe, <hi>Adultery, Fornication, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs, Laſciviouſneſs.</hi> This ſin we find much aggravated by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 13, 14. to the end; as that which in a particular manner defiles a man, and renders him indiſpoſed for the in-dwellings of the Holy Spirit. This loathſom wickedneſs doth eſpecially ſoften and brutifie men, and ſinks them from God into the ſenſitive life, and ſtupifies the higher parts of the Soul, and renders them unqualified for a converſe with that God, who commands all that will approach him, <hi>To be Holy, as he is Holy.</hi> And this is a ſinne which upon many accounts, breeds as much confuſion and diſorder in the world, as it does in particular mens Souls: It muſt needs therefore incenſe the moſt High God, to ſee his creatures endued with reaſon for the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of themſelves, to whom he hath preſcribed Rules for their walking, to degenerate into ſuch effeminate impotence, as to be hurried away by their own luſts, to ſuch beſtial uncleanneſs.</p>
            <p>But alas! How notoriouſly infamous is our Nation grown for filthineſs and lewdneſs! It cannot now be charged on the Pope alone, That Publick Stews are erected within his Juriſdiction; only yet here's this difference, Thoſe are (if Hiſtory, and Common Report ſpeak Truth) Licenc't: Ours are not demoliſh't. Nor yet perhaps are ours ſo publick, or certainly known, but yet too publick they are, to the diſgrace of our Nation, and Holy Profeſſion. Inſomuch that one would think <hi>

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54206:13"/>
would make it. And they are ready to cenſure his Laws as ſevere, for not allowing them the priviledges of Bruits; ſo ſtrangely doth frequency in ſin, wear out the ſenſe of it! And a ſenſual life doth even blind the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and bribe the Conſcience; till at length with much ado, men al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt perſwade themſelves, that they may do what they have often done, and are reſolved ſtill to perſiſt in.

What tell ye them of Rivers of pleaſures at Gods right hand? They muſt have their dirt to tumble and wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in. Take thoſe who will for them, they muſt have their Chambering and Wantonneſſe, and luſtful dalliances. Nothing muſt go for reaſon, with them which contradicted their ſenſual deſires; and is it not juſt, they ſhould then be dealt with ſutable to their Natures? That ſince nothing elſe would do it, Senſe and feeling may at length aſſure them, their ſweet and pleaſant ſins are a diſpleaſure to God, and moſt pernicious to themſelves: And if neither ſeeing the beginning of Gods wrath upon others, nor feeling it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves will prevail with them, God hath judgments in ſtore that ſhall extort from them, will they, or will they not, moſt paſſionate and hearty acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments, that whileſt they were ſatisfying their Luſts, they were moſt ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly contriving their own ruine, and treaſuring up wrath for themſelves againſt the day of wrath.

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54206:13"/>
Holineſſe of God, his Infinite purity and juſtice, and withall reflect upon his Omnipreſence, his All-ſearching eye that is upon the moſt ſecret actions; think but how he hath been a Witneſſe of all that Lewdneſſe that hath been committed in all places, in the greateſt privacies and retirements, not bars and bolts could keep him out, not drawn curtains, nor the darkeſt night could hide impure ſinners from his view; conſider we but theſe things, and ſhall we wonder if for theſe wickedneſſes the Lord be wroth with us, and pour out the Vyals of his fury upon us? How juſtly might God take up the complaint againſt us, which he did againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Jer. 5. 2, 8. <hi>When I had fed them to the full, they then committed Adultery, and aſſembled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by Troops in the Harlots houſes: They were as Jed Horſes in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, every one Neighed after his Neighbours wife.</hi> And what follows, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. <hi>Shall I not viſit for theſe things, ſaith the Lord? and ſhall not my ſoul be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged on ſuch a Nation as this?</hi> And oh now, that all thoſe, whoſe Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences condemn them for theſe things, would preſently ariſe, and take ſhame to themſelves, and do no more ſo wickedly, leſt worſe things yet befall them. And the good Lord awaken thoſe that are in Authority, to greater vigilance and induſtry for the future, in ſearching after, puniſhing and ſuppreſſing this Impiety wherewith we are ſo polluted; that the Viſitation now upon us, which hath ſo much the ſame cauſe with that laid on the <hi>Iſraelites, Num.</hi> 25. may alſo have the ſame ſpeedy and effectual cure, which we may read, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106. 29, 30. <hi>Thus they provok't him to anger with their inventions, and the Plague brake in upon them. Then ſtood up</hi> Phinehas, <hi>and executed iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſo the Plague was ſtayed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The two next Sins I ſhall mention, may paſſe for Appendices to this firſt, as having been too apparent promoters of it; which yet if they were not, may upon other Accounts be deſervedly reckoned amongſt the provoking ſins of the Land.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The former, is the Licentiouſneſſe of the Stage, where wickedneſſe, and amongſt other ſorts, wantonneſſe is more effectually taught, than it is decryed in the Pulpit. Let their Favourers talk what they will, of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing Virtue, and ſhaming Vice, I ſhould put it amongſt one of the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Times, to hear of any man Reform'd by a Play. If to hear o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, be the way to make men leave them; if to hear the Sacred Name of God profaned, his Word jeſted with, Religion it ſelf derided, be the way to make men Devout; if to hear Laſcivious Diſcourſe, and ſee Impudent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Actions, be the way to get Modeſty, then let us all flock to the Play-houſe. And next, from the ſame Reaſon, let Youth be brought up in a Brothel-houſe, to learn Chaſtity; at a Tavern, to avoid Drunkenneſſe; at a Gaming-houſe, to keep them from Curſing and Swearing. I have heard but few count it any great wiſdom in that Nation, where they were wont to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54206:14"/>
make their Servants drunk, to ſhew their Children the odiouſneſſe of it; and ſurely there was leſſe charity in it, to make ſome commit wickedneſſe, that they might prevent it in others. But when Vice ſhall be repreſented, yea, and commendably too, 'tis very great odds; but that they will ſoon turn Actors when they are gone away, who were even now Spectators of it. What is to be learn't at the Play-houſe, let the Converſations of moſt that plead for, and haunt them, evidence. And from the Lives, to the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the greateſt Admirers of a Play, do I appeal, Whether ever they got any real good from them, and whether they have not oft got evil. The precious time that is miſpent either in ſeeing, or afterwards talking of them, is not to be look't on as a thing of nothing; however it be ſleighted by thoſe wretched Sotts, that knowing neither God nor themſelves, have more time than they know well what to do with, and therefore are glad to run to their Playes and Sports, for nothing elſe but to help them away with it; and let not ſuch complain, if a Plague at once eaſe them of all that trouble, and carry them into an Eternity, where they ſhall never more have one of thoſe precious moments which here they were weary of, and knew not how to improve. And if they knew nothing they had to do here, but pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, God will caſt them into a world, where he will find them employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment enough, but of ſuch a nature, that they ſhall wiſh a thouſand and a thouſand times over, that they had ſpent all their dayes in the greateſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and ſtrictneſſe to have prevented it. Let the giddy careleſſe ones of the world cry as long as they will, What hurt is there in this, or the other Recreation or Merriments, that only waſts their time? If there was any hurt in the fire and brimſtone that fell upon <hi>Sodom,</hi> that which caus'd it, was no ſuch harmleſſe thing; and amongſt the ſins of that City, abundance of Idleneſſe is nam'd for one, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 49.</p>
            <p>Again, were it nothing elſe but that vanity and frothineſſe of mind, and unfitneſſe for all Religious duties, which Playes naturally produce, I think this was enough to make all Sober perſons regard them as little better than Peſt-houſes: And had our Gallants look't on them as ſuch, and accordingly ſhun'd them, they might not have had occaſion to avoid thoſe which are more dreadful, but leſſe hurtful. Would our wanton Youth, and idle Dames have kept out of theſe places of Infection, where Folly and Lightneſſe taint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them both by their eyes and ears, there might have been no ſuch infected places, which they are now ſo careful to avoid. For my own part, I muſt needs ſay, That I took it for a diſhonourable Reflection upon our Engliſh Prelacy, which a modern Poet makes his obſervation, in a Preface to a Book of Comedies, put forth in theſe late times, <hi>That Biſhops and Playes went down together.</hi> And ſure, if they could have hindred it, 'tis as little for their Honour, that they have both been reſtor'd together. I can ſcarce (but that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54206:14"/>
I ſhould prevent my ſelf) forbear crying out, when Preachers mouths are ſtopt; and Players opened, What ſad effects are like to follow! Surely the Primitive Chriſtians, whoſe moroſeneſs in refuſing to behold the Romane <hi>Spectacula</hi> (whatever difference there may be betwixt them, and our Stage-plays) was one great crime objected againſt them, would not have thought ſuch lewd and immodeſt Shews agreeable with their Profeſſion. But what talk I of them, a company of ſullen ſouls, much what like the people, we are wont to laugh at for Puritans? It is not my buſineſs now to argue, what a Play is in it ſelf, or what it may poſſibly be refind'd to; but I ſpeak of them with all thoſe corruptions with which they are now attended. And I would hope the ſame policy, a little more improv'd, which hath ſhut up the Play-houſes now, to prevent the ſpreading of the Infection, will keep them ſo, to hinder its return: Whoever may be diſpleaſed with this moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I am very confident, God is not, and then I am indifferent who is.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The latter of the two Sins, which I mention'd, as related to the firſt Particular, is Pride; and here amongſt all the ſorts of it, which might very well deſerve our notice, and with which no doubt God is provok'd, here I mean eſpecially Pride of Apparel: a Sin grown either ſo impudent, or ſo u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal, that our Pulpits do of late days ſeldom meddle with it. I am ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ready to think, Miniſters are aſham'd to concern themſelves with ſuch low and ridiculous things; (though I wiſh they are not ſilent for fear of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending their fine Hearers, which may chance to be of the beſt in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.) But if people will be ſo ridiculous and vain, and manifeſt ſuch childiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and folly, ſurely their Teachers muſt follow them, and condiſcend to diſcover to them all their miſtakes, and the ſubtle ways of the Deceiver of ſouls, who is very ready to play at any game for the ruine of poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and holds more in his ſlavery by this very vanity we are now inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on, than is ordinarily thought: we may find the great Apoſtles not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it below them to give Precepts in this matter, 1 Pet. 3. 3, 4, 5. <hi>Whoſe Adorning, let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, or wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of gold, or putting on of apparel,</hi> &amp;c. ſo alſo 1 Tim. 2. 9, 10. <hi>In like manner alſo, That women adorn themſelves in modeſt apparel, with ſhamefaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſobriety, not with broidered hair, or gold, or pearls<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or coſtly array; but, which becometh women profeſſing godlineſs with good works.</hi> Which commands how they have been violated, it concerns the guilty to lay to heart. As I would not be thought of their Opinion, who place their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſo much in Meats, Drinks, or Apparel, whether Papiſts in the former, or Quakers in the latter; ſo I am as far from thinking, that Religion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends not to theſe things: for though it be ſeated in the heart, it gives Laws to the outward Man. I rememember, it is an Obſervation of a moſt judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and learned Divine, That few of thoſe Errours or Sects that have
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54206:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
roſe up amongſt us, but have call'd upon us, to have regard to ſome neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected truth or duty, as he inſtanceth in ſeveral; And to adde one more, I think the Quakers are riſen up, keeping ſuch a ſtirre about Ribbonds, cuffs, and lace, and ſuch like things, to ſhame and condemn all, eſpecially the more ſtrict profeſſours of Religion, for that very great liberty they have aſſum'd to themſelves in their bravery, gaudineſs, and changeableneſs of Apparel. Had the Profeſſours of theſe latter times, made thoſe of the former (who were yet as careful of their hearts as any) their patterns in this matter, they had ſpoil'd the poor Quaker of half his Religion, and not given him an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to bring up a Sect, that ſhould go in plain and modeſt cloathing. But wiſe are they who ſhun both extreams.</p>
            <p>Doubtleſſe, this Pride in the outward man, is no ſuch a ſleight matter as 'tis commonly made. See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>Becauſe the Daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with ſtretch'tforth necks, and wanton eyes—Therefore will the Lord ſmite with a ſcab the crown of the head of the Daughters of Zion.</hi> And have we not had multitude, ſuch walking in our ſtreets? Read on that <hi>Chapter</hi> from the 16 <hi>verſe</hi> to the end, and tell me then whither God take not notice of, and is not diſpleaſ'd with this vanity, and curioſity in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel. Is not this indeed to be proud of our ſhame, ſince cloaths them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves had not been uſ'd, but for that ſhame which ſin introduc't? And I may well annex this to the ſin of wantonneſſe, both as diſcovering and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting it: For what's the deſign of all that art, coſt, and pains that perſons beſtow upon attiring themſelves, but to appear handſome and well ſet out? And what's this for, but to couch others eyes to be fixt on them? what are naked breaſts, and painted, and ſpotted faces deſign'd for, but as trapans and ſnares for the wanton beholders? And the dreſſe it ſelf by the laſcivious is made but a more plauſible kind of Pander. It may be worth the noting, that the word rendred effeminate, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9. is joyn'd with <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, and ſignifies ſoft clothing, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 8. which may intimate to us, that there is ſome relation betwixt ſuch clothing and effeminency. And whereas by the Texts above mentioned, it ſeems that women only were wont to be guilty of this folly; the delicate Youths of our time, will not ſuffer that Sex to engroſſe this ſin, and ſhame to themſelves, but are reſolved to go ſharers. Oh the intolerable expence of money and time, for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of this baſe monſtruous Pride! How many naked backs might be cloathed with half that coſt, which is laviſh't to put a man in a fools coat, or to hang about them ſuch baubles, as may ſerve people to ſtare at? and let the guilty bethink themſelves how to anſwer this their Liberality upon their Luſts, in the day of ſevere account, when all Talents ſhall be reckoned for. By that time at the fartheſt, if they be not convinc't that perſons of Honour and Eſtates, had been better diſtinguiſh'd by their Examples of Charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54206:15"/>
than by gaudy Garments, or rich Jewels, let me paſs for a falſe Prophet. Though I ſpe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>k not this of thoſe Robes and Ornaments of the Magiſtrate, which are neceſſary for diſtinction ſake, and to acquire greater reverence to his place and perſon. But let all thoſe who are at ſo much charge in their Attire, to let the World know they are Some-body, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber this, <hi>That God entruſted them not with Eſtates for them thus to make ſhew of, but to uſe for his Service.</hi> And I think any body will ſay, that he's an unfaithful Steward with a witneſſe, who when his Lord hath given him mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to lay out in neceſſary uſes, ſhall throw it about ſtreets, to let people know what ſtore of money he hath the keeping of: Thou who canſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn ſuch an one, ſee thou do nothing like him. Whoever thou art that haſt been guilty of this fault, ſurely thou wilt acknowledge this is a day that calls for the laying aſide of thy braveries and ornaments, and rather to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thy ſelf with Sackcloth and Aſhes. But if yet thy Pride will not ſuffer thee to part with them, bethink thy ſelf what thy naked Soul ſhall wear in that place whither God hath expreſly threatned to turn the proud. <hi>Dives</hi> there muſt not have his Silk and fine Linnen, but inſtead of them, the purple flames are his unchangeable cloathing.</p>
            <p>Is it any wonder then, if as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were plagued for worſhipping the Idol which was made of their Ear-rings and Jewels, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 3, 35. We meet with the ſame puniſhment for a ſin not much different, even for making ſuch Toyes themſelves our Idols. Strange judgments may well fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſtrange apparel; yea, ſuch that wear it, God hath plainly threatned, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1. 8. And what ſtrange apparel for both men and women have the Devil, Pride, and <hi>Fraunce</hi> help't us to? And they who caught this ſin one of another, pleading Faſhion for their Juſtification, are they not juſtly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with a Diſeaſe that is Contagious too? The Spots which Pride and Wantonneſſe, thoſe plagues of the heart, ſent into the face before, are they not fitly puniſh't with Spots of another hue! Is it not exceeding juſt, that they who were ſo far fal'n in love with their comely Carkaſſes, that they were wholly devoted to deck and trim them; ſhould have ſuch loathſom Botches, and noiſom biles and Riſings upon them, as might convince them how little better than Carrion is that fleſh they ſo much pamper and adorn? And let them now think what pleaſure or eaſe is to be had from putting on their ſplendid fineſt Array, when the Plague-Sores ſhall be running upon them; even much-what the ſame that <hi>Herod</hi> had from his Royal Apparel, when he was eaten up of Worms, <hi>Acts</hi> 12. 21, 23. And if in ſuch a caſe they would have little mind to ſtand tricking and trimming them, let them know that the Ulcers and Sores of their polluted Souls, and proud hearts, call for as ſpeedy, and earneſt reg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

who ſurvive, may take warning in time, before their bodies are humbled to the Duſt, and their Souls to Hell, for their daring, impudent pride.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Another heinous ſin which hath overſpread our Land, is Swiniſh Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe and Gluttony: This alſo may well be joined with thoſe before mentioned, as being the ground and incentive of all other Lewdneſſe and wickedneſſe. But alas! How hath the Commonneſſe of this Vice, and mens cuſtom in it, taken away thoſe odious apprehenſions which Scripture helps us to, and all ſober men have of it? Oh, how are our Taverns and Alehouſes, in all parts of the Kingdom, frequented! How doth our whole Nation ſeem even ready to Reel into its own Ruines, being ſeized with the Vertigo of an Epidemical Drunkenneſſe? How Gentile, and faſhionable a thing is it now grown, for men to be drunk, in Civility to the Company they are engaged in? How many Tricks have they deviſed for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of this ſin, notwithſtanding the moſt expreſſe Injunctions and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations to the contrary? Profane Cuſtom hath ſo overſwayed, That drinking of Healths, muſt be the Teſt of Mens Loyalty; and of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to thoſe great Ones, to whom the beginner ſhall conſecrate his Bowl; as if a diſorderlineſſe, which ſcarce any Beaſt will be guilty of, muſt ſhew good Manners; and no man could be a good Subject to his King, which dare not Rebel againſt his God. Thoſe that dare, are valiant men indeed; but ſuch, as when it comes to tryal, will do little more for their Prince, than they do for their Maker. So general is this practice of exceſſive drinking grown, that both the Gallant and the Clown, Rich and Poor, Young and Old, yea, Women as well as Men, City and Countrey, are fadly infected with the ſame. In too many places, he's ſcarce accounted a good Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper, that let's his Neighbours go out of his houſe ſober. How can men entertain their Friends, or renew their Acquaintance, or drive any Bargain, without betaking themſelves to ſome Tipling-houſe? Yea, how frequently are Drinking-matches appointed, for no other purpoſe, but to pour down their Liquor? What multitudes are there, <hi>Who riſe up to drink ſtrong drink, who tarry at Night till Wine inflame them?</hi> Yea, to ſuch an height of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe are we grown, that as if there was ſome excellency in ſinning, men ſtrive for the Maſtery in it; and to be able to drink down others, goes for a very Manly Faculty. Such enemies have we got to the Croſs of Chriſt, <hi>whoſe God is their belly, whoſe glory is their ſhame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And is there not the ſame Reaſon, that our Crown of Pride, and the Drunkards of <hi>England</hi> ſhould be trodden down, as well as of <hi>Ephraim, Iſa.</hi> 28. 3. Is it not juſt, that they whoſe Intemperance hath often deprived them of their Reaſon, ſhould be taken with a Diſtemper that may ſtrip them of the uſe of it? That in thoſe very ſtreets where men have ſtagger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and fallen down dead-drunk, they ſhould there fall down ſtark-dead?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:54206:16"/>
The like might be ſaid of Gluttony, and Luxurious Feaſtings, a ſin more confin'd to the greater Sort, who can make ſufficient proviſions for the fleſh, to fulfill the Luſts thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> abundantly confirming what the Wiſe man hath told us, <hi>That the proſperity of Fools deſtroys them.</hi> And what a wiſer than he hath expreſly affirmed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though ſure believ'd but by very few, <hi>That Rich men do difficultly enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> How much money is expended but once, to furniſh the Tables of theſe gluttonous Epicures? How do they Sacrifice Gods Creatures meerly to their Luſts, eating only for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and to keep themſelves alive from one Meal to another, without think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that Service they owe to God for all. <hi>They have lived in pleaſure, and been wanton, nouriſhing their hearts, as in a day of ſlaughter,</hi> as St. <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 5. What hath been the Life of too many of our Gentry, but to eat and drink, and ſleep, and riſe up to play? Here's the improvement of the many ſpecial engagements God hath laid on them to honour him, that they of all will do leaſt to his honour. What an exact deſcription may we read of many of them, <hi>Amos</hi> 6. 3, 4, 5, 6. <hi>Ye that put away far the evil day, and cauſe the ſeat of violence to come near: That lie upon the Beds of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vory, and ſtretch themſelves upon their Couches, and eat the Lambs out of the flock, and the Calves out of the midſt of the ſtall: That chaunt to the ſound of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iel, and invent to themſelves inſtruments of muſick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> like</hi> David: <hi>That drink Wine in bowls, and anoint themſelves with the chief oyntments: but they are not grieved for the affliction of</hi> Joſeph. And there read on, you may find their doom: <hi>If men will bid their ſouls take their eaſe, eat, drink, and be merry, well may they expect quickly to hear, Your ſouls ſhall be taken from you.</hi> And when they are thus provoking God to anger with their eating and drinking, what wonder if his wrath fall upon them, whil'ſt the meat is in their mouths? If they ſo far forget their own natures, and the uſe of his creatures, as wholly to be devoted to the ſatisfaction of their raging ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al deſires, which they ought chiefly to have denied; and if like unprofitable burdens of the earth, they fed themſelves only that they might live longer to taſte the pleaſure of their delicious meats and drinks, how juſt is it that when like Swine they were fatted, they ſhould there be brought to the ſlaughter?</p>
            <p n="5">5. As the next provoking Sin which is rife amongſt us, I ſhall reckon Swearing, Curſing, and Profaning the moſt holy Name of the dreadful God. A ſin leſs excuſable than Epicuriſm, becauſe I know no ſenſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but though it be leſs beſtial, yet is it more Diabolical. Oh the horrid Oaths that have been daily belch'd out by the black-mouth'd Sons of <hi>Belial!</hi> Who almoſt could walk the ſtreets of the City without ſtopping his ears? Or elſe he was like to hear the Name of God abus'd; the Life, the Blood, the Wounds of our dear and precious Lord toſt too and fro, by the mouths of wretched Swearers. Who, that had heard all
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54206:17"/>
the Oaths and Curſes that were vented but in one day, in this one City of <hi>London,</hi> would not have admired, that their tongues, who were thus ſet on fire on Hell, did not ſet our whole Nation in a flame? Oh well is it for us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that our God, who is mercy it ſelf, rules in the World? How quickly would all created Patience, though meeting in one Perſon, be quite tired out, and worn away? Theſe helliſh Exhalations ſtreaming forth from the hearts and mouths of corrupted men, whereby they have aſſaulted even Heaven it ſelf, might juſtly have been kindled by the wrath of God, and have been returned upon our heads in ſhowrs of Fire and Brimſtone. And if the polluted breath of theſe kind of wretches, have infected the very Air we breath in, 'tis not to be thought ſtrange in the leaſt. Could thoſe volleys of Blaſphemies which have been diſcharg'd againſt the glorious Majeſty, do any other than turn to a black cloud, which ſhould light heavily upon us? Some think it impoſſible for the ſoul of man ſo far to ſink into the Deviliſh Nature, as to ſin meerly, to ſin without a regard to ſome carnal intereſt: but if any inſtance will evidence it, I think 'tis Swearing and Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing! 'Tis poſſible I know (though this is far from excuſing it) for Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to tranſport men to an Oath; and ſometimes a deſire to be believed, ſometimes an ignorance that they do amiſs, may betray them into it; but for men to enterlard their ordinary diſcourſe with full-mouth'd Oaths, priding themſelves therein, as if Gentile and Graceful, What Excuſe can be invented for ſuch horrible Practices? Nay, when men ſhall ſet themſelves purpoſely to ſwear, and deviſe new Oaths that ſhall be <hi>al a mode,</hi> What poſſible pretence have they for this? And hither may I refer thoſe ſtrange, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of Prodigies of Profaneneſs; Wickedneſſes too Tranſcendental to be rank'd under any ordinary Topick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Such as killing men in a <hi>bravado,</hi> drinking Healths of their own blood, yea, Healthing it to the Devil him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: for ſuch—I know not what to call them, as theſe are we reported to have had amongſt us, nay (canſt thou imagine it Reader?) far worſe than theſe, which let thoſe mention who are Maſters enough of our Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage to render them in fit terms: for I profeſs, I cannot. So unwilling are the daring Fellows of our days to go to Hell in the old way! It cannot conſiſt with the greatneſs of their ſpirits, to be wicked at theſe low rates, that their ſilly Anceſtours were. In all they do, they would be taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, and appear above the Vulgar. And would proclaim to all men, that they are none of thoſe melancholy, weak-brain'd, or mean-ſpirited men, who are ſo aw<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d with the apprehenſions of a God, that they dare not ſin freely and boldly. No, but they have ſo far conquered thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices they had conceived of vertue, and vice, ſin, and ſhame, that they dare in the open Sun commit thoſe ſins, which Cowards run into the dark for. They are not aſham'd to own themſelves the Devils Vaſſals, but
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54206:17"/>
dance in his fetters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whilſt all men hear their cackling. What other deſign can theſe ſwaggering Sinners have in ſuch a carriage, but audaciouſly to affront the great Majeſty of Heaven and Earth, in the higheſt manner they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable? Ah beſotted Wretches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Let me beſpeak you in the language of the Prophet, Do you know againſt whom you ſhoot out the lip, and make a wide mouth? What could your wit find no other way to vent it ſelf, nor your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, any other Object? Had you no cheaper way to undo your ſelves? Were you afraid leſt you ſhould have miſs't of Hell? What? Did you indeed mean by your Blaſphemies to dare God to his face? Would you force him to give a convincing evidence of his Being? If ſo, I hope you are ſatisfied by this time, If not, you ſhall be ſhortly. Was you reſolv'd to try how far his Patience would extend? Did you fear he was ſo merciful, that you ſhould never feel his wrath? Or were you in ſuch haſte to be with your everlaſting Companions, the Devils and the Damned, that you thought your Judgment lingred, and Damnation ſlumbred, and would therefore do your beſt to haſten it? Or were you ſo fully bent on the ſatisfaction of your luſts, that you were reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to purſue them even to the burning lake, and therefore thought you had ee'n as good go to Hell for ſomthing, &amp; would make to your ſelves as good a bargain as you could, and do all that in you lay before-hand, o revenge your ſelves of that God, who will there treat you ſo ſeverely? or were you now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times inuring your ſelves to the language of Hell, that you might not be to learn when you ſhould be thrown thither? Theſe are ſtrange Suppoſitions the Reader may think, but not ſo ſtrange as the Sins I am ſpeaking of, and for which, I can ſcarce aſſign other reaſons than ſuch as theſe. And ſhall we won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, when ſuch Rebels are riſen up againſt the Lord, if he grow jealous for his great Name, and ariſe, and vindicate his Glory and Power from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuous affronts of inſolent Mortals. Moreover, how many times have People in their Execrations wiſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>t, That the Pox and the Plague might take Themſelves, their Children, Servants, or Cattle? And can they find fault, if at length, their deſires are granted? Yea, how many Roaring Ruffians have we got, who, as if they were already entered into the familiarity of Devils, make nothing of it to curſe themſelves to the pit of hell in their common diſcourſe; who can ſcarce ſpeak a ſentence without their <hi>Dammee's</hi> and <hi>Sinkmee's?</hi> Whoſe tongues, were they pluck't out by the Roots, it was a puniſhment no way ſuited to the heinouſneſſe of their crime. But let them, if they think fit, ſtay a while longer in their contempt of God, and his threatnings, and their reſolute diſobedience to his holy Laws, and if nothing elſe will ſerve their turn, they ſhall too ſoon to their ſorrow, find all their accurſed prayers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh't. The Devil, whom they have ſo oft wiſh't to fetch them, ſhall very ſhortly have that Commiſſion which he eagerly waits for, and then let them ſay whether the dreadful God be to be jeſted with, or abus'd: And
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:54206:18"/>
then at length ſhall they hear that terrible queſtion thundred againſt them, <hi>Have you provok'd me, ſaith the Lord, Have you not provok'd your ſelves to the confuſion of your own faces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>

            <p n="6">6. Amongſt the reſt of our commonſins we may account Covetouſneſs, together with all the diſcoveries, effects and branches of it; Such as Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, Extortion, Bribery, Injuſtice, either in judgment or mutual traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique, over-reaching each other, Uncharitableneſs, and grinding the faces of the Poor. I put all theſe together, as having ſome relation to each other, and being all neglects of duty betwixt man and man. If Idolatry ſo often brought the Plague, or other Sufferings upon the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> why may not Covetouſneſſe which is Idolatry, by the ſame reaſon bring it upon us: Is it not as diſpleaſing to God to have men adore an heap of Gold and Silver, or their Houſes and Lands, as an Image of Gold made up into humane ſhape? And is it not as great a ſin, for the heart to run a whoring after theſe things, as to bow the body to an Idol? And how are men almoſt every where ſet with all their might and main to thrive, and riſe in the world, to lade themſelves with thick clay, and here to lay up their Treaſures? Was it not time for us then to be told, and told to the quick what we were do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? That we were not yet at home, and muſt not therefore think of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling here? Single deaths of men when there died now one, then another, had but little effect on us, to make us ſenſible of our own Mortality, and therefore multitudes are ſwept away before our eyes, to ſee if that will have any more influence upon us. With what unwearied, and uninterrupted pains and diligence did the moſt drudg about their earthly affairs, from mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to night, weeks end to weeks end, without any ſerious regard to the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs they came into the world for? but were ſo deeply faln in love with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent things, that they dream not of a Removal? And withal were ſo plung'd over head &amp; ears in their cares and buſineſſes, that they could not find a time, for any ſerious Conſideration of the matters of their ſouls? How juſt is it then that God ſhould take them off by his hand, if they knew not how to diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage themſelves? And ſnatch them away from thoſe Eſtates which they knew no better how to improve, but were even neſtling themſelves in them, as their durable poſſeſſions. And I hope all who are engag'd in ſuch affairs, will call themſelves to a ſtrict account whether there have been no ſuch unjuſt ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces pronounc'd either in condemning the innocent, or acquitting the guilty, that may have provok't the juſt God to anger againſt us. And let all mercileſs rich men, cruel Extortioners, oppreſſive Landlords lay to heart their unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifulneſſe, rigour or injuſtice to the Poor, to the Fatherleſſe and Widow, whoſe cries may have reacht the ears of the Lord of Sabboth, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 4. and cauſ'd him to riſe and plead their cauſe, by ſending his Judgments upon an hard-hearted Generation. And doubtleſſe that great want of Charity,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54206:18"/>
and Chriſtian compaſſion which ought to be in us, towards our Brethren in their neceſſities and miſeries, may very juſtly have hardned God himſelf againſt us, and caus'd him to be deaf, to our Cries and Prayers. How many have had their money and precious things which they had hoarded, left to ſtrangers, or rifled by theeviſh hands, which they might in their life-time ſo well imploy'd for Gods honour, and their own good? But alas, amongſt the many that profeſſe the Faith, how few are there who will take a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe from God as good ſecurity? And amongſt ſo many that ſay they love God, how few have manifeſted it by their love to their Brother? And hath the matter been mended, ſince we have been under this ſore Viſitation? Nay, rather hath it been worſe? Oh how men ſhut up their bowels againſt their poor, neceſſitous, Viſited Brethren? And ſuffered ('tis ſadly to be feared) thouſands to ſtarve for want of needful ſupplies, whilſt they have had enough for their Luſts, and to ſpare; and need not (which yet in ſuch a day eſpecially is our duty) have pinch't their own back or belly to have afforded them relief. And this cruelty have men been guilty of whilſt many of them had reaſon every day to expect their own Death; but they have ſeem'd reſolv'd to hold, and graſp all as long as poſſibly they can, and to cleave cloſer, if they knew how, to their dear Mammon, of which ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they muſt take their ſad, and laſt farewell, Oh! who but Infidels would not have ſent their Treaſures before them thither, where they expect ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be themſelves Tranſlated. But the Sin I chiefly intended under this head, is the common diſhoneſty in Buying and Selling, mens Defrauding and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verreaching each other. A practiſe which I fear, <hi>London</hi> hath been more guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of than <hi>Corinth</hi> which yet was charg'd with it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 8. And it concerns Citizens and Tradeſmen eſpecially, to enquire into themſelves upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, as being moſt expos'd to temptations to it. Thou who yet ſurviveſt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine thy heart, look back on thy former courſe of Life, in thy following the world. Does not thy conſcience accuſe thee for having grown rich by Lying, Cheating, and Deceitful ways? Hath not thy Conſcience many times flows in thy face, for thy notorious Falſhoods, and crafty projects, and unlawful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, to put off thy wares, and enrich thy ſelf? Alas men are ready to plead a kind of neceſſity for their ſin; and ſay, If they ſhould always be upright, and plain, and true, they ſhould never know how to live. Is not the world then come to a brave paſſe? What a matter of courſe is it with Tradeſmen to tell multitudes of Lyes to every Cuſtomer almoſt, and never make mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of them, ſo they but help off their Commodities? They can go their ways, and wipe their mouths, and there's an end; But hold, God will not put it up ſo. So they can but now get a Pound or a Shilling, how little do they regard the time of reckoning for all again? They know not how to keep up ſuch ſerious thoughts in the midſt of their noiſe and buſle, in buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54206:19"/>
and ſelling. But if they can't, God will take them off their hot tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and give them leaſure enough to conſider what they have been doing. And hath he not done thus? 'Tis well for thoſe who ſo improve their brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſpace here, that they have not this work to do in the other world. All that men could think of, was, that mony was to be got, which way it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered not ſo much. And well had it been for them, if God had made no more matter of it: But believe it he hath taken a ſtrict notice of all thy ways, and recordeth them with greater exactneſſe, than thou waſt wont to do thy debts in thy Shop-book. See thy ſin deſcrib'd and threatned. <hi>Micah</hi> 6. 10, 11, 12, 13. After he had ſpoke of the Lords voice crying to the City by his Rod, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. then follows, <hi>Are there yet the treaſures of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the houſe of the wicked, and the ſcant meaſure which is abominable? Shall I count them pure with the wicked balances, and with the bag of deceitful weights? For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the Inhabitants have ſpoken lyes, and their tongue is deceitful in their mouths; Therefore alſo will I make thee ſick in ſmiting thee, in making thee deſolate becauſe of thy ſin.</hi> Oh how many are there that will be Religious, as far as coming to Church, and being devout there, and making ſome outſide Profeſſion, who yet in their dealings are ſtark naught, and will be diſhoneſt for a ſmall gain? In the Church, and perhaps a little in their Cloſets, they can afford to do, that they call ſerving of God, but in their Shops nothing at all. Oh by that time all's reckoned for, when the moneys gone, but the ſin in getting it muſt be anſwered for, how will men wiſh, and wiſh again they had been clear from this guilt, though they had been the meaneſt beggars in the Land? now how juſt is it man ſhould be ſnatcht from thoſe eſtates, to which theyne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had a true title? And if indeed they cannot drive a trade without ſo great miſcarriages, Is it not time that their Houſes and Shops ſhould be ſhut up?</p>
            <p n="7">7. The next Sin we ſhall take notice of, is Murder; which ſurely, if any, hath a crying voice. <hi>Abels</hi> blood ſoon wrought Heaven with its cry for vengeance. And how many Murders have we daily heard of, committed amongſt us? How common is it grown for the Gallants of our times, to Sacrifice one another Lives to their Luſts, to their Paſſion, or their Pride? And I wiſh that the impunity of ſome, may not have encouraged others. Is it not time then for God to take the Sword into his own hand, and let his audacious Creatures know, that their Lives they are ſo prodigal of are his, and at his diſpoſure? And if they value them at no higher rates, they have no reaſon to complain if they are taken away, ſince they knew no better what to do with them. If indeed they are ſo weary of the world, they ſhall ſtay no longer in it.</p>
            <p>And here eſpecially, let me bring to remembrance that Heatheniſh prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of Duelling; which of late is grown ſo much in faſhion, that none
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54206:19"/>
muſt paſſe for a Gentleman, but he who dare murder his brother; and to be an Hector, is more commendable than a Chriſtian. The Example and Precepts of that pattern, and Maſter of Meekneſſe the Holy Jeſus, the very mention of them is little leſs than ridiculous to our Brave Fellows. Alas, thoſe Precepts ſeem ſuited to the mean ſtate of Chriſtianity, when poor Fiſhermen and Tent-makers were the Preachers, and tradeſmen like them, were for the moſt part Retainers to it; but we muſt have them calculated again for thoſe of a more Elevated Meridian; <hi>viz.</hi> for our Gentry who had the luck to be born of Parents that were cal'd Chriſtian. The Jeſuite muſt fit them with rules that ſhall allow for their birth and breeding: for ſurely Chriſt never meant to have Gentlemen his Diſciples, when he tied them up to ſuch ſtrict commands, not practicable by men of their blood and Spirits. Religion now adays is thought to emaſculate men, and render them tame and cowardly. Baſely to ſubmit themſelves to their own unruly paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with theſe is Courage; To be Bears and Tygers, is accounted Gentle and Manly. Theſe are the Lordly creatures that are ſo tender of their Honors, that they will rather violate the Laws of the great God, than the leaſt Punctilio of it. To humour or win a Fantaſtical Miſtreſſe ('tis well they are not in hearing when I call her ſo) they durſt venture upon the wrath of their maker. For the wall, or the way, for a wry word, or a ſtraw, they durſt venture their necks to the Halter, and their ſouls to the Devil. Are not theſe the true Sons of Valour? Such that even in cold blood, and upon ſober deliberation dare damn themſelves? And why? becauſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth they are afraid of being call'd Cowards, and abus'd by every body elſe, ſhould they have paſt by one injury. They could tell what this was, but what the Hell they leapt into was, they knew not till they found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves there; and by that time poor wretches how was their courage cool'd? And now at length you valiant Fighters, wonder not if God himſelf be ſtept into the Field againſt you. What? do you think you have met with your match yet? Nay, but he hath not yet appeared with all his ſtrength. He hath only ſent one of his Warriours, Death ſitting upon the Pale-Horſe, but ſee what a terrible Second there is, Hell follow'd after him. <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 8. But come try your Manhood upon this firſt. The hour he appoints is, when he pleaſeth; the Weapon he now chiefly fights with is the Plague, take you what you will; the Place is <hi>London.</hi> What Cowards, do you turn your backs now? Are you afraid to Dye, and yet are not afraid to be Damn'd? What will you laugh at Hell, and now quake at Death, and flie from it? But think not your heels can ſecure you, nor any place you can flie to, ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or later be ſure hee'l find you out. What did you challenge God to the Combat and now do you run for't? Can you deny it? What elſe meant all your open, impudent wickedneſſe, but to bid God do his worſt? For to fin
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54206:20"/>
you were reſolved, let him right himſelf how he could. God threw down his Gauntlet, when he ſaid, <hi>The Soul that ſins ſhall dye.</hi> You took it up, when y ou ruſh't upon thoſe ſins. What, you miſerable Caitiffs, you Children of the Devil, who is a Murderer, muſt you ſtand upon your terms, and command obſervance from your Companny, and will draw at the leaſt Affront, and ſhall God be careleſſe of his Honour? Was it not preſent death for a man to throw a Glaſſe of Liquor in your face? And have you done leſſe againſt God one day after another, by pouring down your ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous Glaſſes? Did the Lye deſerve the ſtab, and ſhall you go Scot-free, who have ſo often given the Lye to God himſelf, ſpeaking to you by his Word and Miniſters, his Spirit and your own Conſciences? Nay, what you count the moſt unſufferable Reproach, have you not been ready to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret Gods Patience for Cowardice? Well, you are wont to call your ſelves Gentlemen: Know then, That for theſe, and a multitude of ſuch Affronts, God demands Satisfaction, and have it he will one way or other. Your ſpeedy Repentance, and believing recourſe to the blood that ſpeaks better things than that of murdered <hi>Abel,</hi> may appeaſe him; otherwiſe, when he makes Inquiſition for blood, hee'l take the proudeſt of you by the Throat, and caſt you to the Tormentors, and verily you ſhall not come thence, till you have paid the utmoſt Farthing.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Another very heinous ſin amongſt us, is Prophanation of the Lords Day, and neglect of the Worſhip of God. How many are idling away their time at home, or which is worſe, ſinning it away in Tipling-houſes, whileſt they ſhould be attending the Publick Service of God? Or if they afford their bodily preſence there for an hour or two, how ſoon after do they betake themſelves to their pleaſures, as if the reſt of the day were their own? Or as if when they had prayed to God, to keep them that day with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin, they might boldly commit it? As if when they had beg'd of God, to teach them to keep (amongſt the reſt) the Fourth Commandment, they might then take Liberty to break it? And by their after-practice, one would judge their prayer had been, <hi>Lord have mercy upon us, and give us leave to break this thy Law.</hi> Some go to their Drunken Companions, ſome to their Sports; others to walk idly in the ſtreets or fields; and the moſt to their common, vain and worldly diſcourſe: To any thing, rather than to private meditation, or Family-repetition of what they have heard. How far are men from ſpending this day, as beſeems thoſe who have Immortal Souls to care for, and can ſpare but little time on week-dayes for ſuch em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments? Oh how exceeding few are there that are willing rightly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form themſelves of the nature, uſe and end of this day, and accordingly to improve it? As it is a day ſet apart to commemorate not only the work of Creation, but chiefly of Redemption by Chriſt our Lord, and eſpecially his
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:54206:20"/>
Reſurrection, that being to him as a kind of reſt from his Labours: And moreover, as it may be to us a Type and a Reſemblance of the Eternal Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batiſm we ſhall enjoy in the Heavens: When we ſhall reſt from all ſinful, troubleſom, and bodily works, and be wholly employ'd in the admiration, and praiſe of that Divine Love, which contriv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d and wrought our Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption and Salvation. To have leave thus to ſpend a day with and for God, would be ſufficient to engage holy and ingenious Souls, with all alacrity and thankfulneſſe to embrace the opportunity. Such would be aſham'd to ſtand reaſoning and enquiring whether they might not halve it with God, and rob him and themſelves of a good part. What a ſtrange tedious thing is it for poor Creatures, that know not God, nor their own neceſſities, to be obliged to conſecrate One day in Seven to ſpiritual Services, for which, awakened and experienc't Souls think their whole Life-time little enough? How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have we had crying, like thoſe, <hi>Amos</hi> 8. 5. <hi>When will the New Moon be gone, and the Sabbath over?</hi> That they might again to their pleaſures, or enjoyments! Nay, our People have been in more haſte than ſo, they could not ſtay till the Sabbath was over, but muſt to their bargaining, their buying and ſelling. How frequent is this with many Shop-keepers in the City, when no neceſſity requires it? Well, if indeed you are ſo eagerly bent on your buſineſs, that you will not keep a Sabbath which God commands you, hee'l force you to another kind of Sabbath than this, which you ſhall have more reaſon to cry out, <hi>When will it be over?</hi> You ſhall be made to reſt from your works longer than this comes to, if you cannot afford God that ſmall ſpace of time he affords you: And you that were wont to be ſo wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Prayer and Sermon, and ſhift poſtures, firſt up, and then down, peeping at the Glaſſe, or your Watch; Is it not equal that you ſhould be held with thoſe pains which ſhall make you weary for ſomewhat? when you ſhall turn from ſide to ſide, but get no eaſe, and count all the tedious hours of the night, expecting every moment to ſink into that woful ſtate, where are no more dayes, or nights, or hours, where you ſhall never have a moments reſt through a whole Eternity! And then ſay whether the Service of God, or the Sufferings you feel from God, be the more tedious. If wicked wretches thus looſely encroach upon the Lords own day, may we not well fear leſt God ſhould depopulate our Land, that ſo at length it may enjoy its Sabbaths? And is it not juſt they ſhould be ſeized with a diſeaſe, which admits not of a Miniſter to viſit them, who in the time of life and health did ſo little care for their Miniſter? How many who have been ſhut up from all converſe with men, were wont formerly to excommunicate themſelves from the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Congregation? And if they would not ſtir over their Threſhold to the Church, 'tis juſt they ſhould not ſtir out at all. And may we not ſee many doors praying now, whoſe owners were not before wont to pray either in
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54206:21"/>
Publick, or with their Families, on the Lords Day, or any other time? Nay, perhaps, might be deriders of all ſerious praying, and only uſe to take Gods Name in vain with their Formalities: Is it not juſt then, that thoſe who were utterly unacquainted with, and it may be jeer'd at, praying by the Spirit, ſhould be taught by the feeling of their fleſh, to groan out an hearty <hi>Lord have mercy upon us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. Another very common ſin, ſomewhat related to the former, is the contempt and abuſe of the Ordinances of Chriſt, eſpecially the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; whileſt ſo many partake of the Table of the Lord, and in ſome ſenſe of the Table of Devils; which, what is it but to provoke the Lord to jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, as if we were ſtronger than he? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 21, 22. Many there are indeed, whoſe Hypocriſie and Treachery is only known to God, and though the Miniſter cannot, yet theſe he will find out. To vow obedience to God, whil'ſt we intend and perform nothing leſſe, this is ſuch a wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſo ſolemnly to mock him, as he will not bear at his creatures hands: And how many Thouſands are guilty of ſuch falſhood and perjury? For the breach of theſe Oaths be ſure the Land mourns. When each member of the Church thus Covenants to Reform himſelf, and yet ſtill continues in wickedneſſe. How is the receiving this Sacrament made a meer matter of courſe? And if it be remembred for a day it's well, but the engagement then made is preſently forgot. But believe it, God will not forget it ſo. How many have we, that are Celebrating the remembrance of Chriſts death to day, who are Crucifying him again to morrow? And ſuch as theſe, I chiefly intend, who whil'ſt they cuſtomarily renew their obligations, to live to the honour of their Lord, do what in them lies to put him to an open ſhame. And where is the place where difference is put betwixt the precious and the vile, and any ſcruple made of caſting Pearls before Swine, Childrens bread to Dogs? Whoſoever's fault this is, that it is a fault, and a very hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous one too, can hardly be denied by any that uſe to read, what Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions Scripture requires of all that are admitted, not only to ſome more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Ordinances, but into Church-communion. If covetous perſons, Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards, Swearers, Whoremongers, and all diſorderly Walkers are to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, withdrawn from, and not to be eaten with (take the word in what ſenſe you will) then let the moſt impartial, charitable perſon judge, what a vaſt and ſad difference there is betwixt the precept, and our practice. <hi>Si hoc ſit Evangelium, non ſumus Evangelici.</hi> Where are they that walk after this Rule? And 'tis not likely that this very ſin which brought ſickneſſes and death upon the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> ſhould have loſt its provoking nature by the tract of time, or any difference of circumſtances betwixt us and them. It cannot ſurely be thought that the Commonneſſe of this miſcarriage, nor yet the difficulty and ſeeming impoſſibility which ſome are apt to pretend of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54206:21"/>
having it remedied, ſhould render it leſſe diſpleaſing to that Holy God, who is ſo jealous about his Sanctuary. If <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah</hi> was ſmitten for his too bold officiouſneſſe in ſtaying the tottering Ark, and 50070 men of the <hi>Bethſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites</hi> for their curioſity in prying into it, how ſhall they be able to ſtand before the Lord in the day of his vengeance, who have ſo profan'd his holy Ordinances! Intereſt ſometimes reſtrains men from puniſhing a crime that is univerſal, but believe it, this takes no place in God: No, to his mercy we owe it only, that our puniſhment is not as extenſive as our guilt. But ſurely this his Beſom of deſtruction with which he ſweeps away multitudes, clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeaks it ſelf ſent to ſcourge a general ſin, and I know none more than this we are now upon. And it is not mens Lazineſſe, or carnal intereſts; their lothneſſe to diſpleaſe either the Vulgar, or Great Ones, by whom they live, that ſhall here, or in the day of their appearance before the great Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver and Judge, excuſe their diſobedience to his ſo expreſſe and perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Injunctions. To tell them then, that his Commands were inconſiſtent with their eaſe, or the favour of men, which is the voyce of their preſent negligence; will hardly excuſe them who have ſo often told others, That no man can be Chriſts Diſciple (much leſs then a Miniſter) without very great meaſures of Self-denial. If any of thoſe, whom they now pleaſe by their cowardice and compliance, will then bear them out, they are ſafe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; but if that is not to be expected, they had beſt bethink themſelves in time, how to give a comfortable account of their Stewardſhip. Though private members performing their duty, may not juſtly pretend the Paſtors negligence to juſtifie a Separation; yet how far others aſſuming a power to themſelves, if they execute it not, will excuſe thoſe who are deputed to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe theſe myſteries, when they ſhall deliver them to ſuch whom they have good reaſon to think unworthy, it behoves them who are concerned well to conſider. The unworthy receiver himſelf, it may be, hath ſome pretence or other, to ſhift the blame from off him, as that he was never admoniſhed nor ſuſpended; but all theſe evaſions will be too groſs to paſs for current with a juſt Judge. I hope 'tis no ſcandalous thing to bewail the want of, and earneſtly deſire a Diſcipline amongſt us, as guilty as the word is grown: By whom, or with what circumſtances managed, it matters not ſo much, ſo we might have the thing; that the plain and indiſpenſable Laws of Chriſt may be executed; that thoſe very Conſtitutions which are fundamental to ſuch a Society as Chriſt hath appointed his Church to be, may not be violated; that there may be diſcerned ſome difference betwixt the Church and the World, beſide what a bare Opinion, or verbal Profeſſion makes; that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the credible profeſſion and diſcovery of that faith and holineſs, which makes a man a Member of Chriſt, may ſerve for his being accepted as a Member of the Church. And I may very ſafely ſay, That all they who
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:54206:22"/>
have promiſed to God they would ſee to the removal of ſuch like corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as this I have been taxing, are indiſpenſably oblig'd to perform it, ſince this is no more than what was inclnded in their Baptiſmal Covenant, Whatever variety of apprehenſions there may be as to this point of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, yet methinks ſo much as is judged lawful and neceſſary, by thoſe who have power enough in their own hands, ſhould not be neglected: but it would very well deſerve their care, to ſee their own Laws put in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>
            <p n="10">10. And now we ſpeak of the Execution of Laws, we may very well mention it as a moſt ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d and ſhameful, and very provoking ſin, that after there is ſo much proviſion made for the reſtraint and puniſhment of Vice, by many good and wholſome Laws, there ſhould be no more fruit of them ſeen, for want of their being Executed. How rare is it now adays to hear of a man puniſhed for Drunkenneſſe, Swearing, Sabbath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>breaking? And is it any other than natural to ſee theſe and the like Impieties abound, whilſt the multitude that are moſt ruled by preſent things that reach their fleſh, find no hurt come of their moſt profane, and licentious courſes? And if men neglect their duty, can it be expected but that God ſhould take the Sword of Juſtice into his own hands, and puniſh the Rebellious? If it be demanded, what can be done more than to enact Laws, and appoint men to put them in force, and by a Solemn Oath engage them thereto? If it may n ot appear preſumption, I would anſwer, that it is alſo of as great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to ſee the Execution of Laws committed to them, who give pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable grounds to believe, that they will be faithful to their truſt. <hi>Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>begs</hi> Sword in a Cowards, or Childs hand, is like to do no great ſervice. The truth of it is, the moſt conſciencious look upon the charge as ſo weighty, that they dare ſcarce undertake it, much leſſe do they ambitiouſly ſeek after it; and if they ſhould, 'tis a queſtion whether their leſſe deſerving compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titors would not make a greater intereſt and prevent them. But were all who are concerned ſo vigilant as they ſhould be, no doubt but that there might be a very great redreſſe of this miſchief. Was there a diligent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection to diſcover, and a willingneſſe to embrace them, there might be found many, who notwithſtanding the great diſcouragements they might meet with, would for the Honour of God, and ſervice of their Country, engage themſelves in this burdenſom, but honourable employment. But can they be zealous for God, and for ſubjection to his Laws, who will not themſelves be rul'd thereby? Far be it from me to ſpeak evil of the Rulers of the People. I know it is the duty of all to do what they can to preſerve to their Perſons that Honour, which may contribute to the ſucceſſeful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of their functions. And therefore it is no way fit to charge them with crimes upon ſuſpition, or bare report; nor to reprove them for ſecret
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54206:22"/>
ſins publickly, nor to do it in that manner that may procure them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt from the People: But if the miſcarriages of men in authority are ſo notorious, that 'tis in vain to endeavour to conceal them; and when the offenders are ſuch and ſo many, that there is no way to deal with them, but by an open publiſhing of their reprehenſion; and conſequently of the faults they are reprov'd for; it cannot in this caſe be juſtly cenſured for irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence or undutifulneſſe, to mind them modeſtly of their duty, and their neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects of it: eſpecially whilſt the diſcourſe is general, medling with no mans perſon, nor reflecting on any but the guilty. Indeed it may very well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come thoſe who are more eſpecially concern'd, and who have the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of acceſſe to, intimacy with, and intereſt in Magiſtrates and great Ones, to deal with them, though with that ſubmiſſion and meekneſs which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeems Inferiours, yet with that freedome and plainneſſe which beſeems Friends, and Chriſtians. Such that have liberty to ſpeak, without gratify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the corrupt humour of the rabble, that oftentimes dearly love to hear their Governours talkt againſt and diſgrac'd; and they whoſe own perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal knowledge, furniſheth them with matter and ground for reproof, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking up with the flaunders, and groundleſs ſurmiſes of the malicious, or common rumours of idle, and impudent tatlers and railers; thoſe I ſay who have theſe advantages, are deeply engaged to improve the ſame in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their utmoſt to diſcover to them their particular ſins, with all the aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of them, and to preſſe them upon thoſe duties, which are ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for their own and the Kingdoms welfare. If this be the effect of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to be ſecured from all faithful, and ſerious reproofs, and councel, and to be betray'd by baſe flatterers, and fordid low-ſpirited temporizers; it is as great an unhappineſſe as can befall the Sons of men. To have leave to be ſick, and not told of it till its paſt remedy; to have leave to ſtab ones ſelf, and no one muſt dare to hold our hands, are no very deſirable privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges: And to be ſuffered to poſt on to everlaſting burnings, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing told plainly whither we are going, is I think, as little for our profit, as either of thoſe. If any be of another mind, as loth to be tormented before their time, I earneſtly pray God their experience give not them too full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction.</p>
            <p>That which I intend under this Head, is the negligence of thoſe who are entruſted with the adminiſtration of Juſtice. When I ſpeak moſt ſoftly, I cannot but ſay what is very notorious, that they are ſadly guilty of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivance at ſuch groſſe profaneneſſe, as is puniſhable by the Laws of the Land. Alas, they have got their diſtinct capacities; they are Gentlemen as well as Juſtices; and theſe it ſeems are inconſiſtent one with the other. That which Religion, their Oath, their fidelity to God, their Prince, and Country engage them to; is contradicted forſooth by the Gentility they
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:54206:23"/>
bear about them, which forbids all moroſeneſs and ſeverity, eſpecially to their companions, who are as deeply guilty of Debaucheries, as the vileſt and pooreſt Wretches of the Nation. And indeed can they with any Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, or pretence of Reaſon take notice of, or be ſevere againſt thoſe Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which their own Examples encourage even Inferiours, much more their Gentlemen-good-fellows to? Whether this be a Forgery or Slaunder, I appeal to the Experience of the reſpective Counties where they reſide. I intend not the Innocent in this accuſation; wherefore none but the Guilty have Reaſon to be angry, and they as little as any. Why ſhould an honeſt Citizen be diſpleas'd, to hear another ſay, <hi>There are many Knaves in the City?</hi> But if it be grievous to them to hear of their faults, their Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Swearing, and ſuch like Looſneſs, let them think what it is to commit them. How loudly did God cry, <hi>Who will riſe up for me againſt the evil doers?</hi> Or, <hi>Who will ſtand up for me againſt the workers of Iniquity?</hi> And becauſe none would hearken, <hi>God himſelf hath brought upon men their own iniquity, and cut them off in their wickedneſs,</hi> Pſal. 94. 16, 23. Had our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices, and all Magiſtrates, been as careful to prevent the Contagion of Sin in themſelves, their Families and Juriſdictions, as they are to hinder the ſpreading of the Infection, this latter Labour might happily have been ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them.</p>
            <p>And now I am ſpeaking of Rulers, and Men of Place and Honour, here give me leave ſadly to lament it, <hi>That the Nobility and Gentry of our Land, the Major part of them, are arrived to ſuch an height of Prophaneneſs, that they, as being by their Advancements more Conspicuous than others, are most Infamous for the ſeveral Vices we have mentioned.</hi> Oh where are the hop't for fruits of thoſe Sufferings many of them have paſt through? Do they not demean themſelves, as if they were delivered to do all theſe Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? Are they not too like that King <hi>Ahaz,</hi> who being afflicted, <hi>grew worſe and worſe?</hi> Have they taken ſuch a prejudice againſt the Word, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, that they hate the very thing too, and the leaſt appearance of it? What do they recoil with greater eagerneſs to their vicious courſes, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been under a reſtraint for a while? Are they reſolved not to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind hand in ſin for all that? Or do they think to revenge themſelves of God for the afflictions they have lain under? Or did they think themſelves now ſo ſecure, that without all danger they might provoke the moſt High God? Why, you poor impudent Worms, do you know whom you have reproached? Againſt whom you have exalted your voice, and lift up your eyes on high? even againſt the <hi>Holy One of Iſrael.</hi> Why, you Sotriſh Sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> did you think a title or place of Honour would diſpenſe with you, for your Rebellions againſt the Almighty Ruler of the World? Who hath ſtood by you, and obſerved all your contempt of Him, and his
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:54206:23"/>
Laws, and hath hitherto ſpared you out of Pity, not Fear. What, becauſe you could proudly inſult and domineer over your Fellow-creatures, did you think to Out-brave God himſelf? What, did you think a Feather in your Caps, or a Ruffling Suit, for which Fools look at you with ſo much Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, would procure his Reſpect? Did you think he would be more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of your Delicacies, than to Treat you ſo roughly, as he doth inferiour Sinners? Did you imagine, when he ſent his Meſſengers to ſeize you, when he ſhould Commiſſion either Death or the Devil to lay hold on you, that you ſhould fright them away with Swearing and Banning, and Damming? Or with your Swords and Piſtols, as you were wont to ſerve the Serjeants that came to Arreſt you? Did you imagine you had made an agreement with Death and Hell, that they ſhould never ſwallow you up? Or that your Submiſſions to the Devil had made him ſo much your Friend, that he would not hurt you? At length I beſeech you, be convinc<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>t of your miſtakes, and humbled for your folly; and be perſwaded to believe, <hi>That the ſtricteſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe is no diſhonour to your Greatneſſe, nor think that your Intereſt, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts it.</hi> Oh be not ſo monſtrouſly vile, to abuſe Gods bounty, ſo as to make it but an help to your ſinning againſt him with more freedom and conſtancy. Make not your Eſtates ſnares to your Souls, by miſpending them only in gratifying your Luſts, Appetite and Pride; but improve them for the Honour, and according to the intention of the Donor; that they may not become ſuch an accurſed portion to you, that at length you ſhould hear the cutting anſwer, given to one of your Predeceſſors, <hi>In thy Life-time thou didſt receive thy good things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor let any of our Great Ones pleaſe themſelves with a conceit, That they are not the Perſons eminently inſtrumental in bringing down Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon us, becauſe as yet they are freeſt from the ſame, as having the conveniencies of removing themſelves from that ſtroke which lights moſt upon the Meaner Sort; for we may frequently find in Scripture, That the ſins of the Great Ones have brought Sufferings upon the Commonalty, who alſo in their place and meaſure have been as wicked as others. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, let them not be too confident, till they are paſt all danger, till their Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is put of; or rather, till God hath laid down his Sword. If theſe Judgments reach them not, God hath yet more in ſtore for the obſtinate; and if they eſcape all here, yet if at length they are caſt into the Lake that burns with fire and brimſtone, they'l have little cauſe for boaſting. Since then our Great Men, like thoſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. 5. <hi>Though they have known the way of the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet have altogether broken the Yoke, and burſt the Bonds:</hi> My prayer is, that they may not do as thoſe, <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>Who when they were ſtricken, did not grieve, but refuſed to receive correction, and made their faces harder than a flint, and refuſed to return,</hi> leſt God execute on them thoſe threatnings you

may read at large, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. <hi>Oh that they may receive inſtruction in time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they feel that Iron Rod, which will daſh in pieces all it lights on, and comes too late to teach them any thing but what will aggravate their torment.</hi>

            <p n="11">11. I am verily perſwaded, had this Plague befal'n us Three or Fourſcore Years ago, and had Popery been as rife then, as now it is with us, this would not have been accounted one of the leaſt procuring cauſes, by the moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Divines of the Nation; except this be grown a more innocent thing than formerly, and the Idolatry of it diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>t away by latter wits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or elſe Idolatry be grown leſs offenſive to God, than heretofore; we may take the boldneſs to ſay, <hi>That the Licence its Profeſſors have had, or have taken to exerciſe the ſame, is one of the Abominations of our Land, provoking to a God jealous of his Worſhip.</hi> Reaſon of State, is an Abyſſe which it becomes not ſhort-ſighted Subjects to pry into; but if the pretence of this induce any thing contrary to the intereſt of Religion, he that hath imbib'd but the very principles of Chriſtianity, may confidently pronounce the deepeſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticians that adviſe it, <hi>Stark Fools.</hi> The reſolution and conſtancy of pious Prince <hi>Edward, England</hi>'s <hi>Joſiah,</hi> in denying Liberty for Maſs to his Siſter <hi>Mary,</hi> was in thoſe times accounted ſingular Piety, even by thoſe Biſhops who came to requeſt it. 'Tis ſomewhat ſtrange, methinks, to ſee even the poor Quakers themſelves, drag<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d to Priſons, and baniſh'd the Land; whil'ſt Conventicles more expreſly contrary to the Law of God, and equally, I think, to the Law of the Land, are (at leaſt) overlook't. Yea, let me add, this freedom they enjoy, whil'ſt half a dozen of private Chriſtians, in all things ſo far as concerns Laymen, conformable to the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> cannot have Liberty to meet together for the private Service of God; though it were but to join their prayers on the behalf of our Land, that it would pleaſe God to remove from off us <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>the heavy Judgments we now lie under. Could there be no proviſion made againſt Seditious Meetings, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch Reſtraints as theſe? Nay, and if they take this Liberty by ſtealth, how much more ſecure are twice as many Drunkards in a Tavern, met at one of their Conventicles of Good-fellowſhip? So that the more Politick, have found a Tavern the ſafeſt place for a Meeting. And doth not this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly evince, how much the humors and private inclinations of men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſway and prevail in their adminiſtrations by the ſame Laws? If therefore the ſpirit of the times, and the inclination of inferiour Magiſtrates lay as much againſt Prophaneneſs, as what they call Phanaticiſm; that would have no more immunity than this. Let none be offended at my Liberty of ſpeech, ſince doubtleſs theſe are things that need a Reformation; I hope 'tis allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſay ſo, yea, and neceſſary too.</p>
            <p>And as for Popery, though I involve not the Magiſtrate in the guilt of all that Liberty they aſſume to themſelves; yet I hope we may have free leave
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54206:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to lay guilt upon It, and to charge a moſt intolerable impudence upon the Profeſſors, and numerous Abettors of it. How many, both openly and cloſely, are hard at work for the propagation of that, which is much more hurtful, though not ſo ſpreading as the Contagion now amongſt us? And that it is not ſo ſpreading, we owe not ſo much to their want of will, or pains; but to the Goodneſs of God, the Illneſs of their Cauſe, and the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter temper of our Clime fortified with the Truth. But ſurely it would well deſerve the care of thoſe in power, to do ſomewhat more, to keep the Healthful from the Sick, and to order that there might not be ſo much Licenſe given for people to frequent thoſe places, where 'tis not impoſſible but ſome may be Infected; even ſuch, whoſe Senſe chooſeth their Religion; who would have their Devotion, like their Recreations; and a Chappel, like a Play-houſe: And I wiſh too many of our Gallants be not of this diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but as for others, I would have them go to a Maſs to be confirmed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Popery. It is very notorious, what freedom they take for their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in many places in the Countrey, as well as City, beſides thoſe that may be priviledged: And certainly <hi>England</hi> is not like to fare the better, for being the Stage whereon ſo much Pious Pageantry, and Hiſtorical Worſhip is acted. Had <hi>Dagon</hi> been carried about amongſt the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> with as much Reverence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the Ark was amongſt the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> with Rudeneſs; 'tis likely, That had been attended with as great Plagues, as was This. He that conſiders what Idolatry often brought upon the <hi>Jews;</hi> and ſhall well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template the Popiſh Devotions, and our preſent miſeries; may not more clearly diſcern our puniſhment like to theirs, than a like probable cauſe of it; and look upon us little more beholden to <hi>Rome,</hi> than they were to <hi>Baal Peor.</hi> If theſe meek Innocents (who with much ado bring themſelves to talk a little humbly, when inſtead of Fire and Faggot, they are forc't to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue with words) ſhould Retort, that we deal as unjuſtly with them, as the Heathens did with the Primitive Chriſtians, who imputed to them whatever miſchiefs befell the Empire. I ſhall be brought to think ſo too, if they can as eaſily evade the charge of worſhipping Angels, Saints, Bread, Altars, Crucifixes and Images; as thoſe firſt Chriſtians could free themſelves from the palpably falſe Objections made againſt them: but in the mean time I cannot be perſwaded, but that God is highly provok't with all thoſe mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eries of Worſhip which they have deviſed, and in the midſt of us, ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed. And even for theſe Inventions, may the Plague be broke in upon us.</p>

We may well account amongſt our provoking Sins, the ſad and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable Diviſions that have been, and ſtill are on foot amongſt us: And whoever have raiſed and kep't up theſe, have had not the leaſt influence to procure wrath upon us. Well may that People be divided from God,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:54206:25"/>
ſeparated from his love, who are ſo divided one amongſt another. When one part of the Nation hath ſuffered, then ſtill the other hath rejoyc'd in their Brethrens Miſeries, as contributing to the advancement of their Cauſe. And ſucceſſively, what the Sufferers call Tyranny, Cruelty, and Perſecution, thoſe that inflict it, call it a juſt puniſhment for their maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or obſtinacy. Oh how juſt is it then, That a general Puniſhment ſhould at length, work us into a more general Compaſſion? That at leaſt, we may pity each other, when we are all in the ſame Miſery, that appears to have nothing of a Party in it, but ſtrikes down on all ſides thoſe that ſtand before it? Many and great Factions in the Weſtern Church, did imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately precede its being over-run by the <hi>Gothes</hi> and <hi>Vandals:</hi> and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this, but all other Corruptions are we like to them, as may be learn'd from the Writers of thoſe days; God of his infinite mercy avert the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Judgments which ſuch Diſorders preſage. Such is, and long hath been our Caſe, That the loudeſt and moſt earneſt intreaties for Peace, have been drowned with the contrary noiſe and clamour of the Contentious. What comes from the weaker and oppreſſed Party, is ſtill rejected as mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring and complaining; And thoſe that are in Proſperity, reject the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers which after they would gladly condeſcend to. Still the Side that rules, when they find they can ſecure their Intereſts without any compliance, partly, out of a jealouſie of being undermined, partly, out of a love to to have the preheminence, and partly, out of a deſire of revenge, are far from hearkning to the moſt reaſonable motions for Unity and Peace. And he that mentions, or laments our Diviſions with never ſo Catholick and impartial a ſpirit and deſign, if he charge not all the blame upon one Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſhall ſcarce receive any thanks from either. If he cries out of nothing but Antichriſtianiſm, Idolatry, Superſtition, and Tyranny, then he ſhall be hugg'd by ſome; And if he inveigh bitterly againſt Schiſm, Sedition, Faction, Hypocriſie, and charge this upon all that are not juſt of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of the times they live in, then he ſhall pleaſe others. But if he ſay, ſome are too imperious and impoſing, and others too peeviſh, impatient, and quarrelſom; and both too guilty of cenſoriouſneſs and devotedneſs to their own cuſtoms or opinions; he ſhall hardly be grateful to either; but only to the true Sons of Peace amongſt all, who are endued with the ſweet and genuine temper of Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>Oh unhappy <hi>England!</hi> How long haſt thou been toſt to and fro by the hands of Violence and Contention? How oft haſt thou been bent this way, and that, into contrary extreams? Oh when at length wilt thou be ſet ſtrait, and obtain a quiet reſt? Oh that this might be the happy effect of Gods heavy hand now upon us! We, and our Poſterity then would have

cauſe to ſay, Oh happy Plague that befell us in 1665. which diſcovered to the Inhabitants of <hi>England</hi> this Plague of their own hearts, their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableneſs and animoſities one againſt another, and cur'd them hereof, and reconciled them into a bleſſed laſting Peace. To this Wiſh of mine, Let every Reader ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> even So beit.</p>
            <p>Oh what is become of that humble, patient, ſelf-denying, loving Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which was once the Character of the Followers and Friends of our gracious, tender-hearted, and compaſſionate Lord Jeſus. Strange, that ever the Goſpel of Peace ſhould furniſh the Corruptions of men with mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for Strife! When one great, yea, very great Deſign of it, is, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the trueſt, and moſt ſolid, and univerſal Peace amongſt the Sons of men: which is the natural Conſequent of their being at peace with God, through the great Reconciler. And yet what would we have? Theres ſcarce a man but ſpeaks for Peace, and vehemently declaims againſt Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Few there are but wonder there ſhould be any Differences in the World, and that men are not all of one mind. But what mind muſt that be? Even their own. And this, this is our miſchief: the World is full of ſuch Magiſterial Spirits, that they, forſooth, would be Dictatours in the Church. And though themſelves may be always wavering, and crookned by a Devotion for a Party; yet would they be the Centre where all vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous apprehenſions ſhould meet, their Opinions and Wills muſt be the Rule and Standard of Truth and Duty. Though men be never ſo much blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Prejudice or Self-conceit, yet they take it ill, if others will not ſee with their eyes, blindfold themſelves, and take them for our Guides. Now in our Nation; One man wonders what is in the mind of ſome, that they are faln ſo much in love with ſome inconſiderable things, that they rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly exact from all others an obſervance of them; And theſe wonder there ſhould be any found to ſcruple at them: But its well, if either remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber their own ignorance, weakneſs, and liableneſs to miſtake, which might move them both to a more charitable conſtruction of their Brethrens acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The Overtures for agreement, which come from the weaker, are ſometimes diſgrac'd by thoſe of their own way (the Zealots of them) as proceeding from Cowardice and temporizing, and moſt frequently ſnufft at by the Party that hath got the upper hand, as ſaucy and impertinent; The condeſcenſions of thoſe that are in power, are uſually little more than to will and command, yes it may be, entreat all that diſſent from them to a through-compliance, and then they'l account them humble and peaceable; but ſcarce otherwiſe, be their demands never ſo large and unreaſonable. And if any true Lover of Charity, not of the name, but thing, ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a way for the reconciling of differences, hee's look't awry at, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

by the higher ſide, and becomes leſs capable of Preferment (except as a means to corrupt him) as being not thorowly Baptized into their Party.</p>
            <p>Thus have we got one for <hi>Paul,</hi> and another for <hi>Apollo,</hi> nay, worſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing names than theſe; and whil'ſt both ſides are too guilty of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighing againſt each other for not coming over wholly to them, how little is done toward a Mid-way meeting? Who formerly have been, and who now eſpecially are too blame in the Land for keeping open our breaches, is not very difficult impartially to diſcover: But ſtill it ſo falls out, that they who are moſt in fault, may leaſt ſafely be told ſo; for this muſt needs be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, <hi>That they who have opportunity and power of making a very fair and ſatisfactory Accomodation betwixt thoſe that differ, and yet do it not; ſo far as this neglect comes to, are the perſons guilty of continuing our diviſions. They who had formerly this opportunity, and neglected it, were in their time guilty; and by conſequence they who now enjoy the ſame advantages, and yet improve them not, muſt needs fall under the ſame charge.</hi> I think that man undertakes a very hard task, whoſe confin'd affections, and zeal for his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Opinions, ſhall engage him to defend all that is done, by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers to the way which he himſelf hath embrac't: For my part I ſhould think it a piece of difficulty to maintain, that even our firſt Reformers from the Romiſh Superſtitions, were none of them acted by private Aims, and Secular Intereſt, or miſcarried in no circumſtance of managing Affairs, though the main cauſe was moſt juſt and honourable. Let who liſt then for me, enter into a defence of this ſide or that, not only for theſe Twenty, but Hundred and twenty Years; for ſo long a date do ſome of our unhappy differences bear: And many will confidently aver, <hi>That a Puritan is of as ancient standing, as an Engliſh Proteſtant, and was once thought beſt worthy of that Name; and that a Non-conformiſt was found, as ſoon as there appeared a Martyr for the Reformed Cauſe:</hi> Nor yet am I willing to look ſo far back, as to give any impertinent rehearſal of all the diſorders that did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede or cauſe, accompany, or immediately follow upon the more open and violent contentions which have been amongſt us, which might tend rather to exaſperate all, than profit any; for doubtleſs ſuch miſcarriages have been of all ſides (let particular Hiſtorians, this way or that, ſay what they will) that hearty Repentance, and mutual Forgiveneſs, is more becoming all, than Self-juſtification, and ſpleeniſh Recriminations; if there be any yet guilty of ſo much pride and uncharitableneſs. I heartily pray, that all who have ſo long ſurviv'd their Crimes, may be deeply humbled for their ſetting our Nation on flame (which all the blood that was ſpilt hath not yet quench't) for the Scandal they have brought upon the Proteſtant Cauſe, for all their breach of Oaths, Vows and Covenants, proſtituting their Conſciences, and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:54206:26"/>
pretending Religion for carrying on their corrupt deſigns, and wilful letting ſlip the opportunities they had, for the promoting the cauſe of Chriſt, and eſtabliſhing a ſetled Peace in the Churches; for the gaining of which, ſome excellent Spirits did ſo earneſtly (though too unſucceſsfully) labour. But oh is it not ſtrange and ſad, that after we have ſo long ſeen and ſmarted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the deplorable effects of diſcord, we ſhould yet be as far from embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ng the neceſſary means of Reconciliation as ever! That after a Civil Peace hath been graciouſly reſtored, the Church ſhould ſtill be ſo much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided? And this after diverſe moderate perſons of different perſwaſions, have ſo plainly laid down the methods for ſuch an agreement, as might have made us a Church glorious to all the World; yea, for thoſe things which are the true glory of a Church, which would have made us alſo happy in the approbation and favour of the God of Peace and Holineſs. The Lord open the eyes, and ſoften the hearts of all, at length to diſcern and accept of ſome ſuch Propoſals for Peace, that the Progreſs of our Feuds make us not a Spectacle of Pity to our Friends, and Laughter to our Adverſaries, as they have already made us Objects of Gods Indignation. It is not my buſineſs now to preſcribe theſe wayes, which if I were to do, I ſhould only take the boldneſs to preſent Tranſcriptions; and ſomething I may have occaſion to ſay of this under another Head, to which I haſten: Only in General let me add, This is a certain Truth, approved by the joint Suffrages of the moſt Sober and Judicious Divines, <hi>That whileſt our Peace is laid upon the practice and approbation of things in their own Nature, to the moſt Learned and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious, doubtful and disputable, it's never like to be firm and univerſal: And they who would build <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity upon an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity in thoſe matters which will never bear the ſtreſſe of it, ſuch as we before mentioned, they are the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that lay the ſureſt grounds imaginable for the hatching of Schiſms, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, though they who take this occaſion, may be alſo culpable, yet will not this excuſe thoſe who adminiſtred it. Wherefore 'tis not by Names or Numbers, or Power, you muſt make a judgment, when you ſeek for Schiſmaticks, no more than you would, if looking for Catholicks, enquire only who call'd themſelves ſo.</hi> To evince my Aſſertions, who that hath not loſt his common reaſon, or elſe is becom'n a Papiſt, but may diſcern, how impoſſible it is that ever a ſtable Concord in the Chriſtian world, ſhould be founded upon the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Univerſal Headſhip of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome?</hi> And 'tis not all their Councels and Fathers they can make ſuch falſe brags of, nor the diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiveneſs of this gangrene of their perſwaſion, nor the favour of ſo many Princes, nor the Harmony they would make us believe is amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, can excuſe them from the juſt imputation of being moſt notorious Schiſmaticks, an d Dividers of the Church, and a manifeſt Combination of Sectaries.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:54206:27"/>
               <hi>Once more let me add,</hi> All thoſe who have eſpouſed any private Intereſt or Party, which they are reſolved to proſecute and maintain at that rate, that no man ſhall have liberty to promote Chriſtianity it ſelf, except he will jointly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the advancement of that their deſign and way; are like to perpetuate our diſſentions, ſo long as either there are other men of corrupt minds, who have got a Faction contrary to theirs; or ſo long as there are to be found men of tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Catholick Spirits and Principles, that will ſerve the humors of no men, nor abet this or that Party, as diſtinct from all other pious, ſober, and peaceable Profeſſors of the Chriſtian Faith; but are reſolved to be of that Sect only, which in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s dayes was everywhere ſpoken againſt.</p>
            <p>I know there are many that are earneſt for Peace, oftentimes meaning no more by it, than a ſtricter Combination of all of their own Party, or ſome a little different, againſt one they account a Common Enemy: Thus no doubt the Romaniſt may be griev'd to conſider the ſtruglings in his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers own bowels, and may paſſionately exhort the ſeveral Contenders to an Unity, for the more effectual advancement of the Catholick Faction, and joint oppoſition of the Reformed Churches. But alas, what narrow-ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritedneſs is this! The Peace therefore I am exhorting to, and which it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeems all true Followers of the Prince of Peace to endeavour after, ſhould be built upon ſuch foundations, as may make it extend to, and be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive of all that agree in the Eſſentials of Religion, the belief and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of thoſe things that are revealed in Scripture, as neceſſary to Salvation; and they ought to keep up no other difference betwixt themſelves, and any that own the Chriſtian Name, and the Articles of its Faith, Papiſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves not excepted, beſides what the rejection of all Innovations in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, Diſcipline or Worſhip will unavoidably produce. And therefore to be ſo much of a Negative Religion, as Papiſts tell us we are, denying this or that groundleſs opinion, refuſing ſuch and ſuch needleſs practiſes, is a truer ſign of a Catholick, than impoſing any one of thoſe contraverted things. Our beſt Diſputants againſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> tell us, <hi>That the foundations of the Churches Eſſence agreed on, and conſented to, are alone the immutable grounds of its <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity.</hi> And I ſuppoſe it may be founded upon this reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> That when a man enters into any Society for ſome advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges there to be had, he is like to be firmly engaged thereto, whil'ſt the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his continuance in it, is an acknowledgment and practice of thoſe things only, that are neceſſary for every particular Member to do, if he would partake of thoſe benefits that are attainable in Common in that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety; for every mans perſonal intereſt engages him to an agreement thus far. But when any thing is ſuper-induct, that is, conſulted only for the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying or advancing ſome few, it cannot be expected that there ſhould be a
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:54206:27"/>
general compliance in theſe things. Now the Church being an Aggregate of perſons, believing and practiſing all things that God hath propoſed and enjoined, in order to their everlaſting Happineſs; what more can be thought neceſſary for their Union, than their Conjunction, in the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment and practice of theſe things? Good God! how clear, methinks, is this Truth! And if this be the way for an Union in the Catholick Church, why not in the particular Churches that are parts of it? For when theſe narrow and limit the conditions of Church-memberſhip, they ſo far de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from Catholick Unity. But theſe things are fully ſpoke to by others. So then, what miſcarriages we are guilty of in this particular, is fully evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; and what is to be done for their redreſs, is no way difficult to be found out and accompliſh't, if at length we were agreed to make Chriſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt ours, and wholly to lay out our ſelves, and improve our power, and enact Laws only to promote that, and to enforce the Laws he hath already made, and would but bring our acknowledgments of Scripture-ſufficiency into practice.</p>
            <p>The Lord grant this may be the reſolution and endeavour of all in this Church and State, who, under God, are in a capacity of reſtoring Health and Tranquility to a people ſo ſorely weakned, by their being crumbled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſo many Sects and Parties; that at length becoming one in Holineſs and Love, and turning as one man to the Lord, ſerving him in a pure Language with joint conſent, he may be one with us, and the unity of our prayers may help on to their Succeſs, even the removal of thoſe Judgments, that were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted to drive us to ſuch an Unity.</p>
            <p>That I may now, Laſtly, Sum up much in one word, <hi>We have been a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple guilty of as wilful and malicious contempt of God, his Goſpel, Miniſters and People, and neglect of all true Religion, as ever any Nation of the world was, that hath enjoyed the means and opportunities for, and lain under the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements to Reformation that we have done.</hi> How have we trampled our mercies in the dirt, or thrown them in the face of the Giver? How ſoon have we forgot his Rod, when when we have been but juſt from under the ſmart of it? How have we contemn'd the Threatnings of further wrath denounc't againſt us by his Word and Miniſters? How hath even profeſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm abounded, that hath made a ſcorn of, not only the Duties, but Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of Chriſtianity? To renounce all Religion, was to be taken for a Wit: And by their long impunity in wicked courſes, were men more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in their Atheiſtical conceits. Was it not fit then that Death ſhould reduce them to their right mind, when they are ſo wilfully diſtracted? But eſpecially for practical Atheiſts, who whil'ſt they profeſs to know God, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie him not as God, but in works deny and diſhonour him, how do they
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:54206:28"/>
abound in our Land! Except but ſome Formalities of external Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, and publick Worſhip, and a meer Opinion; How little ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance is there of a Church, or Chriſtianity amongſt us? Seem we not rather a Cage of unclean Birds? Look into the Court, and Univerſity, the City and Countrey, all ſorts and conditions of men; and ſay then, whether are we not overflowed with profaneneſs, which its juſt ſhould be followed with a deluge of wrath to waſh it away? to what a paſs are we come? amongſt whom nothing is ſo ſtrange as ſerious Holineſs and ſtrict Walking? To be a diligent Server of the moſt holy God, is made a matter of reproach? To live up in the Principles of that Religion, we all pretend to, is to expoſe ones ſelf at the leaſt, to ſcoffs and jears? All that is paſt jeſting in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is accounted Fancy and Hypocriſie. Serious Diſcourſe is but fantaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Canting. To mention any word of Chriſt or his Apoſtles, without making a jeſt of it, or the ſacred Name of God, except in an Oath, or to take it in vain, is an offence to many tender ears. To admoniſh and reprove a Drunkard or a Swearer, is to become a Buſie-body, and ſelf-conceited. To ſpeak of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or Chriſt, Death, Judgment, and Eternity, and the great Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, is the way to have ſome diſgraceful Title or other preſently put upon you. Godlineſs it ſelf is look't on but as a faction, and as ſuch deſpis'd and revil'd; and the moſt unblameable Profeſſors of it, ſtigmatized with ſuch names, as being deſign'd for their diſgrace, too plainly ſhew what is their fault, even Purity, and preciſe, circumſpect Walking. Now may we juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly revive the complaints made by godly Biſhops and Miniſters in former times, That let Men walk never ſo conformably to the Law of Church and State, only endeavouring to avoid the Sins of the times, and in their Place and Calling to bear witneſs againſt them, endeavouring to live con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing, exemplary Lives, and to promote Godlineſs in their own Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and amongſt their Neighbours, preſently they ſhall be called Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans (for that was, in <hi>Bolton</hi>'s phraſe, the honourable Nickname of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity in thoſe days) and conſequently, have leſs favour than ai Papiſt, or carnal Goſpeller. The moſt powerful and awakening Preaching, and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, affectionate Praying, where it is had to be had in publick; are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grac'd by the name of Popular things, and ſuch Miniſters the leſs favour'd, becauſe flock'd after. And here is the Fruit of the Afflictions that have ſo long lain on us, even for ſuch Sins as theſe!</p>
            <p>Oh how juſtly may God take up againſt us all, thoſe Complaints that we find in his Prophets, he doth againſt the <hi>Jews.</hi> He hath ſent his Meſſengers early and late, giving us Precept upon Precept, Line upon Line; cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to us, Oh do not theſe abominable things; they will be bitterneſs in the end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet we have turned the deaf ear. Nay, when we have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:54206:28"/>
to enquire of the Lord our Duty, yet when it hath been revealed to us, we have at leaſt in our Works, ſaid, We will not do all the Lord hath ſpoken, but we will walk after the ways of our own hearts; we will never live ſuch ſtrict and godly Lives; this is more ado than needs; there is no ſuch danger in following our Luſts; this is but the device of Preachers to terrifie us. It was well enough with us, when we lived in thoſe ſins they keep ſuch a ſtir againſt; and we had never good World, ſince ſo much Preaching and Godlineſs came up. How have we mock'd God by our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to ſerve him, when our hearts have been far from him? And thoſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Perſons, who in the Church were confeſſing their ſins, and praying, that they might live a godly and ſober life; when their Devotions are end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, will do little leſs than deride Godlineſs, and run into all exceſs of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot, and wonder at them as preciſe fools, who run not with them. And all this muſt be ſolved by crying, <hi>The Temple of the Lord, The Temple of the Lord;</hi> The Church, The Church; by being zealous of ſome Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or Cuſtom of little Concernment, and railing at all that are not of their humour, as diſobedient, factious, and phanatical. How is the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God dwindled to a meer Formality, and many underſtand no more by it, than a devout uſing ſome particular Form or Mode of Prayers, and by this they think to purchaſe Heaven ſure enough, and make amends for all their neglect of Perſonal and Family-duties, for the Earthlineſs of their hearts, for the Vitiouſneſs and Diſorder of their Lives? Oh how have Fools made a mock of ſin, and look't on it as a trifling thing, that men need to be ſo ſhy of. How many pretty Pleas and Excuſes have they got for Whoredom, Drunkenneſs, and the moſt monſtrous Pride? If the plaineſt Word of God contradict their Luſts, it ſhall be of no value with them: ſome trick or other they'l have to evade it; or, if they have nothing to ſay, yet they'l will ſet their wills againſt Gods Commands, and ſtatly diſobey them. Have not we even wiſh't there was never a Bible in the World, no God in Heaven; and lived as if indeed there was not? And alas, how ſmall a Remnant is there that have eſcaped the common Pollutions? How few that have been deeply affected with the diſhonours done to their Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father? Who have ſtood on the Lords ſide, and been faithful to the cauſe of Holineſs? Theſe have been but as the gleaning of the Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, as after the gathering of the Summer-fruits, here and there one in a Town; and theſe (even as the Remnant of the Faithful amongſt the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites)</hi> have been the wonder and ſcorn of the reſt. Theſe have been the Song of Drunkards; and they, together with that Word they walk by, have been the ſport of thoſe whoſe hearts have been merry, as <hi>Sampſon</hi> was to the <hi>Philiſtine</hi> Lords. They and their Scripture ſerve the profane
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:54206:29"/>
Gallant to ſhew his Wit, and help the Poet to Matter for his Play. Theſe for the moſt part are looked at as the moſt pernicious to the Places where they live. And upon them Malice hath its narroweſt eye. He that departs from Evil, makes himſelf a Prey; they have hated, and put to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence him that hath reproved in the Gate; and abhorred him that ſpake up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly; and, after all, wiped their mouths, and ſaid, Let the Lord be glorified. Were not we arriv'd to a moſt doleful ſtate, when the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act obedience to the Laws of God, was accounted leſs diſgraceful, than the moſt open violation of them; and few durſt plead for, and practiſe Holineſs with that confidence, that others durſt commit, and own known Sins? How hath God waited long, and made the Power of his Long-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering to appear, ſtriving with us in the ways of Love, and mingling Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections with his Mercies, that he might prevail with us to pity our ſelves, but all in vain? He puniſh'd us with the Sword, and kep't us long in the Furnace, and we are com'n out leſs refined; Again, he tried us with mercies, but we improved them not. He hath threatned, when he might have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, and born with us long to prevent our ruine, and yet nothing would work: But we have preſt him with our iniquities, and even made him to ſerve with our ſins; we have grieved his Spirit by our ſtubborneſs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion; and have began to think, becauſe he kept ſilence, he was ſuch one as we, and liked well enough of our ways; and becauſe his Judgments were not ſpeedily executed, our hearts have been fully ſet to do evil. And when we were come to this paſs, and God was even weary with withholding, and there were ſo few to ſtand in the gap to turn away his wrath, and even of them, many in a great meaſure thruſt out of it; Were we not ripe for deſtruction? Was not our Ephah full? Is it then any wonder, if at length, God be riſen to plead with us, in a manner that ſhall make us know and feel, that he ruleth in the World, who will by no means acquit the impenitent? who, though he bear long, yet will not always bear wit h a ſtiff-necked Generation? Could we expect any other, than that God ſhould make bare his Arm, and viſit us for theſe things, and eaſe himſelf of his Adverſaries, and avenge himſelf of ſuch obſtinate Contemners of his Laws and Authority? And what, <hi>Shall the Lion roar, and not the Beaſts of the Foreſt tremble!</hi> Is God angry, and ſhall not we fear? Doth he ſhake his Rod over us, nay, lay it upon us, ſo that Thouſands feel it in their fleſh, and all hear the ſound of its terrible laſhes; and yet do we not tremble? Shall not our haughty countenances change, and the joynts of our loins be looſed, now there is an Inviſible hand come forth, writing ſuch bitter things againſt us? Hath God ſuch a ſore Controverſie with us? Hath he done ſo much, and yet will he yet do theſe and theſe things againſt us, and wilt thou not yet prepare to meet thy God,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:54206:29"/>
Oh <hi>England?</hi> Oh the dreadful ſenſleſſneſſe and ſtupidity of the hearts of our People! How few are yet careful to learn Righteouſneſſe, by the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are amongſt us! Notwithſtanding this day of Adverſity, how few will be brought to Conſider? Is not this a direful preſage of farther Wrath? And that it is even an utter Deſtruction, that is coming upon us! Oh what a ſpirit of ſlumber and ſottiſhneſſe hath poſſeſt the moſt! If it is not ſo with thoſe about thee, Reader, thou dwelleſt in a happy place. Though people hear of Thouſands Dying about thee, and have daily rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to expect their turn ſhould be next, yet how regardleſſe do they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear of all due preparations for it as ever? They flatter themſelves with a conceit that yet they may eſcape, and that Death ſhall not come nigh their Dwellings, and ſo poſt off all thoughts of it, taken up with the very ſame buſineſſes, deſigns, and pleaſures, they were always wont.</p>
            <p>But what ſhould we ſay, can Sword, or Famine, or Plague, or any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Affliction work on them, who have been nothing bettered, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hardned by Commands, Promiſes and Threatings? Can the Rod plead with, and importune them, ſo as the Word hath done? Will Sickneſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, command, argue and beſeech ſo affectionately as the Miniſter was wont? Where <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets might not be heard, what can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail? <hi>If hewing them with the Prophets, and ſlaying them with the words of his mouth, would not affect them, Hoſ.</hi> 6. 5. Shall the Execution of his Judgments bring light? Why, yes no doubt, God hath his Chaſtiſements which ſetting on, and enforcing his Word, do often humble and reform Souls, and he hath alſo thoſe Puniſhments by which he Deſtroys. And if men will will ſtrive againſt his Spirit, and reſiſt it's workings; ſhut their eyes againſt the light, contemn Inſtruction, yea, harden themſelves under Correction; and rather hate the God who makes them ſmart, than the ſins that procure it, like thoſe in <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. who blaſphemed God when they were in anguiſh; what can be expected but the final ruine of the People or Perſons, that are guilty of ſuch Stubbornneſſe and Impenitency? And oh that this were not the caſe of multitudes amongſt us! The Lord awaken thoſe that are yet in a capacity, to a timely prevention of ſuch a doleful mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery. And thus I have given an account of thoſe Crying Sins, that are to be found amongſt us, which belong to the firſt Branch, which comprehended under it thoſe ſins, that were more evident and notorious. And by this we have made way for the Second; to diſcover ſome ſuch miſcarriages, which may be leſſe evident, but no leſſe hainous than theſe, as being indeed in a great meaſure productive of them; and therefore I thought it metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical enough to proceed from the ſenſible effects, to the ſomewhat more la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Cauſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:54206:30"/>
All that I ſhall ſpeak of the latter Branch, I ſhall reduce to this one Head<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> namely, That it may very juſtly be preſumed, to have a great Influence in the procuring our Miſeries that ſo many able Miniſters of Chriſt, have of late been ſilent, and in a manner uſeleſs, compared to what they might have been, had they continued their Publick Employments.</p>
            <p>Thus far I hope none will be offended; For if it be granted <hi>de facto,</hi> that there are many whom God had furniſhed with abilities to ſerve him in the Miniſtery, which he had called them to, that have not exerciſed thoſe abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to the beſt advantage in that Function, (and I think he muſt have a good ſtock of Impudence who ſhall deny that many of thoſe, who have been of late Unſerviceable, were ſo accompliſh't) then I ſhall eaſily evidence, that hereby God hath been much diſhonoured and provoked, whoſoever the fault hath been; which is that I ſhall briefly inquire into and diſcover, and then give in full evidence of my aſſertion.</p>
            <p>I know it may ſo happen, that what I write, may diſpleaſe one and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but for that I am indifferent, as having reſolved to give no allowance to my paſſion or prejudice; but to uſe the ſame impartiality and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, to the utmoſt of my power, that I ſhould do, if, ſo ſoon as ever I had finiſhed my work, I was to receive my ſummons to appear before the juſt Judge of Heaven and Earth. Nor would I willingly ſpeak any thing, but what the undoubted Intereſt of Chriſt and his Goſpel engage me to, and will warrant me in: And whilſt I have the Lord engaged in the whole cauſe which I undertake, and plead; I value not a ſtraw at my foot, what the moſt enraged potent malice can do. Nay, I dare then beſpeak all in the words of the King of <hi>Egypt</hi> to <hi>Joſiah,</hi> a little varied, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35. 21. What have I to do with thee, Oh man, whoever thou art? I come not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee this day, but againſt Sin, wherewith I have war; for God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me to this work. Forbear from medling with God, who is with me, that he Deſtroy thee not. And I think a man may with as much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort be a Martyr for the Unity and Peace of the Church, and advancement of Holineſſe, as ever any of our Proteſtants were, for the defence of the Reformed Religion (and indeed this was more their Cauſe than Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity it ſelf, if we conſider it right) yea, though he have a ſheet of paper pinn'd to his back, that ſhall call him Schiſmatical and Seditious, and as ſuch he be puniſhed; as they we know were burnt for Hereticks. But to the buſineſſe in hand. As to the matter of Fact its well enough known, what Conditions were required, of all that would continue in the Miniſtery, and ſtill are exacted, of all that will enter upon it, which Multitudes not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to, were Suſpended and Silenced, and others, who both by their Parents, and themſelves were deſigned for that Employment, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly

Educated, were prevented of their intentions. The ill effects here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I ſhall ſpeak ſomething to anon.</p>
            <p>Now that I may deal fairly and plainly, this I muſt needs ſay; That if there have been any of theſe Diſſenters, who were convinced in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, that the things commanded were ſuch, as all circumſtances conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered, they might lawfully have ſubmitted to; but yet out of faction, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, obſtinacy, a deſire to gratifie, or promote a party, or any ſuch car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal principle, did refuſe ſuch ſubmiſſion; they cannot be excuſed from the guilt of deſerting their charges, and of the many ill conſequences of that deſertion. What can any man in reaſon deſire more? For it is as ſuch they ſuffer, and not meerly as miſinformed, much leſſe ſure as invincibly ignorant, or as men that would not ſin; and if they have indeed been guilty of the Crimes, for which their Puniſhments are proportioned, I readily joyn with their moſt forward accuſers; but oh that the Puniſhment had ſtayed, till the Crime had been proved, and laid on thoſe only that were found guilty?</p>
            <p>But on the other hand, if there were any, who did uſe all probable means for their ſatisfaction, (being earneſtly deſirous to have continued in the work of the Lord) and after all remained perſwaded, that they could not comply with what was enjoyned them, without wilful ſinning againſt God; then they who by their Impoſitions did neceſſitate them to forſake their Miniſtry, are liable to the former charge, <hi>viz.</hi> are guilty of their Ejection, and of the Effects thereof; except they had ſufficient reaſon for ſo doing. Would they have any thing ſpoke more candidly and gently?</p>
            <p>Now whether there be any of the former ſort or not, I cannot, nor dare expreſly affirm; and I think, till they ſhall acknowledge, or ſome other way diſcover it; (more than I for my part have known them yet do) it can be known only to him from whom no ſecret thoughts are hid; but I deſire them to deal faithfully with their own hearts, and if they are conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to themſelves of any ſuch ill Principles, and grounds of their not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming to their Rulers Laws, to be humbled for, and expel them.</p>
            <p>That there are many ſuch ejected, and prevented from the Miniſtery, as I deſcribed in my latter Suppoſition, I cannot but believe, as having for my ſelf, the Teſtimony of my own Conſcience, in the ſight of God; and for others ſuch Profeſſions from men that have done nothing, that I know, to forfeit their credit; and ſuch Reaſons to make thoſe Profeſſions appear credible; that I am little leſs confident of it, then I am that there is ſuch a place as <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Paris,</hi> which I know only by hear-ſay: I ſay, little leſs confident of this, that there are many who yield not a Conformity to what was impoſed, not out of Hypocriſie or Humour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but out of a fear of diſpleaſing God, and hurting their own Souls.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:54206:31"/>
If this then be acknowledged, I think thoſe who have caſt and kept ſuch out, have very great cauſe to be humbled for their ſeverity toward them, according to the meaſure they were Inſtrumental herein: Except (I added) they had ſufficient reaſon for their ſo doing. And that I ſhall grant they had, if they manifeſt either of theſe two things; which are all the grounds I can imagine.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That there are as good effects of this their Ejection, as I can produce ill ones.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Or that the nature of thethings impoſed on them was ſuch, that it had been of as dreadful conſequence to have diſpenſt with conformity to them, as thus to deal with them for not rendring ſuch a Conformity.</p>
            <p>But till either of theſe be proved, or ſome other ſatisfactory reaſon aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned (giving leave ſoberly to debatethe caſe) I ſhall for the conviction, and humiliation of the guilty, mention a very few of the many ſad effects of this their excluſion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt is, the unreformedneſſe, and wickedneſſe of multitudes that through Gods bleſſing upon their endeavours, might have been converted and reformed. And that this might have been in all probability accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, we may very reaſonably argue, from that eminent ſucceſſe which God gave to many of their publick labours, and by ſome fruits, ſince then, of their private endeavours.</p>
            <p>Let none here willfully miſtake and ſay, that by Converting men, I mean nothing elſe but to turn them to a party, or an opinion: for I profeſſe I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend no ſuch thing; but the very ſame that Chriſt doth, when he tells us, that except we be Converted, we cannot enter into the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and that the Apoſtle doth, when he ſpeaks of our being <hi>turned from darkneſſe to light, and from the power of Satan to God:</hi> Even the turning the bent of mens hearts and lives, from ſin and the creature, to God by Jeſus Chriſt, and to the ways of Holineſſe, let them be of what opinion they will as to the ſeveral forms and modes amongſt us. Oh how many fewer Drunkards, Swearers, Whoremongers, Oppreſſors and Cheaters might there have been amongſt us; had they had their liberty to have preached down theſe ſins, whoſe only ſtudy and buſineſſe it was to decry and ſhame them, and bring men from the love and practice of them? How many more might there have been, who as true mourners in our <hi>Zion,</hi> would have been humbled for their own, and the Nations ſins, and laboured by all means to have prevented Gods wrath; had they in all places enjoyed thoſe means for their Converſion, which they ſometimes did, and might yet have done. If then the multitudes of provoking ſinners, and the ſcarcity of humble, holy, praying Chriſtians, have been any ground of our ſufferings, can it be
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:54206:31"/>
doubted whether that which hath been ſo much the cauſe of thoſe, hath done any thing to the procuring of theſe.</p>
            <p>Oh for the Lords ſake bethink your ſelves, all you that are concerned; Was it juſt and equal Dealing, when the Prince of Darkneſs was advanc'd with all his might into the Field, then to Disband, and put out of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion ſo many experienced Leaders, that in their own Perſons, and by encouraging and guiding the ſeveral Companies, would have done their beſt to reſiſt him? Did you herein conſult the pleaſure of the great Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of our Salvation, from whom you own your ſelves to have received your Offices, only for the ſucceſsful carrying on of his Deſigns, and the fighting of his Battels.</p>
            <p>Nay, and all this you have done, becauſe they ſubmitted not to ſome things, which you your ſelves call Indifferent, and which they believed, were contrary to the former Inſtructions they had received from their Lord and Maſter.</p>
            <p>Judge in your Conſciences, Do you think it is more acceptable to Chriſt, that the Souls of men, whom he thought worth his precious Hearts-blood, ſhould periſh, rather than ſome Ceremony or Injunction of yours be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted? Did he ever in his Actions or Doctrine manifeſt ſuch a contempt of Souls, and ſuch an eſteem for a Ceremony? Conſider his Life and Death, and read his Diſcourſes to the Phariſees, and then judge. Are Salvation and Damnation Indifferent things? And ſhall they be leſs regarded than ſuch? Oh how will you compenſate for the Diſſervice you have already done to the Goſpel? It is not all your Revenues can do it, though your Repentance and Reformation of ſuch miſcarriages for the future, may do much. Be not offended with my freedom of ſpeech: for (God is my Witneſs) I ſpeak not out of paſſion, nor a deſire to make you odious; but out of a juſt zeal for the Cauſe of our deareſt Lord, and the Concern of mens Immortal ſouls. What amends will you ever be able to make to the poor Creatures, who may now be tormented in Hell, for want of thoſe means of prevention, which you deprived them of? Though they may have had thoſe other advantages which may leave them inexcuſable before God; yet how will you excuſe the denying them the beſt you might have afforded?</p>
            <p>You may deride, ſtorm at, on contemn theſe expoftulations of a poor Worm like your ſelves: but conſider, I beſeech you, What anſwer you will make the great Judge of Heaven and Earth, who will come ſhortly in Glory and Power to plead his own and his Peoples Cauſe: when he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard no man for the pompous Titles he hath had, or great Offices he hath born in his Church (for then, well fare the Pope and his Clergy) but
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:54206:32"/>
they who have done and taught his Commands, let them be of never ſuch diminutive titles and eſteem here, ſhall be accounted Great in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. And That, That's our comfort, by his Word we ſhall be judged at laſt, if here we may not be tried by it. Then we ſhall all ſtand on equal terms, and the arbitrary determinations of frail men ſhall no more take place, but there abide an Inquiſition. To that Bar we appeal, by that judgment let us ſtand or fall; thither we refer our ſelves, and if we may not be heard here, we will patiently and chearfully wait that final, juſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of our Cauſe.</p>
            <p>But now hear, for your own ſakes at leaſt, if neither our beſeechings and tears, nor the cry and blood of ſouls may be regarded. Do you think this is a ſlight matter? And that you can eaſily ſhift it off, if they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired at your hands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Did Chriſt die for ſouls, &amp; ſhall they eſcape who mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them? And do they do any leſs, who hinder thoſe that would run to help and ſave them? If the ſilent Watchman be ſo damnably guilty, what are they that ſilence the Watchmen? To conclude, Whether it had not been more acceptable to God, more correſpondent to your Commiſſion, more beſeeming your Places and Profeſſion, more for the advancement of Religion, and the eternal Welfare of Souls; to have continued and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged faithful Labourers in the Vineyard of the Lord, whoſe only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light was, to be employed in his Service; rather than to have offered them ſuch terms, which Chriſt never bid you, and then exclude them for not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting thoſe terms, I think, your own Conſciences may eaſily determine now, be ſure the Lord of the Vineyard will, ſhortly.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another Effect of their removal from the Miniſtry, is, that many Places are left deſtitute, and many are ſupplied with negligent, inſufficient, ſcandalous men. Had their rooms been fill'd with others as learned, pious, and induſtrious as they; yet could they, who caſt them forth, hardly evade the former charge, except they could manifeſt, that the Harveſt was not great enough, to have required all their utmoſt conjunct diligence. But it is beyond all contradiction evident, That in many Places ſince their remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, there have been no Miniſters at all, in ſome as bad as none, in others worſe than none. Let none maliciouſly interpret my Accuſation largelier than I deſign it, which is not at all of the innocent. I cenſure no man as a Conformiſt; but reverence and eſteem all thoſe, who by their Lives and Doctrines, have apparently endeavoured to advance Religion; of which number, I am confident, there are many Conformable men. And I abhor that uncharitable, cenſorious Spirit, which condemns all that are not juſt of their own Way. But on the other ſide, I think all are engag'd to be as far from palliating the notorious miſcarriages of others. Oh how many
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:54206:32"/>
titular Miniſters have we got, that are far from deſerving the name of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians? That ſhould rather be turned out of the Church, than admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Pulpit? This is ſo manifeſt, <hi>That Sober men, though of their own way, acknowledge and lament it.</hi> How many are there, that more effectually preach for the Devil all the Week, than for God upon his Day? whoſe lives do more to ſet up Profaneneſs, than their Sermons to ſuppreſs it? Are there not many openly guilty of that Drunkenneſs, Wantonneſs, Swearing, and ſuch like Looſneſs, which they are appointed to turn others from? And are theſe wickedneſſes provoking in the People, and not in their Teachers, who can never be guilty alone? Are any men capable of offering ſuch an affront to God, and doing ſo much hurt to mens Souls by their wickedneſs, as they, from whoſe Lives ſhould be learn't what is acceptable to God, and neceſſary for us? 'Tis, I remember, the phraſe of an excellent Divine, <hi>A Profane Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, is the Devil in his Pontificalibus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I liſt not here to blaze abroad all the diſorders of our Clergy; I ſhall not inſiſt upon the ignorance and inſufficiency of any; though in point of Ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nour, they were concerned to have provided againſt ſuch, who did lately with ſo much earneſtneſs declaim againſt making Prieſts of the loweſt of the people. I will not meddle with that Tribe that lives by the Cathedrals. I will not tell of mens oblique Preaching, againſt that Holineſs which they pretend to Preach up. I ſhall not ſpeak of the Pride and Covetouſneſs, the Lazineſs and Negligence of Pluraliſts, Non-reſidents, and of all thoſe, who too apparently ſeek their own Honour and Profit, from the places they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon, rather then the Salvation of Souls. Theſe things I ſhall not dilate upon, becauſe I would not too much ſwell my Paper, and leſt I ſhould be thought to Rail: Only let me beg the Guilty to charge theſe Crimes home on their own Conſciences, as men that value their everlaſting happineſs; for doubtleſs God is much diſpleaſed with the ſins of thoſe, whoſe Callings hath ſo near a relation to him; and eſpecially with the moſt heinous ſin, of making Religion only as a ſtirrup, by it to get up into Dignities and Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; which they who could ſee and cenſure in others, ſhould be careful themſelves to avoid. But thoſe I mainly intend, are the groſly vicious, and debauch't, who are moſt unworthy to take Gods Name into thier mouths, to declare his Covenants or Statutes, who themſelves hate to be Reformed. Good Lord! That ever it ſhould come to this in a Chriſtian Church, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed from the Corruptions that had overſpread <hi>Chriſtendom;</hi> that infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly looſe and diſſolute men ſhould be Ordained into, and continued in the Miniſtry; when godly, ſober men are excluded, and kept out! Oh how might the Romaniſt inſult for ſuch an acknowledgment, if the Pope and his Cardinals, with the reſt of their Hierarchy, were not known all the world
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:54206:33"/>
over? But with us, ſuch doings are capable of far greater aggravations, than with them: Oh that I could ſpeak ſo ſharply, as might diſpleaſe our Church-governours into a Reformation of this Corruption. What, are Wolves fitteſt to be Shepherds of the flocks? Can the Devils Vaſſals deſtroy his Kingdom? Muſt ſtark mad men be made Phyſitians, and ſent to recover other men to their wits? Muſt they that have the Plague-ſores running up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, be ſent amongſt others to prevent their Infection? Is not a Peſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe a fitter place for ſuch a man, than a Pulpit? Are Traytors and Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaries, the fitteſt men to reclaim others from their Rebellion? Are they likely to honour God, and the Goſpel, and ſave mens Souls, who do as it were, by their actions ſay, <hi>Come, Pariſhioners, follow me; whatever I jeſt to you in the Church, about God and Chriſt, Heaven and Hell; theſe are but idle Dreams, or ſuch matters as you need not much regard, God is an hard Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, his Laws are too ſtrict; it's best to take our Pleaſures, and ſatisfie our Luſts, come on it what will; you entered into too ſtrict a Covenant in Baptiſm, you had better ſerve the Devil, than this Jeſus Chriſt, who layes ſuch hard things on his Followers; what need you regard his blood, he ſhed it, that you might have leave to live wickedly; or however, 'tis of no great worth; for you had better be in an Ale-houſe, or Whore-houſe, than the Heaven he hath purchas't.</hi> Are not theſe, think you, ſweet Preachers of the Goſpel? And let them conſider then how well they have diſcharged their truſt, who ſet them up, and maintain them, whil'ſt they ſhut forth thoſe who would make it their whole buſineſs, to carry on the very ſame deſign which Chriſt came into the world for. If any ſhould here object, and ſay, <hi>But theſe profane men are peaceable, whil'ſt your Godly ones are turbulent and diſobedient?</hi> I ſhall wiſh him to ſtay till I come preſently to ſpeak a word or two to that; only here let me anſwer, <hi>It ſeems ſtrange to me, that thoſe men muſt paſs for peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and obedient, who are known Rebels againſt the Laws of Chriſt; when they must be accounted diſobedient, who had rather loſe their lives, than wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly break one of the leaſt of theſe his Commands, only becauſe they ſubmit not to Humane Impoſitions; which yet they would do, did they not think themſelves pre-obliged by the Laws of Chriſt to the contrary.</hi> Is this fair dealing? I put it to thy own Conſcience, Reader, be thou who thou wilt, and as partial as thou wilt. And if I went no farther, I ſuppoſe I have ſpoke enough to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that there have been ſuch ſad conſequences of the ejection of all who Conformed not, that doubtleſs God hath hereby been diſhonoured<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and diſpleaſed, and for this hath a controverſie with our Land.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I might moreover add, the feuds and animoſities which have hereby been fomented and heightned, and are like to be ſtill perpetuated; whereas, had there been ſuch an abatement of things required, as might well have
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:54206:33"/>
been granted, in order to the retaining them in their places; this might have been an happy mean for the compoſure of our greateſt differences; and people could not have taken notice of ſuch diviſions amongſt us, nor could Papiſts have had ſo much reaſon to hit us in the teeth with them; nor could they whoſe ſpirits were too much exaſperated, or judgments corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, have had ſo much occaſion to make Factions and Parties, and ſo much ſin had been prevented.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Nor yet think it nothing, that ſo many innocent men and their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, are expoſed to ſuch great neceſſities, that ſome of them have ſcarce had bread and water to keep them alive; and ſome have been glad to betake themſelves to hard Labour, to procure them a Livelihood. Certainly, the very cryes of their Children for bread, ſounding in the ears of a moſt juſt and merciful God, are not diſregarded: And whether they who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc't them to theſe exigencies, have obſerved the great Rule, not only of Chriſtianity, but even Nature it ſelf, <hi>To do as they would be done to,</hi> I would wiſh them well to conſider. If any ſhould Retort, <hi>That they themſelves were once ſo dealt with.</hi> I anſwer, <hi>I think they were uſed nothing near ſo harſhly:</hi> But grant they were, the greater was their Injuſtice which was the cauſe; and the more inexcuſable they, who inflict on others the hard mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, which they themſelves lately groaned under; and make them their pattern, whom they complain of and condemn. And had it been (as it was not) thoſe perſons who injured them, whom now they cauſe to ſuffer, I wonder where Revenge is made their duty; but this in a Church-man, muſt ſometimes paſs for zeal for the Church.</p>
            <p>It was eaſie to inſtance in more effects of this their Ejection, which have been injurious to Religion, and the Souls of men. Hence it's come to paſs, that their endeavours in a private way, by perſonal diſcourſes, or writings, to reclaim ſinners, are much fruſtrated; for they are looked upon as a kind of diſtinct Party, and ſo let them be never ſo careful to inſiſt only on the moſt uncontroverted Truths of Religion, yet will many through prejudice miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtand all they ſay, as if they were pleading their own cauſe, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to gain Proſelytes to themſelves, whil'ſt they are only ſtriving to win Souls to Chriſt. When they are preſſing men upon holineſs and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence for their Salvation, ſome are prone to flatter themſelves with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, That this only is their ſtrict and ſingular Opinion; and all that they ſay or do in Religion, is put upon the ſcore of a Party, as if in theſe things they differed from others, and therefore are they diſregarded. And thus it is alſo as to the People, who are known to love and adhere to them; for their exact walking is look't on but as the following a Sect, and which need not therefore be imitated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And it can hardly be thought how many Souls
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:54206:34"/>
miſcarry through theſe miſtakes, which might have been much prevented, by that concord and mutual Love which might have made all have been eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as Brethren. Moreover, hence it is, that theſe being now counted diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected and diſcontented perſons, many who bore them a Spleen (for their Love 'tis not impoſſible) meet with pretences to vent it; for they narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly watch them in all their wayes (and a little Love to the Commonwealth, with a Doſe of Revenge and Malice, how vigilant will it make men?) and are ſtill ready to accuſe them of ſomething or other, they know not what, to bring them into trouble. And if they do but with all peaceableneſs meet together with their Neighbours and Friends, to quicken, comfort, and build up one another in their moſt holy Faith; yea, if they do but continue thoſe Meetings they were wont to have in times of greateſt Liberty; preſently they are liable to diſturbance and puniſhment, as men holding unlawful Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies; whereas, had no ſuch terms been put upon them, as neceſſarily put a difference betwixt them and others; they might have been eſteemed as Loyal Subjects, as they indeed are, and their actions had not been ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to groundleſs cenſures and accuſations, nor they ever hurried to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or forc't ſome other way to ſuffer, for nothing but the meer Surmiſes of the malicious. But I ſhall not give in more particulars: And whether theſe things I have mentioned are well-pleaſing to God, or whether they may not rather have help't on his Indignation againſt us, let all that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byas't determine.</p>
            <p>As to the Truth of what I have ſpoke, I think it cannot be gain-ſayed; and what can be anſwered, I cannot deviſe, except what I before hinted, any ſhould ſay, <hi>That by their removal, the Peace of Church and State is ſecured, which otherwiſe had been hazarded.</hi> To which I anſwer:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Might not this Peace have been procured better, by laying it upon thoſe things whereon Chriſt hath laid the peace of his Church? And not to make new Laws, to which whil'ſt men in Conſcience cannot give obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, they muſt be judged obſtinate, as the Courtiers ſerved <hi>Daniel:</hi> Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this is hard meaſure, when the things required are, in the judgment of the Impoſers, not neceſſary till they have commanded them, and ſo might have been left as indifferent, as they are in their own natures, and then how little contention had there been about them?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Might theſe perſons be excuſed from thoſe kind of Subſcriptions and Declarations which are commanded them, They are ready to give in all that Security, that can in reaſon he demanded, <hi>That they will be careful to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and promote the Publick Peace.</hi> If their Oaths and Promiſes may not be thought ſufficient to oblige them to this, what hold could be taken of thoſe other Subſcriptions and Profeſſions? But if theſe were intended as
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:54206:34"/>
a diſtinguiſhing <hi>Shibboleth,</hi> that they might know whom to fall upon; as a partition wall, to keep off thoſe that may in ſome punctilio's differ from them; as a Teſt of a Party, which ſerves to rank men under ſeveral diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. If any in their Impoſitions had ſuch like deſigns as theſe, it is not all their Power and Policy combin'd, that can make ſuch actings paſs for cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, with that God who is a Lover of Peace. And all at length ſhall be convinc't, <hi>That they who break the Peace of the Church, to promote the peace of a Party, are not thoſe Peace-makers upon whom a bleſſing is pronounced.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. I would fain know what diſturbance of the Peace there was, whil'ſt the Liberty granted by His MAJESTIES Declaration was enjoyed; and upon what account it was likely to have been more violated, had that Liberty been ſecured and perpetuated.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I am yet to learn how this Reſtraint that is laid upon them, doth any whit the more incapacitate them for interruption of the Peace, if a ſenſe of their duty laid not a ſtronger obligation on them. It's evident enough, that many of them have that influence upon their people, that it was no way difficult for them, to lead them into Sects and Separations, if they had a mind to't; and to lay ſuch provoking preſſures upon them, was not the way to prevent ſuch miſcarriages. But, bleſſed be God! their patience and moderation hath prevail'd over the ſmarting ſenſe of thoſe Sufferings, which might have vex't them into extreams. If any have diſcovered too much impatience and bitterneſs of ſpirit, as I excuſe it not, ſo neither are thoſe proceedings which caus'd it, any more juſtifiable: But for many, it hath been their care, according to their capacities, to heal the diſtempers of their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſpirits, to remove the too great prejudices many have conceived, and to reduce all whom they perceived inclined to a Party: So that I dare confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſay, <hi>They have done more to preſerve the Peace of the Church, than thoſe who Cenſure them, and caſt them out of the Miniſtry, as Factious, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>npeaceable. And as for raiſing any Seditions or Commotions in the State, not their moſt quick-ſighted Adverſaries have, that I can hear or know, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered them in the leaſt guilty. And did His MAJESTY but over-hear or know their daily privat'ſt prayers to God on His behalf, I am confident He would eaſily be convinc't, That His Kingdom holds not more Loyal, Faithful Subjects, than they, however they may be miſrepreſented, as deſerving all that Severity with which they are Treated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this time, I hope, I may on good grounds conclude, That the laying ſuch Reſtraints on ſo many faithful Miniſters, who might have been ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently ſerviceable to their Maſter, is one of thoſe provocations of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty, under the effects whereof we groan; and that therefore thoſe who have been the Procurers hereof, ought to lament their ſin, and do their
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:54206:35"/>
utmoſt to redreſs this grievance, and reſtore that Liberty of which their Brethren have been deprived. And if, when His MAJESTY, out of His Gracious Nature, was inclined to have given that Indulgence, which tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tender Conſciences did ſtrongly hope for, and which would have rejoyc't the hearts of ſo many Thouſands of His beſt Subjects; if then there were any who ſtood in the gap to prevent the ſame, as we were publickly told (in thoſe very words) there were; let all ſuch now ſoberly conſider, what a breach they have help't to make upon us, and by their interceſſion with His MAJESTY, for that Liberty He is ſo willing to grant, as by one ſingular means, let them now ſtand in the gap, and turn away God's overflowing wrath, that we be not utterly conſumed.</p>
            <p>And to you, <hi>Reverend Fathers,</hi> the Rulers and Guides of our Church, give me leave to re-inforce my earneſt Requeſt, in the Name of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Saviour, That as you value his blood, and the purchaſe of it, and the precious Souls for whom it was ſhed, you would yield a gracious audience to thoſe, who beg of you nothing but a freedom to publiſh the glad tydings of Salvation by Chriſt our Redeemer, to the loſt Sons of men. Conſider what a reaſonable thing it is that is beg'd of you, no Honours or Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but a Liberty to ſerve your Lord and ours in the work of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry. Look over, I beſeech you, your Commiſſion again and again, and ſee where you are commanded, yea, or allowed to caſt out thoſe whom God hath call'd to this work; or keep out thoſe, whom he hath in ſome meaſure fitted for, and ſtrongly inclined to it, upon ſuch grounds, and for ſuch rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as we are thus dealt with. Will you thruſt and keep ſuch Labourers out of the Harveſt, whom our Lord hath bid us pray might be ſent forth into it? Was your power given you to any other purpoſe, than Edification? Oh Sirs, what is it you ſeek? Is it indeed to advance Chriſts intereſt, to ſave poor Souls from the devouring flames? to ſet up Holineſs, and root out Wickedneſs? Why then will you remain at diſtance from your Brethren, whoſe very hearts are ſet upon theſe works; who had rather than all the Riches and Honors in the world, be more in a capacity of employing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſucceſsfully herein? Oh, why will you reſtrain them from ſpeaking, whoſe very bowels yearn over poor ſinners that are juſt dropping into the burning Lake, and think not where they are? When the faces of ſo many thouſands gather blackneſs, and they ſtarve and ſwoon, and fall in the ſtreets, why do you bind the hands of thoſe who would ſo fain reach them forth the bread of Life? When their miſeries and neceſſities cry aloud for help, why do you hinder thoſe who would gladly afford them a ſeaſonable Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply? Who, though they may employ themſelves according to their oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities with particular mens Souls, yet what's that to the having their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:54206:35"/>
to ſpeak to? Review your patterns, I beſeech you, and ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you find any carriages of theirs, in their ruling of the Church, which may juſtifie yours. Our bleſſed Lord would not have thoſe forbid to do Miracles in his Name, who went not with him. Nor doth <hi>Paul</hi> intimate any deſire to have ſilenc't thoſe who preach't Chriſt out of envy, much leſs ſuch (had there been any Paſtors of that mind) who were for eating of Herbs only, not meat. He ſpeaks indeed of having the mouths of ſome ſtop't, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>viz.</hi> They of the Circumciſion, who would have obtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded their Moſaick Ceremonies upon the Chriſtians, and judge whether our cauſe be like theirs; and yet even their mouths were to be ſtop't by ſound doctrine, and evidence of argument, <hi>ver.</hi> 8.</p>
            <p>Oh how confident ſhould I be of obtaining that Liberty I am begging of you (if Reaſons of another ſort hindred not) was Chriſt himſelf alive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, or any of his Apoſtles our Governours. Had I had the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to have lived in <hi>St. Pauls</hi> dayes, and addreſt my ſelf to him with all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and earneſtneſs, imploring a leave to preach the Goſpel, profeſſing I had no carnal aim in it, but that my Soul long'd to be diſcloſing thoſe myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and treaſures of Love to poor ſenſleſs creatures, that were paſſing on to damnation, as not knowing or conſidering what Chriſt had done to keep them thence, and that I would endeavour faithfully to declare the whole Counſel of the Lord, without adding to, or diminiſhing ought from it; had I made ſuch an addreſs, do you think in your own Conſciences, he would have turned me away without my Errand? I have ſometimes thought, that ſhould I have put up ſuch a Petition to the King, I ſhould have prevailed; but fears of becoming ridiculous, have deter'd me.</p>
            <p>But let not this my Sute, I beſeech you, be rejected; for what pretence of Reaſon can be alledged againſt it. It is not I know the things themſelves which are required, that you ſo much ſtand upon, as if they were in their own Nature neceſſary antecedently to your commands. And was ever yet any anſwer given to thoſe demands which have been made (amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) by a perſon of that judgment and moderation, that you can neither ſuſpect him of prejudice or inclination to a Party, when he asks what Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt hath given the Church to bind men up to more than himſelf hath done? What grounds there are why Chriſtians ſhould not ſtand upon the ſame terms now, which they did in the time of Chriſt and his Apoſtles? and whether Chriſt will ever thank men at the great day, for keeping ſuch out from communion with his Church (we may well add from their ſervice of the Church) whom he will receive into Heaven, and vouchſafe not only Crowns of Glory to, but <hi>Aureolae</hi> too, if there be any ſuch things there? He tells you there, that the Commiſſion the Apoſtles were ſent out with,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:54206:36"/>
was only to teach what Chriſt had commanded, not the leaſt intimation gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of a power to impoſe any thing elſe, except what they might be direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to by the immediate guidance of the Spirit of God; and that they made an antecedent neceſſity, either abſolute, or for the preſent ſtate, the only ground of impoſing their commands, and much more to the ſame purpoſe; which, however they are regarded, may ſhew thus much, <hi>That it is not only Humour and Singularity which judges it moſt reaſonable, that thoſe things, which the Defenders of them count Indifferencies, ſhould not be rigorouſly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on others, nor the Peace of the Church ſuſpenaed upon them.</hi> But is it indeed the Publick Peace that by theſe things you conſult for? Why will you then in the room of a Submiſſion to them, accept of any the moſt So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Engagements from thoſe who will enter into them, that they will not diſturb the Peace either of Church or State? And if you find any acting contrarily, proceed againſt them as you pleaſe. Let the World judge what reaſonable offers we make. Is it our obedience to Authority you would have us manifeſt? Why let our Submiſſion in all other things ſpeak for us. Or lay on us what commands you will in Civil things, or in any thing that may be no ſnare to our Conſciences, and by them prove whether we be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate or not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In a word,</hi> Will you accept our Promiſes, Bonds, Oaths, or what aſſurance can be deſired, That we will labour in all things to act moſt agreeably to the Gospel of our Lord, which we all own as a ſufficient Rule? And that we will not allow our ſelves in any prejudice, humour or perverſneſs, but in all things, (though we would not be made one a Rule to another, in matters that will well allow diverſity) will comply with you, ſo far as poſſibly we can, without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of displeaſing God, and damning of our own Souls? <hi>And ſurely you have more tenderneſs than to deſire us to do ſuch things.</hi> I am bold thus to speak in others names (though not one be privy to my Work) becauſe I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded there are few but will do thus much, and what can in reaſon be required more of any?</p>
            <p>Let none uſurp the Prerogative of ſearching hearts, and knowing mens meanings better than themſelves, and ſay, <hi>Theſe are fine words, and ſpecious pretences, but the deſign of all is, but to get more Liberty to ſtrengthen a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi> For I ſolemnly profeſs, and Thou God, who ſtandeſt over me whil'ſt I am writing theſe words, know'ſt it, <hi>I abhor ſuch a deſign.</hi> If to raiſe men to the knowledge and love of God through the Spirit of his Son; if to bring them to a careful obſervance of the precepts of our Lord, that they may be obedient to their Governours Eccleſiaſtical and Civil; juſt and charitable to their Brethren; that they may be holy, humble, heavenly, patient, meek, pure, chaſte and temperate; abounding in all the graces and fruits of the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:54206:36"/>
Spirit; If this be to make men a Party; then let me be interpreted as ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſirous to promote it; otherwiſe not. And ſhall thoſe, who have no other aims than theſe, be kept out of the Miniſtry, as turbulent, facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and ſchiſmatical? Yea, ſome that were not Born ſo ſoon as our Civil Confuſions, and therefore Sided with none, Offended none? If you indeed thought there were any thus innocent, and whoſe intentions were ſo up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, would you have no regard to them, but reject all their Petitions, even ſuch as I have made? Surely you would not. Why be aſſured, if there may any faith be given to men, and if it be poſſible for men to know their own hearts, there are ſome, yea, I am confident, many Such. Well, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever after all we may be cenſured and ſlandered, yet, whileſt we can daily betake our ſelves to the All-knowing God, and profeſs before him; that it is the grief of our ſouls, that we are deprived of thoſe opportunities of ſerving him, which we once had or hoped for, which we beg may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd and vouchſaf't rather than any outward advantages whatever; and that we had rather ſerve him in the Miniſtry, than (for any intereſt of our own) be made Monarchs of the World, onely we dare not pretend his Glory to juſtifie our lie; we dare not (for to him we may ſpeak plainly) ſay, we conſent to thoſe things we cannot find warrant for from his Word; nor that thoſe who have vowed to reform his Church, are not oblig'd by thoſe Vows, when corruptions are ſo many and great; but we beſeech him to lead us into all Truth, and diſcover to us our duty, for that he knows we would do any thing but Sin againſt him, to purchaſe a liberty publickly to Serve him; and therefore to his righteous judgment we wholly commit our Cauſe; whilſt I ſay in our daily prayers to God, we can make ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions as theſe (and that ſome can) we may poſſeſs our ſouls in patience, and be comforted with the Conſcience of our Integrity, whatever clamours there are without us, and whatever calumnies men may labour to faſten upon us. And I beſeech you, who by your harſhneſs, ſend ſuch daily to God with tears and groans under the heavy preſſures; yea, and Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands more of the beſt Chriſtians in the Land on their behalf, and on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of their own ſouls, in ſo great a meaſure deprived of the precious quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning means they once enjoyed; bethink your ſelves how grateful thoſe your proceedings are to God, which thus occaſion the juſt ſorrows and complaints of his Miniſters and deareſt People.</p>
            <p>And let me further put it to your Conſcience:, whether in your private Addreſſes to God, you can ſay, that you are griev'd in heart for your Brethren deprived of their Liberties, and that you have condeſcended to them as far as poſſibly you could without ſinning, and that you would do all that in you lies for their reſtauration, that might not provoke him, and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:54206:37"/>
be a burthen to your own Conſciences; and that it is the intereſt of Chriſt, and the Edification and Salvation of Souls which you aimed at, in your proceedings againſt them. Can you make ſuch Profeſſions as theſe to God? Or to men, as you will anſwer it at the great and dreadful day of accounts? I leave it to your calm and ſober Conſiderations.</p>
            <p>I ſhall no longer ſtand to importune you; but (as hoping I have not been ſpeaking all this while to the wind) entreat you to take into your ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious review, the Petition for Peace, preſented to you by the Divines ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by His Majeſty, to treat with you about Church-affairs. There may you ſee what their Requeſts are, and the preſſing Reaſons with which they enforce them: Requeſts ſo reaſonable, That, nothing but Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience could have convinced me, they were deniable; Reaſons ſo evident, that I am perſwaded they are unanſwerable: And in this perſwaſion I am more confirm'd from their being railed at, and ſcribled againſt (which was all the anſwer I ever heard of) by a Gentleman, from whom, if my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Paper can eſcape a ſuppreſſing, it fears not an Anſwer: for his violence is much more to be dreaded than his Reaſon. Now ſleight not, I beg you, theſe entreaties, becauſe you can eaſily deny them: for the cauſe I plead is juſt and equal, and of weighty moment, which I refer to your impartial debates, and leave the event to the diſpoſure of that God, for whoſe Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour it was (if I know my ſelf) that I undertook this plea. And him I ſhall humbly follow with my Prayers, That this Supplication, which I am writing <hi>Auguſt</hi> 24. may through his good Providence, and the favour of Authority, do ſomething to the reverſing of the Act, whoſe being in force, took date from This day three years ſince) This fatal Day that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be wrote in Black Letters in <hi>England</hi>'s Calendar.</p>
            <p>Grant this Oh my God, for thy Son Chriſt Jeſus ſake, I beſeech thee, and let all that ſeek thy Glory, and the Proſperity of thy Church, ſay, <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any upon the reading of this, ſhould argue me, either of too great confidence in making ſuch an attempt, or want of judgment to conceive there was any probability of the ſucceſs, when much more likely endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours have been uneffectual; Let ſuch know, That when I had deſigned to do my utmoſt towards a diſcovery of thoſe Sins, which have provoked Gods anger againſt us; I ſhould have thought my ſelf unfaithful to the Cauſe I undertook, had any fear or pretence of Reaſon prevailed with me, to paſs ſilently over a miſcarriage of ſuch a nature, as I have manifeſted this to be, ſo fruitful of, and complicate with, many others. And if any thing unequal to be framed by a Law, I hope that alters not the nature of it ſo far, as to make it above a Subject to call things by their own names. Had an Act paſs'd for the toleration of Drunkenneſs, or any the like Sin,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:54206:37"/>
I ſhould have taken the boldneſs to repreſent the ill nature and conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of it. And though it is not impoſſible but prejudice may ſpy out very great faults, yet, I hope, both as to the matter and manner of Diſcourſe, I have not tranſgreſs't the bounds of ſobriety, modeſty, nor that duty which I owe my Superiours.</p>
            <p>Moreover, I conceived, That now God calls us all to ſearch our hearts, and review our ways; they who themſelves put us upon this work, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort us to Repentance and Prayer, will not be unwilling to reflect upon themſelves and their own actions, as remembring they are men ſubject to the ſame miſtakes and frailties that the reſt of the ſons of lapſt <hi>Adam</hi> are. And if indeed it be made evident, That amongſt other Errands, one voice of the Rod now upon us, is, <hi>Let my people go, that they may ſerve me;</hi> Let my faithful Miniſters have liberty to advance my Goſpel. I hope, thoſe, who are particularly called to from Heaven, will not be diſobedient.</p>
            <p>Again, I was willing ſo far as was conſiſtent with my main Design, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent to the World (if any yet be ignorant of it) the nature of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt us; however to manifeſt thus much, how willing, yea, how earneſtly deſirous ſome (if not all) of thoſe ſuſpended from their Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Employments, are to be re-admitted to the ſame; and what reaſonable terms they beg<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and readily offer a ſubmiſſion to, if they might be heard, that ſo they, who are ſo forward to condemn them all as obſtinate and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, may be more wary of their cenſures, and confine them to thoſe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whom they know ſo guilty.</p>
            <p>And I hop't I might do ſomething to quicken all thoſe, whoſe hearts are affected with the Concernments of the Church, to more earneſtneſs in their Addreſſes to God, That he, in whoſe hands the heart of Kings and all men are, would incline our Superious to hearken to the Requeſts, and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to regard the Cauſe of ſo many of the Servants of Chriſt; who, when his Church ſo much needs their labours, and they would ſo willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpend themſelves in the ſervice of ſouls, are to the ſadning of their hearts, in a great meaſure rendered unſerviceable in their Generations.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, Thus much however I ſhall attain, <hi>viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> the ſatisfaction of my Conſcience in the diſcharge of my Duty; that I can herein approve my ſelf to God and my own ſoul, that I have done what in me lies, toward the procuring of my own and others Liberty; that, if it ſhall ſtill be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I may have nothing to charge my ſelf with in this reſpect: and may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort my ſelf in this, that the improvement of ſuch a Liberty, ſhall no more be required of me, by the righteous Judge of Heaven and Earth, than the improvement of a great Eſtate, or a place of Honour, or ſome ſuch Talent, with which I was never entruſted. And if I obtain but thus much
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:54206:38"/>
(though I ſtrongly hope for more) I ſhall be far from repenting of my undertaken labour: for I muſt confeſs, that ſeems not to me a ſmall thing, which any way conduceth to my having of boldneſs before my Lord, at the day of his appearing.</p>
            <p>A word or two more I ſhall take Liberty to add upon this Head, before I relinquiſh it. If the removal of ſo many Labourers out of the Lords Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt is ſo grievous a Sin, both in its ſelf, and the ſad conſequences of it, then all others, and even they themſelves, ſo far as they have contributed to this their removal, or have not ſince endeavoured to prevent thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences have cauſe to be greatly humbled.</p>
            <p>And firſt, Even all the People who have ſinned their Teachers into cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, by their Pride, Wantonneſs, and Unfruitfulneſs under the Means of Grace. But eſpecially thoſe private Perſons, who by their malice either did, or at leaſt endeavoured to contribute to their ejection, or to the haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it. What Volumns might be compoſed (even another Book of Martyrs or Confeſſors rather) of the Sufferings many of theſe Servants of Chriſt have met with, from the Arbitrary violence of unreaſonable men? For I ſpeak not of what the Law hath impoſed on them. How have ſome been toſs't from place to place, their Houſes ſearched, and they confined, and all this either upon groundleſs ſuſpition, or falſe accuſations: for where was the man of them that hath yet been proved guilty of Treaſon or Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Oh the notorious groſs Lyes and Perjuries, that ſome of their Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have been guilty of, both before, and ſince their ejection?</p>
            <p>And yet how readily accepted by many? And what's the ground of all? Why, alas, they had got many Hearers, the Great-ones eſpecially, who were ſcandalized at the ſtrictneſs of their Doctrines and Lives, and angry that they might not go to Hell quietly, who ſtudied to be Revenged on them for the diſturbance they had received from them in their Sins. Thus I dare confidently ſay, it hath been with many. And though ſuch may have thought they have been doing God good ſervice, whileſt they have been perſecuting his Miniſters, yet believe it, they ſhall have ſmall thanks from him, that ſent them upon that Errand, the delivery whereof may have brought them ſo much trouble, and that they ſhall find to their ſmart without true repentance, if many of them have not already. What, could not men be content to reject the Embaſſy God ſent them, but they muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure and abuſe his Embaſſadors too? Shal not God proclaim war againſt that people that have thus violated the Law of Nations? They would ſcarce have done thus to an Embaſſadour ſent from the Turk, to perſwade us to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change Chriſt for <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and the Goſpel for the <hi>Alcoran.</hi> But, Oh, let let them alone, they are ſafe enough. 'Tis the Factious Non-conformiſt,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:54206:38"/>
not the Chriſtian Miniſter they have medled with. Not the Holy Jeſus, that came from Heaven to bring men thither, was Crucified; but (if you will believe his Adverſaries) an enemy to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and a mover of Sedition; not <hi>Paul</hi> a Servant and Worſhipper of the moſt High God, but a certain peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Fellow, a Ringleader of a Sect, was accuſed. The World hath ſtill ſome Policy and Modeſty in the drawing up its Indictments, and dare not directly make Holineſs a Crime. Well, Sirs, it will be happy for you, if you ſhall be found to have had ſo much wit in your anger, as that you ſhall at laſt be able to diſtinguiſh your ſelves out of Gods diſpleaſure: but if there ſhould be any thing found in Chriſtianity, engaging to that you call Non-conformity; or if you have made This<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but a pretence for your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity againſt That; I would not for a Thouſand Worlds be in your caſe, for all your diſtinctions, when God ſhall ariſe thorowly to plead his Peoples cauſe: And even now ſure he is beginning to do it. And if under the Rod, you continue the ſin for which you are laſh't, bethink you how to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that ſtartling Queſtion, <hi>Who ever hardned himſelf againſt God, and prosper'd!</hi> And juſtly hath God ſuited his Judgments to this ſin of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple A Famine of the Word they feared not, and therefore may God have ſent upon Thouſands what they account more dreadful, a Famine of bread. 'Tis juſt that they who loath'd the Manna, and were weary of the bread of Life, ſhould want bread to put into their mouths. And they who could not endure theſe terrible Preachers, let them now ſpeak, whether the Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or the Execution, be the more terrible? Now, Sirs, what ſay you to ſin? Is it ſuch a harmleſs thing as you thought it, or not? Doth not God now ſpeak againſt it, in ſomething a louder and harſher Language, than your Bawling Preachers were wont? Under them you could ſleep, but now ſleep away this Sermon if you can; even this awakening Sermon, which the Plague of God makes to you. And if you go on in your hardneſs, you ſhall find to your coſt, that the Hell and Damnation which their Pulpits did ſo thunder againſt wickedneſs was but a painted fire, to that you ſhall eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally feel.</p>
            <p>But from others who have been the unjuſt cauſes of your Sufferings, to your ſelves, I ſhall addreſs my ſelf: <hi>Honoured Fathers, and Dear Brethren,</hi> with whom my boldneſs will not, I am confident, be miſconſtrued. Since you will readily acknowledge, that all that hath befal'n you, is juſt, as from God you cannot then but lay it on your ſins; and theſe, I hope, it is your daily buſineſs to reflect on, and beg pardon for. Though I am well aſſu'd, the holineſs, diligence and painfulneſs of many of you hath been ſuch, that to Men you may well acquit your ſelves, and may be worthy patterns to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and ſhame and ſilence your Accnſers; yet to God you cannot ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:54206:39"/>
juſtifie your ſelves, I know you dare not. Oh might not you have done more to promote the Intereſt of your Lord and Maſter, than you did? Some of you I mean; for I profeſs without all partialitie or flatterie, I think ſome did ſtrive to the verie utmoſt of their power, to improve all opportunities for the good of Souls, and now in their Conſciences they have the fruits of it; but of theſe there were few, too few. Oh be humbled then for all your Negligence, Covetouſneſs, and Self-ſeeking; your Pride and Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; that you were more averſe from the offers of Peace and Union, than you ought; that you kept ſo much ado about your own wayes and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſtood wrangling about this Trifle or that, whil'ſt greater Works were left undone: And dailie make Solemn Engagements to God, that if once more he will entruſt you with forfeited priviledges, you will be more faithful and vigorous than ever yet you have been, in the work of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; that you will no more take your eaſe, nor ſeek your ſelves, nor waſte precious time in needleſs Controverſies; nor confine godlineſs to any with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out book Niceties of your own; nor lay the Peace of the Church upon your particular Opinions, but will readilie join with all that are willing, in the owning and preſſing onlie the things that are neceſſarie to Salvation; and will uſe all means, both publick and private, for the converſion of Souls. And if God grant your prayers, as in his due time he may, See that you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member theſe promiſes.</p>
            <p>But 'tis the ſecond Branch I would have you chieflie to conſider; and that is your not endeavouring what you might, to prevent ſome of thoſe ſad conſequences of your Excluſion, which I before mentioned; in that you have not embrac't all the opportunies that were yet afforded you, for the doing good to the people, to bring them from ſin to God; and ſo your negligence may have haſtned and help't forward Gods indignation. Let me not be thought too ſawcie, Sirs, I beſeech you, for in the ſame plain dealing I have uſed hitherto, I am reſolved to conclude. I muſt needs ſay then, if they are not to be excuſed who have deprived you of your publick Libertie, no more are you, if you have not improved that private Libertie they left you for doing your Maſters work. I muſt profeſs it hath troubled me, to hear men pray ſo earneſtlie, and talk ſo much for the Reſtauration of their Liberties, and to ſee them make ſo little uſe of thoſe the Law allow'd them. And it might too much tempt men to fear, that their Secular intereſts went neareſt to their hearts; and that they chieflie mean a Libertie, to receive their main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance again, to live they and their Families at their former Rates; or to be able to inſult over, and give Laws to thoſe in the Church, who now tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple upon and deſpiſe them. I know <hi>Daily Bread</hi> may be pray'd for, but the <hi>Coming of God's Kingdom</hi> muſt have the prioritie, both in our prayers and endeavours.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:54206:39"/>
The Caſe is weightie, Sirs, and deſerves your ſerious conſideration, To go and preach the Goſpel you entered into an Engagement, and received a Commiſſion, the validitie whereof (though to ſome of you given, by the laying on of the hands of the Presbyterie onlie) I ſuppoſe you queſtion not, nor I think ſcarce anie one elſe, till verie latelie. Well, it being thus, I would know how you can ſhift off the neceſſitie that lies upon you to preach this Goſpel, and the Woe in caſe of your negligence. You may replie, <hi>You have not leave given you, nor yet any maintenance allowed.</hi> But pray you, Who give the Apoſtles and Primitive Chriſtians leave for Three hundred Years after Chriſt, and who maintain'd them? Where was ſuch a Clauſe inſerted in your Commiſſion, <hi>Alwayes provided that the Rulers of the World give you leave to perform your Duties?</hi> This would agree with the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks of that Gentleman, who being, I fear, deſign'd to take God out of the World, in courteſie to us, ſomewhat to prevent our confuſion, would ſet up Monarchs little leſs limited than He. But if our Anceſtors had gone by this Rule, where had the Goſpel been? or where is it excepted, <hi>That you muſt have ſuch and ſuch proviſions, or elſe not to Preach?</hi> For my own part I acknowledge my ſelf a verie mean Caſuiſt, and ignorant of Twentie ſubtle diſtinctions, which here might be needful. And I am verie confident, I am ſpeaking to few, but are more knowing, and better ſtudied in this point, than my ſelf; and great difficulties there are to me, concerning the relation betwixt a Paſtor, and a people, as matters now ſtand with us; how far it holds, and how far men are engaged to perform all the duties of that rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; wherefore to that I ſhall ſay little or nothing; onlie ſo far as concerns my ſelf, and verie manie more, yea, all in part, I uſe thus plainlie to reſolve the caſe to my ſelf; when my underſtanding is moſt help't, by a powerful apprehenſion of death and judgment near at hand.</p>
            <p>I take it for the indiſpenſable duty of every man, to employ himſelf to the utmoſt in his place and calling, in anſwering the ends of his Creation and Redemption, the glorifying of God, in doing his beſt to ſave his own, and others Souls. And if I have been Solemnly Conſecrated to this work, to make it my verie particular Calling, no Command of the higheſt Emperor iu the World can diſoblige me from it: God muſt be honoured, the Goſpel proclaimed, Souls ſaved, my Vows performed, ſtorm and rage, forbid and hinder it, who will or can. But if there happen ſuch terms to be put upon me, as the condition of my more open exerciſe of the Function I am devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to, which terms, after the uſe of all due means for Information, I judge I cannot lawfully ſubmit to; but yet others will, whoſe apprehenſions vary from mine, who will in ſome competent meaſure carry on the Publick work I was employed in, which I am forbid to meddle with: Then, in ſuch a caſe,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:54206:40"/>
(which, if I miſtake not, is ours) I will caſt about which way I may do moſt, for thoſe ends I am obliged to carry on. And ſince Chriſtianity it ſelf is not forbid to be Preach't, only I muſt not do it, <hi>viz.</hi> not Publickly; but yet others will, and in many places do: And I foreſee that by ruſhing upon the Publick Preaching, more hurt would come of my diſobedience, than good; and I ſhould be more out of a capacity for future Service, either by Impriſonment, Baniſhment, or the like; (which are not ſo much to be ſhun'd as Sufferings, but as they hinder the attainment of my ends) I will then ſee what private opportunities are afforded me for thoſe ends, and theſe with all readineſs I will accept, and diligently improve; as in which, all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances conſidered, I may do moſt for the advancement of the Goſpel: And therefore is not to be thought an effect of Cowardice, a baſeneſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy him that remembers what it ſounds to be a <hi>CHRISTIAN;</hi> but as my taking that way, which moſt conduceth to Gods glory, and the Intereſt of Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And this is no other than the courſe <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf took, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 2. when he communicated the Goſpel privately, to them that were of Reputation (and why? for fear, or ſhame? no, but) leſt he ſhould run in vain.</p>
            <p>But if Circumſtances ſhould ſo alter the caſe, that I ſee, venturing upon Publick Preaching, be the moſt probable way for the accompliſhment of my juſt deſigns, then I will embrace that: Or if I ſhould be forbid privately to endeavour the Salvation of Souls, then I muſt, and will diſobey, let what will be the event; becauſe ſuch commands directly contradict thoſe ends I muſt promote, and leave me no way for the attaining of them: Yea, though I dye for it, I muſt tell thoſe within my reach, who gave us our Being, and keeps us alive, and to what end; who ſhed his blood for us, and why; and what we muſt do to be made partakers of the benefits he hath purchaſed: I muſt tell them of the evil and danger of ſin, whither it leads, and what an Heaven holineſs will end in. Theſe are matters that the World muſt know, though a thouſand deaths attend upon the Publiſhers: And I would no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger care for a tongue or hand, than whil'ſt I might ſpeak or write of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> One word more, and I ſhall conclude this: But it ſo happening ſince the loſs of my Liberty, that my ſelf, and thoſe that depend on me, may be reduc't to ſuch preſſing neceſſities, that I muſt be taken up much more than I was wont, ſome way or other for the procuring of a Livelihood (the ſad caſe at preſent of many precious, eminent Miniſters) then I will betake my ſelf to ſuch care and pains as is requiſite hereto; in the mean time not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſhing my great Work, but regarding the World (as all ought to do, and indeed the moſt of what I have ſaid, is appliable to private Chriſtians) onlie with a ſubſerriencie to it. And this again we may find juſtified by
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:54206:40"/>
               <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf: whom, if you had found buſie at work, in making his Tents, yet you could not have charged him with neglect of the Goſpel: for even then he was contriving how to render it moſt acceptable.</p>
            <p>And thus I have given in my brief thoughts of this Caſe, which, though it may ſeem a digreſſion from the matter in hand, yet is it not ſo from my main deſign, if it may do the leaſt to quicken any to a ſenſe of their dutie, and the neglects of it, and to put them upon more carefulneſs for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And hence many may ſee, how guilty they have been, in not lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out themſelves for the good of ſouls, ſo far as they might, without breaking any Law, or running any hazard. Oh Sirs, you are men ſure ſomewhat ſenſible of what worth a ſoul is: and what weighty things Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and Damnation are, which careleſs Wretches do but jeſt with, as words of courſe. Why have you not then laboured more in theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters! Let none miſunderſtand me, I ſpeak to the negligent only. Could we have done no more for God and mens ſouls, to inform the ignorant, convince the obſtinate, quicken the godly, than we have done? Might there not have been, through the bleſſing of God even upon our private la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, fewer to provoke, and more to pleaſe him, more to ſtrive with him by their prayers to turn away his wrath, than there are?</p>
            <p>And upon the ſame account, I would beg all private Chriſtians to lay to heart their lamentable dulneſs, aud uſeleſsneſs in the Places and Towns where they dwell. Oh how little are their Neighbours and Acquaintance, I wiſh, I might not ſay their Families, better for many of them! So little do they make Religion their buſineſs: but in all their converſe are even like other men; only plodding on in a life-leſs Profeſſion, and track of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and appearing a little zealous for ſome By-opinions of their own. It was time for them to be raiſed out of their heavy, luke-warm temper, and to be made to mind and reliſh a little more the weighty Truths and Matters of Religion. Reader, Art thou an Honourer of Chriſt, and a Lover of Mankind? Why tell me then, is it not a moſt lamentable thing to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, That almoſt all the World, yea, almoſt all the Chriſtian, and Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Chriſtian World is drowned in wickedneſs: and that there is ſo little Savoury Salt in it; ſo few that ſtudy and labour to make the Goſpel obtain amongſt men in the life and power of it? How do the moſt ſeek their own things, how few the things of Jeſus Chriſt? Oh that men were once throughly perſwaded, that his things were theirs! Some are too buſie about Puppet-plays, the petty trifles of the World, which, yet to thoſe, who are ſwallowed upin them, ſeem weighty and important; to mind much what becomes of mens immortal ſouls. Let the poor Curate, that muſt live by it, ſee to ſuch low affairs. Others have ſo much to do to keep up
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:54206:41"/>
their own Parties, Opinions and Cuſtoms, That Chriſt may look to his Goſpel himſelf for them, except as it lies in the way to the things they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count moſt their Concern. But all you the Miniſters of Chriſt, if indeed you take his Work it ſelf for your Honour, Pleaſure, and Wages, though many of you may want thoſe encouragements which are ſo requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite and deſirable for your ſucceſs; yet, be awakened to do all the ſervice you can to your Lord and Maſter? Let us not ſtand accuſing any for the removal of our opportunities, whileſt we have ſo many before us, if we had the hearts and skill to uſe them. How glad would the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, or our Proteſtant Martyrs have been of thoſe Priviledges we enjoy, though they might earneſtly have deſired more? What Sirs, are there no poor ſouls near you, that cry aloud for your help, to ſave them from the burning lake, to reſcue them out of the jaws of Death, and ſnares of the Devil, by whom they are led captive at his will? Theſe, theſe are they, upon whom eſpecially you ought to employ all your skill and pains, and from him that died for them, you ſhall have your reward. I know the Godly alſo call for ſtrengthning direction, comfort, and quickning; but ſurely your principal (much leſs your only) work is not with them; the miſerable creatures that are juſt at the Graves mouth, and yet know not what they came into the World for, require ſpeedie and ſeaſonable help. Oh how many Thouſands may now be out of your reach, whom you once might have ſpoken to, but did not! Who hinders you from going to ſuch, and diſcourſing to them the matters that concern their everlaſting Peace? Cannot you watch opportunities when they can beſt have while to hear you, and are moſt likelie to regard you? You that live amongſt your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer people, cannot you go to their Houſes, and take all occaſion of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with them, and be inculcating on them the great Truths and Duties of the Goſpel? If you never formerly took this courſe of private dealing with your people, ſet upon it now, and you know not but it may be more effectual than all your former labours were. Some that have tried, have had good ſucceſs. However, you will have comfort in doing your dutie. Oh go often, as you have time, amongſt you poor Neighbours, and ſee in what a ſtate their ſouls are, and be not ſo uncharitable and hard-hearted, as to ſee them dropping into Hell, and yet do nothing to prevent it. Though 'tis amongſt Strangers you are caſt, yet acquaint your ſelves with them, and do them all the good you can, as knowing every man's your Neighbour that needs your help. Put then upon reading good Books, and take account of them, and learn what their knowledge in Religion is, and accordingly inſtruct and adviſe them. But far be it from me, to preſume to give Directions for the Work, others have done it fully; and you know
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:54206:41"/>
it well enough if you would but ſet to it with all your might: oh follow then the example of <hi>Paul,</hi> who went about from houſe to houſe, night and day, warning and beſeething every one with tears. What do you think this is not preaching the Goſpel? Do you think that's only, whilſt you ſtand on a high place in the midſt of an Aſſemby? Did not Chriſt preach the Goſpel to a Woman alone, and <hi>Philip</hi> to the Eunuch? In ſome reſpects 'tis evident perſonal diſcourſe hath much the advantage of publick Preaching; and why may we not expect Gods bleſſing hereupon, as well as on the other? Now Sirs, we have an happy opportunity of diſcovering what pure love to the Goſpel will do with us, without any hopes of a Temporal Reward. What moved you to Preach to your people before? I know you will not joyn with the Quakers in accuſing your ſelves, and ſay it was for your Tythes. What then, was it a deſire to ſave the Souls of your people? Why I hope their Salvation is as precious in your eyes now, as then; and do not they as much need your aſſiſtance? Why then do not you continue it? Say not, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will not bear it, for many will. Try them once again, and where any are obſtinate, let your love and courteſie do its utmoſt to overcome them. Oh let us but work out own hearts into lively affectionate apprehenſions of the great concernments of Souls, and ſtudy more what God is, and why he made us; what the Death of Chriſt imports, what it is for a Soul to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved or damned for ever; and we ſhall ſcarce be able to refrain ſpeaking to all we can light upon; but we ſhall rather ask every man we meet, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he hath yet done his beſt to make ſure his everlaſting happineſs? whether hee's yet got from under the wrath of God, and out of danger of Hell? Theſe things will be ready to burſt from us in the very ſtreets, or open Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations. Oh had we but that zeal, and thoſe affections which theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters deſerve, and will very well warrant, what work might we make in the world, yet keeping in all due bounds of ſobriety and prudence? Though perhaps we might be counted mad-men for our pains, as Chriſt himſelf and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> were. But remember then, I would have you ſpend your zeal upon the things that are worth it; proportion it to the weight of the truths you inſiſt on. I would not have you take this pains to make men of your opinion, in controverted matters. Beware of that, deſigning a party will ſpoil all your work. Labour you to make them Members of Chriſt, what need you care then what particular Church they are members of, or wherein they differ from you in matters, that concern not their Salvation? Do the beſt you can to heal all breaches, make none, widen none. Let men cenſure us as long as they will for Schiſmatical and Turbulent; and if all our profeſſions to the contrary may not be heard, yet let our practiſes witneſs to God, to the world, and to our own Conſciences, that we are true lovers of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:54206:42"/>
Piety and Peace. See that you have no other aims but Gods glory, and hee'l own, and Crown you for your labour of love. Say not now, this is a difficult work, but tell me whether it be not needful? If the Devil and his Inſtruments ſit ſtill, then do you ſo to; Remember what a Covenant you made in Baptiſme, beſide all other Engagements ſince.</p>
            <p>Think what you live for, and where you expect to ſtand ſhortly, and tell me whether a life thus laid out for God, will not then be your comfort? Oh for the Lords ſake then all you his Servants up and be doing, and fear not: For God will be with you, what are you afraid of enemies? Do you think this will procure you more hatred and ſufferings? And awaken Powers to greater jealouſies, and cauſe them to abridge you of the liberty yet reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved? Never fear it, Sirs, why don't you know what I am preſſing you to? Is it to propagate Chriſtianity; and this is a work that muſt and ſhall be done: for God hath ſaid it, and hee'l ſee to it; and for this the World is yet kept up. Oh Sirs, pure, ſimple, and uncorrupted Chriſtianity, deſerves all our time and ſtudy, and pains to advance it. And it hath ſuch Comforts and Crowns, for its reſolved Friends and Perſecuted followers, that would make a man even long to be ſuffering for it; and the more he ſuffers, the more he will ſtill love, the firmlier adhere to it. Chriſtianity, It is a Religion of that force and excellency, that it defies oppoſitions, and ſcorns all banks and bounds. It awes its greateſt Adverſaries, and a Priſoner at the bar with it, may make his Judge upon the Bench to tremble, and the ſturdy Jaylour that even now whipt him, come quaking to beg a Pardon. Fear not Priſons, for the Goſpel can never be bound. Let this alone be your rule, and value not what Law or will of man ſhall contradict it. Kings and Emperours with all their Officers, and Armies, Edicts and Authorities, are but Trophee's to its Power; like dams they'l make it riſe the higher, and overbear all before it; experience confirms what I ſay. This cake of barley bread will tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble down all the Tents of a Midianitiſh Hoſt; The noiſe of its Trumpets, the light of the Lamps (though the Pitchers that bear them, theſe earthen veſſels our bodies, be broken) and crying out; The Word of the Lord, and his Son Chriſt Jeſus, will diſcomfit Innumerable Armies, and make them run, and cry, and flee. This is the Goſpel, and let all that read theſe lines ſay, Let it go on and Proſper, let it run and be Glorified, and ſtrike its hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Sword to the hearts of its Adverſaries. Now this is it, and this alone, which I would beſeech all to ſpend themſelves for, and fear not but it will bear your charges. Let your work be purely Gods, and if he can bear you out he will; and I hope you don't doubt that. But let me once again beg you, to ſee that you make the cauſe you work for, the ſame that Chriſt and his Apoſtles drove on in the world, and then how joyfully may you ſuffer
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:54206:42"/>
for it, whatever men call your actions and deſigns. 'Tis nothing ſtrange to ſuffer for Chriſt from nominal Chriſtians; nor for Peace and Truth, from men that call themſelves Orthodox and Catholick; this hath been often in the world! Let then the weighty, but much neglected Doctrines and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Goſpel be urged with all earneſtneſſe, but leſſer things leſſe regarded. Talk leſſe of the Times, but more of Eternity. Stand not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing who ſhould have Power in the Church to men, that are yet under the Power of the Devil; nor of a Ceremony or Form of Prayer, to thoſe that know not God, nor their own ſouls. What ſtrange things would theſe be to Catechize an Heathen in; and are they much fitter for Carnal ones? But oh labour to work men into the true temper, and Spirit of Religion, which conſiſts ſo much in love to God and our Brethren; and then the new nature that is in them, the inward reliſh of their Souls, and renewed prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of light, will enable them to judge of things that differ, and all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of moment God will reveal to them.</p>
            <p>Again, I have need to requeſt that I be not judged immodeſt, if the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed haſte I now write in, have carried me out to a more than ſeemly earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor yet count me Pragmatical for venturing thus to adviſe, ſince I deſire no more regard then what the reaſonableneſſe, and weight of the things propoſed ſhall be found to deſerve.</p>
            <p>And thus at length, through Gods aſſiſtance, I am even com'n to the end of my task. I have endeavoured to ſhew, wherein it is, we have from the higheſt to the loweſt done amiſs, and provoked God againſt us; I have alſo mingled Directions, ſo far as my intended brevity would permit; for the performance of thoſe duties, that may appeaſe his wrath, and make us hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in his favour.</p>
            <p>And oh that theſe weak endevaours might have an iſſue anſwerable to their Deſign! then how confidently durſt I ſay we ſhould be an happy Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by becoming holy, which is all I have aimed at. But what talk I of my endeavours? What ſhall be now the iſſue of Gods Judgments that have been upon us? Shall we be bettered by them or not? Oh one would think there ſhould ſcarce an obſtinate Sinner be left in the Nation after this? But that we ſhould all with one conſent return to the God who hath ſmitten us, from whom we have back-ſlidden? One would think we ſhould now imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whom after Eminent Judgments we find en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into a Covenant, to ſeek and ſerve the Lord their God, to which their Kings were wont to call them. And oh that God would put it into the heart of his Majeſty, to engage all his People even from one end of the Land to the other, to enter into ſuch a ſolemn vow; that we will in all things be careful to walk in thoſe ways God hath enjoyned us, and not in any thing
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:54206:43"/>
voluntarily break his holy Laws? Oh that ſome ſuch an engagement was made the bond of our Union; our entrance into and obſervance of it the condition of our Church-Communion? Of what a bleſſed conſequence would even this be? But this and all other ſuch great wiſhes, let us reſerve for our prayers; and give me leave with ſome jealouſie to demand, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all that God hath done ſhall be loſt upon us? What ſhall our Nation ſtill be drowned in ſin? So ſoon as ever the Rod's from off us, ſhall we to our old courſes again? Shall Profaneneſs abound, and Religion be deſpiſed again? Shall Taverns, and Brothel-houſes, and Play-houſes be frequented, and Gods Worſhip ſlighted, and neglected again? Will the abominable and filthy be ſo ſtill? Shall Blaſphemy, and Swearing, and Curſing, be as loud as ever? Will men again to the World, and their Pleaſures, as buſily as ever? And make as light of his Threatnings and Promiſes, and laugh at the talk of death and judgment, as they were wont to do? Shall God ſtill be mock't with Formalities, and diſhonoured by mens Lives? Will the Hater of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs ſtill riſe higher in his Rage? Will the execution of Juſtice be as much neglected as ever? And will the Man of Violence ſwell his Fingers into Loyns, and exchange his Rods for Scorpions? Will men ſtill cloſe their eys againſt the cleareſt light, and reject the apparent and only means for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling our differences, and eſtabliſhing our peace upon ſure foundations? Or will they yet ſtrive to aggravate the bitterneſs of mens ſpirits, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue their deſign of cruſhing them into the very dirt? Shall we yet be rent and torn with animoſities and diviſions? And ſhall they that ought to cure, keep up and encreaſe them? Shall we ſtill, inſtead of accuſing our ſelves and ſin, dip our Pens and Tongues in Gall, and cry out, one ſide on the Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical, Cruel and Oppreſſive; the other, on the Murmurers, Male-contents, and Fault-finders? Will theſe, and all other diſorders be ſtill continued? Oh God forbid that it ſhould be thus, that we ſhould grow worſe under the Phyſitians hand, and that none of his ſtrongeſt Medicines ſhould work? Shall we cauſe God to complain of us, that he would have healed us, but we would not be healed? That in vain hath he ſmitten us, for that we would not receive Correction? Oh that ſuch a poor Worm as I, could do any thing to prevent ſuch a ſad concluſion; for Woe to us, if God depart from us, leaving us to our ſelves, reſolving to ſtrike us no more, but letting us alone till he deſtroy us in our ſins. My words are like to ſpread but a little way, but oh that they might have ſome effect where they light.</p>
            <p>To thee, <hi>Reader,</hi> let me betake my ſelf: What have the workings of thy Soul been, whil'ſt thou haſt been reading theſe Lines? and what influence have they upon thee? What, hath not they Conſcience ſmote thee, ſpeak the truth, and told thee plainlie, <hi>Thou haſt been a Troubler of the Land, and</hi>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:54206:43"/>
               <hi>haſt help't to bring the Plague upon us?</hi> In the ſight of God, I demand of thee, <hi>Haſt thou not been guilty of ſome of the ſins here deſcribed, Covetouſneſs or Pride, Luxury or Oppreſſion, or the like?</hi> And what now? doſt thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn thy ſelf for thy follie? Wilt thou make all ſpeed to get a Peace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed betwixt God and thy Soul, and a Separation made betwixt thy Soul and Sin? Or on the other hand, Art thou not in a rage, that thy ſin hath been too plainlie diſplayed, and too much diſgrac't? Thy darling ſin which thou art reſolved to keep, though thou have Hell with it? Art thou not fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming excuſes, and ſaying, <hi>Thou canſt not believe that ſuch and ſuch things which thou haſt a mind to, are ſuch heinous matters, and ſo diſpleaſing to God?</hi> Or elſe art thou remiſs and ſtupid, never thinking this or that, onlie toſſing over the Book, and paſſing this cenſure on it, and throwing it down without anie more regard? Trulie this is it I moſt fear; for this is the general pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing temper: Oh therefore that I could but rouze thee to an apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of thy ſelf, and thy own eſtate. Reader, Sure thou art one that wouldſt not willinglie be damn'd; Wilt thou then hearken to a moſt reaſonable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt I ſhall make to thee, before I conclude? Thou haſt now been awhile reading theſe Lines, which have been as a Bill of Indictment againſt our Land, and have deciphered what our eſpecial crying ſins are. Wilt thou now when thou ſhut'ſt the Book, get alone, and ſpend but as much time in reading thy own heart and life, and ſearch and ſee whether none of theſe ſins be thine? It may be this is a work thou never didſt in thy life yet, but wilt thou now bring thy heart to it? 'Tisin vain to ask thee, whether thou wilt forſake thy ſin, if thou wilt not ſet upon examining thy ſelf to find it out. What ſay'ſt thou then in the Name of God to this my earneſt Requeſt? What, ſhall I be denied? Is it a great matter I ask of thee, to withdraw thy ſelf from the noiſe and buſle of the World, and of thy own vain thoughts, and to make a diligent ſearch into the ſtate of thy own ſoul, that being ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of thy ſin and danger, thou may'ſt yet get help? Wil't thou do thus much, or tell me plainlie, <hi>Wilt thou be damn'd firſt?</hi> For I'le aſſure thee, thy Damnation is never like to be prevented without ſerious Conſideration, and that's it I would beg thee to: Which is it thou wilt chooſe? To ſet upon thy Dutie, or to venture upon Helf? Sure thy mind cannot but anſwer one way or other. <hi>Reader,</hi> be awakened, take not theſe for words of courſe; from God I ſpeak to thee, 'tis God looks on thee; he knows the thoughts and intentions of thy heart, upon thy reading theſe demands. And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever courſe thou take, whether thou wilt examine thy ſelf, and forſake thy ſins, or not, yet thou canſt not ſay but God hath given thee fair Warning. He now ſtands over thee with his Rod in his hand, and asks thee, <hi>Whether yet thou wilt ſeek, and ſerve him?</hi> If thy Self-examinations ſhall have made
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:54206:44"/>
way at all for ſuch a demand, I would know in the next place, <hi>Whether thou wilt ſtrive to put away ſin, every ſin from thee, or wilt thou not? Art thou yet willing to be reconciled to God?</hi> Be it known to thee, <hi>Oh ſinner,</hi> whoever thou art, yet there is hopes; from the Lord thy Maker and Redeemer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I tell thee ſo: What would the Damned give for ſuch a word? If thou wilt but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiallie conſider thy wayes, bewail thy ſin, and loath it; turn from it, and from the World, to the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, reſting on his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in and through his Son, ſetting upon a courſe of ſerious holineſs, and continuing therein to the end, doing this, be aſſured thy Soul ſhall live. Something of this I ſpoke at the beginning, and cannot ſtand to ſay more on it now: Here's enough to inform thee (if thou kneweſt it not) what thy Dutie is? <hi>But art thou willing to perform it?</hi> One would think thou ſhouldeſt ſoon be reſolved what to do. The queſtion is, <hi>Whether thou wilt do thy utmoſt to change thy heart and life, that thou may'ſt be ſaved? Or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou wilt go in ſin, and be damned?</hi> I have told thee upon what terms thou may'ſt yet eſcape thy Ruine: but withall know, This muſt be done. ſpeedilie, or perhaps not at all. If thou delayeſt one hour, thou may'ſt be in Hell the next. God nath born with thee long, now he is making ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er work; he will not alwayes wait for nothing. They heart quicklie he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, this he will have, or thy hearts-blood.</p>
            <p>Away with thy ſin then with all poſſible ſpeed; if thou retain it, it will be thy death; for a Hue and Cry's gone out from Heaven againſt it, and the man in whoſe hands 'tis found, ſhall ſurelie dye: Then caſt it away, if thou love thy life, thy everlaſting life.</p>
            <p>But what art thou one of thoſe ſenſleſs, brutiſh, blockiſh ſouls, that a man had almoſt as good ſpend his breath upon a ſtone wall, as talk to thee! Art thou nothing moved with all thou readeſt or neareſt, but takeſt all for words of courſe, which thou forgetteſt as ſoon as the noiſe is out of thy ears? Doſt thou now lay aſide the Book, and go about thy wonted buſineſs, as if thou hadſt not been reading for Life or Death? But a kind of Story, that no way concerns thee? Wilt thou now riſe up, and go to thy worldly cares, thy Company, or vain Diſcourſe, inſtead of getting alone to God with humble acknowledgments of thy ſin, and earneſt cryes for mercy? If thou waſt infected with the Plague, and had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ſt been reading what Medicines thou ſhould'ſt uſe, would'ſt thou lay by the Book, and never mind more, as if thou hadſt done enough to read them, without taking care to apply them? And wilt thou now be guilty of a madneſs as much greater than this, as ſin and Hell, are worſe than the Plague and Death? Art thou reſolved though Chriſt himſelf ſhould kneel to thee, and beſeech thee (as he doth by me) to ſearch they heart, and review thy wayes, and deteſt thy ſins, that he might
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:54206:44"/>
ſave thee, that yet thou wouldeſt not grant his deſire, nor ever put thy ſelf to ſo much Labour as Converſion will coſt thee? If thou be ſuch a ſtupid `reſolved ſinner, that wilt remain in thy old wayes, come on it what will; yea, and believeſt all ſhall be well enough with thee for all that, what can I ſay to thee more? God be Judge between thee and me; Thou art deſtroyed, not becauſe thou couldeſt have no help, nor becauſe it was not offered thee, but becauſe thou didſt wilfully reſuſe it. But, poor Creature, my heart even akes for thee, and loth I am to leave thee in this wretched<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> dull, diſtracted temper; wherein if Death, that is now ſo buſie abroad, ſhould find thee, thou art undone for ever. Oh that yet I could ſpeak ſomething that would make thee feel and fear. Tell me then, thou who art now ſo bold and reſolute, ſo ſottiſh and careleſs, Doſt thou not think thou ſhalt dye? Why, what wilt thou do then? Think on it, and think again, I befeech thee. Is it not great odds, but the Contagion may ſhortly reach thee? What courſe wilt thou then take, when thou ſhalt ſee the Tokens of God upon thee? Which way wilt thou look, or what wilt thou do for help? Then go to the ſins thou haſt loved ſo dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſee what comfort they will afford. Now call for a Cup, or a Whore; Never be daunted man. Shall one of thy courage quail, that couldſt have mockt at the Threatnings of the Almighty God! What ſo boon and jolly but now, and now down ith' mouth? Here's a ſudden change indeed! Where are thy Companions? All fled? Where are thy darling pleaſures? All forſaken thee! What will thy Bags, and Bills, and Bonds, do thee no good? Why ſhouldeſt thou be dejected? Thou art a man of Worſhip, perhaps a Lord, or a Knight, or Gentleman; go chear thy ſelf, review thy good Purchaſes, think of thy high Titles, and rich Revenues! Go Gallants, get to your Galſs; Powder and Curle, Paint and Spot, Deck and Adorn you, as you were wont? 'What, do you take no pleaſure to view your Pale faces? Do your hearts ſink within you like a ſtone? Why how now poor creature, what hath the world left thee? The world thou didſt ſo dearly love, that Heaven was but a trifle to it! What, haſt thou miſplac't thy heart on a treacherous Friend, that fails thee in thy greateſt need? Muſt thou now all in ſilence and ſadneſs groan forth thy wretched Soul into another world? Now, now wretch, what hath thy ſin and careleſsneſs brought thee to? Now where is thy life of mirth and ſport? What wilt thou do now, when thy own comforts have left thee, and God loaths thee, and caſts out thy Death-bed howlings with diſdain? What doſt begin to call upon him now? Doſt think a few good words ſhall ſerve thy turn? Read <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 28. <hi>Go get thee to thy own gods, ſee whether they can help and deliver thee.</hi> Say not I would drive thee to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:54206:45"/>
deſpair; no, I would fain prevent it; and ſo may'ſt thou, if thou wilt but hearken in time; and that time's juſt now; for Death is even at thy back, and perhaps will take thee up as ſoon as the Book's laid down.</p>
            <p>But perhaps thou art one that think'ſt thy ſelf ſafe, and that this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing belongs to thee, becauſe thou may'ſt be recovered from the ſickneſs, or got out of the reach of it; or it may be ſo abated, that thou doſt not fear it; and therefore thou art ready fooliſhly to cry with <hi>Agag, The bitterneſs of death is paſt;</hi> but oh be convinc't of thy lamentable ſottiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; for thou mayſt yet be hew'n in pieces for all that. Read <hi>Amos</hi> 9. 12, 3, 4. And tell me whether God will not find thee out. Thou art run away from the City perhaps, but not from thy ſin; and therefore thou carrieſt the Plague along with thee, which ſooner or later will break out. But though eſcape the Plague, art thou then ſecure? If thou canſt but out-live this Mortality, doſt thou think all is well then? All danger over? No, hold there, Sinner; God hath not done with thee ſo; believe it, the worſt is yet to come. Alas, man, Death, Judgment and Hell are behind ſtill. I, but coming they are apace, and overtake thee at laſt they will, even all of them, if thou look not about thee in time. Patch and piece up thy mouldring Carkaſs as long as thou canſt; and ſhift thee hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and thither, from this diſeaſe or that; but after all be aſſured, <hi>Thou ſhalt dye.</hi> And after Death hath done its work upon thee, and the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment paſt, and Sentence executed, if thou then find all well with thee, boaſt, and ſpare not; but till then be ſilent. But if yet thou art fully bent to keep thy ſin, let me beg thee to think a little what is that Hell thou art leaping into; Oh think what the wrath, the flaming, unquench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able wrath of God is. Doſt thou make a piſh at it? 'Tis becauſe thou art an Infidel, or haſt loſt thy wits. I know thou canſt not awhile to think of it now, thou haſt pleaſanter things to take up thy thoughts, than death and Hell; and therefore thou laugheſt and ſingeſt, and merrily throweſt away thy hours, as if no hurt was near thee, whileſt thou ſtandeſt totter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the very brink of the bottomleſs Pit! And all this while, how many Devils whom thou ſeeſt not, ſtand ſome gaping to receive thee, and ſome labouring to make thee ſure, and till thee on? And multitudes of Deaths are waiting for a Commiſſion, any one of them to thruſt thee in, and then farwell all hope for ever. <hi>Oh ſpend but one hour, or half an hour in a day, in the ſober thoughts of Eternity, and go on in ſin if thou canſt.</hi> Good Reader, let me entreat thee to this courſe; but if thou cryeſt, <hi>Thou haſt ſomewhat elſe to do:</hi> Know, thou ſhalt ſhortly have nothing elſe to do, but to feel that which now thou wilt not be brought to think of, that thou mighteſt avoid it; and then ſay, If thou hadſt not good

counſel given thee once, if thou hadſt had the wit and the grace to take it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> One moments experience ſhall at length convince thee more, than all thy hearing or reading would. Thou counteſt Plague, Famine and Sword, Earthquakes, Thunder and Lightning, terrible things; oh then what's Hell, the very dregs, the Ocean of that furie of which theſe are but ſmall drops? There it is that God will make the verie power of his hotteſt intolerable wrath to appear, and in thoſe rivers of brimſtone, thoſe ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing flames of his anger muſt thou lie down for ever: oh for ever, ever, man, think but awhile how long is that. Might but the undone Souls return, to deſcribe this place of torments to their old companions, what a Language ſhould we hear? Might but <hi>Dives</hi> himſelf have been ſent to his jovial Brethren, that little thought where their departed Brother was, nor what they themſelves were haſtning to, in what a paſſionate manner would he have beg'd them off from ſin, that led to all that endleſs Woe! How would he have diſturbed them in the midſt of their merriments and feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and even have made their hearts to quake, and their hair ſtand an end with his terrible expreſſions? But, <hi>Reader,</hi> if thou art one, who wilt be frightned from Hell by no deſcriptions, but of thoſe that have ſeen it, thy feeling is like to prevent thy fear. What ſay'ſt thou then after all? Art thou yet reſolved to prepare for Death, and prevent Damnation, or not? If thou art, happie man thou, that ever thou waſt born; but if thou art not, I can ſtay to ſay no more, but even take thy courſe, and when thou ſeeleſt the event, then ſay, <hi>Whether ſound Repentance, and an holy life, had not been a cheap and eaſie, a gainful and happy way, to have prevented ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting miſery.</hi> But the good Lord have mercie upon thee, and work theſe convictions with power upon thy ſoul, whilſt they may do thee any good.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I ſhall finiſh all with a word or two to all thoſe that trulie love and fear the Lord:</hi> Oh Sirs, You that have known God, and are intereſſed in his favor, and are well acquainted at the Throne of his Grace, to which you have oft in time of trouble and need made your recourſe, and thence have received ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable comfort and ſupply; All you to whom Prayer is no ſtrange work, Now ariſe and betake your ſelves to God with all ſeriouſneſs and ſpeed; Caſt your ſelves down before him, bewailing your own ſins, and the ſins of the Land; and lie in the gap to ſtop the farther proceedings of his wrath, that he may not root us up from being a people; nor yet ſo far give us off, that we ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to be a wicked and rebellious People; for then Deſtruction from the Lord will certainly be our Portion. Strive with him to remove his Rod, but above all, to work thoſe ends whereto it is appointed.</p>
            <p>I have endeavoured to ſhew you, and your ſelves are ſenſible of it, what ſins we are ſuffering for: Oh pray that everie abominable thing
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:54206:46"/>
may be caſt forth from amongſt us, and thoſe bleſſed works accompliſh't, which would make us in the eye of God and man a people glorious and happy. Beg earneſtly that the Goſpel may be advanc't, Holineſs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, Wickedneſs ſuppreſt and puniſh't, our Diviſions healed; that from the Prince upon the Throne, to the Beggar upon the Dunghill, there may be an effectual Reformation of all we have done amiſs; that we may yet find favour in the ſight of God, and enjoy his reſidence, and gracious preſence amongſt us; that he may delight in us, and rejoyce over us to do us good. Both alone, and in Companies, as you have opportunitie, beſiege Heaven with your humble and affectionate prayers. God will not be deaf to your cry, he knows your voice, which comes from your very Soul; he will not reject the Petitions you preſent with pure hands; your prayers are his delight, all you that are his humble, upright ones: 'Tis you muſt now prevail, or we are undone. Though you may be a people, hated, derided and undervalued by thoſe amongſt whom you live, yet muſt your interceſſions be accepted on their behalf, through our great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſor, or elſe they are like to periſh. 'Tis you that muſt run with your Cenſers, and ſtand betwixt the Living and the Dead, that ſo the Plague may be ſtayed. It is the incenſe and perfume of your prayers, that through Chriſt, muſt appeaſe an angrie God, and clear an infected Air. It is not the Lip<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ſervice of the profane ſinner, or the formal Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, that will do us anie good; let his prayers be by heart, or by rote, within-book, or without, that makes no great matter; but if he be one whoſe heart is far from God, and whoſe life is a provocation to him, who ſtill goes on in his ſin, let him be never ſo devout in the Church, or on his knees, and roar and weep with never ſo much paſſion and noiſe, the howling of a Dog is as acceptable to God, as ſuch hypocritical devotion. Shall the tongue that was juſt now Curſing and Swearing, come preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and fall a praying, and think to be accepted? Doth God delight to hear his Name taken in vain, as theſe ſenſleſs ſinners do in their ſolemneſt ſervices? No, no, but it is the fervent prayer of you who are indeed Righteous, that's like to be effectual and prevailing. You have the ſpirit of ſupplication interceding within you, aſſiſting you with unutterable ſighs and groans; whether with a Form, or without, makes not the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; and you have a powerful Advocate enforcing your Requeſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherefore to God betake your ſelves, lie at his feet. Plead with him for Rulers and People, his Church and Miniſters, your Friends and Enemies, City and Countrey, your Towns and Familie; and for your own Souls: Follow him day and night, and give him no reſt, till he ſhall hear in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and have mercy, and eſtabliſh his <hi>Zion</hi> a praiſe both amongſt us, and in the whole Earth.</p>

If it came to lead you forth to Execution indeed, you might well tremble; though not ſo much for its ſelf, as the errand it came on. Oh the ſtark madneſſe of thoſe blind and miſerable ones, that are afraid of a Plague, and not of Hell; that run away from the Sickneſſe, and run on in Sin? But talk not you of loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Sores? Why Sirs, do they go any deeper than your fleſh? Let thoſe that have made their Carcaſſes their care, be troubled for this? Why what have you any thing more for your bodies to do? Any ſervice for which you ſhall need them? And need you care, how the old clothes are rent and torn, ſo long as you ſhall never wear, nor need them more? Part willingly with your rags, you have clothes a making, which ſhall ſoon ſilence your complaints. Swell, and break, and ſtink fleſh if thou wilt, I ſhall not be troubled with thee long? When thou proſpereſt moſt, then I was at the worſt; thou haſt been ſo much my enemy, that I cannot but rejoyce in thy ruines? If my tongue muſt needs complain, and my ſight, and ſmell be offended with my ſelf, all this ſhall not reach my heart? What care I for thy Sores and Pains, ſo long as my Souls in health: Go make haſt, and get thee to thy Grave, and there turn to Rottenneſs and Filth? I pity thee not, nor will ever ſympathize with thee more.</p>
            <p>Nor yet complain of the Suddenneſſe of this Death. Leave this to them that would ſerve God, when they had nothing elſe to do, that put off all to a Lord have Mercie upon me; and a few good Prayers at their laſt gaſp. But what Death can be ſudden to you, who are not unprepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for Death; but have made it the buſineſſe of your lives, to fit your ſelves for it?</p>
            <p>Nor let this be your trouble that your Friends forſake you, and are all
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:54206:47"/>
afraid to come nigh you. Why what would you have them do, they cannot rebuke your Diſeaſe, or delay your Death, or doing any thing for you in the world you are going to; nor do you need they ſhould. Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel I hope you have given them in time of Health, and therefore it may the leſſe trouble you, that you cannot ſpeak to them now. To take a ſolemn leave of them, is a poor formality, to trouble the thoughts of a dying man. Whatever help they could afford, you'l quicklie be paſt all need of it, or them. Bear the want of their companie or aſſiſtance a day or two, and you will never deſire, or want it more. Wherefore chear up your Spirits, and be not caſt down, but to the Rock of Ages betake your ſelves, who never fail'd you, nor anie that placed their confidence in him; hee's a preſent help in time of trouble; hee'l come in to you when your doors are ſhut up, hee'l ſtand by your beds-ſide, when no other friend dare. Now Sirs, what's your God, your Saviour worth? A God to ſupport you, when the world fails you; A Saviour to relieve you, when you leave the world. Now is not an holy life comfortable to your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view? Do you now repent of the coſt and pains you have been at, or the ſufferings you have under-gone for God? Was it not worth while to be laught and wondered at for your holie diligence, which laid in ſtore for ſuch a day as this, and brings you ſupport, when the hearts of others ſink for fear? Now Sirs, you are come to the end of your Pilgrimage; the long-long-lookt for day is come. Sin and Satan, the world and the fleſh, ſhall never trouble you more for ever. Now ſhall your Prayers at length be all heard, your Complainings ended, your Expectations and Longings ſatisfied, and accompliſhed. Chear up, chear up, brave Souls, but one ſtep more, and then you are at your Fathers houſe. Methinks I ſee the Arms of Chriſt ſtretcht out to receive you, and Angels waiting to conduct you to his Arms. Fear not, nor be diſmaid, confidentlie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign your Souls to him, who laid down his life for you. The darkneſſe laſts but a little while, and preſentlie you will come into the open light; oh the difference you will in a moment find, betwixt your dark and ſilent room, and the manſion that ſhall be aſſigned you in your Fathers houſe! To which the ſtatelieſt Palace is a loathſom dungeon. Oh what Accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations and Hallelujahs, what crying, Holie, Holie, Holie! what Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Praiſes, and loud noiſes! What Crowns and Scepters, what Riches and Beauties, will your ears and eyes be preſentlie ſtricken with! So that you will be amazed, and wonder whether you are come, and where you have been all this while, that you never heard, nor ſaw theſe things before. So infinitelie will they exceed your higheſt thoughts, when Faith helpt you to the cleareſt views. But all your ſtrangeneſſe and amazement will ſoon
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:54206:48"/>
be over, Surpriſals of joy will diſſipate and ſucceed them! This is the Glorie, the hopes whereof upheld you all your daies, and the glimmerings and fore-taſts did ſo oft revive you. Now you ſhall at length ſee the Lord who lov'd you, and gave himſelf for you, and whom your Souls have loved. Oh is there not life in his ſmiles? And if he ſmiles upon you, all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Saints will bid you welcome: For his beck and pleaſure it is that rules all. There you ſhall be entred into that throng of Bleſſed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, yours ſhall their Employments be, their Priviledges ſhall be yours. Then ſhall your underſtandings be enlightened, your affections raiſed, and all your capacities widened, and all be fill'd with ſuitable truth and goodneſſe, the latent powers of your ſouls, ſhall then be awakened into that high Celeſtial Life. Then ſhall you be nearer to your Saviour, than <hi>John,</hi> when he leaned on his Boſome; and ſhall taſte the full fruits of his dear and coſtlie love. Then, then bleſſed Soul thou ſhalt know, and ſee, and feel, and enjoy thy God, and be brought as near to him as thy Soul can deſire, and receive as much from him as thy nature is capable.

This thou ſhalt have, but what this is, though I had leaſure and skill, to ſay ten thouſand times more then I have done, thou couldſt not know the thouſandth part, till thou doeſt enjoy it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with an holy impatience, and eager joy enter upon the poſſeſſion of all the Treaſures of Love, which Death comes to Tranſlate thee to. Bid it heartily welcome, open thy breaſt, and let it ſtrike; 'Tis but the prick of a Pin, the ſmarts ceaſt aſſoon as its in, the Pangs of it are gone in a trice. See they are over already, all pain was expired with that laſt groan, and now thou art entered upon thy Joy. <hi>Farewell Bleſſed Souls, whom I hope ſhortly to follow, and with you to celebrate an Everlaſting Communion, in the Preſence, Praiſe and Love of the Great Jehovah, and his Son Chriſt Jeſus, to whom in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Spirit, be rendred all Honour, Power, and Glory, now and Eternally.</hi>
