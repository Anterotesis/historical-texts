            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Account of the Flight, Diſcovery and Apprehending George Lord Geffries, Baron of <hi>Wemm,</hi> Lord Chancellor of <hi>England:</hi> Together With the Manner of his being Taken, Examination, and Commitment To the TOWER; On the 12th. of <hi>December</hi> 1688.</head>
            <p>UPon the News of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Approach, and the general Retreat and going over of the King's Forces, an extraordinary Council was held at <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall</hi> on <hi>Monday</hi> laſt, where, it is ſaid, the Lord Chancellor was preſent: But perceiving his Caſe deſperate, and the King's Intereſt not capable of ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, he, from the breaking up of that Council, retired himſelf from Buſineſs, and from any Converſation, ſtudying, as 'tis ſuppoſed, how and by what means to ſhift for his Saſety, and avoid the Storm (that he no doubt foreſaw) hanging over his Head, and on <hi>Tueſday</hi> morning he was no where to be found: So that it was conjectured he, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Notice of the King's Retiring, was endeavouring to make his Eſcape beyond the Seas. And ſo indeed it fell out: For having made over ſome of his Goods, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe diſpoſed of what he could with conveniency in ſo ſhort a time, he betook himſelf to find a Paſſage by Water, and in order thereto went down to <hi>Wapping,</hi> there waiting for the Opportunity in a Diſguiſe, contrary to his former florid Equipage. However he carry'd it not ſo ſecretly, but thoſe who pryed into ſuch Affairs, underſtanding a great quantity of Treaſure, and other things of Value were ſtowed in a Veſſel lying near the River ſide, it gave ſuſpition that ſomething more than ordinary was intended. Inſomuch that ſuſpecting it a Fraight no ways convenient for ſuch a Veſſel, it being ſaid to be a Collier, ſpoke ſo loud, that it came in Queſtion. And thereupon they apply'd themſelves to the Officers proper for that purpoſe, to Arreſt and Stay the ſaid Veſſel, till a further Account could be given. And though it was not ſpeedily done, nor without further Application, yet upon Search it was plainly perceived, that no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Perſon was concerned therein. However he had Notice, as it is conjectured, or at leaſt ſuſpected a Search, and Retired, in Diſguiſe, to a Houſe in <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Anchor</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley in <hi>Wapping,</hi> where, by the Vigilance of the Neighbours, he was this Day diſcovered through his Diſguiſe; and ſome Conſtables being called and conſulted, it was on all hands concluded, (ſince they had heard he was one of the principal Perſons proſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by the Prince of <hi>ORANGE,</hi> and Confederate Lords, as an Evil Counſellor, a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verter of the Laws, and Betrayer of the Liberties of the People) it was convenient to ſeize him, which they did without any Reſiſtance, between One and Two of the Clock, being then in a Furr Cap, a Seaman's Neckeloth, and a Ruſty Coat. So pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding to carry him before the Lord Mayor, they brought him into the City in a Coach guarded with Blunderbuſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> preceded by one Coach and followed by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; as alſo by a great Number of the Rabble, with shouts and Acc<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>tions. When coming to the Entrance of <hi>Grocer</hi>'s Hall, having then on an old Hat, inſtead of a Cap, he alighted, and was conducted thither, hanging down his Head, and ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſome Tears. And coming before the Lord Mayor, after a ſhort Examination, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and a Repaſt for Refreſhment, he was committed to the Tower in the charge of a ſtrong Guard, where re remains to expect the Iſſue.</p>
