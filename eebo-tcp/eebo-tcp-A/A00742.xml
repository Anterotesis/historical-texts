         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and in no place vnworthy of a

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:2153:4"/>
of iudgments, in one and the ſame
ſort, both which be in danger, the former of
ſchiſmes to grow to hereſies, the latter from
ſome difference of iudgement, to bee ſorted

this, which ſhortlie, and, as it were vnder

pointes of our moſt holy faith, the
iudgment of men be not either called home,
where it is broken out, or ſtayed where a
breach is begun. And albeit th'excellent vſe
hereof may clearly appeare to euery one that
hath but halfe an eye to looke with: yet is
there that oppoſition in the world against
all good endeuours of the ſeruauntes of the
God of heauen, that this alſo is not vnlike to
fall into ſome riflers hands, which will doe
the vttermoſt of his wretched endeuour, to
deſpoile it of the garmentes of comelines,
whereby the Lorde would ſet it in the good
grace &amp; well liking of his children. If (hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelie)

Maiſter <hi>Dudley Fenner,</hi> it were ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
anſwere, that the ſame is made Engliſh,
which before was Latine, and brought into
the artificers ſhop, which was before in the
ſtudies &amp; cloſets of the learned alone, which
deſerueth praiſe at the handes of a thankful
Reader. It is more then ſufficient aunſwere,
that he hath brought M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Fenners</hi> booke,
for helpe of memorie, into a great deale
ſmaller rowme. But I am and haue bene of
that acquainta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; priuitie with the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
theſe many years, that I am able be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

vpon him. And therefore as the Lord gaue
Maiſter <hi>Fenner</hi> the honour to be firſt; ſo he
would not let him haue it ſo farre, as to be
alone. And notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding th'authors both
modestie, and wiſedome is ſuch, as he would
not haue paſſed by the aduantage of a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
garniſhment of his worke, by M. <hi>Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi>
labours: yet whoſoeuer ſhall peruſe
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:2153:5"/>
the booke diligentlie, ſhall eaſilie perceaue,
that hee hath for the matter, a ſtock of his
own, and for the forme &amp; maner of deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of it, art and cunning of his own, to haue
finiſhed ſome commendable worke in this
kind, if he had had no ſuch paterne before
his eyes. Which beeing well conſidered, will
ſtop the mouth of ſome others, which ſnat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching

them, they know not where, nor at whome.
And for my parte, I am of that iudgement,
that it is ſo farre from beeing vnmeet for a
Gentleman of the Innes of the Court, to
deale thus in theſe holy ſtudies; that I could
wiſh of the Lorde, that the Noble men of
the Court it ſelfe, and all others whoſe wits
are either by nature, or education more
pregnant, would fine &amp; file them vpon ſuch
endeuours as theſe are. So ſhould they fitt

of the comon wealth, then <hi>Machiauel</hi> that

many notable draughts of policie, here
and there ſcattered throughout the whole
Scripture, eſpecially the ſtorie: that one
booke of the Prouerbes, as it were the Lords
owne Politickes, is able to yeelde more ſound
precepts of ſure &amp; ſafe gouernement, then,
I will not ſaye <hi>Machiauell,</hi> but then all
the <hi>Machiauels</hi> in the worlde, when they
ſhall haue met vpon their bench, and ſhall
haue beaten out their braines about that
conſultation. And if it be here aſked, what
are you, or who are you, whoſe iudgment in
this behalfe the reader ſhould ſo greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard.
Peraduenture the reader may be ſuch

my word I ſhould carie him away, although
I brought no reaſon: if of no note at all, hee

And if Scepters were wel guided,
when men ſtoode at the ſterne of common

that ſhadowe and carcaſe of Philoſophie,
that was to be had in their bookes: O howe

I ſee there would be no end if I ſhould ſet my

And therfore aſſured of the fruitfulneſſe
of the booke in it ſelfe, I commend the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
and ſucces therof to the bleſsing of God:
who only can direct the heartes and handes

For which cauſe Exod. 20. 17. the wyfe of our neighbour (his moſt precious poſſeſſion, prou. 19. 14) commeth not in the firſt place but is ſet in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> middeſt of other poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, that the verie marſhaling of the wordes it might appeare that this commandement reacheth not to vncleannes. 4 The order of the commandements, going by degrees from the greater to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leſſe, and ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually falling til you come to this ſumme of <hi>Coueting,</hi> which is the roote of all the reſt, 1. Tim. 6. 10. 5 It differeth in nature from the two laſt that went before. Whereof one is bent againſt iniurie and wronge, the other againſt falſitie and deceipt. And this commeth not ſo farre as eyther of them both. Laſtlie, adde herevnto that whiche I hould as a certaine grounde, that the corruption both of nature &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire is forbidden in euerie one. For the Law of God, and conſequenthe euerie commandement thereof, being ſpirituall, Rom. 7. 14. (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the nature of him that gaue it, Iohn 4 24. Heb 4. 12. 13.) muſt needes reach to all the faculties and powers of the whole man, yea and to his very nature. So as in euery commandement the roote it ſelfe and ſtumpe of that ſinne, togither with all the braunches comming from it, are there condemned. Which ſeeing all men agree, in dueties of the firſt table, the ſame reaſon and proportion earieth it to thoſe of the ſeconde alſo. And that may further appeare by our Sauiour Chriſtes interpretation of the ſeuenth commandement, extending it to all kinde of luſt, Mat. 5. 28. So doeth the Apoſtle Iames the ſixt commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſetting it foorth by the three degrees thereof <hi>lusting, eagerly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting,</hi> (when the heart is wholy poſſeſſed with it) and laſtly <hi>fighting</hi> and <hi>warring</hi> Iames 4. 2. As for the ſaying of Paul, Rom. 7. 7. <hi>I had not known lust, except the Law had ſaid, Thou ſhalt not luſt,</hi> I take it (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der reformation of better iudgment) to be meant not of any one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment in particuler, but of the whole puritie (that way) which the Lawe of God thoroughout requireth. And that aſwell in the duties to God, as to our brethren. Which the Apoſtle ſoundly gathereth to bee commaunded in the Law, <hi>becauſe the Law is ſpirituall.</hi> And this hee ſaith (verſe 9) came and was, as it were, a new commaundement vnto him, when he vnderſtood the whole Law to be ſpirituall and to reach to the luſt and deſire of the heart. which in the darkenes of his phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaiſme hee had not learned. Becauſe this expoſition of the tenth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, doth vary from that which is generally receaued, I haue opened my reaſons the more at large. Let the learned Iudge.</p>

Which is two fould, according to the diuerſe diſpenſation of the times before and ſince his comming. The couenant of grace before his comming in the fleſhe (being thorough Chriſt to come) was termed <hi>the old Teſtament,</hi> Heb. 8. 13. and the publiſhing thereof, the promiſe, Acts 13. 32.

                     <p>The difference betweene the Lawe and the Goſpell ſtandeth in theſe three things. 1. The Lawe offereth ſaluation vnder condition of perfect obedience, that is to ſay, if wee doe it: the Goſpell vnder condicion of faith, that is to ſay, if we beleeue, Rom. 10. 5, 6. 2. The Law comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth only, but giueth no power to performe it, and therfore is called the <hi>dead letter, written with inke</hi> and <hi>in tables of ſtone</hi> to be read and ſeene, but hauing no life in it to change the heart, which remaineth as <hi>ſtonie</hi> as before.

            <p>THE LORDES
Prayer, deliuered
by our Sauiour
Chriſt as a paterne
to frame all our
Prayers by, conteyneth a moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
and perfect direction, aſwell
for the circumſtances to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in praying, as for the matter it
ſelf of our prayer.</p>
            <p>The circumſtances are theſe:
1 To God only through Chriſt.
For neither<note n="a" place="margin">Math. 23. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Father in Heauen but him alone,
<pb facs="tcp:2153:31"/>
neither is hee our <hi>Father</hi> but in
Chriſt.</p>
            <p>2 Praeparation: taught by vſing
of a praeface.</p>
            <p>3 Faith, particularly applying
to our ſelues the loue of GOD in
Chriſt. <hi>Our Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4 Confidence, as a childe goeth
bouldly to his <hi>Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5 Reuerence of his Maieſtie,
<hi>Who is in Heauen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6 Zeale &amp; earneſtnes in prayer;
that all our affections be taken vp,
and wholy bent vpon it. Which
the ſhortneſſe of the prayer tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth,
and the concluding of it
with this worde, <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. A greater feruency of Spirite
<pb facs="tcp:2153:31"/>
in praying for the things that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
Gods glory, then for thoſe
that concerne our own good, yea
though it bee the ſaluation of our
ſoules. As appeareth by the order
of the petitions, and in that thoſe
firſt three are without any cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling
bonde at all, which the latter
three haue. Againe of the things
which concerne our owne good,
greater zeale and feruency to bee
ſhewed for heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly things which
the three latter Petitions doe aſke
by name, then for earthly thinges
that are ſought but as additaments
and appendancies to the other.</p>
            <p>8 A fellow-feeling and loue one
vnto an other, <hi>Our Father, our bread,
our treſpaſſes, lead vs not deliuer vs, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9 An aſſurance of obteyning
the thinges wee pray for. Earthlie
thinges with condition, ſo farre as
<pb facs="tcp:2153:32"/>
God hath appointed them for our
good. All other abſolutely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
condition. Which aſſurance
is noted in the word, <hi>Amen</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
that not only ſo we deſire it
may be, but that ſo vndoubtedly it
is and ſhalbe. Wherevnto we are
induced, both by conſideration of
the loue of God, our <hi>Father,</hi> &amp; of
his power, which is in <hi>Heauen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, continuance in prayer,
<hi>giue vs this day,</hi> Euery day renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our ſupplications.</p>
            <p>So much of the circumſtances.
The matter is partly in petition, &amp;
partly in thankeſgiuing, The peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are ſix in number. All in that
courſe and order as the doctrine
before was handled. Whereof the
firſt three are of thoſe thinges that
belong to Gods glorie without
any reſpect of our owne good, As
the particle, <hi>thy,</hi> in euery one doth
<pb facs="tcp:2153:32"/>
ſhew. And this one thing, wherin
the ſoundeſt Diuines agree, being
well obſerued, bringeth a great
light for the diſtinguiſhing of all
the ſix Petitions according to their
proper boundes and limits, in ſuch
ſort as hereafter followeth.</p>
            <p>The firſt Petition,<note place="margin">I. PETITI. <hi>GOD. his</hi> Eſſence. Perſons. Perfection.</note>

no iote nor reſemblance of
good in any creature but that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
which they haue fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thee, who
art the Father of lights.</p>
            <p>And this reſpecteth the firſt part
of Theologie, which is of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
perſons, and properties of
the Godhead.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Petition,<note place="margin">2. PETIT. <hi>The KING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DOME of God in his</hi>

all perſons and creatures (although

the mountaines of braſſe, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

            <p>And this reſpecteth the ſecond
braunch of Theologie, touching
the kingdome of God, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation
of his counſells.</p>
            <p>The third petition,<note place="margin">3. PETIT. <hi>The HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NOVR due to God. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by</hi> Angells. Sainctes in Heauen. The Church vpon earth.</note>

to preferre the loue they beare to
thee, before the loue of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues,
their own pleaſure, profit, or liues,
or whatſoeuer els that is moſt dear
vnto them.</p>
            <p>And this (which is the thirde
braunch of Theologie) riſeth by
a neceſſarie conſequence from the
former two. For he that is in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
and in his workes ſo glorious,
is worthy and alone worthie to be
honored and ſerued of vs.</p>
            <p>The three latter Petitions are of

whereof the firſt (being the fourth

<note place="bottom">
                  <p>of God, fall afterwards to his adioyntes of kingdome and honour: ſo theſe beginne with Chriſt and regeneration through him, the fruites whereof are Iuſtification and Sanctification which followe in their place. As the Apoſtle, agreeably herevnto reduceth all the benefits we haue by Chriſt to thoſe three heades, and that in the ſame order. 1 Iohn 5. 8. <hi>There be three which heare record in earth. The Spirite,</hi> wherein we are regenerate: water, wherby we are waſhed and clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from our ſinne; And <hi>Blood,</hi> purging and aboliſhing both the roote and the fruites of it. Which is attributed to the blood of Chriſt, Heb. 9. 14. 1 Iohn. 1. 7, 9. And that it is ſo to bee taken in this place, not for expiation, I gather by that the Apoſtle ſaith verſ. 6 <hi>This is hee that came by water and blood, not by water only, but water and blood.</hi> That is to ſay, not our Iuſtifier onely which all men doe willinglie embrace: but to ſanctifie vs alſo, which men will not ſo eaſily bee brought to yeeld vnto.</p>
                  <p>4. Seeing it is plaine that in aſking pardon of our ſinnes and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in Chriſt (which we do in the fifth petition) Conſequently we aſke all the belſſednes belonging to it. One part whereof is this, to haue all outward things as additaments and appendancies caſt vnto vs, ſo farre as God hath appointed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for our good, as our Sauiour Chriſtes both ſpeech and promiſe is, Mat. 6. 33. and further then that we haue no warrant to deſire them; it ſeemeth not ſo likely that either our Sauiour Chriſt would rent theſe thinges aſunder and tranſplant one from another, or in ſo ſhort a ſumme admit of repetition, which muſt needes follow if being there included we aſke them here by name. And this alſo may ſerue to proue that no defect or may me ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> iuſtly be imputed to this abſolute forme of prayer, though outward things come not within compaſſe of the fourth petition.</p>
                  <p>5. The doubling of the article <gap reason="foreign">
