         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </list>
            <div n="1" type="part">
               <head>But to the firſt in order.</head>
               <p n="1">1. He denyed Jeſus Chriſt to be the Son of
God by an eternal generation.</p>
               <p>That which they undertook to maintain in this
particular was, the eternal generation of the
Son by the Father in the Godhead, which was
and is by me denyed; the Scripture they had at
firſt to prove it, was that in the Common-pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
book, in <hi>Athanaſius</hi> Creed: That he was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
God of very God, begotten before all worlds;
I denyed that to be Scripture; they affirmed it
to be in the Scripture; I told them I knew no
ſuch Scripture, and deſired them to look it;
they ſearched the Scripture, turned their
Concordance, but could not find it; I then
told them where they might find it; but in the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:169856:4"/>
ſecond meeting they produced theſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
<hi>John 3. 16. God ſo loved the world,
that he gave his only begotten Son;</hi> and <hi>John
1. 14. 1 John 4. 9. He ſent his only begotten,
that we might live, &amp;c.</hi> and hence endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to maintain this argument, that if Chriſt
was the only begotten, then he was eternally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,
&amp;c. that I denyed; for he is not ſaid to
be begotten<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but as in the womb of the Virgin,
by the power of the moſt high. <hi>Luke</hi> 1. and
upon this accouut he is ſaid to be the only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
Son of the Father, becauſe there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
any ſon ſo begotten; they ſtill preſſed this
argument<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that this begetting muſt of neceſſity
be a begetting before all time: I anſwered them
out of <hi>Pſal 2. 7. Thou art my ſon, this day have
I begotten thee,</hi> which is a begetting in time:
they then fell to that in <hi>Prov. 8. 25. Before the
mountains were ſetled, before the hils was I brought
forth;</hi> hence endeavouring to maintain an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
begetting, which was denyed: bringing forth
and begetting being not the ſame; although af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the fleſh begetting precedes bringing forth;
yet in the Divine myſtery there is a bringing
forth without begetting; in concluſion I char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
Perſon <hi>Smith</hi> with blaſphemy and nonſence;
blaſphemy in holding forth a generation in the
Godhead, which is proper only to the creature;
and nonſence in holding forth a generation in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:169856:5"/>
the Godhead, the Father begetting the Son, and
yet the Son to be coeternal, and that it was him
that indeed denyed the eternity of the Son.</p>
               <p>I ſhall further declare my underſtanding in this
myſtery.</p>
               <p>Chriſt as the Son relating to the Divine being,
was and is that wiſdom which was before the
mountains and hils, <hi>viz.</hi> that wiſdom, power,
light, love, &amp;c. which lay hid in ſilence in the
Father, and was the Father before the Creation,
yet lay hid, <hi>viz.</hi> not made manifeſt to any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
but in the Creation put forth and made
manifeſt, as likewiſe in the preſervation, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
in the reſtauration and drawing up of
ſouls into ſpiritual union &amp; fellowſhip ſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
in the man Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>John</hi> 1. 1, 2, 3. with
<hi>verſe</hi> 14. Here is a bringing forth of that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
which was in the Father from eternity, into
viſible manifeſtation to the Creation; but laſt
and ſpecially to thoſe made partakers of that
birth from above, <hi>John</hi> 3. 3. ſo that that wiſdom
brought forth is not ſomething begotten by the
Father, but the bringing forth of that word of
wiſdom and power which was before all begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
with God, in God, and is God: ſo that to
conclude this particular, I neither did nor do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
the eternity of the Son, but the generation
as relating to the Divine being. To the ſecond.</p>

               <head>2. He denyed a local heaven.</head>
               <p>In this I denyed heaven to be a particular li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
place, I acknowledged that heaven muſt
have ſome place; for that which hath no place,
hath no being; but that as far as I know its not
a limited place; that is, ſome place of glory a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the firmament, as is imagined; but that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
relates rather to a condition of glory, then
a place of glory; and its not the place but the
condition which makes either heaven or hell. He
<hi>viz.</hi> Parſon <hi>Smith,</hi> proceeds to proof; produces
that of <hi>Paul</hi> being in the third heaven, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.
I asked him if he thought that <hi>Paul</hi> was taken up
above the Starry firmament; he anſwered yea,
for he knew no other heaven: I anſwered, I
knew another heaven, which Chriſt ſpeaks of,
which is within, and doubtleſs this is the heaven
the Apoſtle was in: The higheſt manifeſtations
and injoyment of the Lord, ſo high, that he
knew not himſelf, whether in the body, or out of
the body; that this is the truth, appears in that
he is not ſpeaking of being tranſported perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
into ſuch a high place as is imagined, for he is
ſpeaking of viſions and revelations ſo high, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly

he were in or out of the body. He produced <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>

it to be the inviſible glory of Father

you by right hand? that is an expreſſion
rather to declare the glory of Chriſt, then the
place; and that which I underſtood by right hand,
was and is the enojoyment of the Fathers love,
of the Fathers glory; at his right hand are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
for evermore; the apprehenſions of wrath
and anger is the left hand, &amp;c. ſo that heaven
which <hi>Steven</hi> ſaw open, was the glorious open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and unfoldings of the Father and Son, whom
to behold in love is life; and then was a time for
<hi>Steven</hi> to ſee the heavenly glory of the Father
and Son in a ſpeciall manner when under ſuch a
trial for the profeſſion of them.</p>
               <p>One Parſon <hi>Fearn</hi> ſtands up, and preſt Parſon
<hi>Smith</hi> to ſay ſomething in confirmation of the
point in hand for the ſatisfaction of the people,
which put him the more to a ſtand; then the
ſaid Parſon <hi>Fearn</hi> produced that Scripture, <hi>Col.</hi>
3. 1. <hi>If ye be riſen with Chriſt, ſeek thoſe things
which are above, where Chriſt ſitteth at the right

               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:169856:6"/>
I anſwered, that this Scripture held forth no
local, but a ſpiritual heaven; for the heaven here
is that into which ſaints are already riſen into;
if riſen with him, then above with him, beholding
the glory of the Son with the Father, ſeeking
things which are ſutable to ſuch a condition, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
the Son ſhall appear in his brightneſs; then
ſhall they appear with him in glory, <hi>verſe</hi> 4. for
they ſhall ſee him as he is, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 3.</p>
               <p>They ask where heaven is, if not a particular
place? I anſwer, as in relation to God its every
where, he being in all places, yet never out of
the perfection of glory, therefore never out of
heaven; as in relation to the Creature, its every
where, where the heavenly light and love is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt,
and the ſoul taken into union with it: He
asked if I would bring heaven and hell together?
whether heaven was in hell? I anſwered, yea, it
is in hell; you grant that God is in hell, then
certainly heaven is there; for God is never out of
the heavenly glory; farther, two perſons may be
in one place, the one in heaven the other in hell;
the one in the injoyment of love and grace, the
other in the apprehenſion of wrath and anger;
experience declares the truth of this; and thus
may it be in another world to eternity, ſeeing
its not the place, but the condition which makes
the difference: Again, heaven and hell, light and
darkneſs, joy and ſorrow, may be in one heart,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:169856:7"/>
yet the light ſtill diſtinguiſhed from the darkneſs,
hell and heaven diſtinguiſhed, and at a diſtance
each from other.</p>

This was that which I denyed, affirming that the
Redemption and Salvation of man flows ſingly

Chriſt came forth from the Father, did the work
of the Father, was upheld and carryed through
by the Father; for ſaith Chriſt, John 5. 19. <hi>The

the world that he gave his Son,</hi> Joh. 3. 16. So that
Chriſt is the manifeſtation of the Fathers love; To

ſon, give him the money, that ſo he might pay
it you again ſatisfie your word, and free the
debtor; then you ſend a meſſenger to inform
him that the debt is paid, and his peace is made:
So God having ſaid, <hi>In the day thou eateſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

to ſatisfie the word of his Truth, and to reſtore
fallen man, gives forth his Son, that ſo the Son

the Father in the Son ſatisfieth his Word, which
is his divine Juſtice, and maketh peace with the

from that Law,</hi> ver. 4. <hi>wherefore my brethren ye alſo
are become dead to the Law by the body of Chriſt, that
ye ſhould be married to another;</hi> that as a woman
is dead to the law of her husband, ſo are believers
dead to the Law; and as a woman is at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to marry with another, and then is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the Law of that husband; even ſo believers,
being married to Chriſt, live to him, are ſubject
to him, that ſo they might bring forth fruit unto
God. At this Scripture he was at a ſtand; I preſt
him to anſwer the Scripture; he refuſed, ſaying,
I brought Scriptures which were not to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
nor have any tendency to the thing in hand;
and would not anſwer it; thus thinking to ſhift
out when he could not anſwer: But I deſired
him then that he would give the meaning of that
Scripture to the people, that ſo they might be
ſatisfied in the truth of it, if I did miſapply it; he
endeavouring to wind out, refuſed; but being
earneſtly preſſed to it, he anſwered, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
believers were made partakers of
Chriſt, yet the Law was holy and juſt and good.
I told him it was a truth, but nothing to the truth
intended in that Scripture, and deſired him ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:169856:14"/>
to ſpeak to that Scripture; he then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
that believers were freed from the rigor
of the Law: I anſwered again, that in ſubſtance
he granted what I affirmed; for if believers be
not under the rigor, then they are not under
the command; for its the command which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
the rigor: the tranſgreſſion of the Law
occaſions the rigor. I farther produced 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.
where it is ſaid, <hi>the Law is done away and aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
ver. 11. and 13. and its the Moral Law thats
there intended, as appears <hi>verſe 7. It was that
which was written and ingraven in ſtone:</hi> He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
that it was true that the miniſtry of the
Law was done away, but not the Law; it is the
miniſtration of it that is there intended: I asked
him then, why he did preach the Law &amp; plead for
it, if the miniſtration of it was done away? the
truth is, that as the miniſtration of it, as it is death,
ſo the miniſtry of it is to work up ſouls into its
righteouſnes for deliverance from death; ſo in
the Goſpel, though a Goſpel of grace and peace;
yet thoſe who reject it ſhall be damned; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is the miniſtry accompanied with it for the
working up of ſouls into its grace and peace.
If it be objected, that the Law was never given
that men might ſeek or obtain life in it, but
Chriſt was life then as well as now. I anſwer, its
truth, the Law was in it ſelf a miniſtration of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:169856:14"/>
death, and not of life; yet under that diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the wiſdome and way of God was ſuch to his
people, as that they firſt looking into that Law,
ſeeing how far ſhort of life they came in their
not performing of it, might look above unto
that righteouſneſs which was preſented in it,
much like unto the fiery and braſen ſerpent;
the one bites, the other cures; and this was the
conſtant way and courſe of the Lords communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
himſelf unto his people; but now the
manner of the diſpenſation is changed, and all
things are made new: the way of God to his
people is firſt, to bring them into view of his
goodneſs, and to poſſeſs them with his love, and
then from the ſame principle and power of love
gives forth a Law within, a Law without, which
is a Law of love, in which there is no condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to them who walk not after the Law of
<hi>Moſes,</hi> but the Law of Chriſt; not the Moral
Law in the hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but the Law of grace
in the hand of Chriſt, who ſerve not after the
Law of a carnal command, but after the power
of an endleſs life; not in the oldneſs of the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but in the newneſs of the ſpirit. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
he asked me what was the difference then
between the Law in the hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the
the Law in the hand of Chriſt? I anſwered, as
much as between life and death; in the one the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:169856:15"/>
miniſtration of death, in the other the miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of life: if the miniſtration of death was glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
how much more ſhall the miniſtration of
the Spirit exceed in glory?</p>
               <p>Thus my noble friends, have I given ſome brief
hints of the ſubſtance of the Diſcourſe, paſſing
by thoſe many vain and antick behaviours, which
would be a ſhame to repeat in perſons pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for truth and honeſty; and this I leave with
you as my apprehenſions in the things declared.
Let thoſe who have the ſpirit of light and truth
judge; for the ſpiritual man judgeth all things,
though he himſelf be judged of no man.</p>
