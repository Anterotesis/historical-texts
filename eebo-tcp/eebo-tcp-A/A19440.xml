            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Therefore when you haue learned them, then may you set foorth the prayse and glory of God in such sort, as he shall like of, but otherwyse it is vnpossible you should: for notwithstanding <hi>Moses</hi> was brought vp in all the<note place="margin">Actes. 7. 22.</note> learning of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> yet he confesseth him selfe to be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant<note place="margin">Exod. 10. 26.</note> concerning the worshyp of the Lord, vntyll such time as he shoulde be directed by his owne most perfect worde: How much more then ought we to confesse great ignorance therein, vntil such time as we also shal be directed by the same. Moreouer, for as much as no prayse or worshyp is accepted in the sight of the Lord, but such as shalbe done according to the rule thereof, we must learne to worshyp him according to the same, &amp; in no case to go one foote farther. For as <hi>Moses</hi> was not to do any thyng about the Tabernacle, or for the geuing of lawes, statutes, ordinances, rites, ceremonies, or whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, according to his owne wyl or fantasie: but in all thinges<note place="margin">Exodus. 25. 40 and.

For doth not our<note place="margin">Math. 22. 29. and. 15. 9.</note> Sauiour say? Ye erre, not knowing the Scriptures: but are intangled with the preceptes and doctrines of men. Euen so is the worlde now, for the <hi>Papist</hi> he is so perswaded of his Writers, that he thinkes there is no other trueth but what they write, and vpon them he onely buyldes his Fayth, and<note place="margin">Flat agaynst the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God.</note> leaues the Scripture altogether, and in no case may the simplier sort therein looke, or reade: and we also like wyse men, deale in a maner after the same sort.

weake in fayth, and greatly troubled in conscience at the thinges then happened: and yet like good Christians confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and talking together, with a desire to knowe the trueth, as all men ought to do: I say our Sauiour dealt in like sort with them. For <hi>S.

And furthermore you see, that euen that eloquent man <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollos,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Actes. 18. 24. the ende.</note> who had taught diligently the thinges of the Lorde, in a kinde not altogether vnprofitable: yet was contented to be taught by a couple of meane persons, to come to a more perfect way of teaching, then before he had vsed: And that was, to proue and shewe mightily, as he did, by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that <hi>IESVS</hi> was the <hi>CHRIST.</hi> So that you see these Guydes did not sende their doubtfull Schollers to this, or that mans booke to finde out Christ: but they founde him out, and taught him by the Scriptures. Nay you see that <hi>Apollos</hi> did not teache the right way to finde him out, vntyll he tooke that course to teach him by: and then <hi>S. Luke</hi> tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth you, that he mightily confuted all gayne-sayers. For so strong and mightie is the worde of God in operation, that if it be rightly expounded, or propounded, it is sharper then any two edged sworde, and entreth through, euen to the deuiding<note place="margin">Hebrew. 4. 12.</note> a sunder of the very hart and soule of the hearers thereof, as the Apostle sayth.

Yours, how diligent you ought to be in reading of the holy Scriptures, and also conferring of Christ, and his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: And your Guydes, what course they ought to take in teaching of you, when as you shall demande to be resolued of your doubtes: and that is, to teache you Christ by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and thyther to sende you to finde him out your selfe, and not els where: for no where els is he rightly to be found.

The answere is, that yf you wyll you may: but yf it be for matters of saluation, the Booke of God is the onely Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries shoppe for you to resort vnto, because there you may be sure to haue a most precious medicine for euery disease, or curing salue for euery sore. And surely the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> found it so to be: for sayth he, I had euen perished in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest<note place="margin">Psalm. 119. 92</note> of mine afflictions, had not the booke of God been my delyght: and therefore made he that his only meditation both day and nyght. So that when you haue bestowed long time, with lyke delight and diligence therein, as he did, and that your wittes thereby are quickened, so that you may be well able to discerne of Spirites, that is, betwixt good and euyll: then you may, if your leysure serue you, reade other Bookes and catch no hurt. Or yf it be so that you haue not as yet heard of the Booke of God, you may also reade some bookes, and take no harme: for some Bookes there are which are good, and tende to very good purpose, because their dryft is (as I suppose) to draw you to the Booke of God, euen to that fountayne of all ioy: but otherwyse, yf their drift be to draw
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:16926:10"/>
your delight vnto them selues, they can in no wyse be good. For <hi>Iohn the Baptist</hi> being tolde that more Disciples follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed<note place="margin">Iohn. 3. 26. to the ende.</note> Christ, then followed him, he taketh them selues to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes that he had tolde them plainely, that him selfe was not the <hi>Christ,</hi> but that he was sent to shew them which was he: and hauing once shewed him vnto them, that he him selfe was then to ceasse: and therfore when he heard that all men ran to Christ, he sayth, that then was his only ioy fulfilled, because in deede that was his onely drift and purpose. So that yf any man write to that ende, as of late most learnedly one hath done, in a lytle Booke called a <hi>Consent of Scripture:</hi> you are to be thankefull vnto God for such a one, and when he, or any other, haue by their wrytinges, thus led you vnto Christ, in saying, Come and see the Booke of God: for there we haue<note place="margin">Iohn. 1. 39. 41 45. 46.

Againe, some Bookes there are which in respect of the holy stories conteined in the Booke of God, we cal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Stories, as the <hi>Macchabees, Iosephus,</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> stories: the which prophane stories yf you reade, you may learne thereby (yf you know the Scriptures before) how iust the Lord is in all his sayinges, because that some Prophecies in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy Scriptures there are, whose euent is not altogether in Scripture shewed, and yet by those Prophane stories you may see they tooke effect: as namely the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> and also the <hi>Reuelation</hi> of <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> the which by eye sight we are also able to witnes, how that Booke is fulfilled by the <hi>Popes</hi> in all their dealinges. But yf you thinke that you can not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne vnto perfect wysedome, and knowledge of Christe, without the helpe of other Books, then are you greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued: for the Worde of God is an absolute perfect rule,<note place="margin">2.

Christ, without the helpe of any other, and is also playne and easie of it selfe for your vnderstanding: yf you wyll the Lord<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 130.</note> beleeue, as I sayde before, especially yf you wyll come in sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie of hart, and cast off your owne wysedome: for in very deede, that is the onely hinderance of the attayning thervnto. Agayne, some Bookes there are which take vpon them to lay downe preceptes for your lyfe &amp; conuersation, which bookes, yf you thinke you are bounde to read as well as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, then are you also as greatly deceiued: for the Lord hath commaunded you vpon payne of damnation, to reade the<note place="margin">Ioshua. 1. 8. Iohn. 5. 39. and. 3. 36. Deutro. 32. 47.</note> Scripture, because in deede it is the very lyfe and norish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your soule: but as for the reading of such kinde of Bookes, you haue no such charge, neyther was it needefull for you so to haue, because there is nothing that the hart of man can thinke on, eyther for vertue to imbrace, or vice to eschew, but the Booke of God doth contayne a rule, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept for it: and therefore, what neede we the helpe of man to lay downe preceptes for our lyfe, when as the Lorde him selfe hath taken vppon him to be our Guyde, and Teacher. Therefore in the name of God, take heede of the subtiltie of Satan, in this poynt aboue all others: that is, that he deceiue you not so herein, as to make you beleeue that you shall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne vnto as great wysedome or holynes, by the wrytinges of men, as you shall do by the booke of God: or that the booke of God is not perfect of it selfe, to instruct you fully in all thinges touching your saluation: for then hath he you euen as he woulde: therefore rather then he shoulde make you so to thinke, better were it for you with them of <hi>Ephesus</hi> to<note place="margin">Actes. 19. 19.</note> burne them all, yea though the price of all such Bookes were founde to be in value worth fiftie thousande peeces of siluer. And God doth know, a most heynous sinne it is, and reigneth most abundantly amongst vs here in Englande, euen this, that we esteeme a great deale more of the preceptes and doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of men, then we do of the Booke of God: so that, as that hath been the very cause of the destruction of all the worlde, greatly it is to be feared, least the lyke plague wyll befall vs, and our Nation: for how fewe haue we that doth

take so great delight in the booke of God, as to make it the chiefe ioy, and reiocing of their hartes, as the Prophet <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie</hi>

               <p>Now it may be that you wyll aske me agayne, What<note place="margin">A Question.</note> part of the Scripture it is, that you were best to reade? The answere is, euen all: for so you may learne by the last Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of our Sauiour, that I spake of: for be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth to search the Scriptures: so that al which is called Scripture you must search, for all that doth testifie of him. And so you see <hi>S. Luke</hi> sayth, he began at <hi>Moses</hi> and all the<note place="margin">Luke. 24. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>Prophetes,</hi> that is, from the beginning of <hi>Genesis</hi> to the ende of <hi>Malachie</hi> for the old Testament, which only then was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: and all that was nothing els, but to teach Christ: And now you haue also the new Testament, which tendeth to none other ende then the former did, and that is, to teache Christ. For so the Apostle sayth, I taught nothing, but what<note place="margin">Actes. 26. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Prophetes</hi> did say shoulde come. And in an other place, I kept nothing backe, but haue shewed you all<note place="margin">Actes. 20. 27.</note> the counsell of God: and what was that? To wit, that Christ shoulde suffer, and that he shoulde be the fyrst that shoulde<note place="margin">Actes. 26. 23.</note> rise from the dead, and shoulde shewe lyght vnto the people, and to the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> So that you may see, that all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture tendeth to none other purpose, but to teach you that: and therefore you must of necessitie reade all, that so you may, as <hi>S. Luke</hi> sayth, Acknowledge the certaintie of those thinges whereof you haue been instructed, not onely by the <hi>Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listes,</hi> and the <hi>Apostles,</hi> who haue declared vnto you the thinges of Christe, from the day that <hi>Zacharias</hi> went into the Temple, and that the <hi>Angell</hi> tolde <hi>Marie</hi> concerning her conception: but also what you haue been instructed by <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Prophetes,</hi> euen from the day that he was first promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that so you may be able to deliuer the glory thereof from
<pb facs="tcp:16926:12"/>
poynt to poynt, and to stande firme your selfe, agaynst all the assaultes of the Deuyll.</p>
               <p>Yea but you wyll say agayne, <hi>S. Paule,</hi> of whom you<note place="margin">An other Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection.</note> spake before, forbids vs Genealogies, and commaundes that we shal geue no heede vnto them, because they are endles,<note place="margin">1. Timo. 1. 4.</note> and breede questions, rather then godly edifiyng, which is by fayth: And so in deede a great number of our Guydes wyll tell vs. For many times because we fynd them very hard, we go to them to aske the meaning thereof: then their answere is, that the Genealogies tende not to edification, but rather to strife and contention, and therefore is it that <hi>S. Paule</hi> forbiddes them. And so likewyse for many other harde places in the Bible, when we goe to aske them (whose<note place="margin">Mala. 2. 7.</note> lyppes shoulde preserue knowledge) What is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of such and suche places? in steade of resoluing vs, they cast them off, as superfluous, &amp; not tending to our saluation. Therefore why do you say, that all the Scripture testifieth of Christ, and is profitable for our saluation, and must of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of vs be read, and learned? I wyll tel you why: no not I,<note place="margin">Psalm. 12. 6. Pro. 30. 5.</note> but the holy Ghost wyll tell you, how that all the Wordes of the Lorde, are most pure wordes, yea more pure then golde which in the fire seauen times is tryed. And moreouer, the same Apostle, that you say speaketh agaynst them, wyll tell<note place="margin">Roman. 15. 4.</note> you the contrarie: for sayth he, What so euer thinges are written aforetyme (meaning in the Scriptures) are written for our learnyng. Therefore, woo be vnto those blinde Guydes, that woulde so leade you into the dytch, as to make you beleeue, that y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Apostle meaneth the Genealogies contey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the holy Scriptures. In deede, he meaneth that endles Genealogies are vnprofitable: but you must well know, that there is none such in the Scripture, neyther any thyng su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous, or vnprofitable for our saluation. Therefore who woulde thinke that men, who pretende to haue great zeale and knowledge, shoulde be so beastly and foolyshe, as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounde the Apostle in that meaning: as though the Apostle, who spake by the spirite of God, woulde speake agaynst the spirite of God. For I pray you, did not the same spirite set
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:16926:12"/>
downe them, that set downe all the rest: and dare men be so bolde then, as to speake against the wysedome of the holy Ghost: And I pray you, what part of the Bible is there, that doth not thereof consist? be not men the grounde and cause of all the matter there? And how can we knowe the matter as we ought, vnlesse we know the men of whom the matter speaketh? As for example, yf the holy Ghost say, <hi>Sheba</hi> and<note place="margin">Psalm. 72. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Seba</hi> shall bring gyftes, or <hi>Nebaioh</hi> and <hi>Kedar</hi> shall come<note place="margin">Esai. 60. 7.</note> and serue: how can we know rightly what is meant hereby, vnlesse we know the people of whom the holy Ghost doth speake, and also the cause why they were estranged from the Lord, and now shoulde come agayne? Or yf the Lorde do tell you, how that he will subdue the <hi>Canaanites, Heuites, Iebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deutro. 7. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Gergesites,</hi> and the rest of those nations, to geue vnto <hi>Israel</hi> their possessions: must you not of necessitie (yf you wyl know the cause cleerely) vnderstande what these people are, and of whom they come, and also vpon what former prophesie and promises these matters do depende? Yes you are bounde to know them: for the holy Ghost commaundeth you, and all the world to consider of it: euen of this, how that when y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> most High God deuided to the Nations their inheritaunce, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted<note place="margin">Deutro. 32. 8.</note> the borders of A people (meanyng <hi>Canaan</hi> and his sonnes, according to the number of the sonnes of <hi>Israel</hi>) that in tyme they might haue it: So that yf you wyll know any thing in the Booke of God cleerely (as all thinges therein you are bounde to knowe) you must of necessitie knowe the persons that the holy Ghost doth intreate of. For when as the holy Ghost doth tell you of blessednesse to befall <hi>Sem,</hi> and<note place="margin">Gene. 9. 26. 27.</note> his posteritie: and lykewyse the contrarie vnto <hi>Canaan</hi> and his posteritie: and also of a reuersion of <hi>Sems</hi> blessednes to befall <hi>Iapheth</hi> in the ende, and his posteritie, and also how <hi>Canaan</hi> &amp; his posteritie shall be seruantes vnto both them and theirs: how is it possible, I say, for you to vnderstande any thing with iudgement, vnlesse you be able in some good sort to distinguysh of these Families? For all the whole Bible from the ninth of <hi>Genesis</hi> to the ende of the <hi>Reuelation,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth vpon this one Prophesie: euen on this, which by

the spirite of God was vttered in the Chapter before cyted. Or agayne, yf the holy Ghost do tell you of <hi>Moab, Ammon,</hi>

Therefore in the name of God take heede, that you be not so perswaded by them, to beleeue that the Genealogies in the holy Scriptures be endles, or vnprofitable, or super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous: for yf you so thinke, then do you nothing els, but take<note place="margin">Reuel. 22. 19.</note> away from the Scripture, and so the cursse of God wyll come vpon you, euen to your vtter damnation.

For yf you haue learned Christ, sayth the<note place="margin">Ephe. 4. 20. 21. to. 25.</note> Apostle, and haue heard him, and haue been taught by hym, as the trueth is in him, then you must of necessitie cast off the conuersation in tymes past: for otherwyse your knowledge is in vayne, and you remayne as yet the seruantes vnto sinne,<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 16. to the ende.</note> whereunto you were bounde, euen as slaues, geuing your members as seruantes to fulfill the wyll thereof.

Now yf one should aske you what this olde <hi>Adam</hi> is, the which we are so often commanded to cast off: how can it be answered, I pray you, but by the booke of God? For by no write els in all the worlde, can you describe him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right: vnles it be so, as that they haue learned thence: but there you may beholde him as in a glasse most cleere, euen to his very thoughtes, and intentes of the hart, for the worde of God<note place="margin">Hebr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

If then you can not discerne throughly what this olde man is which you are to cast off, but by the worde of God: How much les then are you able to discerne what this new man is, which you are to put on, which after God is created in righteousnes and true holynes, but by the same? For if we be not able in this our corruption, to iudge and discerne throughly of our corruption: but that the Law came &amp; shewed it, that so it myght appeare playnely<note place="margin">Rom 5. 20. and.. 3. 20. and. 7. 13.</note> to abounde: How is it possible then (being altogether blinde in iudgement) that we shoulde discerne that exceeding righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes

of Christe, which we are to put on, but that the same hath also shewed it? And therefore the Apostle telleth you,<note place="margin">Ephe. 4. 23. 24</note> that you must be renewed in the spirit of your minde before he bidde you put on the newe man. For howe can you put on Christe, vnles you knowe him? and how can you knowe him, but by the booke of God where he only is described? So that the first steppe you are to make to true mortification, is to mortifie your follie: and that can not be done, but by the quickening of your wysedome: neyther can that be done, but by the worde of God. For by thy Statutes haue I been<note place="margin">Psalme. 19. 93.</note> quickened, sayth the Prophet: therefore as the Apostle sayth,<note place="margin">Colo. 3. 16.</note> Let the worde of Christe dwell in you most plenteously, euen in al wisedome, wherby you may be so changed by the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 2.</note> of your mindes, as that you may be able to proue, what is the goodwyll of God, and acceptable and perfect: and<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 1.</note> when you haue so done, then in any wyse geue vp your bodies as liuing sacrifices, holy, and acceptable vnto God, by your obedience in seeking to fulfill the same: alwayes prouided, that the knowledge thereof must first goe before: for so much may you also wel perceiue by the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> his speeches, which are these: I wyll not be negligent, sayth he, to put you<note place="margin">2. Pet. 1. 12.</note> alwayes in remembrance of these thinges, though that you haue knowledge. Wherby you may learne that the Apostles did euer plant the knowledge of Christe in mens brestes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they woulde commaunde them to walke: because that otherwyse their mortification, or walking had been in vaine. For yf an vnbeleeuing <hi>Iew,</hi> or a <hi>Turke,</hi> or a <hi>Papist,</hi> or any other what so euer, that knoweth not Christ aright, should do all the good workes in the worlde, or mortifie the fleshe neuer so much, yet shoulde none of all these thinges profite him any thing at all, vnles he knew the vertue of Christ his resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and also the righteousnes which he shoulde haue by him: because it is not the workes that maketh the man good, but the man that maketh the workes good.

to be increasing in the knowledge of the Sonne of God, then may you safely say, that you are one of those that do beleeue in him: and then agayne, yf you be one of those that do sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastly beleeue in him, you haue then perfourmed the chiefest<note place="margin">Iohn. 6. 29.</note> worke that God requireth at your handes: yea then haue you also learned true mortification in deede, otherwyse you haue it not. For true mortification consisteth not only in humilitie, or in not sparing of the body, or in not satisfiyng of the fleshe, to fulfill the lustes thereof. Neyther do good workes, as you<note place="margin">Colo. 2. 18, to the ende.</note> see, onely consist in the doing of that which is required vnto men, for so the <hi>Papistes,</hi> and many others, as the forenamed, woulde goe before you in that kinde: but they both consist chiefly in the soundnes of your knowledge, which you ought to haue of the Sonne of God. Therefore whereas the most part of people are brought to this passe, that is, euen to thinke that yf they can say they do beleeue in Christ, and learne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to bring foorth the fruites of a christian lyfe, which is to feede the hungrie, to cloath the naked, to visit the sicke, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue the prisoners, to do vnto all men, as they woulde be done vnto, and to mortifie the lustes of the flesh: all which in deede are their dueties concerning the seconde Table, and therefore worthy of commendation for so much. But whereas they are brought to this passe I say, which is to thinke, that yf they can performe these thinges, that they haue then performed the only thing the Lord requireth, they are greatly deceyued: for the Lorde requireth a great deale further matter at their handes then so. For knowe you not the answere of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour vnto the Ruler, who had asked what he might do to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herite eternall lyfe? yf you do not, this is it: Yet lackest thou one thing, sayth our Sauiour. Now what this one thing was that he then lacked, I wyll shew you. First then the Ruler<note place="margin">Math. 19. 16. to 26. &amp; Mark. 10 17. to. 25. and Luke. 18. 18. to. 26.</note> demaunding of our Sauiour what he myght do to inherite eternall lyfe, and our Sauiour reciting the dueties of the seconde Table: and he replying, that he had kept them all, euen from his very youth. Our Sauiour trieth him then with a further and more chiefer poynt, that is, with his duetie concerning the fyrst Table, and telleth him playnely, that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:16926:19"/>
he lacked one thing yet, and that in deede the most chiefest thing of all, which was his loue towardes our Sauiour Christ: and therefore sayth our Sauiour vnto him: Sell all that thou hast, and come and folowe me, thinking thereby to try his obedience towardes the first Table, that is, to see whether he did so loue the Lorde in hart, mynde, and soule, as that he coulde be contented to leaue all that he had, and folow him, as <hi>Abraham, Moses, Dauid, Daniel,</hi> and diuers others<note place="margin">Matth. 4. 18. to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Therefore this is the marke the which most earnestly I do shoote at, euen this, to haue you and all men well to know, that the Lorde requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth most chiefly your whole duetie, as touching the fyrst Table, which is not fulfilled onely in saying there is but one God, Father, Sonne, and holy Ghost, nor in saying you beleeue to be saued by the seconde person in the trinitie: but you must well knowe that the Lorde doth also require a most intire loue to be shewed towarde him, that is, he wyll haue<note place="margin">Deutro. 6. 5. 6. to the ende.</note> you to loue him euen with all your hart, with all your minde, with all your soule, with all your strength, the which loue can in no wyse be so greatly expressed, as when you haue a most earnest desire to heare his voyce, and when as rather<note place="margin">My sheepe heare my voyce, and I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But since that he hath appoynted an ordinarie meanes for such to come by the knowledge of his Sonne, we must looke to that, and desire of the Lord, that it woulde please him to inlighten our mindes thereby. And whereas you say, that all men haue not tyme and leysure to attayne vnto skill and knowledge in the booke of God. That is not so: for yf they woulde bestowe but that one day of seauen, which the Lord hath commaunded them, eyther in hearing the worde or reading therein them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, they myght attaine vnto very great knowledge: yea so great, as that they might be able at the least to geue a sound reason of their fayth: yea and to auoyde the deadly blowes of Satan, although not able to cast off al: especially if that one day were bestowed with like delyght and desire of the attey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thereunto, as they woulde do yf it were a worldly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie, or vayne desire they shoulde seeke after.

Againe, seeing there came no suche perfection by the giftes and sacrifices, which their high priest once a yeere offered, as to take away either his owne sinnes, or the sinnes of the people: but that euery yeere there must be a remembrance againe: because of this imperfection, I say, they were driuen to looke for one to come, who should be able perfectly to saue those that would come vnto God by him, and who would in the end appeare to take away their sinnes by the sacrifice of his owne bodie once made: and so enter not into the holy places made with handes, but euen into y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> very heauen it selfe, to appeare in the sight of God, and there to sit for euer to make intereession for them: and by whose bloud they might be bold to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that holy place themselues, euen by that newe and liuing way which he would prepare for them, not through the vaile of silke, but euen through the very vaile of his owne flesh.

conclude this speeche, Christ was preached vnto them in most comfortable, and also most terrible sort, as by the effect they found it. Behold, saith the Lord, I send an angel before thee,<note place="margin">Exod. 23. 20. to the ende.</note> to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I haue prepared. Beware of him (saith the Lord) and heare his voyce, for I tel thee, he will not spare your misdeedes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause my name is in him. But if thou hearken vnto his voyce, and doe all that I speake, then I will be an enimie vnto thine enimies, and will afflict them that afflict thee: for mine angell shall go before thee, and bring thee into the land of the <hi>Ammorites,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>

Now here you see againe in what plaine words Christ was preached vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for they might well know that this Angel must needes be Christ the sonne of God: and so the<note place="margin">1. Corin. 10. 9.</note> Apostle expoundeth it, euen of this Angel of the couenant which <hi>Malachie</hi> also speaketh of. For who is the brightnesse<note place="margin">Mala. 3. 1.</note> of the glorie, or the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ingrauen forme, or the verie character of<note place="margin">Hebr. 1. 3.</note> the person of the father, but onely Christ? In whome, as the<note place="margin">Colo. 2. 9.</note> Apostle saith, dwelleth all the fulnesse of the Godhead euen corporally. Who although he had not as yet taken the nature of man, yet he appeareth to <hi>Ioshua</hi> in the forme of a man, to<note place="margin">Ioshua. 5. 13. to the end.</note> shew that in time he so would be: and therefore doth <hi>Ioshua</hi> doe worshippe vnto him, as acknowledging him to be his only God &amp; sauiour Christ. So that by this they might well knowe, it was not Iesus the captaine sonne of <hi>Nun,</hi> that conquered the lande for them: but Iesus the sonne of God, euen that noble captaine of the Lords host, who not onely set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them in the rest of that earthly <hi>Canaan,</hi> but also in the heauenly.

notwithstanding all the great thyngs the Lorde had done for them, as styll to rayse vp deliuerers to deliuer them from the crueltie of their oppressours, which through their owne ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie befell them: Notwithstanding all this I say, and many other his great benefites bestowed vpon them, they continued still in that great sinne of infidelitie and mistrust of the Lorde his goodnes.

that by them the brightnesse thereof shoulde be continually darkened, euen darkened by the smoke that should arise from that bottomlesse <note n="*" place="margin">It is sayde in <hi>Apoc.</hi> the 8. that out of the pitte came a smoke that darkened the sunne &amp; the ayre: wherby is meant that all brighnes of Scripture should be darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aed by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptes and doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of men, whiche y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> rabbie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Popes woulde vrge vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Church.

For these and such like causes, I say, hath the Lord set that cage of <hi>Romaine</hi> infidels, as a marke for his wrath to ayme at while the world shall stand, and hath also described them and their villanies, by the moste horrible villanies of all ages throughout the old testament, and onely to the intent to giue vs warning to auoyd them, as also theyr maners and theyr condemnation.</p>

So that as our sauiour y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> head of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Church, was himself most cruelly afflicted by the Dragon, and also by his ministers, for these three yeeres and a halfe, the which began at his bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, and ended at his death: euen so shoulde his members be after the same maner while the world should stand. For wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as this sixt gouernement these prophane. Emperours were rooted out, as if the beast had had the wound of a sword, &amp; one head cut off, or as if he had been dead for a long time by means first of <hi>Constantinus</hi> that good christian Emperour, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes of other nations who greatly spoyled Rome: yet now by these popes is hee reuiued agayne. For they setting themselues in the temple of God, as if they were God, and causing all nations to worship them in the same maner that they had done the former beast, and ruling themselues ouer the Empire, are sayde heere to make the seuenth policie in Rome, and likewise after a sorte to be an eight: the whiche policie is sayd to haue the whole power of Sathan, as the former had, euen to haue the strength as it were of warlike horses, to make battle against y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> citie of Saints. Now if you thinke that the former exposition by the angel concerning the seuen heades of the beast be not plaine inought, he will let you haue it yet more plaine: for he telleth you further, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> seuen heades are also seuen hilles, whereon the woman sitteth: and<note place="margin">Apoc. 17. 9. 18</note> he also telleth you, that the woman is the great citie that raigneth ouer the kinges of the earth. If this be true as most true it is, then can you not doubt of the plainnesse heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: for you are to vnderstand that <hi>Rome</hi> standeth vpon seuen hils: and you are to vnderstand also, that when saint <hi>Iohn</hi> had this reuelation shewed hym, that Rome was then the great citie that raygned ouer the kinges of the earth: and likewise that now it is: and therefore moste fitly was it sayd, that the latter beast had ten hornes, as well as the former: forasmuch as the popes had ten nations or kingdomes to yeeld obedience

vnto theyr power as the former had to theyrs. And to make the matter more playne, that Idolatrous <hi>Rome</hi> was reuiued agayne by these popes: saint <hi>Iohn</hi> hath another vision shewed hym, which is this: Hee seeth a beast aryse out of the earth, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing<note place="margin">Apoc. 13. 11.</note> two hornes like vnto the lambe. Meaning thereby, that these popes would come as pretending great shew of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and as if they were the vycars of Christ that lambe of God, but hee telleth you that he spake like the Dragon, and that hee did all that the first beast could doe that was before hym: yea and that hee caused the image of the former beast to be made, and gaue hym spirite and life, and made all the earth to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship hym, whose deadly wound by them was healed. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore<note place="margin">Apoc. 13. 13. 14.</note> for their helpe therein, saint <hi>Iohn</hi> sheweth you that this lambe should worke great signes and wonders, euen so great as if it were to bring fire from heauen, as <hi>Elyas</hi> did:<note place="margin">1. Kinges 18. 21. to 41.</note> to the end that as hee thereby caused all <hi>Israel</hi> to turne from the worship of <hi>Ieroboams</hi> calues vnto the Lord to worship him, euen so in a contrary sort woulde this lambe seeke with the signes which were permitted hym to doe, to turne all men both small and great, rich and poore, free and bond, from the worship of the Lord, to the worship of the beast, and to force them thereby to receiue his marke, eyther in their right hands or in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> forheads, or at leastwise to beare his name, or the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of hys name: for vnlesse they would so doe, they shoulde<note place="margin">Apoc. 13. 15. 16. 17.</note> neyther buy nor sell, but be killed. So that heere you see, how fitly this agreeth with the other vision for the popes to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiuors of the former beast, and also howe fitly it falleth out ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that whiche our sauiour and saint <hi>Paul</hi> before had told you, that is: that there should come false prophets which<note place="margin">Math. 7. 15. &amp; 1.

And moreouer therefore is it, that it pleaseth hym to paynt them out so playne vnto vs: for although they woulde seeme neuer so muche to beare the hornes of a lambe, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so much to pretend religion, or shew of holynesse, yet the
