            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas it appertaineth to Us to have special Care, that the common High-ways, and
Bridges, leading from place to place within this Realm, might be kept in due repair for
the ease and good of Our Loving Subjects; And observing notwithstanding the good
provision of Our Laws in that behalf made, and the conformity and forwardness of
Our Subjects in so Publique and Necessary a Work, That Our High-ways and Brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
are at this present grown into great decay, and very dangerous for Passage, We have
upon due examination found, that the said Decays are occasioned by the common Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers
of this Realm, who for their singular and private profit, do now usually Travail
with Carts and Wagons with four Wh√©els, drawn with eight, nine, or ten Horses or
more, and do commonly therein carry sixty and seventy hundred weight at one burthen
at one time, which burden and weight is so great and excessive, as that the very Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of Bridges are in many places thereby shaken, and the High-ways and Cawseys Furrowed and Ploughed
up by the Wh√©els of the said Carts and Wagons so overladen, and made so d√©ep, and full of dangerous Slows
and Holes, as neither can Passengers Travail thereby in Safety, nor the Inhabitants or Persons by Law bound
to repair them, be able to undergo so great a charge: Where heretofore all common Carriers usually went with
Carts of two Wh√©els onely, wherewith they could not well carry above twenty hundred weight at once, or there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts,
which the Bridges, Cawseys, and ordinary High-ways, did and might well bear without any great
damage to the same: We therefore intending the Reformation of the Premisses, and it having b√©en resolved by the
Advice of the Iudges formerly taken herein, That by the Law of this Our Realm, the said excessive and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb facs="tcp:54008:2"/>
kind of Carriages, whereby Our High-ways are thus destroyed, are common Nusances and Annoyances
against the Weal-publique, and an offence against Our Crown; Do hereby streightly charge, require and command,
that no common Carrier, or other person or persons whatsoever, shall hereafter use, go, or travail with any Cart
or Wagon made with four Wheels, to be drawn with above five Horses at once along their Iourney, unless they go
all two abrest, in which case they are limited to no number, that the High-ways and Bridges may hereafter receive
the less damage thereby, upon pain of incurring Our high Displeasure, and to receive condign punishment, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temners
of Our Royal Will and Commandment, and to be further prosecuted and punished for the said Nusances
and Annoyances, by Fine and such other ways, as the Laws of this Our Realm have provided against Offenders in
that kind: To which end, We do hereby expresly charge, as well Our Iudges, as Our Atturney-General, to exact
and require the extremity of Our Laws in that behalf; And that every Offender contrary to this Our Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
shall for his contempt be prosecuted in Our Court of Kings Bench, and other Courts whereunto the Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance
thereof shall belong, by Information or Indictment, and thereupon be Fined and proc√©eded against according
to their demerit; Nevertheless, Our Intent, Will, and Commandment is, And we do hereby streightly charge,
command, and prohibite, that no common Carrier whatsoever shall by colour hereof take occasion to Inhance or
raise the prices of Carriage from any part or place within Our said Realm, under pain of Our Displeasure, and
upon complaint thereof to Us, or Our Privy Councel made, to be further punished; as shall be thought fit and just
according to Law. And lastly, We do hereby Will and Require all Majors, Sheriffs, Iustices of Peace, and other
Our Officers and Ministers in all Counties and Priviledged Places whatsoever within this Our Realm, that they,
and every of them in their several Offices and Places, do from time to time provide and see to the due execution of
this Our Pleasure and Royal Commandment; and that they discover and make known all offenders herein, that
they may be severely punished for their contempts, as also that they neglect not, but continue the repaire and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of High-ways, Bridges and Cawseys within this Our Realm, according to the Laws, Statutes and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
now in force, as they tender Our Pleasure, and will answer the contrary at their utmost perils.</p>
