            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>It has been my Fortune, through the short Course of my <hi>Poetry,</hi> to run o'er the Rugged Ways of Publick Censure, with as much In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference as any one; and as I have alwayes Studied Variety to procure Diversion, so have I met with as Various Success— yet have been easy by Teaching my Self the <hi>Philosophy</hi> of <hi>Patience,</hi> and the Use of that Common Saying, <hi>Many Men have many Minds, and those Many Minds possess'd with more Difficult Expectations then gen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <l>Fearing to tire ye with more <hi>English Tales,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Has laid his <hi>Scene</hi> in the <hi>French Court, Versailles.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Thus Chang'd your Diet for Variety,</l>
            <l>From our Course <hi>Cheese</hi> of homely huswifry,</l>

            <l>He doubts not, many that sit here to day,</l>
            <l>That have observ'd the Title to his Play,</l>
            <l>Believe 'tis for some Pollitique Essay;</l>
            <l>'Gainst this he says, a Proverb gives him Rules,</l>
            <l>'Tis never safe to meddle with Edg'd Tooles.</l>
            <l>To cause diversion Comick Mirth is best,</l>
            <l>Warr's but a dull Occasion for a Iest;</l>
            <l>And as in Cudgel Play, we find—no Ioke,</l>
            <l>From either party, when both heads are broke.</l>
            <l>But then perhaps it may expected be,</l>
            <l>That he should fall upon <hi>French Fopery,</hi>

            <l>And now our Coat Flaps broad as Shoulder Mutton,</l>
            <l>With various colours fac'd, Red, Green and Sky;</l>
            <l>Next year I hope they'll give us Wings to fly,</l>
            <l>With Sleeves so large, to cover Nails and all,</l>
            <l>And every Button like a Tennis Ball.</l>
            <l>No folly's theirs, but we have here as bad,</l>
            <l>Their Brains have too much Air and ours have too much Led;</l>
            <l>They swear and Rant in spritely <hi>Ela</hi>—Sounds,</l>
