            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Gentlemen, and Fellow-Souldiers,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HAving for theſe twenty years,
been Imploy'd in Marſhall Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
and carefully obſerved the
Practices of ſome Officers Late
of the Army, with grief I expreſſe the many
Injuries and unparrallel'd Cruelties exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
on perſons deſerving ſo much honour
and affection from them as you have done;
is the onely Cauſe that drew me to this!
And no ſiniſter or byaſt-Intereſt whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
having always valued the Peace and
Welfare of the Nation, far above my own
Concernments. And now perceiving that
there are ſtrong endeavours once more to
make theſe Nations and yourſelves miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
by continuation of a War; and that
there are not wanting thoſe who labour to
perſwade you that your Intereſt lies in Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40304:3"/>
to ſome Officers late of the Army;
who have made ſhipwrack of all Oaths and
Engagments, through whoſe breach of faith
you are become contemptible to all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
who are ſo far from making a Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
towards God or Man by an unfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Repentance, and turning from the evil
of their practices, that they with their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments,
palliate their fowl Enormities,
endeavouring by all means poſſible to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
the honour of all your Actions, by
Adhering to them whoſe Power is Will,
whoſe Juſtice is Cruelty, whoſe Laws are
Confuſion, whoſe Religion is the Seat of
Rebellion, whoſe Deſigne can have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
End then Tyranny, and to involve
you and yours in perpetual Slavery. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Fellow Souldiers,</hi> Let us look back and
ſurvey their by paſt practices, and we ſhall
find there was never Oath or Promiſe kept
farther then ſerved their own Intereſt. Did
not moſt of thoſe Officers (by Gods mercy)
now caſhier'd the Army, purchaſe your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benters
(the price of blood) from two ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
to a noble in the pound, to enrich
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40304:3"/>
themſelves, and perpetuate your Slavery.
And through their Cruelty many of our
<hi>Fellow Souldiers,</hi> which were wounded in
Battle and made unſervicable, with wives
and children ſtarved in the ſtreets for want
of bread, while they Lorded it over you,
Tyrant-like.</p>
            <p>Now Examine your ſelves whether when
you have demanded your pay, you were
not had before Court Martialls, and hang'd
to all your ſhames, while they rob'd you
and the Commonwealth of your Dues. And
let me further deſire you to conſider what
you can expect; who have alwayes been
made the ſcorne and contempt of thoſe
whom you have advanc't by your valour.
The premiſes being duly and Chriſtianly
conſidered, I as a Friend and Fellow Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,
have made bold to write to you theſe
lines, that you might the better ſee your
Condition, if you ſhould ſuffer your ſelves
again to be captivated by the ſpecious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
of an Intereſted ſort of People, who
rage and rore (like their Father the Divel)
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40304:4"/>
wanting your aſſiſtance to help them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
            <p>Therefore my earneſt Requeſt to you is,
that you would as you are Chriſtians and
Engliſhmen, bewail the bloud you have
already ſpilt in your own Countrey, and
with ſouls fitted for the Receit of Mercy,
humbly proſtrate your ſelves before the
God of Mercy, beſeeching him to diſtill
into your ſouls by the Influence of his holy
Spirit, Grace: whereby you may be fitted
to be made partakers of ſo great a Mercy
and Deliverance, as the Lord himſelf is
now a working in the three, wounded,
bleeding, and miſerable Nations, which is
his own bleſſing, Peace, the fruits whereof
though but in the bud, ſhould raiſe your
ſouls to that pitch, that you ſhould with all
cheerfulneſs humbly ſubmit to his gratious
hand of providence, who ſeems mercifully
once more to ſhine upon theſe Nations, by
reſtoring unto us our native Rights as men,
and my dear fellow-ſouldiers, let not rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<hi>Rabſhekeys</hi> prevaile over you, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40304:4"/>
you that you ſhall loſe your rights
as Chriſtians, for the Lord himſelfe will
plead the cauſe of the humble and meek,
but the ſtiffnecked and rebellious he will
deſtroy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I ſhall conclude with this exhortation,</hi>
That you would ſeriouſly conſider, and ponder
in your hearts this truth, That if you comply
not, and ſubmit not with the Nations publique
Intereſt, and juſt Power now made choice of
by common conſent of the people, but follow a
few private Ambitious Reſtleſs perſons, whoſe
gain is their godlineſs, whoſe glory is their
ſhame, you will run your ſelves on the rock
of Ruine, and make your names infamous to
all poſterity: And which is moſt deplorable,
run headlong to your own eternall ruine.</p>
            <p>The which that you may prevent, with
one heart yeeld conſent and obedience to
the peoples free Choice in Parliament; And
let all that love <hi>Englands</hi> peace ſay <hi>Amen.</hi>
