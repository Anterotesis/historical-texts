         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>It is ſaid, that his Majeſty writ this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

            <p>HIs Majeſty is very pleaſant, and merry,
and (as it is ſaid) very well pleaſed
and ſatisfied with the preſent affaires of the
army, ſaying, that it is a farre more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
action, to rely on his Excellency Sir
<hi>Thomas Fairfax,</hi> and the army under his
immediate command, touching his coming
to <hi>London,</hi> then to have harboured the leaſt
thought of being conveyed to <hi>London</hi> by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the contrary party, who were active
in the late deſigne againſt the army. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
divers times his Majeſty hath beene

have repaired to the Court, oftentimes mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
his Majeſty therein.</p>
            <p>But He alwayes diſclaimed the ſame, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying
<pb facs="tcp:160424:4"/>
a great diſlike thereof, and (as it is
reported) was the firſt that diſcovered their
private intentions, and wicked deſigne, of
conveying his Majeſty from the army.</p>
            <p>Whereupon, notice being given to divers
of his Excellencies Commanders there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
it was ordered that all ſuch perſons, that
held correſpondency with the adverſe Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
then under command of <hi>Poyntz</hi> and
<hi>Maſſie,</hi> ſhould immediatly depart the Court,
which was accordingly performed; for one
Mr. <hi>Wood,</hi> a Reformado under the command
of our renowned Lieutenant General <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi>
were very active in the executing of
this order, and would not ſuffer a man to
