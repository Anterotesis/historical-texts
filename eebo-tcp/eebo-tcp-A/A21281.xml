            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>EVery man dooth won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der (gentle reader) at an Eclipse of the Sunne or of the Moone, and gazeth at a Blazing Starre, and beholdeth with admiration, an exquisit picture, drawne with the pensill of a skilfull hand, yea all nouelties doe please, be they neuer so small. But if they be once com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, bee they neuer so great wonders, no man vouchsafeth to giue them the looking on. But then as <hi>Seneca</hi> doth say: <hi>Non est AEthiopia inter suos <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> color.</hi> The selfe same doth happen in man, and in the wonderfull workmanship of his bodie, and vnspeakeable excellencie of his soule: for if we regarde his excellencie, he doth surpasse all creatures vnder Heauen; and therefore the Aegyptians being rauished with the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of mans dignitie and perfection, doubted not to call him a terrestriall god, a
<pb facs="tcp:8773:3"/>
celestiall creature, a messenger of the god Lord and Master of things belowe, and a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar friend vnto those who liue aboue, miracle of nature, and as <hi>Seneca</hi> doth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> him, Natures darling.</p>
            <p>It is said, that after that <hi>Phidias</hi> a most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous caruer had made <hi>Mineruas</hi> shielde, he engraued his own portraiture so liuely, &amp; deepely in the same, that it could neuer be taken out againe, without the defacing of the whole worke. So God himselse a farre more excellent workeman then <hi>Phidias,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had made the vniuersall world, and all creatures therein, for a token of his skill, drew it a new in a small compas, as an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgement of all his workes, to wit, when he made man, who is a Microcosme or little worlde, and in him printed his owne image and similitude, so liuely, that no power what soeuer is able to blot it out. This image and similitude is the soule and vnderstanding, which he would neuer haue printed in man, vnlesse he had first made him a bodie of a substance fit and apt to receiue that impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and vnlesse also he had so skilfully fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it, that it should be worthie to receiue so great an ornament, as the vnderstanding
<pb facs="tcp:8773:3"/>
is. And therefore the body of man is made of a complexion most pure and delicate, and in shape comely and beautifull, and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, all these perfections which man hath in himselfe, few or none take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the studie of himselfe, or is carefull to know the substance, state, condition, quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and vse of the parts of his owne bodie, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he be the honor of nature, and more to be adm red then the strangest and rarest wonder that euer happened. The cause of this is no other, but because mans nature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth in noueltie, and neglecteth to search out the causes of those things which are common.</p>
            <p>I haue therefore thought good, to giue thee in a knowne tongue, this little booke, written by the deepest of all Philosophers who teacheth the vse of all the parts of mans body, their nature, quality, property and vse, which may bring thee in reading of it, if reade it thou wilt no lesse delite then profit, nor no lesse profit then delight.</p>

               <p>Question.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>AMongst all liuing creatures, why hath Man onely his face and countenance lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vp towards <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">
                        <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Vnto this question there are diuers answers: first, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> proceedeth from the will of the creator himselfe. And although that answer be true, yet in this out purpose it seemeth not to be of force, because that so all questions might easilie be dissolued.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I answer, that for the most part cuery workeman doth make his first worke worst, and then his second better, and so God creating all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beasts before man, gaue them their face looking downe to the earth, and then secondly hee created man, as it doth appeare in Genesis, vnto whom he gaue an honest shape lifted vp vnto hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. But yet this answer doth not seeme to be to the purpose, because it is drawne from diuinitie, and doth also derogate from the goodnes of God,
<pb facs="tcp:8773:5"/>
who maketh all his workes perfect and good.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is answered, that man onely among all liuing creatures is ordayned vnto the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heauen, and therefore hath his face ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uated and lifted vp vnto Heauen, because that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spising worldly and earthly things, he ought to contemplate on heauenly things.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that the reasonable soule is like vnto Angels, and finally ordayned towards God, as it appeareth by <hi>Auerroes</hi> in the first <hi>de anima,</hi> and therefore he hath a figure looking vpward.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, that a man is a microcosme, that is, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle world, as it pleaseth <hi>Aristotle</hi> to say in the eight of his <hi>Phys.</hi> and therefore he doth command all other liuing creatures, and they obey him.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, it is answered, that naturally, there is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to euery thing, and euery worke, that forme and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure giuen, which is fit and proper for his motion; as vnto the Heauen roundnes, to the fire a pyrami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall forme, that is, broade beneath and sharpe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the top, which forme is most apt to ascende: and so man hath his face vp to Heauen, to behold and wonder at Gods workes.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why is the head of beastes hayrie?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> The answer according vnto the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Constant</hi> is, that the hayres are an ornament of the head, and of the brayne, and the brayne is purged and euacuated of grosle humors, by the growing of the hayre, from the highest vnto the lowest parts, which passe through the pores of the exterior flesh, and doc become drie and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted into hayres. This appeareth to be true, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that in all mans body there is nothing drier
<pb facs="tcp:8773:5"/>
then the hayres, for they are drier then the bones, as <hi>Albertus Magnus</hi> doth affirme, because that some beastes are nourished with bones, as dogges, but no beast can digest feathers or hayre, but doe voyde them vndigested, and are so due that they are vnfit for nutriment.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is answered, that the brayne is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged fowre manner of wayes, first, of superfluous watery humors, by the eyes: from melancholy by the eares: of choler by the nose: of fleume by the hayre, and that is the intent of the Phisitian.</p>
               <p>Question <hi>Why haue men longer hayre on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> head then other liuing creatures?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> 3 degenerat animal.</hi> saith, that man hath the moystest brayne of all liuing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, from the which the sweat proceedeth, which is conuerted into the long hayre of the head.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is answered, that the humors in man are fat, and doe not become due easilie, and therefore the hayre growe long in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> in other beasts the humors are easilie dried, and therefore their hayre grow not so long.</p>
               <p>Question, <hi>Why do the hayre take deeper roote in mans skin then in other liuing creatures?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because they haue greater store of nourishment in man, and therefore growe more into the inward part of man. And this is also the reason, why in other beasts the hayre doth alter and change with the skin, and not in man, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> it be sometime in a searre or wound.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why haue women longer hayre then men?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because women are moyster than
<pb facs="tcp:8773:6"/>
men, and more flegmatick, and therefore there is more matter of hayre in them, and by a conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, the length also of their hayre doth follow. And further more this matter is more increased in women then in men, from the interior parts, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially in the time of their monthlie tearmes and flowres, because the matter doth then ascend, wherby the humor which breedeth the hayre doth encrease. And <hi>Albertus</hi> doth say, that if the hayre of a woman in the time of her flowers be put into doung, a venemous serpent is engendered of it.</p>
               <p>The second answer is, because women want beards, and so the matter of the beard doth goe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the matter of hayre.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why haue some men soft hayre, and some men hard?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Wee answer with <hi>Aristotle,</hi> that the hayre hath proportion with the skinne: of which some is hard some thick, some subtill and soft, some grosse; therefore the hayre which groweth out of a thick and grosse skin, is thick and grosse; and that which groweth of a subtill and fine, is fine and soft. Also when the pores are open, then there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth forth much humor, and therefore hard haire is ingendered: and when the pores are straite, then there doe growe soft and fine hayre. And this doth <hi>Aristotle</hi> shew in men, in whom we haue an euident token, because women haue softer hayre then they, because that in women, the pores are shut and are straite by reason of their coldnes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, because that for the most part, chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick men haue harder and thicker hayre then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, by reason of their heate, and because the
<pb facs="tcp:8773:6"/>
pores are euer open in them, and therefore also they haue beards sooner then others And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Philosopher saith, that those beasts which haue hard hayre are bouldest, because that such hayre proceedeth of heate and choler, the which choler maketh men to fight. <hi>Aristotle</hi> also giueth example in the Beare and the Boare: and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwise those beasts which haue soft hayre, are feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, because they be colde, as the Hare and Hart. <hi>Aristotle</hi> doth also giue another reason of the soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and hardnes of the hayre, drawne from the cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat where a man is borne: because that in a hot region hard and gresse hayre is ingendered, as it appeareth in the Aethiopians, and the contrarie is true in a colde counney, as towards the North.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why haue some men curled hayre and some smoothe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> The answer is, that the cause of the curling of the hayre is great abundance of heate, so that if there be much heate in a man then his hayre doth curle, and grow vpward. And a signe of this is proued true, because that sometimes a man doth enter into a bath smoothe hayred, and afterward by the bath becommeth curled. And therefore the keepers of bathes haue often curled hayre, and also the Aethiopians and cholericke men. But the cause of the smoothnes, is the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of moyst humors, which tend downeward, and a proofe of this is, because that women for the most part haue smoothe hayre, because they haue much humiditie in them and small heate.</p>

                  <hi>Answer.</hi> We answer Phisitian like, because that in man and woman there is abundance of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie in that place, but more in women, because men haue the mouth of the bladder in that place, wherein the vrine is contained, of the which the hayre in the breast is ingendered, and about the nauell.

               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> The answer is according vnto <hi>Arist 1. de generat, animal</hi> because that in women all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miditie and superfluitie, which are the matter and cause of the bayre of the bodie is expelled with their monthly tearmes, the which superfluitie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in men, and through vapors doth passe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hayre.

               <p>
                  <hi>Answer</hi> The answer according vnto the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers is, because that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath the hottest harr. of all huing creatures: and therefore nature being most wise, least man should be suffecated through the heate of his hart, hath placed the hart which is most hot, vnder the braine which is most colde, to the end that the heate of the hart may be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered with the coldnes of the braine, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riewise, that the coldnes of the braine may be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the heate of the hart, that thereby there might be a temperature in both.

Whereby it doth appeare that hoarenes is nothing else, but a whitenes of the hayre, caused by the putrifaction of humors about the rootes of the hayre, through the want of naturall heate in olde age. Sometimes also graynes is caused by the naughtines of the complexion, which may well happen in youth, and sometimes by reason of the moystnes vndigested, and sometimes through ouer great feare or care, as it appeareth in Marchants, Saylers, theeues, from thence commeth those ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. <hi>Cura &amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>Answer.</hi> The better to vnderstand this questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, note the difference betwixt graynes and grisly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, because that graynes is caused through the defect of a naturall heate, but grislienes through deuouring and eating, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> witnesseth, 7. <hi>de animal.</hi> The Wolfe being a very deuouring beast, and a great eater, he letteth it downe gluttonoasly without chewing, and that at once enough for three dayes: of which meate grosse vapours are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendered in the Wolfes body, &amp; by a consequence grislienes Secondly, graynes and grislines do dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, because graynes is onely in the head, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>Answer</hi> According vnto <hi>Aristotle,</hi> because they are for the most part in the sunne, and in his openi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on also, heate dooth accidently cause putrification, and therefore of that kinde of heate, the matter of the hayre doth putrifie, and by a consequence, they are very quicklie pild.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer. Aristotle</hi> doth giue the same reason for both, because that the want of moysture in hoth, is the cause of the want <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> hayre &amp; of the leaues. And this is proued because that a man becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth balde through Venerie, because that leache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie is a letting forth of naturall humiditie &amp; heate. And so by that excesse in carnal pleasure, moysture is consumed, which is the nutriment of the hayre, and therefore baldnes doth insue. And this is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently proued in Eunuches, and women which doe not growe balde, because that they doe not
<pb facs="tcp:8773:9"/>
depart from that moystnes. And these upon Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuches are of the complexion of women.</p>
               <p>But if you aske why Eunuches be not bald, nor haue not the gowte, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> saith? The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer is according vnto <hi>Galen,</hi> because the cause of baldnes is drines, the which is not in Eunuches, because they want their stones, the which doe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister heate vnto al the parts of the bodie, and the heate doth open the pores, the which being open, the haire doth fall.</p>

               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because baldnes doth witnesse a cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerike complexion, which is hot and drie, and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerike men are naturally deceitfull, according vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that verse:</p>
               <p>Hirsutus, fallax irascens, prodigus, audax.</p>
               <p>And therefore it followeth, <hi>a primo ad vltimum,</hi> that bald men are deceitfull and craftie.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because the sight is more necessarie for vs then the smelling: and therefore it doth proceede of the goodnes of nature, that if wee receiue any hurt or losse of one eye, that yet the other should remaine, and so wee see that the spirit, with which wee see, called <hi>spiritus visiuus,</hi> is directed vnto one eye, as it is plaine in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon perspectiue.</p>

                  <hi>Answer.</hi> According vnto the opinion of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle,</hi> it proceedeth from the want of fire, and for the assembling and meeting together of light and humour in the eyes, which are lightened by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

                  <hi>Answer</hi> Because (saith <hi>Aristotle</hi>) grainesse is light and shining of it selfe, and the spirits with which wee see are weakened in the day time, and strengthened in the night.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why be mens eyes of diuers sorts?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> This proceedeth; saith <hi>Aristotle,</hi> by reason of the diuersitie of humors. The eye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath foure couerings, and three humors. The first is called Consolidatiue, which is the outer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most, which is strong and fat. The second is called a hornie skinne or couering, to the likenes of a horne, and that is a cleere couering. The third is called Vuea, of the likenes of a grape. The fourth is called a Cobweb: but according vnto the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of some, the eye doth consist of seuen coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings or skinnes, and three humours. The first is called Albugitieus, for the likenes vnto the white of an egge. The second Clacial, that is like vnto yee. The third Vitreus, that is cleere like a glasse. And that diuersitie of humours, causeth the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie of eyes.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why are men which haue but one eye good Archers, and why doe good Archers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly shut one eye, and why doe such as behold the starres looke thorow a trunke with one eye?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> This matter is handled in the perspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue art, and the reason is, as it dooth appeare in the booke of Causes, because that euery vertue
<pb facs="tcp:8773:12"/>
and strength vnited and knit together, is stronger then it selfe dispersed and scattered. Therefore all the force of seeing dispersed into two eyes, the one being shut, is gathered vnto the other, and so the sight is fortified in him, and by a consequence he doth see better and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> with one eye, being shut, then both being open.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why doe such as drinke much and laugh much, shed teares?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because that whilest they drinke, the aire which is drawn in doth not passe out through the windpipe, and so with force is directed &amp; sent to the eyes, passing out by the eyes, and so dooth expell the humors of the eyes, the which humors being so expulsed, doe bring teares.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because (saith <hi>Aristotle</hi>) that the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicall humiditie of a teare and of vrine, are of one and the same nature. And therefore where wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping doth increase, there vrine doth diminish. And that, they be of one nature it is plaine by the taste, because they are both salr.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> By reason of the opilation, and naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines of the sinewes with which wee see. For the temples being destroyed, the strength of the sight cannot bee carried from the braine vnto the eye. As the Phisolopher doth teach, <hi>lib. de sens. &amp; sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sato.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why is the eye cleere and smooth, like vnto a glasse?</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:8773:12"/>
                  <hi>Answere.</hi> Because the things which may bee seene, are better beaten back from a smooth thing then otherwise, that thereby the sight should bee strengthened.</p>
               <p>Secondly I answere, it is because the eye is very moist, aboue all the parts of the body, and of a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trish nature. And as the water is cleere &amp; smooth, so likewise the eye.</p>

               <p>Question. <hi>Why doth the eyes of a woman which hath her flowers, staine a newe glasse, as Aristotle saith, De som. &amp; vigil. And this is the like probleme, why doth the Basilisque kill a man with his sight?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> To the first, the answere is, that when the flowers doe runne from the woman, then the most venemons ayre is dissolued in the, the which doth ascend vnto the womans head, and she ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing griefe of her head, doth couer it with many vailes and kerchiefes: and because the eyes are full of small vnsensible holes, which are called pores, there the ayre seeketh a passage, and so doth infect the eyes, which are full of bloud. And their eyes doe also appeare dropping, and full of teares, by reason of the euill vapour which is in them, and those vapours are euapourated and multiplied, vntill they come vnto the glasse before them: and by reason that such a glasse is very sound, cleane, and smooth, it doth easily receiue that which is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane.</p>
               <p>To the second it is answered, that the Basilisque is a very venemous and infectious beast, and that there passe from his eyes venemous vapours, the which are multiplied vnto the thing which is seen by him, and cuen vnto the eye of man, the which
<pb facs="tcp:8773:13"/>
venemous vapours or humours entering into the bodies, doe infect them, and so in the end the man dieth. And this is also the reason why the Basi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisque looking vpon a shield perfectly well made with fast clammy pitch, or any hard smooth thing, doth kill himselfe, because the humours are bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten backe from this smooth hard thing vnto the Basilisque, by which beating back he is killed. And the like is sayd of a woman when she hath her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethly disease. Where of it followeth, that some old women doe hurt themselues when they looke v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon glasses, or other firme and solide things in the time of their tearmes.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because that the greater light dooth darken the leiser, and therefore in a greater light that sparkling cannot be seene: but the greater the darknes is, the easlier it is seene, and is made more strong and shining, because it is not then hindered by a greater externall light, which might darken it.</p>

                  </hi> that the image seene by the glasse, doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present it selfe weakly and vndirectly vnto the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the sight: and because it is represented weakely, it is weakely also apprehended, and by a consequence is not long retained.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why is the sight recreated and refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by a greene colour, as this verse doth shew?</hi>

                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because the greene colour doth mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moue the instrument of the sight, and therefore doth comfort the sight: but this doth not blacke or white colour, because these colours do vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly stirre and alter the organe and instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the sight, and therefore make the greater violence: but by how much the more violent the thing is which is felt or seene, the more it doth destroy and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the sence: as <hi>Aristctle</hi> doth teach, 2. <hi>de anima.</hi>

               <head>Of the Nose.</head>
               <p>Question. <hi>WHy doth the nose stand out further then the other parts of the head?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> There are two answers. The first, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the nose is as it were the sinke of the braine, by the which the fleume of the braine is purged. And therefore it dooth stand so foorth, least the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part should be defiled.</p>
               <p>The second, according vnto <hi>Const.</hi> is, because the nose is the beautie of the face, and therefore it doth shew it selfe and shine. It doth smell also and adorne the face, as <hi>Boetius</hi> saith, <hi>De discipl. schol.</hi>

               <p>Question. <hi>Why hath man the worste smell of all other living creatures, as it doth appeare, 2. de a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nima?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because that man, as the Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor saith, in respect of his quantitie bath the most moystest braine of all creatures. And thereforé by that exceeding moystnes and coldnes, the braine wanteth a good disposition, and by a consequence the smelling, seeing the instrument is not good, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Themist.</hi> doe teach. Yea, some
<pb facs="tcp:8773:14"/>
men there be which doe not smell at all.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why doth the Vultur or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because they haue a very dry braine, and therefore the ayre carrying the smell, is not hindered by the humiditie of the braine, but doth presently touch his instrument. And therefore he saith, that the Vultures, Tygers, and other beasts, came 500. miles to the dead bodies after a battade in Greece.</p>
               <p>Question, <hi>Why did nature make the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> For three commodities. First, because that the mouth being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, wee draw breath in by the nosthrils to refresh the heart with. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond commoditie is, because that the ayre which proceedeth from the mouth, dooth fauour badly because it dooth sauour of the vapours which use from the stomack, but that which we breathe from the nose is not so noysome. The third, because the fleume which dooth proceede from the braine is purged by them.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why doe men sneese?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because that the expulsiue vertue or power, and the sight should thereby bee purged, and the braine also from superfluities: because that as the lungs are purged by coughing, so the sight and the braine by sneesing. And those which sneese oft, are sayd to haue a strong braine: and thereupon the Phisitions doe giue sneesing medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments to purge the braine. And such sick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons as cannot sneese, dye quickly, because it is a signe that their braine is wholly stuffed with euill humours which cannot be purged.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:8773:15"/>Question. <hi>Why cannot such as are apoplectikes, sneese, that is, such as are subiect easily to bleed?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because the passage and ventricules of the brain are stopped in them, and if they could sneese, their apoplexie would be loosed.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why doth the heate of the sunne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke sneesing, and not the heate of the fire?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because the heate of the sunne doth onely dissolue, and not consume, and therefore the vapour dissolued is expelled by sneesing: but the heate of the fire doth dissolue and consume, and therfore doth rather consume sneesing, then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke vnto it.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answere.</hi> Because there is in man a certaine muscule neere vnto the iawe, which dooth hinder motion in the eares, and therefore that muscule being extended and stretched, men doe mooue their eares, as it hath bin seene in diuers men: but other beasts want that muscule or fleshy sinewe, and therefore doth moue their eares.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why is raine prognosticated by the pricking vp of the Asses eares?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer</hi> Because the Asse is a very melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beast, and it proceedeth from melancholy that he doth foresee raine to come. In the time of raine all beasts doe pricke vp their eares, and therefore the Asse perceiuing that it will raine, doth pricke
<pb facs="tcp:8773:15"/>

               <p>Question. <hi>Why haue small birds no eares?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer Aristotle</hi> dooth answere, and say, that nature dooth giue vnto euery thing that which is fit for it. But if she should haue giuen birds eares, their flying would haue been hindered. Likewise fish doe want eares, because they would hinder their swimming, and haue onely certaine little holes, through which they doe heare, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> doth declare by the sea calfe.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why haue Bats eares, seaing they doe seeme to be birds?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because they are partly birds in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in that they doe flye, by reason where of they haue wings: and partly they are of the nature of foure footed beasts, and in that respect they are hairie, because they are mise, and therefore nature as being wise, gaue them eares.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why hath onely man round eares?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because the shape of the whole and of the parts should be proportionable, and especially in things of one nature: for as a drop of water is rounde, so the whole water, as <hi>Iohn de sacre Rosco</hi> doth proue. And so because mans head is round, the eares incline towards the same figure: but the heads of other beasts are somewhat long, and so their eares are drawne into length also.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why did nature giue liuing creatures eares?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answere.</hi> For two causes. First, because that with them they should heare. Secondly, because that by the eares cholerike superfluitie is purged: for as the head is purged from fleugmatike super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluitie
<pb facs="tcp:8773:16"/>
by the nose, so from cholerike by the eares.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> According vnto <hi>Const.</hi> because the lips doe couer and defend the teeth: for it were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seemely that the teeth should alwaies be seene. An other answer is, that the teeth are of a cold nature, and would therefore bee easily hurt, if they were not couered with the lippes.

               <p>Question. <hi>Why hath man two eares, and two eyes, and but one mouth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because a man should speak but little, and see and heare much. And withall, <hi>Aristotle</hi> doth say, that the hearing is the sence with which learning is gotten. And hee sayth, that the sight doth shew vs the difference of many things. And <hi>Senecae</hi> doth agree vnto this, affirming, that nature hath enuironed the tongue with a double cloister, the teeth and lips, and hath made the eares open and wide, and hath giuen vs but one mouth, to speake little, though we heare much.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> For many commodities. First, because the mouth is the gate and doore of the stomacke. Secondly, because the meate is chewed in the mouth, and prepared and made readie for the first
<pb facs="tcp:8773:16"/>
digestion Although <hi>Autcen</hi> doth hold that the first digestion is made in the mouth. Thirdly, because that the aire drawne into the hollow of the mouth for the refreshing of the heart, is made more pure and subtile. And for many other causes, which shal hereafter appeare.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answere.</hi> Because of forming the voyce and wordes, which can not bee perfectly done with out them. For as without <hi>a, b, c,</hi> there is no writing, so without the lips no voyce can well be formed.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why doe men gape?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> The glosse vpon the last part of <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates Aphorisures</hi> sayth, that it proceedeth of wearisomnes, as when a man sitteth among such as he doth not knowe, whose companie he could willingly want.</p>
               <p>Secondly, gaping is caused of the thicke fumes which fill the iawes, by the expulsion of the which is caused the stretching out and extension of the iawes, and opening of the mouth, and then a man doth gape.</p>

               <p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because that, according vnto <hi>Aristotle,</hi> all other bones are ingendered of the humiditie which is called radicall, and so they breede in the wombe of the mother: but the teeth are ingende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of nutritiue humiditie, which is renewed and increased from day to day.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> This proceedeth of the defect of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and of the figure, because the foreteeth are sharpe, and the others broad. But according vnto <hi>Aristotle,</hi> there is another answer: that is, that it is
<pb facs="tcp:8773:17"/>
the office of the foreteeth to cut the meate, and therefore they are sharpe: and the office of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers is to chew the meate, and therefore they are broad in fashion, which is fittest for that purpose.</p>

               </p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> According vnto <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his booke <hi>de animal.</hi> hornes and teeth are caused of the selfe
<pb facs="tcp:8773:18"/>
same matter, that is, of nutrimental humiditie, and therefore the matter which passeth into hornes, turneth not into teeth, and therefore the vpper teeth want. And such beasts, according vnto <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle,</hi> cannot chew wel: whereupon for want of teeth they haue two stomackes by a consequence, and so doe chew their meate twise: and they doe first conuey their meate into their first stomacke or belly, and then returne it from whence it came and chew it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Nature dooth not want in things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie, nor abound in things superfluous: and therefore because these beasts not long after they are fallen do need teeth, are fallen with teeth: but men are nourished with the mothers dugge for a time and therefore for a time want teeth.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because the matter of teeth passeth into their beake, and therefore there is their dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion: or els it is answered, that although they doe not chewe with teeth, yet they chewe with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments belonging vnto them.</p>

                  <hi>Answer.</hi> According vnto <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist. 2. de anim.</hi> because the tongue is the meane whereby wee taste, and through the mouth into

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because the stomacke of such persons is filled with cholerike humours, and choler is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bitter, as it appeareth by the gall, and therfore this bitter fume doth infect the tongue, and so the tongue being full of these taste, doth iudge them bitter, although the bitternes be not in the meats, but in the tongue.</p>

                  <hi>Answere.</hi> This happeneth for many causes. Sometimes through the moystnes of the tongue and braine, as in children, which cannot speake plainly, nor pronounce many letters. Sometime it happeneth by reason of the shrinking of certaine

               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> This is by reason of some secret pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie, or els it may be sayd, that the tongue of a dogge is full of many pores, and so doth draw and take away the viscositie of the wound. Some say that a dogge hath by nature some humours in his tongue, with the which by licking he doth heale, and the contrary is in a horse.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> This doth proceede of a fleugmadke complexion, which dooth predominate in them: and therefore the Phisitions doe say, that such should take heeds of a quotidian ague, which ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth of the predomination of flume. The contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is in those which spet little, because heate dooth abound in them, which doth consume the humidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of spettle, and so the defect of spettle is a signe of a feuer.</p>

                  <hi>Answer.</hi> The answer, according vnto the Phisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is, because the peccant matter lyeth in the head: but if he do vomite, then the matter is in the stomacke: but if they vrine much, then the matter is in the passage of the vrine: but if they begin to haue seede, then it is in the vessels of the seed, and according vnto this the Phisitions do purge them.</p>

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The answer is out of <hi>Hippoc.</hi> that this doth happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> through a palsie, or apoplexie, that is, a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> efffusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of bloud, &amp; of a grosse humor.

               <p>Q. <hi>WHy are fruits, before they be ripe, of a naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie relish, or bitter, and afterward sweet?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> A naughtie relish in taste proceedeth of cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes &amp; want of heat in grosse &amp; thick humidity but a sweete taste proceedeth of sufficient heate. And therefore in ripe fruite the humiditie is subtile through the heate of the sunne, &amp; therefore such fruits are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly sweet: but before they be ripe the humiditie is grosse, and not subtile, for want of heat, &amp; therfore then the fruits are bitter &amp; sowre.</p>
               <p>Quest. <hi>Why be we rather delighted with sweete tastes, then with bitter, or any other?</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:8773:20"/>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Because nature is delighted with sweetnes. The reason is, because a sweete thing is hot and moist, and through his heat, it doth dissolue super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous humidities, &amp; by his humiditie the immu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie is washed away: but a sharp eger taste, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the cold which doth predominate in it, doth bind ouer much, &amp; prick, &amp; offendeth the parts of the body in purging. And therefore we do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in that taste, because the Phisitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s counsel vs to eate nothing which is bitter in the summer, not in a great heat: and the reason is, because bitternes doth breed heat: but we should eate bitter things in winter onely. And therefore <hi>Aristotle</hi> doth say, that sweet things are gratefull vnto nature &amp; doe greatly nourish.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because it is cold and doth coole. Now it is the nature of colde to desire, and drawe, and therfore is cause of appetite.

                     </gap> cordis</hi> do answer, that much ayre is drawne in, &amp; is turned into a nutriment, &amp; with the virall spirits is contained in the lungs. And therfore a beast is not suffocated so long as he receiueth ayre with the lu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs, in which some part of the aire remaineth also.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why doth the aire seeme to be expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and put foorth seeing that indeede the aire is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisible by reason of his raritie and thinnes?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because that the ayre which is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued into vs, is mingled with vapors and fumosities
<pb facs="tcp:8773:21"/>
of the heart, by reason whereof it is made thicke and so is seene. And this is proued by experience, because that in winter wee see our breath, because the coldnes of the ayre dooth binde the breath mixed with fumosities, and so it is thickened and made grosse, and by a consequence it is seene.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> The answere is, according to the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, because there doth arise euill fumes from the stomacke: and sometime it proceedeth of the corruption of the spirituall parts of the body, as of the lungs. And the breath of leapers is so infected, that it doth poyson the birds which are neere vnto them, because their inwarde parts are very cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, as it appeareth by <hi>Const. defin.</hi> because that leprosie is a nourishment of all the parts of the bodie, together with the corrupting of them: and it dooth begin in the bloud, and end in the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the body.</p>

                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because of a rheume desceding from the braine, filling the conduites of the lights: or somtimes through some importumes in the throte or rheume gathered in the necke.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why haue all the femall of all liuing creatures the shrillest voyces, a cowe onely excepted, and a woman shriller then a man and smaller?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> According vnto <hi>Aristotle,</hi> by reason of the composition of the vaines, and vocall arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<pb facs="tcp:8773:21"/>
that is, where the ayre doth enter in, by which vaines and arteries the voyce is formed: as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by a similitude, because a small pipe dooth sound shriller then a great. And so also in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, because the passage where the voyce is founded, is made narrow and strait, by reason of cold because it is the nature of colde to binde: but in men that passage is open and wider through heate, because it is the propertie of heare to open and dissolve. Also it proceedeth in women through the moyst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the lungs and weakenes of heate. Young men and diseased men haue sharpe and shrill voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for the same cause. And that is the naturall cause why a mar-child at his birth time dooth crie <hi>a, i,</hi> which is a bigger sound, &amp; the femalle, which is a slenderer sound, as it pleaseth <hi>Laberintus,</hi> whe he sayth, <hi>Masculus a proferr.</hi>

               <p>Question. <hi>Why doth the voyce chaunge in men and women, in men at 14 in women at 12. in men, when they begin to yeeld seede, in women when their breasts begin to grow, as Aristotle dooth say, lib. de animal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because that then, sayth <hi>Aristotle,</hi> the beginning of the voyce is slackened and loosed: and he proueth this by a similitude of a firing of an instrument let downe or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which giueth a greater sound. And he proueth it another way, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that beasts which are gelded, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>Question. <hi>Why doe men become hoarse, by the looking of a woolfe?</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:8773:22"/>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> The answer, according vnto <hi>Aristotle</hi> is, because a wolse is a very cold beast in the brain, and thereupon hath a very heavie head. If then the spirit of the sight or be ames be directed &amp; goe towards the wolfe, it doth draw some coldnes from him to the breast, and then of that coldnes the breast is straightened, where the instruments are, by which the voyce is formed: because a wolfe can not send foorth any other fumosities, and they are breathed out into the ayre, that ayre next vnto him is infected, and the next aire by that aire, and so another aire, vntill it come vnto the man: then that ayre being infected, is drawne in by man, and so doth make him hoarse, by closing the vocall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie or windpipe. And it hath been alreadie sayd that a woolfe is a very rauenous and deuouring beast, and doth eate as much at once as will serue him for three dayes, and therefore by opening his mouth doth cast foorth rawe and grosse humours vndigested, by the which the next ayre vnto him is infected, and so the next vnto it, vntill it come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the looker on, and so dooth infect like the Basi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisque, which dooth cast foorth venemous ayres, which infect men by the eyes.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why is not a wolfe hoarse when a man doth looke on him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because a man is not so cold as a wolfe, nor of so malignant a qualitie. And for the like reason this probleme is moued.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why doth a man which is staine, bleed when he is seene of him which killed him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> This proceedeth of a diuine cause, and not of a naturall, because his bloud dooth call for
<pb facs="tcp:8773:22"/>
reuenge against the murtherer. But if there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny naturall cause of it, this is it. The committer of this wicked fact calling it to minde, is verie sorie for it and repenteth him of it, and is in anguisn of mind, and in a great heat, through the strong ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination which he hath conceiued, and by that meanes all his spirits doe stirre and boyle and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire vnto the instruments of the sight, and so goe out by the beames of the sight of the eies vnto the wounds which are made, the which if they bee fresh, doe presently fall a bleeding.

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Because the spirits of small birds is lighter and greater then the spirits of great birds, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore follow easily any desire, &amp; so do sing very oft.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> It proceedeth from the desire of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall copulation, because that then the spirits are moued throughout all the body with the foresayd appetite and desire. And speaking generally, the females are colder then the males.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> According vnto <hi>Aristotle,</hi> there is in them a certaine small skinne, agaynst the which when the ayre doth strike, it causeth that sound, &amp;

               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because a chicken and such like, haue straite sinewes, and therefore the spirit of mouing continueth long after the head is off: but men and other beastes haue long and large sinewes and vaines, &amp; therefore the motiue spirits doth quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> According vnto the Phisitions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause a man which is fasting is full of bad humors, and diuers fumosities, which puffe vp the parts of the body, and the fingers also: but when those hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors are expulsed through meate, the fingers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more slender. And for the same reason, a man which is fasting is heauier then when he hath meate in his belly, as it is most plaine in fasters. Another reason may be giuen, that is, because that after meate, the heat departeth from the outward parts of the body vnto the inward, to helpe dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, and therefore the outward and externall
<pb facs="tcp:8773:25"/>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because milke is easily conuerted into great fumosities, and hath much terrestriall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in it, the which fumosities ascending, dooth cause the head to ake.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because it is their naturall and vsuall foode, and because they were nourished with the same in the wombe of the mother, it is fit for them.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because the milke is at that time very spongie, and dooth expell many fumosities, and doth as it were purge at that time.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because that in the time of carnall copulation, the subtilest and best part of the milke goeth to the vessels of the seede, and vnto the wombe, and the worst remaineth in the pappes, which doth hurt the child.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because that browne women are hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then others, and because the heate doth purge the milke sufficiently, and so the milke is the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because pappes would hinder their flying: and fish also haue neither paps nor milke, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> doth say: but in fishes the female doth cast many egges, vpon which the male doth touch with a small gut, which causeth their kind to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit in succession.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> According vnto <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:8773:29"/>
for three causes. First, because the backe should be the way &amp; meane of the sinewes, which are extended and spred throughout all the bodie from the back bone, as it appeareth in such as are hanged, because that when they are torne in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or without flesh, the sinewes hang whole in the chine or backe bone. The second, because it should be a garde and defence for the soft parts of the body, as of the stomacke, liuer, lights, and such like. The third, because it should bee the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the bones, because wee see other bones, as the ribbes, fastened in the backe bone.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why hath a man aboue all creatures a broad backe, which he can lie vpon, which no beast can doe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Because a broad back doth answer a broad breast. If therefore a man should haue a sharpe backe like vnto other beasts, that would bee of an vnseemely shape, and therefore it is requisite that he haue a broad backe.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why hath a man which lieth on his backe horrible visions?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because then the passage or sinewe of the fantasie is open, which is in the forepart of the braine, and so the fantasie is destroyed, and then those visions followe. Another reason is, because that when a man doeth lve on his backe, the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours are disturbed, and moued vpward where the fantasie is, which is so by that meanes distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why is it naught to lie on the backe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because, as the Phisitions do say, that doth dispose a man to a leprosie, madnes, and to
<pb facs="tcp:8773:30"/>
an <hi>Intubus.</hi> Where you may note, that <hi>Mania</hi> or madnes is the hurt or disturba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the forepart of the braine, with a taking away or depriuation of the imagination: but <hi>Incubus,</hi> that is, the night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mare, is a passion of the heart, when a man dooth thinke himselfe to bee strangled in his sleepe, and some what lie heauie vpon his stomacke, which he would put off.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why hath the backe bone manie ioynts &amp; knuckles, called Spondylia by the Phisitions?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> For the mouing of the backe, and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing of him, without the which ioynts that could not be done. And therefore they say amisse which say that Elephants haue no such ioynts: for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them he could not moue.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why doe fish dye presently when their backe bone is burst?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because that in fish the backe bone is in steede of the heart. Now the heart is the first thing which dooth liue, and the last thing which doth dye, as it appeareth in the book <hi>de longit. &amp; breuit. vitae,</hi> and therefore when that bone is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leen, fish can liue no longer.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because the marrowe doth proceede from the braine, which is a principall part of man, as it appeareth in two reasons. First, because the marrow is white like vnto the braine. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, because
<pb facs="tcp:8773:30"/>
they haue a small skin or rinde, which that which is called <hi>Nucha</hi> hath not, which dooth somewhat differ from the marrow, because that <hi>Nucha</hi> hath two couerings like the braine, called <hi>Ptamater, &amp; Dura mater.</hi>

               <p>Question. <hi>WHy haue some men the piles? Answer.</hi> Because they are me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholike, the which melancholy first passeth to the spleene, which is the proper seate of melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, and there cannot bee retayned through a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of bloud: and therefore from thence it is carried to the backe bone, where there are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vaines which haue their end in the back and in the necke. And when those vaines are very full of melancholy bloud, then the waies &amp; conduits of nature are opened, and that bloud issueth our once a moneth like a womans rearmes or flowers.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The Diuines do say, because they cried at the death of Christ, <hi>Let his bloudfall vpon vs and our children.</hi> And therefore it is sayd in the Psalm, <hi>Percussit eos Deus in posterior a dorsi.</hi> Another rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is, because the Iewes do eate much fleugmatike &amp; cold meats, which doth breed mela<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>choly bloud, which is purged by this fiuxe of bloud. Another reason is, because mouing doth cause heat, &amp; heat

digestion, as 4. <hi>Meteor.</hi> but the Iewes doe not moue nor labour, nor conuerse with men.

               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> From this word <hi>Spiritus,</hi> which signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth breath, life, or soule, and because the vitall spirits are ingendred in the heart: but that is no good answer, for so the liuer and the braine might bee so called, which is false: because the liuer is a part which giueth nouriture, and the braine sence and life. And yet the consequence is cleere, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the vitall spirits are ingendered in the liuer, and the sensible or animall spirits in the braine. And therefore the answere is, because that in the heart and in the lungs breath and ayre is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, by which we liue.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>VVhy are the lungs thinne and spungie, light and full of small holes?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because the ayre might be the better receiued in them, for the cooling of the heart, and expelling of superfluous humours, because the lungs are the fanne of the heart. And as a paire of bellowes is puffed vp by taking in of the ayre, and
<pb facs="tcp:8773:31"/>
shrinketh by blowing out the ayre: so like wise the lights do draw aire when they coole the heart and cast it out, least through too much heate the heart should be suffocated.</p>

               </p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because the lungs be no part for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, but for another, that is, for the heart: and therefore it were superfluous for those beasts to haue lungs which haue no heart: but nature doth neuer want in things necessary, nor abound in su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because such drinke no water, to the end to make their meate to boile, or to helpe dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, but onely for the tempering of their meate, and therefore they want a bladder and vrine, as it appeareth in such birds as doe not drinke at all, as the Falcon, Sparrow hawke.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because it should impart life vnto all the parts of the bodie: and therefore is compared vnto the Sunne, which is placed in the middle of the planets, to powre light vnto them all. And therefore the Pythagorians calling the Heauen a great liuing creature, say, that the Sunne is the heart of him.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> To the end that the heate of the heart should mitigate the coldnes of the spleene: for the spleene is the seate of melancholy, which is seated in the left side likewise.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Why is the heart first ingendred? for according vnto Aristotle, the heart doth first liue and last dye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

Note, according vnto the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers, that of the seede retayned in the matrix or wombe, there is first ingendred a certaine little small skin, which doth compasse the seede, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of first the heart is made of the purest bloud, then of a bloud not so pure, the liuer, and of a thick and cold bloud the marrow and the braine.</p>

                  <hi>Answer.</hi> According vnto <hi>Arist. de motu cordis,</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> because that in him there is bred a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine spirite which is more subtile then the ayre,
<pb facs="tcp:8773:32"/>
which by reason of his great thinnes and rare fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, dooth seeke a larger space, filling the hollowe roome of the heart, whereof the dilating and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the heart dooth follow. And because the heart is earthly, that thrusting and mouing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, his partes are at rest, and tend downwards. And <hi>Galen</hi> giueth an experiment of an acorne, the which if he be put into the fire, the heare doth dissolue his humiditie into smoake, which is thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and greater then the humiditie, and therefore doth occupie a greater place, and so cannot abide in the rinde, but dooth pusse it vp, and cause it to fall into the fire. The like is of the heart: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore note that the heart of a liuing creature is three square after a sort, and hath the least part to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the left side, and the greatest towards the right, and doth alwaies open and shut in the least part, and by that meanes is in continuall mouing. The first mouing is called of the Phisitions <hi>Diasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le,</hi> that is, the extending of the breast or heart. The second, <hi>Sistole,</hi> that is, the shutting of the heart: and of these two mouings all the mouings of the bodie doe proceede, and the mouing of the pulse which the Phisitions doe seele.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because the naturall heate procceding from the heart, doth consurne the waterish humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie, which should be conuerted into fat. And for the most part women are fatter then men, because they haue much humiditie in them, and haue a moyster heart then men.</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:8773:33"/>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because that in a thicke compacted substance, heate is strongly receiued and vnited, as it appeareth in other things. And because the hart with his heate should moderate the coldnes of the braine, it is made of that fast flesh apt to keepe a strong heate.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answer</hi> Because it is so compacted, it receiueth heate best, and because it should mitigate the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the braine, as is sayd.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>VVhy is the heart the beginning of life?</hi>

                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because that in him the vitall spirit is bred, which is the seate of life. And therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording vnto the opinion of <hi>August. de different. spirit. &amp; animae.</hi> the heart hath two bellies or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacles, that is, the right and the left: the right hath more bloud then spirit, the which spirit is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred to giue life, and to viuific at all the body.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> The round figure hath no angles, and therefore the heart is round, for feare least any noysome and hurtfull matter should bee kept and retained in him. And also, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> dooth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, because the round figure is fittest for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

the heart dooth not receiue bloud of any other part, but other parts of him.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>VVhy doe some beasts want a heart?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Although they haue no heart, yet they haue somwhat which doth answer vnto the heart, as it dooth appeare in fish, and celes, which haue the backe bone in steed of the heart.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why doth the heart beate and liue in some beasts when the head is off, as it appeareth in birds and in hennes?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because the vitall spirits doe remaine lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gest in the heart, because the heart is that which is first aliue and last dead, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> doth say, and therefore the heart dooth beate more then other parts.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why do all beasts which want a heart, or somewhat proportionable vnto it, want bloud al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, as it appeareth in flyes?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The heart is the beginning of bloud, and therefore the cause sayling the effect doth fayle.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why is the pulse of the heart more certainly iudged in the right side, then in the left?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because the heat of the heart is more liuely there then in the other side, and therefore it is better felt there, then in the other side.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why doth the heate of the heart faile sometimes on a sudden, as in those which haue the falling sicknes?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> This dooth proceede according vnto <hi>Constant.</hi> through the defect of the hart it self, and of small skinnes with the which it is couered, the which being infected or corrupted, the heart fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth on a sudden: and sometime it doth happen by
<pb facs="tcp:8773:34"/>
reason of the parts next adioyning. And therefore when any venemous humour doth goe out of the mouth of the stomacke, that dooth hurt the heart, and the parts adioyning, the which doth also cause this fainting. Note according vnto <hi>Aristotle,</hi> that the disposition of the heart is knowne by the pulse of the heart, because a swift great beating pulse, doth giue witnes of the heate of the heart and of a good complexion. A slow and weake pulse dooth betoken the coldnes of the heart and an euil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion. And therfore a woman which is in health hath a slower and weaker pulse then a man, as it shall appeare hereafter.</p>

               <p>Question. <hi>WHy is the stomacke large and wide?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because that in the stomacke the meate is first concocted and dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, as it were in a pot, to the end that that which is pure should be separated from that which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> sayth: and therefore according vnto the quantitie of meate the stomacke is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged.</p>

               </p>

                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because that if it had angles and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as <hi>Const.</hi> sayth, the meate would remaine in them, and a man should neuer want agues: the which humours neuerthelesse are lifted vp and consumed, and are not hidden in those corners, by reason of the roundnes of the stomacke.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why is the stomacke full of sinewes
<pb facs="tcp:8773:34"/>
and feeling?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> As <hi>Aristotle</hi> dooth say, because the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes can bee extended and inlarged, and so the stomacke is when it is full, and when it is hungrie it is drawne together, and therefore nature hath prouided those sinewes.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why doth the stomacke digest?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> By reason of the heate which is in him, the which heate commeth from the parts adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that is, the liuer and the heart. For wee see that in metals the heate of the fire dooth take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the rust and drosse from the yron, and siluer from tinne, and gold from copper: and so by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion the pure is separated from the impure. And that digestion is of foure sorts, according vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Phisitions.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why is the stomacke ioyned vnto the liuer?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because, sayth <hi>Const</hi> the liuer is very hot, and with his heate doth helpe digestion, and doth compasse the stomacke.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>VVhy be wee commonly colder after dinner then before?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because that then all the heate goeth to the stomacke to further digestion, and so the outward parts be cold, being depriued of heate.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why is it hurtfull to studie presently after dinner?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because that when the heate doth la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to helpe the imagination in studie, then it ceaseth from digesting the meat, and so the meate remaineth raw. And therefore according vnto the Phisitions a man shuld walk somwhat after dinner.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:8773:35"/>Question. <hi>Why haue women with child an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate appetite of eating coales, ashes, and such like?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because that such as are the humours in the stomacke, such nutriment they desire: and because women with childe haue corrupted hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, they desire such things, because like dooth couer his like.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why doth the stomacke slowly digest very fat meate?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because such meates doe swimme in the stomack. Now the best digestion is in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the stomacke, where fat meate commeth not. And therefore such as eate fat meate are very sleepie after the eating of it, because their dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is hindered.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why is all the bodie the worse when the stomacke is ill at ease?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because the stomacke is knit with the braine, heart and liuer, which are the principall parts in man, and therefore when he is not well, the others are euilly disposed. Another answer is, that if the first digestion bee hindered, the others are also hindered: for in the first digestion is the beginning of the infirmitie that is in the stomack.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why are young men sooner a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred then old men?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Young men doe digest for three cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. First for growing: then for restoring of life: and lastly, for conseruation of their life, as <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> dooth say. Els wee answere, that yong men are hotter then old men, because yong men are hot and drie, and therefore the heat doth
<pb facs="tcp:8773:35"/>
digest more, and by a consequent they desire more.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why doe Phisitions prescribe that a man should eate when he hath an appetite?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because much hunger and emptines dooth fill the stomacke with naughtie rotten hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, which he doth draw vnto himselfe in steede of meate: which doth easily appeare, because that if we fast ouer night, we haue an appetite to meat, but in the morning none. That is therefore a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken that the stomacke is filled with naughtie hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, and especially his mouth, which is no true filling, but a deceitfull. And therfore after we haue eaten a little, our stomack commeth to vs againe. And therefore the common prouerbe is, that the mouth is a deceiuer: for although he were cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with bad humours, yet after meate the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite commeth againe.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why doe the Phisitions prescribe, that we should not eate too much at a time, but by little and a little?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because that when the stomacke is full, the meate dooth swimme in him, which is a dangerous thing. Another reason is, that as very greene wood doth put out the fire, so dooth much meate choke the naturall heat and put it out. And therefore the best phisicke is to vse temperancy in eating and drinking.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why doe we desire change of meates, according vnto the chaunge of times? as in winter, beefe, porke, mutton: in summer, lighter meates, as veale, lambe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because the complexion of the bodie
<pb facs="tcp:8773:36"/>
is altered and chaunged, according vnto the time of the yeare. Another answere is, that this doth proceede from the qualitie of the season, because that the cold of the winter doth cause a better di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion, because the stomacke and belly is hotter in winter, by reason of the compassing colde, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Aristotle</hi> doth teach.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why should not the meate we eate be too hot, as Pepper, Ginger?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because that hot meate dooth burne the bloud, and doth dispose vnto a leprosie. So con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise, meate too colde doth mortifie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geale the bloud. Also our meate should not be ouer sharpe, because it procureth olde age: and ouer much sauce dooth burne the intrailes, and procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth often drinking, as raw meate doth: and ouer sweete meates do constipate and clinge the vaines together.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why is it a good custome to eate cheese after dinner, and peares after all meate?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because that cheese, by reason of his earthlines and thicknes, tendeth downe toward the bottome of the stomack, and so putteth downe the meate: and the like is of peares. Note that newe cheese is better then olde, and old drie salt cheese is very naught, and procureth the head-ach and stopping of the liuer, and the older the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser. Whereupon it is sayd, that cheese is naught, and digesteth all things but it selfe.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why be nuttes good after fish: as the verse is:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>After fish nuttes, after flesh cheese.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because fish is of a hard digestion, and
<pb facs="tcp:8773:36"/>
doth easily putrifie and corrupt, and nuttes doe helpe digestion, because they are somewhat hot. Also fish is poyson at some times, and nuttes are a remedie against poyson. And note that the fish should be of a cleere stony water, and not of a cold standing muddie water, and should be sod in wine with parsly, and so it doth least hurt.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why is it vnholesome to stay long for one dish after another, and eate of diuers kindes of meates?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because it beginneth to digest when the last is eaten, and so the digestion is not equally made, and therfore it is good to vse but few dishes. But yet this rule is to be noted touching the order of meates, that if there bee many dishes, whereof some are light in digestion, as chickens, kid, veale, soft egges, and such like, these meates should bee first eaten: but the grosse meates, as venison, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, beefe, rosted porke, hard egges, and fried egs, should bee eaten last. And the reason is, because that if they should be first serued and eaten, if they were digested, they would hinder the digestion of the others: and the light meates not digested, should be corrupted in the stomacke, and be kept in the stomacke violently. Whereof there would follow belching, loathing, head-ach, belly-ach, and great thirst. And by a consequent it is very hurtful to at the same meale, to eate milke, and drinke wine, because they dispose a man to a leprosie.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Which is better for the stomack meat or drinke?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Drinke is sooner digested then meat, because meate is of greater substance and more
<pb facs="tcp:8773:37"/>
materiall then drinke, and therefore meate is har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to digest.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why is it good to drinke at dinner?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because the drinke should make the meate readier to digest. For if a pot be filled with flesh or fish without liquour, then both the meare and the pot is marred. And the stomacke is like vnto a pot which doth boyle meate: and therfore the Phisitions do giue counsell to drink at meales.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why is it good to forbeare a late sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because there is no mouing nor stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring after supper, &amp; so the meate is not sent downe to the bottome of the stomack, but remayneth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digested, and so breedeth hurt. And therefore a light and short supper is best, as the olde verse doth.</p>

               <p>Question. <hi>Why is it hurtfull to drinke much cold water?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because one contrary doth expel and hinder another; but the water is very colde, and therefore comming vnto the stomacke doth hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der digestion, and the heate which doth digest.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why is it vnholesome to drinke new wine, and why dooth it hurt the stomacke verie much?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because it cannot bee digested: and therefore it doth cause the belly to swell, and so it
<pb facs="tcp:8773:37"/>
doth in sorne sorte cause a bloudie flixe: it dooth also hinder making of water: but to drinke good wine is holesome.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why do the Phisitions forbid vs to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour presently after dinner?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> For three causes. First, because mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing doth hurt the vertue and power of digestion, and by that meanes the meare is expelled vndi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested. The second is, because stirring immediatly after dinner doth cause the parts of the bodie to draw the meate raw vnto them, which doth breed sicknes. The third, because mouing doth cause the meate to descend before it bee digested: but after supper it is good to stirre and moue, because wee sleepe not long after. And therefore wee should walke a little, because the meate may goe to the bottome of the stomacke.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why is it good to walk in the morning before dinner?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because it maketh a man well dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and dooth fortifie and strengthen the naturall heate, and causeth the superfluitie of the stomack to descéd. And therfore <hi>Auicen</hi> doth say, that such as forgoe this exercise, doe fall into the inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the heart.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because it doth purge the stomacke of all naughtie humours: for it dooth expell greene and blew humours, which would breede agues, if they should remaine in the stomacke. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto <hi>Autcen,</hi> a vomite dooth purge the eyes, the head, and make the braine cleane.</p>

                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because that in sleepe the heate doth drawe inward, and dooth helpe the digestion: but when we be awake, the heate doth remaine about the sences, &amp; is dispersed throughout all the body.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because that chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rike humors are receiued in it, the which through their sharpnes do help the guts to expel superflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, it doth also helpe the stomacke in digesting.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because the humor of the gall is blew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish and yellowe: and therefore when the pores of the gall are stopped, then that humor cannot goe into the sacke or bladder of the gall, but is mingled with the bloud, wandring throughout al the body, and infecting the skinne.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Because it is caused of a terrestriall and earthly matter, that is, of a blacke substance, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> doth say. Now the effect is like vnto the cause. Another answer is according vnto the Phisitions, because the spleene is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle of melancholy, and melancholy is of a blacke colour.</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:8773:39"/>Question. <hi>Why is a man leane which hath a great spleene?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because the spleene doth draw much matter vnto himselfe, which should goe into fat. And therefore contratiwise, men which haue but a small spleene are fat.</p>
               <p>Quest. <hi>Why doth the spleene cause men to laugh? as Isidorus doth say; we laugh with the spleene, wee be angrie with the gall, we are wise with the heart, we loue with the liuer, and we feele with the braine, &amp; speake with the lungs: that is, the cause of laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, anger, loue, wisedome, and speech, and feeling, doth proceed from the spleene, the gall the liuer, the heart, the lungs, and the braine?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> The reason is, because the spleene doth drawe much melancholy vnto it, because it is his proper seat, the which melancholy is cause of sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and is there consumed, and so the cause fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, the effect faileth. And that melancholy is cause of sadnes, it appeareth in <hi>Arist. in Proem. de anima.</hi> and therefore that being consumed, the contrary vnto sadnes doth follow, that is, ioye and gladnes. And for the same cause the gall causeth anger: for cholerike men are angrie, because they haue much gall. For the better vnderstanding of this, note that there be foure humors in man, that is, bloud, choler, fleume, and melancholy: whereof each hath a speciall receptacle and place where it is receiued and kept. Of a drie and hot substance choler is ingendred, which goeth vnto the gall, as to his seate and place. But of a colde and drie hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour melancholy is ingendred, which runneth to the spleene as to his peculiar place &amp; receptacle.
<pb facs="tcp:8773:40"/>
But of a colde and moyst humour fleume is bred, which goeth vnto the lungs, as vnto his recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle, or as the Phisitions doe say, vnto the spleene. But the bloud which is the most noblest humour, is ingendred in the liuer, and there his proper place doth seeme to be.</p>

               <head>Of carnall copulation.</head>
               <p>Question. <hi>WHy doe liuing creatures vse car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall copulation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because it is the most naturall worke which is in liuing creatures, to beget the like vnto themselues in kinde, to continue the kinde. For if carnall copulation were not, all kinde of liuing creatures had before this time perished.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>What is this carnall copulation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> It is a mutuall action of the male and female, with instruments ordayned and deputed for that act, to maintayne the kind. And therefore the Diuines do say, that it is a sin to vse that act for any end, but for begetting his like in kind.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why is this action good in those to whom it is lawfull, if it be moderatly taken?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because that according vnto <hi>Auicen</hi> and <hi>Const.</hi> it doth ease and lighten the body, cheere the minde, comfort the head and the sence, take away many griefes of melancholy, because it doth expell the fume of the seede from the braine, and it doth expel the matter of impostume. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore sometimes, through the intermitting of this act, the darknes of the fight doth ensue, and a gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines
<pb facs="tcp:8773:40"/>
in the head. And therefore the seede of a man retayned aboue a due time, is conuerted into some infectious humour.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why is immoderate carnall copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hurtfull?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because it doth destroy the fight, and drie the bodie: because that as <hi>Aristotle</hi> sayth, <hi>2 de gen. anim.</hi> lecherie and in continencie is the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting of the pure humiditie, and doth consurne the braine: and it breedeth sharpe feuers, as <hi>Auicen</hi> teacheth, and as experience doth shew. And doth shorten the life of man, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith, <hi>de longit. &amp; breuit. vitae.</hi> And <hi>Albertus</hi> doth shew this in the sparrowe, which by reason of his often coupling, doth liue but three yeares.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why dooth carnall copulation verie much hurt to melancholy men, and cholericke men, and generally to leane men?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because it dooth drie the bones very much, which are drie of themselues. And contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwise, it is good for the fleugmatike and sanguine, as <hi>Auicen</hi> sayth, because they abound with that substance, which by nature is necessarily expelled. Although <hi>Aristotle</hi> dooth affirme, that euery fat creature hath but small store of seede, because the substance of it doth turne into fatnes.</p>
               <p>Quest. <hi>Why doe not the female of brute beasts couet carnal coupling, after they be great with yong?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because that then the wombe or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix is shut, and the flowers cease, and therfore the desire vnto the act doth cease.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why should not this act be vsed when the bodie is full?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:8773:41"/>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because it dooth hinder digestion, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> sayth: likewise it is not good for a hungry belly, because it doth weaken him.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why is it not good after a bath?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because that then the pores are open, and the heate dispersed throughout all the bodie: and therefore carnal copulation following a bath, doth coole the body very much.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why is it not good after a vomite, or a loosenes of the belly?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because it is very perilous to purge twise in one day, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> say: but so it is of this act of carnalitie, and loosenes in the belly, because by this act the raines and kidnies are purged, and the guts by the vomite.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why are wild beasts furious whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they couple, as it doth appeare in Harts which bray, and Asses which are then almost mad, as Hippoc. saith?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because their bloud is kindled with the desire of carnall act, &amp; nature also doth labour to expell superfluities in them, which in the sence doe dispose vnto anger and madnes: &amp; therefore after the act done they are tame and gentle.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why is there such delight in the act of venerie?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Because this act is a base &amp; contemptible thing in it selfe, naught and vncleane, so farre that all beasts would naturally abhorre it, if there shuld be no pleasure in it, &amp; so there shuld neuer be any carnall copulation, by reason of the vncleannes of it. And therefore in this delight nature doth wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly practise it, to the end that the kinds of liuing things should be maintained and kept.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:8773:41"/>Question. <hi>Why doe such as vse it oft, take lesser delight in it, then such which come to it seldome?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> For three causes. First, because the passage of the seede is ouer large and wide, and therefore the seed maketh no stay there, by which stay the delight is had. The second, because that through often going together, there is but little seede left, and therefore giueth no delight. The third, because that such in steed of seede cast out bloud vndigested and rawe, or some other waterie substance, which is not hot, and therefore causeth no delight.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why then doth a woman and a mare desire carnall act after they be great, as Arist, doth affirme, lib. de animal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer. Galen</hi> sayth, that the remembrance of it doth further it in a woman: and because she doth remember the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> past in the act, she doth couet it againe. But it proceedeth in a mare, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she is a rauenous beast, and hath many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempered fumosities in her, and therefore desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth new seede, because euery like doth desire his like.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Whether can this carnall copulation bee done by the mouth, so that beasts may conceaue thereby, as some doe say of pigeons, which they say by kissing doe this act at the mouth and conceaue. And some say this to be true in the Weesell or ermine?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> According vnto <hi>Aristotle,</hi> that is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true. For although pigeons doe play by the beake, yet they doe not couple together this way not conceaue. And because the weesell doth beare his young ones from place to place in his mouth they
<pb facs="tcp:8773:42"/>
are of that opinion. And therefore <hi>Aristotle</hi> doth shew it thus: Whatsoeuer goeth in at the mouth, that is consumed by digestion: but if the seede should goe in at the mouth, then it should also bee consumed by digestion. The maior is plaine, nor is no easie instance, and the conclusion dooth hold in <hi>Darij.</hi>

               <p>Question. <hi>WHereof commeth the seede of man?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> There are diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions of Philosophers and Phisitions in this poynt: Some say that it is a superfluous humour of the fourth digestion. And some say that the seede is pure bloud, flowing from the braine, concocted and made white in the stones. And some say that it is the superfluitie of the second or third dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion. But because sweate, vrine, spettle, fleume and choler are the like, <hi>Aristotle</hi> sayth, that the seede is alwayes the superfluitie of the last nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that is, of bloud dispersed throughout al the body: but yet principally it commeth from the principall parts, that is, from the heart, liuer, and braine. And an argument of this is, because that those parts are greatly weakened in the casting out of seed: and thereof it doth appeare, that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall copulation is not profitable nor good. But some thinke this to bee true by ouer vehement practise in this act: for otherwise moderatly taken it is good and holesome, for the lightening and easing of the body, as is sayd before.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:8773:42"/>Question. <hi>Why is the seede of a man white, and the seede of a woman red?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> It is white in man, by reason of his great heate, and because it is digested better, and made white in the stones, the flesh of which is white, as the flesh of the pappes. But the seede of a woman is red, because it is the superfluitie of the second digestion, which is done in the liuer, which is red. Orels we may say, that it is because the flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers is corrupt vndigested bloud, and therefore it hath the colour of bloud.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Whether doth the seede of man come from the parts of the bodie, or from the humours?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> As some say, from the parts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die: and that we proue, because we see that a lame man dooth beget a lame child, and a father which hath a skarre, a child which hath a skarre, as <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi> reporteth, <hi>lib. de animal.</hi> which could not be if the seede did not fall from the parts of the body. But some say that it commeth from the humours, because it is made of the last nutriment, and the nutriment is no part but a humour But as for the lamenes &amp; skarre, that proceedeth from the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of the mother at the time of carnall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> sayth, 2. <hi>de generat animal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Wherefore doth the imagination of the mother, which imagineth of an A Ethiopian or Blackamoore, cause the mother to bring forth a black child: As Albertus Magnus reporteth of a Queene, who in the act of carnall copulation, imagined of a Blackamoore which was painted before her, and so brought foorth a Blackamoore?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer. Auicen</hi> sayth, that an imagination of a
<pb facs="tcp:8773:43"/>
fall, maketh a man fall, and the imagination of a leprosie maketh a man a leaper. And so in this purpose the imagination is aboue the forming po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, and so the child borne followeth the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not the power of forming and shaping, because it is weaker then the other.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Whether doth the seede of the man enter into the substance and matter of the child?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> The seede of the father and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth goe into the substance of the childe in the wombe: because that as creame doth goe into the substance of cheese, so the seede of man into the fruite in the wombe like vnto the creame, and the flowers of the woman doth enter in like vnto the milke. But this opinion doth not seeme to be of force. And therefore according vnto <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and other Philosophers, we say that the seed doth not goe into the substance of the childe: and it is proued thus, because that of the matter and the efficient cause should be all one, which is agaynst the Philosopher. The consequence is good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the seede is the efficient beginning of the child, as the builder is the efficient cause of the house, and therefore is not the materiall cause of the child. It is proued another way, because there is the selfe same materiall cause of nourishment and generation, 2. <hi>de anim.</hi> because wee haue our being and our nourishment of the same matter: but the seede cannot bee the materiall cause of nourishment, according vnto <hi>Auerrois,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not of being. But in trueth this it is, both the seedes are shut and kept in the wombe: but the seed of the man doth dispose and prepare the seed
<pb facs="tcp:8773:43"/>
of the woman to receiue the forme, perfection or soule, the which being done, it is conuerted into humiditie, and is fumed and breathed out by the pores of the matrix, which is manifest, because on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the flowers of the woman are the materiall cause of the young one.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why doth the matrix or wombe of a woman draw greedily the seede of man? for as Auer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rois doth say, there was a mayd in a bath, where some seede had been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>
                  <hi>Answer. Auerrois</hi> doth say, that the wombe and nature doe draw the seede, as the Lodestone doth yron, and the Agathe steele: but she dooth draw it for the perfection of her selfe.</p>

               <p>Question. <hi>Why haue not women them after fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie yeares of age?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Some answer, that old women be bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, and therefore they cease. But a better answer is, that then nature is weake in them, and therfore they cannot expell them, by reason of ouer much weakenes. And therefore there is great store of immundicities bred in them in one whole lumpe, &amp; they are by that meanes so infectious, that they infect men with their breath, and then the cough and other infirmities come vpon them. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore according vnto the counsel of the Phisitions, then men should abstaine from them.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why doe not such women corrupt and infect themselues?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because poyson doth not worke vpon it selfe, but vpon some other obiect: or els it dooth

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Because that them the flowers turne into milke, and into the nourishment of the child: for if a woman with childe haue them, it is a signe of miscarying with her child.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why doe they runne the first three moneths in women with child?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> By reason of the smalnes of the child, which cannot take all that matter and substance.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why haue not the female of brute beasts, as of sowle and fish, their flowers?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because as <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Albertus</hi> doe say, in beasts which go with feet, the flowers turne into haire, in fish into their skales, in birds into their feathers. And therefore in beasts you may note that the female is more hairy then the male, and the female of fishes fuller of skales, and the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male of birds fuller of feathers.</p>
               <p>Quest. <hi>Why doe the flowers receiue their name menstrua, of this word Mensis amoneth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because it is a space of time which doth measure the Moone, because the Moone doth end her course in 29. dayes and 14. houres. Now the Moone hath dominion ouer moyst things, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb facs="tcp:8773:45"/>
the flowers are an humiditie, they take their denomination of the moneth, and are called mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethly tearmes: for moyst things doe increase as the Moone doth increase, and decrease as she doth decrease.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why doe they runne longer time in some, the in other some, as in some sixe or seuen daies, and ordinarily in all three daies?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> The first are colder, and therfore they increase the more in them, and by a consequent they are the longer in expelling. And other wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are more hot, and therefore they haue the fewer, and are a shorter time in expelling them.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Where are the flowers kept before they runne?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Some say, in the matrix or wombe. But <hi>Auerrois</hi> dooth mistike this, and dooth say that the matrix is the place of generation, and that those flowers further generation nothing at all. And therefore he doth say, that there are certaine vaines about the backe bone which doe keepe them. And a signe of this is, because that those women at that time haue great griefe in their backe, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of expelling the flowers.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Whether are the flowers which are expelled, and the flowers which the child is ingendred of, all one?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> No, because the one are vncleane, &amp; vnfit for that purpose: but the other very pure &amp; cleane, and therefore that bloud is fit for generation.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why doe women which are gotten with child when they haue their flowers, bring foorth weake children, and leprous?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:8773:45"/>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Because those flowers are venemous, yea a woman in her flowers is most infectious. And so the cause dooth shine in the effect, as the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher dooth say, the effect dooth carry a likenes of the cause, and therefore such a childe is euilly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of bodie.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why haue not women their flowers all at one time of the moneth, but some in the newe Moone, some in the full, and some in the waine?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> By reason of their diuers complexions. And although all women in respect of men bee fleugmatike, yet of women among themselues, some are more sanguine then others, some more cholerike. And as euery moneth hath his quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, so they haue their complexions: the first is sanguine, the second cholerike. A woman which is of a sanguine complexion, hath her flowers in the first quarter, a cholerike in the second, a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly in the third, and so in the rest.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why haue such women as are of a sanguine coplexion, their flowers in the first quarter?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because that as <hi>Galen</hi> doth say, euery such thing added vnto such a thing, dooth make it more such, and therefore the first quarter of the Moone increasing bloud in a sanguine complexio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, therefore she doth then expell it.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why haue women their flowers so oft in the end of the moneth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because generally a women be fleug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matike, and the last quarter is fleume Orels this doth proceede of a defect, and therefore cold doth worke then to multiplie that matter, and the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter multiplied is then expelled.</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:8773:46"/>Question. <hi>Why haue women paine and griefe in the running of their flowers?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because it is like vnto the paine of the strangurie, that is, making of water drop by drop. For as the strangurie, by reason that the drinke is vndigested, doth offend the subtile passage of the vrine, as it doth happen after a bath, so the flowers which are an vndigested &amp; earthly substance, doe hurt the passage by which they goe.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why doth a woman easily conceaue after her flowers are runne from her?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because she is better prepared vnto conception, as being made cleane from her flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why doe women looke pale when they purge their flowers?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because then the heate goeth from al the outward parts of the bodie to the inward to helpe nature, and to expell the flowers, the which depriuation of heate, dooth cause a palenes in the face. Or els it is, because that fluxe is caused of raw humors, the which when they runne, do make the face colourles, and so by a consequence cause palenes.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why doth a woman which hath her flowers detest her meate?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because nature doth labour more to expell the flowers then to digest, and therefore if she should eate meate, that meate would remaine raw, which carefull nature doth not admit.</p>

                  <hi>Answer.</hi> According vnto the Phisitions, for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers reasons. The first is, because it proceedeth sometime of the man, that is, when he is of a cold nature, because then his seede is vnfit for genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The second, because his seede is somewhat waterish, and therfore doth not stay in the wombe. The third, because the seede of the man and the woman haue not the same proportion, as if the man be melancholy, and the woman sanguine: or if the man be cholerike, &amp; the woman very flaug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matike: because as it is euident in Philosophy, the agent and the patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ought to haue the same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, otherwise the action is hindred.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answer</hi> Because they haue a slipperie wombe, out of which the seede slippeth, and is not hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in. Or els because the mouth of their matrix is very straite, that the seede cannot enter in: or if it do goe in, it goeth in very slowly, so that the seed doth waxe colde in the meane time, and so is vnfit for generation, &amp; is resolued into a fleshy substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because that the seed receiued in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is extinguished and put out, as a little water cast into a great fire. And therefore we doe see that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men which doe vehemently desire the flesh, sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

conceaue with childe.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why are common women and whores neuer with child?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> By reason of diuers seede which doth corrupt and spill their instruments of conception: for it maketh them so slippery, that nature cannot retayne the seede. Or els it is because one seede dooth destroy another, and so neither is good for generation. And note out of <hi>Albertus,</hi> that the best remedie to helpe conception, is to take the matrix of a Hare beaten into powder, and purified in drinke, which worketh much to conception.</p>

               <p>Question. <hi>WHy dos some women conceaue a male child?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> If the seede doe fall into the rightside of the matrix or wombe, then a male-child is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, because that that side is hotter then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and heate dooth principally worke to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting of a male-child. And therefore as <hi>Albertus</hi> doth say, it the right side of the woman doth swell, it is a signe that she goeth with a male-childe. But some dot giue another reason, that is, when the seede of the father hath dominion ouer the seede of the woman, then a male-childe is bagotten: if the womans doe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because the seed is falne vnto the left side of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is coller then the right,
<pb facs="tcp:8773:47"/>
by reason of the spleene ioyning vnto it, which hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth colde. And as <hi>Albertus</hi> dooth say, when the woman after the act of copulation doth lye on the right side, it is a boye: when on the left, it is a wench: for the seede doth runne to that side on which the woman doth lye, and then such a childe is formed.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because it is the proper place of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and is placed in the middest of the woman. For as all the immundicities of a citie doe runne vnto the sinke, so all their monthly rearmes runne to the wombe or matrix.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why haue some women long and slon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der children, and some short and thicke?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because as <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Auerrois</hi> do say, the childe is formed according vnto the quantitie of the wombe. And therfore because some women haue a long &amp; a narrow wombe, their children be long and stender: and some contrariwise short and large, therefore their children be short and thick.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why dooth a woman sometimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue twinnes?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> According vnto <hi>Galen,</hi> because there are seuen cels or receptacles of seed in the womb, and therfore a woman may naturally haue so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny children at once, as there dooth seede fall into those cels: for there are three in the right side, and three in the left: in the right side boyes are ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and in the left wenches. And in the middest of those cels or chambers there is another, where old writers do say a Hermaphrodite is ingendred, that is, one who hath the secret parts of both sexes.
<pb facs="tcp:8773:48"/>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Because there are three principall cels in the wombe, one in the right side, another in the left, and the third in the middle, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the which whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the seed doth fall, a Hermaphro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite is said to be begotten in this manner: because nature doth alwayes tend vnto that which is best, therefore she dooth alwayes intende to beget the male, and not the female, because that the female is only for the males sake, and a monster in nature. Therefore the male is sometime begotten in all principall parts, and yet through the euill disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the wombe, and obiect, and inequalitie of the seed, when nature cannot perfect and end the male, she doth bring foorth the female, or Herma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrodite.

to bring foorth that which is most perfect and best: but in the end through the euil disposition of the matter, and influence of some speciall constel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, not being able to bring forth that which she entended, bringeth forth that which she can. As it did happen in <hi>Albertus</hi> time, where in a certaine village a cow brought foorth a calfe halfe a man: then the countrey men suspecting a shepheard, would haue burned him with the cow.

I aske how can this bee? It is answered thus: because the seede is cast vnto the cels or receptacles of the wombe, which seede was enough for two children, and then by chance it dooth sometime happen, that the skinne or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance betwixt the two cels or receptacles is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and they knit and ioyne in the back, and haue two heads.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answer. Aristotle</hi> sayto it proceedeth of super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluitie and abundance in matter: when there is too much matter, then he is borne with a great head, or sixe fingers: but if there be want of matter, then there is some part too little, or lesser then there ought to be.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> If the seede of the father doe fully o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome the seede of the mother, the child dooth wholly resemble the father. but if the mothers seed predominate, then he is like vnto the mother: but if he be like neither, that doth happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for many causes: sometimes through the foure first quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: sometime through the influence of some hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly constellation. <hi>Allertus</hi> giueth an example, and saith, that there was on a time a good constel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation for the begetting of hogges, and a man was then begotten and brought fooith which had a face like vnto a hooge. and according vnto this, diuers sorts of monsters are brought foorth.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> That proceedeth of the imagination of the mother, which thinketh of the disposition of
<pb facs="tcp:8773:50"/>
the father in the act of carnall copulation. And therefore by reason of the strong imagination in the time of conception, the children get the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the father. As it appeareth before of the Queene which had her imagination on a Blacka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moore: and of an AEthiopian Queene which brought foorth a white child, because her imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was vpon a white colour.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because the vertue and force of the grandfather is graffed in the hearts of the beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: and it may be said, that sometime it doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede of the similitude of the nouriture, and then the child is formed by the similitude of the grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> This proceedeth of the predomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of diuers elements, because that the bones are made of a terrestriall matter, and therefore are hard. But the braine and the marrow are made of a more waterie matter, and therefore are more soft: but the vitall spirits and animall spirits are ingendred of a more aerious substance, and these vitall spirits are principally in the liuer and the heart.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Because the childe is then fully perfect, or els it is because some benigne planet doth raigne, as Iupiter, who is a friend vnto nature: for accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto the Astronomers, he is hot and moyst, and therefore doth temper the malice and naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines of Saturne, which is cold and drie.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because the Moone is a colde planet which hath dominion ouer the child, and therfore dooth binde the childe with his coldnes, which is cause of his death.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because of the sudden chaunge from heate to cold, which cold doth hurt his tendernes. Another reason is, because the childs soft and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der bodie is wringed and put together, comming out at the narrowe and straite passage of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix. And especially the braine being moyst, and the head pressed and wringed together, is cause that some humours doe distill by the eyes, which are the cause of teares and weeping.

               <p>
                  <hi>Answer</hi> No, and the reason is, because he hath not the first digestion which is in the stomacke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he receiueth no meate by the mouth, but it commeth to him at the nauell: and therefore he maketh not water, but doth sweate, which vrine is

                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because that that vapour is burning, and dooth easily hurt the tender substance of the childe, entring in at the pores of the matrix or wombe. Yea, <hi>Albertus</hi> doth say, that if the childe

               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because the bodie of young women are fuller of pores, and more slender, and therfore the vapour of lightening dooth sooner enter into their bodie: but old women haue a thicke skinne, and wel compacted, and therefore the vapour can not enter in and cause this abortment.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because the flesh of the tongue is full of pores, and spungie, and receiueth great moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture in it, and more in drunken men then in so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. And therefore their tongue through often drinking, is full of naughtie humors, and by reason that it is so full, the instrument of taste is made thicke and grosse, because that taste is a vaine of the tongue, a subtile thin flesh being taken away.

And therefore if there be any long egges, it is a signe they haue great heate, and therefore they passe into the substance of the male: because that in euery kind of thing the male is hotter then the female, as the Philosopher doth say. If the egges be short and flat, it is a signe that the heat is small, and vndispersed, and therefore goeth into the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the female.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because there is in that place a mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of many sinewes, and because the meane wee touch by (which is the flesh) is more subtile there then in other parts, and therfore a better feeling. And this is true, if that place bee not touched too hardly: for if you doe so, then there is not that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light: and when a man is moderatly and softly touched there, the spirits which are there, are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed and runne into the face, and then from thence are cause of laughter.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why is wood burned conuerted into coale, and a bone burned into a white substance?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because the wood before it was bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned was reasonable moyst, and so after burning getteth heate accidentally, and that heate is not able to consume all the moysture of the wood, and therfore there remayneth some after the burning, and is conuerted into a blacke substance, because that the humiditie in the wood was slimie, &amp; could not bee altogether consumed by the fire. But a bone of his owne nature is colde and dry, hauing but small moysture in it, which the burning dooth wholly consume, and so accidentally the moysture
<pb facs="tcp:8773:55"/>
being consumed the bone waxeth white.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why doe some women loue white men, and some blacke?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> There are two answers: Some women haue a weake sight, and such delight in blacke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the white dooth hurt the sight more then blacke. The second reason is, because like doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the like: but because some women are of a hot nature, such are delighted with blacke, because blacknes doth follow heate. And some of them are of a cold nature, &amp; those are delighted with white, because cold is the mother of whitenes.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why doe liuing creatures sleepe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> For necessitie, because the instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of diuers actions are wearied, and by rest which is in sleepe, they are comforted, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> sayth.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why are students readie to sleepe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dinner, if they goe about to studie, and not if they solace themselues?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because that when a man doth applie his mind to studie, the naturall heate goeth from the outward parts of the bodie to the inward, and there is strengthened, because there commeth much together, and so causeth a fume to ascend from the meate to the head, which is the cause of sleep. Or els we may answer, that when the power or vertue with which wee liue is strongest, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall power is weakened. But when a man dooth solace himselfe by his pleasure, the naturall heate is spred abroad, and suffereth no vapour to ascend vnto the braine, and so he sleepeth not, but is kept from sleepe, by reason that the heate is disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:8773:55"/>Question. <hi>Why doe men willingly sleepe after labour?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Because that through continual mouing, the heate is dispersed to the externall parts of the bodie: the which after that the labour is past, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth together to the internall parts of digestio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, there to digest. And from digestion vapors doe rise from the heart to the braine, the which do stop the passages, by which the naturall heat should be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed to the externall parts: and then the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall parts being colde and thicke, by reason of the coldnes of the brain, sleep is procured. And by this it appeareth, that such as eat much &amp; drink much, doe sleeps much and long, because great store of humours &amp; vapors are bred in such, which cannot be digested and consumed of the naturall heate.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Why are such as sleepe much euill dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, and haue an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because that in sleep much moysture is gathered together, which cannot be consumed, which is expelled in waking: and so it doth couet to goe out through the superficiall parts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and especially it coueteth to the face, &amp; so is cause of a bad colourias it appeareth in such as are fleugmatike who desire more sleepe then others.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Because the fleume drawne vp to the iawes, doth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>Question. <hi>Why doe some dreame in their sleepe that they be in the water, and drowned, and some

that they be in the water and not drowned: and this doth happen especially in such as are fleugmatike?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> The reason is, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> sayth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the fleugmatike substance doth runne to the high parts of the bodie, and then they thinke that they are in the water and drowned, and when that substance draweth vnto the internall parts, then they thinke they escape. Another reason may be, ouer much repletion and drunkennes: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when a man is ouer much filled with meate, the fumes and vapors ascend and gather together, and therefore they thinke that they are drowned and strangled: but if they cannot ascend so high, then they seeme to escape.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>May any man procure a dreame by an externall cause?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer. Aristotle</hi> holdeth that it may be done. If a man doe speake softly at a mans eares, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake him, then of this stirring of the spirits, there are thundrings and buzzings in the head, and so a dreame of that. And so some men haue dreames by diuine reuelation, when it pleaseth God to send any.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Pleasant merry dreames doe followe the sanguine complexion: fearefull dreames the melancholy: the cholerike dreame of chiding, fighting, and fires and the fleugmatike of water.

               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Ouer great ioy doth ouer much coole the internall parts of the bodie, and ouer much griefe dooth drowne and suffocate the heate, the which fayling a man dyeth.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> The haire of the head doth proceede of the vapors which rise from the stomacke, and ascend to the head, and also of the superfluities which are in the braine: and these two passing
<pb facs="tcp:8773:57"/>
through the pores of the head, are conuerted into haire, by reason of the heate and drines of the head. And because mans bodie is full of humours, and hath more braine then other creatures, and also more superstuitie in the braine, which the braine expelleth, it followeth that he hath more haire then other lining creatures.</p>

                  <hi>Answer.</hi> The answer is, because that the sight hauing carried and represented vnto the minde that action, and iudging the same to be pleasant &amp; delightfull, and therefore desiring it, the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion draweth the likenes of it in conceit, and so stirreth vp the bodie to those gestures.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> When the stomacke hath nothing to consume, it consumeth the fleume or humours, which it findeth most readie and most at hand, and therefore wee suffer hunger better then thirst, because the heate hath nothing to be refreshed withall.</p>

               <p>Whether is it, as it seemeth vnto the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, because it is the last, &amp; that nothing els doth seeme good or bad vnto mortall men?

Or peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture dooth death seeme the most terriblest of all things, because they meant so to liue, that they thought to be immortall? or doth it strike a feare onely into them which liued a naughtie life? And vnto such as liued a vertuous life, death is not grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous, as the Poet sayth. Death is the end of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son obscure. Or be they grieued because they are seased on with a violent &amp; vntimely death? for such as dye when they come vnto olde age, doe for the most part dye without feare and griefe. For truely nature is, as a candle readie to be put out. And as <hi>Plato</hi> doth say: of all sorts of death, that which by nature doth come is most light, which happeneth rather with pleasure then dolour.</p>

               <p>There are double in euery one, continuall, or whole and broken. For the difference of diseases doe not proceede onely of the humours, but also of the places. A hot, thine and sharpe humour doth breede a sharpe, and a short, and a hot feuer: a cold and a thicke humour, a long and a dull one. So of wood, that which is hot and drie, as bayes, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue trees, cause a great flame, and are quickly bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: greene wet wood make a small smokie fire, and are long a burning.</p>

But if the place be narrowe and small, seeing it cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine all the humour, but by peecemeale, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot ripen all together, it will stirre vp a small feuer, but such a one as shall burne long. Put then the nature of the humour vnto the place, and so thou shalt finde all the differences of agues, which rise of the corruption of the humours. If yellow choler doe putrifie in great receptacles, as the vaines and arteries, seeing it is hot, it dooth kindle a most sharpe, hot, and short ague, which is called a burning, or heat. But if cold fleume do pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifie in the small vaines and arteries which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the flesh, it doth cause a long and a languish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ague, which they call a Cotidian.

               <p>What is the reason that the externall parts of the bodie of louers are sometimes cold, sometimes hot?</p>
               <p>Because that when they conceiue any griefe or dolour against their welbeloued, the naturall hear posteth away with the bloud into the internall parts of the bodie: whereof it commeth that the outwarde partes are colde, and for the same cause they become pale and sad. But when they receiue any good hope of their louer, or be greatly angry, then the heate with the bloud goeth to the skin, and becommeth hot and ruddie. And for the selfe same cause painters doe paint loue to be sometime sad and quiet, sometime fleeing and laughing, a very boy and child, because that lust is vehement, but dureth not long. The affection in lawfull friends is durable, as in fathers towards their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and wiues toward their husbands, but loue doth not last. And it happeneth oft among such as are vnknowne the one to the other. The other disposition and affection is firme and stable: &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate loue is vehement, and like vnto a mad man. They faine Loue to haue a firebrand, and wings, because that the mindes of louers are in suspense, and hang doubtfully and are vnconstant like birds: and then their heate burneth their heart with an vncessant, and veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t care of that which they loue. He holdeth a sword in his right hand, and in his left a quiuer with many arrowes,
<pb facs="tcp:8773:96"/>
because that in the beginning loue doth rise from one beame and glance of the eye: for he doth see and desire at the selfe same time. And as soone as he doth desire, the louer sendeth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall beames of the eie towards that which he loueth. And those beames are like vnto arrowes, because the louer doth dart them into the bodie. There are arrowes in the quiuer, because that those which loue, send forth secret beames and glances of the eies. As the wind doth kindle the fire, so custome dooth kindle loue: for properly loue doth not rise of custome. For if it were so, then of necessitie custome should alwayes breede loue: but the beginning of loue is sudden. He is naked, because that that desire hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth without any meane. For no man loueth by by another, nor priuily, nor whom he knoweth not. And therefore caruers doe sometime carue kings and gods naked for honours sake, thereby to shewe that they haue no hidden vice lurking in their breasts, but that their thoughts are open and sincere. Loue is not one but many, either because there are diuers louers of things, (for they loue not alike: and <hi>Plato</hi> sayth, that loue is a beast with many heads) or els, because as the same <hi>Plato</hi> saith, the same loue falleth vnder many loues. Loue hath Venus for his mother, that is, sensuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and lust: and by the image of Venus they faine vnlawfull desire. Loue is sayd to haue been in loue with Erinnys a furie of hell, because that many haue loued wickedly, and haue been thrall to wicked affections: as I haue declared in my se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond booke of Allegories, which I haue made of those fained stories.</p>

For if a man haue a body full of euil humours, him the ayre which is corrupted doth enter into, and corrupteth that little good humour which is left in him: and so all their humours being corrupted, they must needs perish. But if a man haue not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny superstuities, &amp; doth abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with good humors, he is either not at all, or not much offended with the plague. That the disposition of the bodie is the cause of this effect, it doth appeare by the example of externall things. The oake is not easily subiect vnto alteration, not dooth not easily set on fire. Reedes and rushes are much more apt to receiue fire: and straw more then they.

For he in whom there was much fleume, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dispersed, doth moysten the head, and then he is in a sleepe: but such as haue a drie head are kept more awake, because they are made more drie.</p>

               <p>Because that it is throughly affected and altred, by reason of the coldnes of the ayre which dooth compasse it. And therefore when we powre in very hot water on a sudden, and not heate the glasse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the heate doth fight and striue with the cold which was in it: the colde with the ayre presently fleeing, causeth the breaking of the glasse. It must be granted, that there be certaine small holes and passages in the glasse, which doe hold and receiue the purest and thinnest parts of the aire, the which although we doe not see with our eyes, and with sence, yet wee cannot deny but by nature there they be. Others doe say, that because the glasse is very cold, then it is very dry also, &amp; therfore that which is the subtilest part in it, whether it be a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour or the ayre, is thrust out, and doth as it were
<pb facs="tcp:8773:104"/>
vanish away, and so is made apt to breake. And so it is in very dry wood. And so <hi>Hippocrates</hi> did say, that the vaines were broken with cold. That ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which is very hot, finding the glasse to bee such, drying it more and more, doth cause him to breake. If it had been before wet ouer, and heated a little, it would not haue been hurt: as wee see wrastlers annoynted before they goe to wrastle. For when drines falleth into those passages and inuisible holes, it fleeth quickly with the ayre, and the softnes of the glasse giuing place vnto the heate, doth not easily breake. It is easily seene that grasse hath those passages, by earthen pottes, into which if you powre water, and dawbe them with pitch, yet the humour will woose out. You may also see in winter time a smoake or fume breake out of a glasse, when you cast water into him.</p>

               <p>By reason of their softnes, yeelding vnto the earth, they doe dissolue his hardnes, that it can worke no further.

In the anger of lions and buls, nature dooth consent vnto the minde, and doth inforce it to be greatly moued, as men doe sometimes when they bee angrie, beate their hands or other part.
