                  <note>In 4 parts. Parts 1 and 2, by Bruno Ryves, were originally issued at Oxford as 21 separate newsbooks between 20 May 1643 and 16 March 1644. Part 2, "Mercurius rusticus: or, The countries complaint, of the sacriledges, prophanations, and plundrings, committed by the schismatiques, on the cathedrall churches of this kingdome" has separate title page with imprint "Oxford, printed in the yeare, 1646"; pagination and register are continuouswith part 1. Parts 3 and 4, "Querela Cantabrigiensis" and "Micro-chronicon" each have separate dated title page, pagination, and register. The former is attributed to John Barwick, and the latter to Bruno Ryves. "Querela Cantabrigiensis" was also probably issued separately (Wing B1010), as was "Micro-chronicon" (Wing R2451).</note>

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <head>The Preface.</head>
                  <p>WHen the ſinnes of this Kingdome were ripe for puniſhment, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Juſtice permitted a great part of it to be beſotted with Diſcontents, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wholly cauſeleſſe, or ſuch as His Maj. was pleaſed to remeay with Grants ſo unmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurably gracious, as could not otherwiſe be juſtified, then by thier importunity that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them, and His Majeſties Royall ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe of his Subjects peace and ſafety.</p>
                  <p>Theſe grants were ſo far from ſatisfying thoſe whoſe broken fortunes and boundleſſe deſires would not permit them to live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Civill War, that they made of them no other uſe, then thereby to ſtrenthen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to demand more: till at laſt they broke out into moſt unnaturall <hi>Rebellion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The people alwayes apt to cheriſh murmures and invectives againſt thier Princes, and now grown wanton with the fruits of a long peace, incline to <hi>Abners</hi> mind, and thinke the Warre (which yet they knew not) but a
<pb facs="tcp:154341:5"/>
ſport. Therefore with a great facility they embrace the deſigne: and the baits to cover the Hooks with, are <hi>the preſervation of Religion,</hi> and <hi>the vindication of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> And howſoever they cannot reconcile their practiſe with Gods command, which under <hi>paine of damnation forbids all Subjects to reſiſt their King</hi>: yet they are ſo wedded to that intereſt which they Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge in <hi>Religion,</hi> and Liberty, that for Gods command, if they cannot untie the knot, they reſolve to cut it. Doe but aſſure them that the forbidden fruit will make them as Gods, and they will eate it though it be forbidden: doe but perſwade them that to take up armes againſt their Soveraigne is the way to ſecure their <hi>Religion</hi> and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and they make bold with God for once to chooſe their owne way for ſo good an end.</p>
                  <p>From ſo deſperate Reſolution, had they had but Morall juſtice, they might have beene kept back by the improbability of thoſe calumnies whereby His Majeſtie was tradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, as intending to alter <hi>Religion</hi> and infringe their Liberties.</p>
                  <p>Or had <hi>Religion</hi> (to which they doe ſo
<pb facs="tcp:154341:5"/>
Zealouſly pretend) had that potent influence upon them, it might have taught them, <hi>that Religion cannot be defended by tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing Gods commands, which are the Rule of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if nothing elſe, yet even regard to their owne pretenſions, the defence of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> and Liberty, ſhould have wrought in them a deteſtation of <hi>Rebellion,</hi> which is ſo contrary to both.</p>
                  <p>For as an eye had to Gods dominion over us ſhould exact obedience to his commands, though never ſo much to our prejudice: So the meditation of his infinite goodneſſe ought to win it from us, becauſe his commands en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyne us onely what is for our good, if we could ſee it.</p>
                  <p>He would not have forbidden Subjects to defend <hi>Religion</hi> againſt their King by force of Armes, but that he knew as Rebells can be no friends to Religion, ſo it gaines love &amp; admiration by the innocent patience of thoſe that profeſſe it; where as <hi>Blood-ſhed, Force,</hi> and <hi>Rapine,</hi> the fruits of <hi>Rebellion</hi>) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure <hi>Hatred</hi> or <hi>Hypocriſie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And for <hi>Liberty,</hi> it is for he good of
<pb facs="tcp:154341:6"/>
Mankind, to forbid the aſſertion of it by Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects Armes taken up againſt their Prince: both becauſe that pretence would otherwiſe be uſed by thoſe that have a deſigne to make the abuſed people their owne ſlaves, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Rebellion doth more violate the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects liberty, then is morally poſsible for the worſt Prince in times of peace to doe.</p>
                  <p>This truth was knowne before by specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a few, whoſe endeavours to infuſe it into the diſtempered peoples minds, had the fate of <hi>Caffandraes</hi> predictions, <hi>to hit the truth and want belief,</hi> till theſe ſad times have at laſt verified it by acoſtly experience.</p>
                  <p>That this may be more univerſally benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall; you have too plentifull a harveſt of Inſtances collected in the enſuing Relations: wherein may evidently be ſeene, that this War which the multitude was ſo fond of, as the onely meanes to preſerve <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Liberty,</hi> hath beene the utter ruine of them both.</p>
                  <p>Here you ſhall find theſe great pretenders to <hi>Religion,</hi> Suppreſsing that which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves confeſſe to be Divine Truth, Debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring poore priſoners the comfort of joyning

At length having conſulted with Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Cole,</hi> they carry him to the common Gaole, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Gaoler to put him in the ſtrong hold, (a place provided for the moſt deſperate Malefactors) affirming they would ſoone returne to take further order with him. There he remained till one a clock, being then removed to another chamber. They now return to their fellows who were ſearching Sir <hi>Iohn Lucas's</hi> house, ſome twentie of them ruſht into the Ladies Chamber, laid hands upon her, ſet a ſword to her breaſt, requiring her to tell where the Armes and Cavaliers were.

Two Gentlewomen(one of which had long been ſick) by flight eſcaped their fury, but their moſt wel-wiſhing neighbours dared not to be knowne to receive them into their houſe, the people threatning to burne that houſe that gave them entertainment. Having ſecured the Maſter, they now begin to Plunder the houſe, all is prize that comes to hand, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A few houres diſ-robe the houſe of that rich furniture that had adorned it many years. The Major &amp; Aldermen ſtanding by all this while, but either not able or not willing to conjure downe the devil which themſelves had raiſed up. All the ſervants they could meet with they bring to priſon, they laid hands on <hi>I. Brown</hi>(one who had bin a ſervant to the family from the time of Sir <hi>Iohn Lucas's</hi> Grandfather) they bind him to a tree, ſet a Musket to his breaſt, &amp; a ſword to his throat, and tye lighted matches between his fingers, and <hi>Io. Furley</hi> (a yong pragmaticall boy) examins him concerning his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Intentions, Horſes, Money, &amp;c, but eſpecially concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning M.<hi>Newcomin,</hi> whether he had not given an Oath of ſecrecy:

Whether he were not to ride a great Horſe? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he were not habited in a Buffe jerkin &amp; velvet coat? &amp;c. Feare eaſily prompts the old man to anſwer what he thought would give content. Out of his Examination the Major frams an Information againſt Sir <hi>John</hi> &amp; M <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comin,</hi> not forgetting to relate the good ſervice he had done, the Horſe and Armes he had taken, but withall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying, how miſerably the houſe was plundered by the zealous people, adding in his Letters (&amp; that very true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) That he could doe no more then a child among them, with theſe Letters he preſently diſpatcheth a Poſt to the Houſe of Commons.</p>
                     <p>About one a clocke a new Alarm is raiſed, that 200 ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Horſemen are diſcovered in a vault at Sir <hi>J. Lucas's,</hi> That they had killed nine men already, and were iſſuing forth to deſtroy the Towne. The ſhops are ſhut up in an inſtant, and the multitude throng downe thither to take or kill theſe Cavaliers. And becauſe they find none there, they now ſpend their rage upon the houſe, they batter down the doores &amp; wals, beat down the windows, teare his Evidences, deface his Walks and Gardens, doe any thing that may doe miſchiefe. From thence they go to his Park, pull down his Pales, kill his Deere, drive away his Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell. And to ſhew that their rage will know no bounds, &amp; that nothing is ſo ſacred or venerable which they dare not to violate, they breake into Saint <hi>Giles</hi> his Church, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the Vault where his Anceſtours were buried, and with Piſtols, Swords, and Halberts, transfixe the Coffins of the dead.</p>
                     <p>And now the Majors care begins to ſhew it ſelfe, he ſets a Guard upon the houſe that no hurt ſhould be done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, yet that Guard ſuffered 100 l. worth of corn, (which at firſt was neglected as contemptible luggage) to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out, and the moſt of it to their owne houſes. Another guard he ſets upon the Priſon, left the Priſoners ſhould be aſſaulted by the people who were ſo much incenſed againſt them,

though it had bin ſit to ſet ſome honeſt men to guard them from thoſe guardians, who were as forward as the people to drinke their blood.</p>
                     <p>On Thurſday comes down Sir <hi>Thomas Barrington</hi> and M.<hi>Grimſton,</hi> as a Committee from the Houſe, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into the market place before the Priſon-doore (the Town-Hall not able to receive the leaſt part of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude) there published two Orders from the Houſe, one wherein Sir <hi>John Lucas</hi> and his adherents were proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed guilty of high Treaſon for intending to aſſiſt the King. Another, wherein thankes were given the people for the good ſervice they had done, yet they were told withall, that their act of Plundering was againſt the ſenſe of the Houſe. Some of the agents in that work, produced a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Order of Parliament (not heard of before among ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest men) by which they juſtified what they had done; Sir <hi>Thomas Barrington</hi> replyed that it was a falſe and faigned Order, contrived by the malignant party to render the Houſe odious, and very lovingly beſought the people to do ſo no more.

aſſured them that there ſhould bee no reſiſtance made: and withall told them, that his Maſter was at the Wells, but had leſt order to give them the beſt wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the houſe could afford, and upon notice given would be ready (if they had ſuch Order) to render him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe up to the Houſe of Commons, whoſe Priſoner hee acknowledged himſelfe to be: and withall offered that if they would have patience but while hee went to the back doore, the Houſe ſhould open unto them. This ſo reaſonable an anſwer could not ſatisfie unreaſonable men, who it ſeemes were reſolved to force the doore, rather then have it opened, to give a peaceable admittance: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they revile the Groome, call him Rogue, and threaten to kill him, not becauſe he would not, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he could not give them entrance. And to make good their threats, <hi>Sandes</hi> and <hi>Seaton</hi> commanded ſome of their Rout to hold him up againſt his Maſters Hall doore, and bade ſome twelve or more Dragooners to give fire on him, which was done accordingly: on the word given, they that held him withdrew, not truſting to the undiſtinguiſhing bullet, and preſently the Groome fell downe, by which meanes hee eſcaped the fury of the ſhot, which tooke effect onely on the doore, and beat it downe. The entrance that was offered, thus forced, the houſe is inſtantly filled by the Commanders, the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, their abettors, and the Souldiers.

Being brought into the Bed-chamber, <hi>Sandes</hi> demands whether there were

At laſt being come to the Dining Chamber, Colonel <hi>Sandes</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes a dozen of Candles to be lighted, and ſo to be held to and under the Stewards hands, and lighted Match to be applyed betweene his fingers, for the ſpace of a quarter of an houre, <hi>Sandes</hi> himſelfe all the while looking on, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded both Candle and Match to be renewed, as often as either went out, or burnt dull. In this Torment they continued the poore ſoule, untill both his hands were ſhamefully burnt, not being able to relieve himſelfe by that diſcovery for which they tortured him. Nor was their barbarous cruelty thus practiſed on the Steward on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, from him they deſcend to the reſt of the ſervants, whom they prick with their ſwords, beat with their Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>axes to the indangering their lives, and all this to extort a Confeſſion where their Maſters Money and Plate were: but when this inhumanitie produced not the effect they looked for, they broke up every doore, plundred every Trunk and Cheſt, and examined every darke place from the Cloſet and Cabinet to the Powdring-Tub and Oven. Nay, the Cellar eſcaped not their fury; What they could not drinke, either Wine or Beere, they let out and poured upon the ground. In this ſearch they found and carryed away five hundred pounds in money, and ſome ſtore of Armes.

that it was a Truth and a Divine Truth, yet not fit to be preached at all times, no not by thoſe that were intruſted with it by God himſelfe, no though it might be in ſome danger of Impeachment.

But behold what it is to be voted a delinquent, or a Scandalous Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster by the Committee; it is to be put out of the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Law, and expoſed to the fury of the people: for on his returne Oath is made before a Juſtice of Peace, that at <hi>Halſtead</hi> in <hi>Eſſex</hi> it was concluded that an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men from <hi>Cogſhall</hi> and <hi>Colcheſter</hi> ſide (ſome of that Crew that plundered Sir <hi>John Lucas</hi> his houſe) ſhould ſuddenly ſurprize M. <hi>Simmons</hi> in his houſe, Plunder his goods, and cut off his perſon as one not fit to live, becauſe he was (as they ſaid) againſt the Parliament: But by the good providence of God this conſpiracy was diſcovered and prevented.</p>

and begin the Battery, and continue it from the Wedneſday to the Monday following, never giving any intermiſſion to the beſieged, who were but 25 fighting men to make good the place againſt an Army of 1300. In this time they ſprung two Mines, the firſt in a vault through which Beer and Wood and other neceſſaries were brought into the Caſtle: this did not much hurt, it being without the foundation of the Caſtle. The ſecond was conveyed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſmall Vaults, which by reaſon of the intercourſe betweene the ſeverall paſſages to every office, and almoſt every roome in the Caſtle, did much ſhake and indanger the whole fabrick. The Rebels had often rendred ſome unreaſonable conditions to the beſieged to ſurrender, as to give the Ladies, both the Mother &amp; the Daughter in Law, and the women and children quarter, but not the men, the Ladies both infinitely ſcorning to ſacrifice the lives of their Friends and Servants to redeem their own from the crueltie of the Rebells, who had no other crime of which they could count them guilty, but their fidelity and earneſt endeavours to preſerve them from violence and robbery, chooſe bravely (according to the Nobleneſſe of thoſe Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Families from which they are both extracted) ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to dye together then live on ſo diſhonourable terms.

And though in their <hi>Diurnals</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> they have told the world that they offered threeſcore thouſand pounds to redeem themſelves &amp; the Caſtle, and that it was refuſed, yet few men take themſelves to be bound anything the more to beleeve it, becauſe they report it.

After the Doctor had remained Priſoner five or ſix dayes, and having recovered ſo much ſtrength as to hold out another worrying, he was, (with an ill intention in ſome) brought before the Councel of Warre, where up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Doctors complaint of the hard uſage he had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone, ſome of the prime Gentry being aſhamed of the cruelties acted on him, being a Meſſenger, and in that regard by the Law at Arms ought to be priviledged from all affronts, much more from ſuch violent out-rages, Sir <hi>John Northcoote</hi> indeavoured to palliate the buſineſſe, and to take off from the odiouſneſſe of it, by alleagding the Contents of the Letters, which indeed being for ſome preparatories and overtures of Peace, might inrage theſe men that were Enemies unto it: To which the Doctor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, that under favour, that could be no ground nor yet excuſe for their ſavage uſage of him; becauſe they had beaten him, and almoſt murthered him in the Earle of <hi>Stamfords</hi> preſence, before they knew the Contents of the Letters, or read ſo much as one ſyllable of them, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed received them, the violent Serjeant Major ſeizing on him before he could deliver them: This ſo unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable a returne, put the Knight to his Italian ſhrug, and

                     <p>On Monday the 29 of <hi>May</hi> 1643, a boy of five or ſix years of age, attended by a youth, was comming to <hi>Oxford</hi> to his father an officer in the Kings Army, paſſing through <hi>Buckinghamſhire,</hi> he fell into the hands of ſome Troopers of Colonel <hi>Goodwins</hi> Regiment, who not onely Pillaged him of the cloathes which he brought with him, but tooke his doublet off his back, and would have taken away his hat and boots, if the youth that attended on him had not very earneſtly interceded for them to ſave them. For one of the company, more tender hearted then the reſt, moved with the childs cryes &amp; affrightment, and with the youths earneſt intreatie, prevailed with the reſt not to rob the child of theſe neceſſary fences from the injury of wind and weather.

While ſome of theſe Rebells were executing this Crueltie on his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, others goe up into his Study and Chambers, and take away all that was of good value, and portable.

No, Captain <hi>Buck</hi> knew that it would not be lawfull alwayes to commit murther, and rob thoſe that are quiet in the Land, and therefore reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to make uſe of the preſent opportunity: he was not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant that the wages of a faithfull ſervant to the Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was <hi>full licence to doe any thing that can ſatisfie Luſt, private Revenge or Avarice</hi>: And therefore in <hi>July</hi> laſt, <hi>Buck</hi> himſelfe, not like a Captaine of Souldiers, but a Ring-leader to a <hi>Rout of Rogues,</hi> came to Maſter <hi>Fowlers</hi> houſe at <hi>Minchin-Hampton,</hi> and moſt theeviſhly broke open the Window of his Sonnes Study, and ſo entred the houſe: In the Study they found rich Treaſure which they did not know, being indeed without a Metaphor <hi>Pearl be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Swines,</hi> for young M. <hi>Fowler,</hi> a Practicioner it ſeemes in Phyſick, had in his Study <hi>Extract of Pearle, Aurum Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabilc, Confections of Amber,</hi> a great quantity of <hi>Compound</hi> waters, a good proportion of <hi>Pearle in Boxes,</hi> a Box full of <hi>Bezoar Stone,</hi> with many other things of admirable uſe, for the preſervation of the life of man, and of very great value, all which they took and brake in pieces, and tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling them under foot, made them utterly unuſeful either for themſelves or others.

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:154341:90"/>
that uſe and value, <hi>Buck</hi> (a rude untutored man as he is) called her Whore, and with his Pole-axe gave her a blow on the neck, and ſtruck her downe, and being riſen again, again he ſtrikes her downe with his Pole-axe, nay, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the glorious victory, he ſtrikes her down a third time, and had ſhe bin able to riſe from the floore, queſtionleſſe, had ſtruck her down a fourth time.

But as ſoon as Miſtreſſe <hi>Fowler</hi> came with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his reach, without regard either to her Age, or Sex, he caught her by the Throat, knocked her downe, and being downe, kicked her, and trampled on her with his feet.

                     <p>The Reaſons which prevailed with them, to make this tender unto His Majeſtie, were many, we may reduce them to three heads.</p>

                     <p>The ſecond Inducement was the frequent affronts gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to His Majeſtie by the Rebells, to the great regret of every good Subject : and of theſe they give many Inſtances.</p>

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:154341:100"/>
for being Proclaimed on Friday the third of <hi>March,</hi> the next day (<hi>Saturday</hi>) being the chiefe Market day, when the Market was fulleſt, that the newes might be carryed into all parts of the Country, and every one learne from ſo deſperate an example to contemne their Soveraignes Commands : <hi>Fines</hi> comes in his Coach to the high Croſſe, attended by a Troope of Horſe, and after a Declaration read, That the Proclamation publiſhed the day before was a Scandalous and Libellous Paper, and ſuch as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to be burnt by the hand of a publique Hangman ; he cauſed the Serjeant that Ploclaimed it to burne it, holding Piſtolls to his breſt, and threatning to ſhoot him if he did not hold them high enough, fearing it ſeemes that ſo damnable, ſo unpardonable a Treaſon ſhould want witneſſes.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, As the direct end of their deſire to deliver up the Citie to the Kings protection, was conſcience of dutie to God and their Soveraigne, ſo the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected end was their owne ſecuritie, and quitting themſelves of thoſe Oppreſſions and Grievances un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which they ſuffered ; And theſe were many.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The often repeated Taxations and Loanes of Money unto the King and Parliament, as they were pleaſed to joyne them upon the thred-bare ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the <hi>Puplique Faith,</hi> and if any man refuſed to lend on that credit which they had banckrupted long before, he was threatned with Impriſonment, Plundring, or which was worſe then both, ſending up to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament : And to theſe may be added, the dayly drayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their purſes by illegall exactions imployed for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payring the Caſtle, building of Forts, and maintaining a Garriſon againſt the King.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, By urging upon them new and Treaſonable Votes and Proteſtations : If not fully in words, yet in the the uſe and interpretation of them directly oppoſite to

the Oath of Allegiance, the Oath of the Citie taken by every Citizen when he is elected into the place of a Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſe, in which they ſweare in the ſixth Article of that Oath, not to enter into any Oath or Confederacy againſt the king, contrary to the Lawes of the Land: and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe contrary to the Proteſtation recommended from the Parliament to the Subjects of this Kingdome: The Oath (for the tenor of words) was this following.</p>

B. doe proteſt and vow, in the preſence of Almightie <hi>God,</hi> that I will to the utmeſt of my power, and to the hazard my t ſe and fortunes, oppoſe all ſuch Forces as ſhall attempt any thing againſt the Citie of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> Without the conſent of the King and Parliament ſo to doe.</p>
                     <p>In which Proteſtation, they tooke the name of the King in vaine, for when they ſay (<hi>King and Parliament</hi>) they meant the <hi>two Houſes</hi> without the <hi>King,</hi> for if actions bee the beſt interpreters of the Agents words, it is more then manifeſt, that by the Proteſtation they inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ingage that Citie in Rebellion againſt the King, and that under the tye of Religion. And for proofe, I offer firſt their ſeconding this Proteſtation with another which ſpake more plainly, wherein they were to proteſt with their lives and fortunes to reſiſt Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> the Lord Generall the Earle of <hi>Forth,</hi> the Lord Marqueſſe <hi>Hertford</hi>; the Earle of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton</hi> and their Forces: and ſecondly, becauſe as before the tendring of this Proteſtation, they had received Colonel <hi>Eſſex</hi> to Command there for the Parliament; ſo within 2 few dayes after the firſt Proteſtation was tendered, they admitted Colonel <hi>Popham</hi> and Sir <hi>Edward Hungerford,</hi> with their Regiments, and afterward Colonel <hi>Fines</hi> without any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitiog, that ſo now being backed with ſo ſtrong a power, they might make the latter Proteſtation the interpreter of the former Upon the Petition of Miſtreſſe <hi>Majoreſſe,</hi> the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:154341:101"/>
Lady <hi>Rogers,</hi> Miſtreſſe <hi>Holſworth,</hi> Mireſſe <hi>Vicaris,</hi> with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Zealous Siſters, to the number of a hundred.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, By difarming all ſuch as were any wayes ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to beare a good and loyall affection to His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtic, unleſſe they would take ſuch Proteſtations as ſhould be tendered to them, and having taken away ſuch Armes as they found. (not ſatisfied with this) they urge on them another Proteſtation, proteſting in the ſight of God, and calling him to witneſſe, that they had no other Armes concealed in their houſes, either their owne or ohers: and if any man refuſed to take this Proteſtation, he was inſtantly impriſomed as an enemy to the State, and a man not to be confided in.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The perpetuall ſcorn and obloquy to which they were expoſed, reproached every day as they paſſed the ſtreets, with names of Malignants, and Papiſts; nay, as if they had beene worſe then Jewes, they ſpit at them, and threaten to take a ſpeedy courſe with them.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, The generall contempt and prophanation of Gods holy Worſhip and Service, rending of Surplices, tearing the Booke of Common Prayer, breaking downe Organs, exterminating the whole Liturgy out of their Congregations, and all theſe Out-rages, not only wink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at, but countenanced and incouraged by <hi>Fixes</hi> and his fellow Rebells; and that they might have <hi>Like People, Like Prieſt,</hi> They diſcountenance or drive away the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Miniſters, and ſubſtitute in their places the moſt infamous notorious Schiſmaticks that they can pick out of ſeverall Counties, as <hi>Tumb's</hi> of <hi>Limſter</hi> in <hi>All-Saints,</hi> in Maſter <hi>Williamsſons</hi> Cure an Orthodox and godly man; <hi>Craddocke Bacon, Walter, Simonds,</hi> and one <hi>Matthew Hazard,</hi> whom though f name laſt, yet deſerves to have the precedency of all the reſt, as being a maine Incendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:154341:102"/>
Religion as it is eſtabliſhed, and made them even to abhorre the ſervice of the Lord.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, becauſe upon the poynt they were confined to <hi>Briſtol,</hi> not daring to goe out of the Citie, for in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where the Commands and Ordinances of the two Houſes prevailed, they had given a Liſt of the names of the Malignants that durſt appeare for the King, to the end, that if any of them, came thither they might be apprehended and ſent Priſoners to <hi>Taunton, Barkley</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, or ſome other Priſons; or as Delinquents ſent to the Parliament.</p>
                     <p>It was no wonder therefore, that a Citie thus robb'd of its wealth and libertie, groaning under an unſupportable yoke of bondage and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>'Tis therefore cenfeſſed on all hands, That Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Yeomans,</hi> Maſter <hi>Bowcher,</hi> and others, had an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to caſt out the Rebells, and to deliver <hi>Briſtol</hi> into the Kings poſſeſſion, reſolving to ſecure the perſon of the Governour and ſome others of the chiefeſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells, but not to kill them: To this purpoſe, a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion is obtained and ſent to Maſter <hi>Robert Yeomans</hi> to rayſe Forces, and conſtitute Commanders for the Kings ſervice.

This Church was firſt differenced by the name of Saint <hi>Amphibalus,</hi> who received a Crowne of Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome under the perſecution of <hi>Diocleſian</hi>: Next it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed this name for that of <hi>S.

                     <p>The Rebells under the Conduct of Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> fate downe before the Citie of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> on Tueſday the <hi>12 of December, 1642.</hi> about twelve of the clock, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the City that afternoon between two and three:being Maſters of the City, they inſtantly fall upon the Cloſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a pretence to learch for Cavaliers.
