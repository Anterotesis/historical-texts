         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

EAR-MARK
OF
Mr. WILLIAM PRINNE.</head>
            <p>'<seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Was once a ſaying of the famous <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that
for a man to be afflicted, it was <hi>Humanum;</hi> to
be derided, 'twas <hi>Turpiſſimum:</hi> And upon
that good Rule Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> had ſpared me the
labour of a ſtudied deriſion if he had once ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himſelf <hi>ingenuous</hi> in any thing ſave the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion</hi>
of his own ſhame, which truly he has plentifully done very
lately in a great number of peeviſh &amp; moſt unadviſed Pamphlets.
A <hi>Man,</hi> (one wou'd think) that might have learn'd the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of ſeditious Scribling, long e're this time, if his guilt had
taken half ſo deep an <hi>Impreſſion</hi> upon his <hi>heart,</hi> as his puniſhment
hath left on his <hi>Head:</hi> But his violent humour is now (as it
ſeems) grown incorrigible; he proclaims open hoſtility againſt
all this ſide of the terreſtrial <hi>Globe,</hi> and appeares like an inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
of the <hi>Antipodes</hi> point blank againſt all men.</p>
            <p>Ther's a Martial Law amongſt School-boyes, that after the
firſt blow given by one of the Combatants, the other may fall
on, and defend himſelf though his ſtanding on his own guard coſt
his adverſary a Bloudy Noſe, or a Black Eye. This Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
is the firſt that hath bidden defiance to us all, and himſelf
too; his high ſpirit and animoſitie has incouraged him to make
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:119065:3"/>
the firſt Onſet; and what quarter can he expect from either
Enemy or Friend, who aſperſes both, and tells them to their
faces he ſcorns them? Certainly, mighty is the Mans Courage,
who dares attempt theſe things; great his proweſſe; invincible
his valour; to give you one proof of his Magnanimity for all;
do but reflect upon, and well conſider the grand <hi>Action,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Paſſion</hi> of His life, and tell me who more daring, more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
more venturous than He, who in the twinkling of an Eye,
<hi>Praeſto,</hi> while a man could ſay <hi>What's this? run his head thorow
an Inch-thick board.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Often have I made it matter of admiration, when I have ſeen
an abuſive Copy of Verſes (that hath been but the product of a
<hi>green brain)</hi> of a Malapert Youngſter againſt his Schoolmaſter,
in revenge of that ſeverity which his own folly juſtly merited:
My wonder has been more increaſt, when I have read a Libel
penn'd againſt a Country Iuſtice of the Peace, by an oppreſs'd
or ſportive Gentleman: but for a <hi>Man, an old Man, a Lawyer,
Bencher of Lincolns Inne,</hi> about the period of his days to raile
at all <hi>Authority,</hi> all kinds of Government, to make himſelf dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrically
oppoſite to whatſoever is called the <hi>Preſent power,</hi>
in good earneſt I think there are more wonde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>rers at it than my
ſingle ſelf. Againſt <hi>Kings,</hi> againſt <hi>Liturgy,</hi> againſt <hi>Biſhops,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
thoſe that are againſt <hi>Kings, Liturgy,</hi> and <hi>Biſhops; pro</hi>
and <hi>con, con</hi> and <hi>pro, for,</hi> and <hi>againſt.</hi> I lately perus'd a Paper,
the title whereof was this, <hi>The names of the Lords of the Other
Houſe:</hi> having read it over, and over again, I was ſomewhat
troubled at his late Highneſſe's overſight or forgetfulneſſe, in
leaving out this Gentleman's name, for (without all peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
<hi>[THE LORD PRYNNE]</hi> would have ſounded very
emphatically, and <hi>He</hi> would have quitted himſelf in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of that function very worthily, which conſiſts (as I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd)
altogether <hi>in exerciſing a Negative voice over all the
good People of this Nation,</hi> which I'me ſure he would have done
from the <hi>higheſt</hi> to the <hi>loweſt. Negatives</hi> are indeed a good
<hi>Periphraſis</hi> for the Deity; yet very dangerous (as I conceive)
for any <hi>man</hi> to a pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rine to himſelf or make a Monopoly on
eſpecially a <hi>Man</hi> that never was a <hi>Lord</hi> in this world, nor ever
is like to be one.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:119065:3"/>
This is the <hi>Man,</hi> the <hi>error</hi> of whoſe Judgement, and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable
<hi>inſtability</hi> is to be imputed to the loſſe of his two <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſes;</hi>
for if a <hi>Bowle's</hi> deviation from the <hi>Jack</hi> is occaſioned here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
much more a rational Creature's <hi>à fortiori.</hi> This is the <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam,</hi>
whoſe paſſion is the <hi>Conquerour</hi> (as <hi>Cleaveland</hi> ſayes in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
caſe.) <hi>This</hi> is the eminent Wit of all <hi>London,</hi> abating one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
one Creek, which they call <hi>Billingſgate; there</hi> indeed is a nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery
almoſt as <hi>eloquently</hi> gifted as himſelf.</p>
            <p>But, among all the ſcurrilities, and abſurdities he is guilty
of, I am moſt of all offended at two things, which conſtantly,
duely, and inſeparably accompany <hi>his</hi> writings, 1. His Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous
<hi>Title-Pages,</hi> and 2ly. <hi>His</hi> abhominable frightful Margent:
As to the firſt of theſe; Any Man now-a-dayes who but ſees a
ſingle ſheet in <hi>Quarto</hi> on a Bookſellers ſtall (be it but <hi>in tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitu)
all-to-be-cloſe-Printed</hi> in the <hi>Front,</hi> he never makes further
enquiry after the Author's name, but preſently makes as quick,
and nimble Conception of <hi>Him,</hi> as a beggar does of an <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe,</hi>
when he ſpies a <hi>Red Latice;</hi> or an <hi>Whoremaſter</hi> of a <hi>Baw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
houſe,</hi> when he ſees a torn <hi>Smock</hi> hang out at the window.
The words in the <hi>Title page</hi> (poor miſcreants!) how they croud
one another for elbow room! truly (in my judgement) the
great Buſh (to uſe the old Saw) renders the wine ſuſpicious,
and may well drive the Reader upon the Poers Interrogatory,</p>
            <q>
               <l>
                  <hi>Quid tanto dignum tulit hic promiſſor hiatu?</hi>
               </l>
               <l>What this ſame Promſer ha's done</l>
               <l>To merit ſo much gaping on?</l>
            </q>
            <p>In general this may be affirmed, that whoever ſhall trouble
himſelf to read over all his works, titles, and all, may ehance at
the concluſion to meet with a fate parallel to that ſame good
Fellow's, who walking the ſtreets early in a morning, found a
Pacquet, curiouſly bound up, and ſeal'd, but having taken the
labour to open the firſt paper of the bundle, he finds another,
and another, and a fourth, fifth, and ſixt paper, till at length he
found in the midd'ſt of all, what think you my Maſters? why,
even (ſaving your preſence) a Surreverence.</p>
            <p>Then for his Margent, or Commentaries, <hi>Tom Farnaby</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:119065:4"/>
cramm'd <hi>Perſius</hi> worſe than he loads himſelf, Quotations,
Statutes, figures, &amp;c. which a man had better believe to be all
as he ſayes, than turn over ſo many volumes to diſprove him:
In a word, I am almoſt ſo fooliſh as to approve of his two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits
who reſembled <hi>His Text, and Comment,</hi> to a <hi>Calve's head</hi>
and <hi>Poartenance;</hi> or an <hi>Owle</hi> encircled with a multitude of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<hi>Birds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I beſeech you Sirs! why <hi>Mr. Prynne</hi> no <hi>Parliament
man</hi> this bout? why muſt he reply with <hi>Bacon's Brazen noddle,
TIME WAS?</hi> why an excluded member? Are <hi>they</hi> not all
<hi>Keepers</hi> of the <hi>Liberty?</hi> and does not <hi>hee</hi> aſſume to himſelf as
much Liberty as any <hi>Freeman</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> or t'other two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?
Truly all the reaſon that I hear of for it, is that which
<hi>exalted him, January</hi> 30. 1637. meerly his <hi>tongue,</hi> and <hi>pen,</hi> the
turbulencies of his language, and abuſe of his <hi>excellent</hi> parts.
The maintaining of a <hi>Paradox</hi> has been counted of old the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry
of great Wits; but then, theſe <hi>Paradoxes</hi> were ſo quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
that their Author's Iudgement might plainly appear to be
clean different from what he therein argued for diſcourſe
ſake. Certainly no man can be ſo farr beſotted to ſuppoſe the
offspring of his Invention (produc'd at firſt probably out of a
frolique) to be in good ſober ſadneſſe a truth, a reality, to be
adhaered unto, admir'd, ador'd, that a man ought to prize it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<hi>fleſh and blood:</hi> I am ſo charitable to believe <hi>His</hi> firſt Eſſay,
in this nature, was intended only for an experiment of <hi>His</hi>
Parts, and Sophiſtry, however it comes to paſſe now that <hi>hee</hi>
ſeems to make that his <hi>Faith,</hi> which was but once at beſt, <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion:</hi>
with the Melancholy Nobleman's Son who once acted
the Beggar's part in a Comoedy, and ever after perſwaded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to be in his whole life, what he had perſonated on the
Stage for one hour. And now what better recreation in the
intervals over a pot of ale, than to produce Mr. <hi>Prynn</hi>'s <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican?</hi>
what better ſport than to hear Mr. <hi>Needham</hi>'s Emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
to cry through the noſe, Mr. <hi>William Prynn's Good Old
Cauſe rightly ſtated, and the bad uncaſed,</hi> &amp;c. All this while, the
whole ſeries of all his deſigns aiming at Authority, and the
Pilots that ſit at the Helm of State. But what are they that
bark at the Moon? The buſie fly makes many an attempt upon
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:119065:4"/>
the candle, till at laſt his ſinged wings compel him to an inglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
retreat. The filth which a man ſpits at Heaven, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
lights on his own pale.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> tells a ſtory concerning the antient <hi>Britons,</hi> that
at their firſt plantation in <hi>Armorica,</hi> being forc'd to take wives
of that Counrtry, they were no ſooner married but they cut their
wives <hi>Tongues</hi> out, to the end (ſayes he) that their Children
might not learn that Country language from their Mothers. A
ſtratagem truly, very commendable: I am not ſo cruel to wiſh
the like doom to our Lawyer, becauſe 'tis his moſt neceſſary im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement;
but I could wiſh it reſtrain'd, and bridled, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the hazard of our Childrens becomming as bad <hi>Shimei</hi>'s
as Himſelf.</p>
            <p>A word or two in the <hi>Quakers</hi> tone; <hi>William Prynne,</hi> ceaſe
thy Scribling; Plague not the Preſſe with rallery any more;
Obey the Magiſtrate; Murther not the Law; Maim not the
<hi>Goſpell;</hi> Ceaſe to ſpeak ill of the Powers above thee; Leave
off thy reviling, evill ſpeaking, thy factious, ſeditious ſpirit; Be
humble, be lowly, leſt a worſe thing betide thee.</p>
            <p>To conclude; I wiſh him a through conviction of his infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
and ſuch a one as may render them as odious to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
as they are to all the VVorld, of ſober, moderate men. I
wiſh him Repentance, and if he be incapable of that, I wiſh
him <hi>once again a Paſtboard Rongrace,</hi> to protect his beauty from
ranning by the Sun-beams, when the State ſhall think fit.</p>
