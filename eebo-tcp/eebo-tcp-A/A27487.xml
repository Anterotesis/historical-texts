            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

that he vvas a Jeſuite, the vvork-men of <hi>Pauls</hi> being hot at

that men may ſee, that this plaine and evident approvement

indifferent <hi>Papist,</hi> but from an <hi>unanimous</hi> conſent of the
<hi>greateſt, zealouſeſt</hi> and <hi>learnedſt</hi> among them. Further, this
ſymbolization of Papiſts and Prelate-men in the name and

againſt the Truth, and thoſe vvho deſire to vvorſhip God in

the Papiſts liking of the Service-book, makes it plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
hovv little God likes it; for if it vvere pleaſing to God,
it vvould never pleaſe the Papiſts: as the Iſraelites true and

Old Teſtament is in <hi>Geneſ. cap. 4. verſ.</hi> 26. the words are
theſe, <hi>Then men began to call upon the name of the Lord:</hi>
as there bee diverſity of thoughts upon the meaning of the

that then they <hi>found out ſome ſet forme or order of
Prayer,</hi> to gaine footing forſooth to the Popiſh <hi>Liturgy;</hi> but
ſay it were ſo, what would it make for them? The Doctors
of <hi>Doway</hi> are of the ſame opinion, and fuller alſo in their

ſome Rites, and ſet forme in a particular place, dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to divine ſervice. Grant that that were the meaning, as
indeed it is not, yet what would this make for them? Would
the <hi>faithfull Prayers</hi> of the godly <hi>Patrtarchs</hi> confirme, or
would they not rather confute the <hi>abhominable prayers</hi> of
the Popiſh <hi>Maſſe?</hi> the word <hi>Invocat</hi> in the firſt language,

               </p>
               <p>The other place which I touch upon, and which they doe

Teſtament, 1 <hi>Tim. 2. verſ 1. I exhort therefore, that firſt of all

the Maſſe are deduced out of the Apoſtle his words,</hi> producing,
or rather traducing; the Fathers making them ſpeake that
for the <hi>Maſſe</hi> which they never meant: the tranſcription of
all the paſſages would be too tedious, but let Maſter <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrights</hi>

by the grand pillars of Popery, <hi>Burgenſis, Lyra, Ianſenius,</hi> and

we muſt give but a touch: wee will begin with that pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
falſhood, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105. 28. which the Booke hath thus,
<hi>They were not obedient to his Word;</hi> but the Scripture ſaith,
<hi>They were not diſobedient to his Word:</hi> what directer contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
can there be than this? the Scripture given by inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Spirit, admitteth no contradiction. Doctor
<hi>Spark</hi> told the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> that it was appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
by the Hiſtory of their dealing in <hi>Egypt;</hi> that to reade,
<hi>They were not obedient to his Word,</hi> were to charge <hi>Moſes</hi> and
<hi>Aaron</hi> with falſhood.</p>

other ſeventy alſo, and ſent them, two and two before them;</hi> but
the common Booke reade ſeventy two: which, though it be
not in matters of faith, as the defendants anſwer, yet it is a
corrupting of the Scripture. May we teare a mans skin from
his fleſh, becauſe we cut not the ſinewes, nor breake not the

               <p>We will trouble you but with one other place,<note place="margin">Sect.</note> and that
upon matter of faith too; namely, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 28. and 48. the

to put all the defenders of the ceremonies to it, which is this:</p>
               <p>That which is mans device, and hath been an Idoll in Gods

up this curſory triall of the matter (for it is no more) how
can the Service-book-men juſtifie theſe words of the Collect

Gentleman, Maſter <hi>Dyton,</hi> ſtifled by his impriſonment in the

others: but becauſe many learned and unanſwerable Treatiſes
are out againſt this diſapproved geſture, it ſhall be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
<hi>actum agere,</hi> to doe a worke ſo often done. It is
true, ſome have attempted to ſay ſomething for it; but in the
ballance of truth, <hi>hoc aliquid nihil eſt,</hi> that ſomething is juſt
nothing. For brevities ſake we will onely ſhut up the piece
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:107617:28"/>
with one binding Argument. To adore in, by, or before a
Creature <hi>reſpectively,</hi> or with a relation to the Creature, is
Idolatry.</p>
               <p>But to kneel at the Sacrament, is to adore, in, by, or before
a Creature, reſpectively, with relation to the Creature. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is Idolatry.</p>
               <p>The explanation of the <hi>termes,</hi> will make the argument
the better underſtood: as, firſt, <hi>adoration</hi> is the higheſt point
of <hi>externall worſhip,</hi> which God will not admit with an
intervenient or relative reſpect to any Creature; for that
makes the Creature <hi>Objectum ſignificative à quo,</hi> that is, the
motive of the worſhip; the termes thus explained: this is
the very ſame argument that our learned Divines ſtop the
Papiſts mouths with, in the point of adoring God mediatly
by the Creature; and as the Papiſts cannot deny the Major;
ſo ſenſe and reaſon, yea, the injunction of the commanders
all verifie the truth of the <hi>Minor</hi> in kneelers; for they cannot
deny the Elements to be the motive of their kneeling, the
concluſion then muſt needs hold; that it is Idolatry diſ-junct
or improper at leaſt, as we argue againſt the Papiſts: but if
the minds of thouſands of ignorant receivers in the Country
were knowne, it is to be feared, they fall foul on conjunct
or proper Idolatrie, making the Bread <hi>objectum determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum:</hi>
in plane, the Bread the object of their worſhip: with
which ſin the Papiſts charge all the Proteſtant-kneelers; for,
<hi>if Chriſt were not there bodily</hi> (ſay the Jeſuits) <hi>we would rather
be racked with horſes than kneel.</hi>

great Commiſſion to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to let his people go,<note place="margin">Exod. 4.</note> and that
both by words and ſignes, namely, <hi>by turning his rod into a
ſerpent,</hi> his <hi>hand made leprous,</hi> and the <hi>waters turned into blood;</hi>
which were not onely to confirm him, in his meſſage, againſt
the feare of his adverſaries, but more particularly to teach
him, that if he withdrew himſelfe, in part, or in whole,
from the worke, the Plague of Leproſie, of Blood, and
Biting with Serpents, ſhould be upon him; yea, God put
<hi>Moſes</hi> upon a preſent tryall of Obedience and Faith, by cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
him to take the Serpent by the tayle, notwithſtanding
of the danger to be bitten by it: we ſpeake to the wiſe, who
can apply it better then we.</p>

               <p>THe third Motive for removall of this Booke, may be
taken from the <hi>Proteſtation</hi> dated <hi>May</hi> 5. 1641. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
ſent abroad, and ſolemnly ſworne unto; yea, and
bound up with a publique Covenant, on the publike day of
Thankſgiving, by Miniſters and People, ſo that it is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable

                  <note place="margin">Nehe. 9. 38</note> which is there called <hi>a ſure Covenant, a
written Covenant, to which our Princes, Miniſters and People
ſeale unto,</hi> from which we cannot depart, except we will

Emblemed out unto us in Scripture, by dividing
of the Sacrifices,<note place="margin">Gen. 15. 17</note> and cauſing the parties to goe <hi>betwixt them,</hi>
admoniſhing, that God will ſo divide them in his wrath, if
they forſake the Covenant: The ſubject of the Covenant
conſiſteth of three parts:<note place="margin">Jer. 34. 18.</note> In the firſt we are ſworne and tyed
to maintaine all the Rights of Religion, King, and State: In
the ſecond, to oppoſe all Perſons and Things, that do oppoſe
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:107617:39"/>
the three former mentioned, and more ſpecifically, to oppoſe
with all our life and power, all Popery and Popiſh Innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which Expreſſions are thrice mentioned; once in the
Proteſtation, or oath, and twice in the Explanation: the
third and laſt piece of the ſubject, is the Peace of the three
Kingdomes, England, Scotland, and Ireland, which we by
Oath are alſo bound to maintaine: Hence two Arguments
will offer themſelves; one more directly, and the other by
way of conſequence.</p>
               <p>For the former,<note place="margin">Sect.</note> if all Popery and Popiſh Innovations are
to be oppoſed, then it will follow, that the <hi>Service booke</hi> and
Ceremonies ſhould be oppoſed, and by conſequence, by your
Authority aboliſhed, <hi>Verba Statuti ſunt amplianda, non re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringenda,</hi>
the words of Acts and Statutes for good, and
againſt evil, are to be taken in the largeſt extent: but the
words themſelves, are univerſall enough. Now that the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice-Book
and Ceremonies therein contained, and preſſed
upon mens Conſciences, are Popery, We, and many others
have cleared; yea they are Popiſh Innovations, <hi>Nam omnia quae
à Christo non ſunt, nova ſunt,</hi> all things that are not from our
King Chriſt in his worſhip, are meere Innovations, as <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi>

upſtart: ſo one, and all of them, are Exotick and upſtart
things; It is true indeed by the Malignity of the Maſters
of thoſe Ceremonies, the bulke was increaſed, and would
have been like the Crocodiles, who grow ſo long as they
have a being; if you had not come in place of the Tutyrites,
a creature terrible to the Crocodiles, which leapeth upon their
backs and brings them to the ſhoare; but otherwiſe for the
kinde,<note place="margin">Plin. lib. 8. cap. 25.</note> they are all <hi>non ejuſdem farinae, ſed furfuris,</hi> the ſame
kinde of Bran; and as the Woman ſaid of the Foxes, <hi>If one
be good; all are good.</hi> For the further confirmation, that they
are Popiſh, we have proof, from that Treatiſe of Ceremonies
annexed to the Service-Booke;<note place="margin">Bible in the Dutch letter, <hi>An.</hi> 1561.</note> in ſome antient Copies we
have read, <hi>that they thought good to retaine ſome Popiſh Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies:</hi>
but in another Coppy they call them <hi>the old Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies

               <p>The latter argument, from the <hi>Proteſtantion,</hi>

which is impoſſible to be done, in the Opinion of our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
the Scots, without Identity of Diſcipline and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip;
witneſſe the very words of the Arguments, by the
Scottiſh Commiſſioners, given to the Lords of the Treaty,
perſwading Conformity in theſe, to be the chiefe meanes of
Peace.</p>
               <p>We vvill tranſcribe ſome paſſages, for all vve cannot, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

                  <note place="margin">Pag. 2.</note>
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Arguments that they uſe, are firſt, from the Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Plots of Treaſon, like to blow up all, if they be not

of this Peace, according to our Power; We can look for no
Peace with God, nor bleſſing from God; if we give way to
that, or ſuffer that, according to our power, that breaketh this
peace. They ſay in the Preface of the Ceremonies, <hi>that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

and Worſhip, witneſſe the putting of the Arke upon

the words without forcing, to overturne that which croſſeth
the Truth and Peace of Religion and State: as Meanes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce

not removed. And now ſince (under favour) We have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
to inlarge our ſelves in this point of Peace, We beg
leave of your Honours to ſpeake a word, or two of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probabilities
of Peace here among our ſelves, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movall
of that ſtumbling block, the Service-Booke. People

Lives and Being. When <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great, was about

There is neceſſity of Sayling, but not of Living: and in this

Scotland, be a ſeaſonable Caveat to us and all other Nations,
to ſtrike with Authority, leſt that which ſhould be done with
the Right hand, be done unhappily with the Left hand.</p>
               <p>Here might be place for another Motive, namely, from the

you ſhall be called the Saviours upon Mount Zion in ſetting

all the rabble of the Ceremonies, it is mans device, and hath
beene an Idoll in Gods worſhip.</p>
                  <p>Therefore in the worſhip of God, it muſt be an Idoll ſtill.
The Antecedent no man will deny, for it hath beene the

               <p>Secondly, this is not Gods courſe in reforming of his

out into an uncleane place, as hath beene ſaid; ſo polluted
pieces of Idolatrous ſervice,<note place="margin">Lev. 14. 43.</note> are not to be brought by any
cleanſing, into the Houſe of God; God commandeth his
people to throw downe the Altars of the <hi>Canaanite:</hi> where
under Altars are comprehended all other abominations; they
were not to ſet a new trim upon any of them, but becauſe
they obeyed not the Lord, they ſmarted for it. Bleſſed bee

good hope you will not leave a Popiſh Relique in the Land,

that Maſter <hi>Wommock</hi> ſpeakes of, will be no better then
<hi>paring of the nayles,</hi> and <hi>ſhaving of the haire,</hi> which as the
Great <hi>Turke</hi> ſaid of his Army, <hi>will quickly grow againe;</hi> yea,
and grow againe the faſter too: good medicines in naturall
things may be extracted out of ranke poyſons, but ſo cannot
pure worſhip out of things polluted, being mans inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
therefore the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> telleth us,<note place="margin">Eſa. 30. 22.</note> that nothing will

               <p>The fifth and laſt objection,<note place="margin">5. <hi>Object. Sect.</hi>
                  </note> is from <hi>Acts of Parliament,</hi>
which the <hi>Service-book-men</hi> make the ſtaffe of their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
and yet in truth, being well tryed, it ſhall be found,
that they abuſe the ſtate and conſciences of men moſt groſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Doctor <hi>Hall</hi> and others, ſtrike much on that ſtring, as
<hi>Parliamentary Acts peremptorily eſtabliſhment;</hi> yet they make
but very harſh Muſicke. A man would thinke that Doctor
<hi>Hall,</hi> being a learned Divine, would firſt have laid this <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi>
of <hi>Liturgy</hi> in the <hi>ballance of the Sanctuary,</hi> and tryed the
weight of it there, and if it had proved too light, (as ſurely it
would) then to have counted it a piacle againſt God and
man; to offer to make up the waight with humane Lawes.
It is not unworthy your remembrance, how one of the later
brood of the <hi>Scotriſh</hi> Prelates, alleadging, or rather miſ-al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leading
before our late Soveraigne King <hi>Iames,</hi> ſome <hi>Act of
Parliament,</hi> for the eſtabliſhing and maintenance of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy;
the King asked a Noble-man being by, being a great
<hi>Legiſt</hi> and Officer of State, what he thought of thoſe <hi>Acts?</hi>
the Noble-man replyed, <hi>That it went never well with them,
ſince their Church men laboured more to be verſed in the Acts
of Parliament, than in the Acts of the Apostles.</hi> But to the
matter for all this cry, we are more than halfe confident, they
ſhall have but little wooll for the <hi>Service-booke</hi> from the Acts
of State, when they are well looked into. Wee know not
any colour of confirmation for this <hi>Service-booke,</hi> except that
Statute prefixed to it,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 6. 2.</note> which how little it maketh for it, let
the words of the Statute teſtifie, of which we ſhall ſet downe
thoſe that are moſt pertinent; for it is needleſſe to write
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:107617:43"/>
them all. In the fifth and ſixth yeare of King <hi>Edward</hi> the
ſixth, an Act was made for the eſtabliſhing of a Booke, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>The Booke of Common-prayer,</hi> the which was repealed in
the firſt yeare of Queene <hi>Mary,</hi> which Statute of repeale
was made voide by this ſame Act the firſt yeare of Queene
<hi>Elizabeth;</hi> and that the aforeſaid Booke, with the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and additions therein added, ſhall ſtand and be; and
all Miniſters ſhall uſe the ſaid Booke, authorized by <hi>Act of
Parliament</hi> in the ſaid fifth and ſixth yeare of King <hi>Edward</hi>
the ſixth, and no other. This is the ſumme of the Statute, in
relation to the Subject, namely, <hi>What Service-booke it is that
the Statute eſtabliſheth;</hi> and for any thing we can ſee, there is
not one paſſage or title for confirmation, or eſtabliſhing any
other <hi>Service-booke,</hi> but that of King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth; divers
Miniſters in King <hi>Iames</hi> his time urged vvith ſubſcription,
anſwered the Prelates, <hi>True it was, that if they refuſed, they
and theirs were like to bee deſolated; but if they yeelded, they
ſhould make themſelves tranſgreſſours of the Lawes of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
in ſubſcribing to another Booke than that, eſtabliſhed by
Law:</hi> the Prelates in preſſing this ſubſcription, forced two
Statutes, namely, the Statute alleadged by the change of the
Booke;<note place="margin">13. Eliz. cap. 12.</note> and alſo another Statute requiring no ſubſcription,
but barely to the <hi>Articles of Religion,</hi> which onely concerne
the <hi>Confeſſion of true Christian faith, and the Doctrine of the
Sacraments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now,<note place="margin">Sect.</note> to come to further anſwer; let us grant by way of
Confeſſion that there were an Act, or Acts for ratifying of
the Booke, which in <hi>terminis</hi> we cannot ſee, (as Statutes uſe
to be expreſſed) yet by the Law of charity and duty, we hold
our ſelves bound to beleeve, that a State profeſſing the truth
of Religion, would never inact ſo, for a <hi>Service-booke</hi> of mans
device, as that it might be a ſnare to the people of God, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
other ends; as a kinde of <hi>uniformity, ſupply for want of
Miniſtery, and bringing Papists to the Church,</hi> but not to preſſe
it in the bulke beyond the ſpheare of any mans Conſcience,
witneſſe a Rubricke in King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth his Booke; but
give it to ſpeake as punctually for the Booke as they would
have it, ſhall it be ſimply good? for that, it is onely in the
power of a divine Statute ſimply to make a thing good, all
<hi>Divines, Humanists,</hi> and <hi>Lawyers,</hi> that have written on the

very pertinently to the Hierarchie, proving it to be
the Maſter-ſin, wherewith the Church and State are peſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and for which eſpecially, God hath a controverſie with
us, becauſe it is decreed by a Law; and as a Law for the Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchie
proved of no force to keepe it up, no more then the
late Lawes of Scotland could uphold their Prelates: ſo
grant that there were a Law for the Service-book, the thing
being naught, what could it help it? Within theſe hundred
yeeres there was a Law in England, for the Popes ſuprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
ſay that were not repealed, ſtood it either with Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
Religion or Loyalty to ſubmit unto it? Yea, ſome frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Lawes are yet unrepealed in this land, that no ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious
man will obey: neither have we alledged thoſe evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
upon this ſuſpition, to encounter with any Statutes;
but to ſtop the mouthes of thoſe men, who would make the
Statute-Law a blinde guide, under which their unlawfull cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
and ſuperſtitious ſervice, might march furiouſly againſt
the word of truth.</p>
               <p>Now,<note place="margin">Sect.</note> to come to an end, (for we are ſorry we could be
no briefer) we will onely anſwer this <hi>Quaere,</hi> conſiſting of
theſe two heads: Firſt, whether we do approve of any <hi>ſet-prayer</hi>
in a more private way: And ſecondly, whether we
do approve of any <hi>ſet-liturgie</hi> in publike; to both theſe we
anſwer ingenuouſly as we thinke; and for the former, we do
thinke that parties in their infancie or ignorance, may uſe
<hi>formes</hi> of <hi>prayer,</hi> well and wholſomely ſet, for helps and props
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:107617:44"/>
of their imbecillity, yea, riper Chriſtians may do well to read
ſuch profitable formes, the matter whereof may by ſetting
of their affections on edge, prepare and fit them as matter of
Meditation, the better for Prayer; but for thoſe parties ſo
to continue without progreſſe to <hi>conceived prayer;</hi> were as if
children ſhould ſtill be poring upon ſpelling, and never learne
to reade; or, as if children or weak ſhould ſtill go by hold, or
upon crutches, and never go right out. We may ſay of <hi>ſet-prayer</hi>
uſed for infirmity, as Divines ſay of the <hi>legall ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi>
in the <hi>interim,</hi> that they were tolerable, not neceſſary;
and ſo vvhatſoever is, or may be ſaid in the behalfe of it, is
not ſo much (as vve conceive) for the commendation of it,
as for the toleration of it for a time; and for giving ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to ſcrupulous conſciences, for the vvarrantable uſe of it
in caſe of neceſſity.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond head;<note place="margin">Sect.</note> for a <hi>ſet forme of Liturgia in publique</hi>
vve anſvver, that vvith all the <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> vve do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovv
a <hi>ſound forme</hi> of <hi>ſet-liturgie,</hi> as an exampler, or preſident
of our performance of holy ordinance, but ſo, that none ſhould
tie himſelfe, or be tied to thoſe <hi>Prayers, Exhortations,</hi> and
other things, in the Liturgie, much leſſe ſhould it be violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thruſt upon any Miniſter or people; vvhich proves in very
deed a limiting of the ſpirit, eſpecially, in a Miniſter able to
pray in and by the holy Ghoſt, yea, it is a very tranſplantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Eſſence or Nature of Prayer, vvherein the vvords
are to follovv the affections, and not the affections the
vvords, as it doth in the beſt ſet formes, but for our Liturgie,
vvhat can be ſaid for formes, or hath been ſaid, that cannot
be ſaid for the Popiſh Liturgie; but the clothing it in another
tongue; yet this is preſſed under great penalty, upon all the
Miniſters;<note place="margin">Canon 38.</note> vvho, if they had the tongues of Angels, they
ſhould not pray, till every rag and remnant of that be ſaid. To
ſhut up the buſineſſe, if this Liturgie, <hi>idque caput mali,</hi> being
the head piece of our evill vvere put avvay, vve ſhould have
no more ado about ſuch a Liturgie; then the Maſters of the
Synagogue had, vvhen after the reading of the Lavv and the
Prophets,<note place="margin">Acts 13. 15</note> they deſired <hi>Paul</hi> to preach, vvhere vvithout que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
