         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Ne would think <hi>you</hi> were <hi>at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> with the <hi>Company of Statio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> and, as their <hi>Pensioner,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in constant Pay; For of late a man cannot write a <hi>private</hi> Letter to you, but forthwith you <hi>Print</hi> it: And though
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94128:3"/>
               <hi>All</hi> of you be in the <hi>fault,</hi> yet the <hi>Innocent Sheet</hi> does the <hi>Pennance</hi> on the Book-seller's <hi>Stall;</hi> Or <hi>stands,</hi> like a poor <hi>Greek,</hi> or some Mountebanks <hi>Bill,</hi> at every Pillar and Post, to be <hi>gaz'd</hi> on, if not laugh'd at.</p>
            <p>I know what you'l say; that all this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty I now put on, is but a meer Copy of my Countenance; and that indeed and in truth, (you keeping the Key to the Press,) I had not writ to you above all others, but on purpose that you might open the Press-door, and let me in, with <hi>Imprimatur</hi> R. L.</p>
            <p>Which Pass-port had been set down in the first place, (as commonly it is,) like a Ticket, in hand, to get into the Play-house, but that the Book-sellers like it not.</p>
            <p>For they, (honest men,) knowing the worth of a Book only by the ready sale, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the people have got an opinion, (and then there's no beating it out of their heads,) and have taken such a prejudice against Books so <hi>mark'd</hi> in the <hi>forehead,</hi> that construing it to be a <hi>Brand</hi> of Infamy, they will scarce ask the price of them, or bid a penny:</p>
            <p>Taking it for granted, the Author so li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens'd, was some dull Phlegmatick fellow, and either wanted wit or honesty to vouch himself.</p>
            <p>To tell you the plain truth on't, and not to lie; It was neither the <hi>Importunity</hi> of friends,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94128:3"/>
of the <hi>Stationer</hi> in particular; nor the <hi>near approach</hi> of the next <hi>Term;</hi> nor very much <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst my will;</hi> nor to <hi>Cancel</hi> the <hi>obligations</hi> many and great to his <hi>Worship,</hi> her Lady-ship, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> neither as a <hi>Testimony of great thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;</hi> nor out of penury and want of a <hi>better Offering;</hi> nor any of the like <hi>stale</hi> Pretexts, that <hi>now</hi> set my Pen a work:</p>
            <p>But of my own accord, meer motion, and advice; mine own dear fingers <hi>itch'd</hi> to be <hi>at it;</hi> till I had finish'd and dispatch'd the Pac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, in this <hi>Express.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherein is inclosed and wrapt up a <hi>bundle</hi> of <hi>serious</hi> and honest <hi>Truths,</hi> as if <hi>held forth</hi> from <hi>Pulpit</hi> it self.</p>
            <p>But (I confess) <hi>they</hi> are, (like my self) <hi>merrily dispos'd;</hi> yet purposely <hi>so dress'd,</hi> that the <hi>wholsom food</hi> therein contain'd, not <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gusting</hi> the Palate of this <hi>humorsome</hi> and <hi>frothy</hi> Age, might <hi>rellish</hi> the better, and go <hi>merrily down.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed it is a Quelque-chose, here and there a little <hi>Tart</hi> sometimes, but without <hi>gall</hi> or Bitterness; and here and there a Bit so <hi>sharp</hi> too, as, (like mustard,) to <hi>bite the Tongue</hi> of a sinner; but it is only to make his eyes water, and bring him to repentance; and the better digestion of his former crudities.</p>
            <p>If you <hi>suspect</hi> the Truth of all this, as rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a Party <hi>concern'd,</hi> (for who is not <hi>in</hi>

               <hi>Love</hi> with his <hi>own</hi> Issue, though <hi>Crouch-back'd,</hi> or <hi>Crook-legg'd?)</hi> then read not one Sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble more, 'tis alike to me, for I shall not get a penny by your custome; neither do I desire it. For I am <hi>well and warm;</hi> and wish all Mankind so; and to doe what in me lies for the <hi>common</hi> Bene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>t do I now write.</p>
            <p>Praying that all men were of my Religion, (contain'd in this Letter) and then the world would need neither stocks nor Gaol; neither <hi>Inquisition,</hi> nor Surrogate; neither Act of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempnity,</hi> nor <hi>Uniformity;</hi> neither Drums, nor Colours; Swords, nor Helmets; Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balls, nor little Cutto's; <hi>Red-Coats,</hi> nor <hi>men of War:</hi> nor have any great use of those two lately-found out Inventions, Printing and Gunpowder; (and whether of them has most troubled the world, I will not take upon me <hi>here</hi> to discuss; yet I think the latter has not prov'd so mischievous as is suppos'd; Battles having been before the use of Gunpowder, the most bloody.)</p>
            <p>But if you think, this Preface is all but <hi>Quack,</hi> and promises more, like an <hi>Empiricks</hi> Bill, than can be perform'd upon Tryal and proof; and has more in the <hi>Contents</hi> than in the <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> then let the rest alone, for I write not to an <hi>Infidel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet the greatest part of the world is so: and a pretty quantity of the lesser part is inhabited,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94128:4"/>
(some think) by people, that either have fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads of brass, or no eyes in their foreheads: I mean Knaves and Fools.</p>
            <p>Knaves <hi>will</hi> not, and Fools <hi>can</hi> not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand my meaning in this following Letter.</p>
            <p>And thus far by way of Preface.</p>
            <p>At the <hi>Rainbow-Coffee-house</hi> the other day, taking my place at due distance, not far from me, at another Table sat a whole <hi>Cabal</hi> of wits; made up of Virtuoso's, Ingenioso's, young Students of the Law, two Citizens, and to make the Jury full, <hi>vouz avez,</hi> one old Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman: his bald Pate cover'd with a huffing Peruke, without an <hi>Eye</hi> of gray in't, or one gray-hair.</p>
            <p>But I knew him to be Old, because they all laughing heartily and gaping, I took that occasion, to look him in the mouth, and knew his Age, for indeed the mark was out of his mouth. I was tickled to know the cause of all this mirth, and presently found, it was a <hi>Book</hi> made all this sport; the Title of it, <hi>The Rehearsal transpros'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Look you here, says one of them, do not you see, p. 309. how smartly he <hi>ferrets</hi> the old <hi>Foxes,</hi> the Fathers of the Church? (as in biting <hi>Irony,</hi> he calls the old Bishops:) and how he <hi>claws off</hi> one of them by name, <hi>A. Sparrow</hi> D. D. Bishop of Exon? nay scratches one out
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94128:5"/>
of the Grave, <hi>L. Andrews</hi> late Bishop of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester?</hi> He's a notorious bold fellow, I'le warrant him, sayes another; he takes up the old Fathers like so many School-boys; and like a stout <hi>Pedant,</hi> or <hi>Priscian</hi> himself, he whips one of them publickly, and gives him chastisement for his worthy cares, because he had no better ply'd his Book.</p>
            <p>But he goes a <hi>little higher,</hi> says a <hi>Third,</hi> if in the same page, you look a <hi>little lower:</hi> and turns up his Majesties <hi>Evil Councellors,</hi> and gives one slash at a great <hi>Minister of State,</hi> with great courage pulling the dead Lion by the beard.</p>
            <p>I like it not at all, and the Author much worse, says the old Gentleman; it sounds so like the <hi>old cry</hi> of <hi>London-</hi>Town in 1642. <hi>Down with the Bishops, Down;</hi> Down with the <hi>Evil Councellors,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That do so keep us off, we cannot come at the <hi>King;</hi> and therefore it is we can never have him at our wills, to deal <hi>kindly</hi> by him, for his <hi>own</hi> good, and for <hi>reformation,</hi> to make <hi>him then a glorious King;</hi> therefore, <hi>down with the Bishops,</hi> down with Evil Councellors.</p>
            <p>The man is desperately disingenuous and <hi>unnatural,</hi> (I think) whosoever was the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor;</hi> he plays the <hi>Tarrier,</hi> by his falling on so fiercely upon the <hi>old Foxes,</hi> the fathers of the Church; and by that, should be some <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cars</hi> son.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:94128:5"/>
For the <hi>Tarrier</hi> you know, is a <hi>monstrous</hi> beast, begot of a <hi>bitch,</hi> by a <hi>Fox,</hi> and so is <hi>half-dog,</hi> and <hi>half-fox:</hi> but there is no such enemy, in the world, to a <hi>fox,</hi> as is the <hi>Tarrier</hi> which is a part of him, though an Amphibious and degenerate <hi>Issue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I think, (replyed another) he is rather a <hi>Jaccal,</hi> (which is an <hi>Arabian</hi> beast, but more <hi>monstrous</hi> in the <hi>odd</hi> humour of his <hi>rapacity)</hi> robbing the <hi>graves,</hi> and scratching up for a prey the <hi>dead</hi> Corps, that lay decently interr'd, as by name Bishop <hi>Andrews,</hi> Bishop <hi>Bramhall,</hi> Arch-Bishop <hi>Usher,</hi> Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud;</hi> and a glorious <hi>Martyr,</hi> worth them all, King <hi>Charles</hi> I.</p>
            <p>It is a <hi>marvel</hi> (saith another) what you will make of this <hi>New Author,</hi> at the long run; for you have made him a <hi>Ferret,</hi> a <hi>Tarrier,</hi> and a <hi>Jaccall</hi> already; The Gentleman himself has reduc'd <hi>thus many</hi> Metaphors within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of one bare sentence, p. 49. setching a <hi>Cònjurer,</hi> a <hi>Play-house,</hi> and a <hi>Ferret</hi> to make it up: sure his <hi>Rhetorick</hi> was born in a time when <hi>Metaphors</hi> were cheap; for though they be <hi>far fetch'd,</hi> yet sure they were not <hi>dear bought,</hi> he is so <hi>prodigal</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>Well said (saith a young <hi>Lawyer)</hi> I will bestow <hi>one Metaphor</hi> the more upon him for his <hi>liberality:</hi> He seems to me, to be a <hi>Cots<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>would-Hare,</hi> he's so well breathed, he has stood

               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:94128:6"/>
the Pattern to the life. As there is a Law in <hi>England</hi> against <hi>wolves,</hi> so, if I were a <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment man,</hi> I would <hi>move</hi> for a law against <hi>Jaccalls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This Jaccall</hi> is an unsufferable beast in <hi>our</hi> Soyl, especially when no dead corps pleases his Palate so much, as those <hi>sacred</hi> Reliques of Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud,</hi> especially those of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands Martyr,</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>For he that beheaded <hi>these two</hi> was not half so <hi>barbarous,</hi> nor did do them half so much harm, as this <hi>Gregory Father-Grey-beard,</hi> who with his utmost <hi>malice</hi> and <hi>inveteracy</hi> strikes at their <hi>Innocence</hi> and <hi>Honour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For which cause,</hi> (though such a <hi>Barbarian</hi> ought not to be <hi>Christned,</hi> yet) <hi>He</hi> having <hi>no name,</hi> the Company <hi>did,</hi> (as <hi>He did</hi> to Mr. <hi>Bayes,)</hi> give him <hi>a name,</hi> by <hi>which</hi> he was known amongst them <hi>to this day,</hi> calling him, for his <hi>merits-sake,</hi> (as <hi>we</hi> do hereafter) <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory Father-Grey-beard;</hi> or, Mr. <hi>Gregory,</hi> and sometimes plain <hi>Greg.</hi>

               <p>I can more willingly lose my Crowns, than my Credit; nor are my Kingdomes so dear to me, as my Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and Honour: Those must have a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod with my Life, but these may surviveto a glorious kind of Immortality, when I am dead and gone; and a sweet consecrating of them to an eternity of Love and gratitude among Posterity.</p>
               <p>Those foul and false aspersions were secret Engines at first employed against my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Love of me, that undermining their opinion and value of me, my enemies and theirs too, might at once blow up their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and batter down their Loyalty.</p>
            </q>
            <p>This in <hi>practice,</hi> (what ever be the <hi>design)</hi> is endeavour'd in this Book p. 301. with as much venome as can be spit; asserting there, that <hi>the whole Reign</hi> of King <hi>Charles</hi> 1. was <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We had a good wise King (the while) then, and fit to live and Reign, that would suffer his <hi>whole Reign</hi> to be <hi>deform'd.</hi> Thus making him a <hi>Pupill,</hi> rather than a <hi>Prince;</hi> and one that of himself regarded not what was good; but was kept during his whole Reign under a Tutor and Guardian, or rather Governour; and he, <hi>viz.</hi> Arch. Bishop <hi>Laud,</hi> one of the worst too, for <hi>he</hi> sayes, <hi>he seem'd to know nothing but</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:94128:7"/>
Ceremonies, Arminianisme, and Manwaring: <hi>with that he begun, and with that he ended, and thereby deform'd the whole Reign</hi> of King <hi>Charles</hi> 1. p. 301.</p>
            <p>Thus he makes our <hi>Solomon,</hi> a <hi>Rehoboam;</hi> namely a child at forty years of age.</p>
            <p>By <hi>Ceremonies, Arminianisme, and Manwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring;</hi> whatever they be in themselves, this <hi>Author</hi> represents them as very vile, wicked and ugly things, because <hi>they deform'd the Kings whole Reign.</hi> And therefore he concludes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that King <hi>Charles</hi> 1. had no <hi>wisdom</hi> to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the vileness, wickedness, and ugli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of these three things, <hi>Ceremonies, Arminia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme, and Manwaring,</hi> whereby his whole Reign was deform'd; or else that King <hi>Charles</hi> understanding the evil nature of these things that did deforme his whole Reign, had not <hi>honesty,</hi> nor <hi>innocence</hi> enough to keep them off, from <hi>deforming his whole Reign.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So choose him whether, for this <hi>Author</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines him necessarily in these words, to be either so much a <hi>fool</hi> as to suffer his whole Reign to be deform'd with <hi>Ceremonies, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minianisme,</hi> and <hi>Manwaring;</hi> and to be <hi>led</hi> by a man, that <hi>seem'd to know nothing else;</hi> with which he <hi>begun, and with which he ended, and thereby deform'd the whole Reign:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or else, <hi>knowing</hi> these things, and how they deform'd his whole Reign; he makes
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94128:8"/>
him a vile and <hi>wicked King</hi> that would not save and deliver his whole Reign from defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>
            <p>By the <hi>former</hi> he makes him a <hi>weak</hi> prince, without wisdome; the contrary whereof is known to the whole world, and was never suggested before this time, by any but the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells</hi> in the beginning of the late Civil-wars, to withdraw the affections of his people from him, as from a man that had not wit nor <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding</hi> enough to govern them, but was led by the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> and Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop-<hi>Laud.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if he mean the <hi>latter,</hi> that all this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity was his own doings, and that though his Reign was deform'd, it was <hi>himself,</hi> his <hi>own</hi> Inclinations and bent which contriv'd, at least concurr'd, in making his <hi>whole Reign de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd;</hi> then and even then, it is the <hi>old cry</hi> of the Rebells, who when they had got their wills of the Earl of <hi>Strafford;</hi> and Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop <hi>Laud,</hi> and left the <hi>King</hi> no Councellors, nor Kingdomes, nor so much as liberty; then changed their note, and justified the <hi>Evil Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors,</hi> more than the <hi>King</hi> himself; saying <hi>he</hi> himself was his <hi>own</hi> wicked Councellor, and a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> and ought to <hi>die:</hi> And though their words (like these of this Authour) were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villish and malicious; yet they were <hi>as good as their words,</hi> and condemn'd him for a <hi>Tyrant,</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:94128:8"/>
and cut off his head. 'Tis indeed (answered another) all you say is infallibly true, and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable</hi> to a Tittle; but that which is <hi>admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,</hi> and a greater <hi>Marvel,</hi> is the skill and cunning of the man.</p>
            <p>He does the feat so cleaverly, as if he shot with <hi>white Powder;</hi> did <hi>execution</hi> indeed ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually, but makes no <hi>noyse,</hi> or evil <hi>Report;</hi> (like other unskilful and <hi>bawling</hi> Phanaticks;) for though you stare about, you shall not see the Executioner, nor know <hi>whence</hi> the shot comes; or if you do, he puts his vizard on presently, and looks, (like <hi>Faux)</hi> in disguise. Or, as the <hi>Mountebank,</hi> keeping a man, who is content to be slash'd and cut, that his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster may thereby show his Dexterity and skill in the Cure; so this <hi>Virtuoso</hi> wounds and cuts (but indeed with design) mortally; and with matchless courage and boldness, (disdaining trivial force) fights neither with small nor great, (except they lye in his way and detard Royal assassination) but only the King of our <hi>Israel;</hi> against whom when he has spit his venome, and with bold and home thrusts as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted his Innocence and honour;</p>
            <p>Yet he has his <hi>Playster</hi> at hand, (though it be without vertue) and would seem to make all whole again, with crying, Oh Lord! Sir, <hi>I beg your pardon;</hi> and then; as you were: All is <hi>well</hi> again.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:94128:9"/>
The <hi>Playster</hi> (which he would make <hi>Alexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pharmacal</hi> for the wounds with which our late Soveraign is attempted, and made, together with his whole Reign, deform'd,) is the nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test of all; and clapt on as soon as the blow is struck, p. 301. deform'd the whole Reign—of the best Prince that ever wielded the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Scepter.</p>
            <p>A contradiction <hi>in terminis,</hi> and as barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous as absolute.</p>
            <p>For how could he <hi>possibly</hi> be the best Prince that ever wielded the English Scepter, except all the Princes that ever wielded the English Scepter had their whole Reigns deform'd, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by their carelesness or folly; or, (which is the less affront to be call'd <hi>Knave</hi> rather than <hi>fool,</hi> because one may be help'd, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is remediless) by vileness and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness doing the work themselves, and defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming their whole Reign.</p>
            <p>Again, if he be the best Prince that ever wielded the English Scepter, and yet either <hi>did</hi> deform his whole Reign, or <hi>suffered</hi> it to be deform'd with <hi>Ceremonies, Arminianisme, and Manwaring;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then these <hi>three</hi> Reign-deforming Buggs, <hi>Ceremonies, Arminianisme, and Manwaring</hi> are very consistent with the best Prince that ever wielded the English Scepter.</p>
            <p>And if so, then these three Reign-defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94128:9"/>
               <hi>Buggs,</hi> are indeed but Buggs, and <hi>fright</hi> men more than <hi>burt</hi> them, and can <hi>scare</hi> none but children and fools.</p>
            <p>For that the best Prince that ever <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> had, owns, cherishes them, or at least permits them to be own'd and cherish'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all other things; and owns (above all other men) <hi>the man</hi> that seemed to know <hi>nothing else but these Ceremonies, Arminianisme, and Manwaring;</hi> with which he begun and with which he ended.</p>
            <p>And <hi>all this</hi> must necessarily follow, or else those good English Princes that kept off, or expelled out of, their Kingdomes, these same three ugly Reign-deforming things; were <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> Princes than <hi>He</hi> that either brought them in, kept them in, or suffered them to stay in, and thereby deform'd his whole Reign.</p>
            <p>And if they, (in doing <hi>so well,</hi> and much <hi>better</hi> than he) were <hi>better</hi> Princes than he; how could he be the <hi>best</hi> Prince that ever wielded the English Scepter?</p>
            <p>So egregiously confident, and self-conceited is this <hi>Virtuoso</hi> Authour, this new <hi>Politician;</hi> that, (through the high value he has for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; together with the mean and low esteem he has for all others) thinks so slightly and easily to Gull them; and casting a little mist before their eyes, hopes to lead them about, like fools by the nose.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:94128:10"/>
Otherwise this fool-hardy man would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have been so lost to all modesty and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, as to think to impose upon men, and be juggle them by such transparent mists, and <hi>easie Legerdemain;</hi> namely plain down-right Non-sense and Contradiction.</p>
            <p>Alas! the <hi>man</hi> is not master of his Trade! And yet, as if he onely, and the rest of the new Politicians and <hi>Virtuoso</hi>'s, were like the <hi>Chinenses</hi> and had two eyes in their heads; but all the rest of the world blind; or, (at least) the best of them but single-ey'd men; who with but one eye are not so very quick-sight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, especially if you come upon them on the blind side.</p>
            <p>The Company seem'd wonderfully well pleas'd with this discourse; all of them but the <hi>Virtuoso</hi>'s <hi>and Ingenioso</hi>'s; who were but four in all, and they too answered not one word: whether troubled with the Fret, and at the heart too mad and enrag'd to utter a word, hearing themselves thus check'd to the face; and their Brother <hi>Virt—</hi>(who but a little before they had cry'd up for such a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digie and <hi>Marvel</hi> of wit) should so suddenly be charg'd home with so unavoidable a shock; whilst they stood by, and idly looking on, had neither ability nor wit enough to make resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, nor knew how to help themselves nor <hi>Him:</hi> yet, (to see how soon the wind turns!
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94128:10"/>
and how suddenly smiling Dame Fortune can knit her brows!) if he had but come into the Room one half hour before, the whole Clubb had rouz'd at the happy surprize of this won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful wit; and had carried the Bugg upon their shoulders (like the <hi>Knight</hi> of the shire on Election-day) in Triumph about the Room: and had given him as many thanks for his great pains in this admirable Book, as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors friend I.

At least these <hi>Virtuoso</hi>'s would have clap'd him on the back and spit in his <hi>mouth;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>it</hi> did so double and spend, when this <hi>Mopsus</hi> did open so well upon the hot scent against Bayes p. 150. with whoop, Holla, Holla, whoop; ten times one after another; and with so full a mouth, that sure he has been us'd to't; and has some <hi>Thestylis</hi> to his Mistress, whose Nephew <hi>Amyntas</hi> is out of his wits.</p>
            <p>Or whether the Arguments against their friend were all <hi>ad hominem,</hi> and made the Indited and Criminal to prove the evidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst himself, and by his own mouth and confession, or acknowledged all under his own hand; and thereby necessarily stopping their mouths, as if they had been <hi>silenc'd</hi> by a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, or Thunder-struck.</p>
            <p>Or lastly, whether they were afraid to be laugh'd at the more, by answering nothing to the purpose, and thereby <hi>once more</hi> shame the Authour, their order, and themselves; as being loth further to stir in that (Sir Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence) that already was so noysome, and smelt above ground; I cannot tell.</p>
            <p>But now they answered only with a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance made up 'twixt wrath and discontent, having not altogether so great an eye of scorn and self-conceit in the mixture; and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I was glad to see it, for mine own sake.</p>
            <p>For being but a plain blunt fellow my self,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94128:11"/>
I did wish with all my heart, (led thereunto by (that that rules the world) Interest,) that some good body would take them to do; and so effectually humble them, that a home-spun Countrey-grey and Friez-coat (though it be not a French-coat, nor bedaub'd with Lace) (and is sometimes worn out, or sold in <hi>Long-lane,</hi> before it be paid for;) might pass the streets quietly by them without a scoff or huff.</p>
            <p>But though they were mute, the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man went on that spoke last and so well of the <hi>Plaister,</hi> that prov'd not big enough to <hi>salve</hi> the Kings honour and Innocence, if the wounds had been as truly as maliciously given him; nor can in the least salve this <hi>Authors</hi> honour and Innocence if ever he had any. Nor can keep him undetected, or protect him from the stroak of Justice, and the smitings of his own conscience; if he keeps any awake, for any other end but to laugh at, and Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istically to jear at.</p>
            <p>And as his own Tongue has given it self the lye in reference to King <hi>Charles</hi> I. so as pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pably and plainly does it the same in relation to the account he gives of Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud.</hi>

            <p>For, <hi>like as</hi> when a churlish Mastiff wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries a strange Curr and tumbles him in the dirt, every dogged little Curr will have a snap at him when he is down, <hi>so</hi> this old Gentleman that not long ago had with the

same mouth cryed up this strange new Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, convinc'd now of his former folly, shows the truth of his conversion by his zeal; and since the Company generally did now cry him down, the old Gentleman had scarce patience thus long to forbear him; and because that, wanting teeth, he could not bite him, yet as well as he could, the old Cur <hi>mouths him</hi> with a <hi>Proverb,</hi> Proverb against Proverb.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Proverb</hi> of this strange Author that thus provok'd him and stuck in his stomach, did lie in p. 294. of the book. It was <hi>Jack Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,</hi> Jack Gentleman.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Which,</hi> says this old Gentleman, is a <hi>mere lie</hi> of his <hi>own</hi> making: though <hi>the Author</hi> on't, for fear of detection and shame, dares not <hi>own</hi> his <hi>own</hi> Issue, but makes it <hi>filius populi,</hi> a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard, of I know not whose begetting, only say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>they tell me,</hi> they tell me<hi>—It was come they tell me to Jack Gentleman. They</hi> tell me? continued he; what <hi>they?</hi> I am sure if it was <hi>any body,</hi> but the <hi>Author</hi> himself, it was <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas Nemo.</hi> For no body knows the <hi>old</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs of those times better than my self; and indeed, (saith he) I confess there was, and yet is, a <hi>Proverb</hi> something <hi>like</hi> it, but this Author <hi>clips</hi> it, and then <hi>new coyns</hi> it, and would make it pass for <hi>Currant,</hi> with <hi>they tell me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Proverb,</hi> in those times was not <hi>Jack-Gentleman,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>For <hi>supply</hi> whereof <hi>upstart</hi> gets himself a <hi>French</hi> coat, a <hi>French</hi> wit, a <hi>French</hi> head, a <hi>French</hi> wigg, <hi>French</hi> legs, <hi>French</hi> cringes, <hi>French</hi> Tongue, and all other members about him (in apish and mimick imitation of the <hi>French) frenchefyed,</hi> thereby to be taken for a <hi>Gentleman;</hi> whence the Proverb, <hi>Jack would be a Gentleman if he could speak French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At <hi>which,</hi> so probably related by the old Gentleman, most of the company laughed heartily; and concluded that this <hi>new</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, designing in his whole book to promote again the <hi>good old Cause,</hi> which he calls <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Orthodoxy;</hi> and sometimes <hi>the cause too good;</hi> resolving right or wrong, to plead the Cause of the <hi>Non-Conformists,</hi> which since he has espous'd, he is not asham'd of; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore confesses p. 282. <hi>that if he can do the Non-Conformists no good, he is resolv'd to do them no harm;</hi> and we will believe him without swearing.</p>
            <p>To carry on <hi>this goodly</hi> design, he bespatters
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:94128:14"/>
the present Government, with unparallel'd malice endeavours to stain and blemish the late Kings whole Reign as deform'd, rails at Bishops and evil Councellors, dead and alive, justifies <hi>Schisme,</hi> (as shall shortly appear) cries up Indulgence, and liberty, <hi>Breda, Breda;</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, Reformation; and with bitter sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casmes and invective taunts, prosecutes the present <hi>Parliament,</hi> (Rallery being the most biting and insufferable Railing) and all this with as little fear as wit.</p>
            <p>Rather than not have a fling at the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and pinch it till it recant all, (especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Act for Uniformity,</hi> or <hi>any Act</hi> against the <hi>good old Cause and Non-Conformists)</hi> to twit it home, as wittily and effectually as he can; he, p. 110. confounds nature to create a <hi>Joque;</hi> turns the <hi>Parliament-men</hi> into a <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of women,</hi> on purpose to break a jeast upon them, which had otherwise missed them, viz. <hi>Superfoetation of Acts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And new-mints a word, <hi>Trinkle,</hi> trinkle <hi>the members;</hi> rather than his beggarly wit should have nothing currant. It would make a man sick, to see this little <hi>Tantalus</hi> catch and gape for a jeast and a little Rhetorick; And (alas!) it will not come.</p>
            <p>And at other times to see him make a Lyons face and grunt and groan to send forth a little wit, but it is <hi>right Presbyterian,</hi> it will not
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:94128:14"/>
come; for the man is as <hi>costive</hi> as one of the <hi>old Assembly</hi> of Divines; or <hi>Smec.</hi> or <hi>Tom Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by-low,</hi> who dy'd because he was so.</p>
            <p>And all this pother is for <hi>an old Cause</hi> that stinks above ground in the nostrils of every honest heart, both here and all the world over.</p>
            <p>Yet commend me to the men for one thing, they are as restless and indefatigable in their endeavours to promote it; (though so often baffled by God and man) that they still cease not to move every stone, bribe and flatter, threaten and frown, fight and rayl, cant and recant, pray and lye, preach and slander, sni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel and whine, exhort and blaspheme, in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, in private, in City and Countrey, in Churches, in Conventicles, with License, and without License, by your leave, and in spight of your teeth; As if old <hi>Knox</hi> himself was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain metempsuchos'd in every one of them.</p>
            <p>To this purpose, <hi>in this Authour,</hi> they assault the Church and State, with the old weapons new furbish'd; and to make you believe their <hi>old cause</hi> was <hi>good,</hi> they make the <hi>old</hi> Kings cause <hi>bad,</hi> and this bold man dares, in this juncture of affairs, with implacable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veteracy, prey upon the dead, not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to rest in the bed of Honour our graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and blessed King, <hi>Englands</hi> Martyr,</p>
            <p>That sacrific'd his own life, rather than to

live in infamy by betraying his people, the laws, and his own just rights. And, though we can scarce believe our own eyes when we see the matchless Impudence of this Authour thus to traduce him and his whole Reign; and the present Parliament with Taunts as bitter as bold: yet to make all this seem but a jeast, when he <hi>casts firebrands, arrows and death,</hi> like mad; he seems to say, <hi>Am not I in sport?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In an affected, but taking and fashionable Drolling way, insinuating into every mans humour to carry on the work; Cajoling the <hi>Rabble</hi> with liberty, Indulgence, <hi>Breda, Breda;</hi> Cajoling the <hi>Yeomen and Corporations</hi> with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest and <hi>Trade; and propriety,</hi> invaded with fears of <hi>Sibthorpianisme, Ceremonies, Arminia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme and Manwaring.</hi>

            <p>But I being suddenly call'd away, was no longer happy with the further discourse of this <hi>Cabal</hi> of wits; only I took notice before I parted, that the <hi>Virtuoso's</hi> all this while made not one <hi>Repartee;</hi> or if they did, it was but

            <p>But with such a paltry and surly grace, that I could scarce contain my self; and I had much ado to forbear kicking the Coxcombs.</p>
            <p>And they had certainly felt the Print of my toes, but that I was not so angry as to hold from laughing right out, at such affected gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, they look'd so scurvily.</p>
            <l>With Head toss'd up, but bridling in the chin,</l>

            <p>And I think I have done very fair for my self; for all my fears forth with vanish'd. I took heart of grace, and found that all this pother made by our new Authour, was but right down rayling set off with a little Droll, the more takingly to calumniate and cast con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt on the Clergy, which he endeavours to wound, (through the sides of Mr. Bayes,) Bishop <hi>Bramhall,</hi> and Arch-Bishop <hi>Usher;</hi> and if his malice had gone no further than the Clergy, I had now left them to shift for themselves; for there is but few of them infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to <hi>Greg.</hi> in any thing but this his own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallel'd Rhetorick of Barking.</p>

But let the thing be what it will, the stroak's not so terrible as the crack.

            <p>For, (as <hi>Alvarez de Luna,</hi> chief Favourite to the King of <hi>Castile,</hi> us'd to say to those that admir'd his fortune; so say I of these men that are so scornful, secure and <hi>culminant)</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend not the <hi>Building till it be finish'd.

            <p>I grant there are such wise fools in the world, and so audacious, as, (like the old Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants) to bid Heaven Battle; casting dirt, and flinging stones at the stars; But he that sits in the heavens does but laugh them to scorn; and the stones fall usually on their own Pates.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Aquila non capit muscas,</hi> Greg. turns Tayl from the Ecclesiastical Politician, as a Prey too puny, and to shew the courage of his wickedness lets fly with indignation, at two most reverend and Learned Prelates of our age, Bishop <hi>Bramball,</hi> and Arch-Bishop <hi>Usher,</hi> Lord <hi>Primate</hi> and <hi>Metropolitan</hi> of all <hi>Ireland:</hi> (that <hi>was</hi> so once, I mean,) for (thanks to such as Greg. and his friends I.

stript of all but his Priesthood, (that indelible character) was glad to crouch and pray that he might be suffered <hi>in one of the Priests offices, that he might eat a piece of bread.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which Greg. calls p. 26. the <hi>height of the honest mans ambition, satisfying himself,</hi> (happy he that could, and holy he that would be so satisfied) <hi>with being admired by the white and blew Aprons, and poynted at by the more judicious Tankard-bearers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus Greg. adds scorn to the afflicted and affliction to his grief.

            <p>Besides, his necessities may possibly plead for him; for great Gamesters, (such as he makes himself p. 283. playing no less than Pieces at Picquet, and haunting the <hi>Ordinaries)</hi> are usually great losers: which unhappy chances if they fall out to be <hi>Gregories</hi> Lot, and blank him and bilk him, then <hi>sui profusus</hi> must be <hi>alieni appetens.</hi>

            <p>And of whose goods then can this Free-booter make a prize on more lawfully and with more justice, than upon the <hi>Churches Dignities?</hi> a Dignitory of <hi>Lincoln</hi> he tells us, p. 282. having cheated him already of his <hi>Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> and <hi>fingred</hi> his money. Is't not pity his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty does not give him a <hi>Letter of Mart,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imburse himself upon that people, by some of whom he was rob'd?</p>
            <p>Is not his Book a Prologue to his Revenge? foaming and raging against the people of God, (as proud <hi>Homan</hi> did,) and vowing their destruction and total extirpation of all the <hi>dignities</hi> in the Church, only for the affront of one <hi>Mordecai,</hi> alledging (as wicked <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>

            <p>For render but the <hi>Bishop's office</hi> useless, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially as to <hi>Episcopal Grandeur</hi> useless; (as indeed it is if there be no discipline, all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence;</p>

            <p>If a Gentleman has consumed his body, or wasted his estate, with gaming, riot, and wenching; would not it wonderfully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort his bowels, refresh, and chear up the man's drooping spirits and despair, To have all heal'd again with the Lands of the old Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, or Prebends, that ne'r knew how to lead a Dance, hand a Mistress, tread in a Masque, or pick the teeth with bonne Grace; nor so much as knew how to set the Periwig and Galloshoes, much less the true timing and accenting of a Rapper, and double swin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
            <p>And though these accomplishments, (not to be despised,) are worthy consideration, and may plead some merit; yet an Hospital, one would think, should be the height of such mens ambition, and if it were not for charity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake, more than their due.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:94128:23"/>
But if their merits were never so impulsive and supererogating, yet good men, like God, should hate robbery for an offering.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Levellers</hi> in the late times, set up their Standard at <hi>Burford-heath,</hi> and also e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected a <hi>Court of Chancery,</hi> (so called, for the <hi>Equity</hi> of its design,) inviting all Christian people to the Confederacy; for is there any equity or good Conscience, said they, that a Lord or Gentleman should have 5000, 10000, or 20000 pound <hi>per annum,</hi> when 20000 men have not so many pence? <hi>Oliver</hi> thereat took so hot an Alarm, that he never did ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more or better bestir himself, saying, If these men be suffered, there will be no living by them, either for Gentlemen, yeomen or tradesmen: But it is written, <hi>thou shalt not steal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the dumb beast opened his mouth, saying, <hi>Am not I thine Ass?</hi> He did thereby in right and good reason stop the mouths of all those that should gape after the goods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Prophet, though a wicked one:</p>
            <p>And this Ass shall serve to reprove the madness of this <hi>Father-grey-beard,</hi> who p. 309. by trampling on the fathers of the Church, and rendring them useless, as wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonizing away their time and opportunities to do good; and as Tyrants, chastising them

for <hi>their worthy cares,</hi> and afterwards striking at those of them that are privy Councellors, with unparallel'd pertness and daring, would thereby render them uncapable of, and unfit for their great places and revenues.</p>
            <p>And all this in so palpable and signal a manner, that every vulgar eye may readily see through his design, and guess at the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, if his Book had come out in 1642, as it does in 1672. Yet the Government being so well setled, it is evident he labours in vain, and <hi>Balaam</hi>'s Ass may silence him, these Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Revenues (belonging to those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets) are their own.</p>

            <p>Indeed it is as needless as difficult for one of my quality to pass a judgment upon the merit and worth of the present fathers of the Church; and much more insignificant is any Testimonial of mine to vouch them.</p>
            <p>Yet in despight of <hi>Father Grey-beard</hi> or Envy it self, and as far from flattery, we must say, that there are none, that are honess sons of the Church and legitimate, that have any cause to be asham'd of the present Fathers of the church of England, which</p>

            <p>But granting (what <hi>Greg.</hi> endeavours should be taken for granted) that some of the Fathers of the Church were good for nothing but to <hi>fill</hi> and <hi>keep the Bag,</hi> must all the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles be decry'd for one <hi>Judas?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay granting that all the Lords <hi>spiritual</hi> minded nothing but wickedness, yet they have as good right to their Estates as any wicked <hi>temporal</hi> Lord of the laity, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Gentleman can have to his.</p>

            <p>And if he do not look well to his hits, it is more than an even lay, that I shall beat him out of his play, before I have done. Yet I would have had more wit in mine anger, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd

            <p>I cannot but here take notice how he again abuses himself, by contemning by name, <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celot Andrews</hi> late Lord Bishop of <hi>Winchester;</hi> one that never produced any thing mishapen or deform'd; but all so lovely, and with ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral liking and applause admired; that Greg. by dispraising any thing that was his Issue, does but betray his own judgment, blinded with folly or implacable malice against all the <hi>Clergy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To <hi>whom</hi> he confesses p. 283. he bears a great grudge, ever since he was nuzled by one of their Coat; as if it was such a <hi>marvel, Jonye</hi> should be chous'd, when he comes to Commence Gentleman and Gallant, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made Free of the Company, with his pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et full of pieces at an <hi>Ordinary.</hi>

            <p>From <hi>which</hi> if he had abstain'd and kept still in his Chamber, <hi>himself and his Book</hi> (writ it seems in revenge of his great loss) he had been a wiser man, and richer too, by saving his Pieces and his Credit, which (if not quite lost) is at desperate hazard, and at the last stake.</p>

            </p>
            <p>So that Polemical Divinity, modern Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxy, the abatement of Episcopal Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, and primitive Simplicity, are, (if not terms aequivalent, yet all put together,) the great undertakings of this <hi>Primate,</hi> after <hi>he was past the sucking-bottle, and had so much strength and agility as to leap over a straw.</hi>

            <p>Why? But does the Devil drive men to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Orthodoxy? I beg your pardon Sir, if I mistake a little, nevertheless it puts me in mind of <hi>the Indenture</hi> made at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>

            <p>I know not how deep-learn'd Mr. <hi>Gregory</hi> is in <hi>modern Orthodoxy,</hi> yet I durst lay my Spectacles, he never read of a King standing <hi>on the stool of Repentance,</hi> in the <hi>Primitive Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity:</hi> in the old Records whereof I have seen <hi>Lawn sleeves, Rochet, square Cap,</hi> and <hi>Cassock</hi> writ in as fair and legible a hand, as Coat in <hi>Querpo, Black cap white fac'd,</hi> Breech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and Doublet, Stockings and Hat, Band and Cuffs, <hi>Cabala,</hi> Luggs flappant, Hour-glass, Pulpit, blew and white aprons, Simars, Peruke, or <hi>new-fashion'd Cloak.</hi>

            <p>For this same Cloak, that is so talk'd on, (which some Greek Copies read <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Did not some lie and say they had no sin? as did the <hi>Adamites, Pelagians</hi> and <hi>Donatists. (Aug. Cont. Petil. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 14. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 19.) and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the <hi>Carpocratians. (Iren. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 24.)</p>
            <p>Who taught them to cry up the Pulpit, and Sermons only, and decry Sacraments and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and Charity, but the <hi>Eutichites? (Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret.)</hi> Did they not deny Infant Baptism, and some the Baptism of those Infants whose Parents would not be examin'd by the lay-Elders, nor take the Covenant, (I mean) such as were not of their fraternity and Gang, as did the <hi>Heraclians, Henricians,</hi> and <hi>Pelagians.

            </p>
            <p>Did they not declare that private men have Authority to order and reform the Church, call Assemblies and Councels, and need not tarry for the Prince and Magistrate? as did the <hi>Monetarians.

            <p>Did they not declare it unlawful for the

Magistrate to punish hainous offences with Death, or to go to War whether offensive or defensive? as did the <hi>Manichees. (Aug. cont. Manich. l.</hi> 22. <hi>c.</hi> 74.) Did they not declare that no man has proprietary in Goods, Lands or Wife, but all should lie common, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Inclosure? as did the <hi>Pelagians</hi> and <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicks. (Magd. Eccles. Hist. Cent.</hi> 5. <hi>fol.</hi> 586.) and the <hi>Manichees. (Aug. de mor. Eccl. Cath. l.</hi> 1.)</p>
            <p>Would they afford either an Alms or Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or so much as a good word or look to any but their own Sect and Faction? so nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would the <hi>Manichees. (Aug. de mor. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nich. l.</hi> 2.) Were they not pure in their own eyes, but abominated as Dogs all but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and their friends? (so called in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to all others) as did the <hi>Pharisees.</hi> (Luk. 18. 11. Is. 65. 5. Prov. 30. 12, 13) And the <hi>Donatists. (Optat. de schism.

            <p>Did they not count it unlawful to swear, though in truth, in righteousness, and in judgment? As did the <hi>Essenes,</hi> the Jewish Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans. <hi>(Philo Judaeus.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus old Heresies (long ago condemned and dead and buried) by the Indulgence of our late licentious times, have found an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Resurrection.</p>
            <p>And cannot these evil spirits be bound down again to the infernal Pit, from whence
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:94128:31"/>
they came to deceive the Nations, as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they were by the wisdome of our Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, when Hell broke lose?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Simon Magus</hi> and his followers the <hi>Gnosticks</hi> (which in English signifies, <hi>the People of light)</hi> as they proudly enough call'd themselves) came at last, from one errour to another, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differenter utendi foeminis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And do not our <hi>Gnosticks</hi> that pretend to all <hi>the light,</hi> fall away from one delusion and <hi>Enthusiasme</hi> to another, till they come to be <hi>Ranters, Atheists,</hi> and what not?</p>
            <p>Is there no eye to pity these, nor house of Correction to be found? words are lost upon them, they are possest and prepossest.</p>
            <p>We, we have liv'd to see that all this noise for the Gospel, Reformation, modern Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxy, liberty, primitive simplicity, and abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Episcopal Grandeur, does but bluster on purpose to blow down Church and State, upon pretence to new-build them better and more fashionable after the <hi>Geneva-</hi>frame.</p>
            <p>Thus the Kite flies up to Heaven, but her design and eye is upon the Prey, and, but that the Buzzards (like thieves) fell out amongst themselves, true men had not so soon come to their own. But his Majestic promis'd In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence I am sure (saith Father Grey-beard) in his Declaration from <hi>Breda.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let honour for ever wait on his Majestic
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:94128:32"/>
and his Royal word; but know, that the best, honestest and most learned <hi>Casuists</hi> will tell us, that if Thieves and Robbers take a mans purse and rob his house, and not herewith satisfied, but they threaten also to kill him and every mothers son there, if the honest man do not promise and vow, nay swear, to give them more; yet when he's got out of their clutches he's also free of his oath.</p>
            <p>In the name of God what would this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple be at? Is't not enough that they got his sacred Majesties Father, and all his loyal friends, body and goods, that they could get into their clutches, and have they not done unto them whatsoever they would?</p>
            <p>Is't not enough that they rob'd him of his Kingdomes and drive him to straits, that he had not where to lay his head?</p>
            <p>And have they not cause to bless God and the King every day they rise, that they are not hang'd, drawn and quarter'd, as was <hi>Baanah</hi> and <hi>Rechab?</hi> But must they capitulate? set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down a stool of Repentance for him to sit on whilst they expostulate the matter.</p>
            <p>Oh but Indulgence, and Liberty, liberty of Conscience!</p>
            <p>By liberty of conscience must be meant ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a liberty to do what we should do, or a liberty to do what we would do. If they mean a liberty to do what they should do, spur on,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:94128:32"/>
up and be doing, in the name of God. The Reins of Government will neither check nor curb you; <hi>take my yoak upon you and learn of me,</hi> (saith our blessed Saviour) <hi>for I am meek and lowly,</hi> and <hi>came not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That's it (saith <hi>Greg.)</hi> the Non-conformists would be at, they desire only liberty to do the will of God, not their own wills; and to worship God in his own way, in Gods own way, though it be not the Kings high-way.</p>
            <p>But what if the Kings High-way be not out of Gods way, will you be so wretchedly unsociable and singular, as to separate and go out of the way, when it is the Kings High-way? The truth is, I have no great skill in Divinity, (my Education not designing me that way) yet as the times are, in a mans own defence of his Christianity (for to be sure now if he walk but out as far as a Club or a Coffee-house he shall be sure to be assaulted on that side) so much Divinity to defend it always in readiness, becomes as necessary for a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, as the <hi>little Tool behind</hi> to save reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and much more honourable; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any great accoutrement, I may soon have Divinity enough, to try it out with <hi>Father Grey-beard,</hi> I. O. and the rest of his friends; and can easily prove that the worship of God, so much prated of, and contain'd in the first Table, the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:94128:33"/>
four first Commandments, is in order, and made for the very nonce, and for no other thing or end but that men might obey the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Table, and six last Commandments. Start not, for I'le prove it as clear as the Sun at Noon-day.</p>
            <p>And that though sometimes comparisons are odious, yet between Gods commandments, to weigh and compare which is the greater and which is the lesser, is of absolute necessity to every godly man, when Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments seem to justle for precedence, and strive for the place.</p>
            <p>As they often do: and no man can truly fear God and obey him as he ought, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands not these Laws of Honour, and rules of Precedency.</p>
            <p>We cannot err when our Saviour is the guide and leads us the way: I'le instance in a few cases for example.</p>
            <p>The Pharisees of old, (just like our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Pharisees in their modern Orthodoxy) were <hi>marvellous men</hi> for the worship of God, and Gods day of worship, the Sabbath-day, Oh <hi>the Sabbath-day!</hi> and then for prayers, long, long prayers, sacrifice, and indeed for all the worship of God prescribed in the four first commandments, <hi>who but they?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Good, very good thus far; who can other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise think but that these who are so much for
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:94128:33"/>
God, and his glorious worship, should be Gods own People, the <hi>Godly Party,</hi> and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God as much for them?</p>
            <p>Who dare check them, lest he seem there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to fight against God? Who dare speak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their ways, lest he seem to bid heaven battail, and speak against Gods ways?</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lawyers</hi> amongst them, who were the chief <hi>Preachers,</hi> took it wonderful hainously, that even our blessed Saviour himself should dare to reprove them; and when he made so bold as to do it, they took it as a very high affront, <hi>Thus saying thou reproachest</hi> us also; <hi>us also,</hi> and <hi>reproachest,</hi> (not <hi>reprovest,</hi> but <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachest us</hi> also; taking for granted that to <hi>reprove,</hi> was to <hi>reproach</hi> them.)</p>
            <p>Yet for all this, in the first Sermon our Saviour makes, he assures his Auditory, That <hi>except their righteousness exceed the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, they should in no wise enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What? Would not <hi>the worship of God in his own way</hi> bring them to God? No. Would not a zealous and holy keeping Gods holy day bring them to God? No. Would not the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cry'd up for the most pure and godly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty bring them to God? No. Would not prayers many and long, and good too; and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many Sermons, and full good and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox and saving Truths, bring them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>o
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:94128:34"/>
God? No, Yet our Saviour gives them his Testimonial, that they did not only preach well, but also nothing that was ill, <hi>(what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever they bid you observe, do.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to give those <hi>Pharisees</hi> their due, they did not only go Heaven-wards, but they did far over-go many of our <hi>Pharisees</hi> and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Heaven-ward.</p>
            <p>For the Pharisees sat in <hi>Moses</hi>'s chair, preached Truth, and nothing but the Truth, whereas, <hi>Bind your Kings with chains, and your Nobles with fetters of Iron, This honour have all the Saints—Curse ye Meroz,</hi> &amp;c. and many other good Truths, were miserably <hi>wrested</hi> (you know) by many, nay most of our godly Party, (that pretended above all others to <hi>fear God)</hi> on purpose to <hi>dishonour the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I lay not the stress upon that, but grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that any man preaches, and prays, keeps Gods holy day, and worships him, how di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely, truly and sincerely soever; yet <hi>all this</hi> exceeds not a <hi>Pharisee,</hi> nor shall ever bring him to the Kingdom of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name, and in thy name cast out Devils?</hi> Depart from me, saith our blessed Lord, <hi>I know you not;</hi> What? not know thine own Preachers, prophesying in thy name, and such as have prayed too, <hi>Lord, Lord?</hi> No. <hi>I know you not</hi> (saith he) why? <hi>Ye are workers of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:94128:34"/>
Workers of iniquity? Who are <hi>they?</hi> or rather who are <hi>not so?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In respect of the <hi>first</hi> Table, the four first commandments, the Pharisees (of all men living) were <hi>not so,</hi> workers of iniquity.</p>
            <p>And in respect of the four first command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, such as prayed and preach'd in Christs name, stood for the Lords worship, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently Gods times of worship, and the Lords-day, were (of all men living) the <hi>least</hi> workers of iniquity.</p>
            <p>Therefore since Christ knows not these, there is a greater thing than Gods worship awanting, and which is <hi>the one thing</hi> necessary, and whats <hi>That?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Saviour tells us, in the same Sermon, even to <hi>do to others, as we would they should do unto us,</hi> for this is the Law and the Prophets, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 12. That is to say, The summe and great design of the Law, and the preaching of the Prophets have all but this one scope and end, to prevail with mankind to keep the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Table, or six last commandments, which do more particularly direct us how to observe this great general rule, <hi>Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that as food and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ayment is for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the body, <hi>Preaching</hi> Gods holy word, <hi>Prayers,</hi> keeping <hi>days holy,</hi> and all the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:94128:35"/>
               <hi>worship</hi> of God whatsoever has but one main scope and end, even to make men <hi>good, good</hi> to our own bodies and souls by temperance and sobriety, <hi>good</hi> to others, by demeaning our selves peaceably, justly and mercifully one towards another, as we are particularly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected in the six last commandments.</p>
            <p>Which <hi>six last</hi> Commandments God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, our blessed Saviour, and the Prophets, and Apostles, do therefore <hi>prefer</hi> much <hi>above</hi> the first table, and <hi>four first</hi> Commandments; in <hi>so much</hi> as the <hi>end</hi> is more noble than the <hi>meanes</hi> to that end; as the <hi>life</hi> is <hi>more</hi> than <hi>meat,</hi> and the body than rayment; <hi>meat</hi> and <hi>rayment</hi> being but the <hi>meanes</hi> designed for that great <hi>end,</hi> namely the <hi>preservation of the body and life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore as he that clothes himself with rayment, how good &amp; warm soever it be, and presently throws it all off again; and he that eats, and eats, and eats, and either presently vomits it up again, or that the meat Lienteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally pass through him without alteration, and digestion, must needs be starved; so he that takes in never so much of spiritual food, and digests it not according to the great design and end for which God sent it, namely to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the six last Commandments, that is, to be good to himself and others, he must needs have a ruin'd and starv'd soul. The
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:94128:35"/>
Doctrine (how wholesome soever) being worthless for want of the use: and these great Sermon-mongers are at best but the great-eaters, the spiritual <hi>Maynards,</hi> and <hi>Wood</hi> of <hi>Kent,</hi> Mr. <hi>C.</hi> of <hi>Norwich, W. B.</hi> of <hi>Yarmouth.</hi> For can all our <hi>worship</hi> of God, <hi>prayers, praises,</hi> and <hi>preachings, observing Lords-days</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments</hi> profit God? Is he the better for them? <hi>Job</hi> 35. 7. 8. <hi>If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thy hand? Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art, and thy righteousness may profit the son of man:</hi> but cannot profit God.</p>
            <p>Therefore when Almighty God first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgated his sacred Laws, he tells his people wherefore he ordered them to keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, <hi>Deut</hi> 10. 13. even for <hi>their</hi> good, not his own.</p>
            <p>And excellently does his Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> tells us to this purpose, the great duty of man, Micah 6. 6, 7, 8. <hi>Wherewith shall I come before the Lord, and how my self before the high God? Shall I come before him with burnt-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>fferings?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when the Pharisees (that prided themselves so much in looking so carefully af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Gods worship and Gods day) were offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:94128:36"/>
so highly with the liberty which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and his disciples took to themselves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Sabbath-day,</hi> in not keeping it so strictly, as these <hi>Hypocritical Puritans</hi> deemed they ought to have done; our Saviour tells them of a superiour Law and of far greater concernment than the four first Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments put together, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 7. and that was the Law of charity and <hi>mercy,</hi> which <hi>if the Pharisees had understood, they would not have condemned the guiltless.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Even God himself dispenses with his own Law for worship, in the old Law, when mercy and charity plead against it; for sacrifices and offerings were then part of Gods worship, which were very chargeable; therefore for <hi>mercys</hi> sake and <hi>charitys</hi> sake, at the Purifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereas the woman by Law ought to offer a Lamb for her cleansing, yet if she was a <hi>poor</hi> woman, and not of ability, Almighty God abates of his due, and is content with what, without any great charge or trouble, she might easily get in that Country, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, two <hi>Turtles,</hi> or two young <hi>Pigeons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that the Question is not so much which are Gods Commandments, as which are the greatest Commandments, and best deserve preferment; not the <hi>first</hi> Table, but the <hi>second;</hi> for to do justice and judgement is <hi>more</hi> accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the Lord than sacrifice, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21. 3.
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:94128:36"/>
and to obey, is <hi>better</hi> than sacrifice, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 22.</p>
            <p>Therefore we must conclude, That though the worship of God be <hi>good,</hi> yet to do good and communicate good to others is <hi>better;</hi> though to observe the <hi>four first</hi> Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be good, yet to observe the <hi>six latter</hi> is better; Though faith in God be good, yet charity to our selves and others is better, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 13. and all faith and worship with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this charity is not worth a pin, nay is just <hi>nothing</hi> at all, though a man preach like an Angel, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 1, 2.</p>
            <p>This being granted for a great Truth, and which all the whining Tribe, though they lay all their heads together, are not able to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove or gainsay, may <hi>silence</hi> the Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists Prayers, and stop their mouths more than St. <hi>Bartholomew</hi> yet has done.</p>
            <p>For though to meet together to pray and preach, and worship God according to the four first Commandments be good; yet to obey the Commands of a Christian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, and submit to his Laws according to the first Commandment in the second Table is better; and ought to be preferr'd by every truly Conscienc'd Christian; and in so doing he is safe in that submission and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>Whether it be right in the sight of God to</hi>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:94128:37"/>
               <hi>hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye,</hi> saith St. <hi>Peter,</hi> Acts 4. 19. <hi>For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Text has been damnably abused, and as the same Apostle says of other Texts of Scripture in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles, wrested, put upon the rack, (as the word signifies) and made to speak what it never thought; and will never justifie our <hi>Non-Conformists</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before God or man in the least. To whom does the blessed Apostle speak? <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 5, 6. to the <hi>Rulers, and Elders, and Scribes, and Annas the High-Priest, and Caia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas,</hi> &amp;c. who condemn'd our Lord Jesus to be crucified, and if they might have had their wills, would have been the death of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity with him.</p>
            <p>And is his Sacred Majesty, and his two Houses of Parliament no better in your esteem than <hi>Annas,</hi> and <hi>Caiaphas;</hi> they are mightily beholden to you for your good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of them.</p>
            <p>And if that be not your opinion, that Text is nothing to your case, nor to the purpose: but point-blank against you.</p>
            <p>For whether it be right to hearken unto God, judge ye. God had never given Laws for his own worship to mankind, but for the good, peace and welfare of mankind: God had never made the first Table of the Law,

but in order to, and for the better observance of the duties of the second Table: If Subjects would never have been disobedient to their Prince and Governours, nor children dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient to their Parents, nor servants to their Masters; if men would never have coveted their neighbours goods, nor their neighbours wife, nor servant, nor have rob'd, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered one another, but would have liv'd so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly, righteously, and therefore godlily in this present world, the <hi>Allelujahs</hi> of Angels had been the great worship of men: But since it is otherwise, and that the wickedness of man is great in the earth, and the imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the thoughts of his heart so bent to evil, and that continually, therefore God establish'd his Laws, in the first Table by worship, sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Typically, in the Old Testament, for expiation of the guilt of sin, and justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; and sent his Son, who was made a sacrifice for us antitypically in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament for expiation of the guilt of sin and justification, as our Priest; and to show us how to live well, as our Prophet; and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act our obedience, as our King.</p>
            <p>But none are benefited by his Priestly Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, but such as obey his princely Laws, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Prophetical Injunctions: none are justified, but such as are sanctified; for this is the great will of God, our sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

Our Sanctification therefore is the grand design of the Law and Gospel, Prophets and Apostles, and that sanctification being sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily concluded by our Saviour, <hi>in doing as we would be done by;</hi> and all lesser holy duties of prayer, praising, hearing, Sacraments, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in order to the <hi>great</hi> holy duty of doing as we would be done by, and particularized in, and reducible to, the second Table, prove in all cases of conscience, the truly godly must do the greater duty rather than the less, and the duties of the second Table rather than the first, so that he do but continue his faith in Christ the while, and in so doing.</p>

            <p>In obeying, and submitting in quietness to the supream and Christian powers, you obey God, and that obedience is better than sacrifice; and proves evidently, that that which <hi>Greg.</hi> sets down, p. 100. for <hi>Apochrypha</hi> in the <hi>Ecclesiastical Politician,</hi> is an undoubted truth,

            <p>In an unlawful and forbidden Conventicle, you may pray possibly to God, and preach of God, and hear Gods Word; this worship of it self good becomes evil &amp; a sin, because though doing a duty which is good and great, in it self, yet thereby transgressing a duty of the second Table, which is better and greater and of a higher concernment, your worship <hi>then and there</hi> is but as the <hi>cutting off of a Dogs-neck,</hi> and God will say, <hi>who hath required these things at your hands?</hi>

Nay put in their Preachers and all into a sack together, and the first that comes out shall have incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably more pride, malice, wrath, lying, slandering, and evil speaking, and rejoycing in iniquity (when they can hear of any faults or judgments with which any are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken that are not of their gang,) than any <hi>Turk, Jew,</hi> or <hi>Indian Man-eater</hi> that ever <hi>I converst with,</hi> and I have converst with thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands; and if these be the people of God, the Lord in his mercy deliver me from them, and the evil way they walk in by Companies, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning headlong to the bottom and end of that way, eternal destruction, and striving who
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:94128:46"/>
should first come there and run the fastest, (as if they were afraid they should not come at the Divel in good time.)</p>
            <p>Whereas my Religion, namely, this of my Saviour in <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 12. like the Sun in his full strength and light, carryes its own evidence and speaks sufficiently for it self, leading men into unerring paths, bringing quietness and peace and light to mankind; nor can any man walk in darkness or do any thing of the works of darkness that walks by this rule, but peace must be upon them, as upon the only true Israel of God; no canting, no hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, no feigned words needs here; but Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness and Peace embrace each other, both here and to Eternity.</p>
            <p>In which Religion I doubt not by Gods grace to continue all the dayes of my life; for of all the Idols of the Heathens, there is but one true God, and of all Religions, there is but one true one, one Christ, one way, one truth, one life, one light; and this is it.</p>
            <p>Would God, think you, leave men a way to Heaven, revealed by his Son, if it were not to be found without a great many <hi>Fathers,</hi> decrees of <hi>Councils, Glosses, Homilies, Sermons,</hi> infinite, and as large and of as little purpose the most of them as the writings of Mr. <hi>Prin?</hi> Whereas this way of Christ is soon found, soon got my heart, easily remembred, readily
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:94128:47"/>
applyed. And if no other Text had been preacht upon this 30 years, and practised, <hi>England</hi> had seen no warrs nor bloodshed, ruine nor rapine, murder and rebellion, that had almost quite destroyed us; neither had the war been carryed on with a few canting words, and misapplyed scriptures, prating and praying, seeking of God as <hi>Cromwel</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it, when he went to prayer with the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Army, to seek God and know his mind, whether he should murder the King or no, whereas he had resolv'd it long before; like <hi>Jezabel,</hi> seeking God by prayer and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, when the bottom and design of all is nothing but rapine and covetousness to take <hi>Naboth's life,</hi> that thereby she might get the better footing in <hi>Naboth's vineyard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if this little Rule be practis'd, down goes <hi>Diana</hi> of the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> and the Idols, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and imaginations of the heart of man.</p>
            <p>No man could steal nor covet, nor be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, nor disobedient to his superiors, if he keep to this Rule; Why? because he would be loth to be so serv'd himself; loth men should take away his goods, his servant, his daughter, his wife, or his lands, or good name. No man would be a rebel or disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to his superiors that is of this Religion; Why? because he would not endure that his servants, his children and family should be
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:94128:47"/>
disobedient unto him; there would be no liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, no keeping house with them, if they did not obey; for if he command one son, in seed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, to go plow, and another to sow, and his son or servant say nay, but it is better to thrash, or fan, and more needful; this disobedience will make them all smart for it in a little time; a house thus divided cannot stand long,</p>
            <p>Nay, in spiritual things, the master of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily calling his servants &amp; children to prayers in the morning, at noon, or night, he will not permit a servant or a child to be hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and playing abroad, whilst he is praying, nor to lie lolling upon a couch or chair, laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and jearing with his hat on, whilst he is praying and kneeling, or singing of Psalms; there is not a Phanatick in <hi>England</hi> will suffer this, but will reprove, rebuke, exhort and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stise such a jearing, irreverent son or servant, &amp;, thinks God requires it at his hands, and would send judgements upon him, and his family, with a grievous curse, if when his sons are vile, he restrain them not; (though they tell him it is their conscience to be vile, and irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.) And tell them moreover how God punish'd old <hi>Eli,</hi> for neglecting to restrain his sons, let them pretend what conscience they will, he will likewise have the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his own conscience, which tells him, if it be their conscience to be thus disorderly, vile,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:94128:48"/>
irreverent, and disobedient, it is also his conscience to restrain their vileness, irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and disobedience: and will further ask them, if they were in his condition, and were masters of a family, whether they would be content that their servants and sons should do what they list, and what was right in their own eyes, and whether it is possible a house so divided can stand long This eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Phanatick in <hi>England</hi> pleads to his family, and brings the fifth Commandment to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm and warrant all that he saith to them; adding that it is the first Commandment with promise, (as the Apostle calls it,) that is with promise of present reward in this life, even length of days; whereas men by disobedience to their natural fathers, or spiritual or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral fathers in Church or State shorten their lives, as the rebels <hi>Baanah,</hi> and <hi>Rechab, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitophel, Absalom, Sheba</hi> and the rest of them in all ages.</p>
            <p>Now apply this that I have said; examine thine own heart, call it to account seriously before thou come before Gods Tribunal to receive thine eternal Doom when it is too late to amend, and try in any particular where thou disobeyest thy superiours in Church or State, whether thou wouldst suffer such dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience in thine own family.</p>
            <p>First as to Ceremonies, which are but the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:94128:48"/>
outskirts, the suburbs of true Religion, (this one true Religion I am speaking of) yet it is a sign that thou art an enemy to the City of God and holy hill of <hi>Sion,</hi> if thou burn, plunder or pull down the Suburbs; not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Suburbs are the City; or Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of true Religion, the true Religion it self, and Gods holy <hi>Sion;</hi> but yet the Governours in the City will watch over thee, punish thee and keep thee off, because thou art an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the holy City, to the true Religion, or else thou wouldst not have overturned and trampled upon the Suburbs.</p>
            <p>If you understand this, you have the true notion and understanding of a Ceremony; if you do not, I will not further explain my self.</p>
            <p>Wilt thou not suffer thy child to loll and jear with his hat on, whilest thou art praying and kneeling with thy hat off, though he pretend conscience for his disobedience; and wilt thou not kneel then, when they bid thee kneel, that are thy Superiours in Church and State? and be uncoverd, when they bid thee be uncovered? Hast thou power to enjoin Ceremonies in thy family? and have not thy Superiours as much power to ordain Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies in the Church? Dost thou that plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est the fifth Commandement against thy wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed disobedient son &amp; servant, never plead it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:94128:49"/>
thy self? Dost thou say to thy son and servant, <hi>you must needs be subject and that for conscience sake?</hi> and dost thou never send that Scripture home to thine own heart? thou that sayst a man should not steal, or be diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient; dost thou steal? art thou disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient?</p>
            <p>What need of Jayls or Acts of Indemnity or Uniformity, Licences or Liberty, Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence or no Indulgence? It is all one to him that is of this Religion; which will not suffer a man to pray and lye, slander and preach, fast and murder, talk of incomes and getting Christ whilest he goes the way to hell. There can be no Rebel-Saints of this Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p>I'll tell you in one word how truly to get Christ, whilest Canters belabour you with a sound and an empty noise.</p>
            <p>To get Christ, is to get to Christ; and there is no getting to Christ, but in his own way; his own way is what he taught him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for the sum of all Religion, Law and Prophets, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 12. which we have been treating of, which is ready at hand, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to direct thee in thought, word and deed, believe the Creed, say the Lords prayer, and the Liturgy, frequent Sacraments, and this is religion enough to carry thee to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:94128:49"/>
But you'll say perhaps, and object against me, that if this be my religion, why do I not practise it? and again ask me whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this Letter I have done to others as I would they should do to me; that is, would I be willing to be so sharply reprov'd and check'd, as I sometimes check <hi>Father Grey-beard,</hi> and the Canters.</p>
            <p>To which I answer, I not only would be content to be so us'd, but if I were such a wretch to trouble and confound the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom where I live, with arts and methods that do tend, and (as by sad experience we have found) have tended to blood, ruine, wars and desolation;</p>
            <p>I would esteem him the best friend that I had in the world that could either convince me, and the people seduced by me of our villanies; or laugh me and them out of such fopperies, by representing me and them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the stage in as ridiculous a posture if it were possible as ever they were acted by me or them, or <hi>Hugh Peters</hi> himself, when multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of poor fools strove who should first part with their silver-bodkins and Plate, body and soul for the <hi>Good O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>d Cause.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if it were not to do both the seducers and seduced good by this plain dealing, I had not writ a word in this Letter; for I know my reward from most of them is that
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:94128:50"/>
hatred for my good will, railing, lying, and slandering me as the worst of men; and yet cannot evidence in one particluar, where I have transgress'd this great rule of <hi>doing as I would be done by,</hi> this ten years.</p>
            <p>Which I speak not as a fool or a Pharisee to boast of; for fame, nor honour, nor dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour, riches, nor poverty, good report, nor evil report, safety or hazard, can seem to me, or any that are well grounded in this religion of Christ, (of doing as we would be done by,) any thing to move me towards the least desire of applause; for I know this justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of my self is the way to create great envy, and great reproach against me, in those that know no duty so great as the four first Commandements; namely, the worship of God, his days, Sermons, mysteries, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses and disputes of their ways of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; they are full of that, but yet can envy, lye, slander and rail; and then I tell them, (but they believe not,) that all their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hearing, keeping Sabbaths, are not worth a Louse, nor their faith neither; though it is the very words, at least the sence of what they read with their eyes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 2. only here's the difference, I speak more worthily of their prophesying, and their faith, than the Apostle does allow to such i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle mysteries, where charity is wanting, for
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:94128:50"/>
he says, such a man as has the gift of prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sying, understands all mysteries, all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, has all faith, without charity is <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:</hi> whereas I only say, such a man's gifts, knowledge, mysteries and faith are not, without charity, <hi>worth a Louse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that I have therein out-bid the worth of them, a Louse is good for something, (I will not tell all its vertues) it is good for the Jaundice, &amp;c. but all knowledge, mysteries, prophesying, and faith, without charity, the Apostle makes good for <hi>nothing</hi> at all.</p>
            <p>Away with mens prate of Religion, and admiring this and that precious man, this and that precious piece of worship, when it only puffs men up, makes them more proud, more scornful, more headstrong, more cruel, more bloody, more rapacious, greater lyers, greater slanderers, more malicious than they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and more a Devil, than any man in the world is, <hi>Turk, Jew</hi> or <hi>Cannibal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shew me not the meat, but shew me the man; if these people that prate of their precious heavenly food they have had in these late times, have in the mean time such starv'd souls, empty of all goodness, (but a little outside holiness and vizard of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,) but are full of such horrid sins, as envy, malice, injustice, lying, cheating, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faming, and sometimes murdering and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:94128:51"/>
and sequestring; that on this side Hell there's no such treacherous, false and unso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciable villaines; then by this it is evident, that like <hi>Ephraim,</hi> they sed upon the wind, liv'd like <hi>Camelions</hi> upon air, sound, whine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, canting, feigned words; and if perhaps they have cast out some one Devil of swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Sabbath-breaking, they have enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the room seven other Devils more wicked than the former, and the last state of that man is worse than the first.</p>
            <p>I know with this plain dealing, I stir in a nest of wasps, and because I have cryed down these feigned words, (with which craft these silver-smiths and juglers get their wealth,) these dearly beloved tones and whinings, that did so affect the silly women, thus undervalued, spoils the trade: G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>e me pen and ink and paper, will the juglers say, this must not be suffered, we must use some course speedily to blacken, I say blacken the author, and impair the value of his Letter, or our trade is gone.</p>
            <p>Join your forces, up and be doing, truth is strongest; ye fight against your <hi>Saviour,</hi> S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> if you quarrel me for this; come meddle then if you dare.</p>
            <p>And if you do provoke me, I will not only spoil the sale and market of your new-coin'd
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:94128:51"/>
feigned words; but I'll cry down your mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-day too, on which you sell your empty sounds to fill your pockets.</p>
            <p>Not that I am against preaching up chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and goodness; and faith and hope too in order unto charity, and upon the Lords day too, if so be that preaching, praying, or worship, hearing, or faith doth not hinder better duties, <hi>viz.</hi> works of mercy, mercy to my own body, to my beast, to my family, to my neighbour.</p>
            <p>But if keeping any day of worship, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming any duties of worship hinder any of those greater duties; then I sin in doing those duties of worship, which hinder those great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er duties of mercy.</p>
            <p>Yet I say if I can do both, (both wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship God and keep a holy day to him, and also perform the greater duties of mercy,) then both is better;</p>
            <p>God has join'd them together, let not man put them asunder; faith is a good grace, and hope is good, and charity good; and preaching, and prophesying, knowledge and mysteries are all good, it is a pity they should be parted; but if we want charity, we want the great accomplishment, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of these is charity.</p>
            <p>And if any body think that I herein speak too slightly of keeping the Lords day, let

them know, that if they think so, they do but censure amiss, and like the Hypocrites and Pharisees condemn me for that, that was the very cause why our Saviour himself was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a sinner; as you may see <hi>Jo.</hi> 9. 14. 16. 24. The Sabbath day, and all other days were made, as all things else, and as all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments were made, <hi>viz.</hi> only for the good of man, not for his hurt and dammage, (if you will believe our Saviour.) The Sabbath was made for man and not man for the Sabbath.</p>
            <p>If my neighbours house be on fire, as I am going to Church, I ought to get my buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et and throw water and help to quench it, for all going to a Sermon; and God likes me better, with my pail in my hand at that time, than the Bible in my hand, or a prayer in my mouth, when charity to my neighbour su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persedes my worship of God, as being su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour to it; as our Saviour tells the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees upon the like occasion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 9. I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, that is, not sacrifice when it hinders the greater duty of mercy.</p>
            <p>And if a flood be coming down, ready to flow my meadows, when my Hay had need be carried away with my cart, or else it will be carried away with the flood, I should sin at that time, if going to Church, or any
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:94128:54"/>
worship of God should prevent me from har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessing my horse and going to cart on the Lords day: and my servants should sin grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously with going to Church, when a work of mercy to my poor family and cattle called them another way.</p>
            <p>And though our modern Pharisees and Hypocrites will condemn me herein, yet they cannot tell how to confute it by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture nor reason; and if they had known the true Religion, or what this meaneth, I will have mercy and not sacrifice, they would not have condemned the guiltless.</p>
            <p>I might give many other instances, in making ready food in mercy to my body; I mean not only necessary food to keep life and soul togethet, as we vulgarly say, but such food as is most convenient, good hot victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, and good drink on the Lords day; for watering a man's Horse and Ass on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day is not necessary for life; they will live (as hunting horses often do) a longer time without water; but it is not convenient so to make them fast, and being a work of mercy, though but to your beast, therefore does not every one of you think it lawful to do this convenient good on the Sabbath day? That is, supposing the fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had the same force and efficacy, that other Ceremonies and Types had in our
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:94128:55"/>
Saviours time. But alas! the case is alter'd now; those types and shadows are now of no more force than Circumcision, and new Moons; which in respect of Gospel disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries are but weak and beggarly elements; whereunto our modern Pharisees desire again to be in bondage, and lest the hope of their gain should be gone, they are wonderful zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for the morality of the Sabbath; and the morality of the fourth Commandment; that yet are the most unmannerly, sawcy, perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptory people under the Heavens; endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to shew morality no where but in their market-day, where they get much gain with as light frothy ware, as ever was sold; poor people are cheated and have a hard penny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth of it, as ever men had, if they give a penny for these fictitious words, such as this, the <hi>ten moral</hi> Commandments, and the <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality</hi> of the <hi>fourth Commandment;</hi> which all the art they have can never prove; nor that there is since Christs death, any more intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secal holiness in one day than another; nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more holiness in the Lords day, than any other Holy-day, mentioned in the Act of Parliament for that purpose; wherein are these words,—These days shall be kept holy, namely, every Sunday in the year, then follow all the Saints days, and holy days, to which the King and Parliament may adde
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:94128:55"/>
more holy-days if they please; and as they have done; and as they are of humane insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, can also take away some if they judge convenient.</p>
            <p>Nor ought any man to keep the Lord's day, in conscience or duty, more than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Holy-day.</p>
            <p>And the ground of a man's keeping the Lords-day and all other Holy-days, is in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the fifth Commandment, not the fourth Commandment.</p>
            <p>Which if it were moral, <hi>i. e.</hi> perpetual in their sence, it is not in the power of the Church, nor King nor Parliament to alter the day from the seventh to the first; but all Sabbath days were like the new-moons, and other Jewish festivals, mere shadows of things to come, but the body is Christ; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come, the shadows vanish.</p>
            <p>And those that zealously affect men with this Jewish conceit, of keeping days, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do <hi>zèalously</hi> indeed <hi>affect men, but not well;</hi> nor honestly.</p>
            <p>I know men are apt enough to take liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to themselves in this licentious age to any prophaness; but I deny that it is prophaness for me to dress convenient food for my self and family, hot and good if I can get it, on the Lords-day; and <hi>Greg.</hi> does acknowledge himself and all that he knows of his party to
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:94128:56"/>
be of this opinion herein; in this one thing then we do agree; and this is the first par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular we have concurr'd in, since we met.</p>
            <p>Also I deny that it is unlawful for me, (but rather a duty incumbent upon me,) to give my servants lieve to play and recreate themselves with any honest sport, upon the Sunday, or any other Holy-day at convenient times; for I ought in mercy and charity, to be merciful to my beasts, my oxe or my ass, in watering them, which is not necessary, but only expedient for life;</p>
            <p>Much more ought I to be merciful to my poor Prentice, my servant, my Hand-maid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, that have drudg'd and trudg'd to slave and work for me on working days, when Sunday or any other Holy-day comes; if I be of Christs true Religion, and do as I would be done by.</p>
            <p>Nay, I ought, if I am able to let them drink better liquor, and eat better meat, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> speaks; and send portions thereof to the poor according to my ability, on those festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals; at least, give them, what I give my beast, ease and rest on those vacation-days; a penny-worth of ease is worth a penny. And the contrary opinion is hypocritical, pharisaical, hard-hearted, apocryphal and

prophane; and contrary to the great Law of charity and mercy; and contrary to those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible and unanswerable reasons rendred excellently in that proclamation for lawful sports on Sundays and all other Holy-days published by the Command, and well setled judgment of King <hi>James,</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> I. to that purpose.</p>
            <p>And agreeable with the opinion and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of all Christians, Nations and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms in the world, and even of <hi>Geneva</hi> it self; and contradicted by none but our senceless, hypocritical, modern orthodox Rebels, that write in this particular, after nobody but <hi>Knox,</hi> that grand Rebel and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novator.</p>
            <p>Oh but did not these fellows arm the rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble against the King and Bishops upon this very account?</p>
            <p>They did so, the more prophane wretches they, by laying a yoke upon the necks of the disciples, which God never imposed; through their own superstition; or rather perverse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            <p>Wheedling the silly rabble with pretence of Religion and Gods-day; which is not a day that the Lord has made, more than any other day; nor more holy, than so far forth, as the King and Parliament have made it, and set it apart for holy uses, as they have done
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:94128:57"/>
other Holy-days; namely, vacation-days from servile and worldly toil, that men might be now at leisure, for Gods worship, merciful and charitable works to our selves, our neighbours, our servants, our hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maidens, our Ox and our Ass, and the like, which are the proper duties for a Sunday and other holy-days.</p>
            <p>And because we are a trading, covetous, having, worldly minded people, if the King and Parliament think fit to allow us no other Holy-days but Sundays, and half a dozen more in a year, I am content. And the late wrethced Rebels might with more right and good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son have taken occasion to rebel, as <hi>Massin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>So consonant to the doctrine and practice of all Christendom, and so agreeable with the great Law, of doing as we would be done by.</p>
            <p>And there is never a one of these spleena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, peev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>sh, morose, unsociable, and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical Pharisees, but in their practice do as much contradict their own doctrine for
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:94128:57"/>
the Sabbath, as that so much talk'd of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation has done, every Sunday when they leave their maid at home, carefully to look to the pot and the spit; that all be ready piping hot precisely against the time, that Lungs comes home, when his Auditory is tyr'd perhaps more than himself.</p>
            <p>Binding heavy burdens, and grievous to be born, and laying them on other mens shoulders, but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers: and saying, as <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Leyden</hi> did, (upon the rack con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing the true cause of his Fanaticism and Impostures,) <hi>The people love to he cheated with Superstition, and love them h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>st, that gull them most.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus have I as briefly and as fast as my pen could write, given an honest and down-right account, why and how true Christians should keep a Sunday or other day holy, (though not according to the hypocritical and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern orthodox; but) consentaneous with all the truly Orthodox Christians in the world.</p>
            <p>And in answer to what <hi>Father Grey-beard</hi> in a different character sets down as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocryphal opinion of the Reverend Bishop <hi>Bramhall,</hi> but is an infallible truth, <hi>p.</hi> 38. namely, he maintains <hi>the publick Sports on the Lords day</hi> by the Proclamation to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:94128:58"/>
and the example of the Reformed Churches beyond Sea: and for the <hi>publick dances of our youth upon Countrey-Greens on Sundays after the duties of the day, he sees nothing in them but innocent and agreeable to that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-sort of people.</hi> And <hi>he takes the promiscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous License to unqualified persons to read the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, far more prejudicial, nay more perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, than the over-rigorous restraint of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists.</hi> And he took it well, in so taking it.</p>
            <p>For though no man can have a more sacred esteem and value for the holy Scripture and Gods word than I have; knowing that it is profitable for instruction, and to make the man of God perfect throughly furnished unto every good work,</p>
            <p>Yet this good work of instructing out of it properly belongs to the man of God, it is his province, not incumbent upon every man, nor possible to be undertaken by every man.</p>
            <p>Because our English Bibles are not in every particular the word of God; nor in any one thing the words of the Prophets, of Christ and the Apostles, who not one of them spoke English, except perhaps S. <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> and the modern Orthodox have no great kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for that Apostle, because of a certain Reason.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:94128:58"/>
But chiefly because neither he nor any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Apostle delivered the mind of God, and holy writ in the English tongue. The En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Bibles in the Translation at best being but a paraphrase, or Homily of the word of God; nor all that neither for these reasons that are unanswerable and infallible.</p>
            <p>First, because the English Bibles are in some places erroneous; Secondly, They are in some places scarce sence; and of dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences, when every pert, bold and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited fellow, (that only understands En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish) takes upon himself to raise doctrines and opinions thence, contrary to the sence and meaning of God in his holy word; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the mind and meaning of the Holy-Ghost, as well as contrary to the sence of the Church and truly Orthodox.</p>
            <p>I love not this discourse, and could wish it were any bodies task and employment ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than mine, it is so ungrateful and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally displeasing; yet since this bold <hi>Greg.</hi> has given the occasion by reflecting upon the honest words of the most Reverend and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Bishop <hi>Bramhall,</hi> in these odde animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions, in things far above his shallow pate, apprehension and reach;</p>
            <p>Therefore now my hand is in, though I could fill a Volume upon this excellent sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, so needful to be explain'd in these times,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:94128:59"/>
when people have run a madding with the English Bible in their hands, and brought to vouch their Exorbitances and horrid villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; I need say nothing of the mischievous consequences of this promiscuous License of reading the Bible; those that thumb'd it so much having prov'd themselves the most exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable Villains and Hereticks that ever the Sun shone upon: but shall only give two or three instances, for what I have said.</p>
            <p>Which when people have weighed and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously consider'd, they will not so stare and stamp, and cry out; Oh, this man would rob us, not of our goods, our wives, our good names, and our lives, but that which is dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to us than all these, he would rob us of our dear English Bibles; then come the days of darkness again, and of ignorance; oh look to him he robs us of our Bibles, is not here a Popish plot?</p>
            <p>And you will have cause to thank him for it, more than all the Sermons that ever you heard from modern Orthodoxy; for this has ruin'd everlastingly the souls of millions of poor people guided with that frenzy and zeal, and has also shortned their days by duck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoying them into Rebellion and blood, blood being therefore given them to drink for they were worthy: But the trepanning Priest deserv'd the greatest punishment here
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:94128:59"/>
and hereafter, by drilling them into Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion and blood; by wresting and misapply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Scriptures, such as those<hi>—Curse ye Meroz—</hi>Bind your Kings with chains, and your Nobles with fetters of Iron; such Honour have all the Saints.<hi>—Babylon</hi> the great is fallen; and a hundred of the like temper.</p>
            <p>Whereas, all that I say, makes righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and peace to kiss each other, makes use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Swords and Guns, brings again the gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en age; where every man sitting under his own Vine and fig-tree, leads a holy and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py life here and hereafter, has a Heaven upon earth, breaking their Swords into Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shares, and their Spears into Pruning Hooks; there being no use of Armory, if the world were of my Religion herein contained; or rather of the true Christian Religion; the summ and scope whereof our Blessed Saviour delivered with his own mouth, and epito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miz'd in one verse and sentence, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 12. as abovesaid.</p>
            <p>But some instances I promis'd to give, to evidence that the English Bible is in some particulars erroneous, scarce sence, and of ill consequence. As, in part of our Saviours first Sermon, is rendred <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 41. <hi>And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:94128:60"/>
From this story and fiction, (by our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Bible,) father'd shamefully upon our Blessed Saviour, a Christian is bound, if he meet with any man that being stronger than he, forces or compels him, (though he be in post-hast, or going for a Mid wife, a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor or Chirurgeon upon life and death, or whatsoever occasion,) yet he must go ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, quite out of his way a mile, and may not call for the help of the Constable, or neighbourhood, or other good body, to defend him from this violence, but in a quiet submission and obedience, he must (thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd) go a mile; which way soever the compeller pleases, he must make no resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; but that's not all; he must go ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mile of his own accord; and being thus easie to be fool'd, at the two miles end, if the man compel him again further another mile, away he must trudge; and so along all <hi>England</hi> over, and the world over; for there's no end of this obedience, if a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian meets but with any compeller; or freed from him, happens upon another, that leads him about and about like an <hi>ignis fatuus,</hi> and all this by vertue of your English Bible, and in as plain words, as any that are in't, and as easie to be understood; without Metaphor, Allegory, figure or parable.</p>
            <p>What do you say to this now, you with your English Bible?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:94128:60"/>
Whereas, I say, it is false and untrue, and our Saviour never spoke such a senceless word in his life.</p>
            <p>For all that he said, as to this, was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Theodore Beza,</hi> (a better critick than a man,) renders truly<hi>—Et quisquis te angari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abit ad milliare unum, abi cum eo duo,</hi> that is, in English, Whosoever by vertue of an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or warrant, from the Magistrate under whose Jurisdiction thou livest, shall compel thee to go with him a mile, go with him twain.</p>
            <p>And signifies no more than that ready and cheerful obedience that is due to Authority, from every Disciple of Christ, who himself not only thus preach'd, but practis'd; there was no rebel Christians heard on, that fought their Christian Kings, nor so much as Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Kings or Heretick Kings, till <hi>Calvin, Knox, Hugh Peters, Richard Baxter, J. O. Father Grey-beard,</hi> and modern Orthodoxy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Constantius, Valens, Valentinian, Anasta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius, Justinian, Heraclius,</hi> were all <hi>Arrian</hi> Hereticks and Emperours, yet the Christians their Subjects never confederated in a Holy League and Covenant, to reform by arms in spite of their teeth; the Church militant in those times did not prove their Texts with
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:94128:61"/>
Sword and Gun; The <hi>Good Old Cause</hi> was not then in those days old enough for the swadling clouts: nay afterwards when <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> the Apostate was Emperour, there was no army of Saints, nor holy Redcoat-Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians that pull'd off his Crown, or cut off his head.</p>
            <p>Perhaps you'l say, thank them for nothing; their wills might be good, but their arms were too short; or perhaps they had no skill in their weapons, and though Christians and Saints, yet not Army-Saints.</p>
            <p>Yes, that they were, Army-Saints; but not Rebel-Saints; Army-Saints they were, and there were more Christians in <hi>Julian</hi> the Apostates Army, than all the Heathens and himself put together:</p>
            <p>As is evident by their chusing his successor, <hi>Jovinian,</hi> to be their Emperour, because he was a Christian, (but not till the Apostate was dead,) saying, one and all, one and all, <hi>Jovinian, Jovinian,</hi> for we are Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</p>
            <p>And our Blessed Saviour, as he preach'd this cheerful obedience, and also his Apostles, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.—1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2. so did our Saviour pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise.</p>
            <p>There was a Holy-day made, (by the Chief Priest, who then was Chief Jewish
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:94128:61"/>
Magistrate,) and no mention of it in Gods Law; but he declaim'd not against it, but quietly observ'd it himself, namely the feast of the Dedication, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 22, 23.</p>
            <p>He did indeed miracles to get better drink and meat, when poor people wanted it; but he never did a miracle to get money, or Coin, but only to pay his Assessment, Royal Aid or Poll-money, call it which you will, for it was each of them, and all of them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. 27. And all this only, by his example, to shew true Christians, that they ought to make no resistance, nor give offence.</p>
            <p>Thus you see I have made very good sence, and <hi>good use</hi> of <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 41. which your En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Bibles make ridiculously useless, and no sence consistent or compatible with our Blessed Saviours Honour, and Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.</p>
            <p>Again I'll instance in <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. which though it be sence, yet it is of dangerous consequence; and as interpreted by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptists, has made a great bustle in the world; and besides it seems somewhat a hard Chapter, That God Almighty should give a Sacrament to the Jews, namely that of Circumcision, as a Badge or token (as the word Sacrament signifies,) that all that wore
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:94128:62"/>
that Livery, belong'd to him, were his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible servants, in which he comprehended a man and his house, and would not so much as suffer one of the little boys, to go above eight days without this Badge and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</p>
            <p>And yet notwithstanding our Saviour in the Gospel should take away all these old Liveries, and give his people no new-ones, as good at least, and as large and as many, even for the children too, fitted as well as in the old Law:</p>
            <p>Or that our Blessed Saviour, under the Gospel which was to have larger extents, even to all nations, should take care only to mark his Sheep, and not the Lambs, by this Holy Badge and Sacrament of Baptism; and which was, and has been in all ages the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of all Christian people, nations and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages; excepting here and there, a bold, pragmatick, self-conceited Coxcomb, build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his saith upon this Text, and construe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in his own sence, knowing only the English Translation, nor scarcely that; not being able to speak or write true En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish.</p>
            <p>Look you here, saith he, look in the Commission, if it be not first teach, and then baptize—Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:94128:62"/>
the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy-Ghost.</p>
            <p>Indeed this, as we translate it, and read it in our English Bibles, has some colour, and looks plausibly.</p>
            <p>For though it is false, when they say Christ said, first teach and then baptize,—yet we put down in our English Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation Teach, in the order of the words, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Baptize.</p>
            <p>And though that do not prove any thing, nor move a rational man, that none should be baptiz'd before they be taught, any more than to perswade him that a Bullocks Horns do grow and put forth before their Hoofs, because it is said in the <hi>Psalm</hi> 69. 31. Bullocks that have Horns and Hoofs:</p>
            <p>Yet we have to do with people that know not the meaning of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and having their English Bible, they will stamp and stare with it like mad, thinking it is on their side, because it is in their hand.</p>
            <p>Then come I, &amp; pluck it out of their hand, and say away you bold impudent fellows, audacious Blasphemers, do you call this Gods word, it is not Gods word, Christ never said teach all nations, baptizing, &amp;c. away to your Shop-boards, your Looms and your Comb-pots; and that will be more beneficial
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:94128:63"/>
and advantageous both for your souls and bodies, than thus blasphemously to abuse Christ, by calling that his word, that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver spoke; if you heard the words he spoke, you understand them no more, than you do Greek or Syriack; therefore be not busie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodies, mind your own business, and do not like <hi>Gregory Father Grey-beard,</hi> argue of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity and policy, and tell the King what he should do, and the Clergy what they should do; for these are things above your shallow capacities, of a higher orb and motion, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove your reach, above your sphere.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Pragmatick</hi> will not believe a word of this, though it is wholsome, and futeable and good for him, and fits every thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him but his pride; yet he will cry out, he's undone, he's rob'd, (as <hi>Micah holla'd,</hi> when he had lost his foolish Images and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols,) <hi>Judg.</hi> 18. 24. <hi>You have taken away my Gods which I made, and the Priest and you are gone away, and what have I more? And what is this that you say unto me; what aileth me?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Poor man! What, lose all? lose that thou madest a God on? thy English Bible, which yet is not God, nor his word altogether: what, lose that which thou didst idolize and adore, and ask counsel of, and was thine Oracle, nay and lose the Priest too of this
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:94128:63"/>
English Translation, the good Taylor, the good Chimney-sweeper, the good Miller, the honest Tinker, the honest Weaver and Cobler, that left the vocations whereunto they were called, to become poor, bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone, English Priest to the great Idol, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Translation; and all he says is Oracle, and taken for Gospel; away go the women after him, and some silly men, and here and there a crafty knave; that when he and all his relations are almost broke, then to get custom and credit, after them goes he too; and the truth on't is, he has the best on't, together with the crafty, lazy knave that <hi>holds forth,</hi> for these rule all the other, are the <hi>Judas's</hi> and <hi>keep the bag,</hi> and the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and gatherings of their Church, yet throwing down their Half-Crown or an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel at a time among the rest, by their libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to drill on the rest, (the gain returning tenfold by such a venture,) For they keep the stakes, and though they open their purse wide, and their mouth for the nonce, yet they can soon make up their mouth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
            <p>Now I confess these crafty knaves will be cut at the heart, and cry out as if they were kill'd or rob'd, at this my plain deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and open their mouths wide, and set the poor fools which they make their dogs,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:94128:64"/>
to fetch and carry for them, and bark, and bite if they durst at whomsoever they clap their hands; but I am above them and their malice, safe in my charm for them<hi>—Deo confisus nunquam confusus.</hi> Which they no more understand, than they will do this my honest and faithful dealing with them, for their own good, if they consider it and weigh it without passion or prejudice, in the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of the Sanctuary; where I am as safe from their clamorous noise, as is the Moon from the jaws of the barking Currs.</p>
            <p>And if they would but hold their barking, till they do but hear me speak, I should stop their mouths more than any modern Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Presbyter has done upon this Text, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. that ever I heard of.</p>
            <p>For, my honest friend, have a little patience, believe me that knows more than thy En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Translation, more than Cobler, Weav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and Chimney-sweeper, thy Bare-bone Priest, whom thou idolizest; and when thou hast adorn'd him and hung thy ornaments about him, then like the Israelites, thou ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirest him as they did their Calves, and sayst of him and thy English Bible, These are thy Gods, Oh <hi>Israel,</hi> that brought thee out of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> Popish Egyptian dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; I was baptized when I was a child, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in those times of darkness my Parents

knew no better, but here is the man, and here is the Bible, and here is the Text, Christs own Commission, which has brought me out of that errour and darkness.</p>
            <p>Alas! poor soul! deluded, bejugled, gull'd, abused and misled poor soul!</p>
            <p>Christ never said, Teach all nations ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptizing them, &amp;c. but said <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>So that now baptizing goes before teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, how do you answer this Mr. Black-coat Chimney-sweeper? your Idol cannot save you now, for it is the workmanship of mans hands, and subject to corruption.</p>

            <p>First, I answer, I am glad you see there is an absolute necessity of Schollarship, more than a bare understanding and reading of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish; an absolute necessity to keep up and give encouragements to a Learned Clergy, and that you lose your own eyes, at least your own spectacles, your own lights, when you contemn them, despise them; it is as the

            <p>Or if he should call his guide again, and instead of him, one as blind as himself should happen to be near him, they might talk a little together, but this other blind man could not help his fellow home, nor keep out of the ditch, nor avoid the stumbling-blocks, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this same, or both of the blind men were bedaub'd with gold and silver lace; or if their heads were adorn'd with a huffing Peruke, but wanting eyes and a guide, they must necessarily both fall into the ditch.</p>

only here's the difference, mine Ass is good for something, gives good milk for a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, and is a repairer and restorer of the wasted body, and the Pockey Bones; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as your <hi>Ass-Gentleman</hi> is good for nothing, but is a waster instead of a repairer, does no good in his generation, so much as the beasts, seeming to be born for no other end, but to run squeaking up and down like the Rats and the Mice, and to gnaw cheese and Parmasin; and eat up the victuals.</p>

            <p>For as when there was no King in <hi>Israel,</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> every man did that which was right in his own eyes, their liberty, they long'd for, reduc'd them to such confusions and streights, that they were forc'd for their sakes and benefits to call in the King, whose own right it was:</p>

            <p>Which certainly will suffer, if these mens

            <p>For though no Clergy-man gets either love or thanks, more than any other Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of State, by concerning himself in the great affairs of State; (those that inhabit the temperate Zones, having more ease, and less sweat and danger, though not so near the Sun and his directer Beams,) yet certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is good for the King and Kingdom, that they should have (as by Law their due,) a considerable influence upon and inspection into the great affairs of State.</p>
            <p>And I am of <hi>Gregories</hi> opinion in that <hi>p.</hi> 301. That <hi>they make the best Ministers of State in the world, if they keep them to their Bibles;</hi> 'tis true, all men have errours, but they are in probability more like to keep to their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, than any other sort of men.</p>

God therefore at first gave the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Priests, and Prophets, and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, such as <hi>Moses</hi> was, and <hi>Samuel, David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> and made the Kingdom happy under their oversight; as <hi>England</hi> has been made as happy by their influence in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as by any other sort of men what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, till the Kingdom's happiness fell with them, by the advance of modern Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxy.</p>
            <p>And it is worth the remembring, that when the House of Lords voted the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops out of the House, and from the seats to which they had as good right as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; they did but thereby become their own Cryers, and made Proclamation to dissolve their own Court; the Spiritual Lords only first going out at the door, and showing the rest of the Lords the way down stairs; and the most of the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons followed soon after.</p>
            <p>But my pen runs like Mr. <hi>Prin</hi>'s, I have almost forgot where I was; Oh! at the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, why did not our Translators of the Bible, render the Original more exactly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to English?</p>
            <p>To which I answer, the Translators in King <hi>James</hi> his time, did well and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly; mended many things that were amiss, and deserve great Honour and thanks; but
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:94128:67"/>
they did but cobble some things, <hi>Bernardus non videt omnia;</hi> and some inconveniences in wording it, they did not, nor could not fore-see: such as this of the Anabaptists mistake, and misconstruction in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.

As if our Blessed Saviour should say, as he does in another place, seeing you see, and yet you do not perceive; and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you hear, and do not understand; ye search the Scriptures, thinking to find this eternal bread, that I am preaching of, namely, eternal life by Christ, and there you may see me, for they testify of me, yet

ye will not come (for so is <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, may be taken in the Imperative Mood, but that it is not so agreeable with the context, nor signifies any thing, if it were so, to prove this promiscuous use and license of reading the Gospel and New Testament, of which not one word was then writ.</p>
            <p>Indeed no man in the world can desire more than I do, that all people did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Scriptures, the mind and will of God, by reading and searching into the Scriptures themselves, and also into the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Bible, so they read and search with the spirit of meekness, for instruction, and not for cavil and disputes, raising contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies and horrid new opinions out of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult places of Scripture, not knowing what they say, nor whereof they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm.</p>
            <p>Those controversies should be left to those of greater abilities, and of more sober spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits than themselves.</p>
            <p>There are plain places of Scripture enow

for edification and to direct us in the way to Heaven, by living soberly, righteously and godly in this present world.</p>
            <p>And he answered smartly and well to a Fanatick, but a light heel'd Gentlewoman, that was mightily perplex'd with finding out the meaning of <hi>Daniel, Ezekiel</hi> and the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations;</hi> that <hi>she had been better employed,</hi> if she had consider'd <hi>the meaning of those plain Scriptures;</hi> Thou shalt not commit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery; and Fear God, and Honour the King.</p>
            <p>I wonder what rational account any man that understands only the English Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, can give why the Pharisees should find fault, <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 1, 2. with Christs Disciples for plucking the ears of corn, as they pass'd through the corn fields, and did eat, rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing them in their hands? did not the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees eat on the Sabbath days? yes surely, and if they eat any thing, could not eat less, nor more easily made ready, than rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the Corn out with their hands, and eating some of the grains; meat ready dress'd in, and to their hands.</p>
            <p>And though some Sabbath days were kept with more abstinence than others, and more solemnity; yet the English Translation
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:94128:69"/>
help us to no discovery, calling that Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath only—The second Sabbath after the first.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The second Sabbath after the first!</hi> what's that? If the Jews had a Sabbath that was called the first Sabbath, (as indeed they had,) namely, the Feast of the Passover when the first day thereof fell on a Sabbath day; then by this translation this Sabbath day, (when the Disciples plucked the ears of Corn and did eat,) must be the second, and next following Sabbath to it. But that is not true, because it is not the meaning of the original word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, neither helps at all to solve the doubt, as being but an ordinary Sabbath, on which it was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to eat a Break-fast: but it was not lawful to eat a Break-fast, or drink any thing by the Jewish Canon, until the sixth hour, (which we call Noon, or twelve a Clock,) <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 1. which our English Translation renders ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry imper<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ectly and untruly, the second Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath after the first, and <hi>Beza</hi> renders it much worse, namely, <hi>Sabbato altero primo.</hi> And not at all to the purpose.</p>
            <p>The incomparable <hi>Grotius</hi> renders it best, and gives the best reason for that reddition;
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:94128:69"/>
namely, the second Prime-Sabbath: that is, the day of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> on which it was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to eat a break-fast, or eat or drink till twelve a clock; and therefore did the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees find fault with the Disciples, not for eating upon a Sabbath day, as every body did, as well as their beasts; but for eating upon the <hi>second Prime Sabbath,</hi> the day of Pentecost.</p>
            <p>And this thus explain'd gives a very good account of the strength of S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to prove that the Disciples were not drunk, as some did suppose, when they spoke with new tongues upon the day of <hi>Pentecost, Acts</hi> 2. 1. 15.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>These are not drunk, seeing it is but the third hour of the day,</hi> or nine a clock.</p>
            <p>Why? Is't not probable men may be drunk by nine a clock? yes, on other days, but not on that day the day of Pentecost, or second Prime Sabbath, when none were suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to sell any wine or meat, or drink, nor tast any thing till twelve a clock, or the sixth hour.</p>
            <p>A great many more imperfections there are in our English Bibles, which I had rather
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:94128:70"/>
were mended, than discover'd: these Instances are sufficient to abate the confidence of those bold companions, that instead of being teachers of others, had need learn more hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and modesty themselves; and not be so desperately devoted to a new opinion built upon false grounds, whose foundation is not laid upon the rock of ages, Christ and his word; but upon the sandy bottoms of self conceit and the English Bible.</p>
            <p>I hope therefore that without any <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logism</hi> I have evidenc'd that what the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Bishop <hi>Bramhall</hi> has asserted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the promiscuous License of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualified persons reading the Sciptures is, (though a Paradox in this hypocritical age, where the appearance and profession of piety is more priz'd than the truth, yet) not Apocryphal, nor Popish: as <hi>Father Grey-beard</hi> maliciously insinuates <hi>p.</hi> 30. ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring him thereby an enemy to the Lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>

            <p>Did they not then, as he now, endeavour to enrage the people and rowze them again, (when they are tyred and willing to be quiet,) with new jealousies and fears, fears of Ceremonies, fears of losing their Bibles, and their Sabbaths? rendring the Eminent Bishops dead and alive, friends in their hearts and doctrines too to Popery, but for a certain reason, rather making love to it, than espousing it? He sets not down these opinions of Bishop <hi>Bramhall</hi>'s with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to confute them, ('tis beyond his abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,) but only notes them with an <hi>Asterism</hi> as bordering upon Popery, as pernicious to the Laity; to beget in them new heats a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Church, by exposing the deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of King <hi>Charles</hi> I. and all his choicest Bishops for the love they bore to <hi>Ceremonies</hi>

and <hi>Arminianism;</hi> and making all their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, (both of those deceased, and of those yet in power and alive) to be wholly trivial if not prophane.</p>

               <hi>A Cause too good?</hi> too good for what? too good to be burnt does he mean? as it was by the common Hangman; or too good for the Rebel Saints? I'l assure you they did not think so; nor yet would, if it would please God and the King to entrust them with it once more; no, no, that's not this <hi>Authors</hi> meaning; he says it is <hi>the Cause too good to be fought for.</hi> Sure he thinks (as his friends <hi>H. P. J. O.</hi> &amp;c. blasphemed in that horrid Rebellion (begun by the Scots, but occasion'd and caus'd by Bishop <hi>Laud</hi> and consequently the <hi>King)</hi> That <hi>the battle was the Lords,</hi> and that <hi>men should standstill,</hi> (I wish they had,) and see the salvation of God; and <hi>that the stars in their Courses</hi>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:94128:74"/>
would <hi>fight against Sisera,</hi> (which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strued,) the King and Cavaliers.</p>
            <p>Sure this <hi>Greg.</hi> thought the King and Arch-Bishop, for sending the English <hi>Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy</hi> into <hi>Scotland,</hi> did thereby involve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and the Kingdom in so much guilt, that the <hi>Cry thereof would go to Heaven</hi> (for less he cannot mean) and that God ought in justice to have taken the cause into his own hand, and destroyed us (as he did <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah)</hi> with fire and brimstone, and thereby have sav'd the Rebels a labour, and the Scots a long march into <hi>England. Greg.</hi> would have been an happy instrument to have perswaded the Scots to put up their pipes, for the cause was too good to be fought for.</p>
            <p>Yet it seems it is not too good to be writ for, nor to good to be commended again to the world; this mans a great friend to the King, to the Bishops, to the Government, to the English Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, which he represents to have been so mischievous in former times; and now he quarrels with the Letany, because the word Schism is added: he does not like that men should pray against Schism; I am afraid one great quarrel and irreconcileable, he has against the Liturgy, is the same as of old,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:94128:74"/>
because it makes men pray so oft for the King and his Family, to which some mens hearts cannot say <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He might as well have quarrelled the Letany for another word there added; namely, <hi>Rebellion:</hi> But that had been to rob without a Vizard: the Picque now is only against Schism. And why? and why? he tells us, <hi>It spoils the Musick, and cadence of the Period.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Men that never intend to repent of their Crimes, love not to hear of them; sure I am, <hi>Schism</hi> in the <hi>Letany</hi> there added, spoils not the <hi>Musick</hi> so much, as it does <hi>the Kingdom;</hi> which by it alone has been <hi>quite out of tune.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I wish with all my heart though, that the King and his two Houses of Parliament would take <hi>Gregory</hi>'s advice, <hi>p.</hi> 304. <hi>After all the fatal Consequences of that Rebellion, which can only serve as Sea-marks unto wise Princes, to avoid the Causes.</hi> And what were the causes? (if you will believe his hint) they were Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and much more King <hi>Charles</hi> I. <hi>p.</hi> 302. the English Liturgy, <hi>p.</hi> 303. and the zealous assertors of the Rights of Princes, who are but at best, <hi>well-meaning Zealots, p.</hi> 303.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:94128:75"/>
Is't not pity but this <hi>Gregory</hi> should be call'd to the Helm of Government? 'tis Pilots own self, he shows wise Princes all the Sea-marks; here's <hi>Scylla,</hi> there <hi>Charybdis;</hi> here lies the flats, there the Beacon; here the Buoy, there the Fire-house; here lies Dogger-bank, there the Galloper; and that sand with the two horns, is the <hi>spits,</hi> that beyond, <hi>Goodwin Sands,</hi> but here, here, <hi>whoop, holla, holla, whoop, p.</hi> 150, 151, 152, 153. the Kings Channel.</p>
            <p>Good Skipper! so much skill, and so much pains, such a Politician, and a <hi>Virtuoso</hi> to boot, thou shalt have a new Perry-wig, and once more another Gratuity sent thee from <hi>J.

            <p>Is it not meritorious enough? he super-erogates; gratifies the Churches by shriving them, and laying all the blame upon that odious and hated thing <hi>the Liturgy,</hi> that was the cause of all the blood-shed, all the wars and ruine; that the rock on which we split; mind the <hi>Sea-marks,</hi> wise Princes, avoid

            <p>'Tis but lost money now to fee any Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers to put in a seasonable word for Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and modern Orthodoxy; <hi>Father Grey-beard</hi> for all.

            <p>The Cabala cannot but approve the plot, <hi>Greg.</hi> is greater than a second <hi>Moses,</hi> he's a second <hi>Samson,</hi> can <hi>carry the whole house a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Methinks I see him <hi>at it:</hi> and addressing himself to the <hi>Speaker,</hi> makes this following speech in the Parliament House, composed out of his own book; (for I scorn foul play;) nor will I adde one material word of mine own, to make him look more ridiculously or seditiously, than he has already with his own hand pourtrayed himself in his book; (only to make it to look more handsomely, I have dress'd it in the fashion in this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Droll <hi>a la mode;)</hi> in forty pages of his incomparable book, (like that self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited <hi>bookish</hi> Philosopher, that undertook

            <p>But here I fancy he is interrupted, speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so maliciously and inveterately against the blessed memory of King <hi>Charles,</hi> and saying <hi>his whole Reign was deform'd,</hi> in so great a Presence as this <hi>Parliament,</hi> which, (be it spoken as far from envy, as flattery,) yields to no preceding Parliaments for Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence as well as Loyalty, and therefore commands Mr. <hi>Greg.</hi> to the Barr, not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioning him for the good he had spoken, but for the evil.</p>
            <p>For he that spit in the face of that blessed Martyr did not thereby do him the hundredth part of that ignominy and harm; nor shew'd half so much venome harbour'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Father Grey-beard</hi> not contenting himself with what our late Soveraign, in
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:94128:79"/>
vindication of his peoples Laws and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, more than his own, has suffered from the hands of tyrannical and blood-thirsty men, but (as in the Enditement against him,) he charges him again with deforming his whole Reign, and by <hi>Sibthorpianism,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting an absolute Government, upon which rock, (he is bold to say) we all ruined, <hi>p.</hi> 302. It seems then this rock of absolute Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which the King surely affected, if he countenanc'd it so much as this auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious man would make us believe, for which the Rebels in no worse, but plainer terms, call'd him tyrant, and lay to his charge the guilt of all his innocent blood shed in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am sorry this man should again rip up the old sores, which we thought had been cicatrized without any deformity on the Kings part.</p>
            <p>And therefore he does with unparallel'd confidence attempt to talk so much of <hi>Sib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorp, Manwaring, Montague,</hi> &amp;c. It is the business of many pages, from <hi>p.</hi> 285. to <hi>p.</hi> 304.</p>
            <p>And to evince all this, the first and choicest weapon he brings upon the stage, is as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resistable, as terrible: there's no fence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a flail; he falls in pell-mell, without giving one volley, to close fight, Handy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gripes,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:94128:79"/>
and Butt of Musquet: (which he calls <hi>p.</hi> 281.) the Butt-end of an Arch-Bishop, (that was) <hi>Abbot,</hi> of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, (think I,) wo worth the day, look to thy hits, poor <hi>Bayes,</hi> and beat but <hi>this Butt-end of an Arch-Bishop</hi> about his ears, and I'll warrant him spoil'd for a fencer whiles he lives again.</p>
            <p>To make room, and heighten the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of this matchless onset, he would make men believe, <hi>p.</hi> 280. that the wounds that shall be given to his Majesty, Arch-Bishop <hi>Land,</hi> and the Government at that time, (by proving against them the guilt of <hi>Sibthorpianism</hi> and absolute Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,) are the wounds given by a <hi>Friend:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Against which there is no fence, we keep no guard against him, and being secure on that side, the thrusts (like that of <hi>Joab's</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the heart of <hi>Abner,</hi> and <hi>Amnen,)</hi> are certain and deadly; as being made with as little difficulty, as truth; and as easily and readily as basely and treacherously.</p>
            <p>And such is <hi>this Butt-end</hi> of an Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop; it admits no answer, cannot possibly be warded, 'tis the testimony of Arch—against Arch—the testimony of a friend.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:94128:80"/>
And I confess the testimony of a mans friend, (though but his supposed friend,) against him, shall find credit though false; whilest the evidence given in by an enemy, (through true,) is not believed, (like words of a frequent liar, though he tell truth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,) because all is construed the effects of practice, malice, or design.</p>
            <p>And if this <hi>Butt-end</hi> of an Arch-Bishop be indeed <hi>Abbot's</hi> Butt-end, which is not credible, (as I'll shew by and by, where indeed it was forged, and out of what Armory <hi>Greg.</hi> fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es this unavoidable dead doing tool; it is a hundred to one that we find that it came out of the Arcenal of <hi>Modern Orthodoxy;</hi> because <hi>Greg.</hi> (who is skilful and learned in nothing so much as that way) does bring it on to the stage, with marvellous prowess, to this Encounter;) yet the blows it can possibly give, will neither bring smart, nor infamy either to his Majesty, or Arch-Bishop <hi>Land,</hi> in the judgment of any By-stander, that knows but the temper of Arch-Bishop <hi>Abbot,</hi> what he was; and also the nature of this weapon, this same <hi>Butt-end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I need not give you the History here, (nor is this a place for it,) of the plottings and contrivances of the modern Orthodox in King <hi>James</hi> his time, from whose wardship though the King was set free by the privilege
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:94128:80"/>
of his English Crown, yet he was never e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancipated from the importunities of those busie, and unweariedly troublesome spirits; and t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ough he condescended to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference at <hi>Hampton-</hi>Court, where they, as well as his Majesty, saw themselves baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled:</p>
            <p>Yet these are not men that will give over so; but King <hi>James</hi> would many times, (whether for old acquaintance, or not quite forgetting his former pupillage under their imperious and pedantick tuition, nor altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at all times clearly remembring that now he was quite free, and <hi>sui juris;</hi> or whether, (as indeed very often he did,) to be rid of them and their busie intrusions) grant them very great favours; which he seems to repent of in his <hi>Basilicon Doron,</hi> when it was too late;</p>
            <p>Such was this advancement of <hi>Abbot</hi> to the Arch-Bishoprick, voic'd and carried up so high by the <hi>Cabal</hi> of the Puritans, or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Orthodox, who were gratifyed herein by that good natur'd King, not without too late repentance, though <hi>Abbot</hi> frustrated the expectations of both parties: for when he was got into Gods Blessing and the warm Sun, and so near the Court, he grew an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Courtier, yet not altogether forgetting his friends and Creators in the height of his fortunes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:94128:81"/>
King <hi>Charles</hi> did not make him, but found him, Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury;</hi> the place being for term of life, and both the King and he had too much innocence to shorten it, before God and nature had put it to an end.</p>
            <p>Yet the Arch-Bishop by reason of age, and the many infirmities and diseases of his mind and body, was very unmeet for Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil or Court, being very way-ward, peevish, morose, and unsociable for the reasons aforesaid.</p>
            <p>His Majesties affairs no more than nature could admit of this vacation, (occasion'd chiefly by his decrepit age and diseases:) it was thought fit therefore that his place should be supplyed by others, of more health and ability both of mind and body to do his Majesty service.</p>
            <p>This prepared the way to <hi>Laud's</hi> advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who then was but a young Cour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> and in no great esteem either with the King or Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> (though before the unhappy blow given that Favourite at <hi>Ports<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> he was high in his favour, as well as his Majesties, King <hi>Charles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Who,</hi> notwithstanding whatever <hi>Greg.</hi> does all along suggest, was no fool, but had the most piercing eye and judgment of any mans parts and behaviour about the Court.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:94128:81"/>
And therefore <hi>Laud</hi> (Doctor of the Laws, yet no Civilian but a Priest,) could not long at Court be neglected or obscure; being so vertuous, so pious, so wise a man, that his Majesty could not but discern his Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishments fitted for the greatest conndence of his Prince, and to which he arriv'd after the death of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> but not before; and therefore if King <hi>Charles</hi> his whole Reign was deform'd, it was not by him all the while, (here if I durst, I had told <hi>Greg. hoc est falsum,</hi> or <hi>restat probandum,</hi> or-in phrase of <hi>He, he lyes;</hi> but I am more modest, at least more wise, out of fear rather than ingenuity; he makes himself such a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Hector, <hi>p.</hi> 153. and <hi>p.</hi> 210.) But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> whilest he liv'd, bore all the blame, if any was due, as well as the shame.</p>
            <p>But after his death, what should be done to the man whom the King delighteth to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, but make him chief Favourite! and who more deserving than <hi>Laud,</hi> who <hi>studied to do both God and his Majesty good service, and was so pious and wise,</hi> as aforesaid?</p>
            <p>But envy, envy, (the shadow of greatness, inseparably attending those most who live in the brightest beams of Royal Bounty,) soon found out this great Minister of State.</p>
            <p>And envy it is, more than miscarriages,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:94128:82"/>
(to which all mortal men are subject,) which either shortens, or miserably disquiets the favourites of Princes; nor was ever any man therefore known to be a <hi>Favourite to two Kings</hi> immediately succeeding one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but the Duke of <hi>Buckingham;</hi> which he did owe to himself, more than his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; of which he was a miracle indeed, but a greater miracle of nature; and seem'd to be made for the very nonce, in so incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable a complexion of mind and body, which seem'd to disagree in nothing but a happy contention for precedency; the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his large mind seeming to strive with that of his incomparable body, which should be more amiable and sweetly ravishing; his prudence and gravity being adorn'd with a ready wit, and command of his tongue; which never had a denial of what it crav'd, even when he was by resolv'd and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin'd impeachments prosecuted in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where he had more admirers than friends.</p>
            <p>But a wiser than he has told us, <hi>who is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to stand against envy?</hi> It is probable the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> and Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud</hi> after him, did some things, as well as the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> that were not altogether <hi>approveable,</hi> or in strict account justifiable: induc'd thereunto rather by necessities than
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:94128:82"/>
any evil disposition of their own.</p>
            <p>Nor do men of inferiour rank know the reasons of State, and necessity of affairs, which might plead for Loans and Ship-money too, as our Saviour does for <hi>David</hi> (in his transgression of the Law, by vertue of a greater Law than <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> or the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of Right and necessity.) Have you not read what</hi> David <hi>did when he was an hungred, and they that were with him, how he entred into the house of God, and did eat the Shew-bread, which was not lawful for him to eat, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for them which were with him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor do these bold men know what are the pressures and urgent straits of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that cannot stay sometimes, without apparent ruine, the due redress of a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Especially when our wise King <hi>Charles</hi> could not but foresee, by former experiences, those heats of passion and sparks of preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice that by some incendiaries were likely to be kindled, and threatned those com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustions in the Kingdom, which afterwards by sad experience and tryals we found too true, and for very many painful years reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilesly groan'd and labour'd under.</p>
            <p>Not but that a Parliament is look'd upon by every honest English man, a most safe as well as acceptable constitution, both for the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:94128:83"/>
Prerogative and the Crown; as much as the peoples just properties and liberties.</p>
            <p>Yet at best it is but good Physick, and proves unsuccessful and unhappy for the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy politick, when perpetuated and made a constant food; of which truth we have in our age a fatal <hi>Probatum est.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And only proves that some diseases are with less pain and hazard tolerated, than irritated by putting the body into a constant course of Physick, in order to cure: which many times besides the trouble, does sooner and more certainly hasten that death, which before we did but fear.</p>
            <p>And sure I am that whatever is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Sibthorpianism, Manwaring, Arminia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uism, Montague, Absolute Government,</hi> or <hi>Loans,</hi> or any such frightful <hi>Bugs,</hi> (now brought again to scare the people with fears and jealousies,) yet put together, and at the worst they be no bigger than the little finger, in comparison of those thicker loins of pressures and grievances, with which to the death we were oppress'd and tyranniz'd over many years together in pretence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, and even still thereby our burdens are of nec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ssity become so much the greater.</p>
            <p>But were Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud</hi> and the <hi>Sib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorpians</hi> never so much to blame; were those sores &amp; grievances never so great, by what au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:94128:83"/>
or to what good end does this bold <hi>Greg.</hi> now rip them up again when they are healed and cicatrized?</p>
            <p>His design must be either to create jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies that his present Majesty or some great Favourites about him are again about to tread in <hi>Sibthorpian</hi> steps; (if this could be prov'd against him, he deserves to be hang'd:)</p>
            <p>Or else not satisfied with the indignities his blessed Father and the other Martyrs suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, crucifyes them again <hi>in Effigie;</hi> or as himself expresses it <hi>p.</hi> 280. And <hi>the detestable sentence and execution of his late Majesty, is represented again upon the Scaffold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus much for the temper of that Arch-Bishop <hi>Abbot,</hi> in answer to his charge against <hi>Laud,</hi> if it were truly his charge and narrative under his own hand: as <hi>Greg</hi> saith it was <hi>p.</hi> 281. And if it was so, what great matter does it signifye, That an old morose man, peevish by complexion and age, and improv'd to a far greater height of malice by the old Leven of modern Orthodoxy, fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by his own passions and sufferings, through the loss of his Place at Court and the Kings favour, his exercise of the Office-Metropolitan being also suspended, and the profits of the Arch-Bishoprick to better use, sequestred;</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:94128:84"/>
Occasion'd by the intelligence he kept with the factions, and not for refusing to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense a Sermon, (as is suggested,) as improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly as idlely, whether by other mens fictions or his own is not worth the enquiry.</p>
            <p>But such a deform'd Issue may shame either the Arch-Bishop <hi>Abbot,</hi> or any body else, that should pretend to father it; not but that some of its parts are truly form'd, but many of them are monstrous untruths; as if it were needful, I will demonstrate, and begin at the first three lines.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Greg.</hi> has pick'd these few that seem'd most for his turn out of that, (which indeed goes under his name, The <hi>Narrative of Arch-Bishop Abbot, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This audacious man as boldly calls <hi>it so,</hi> as if he had stood at his elbow, and saw him write every syllable, which he must have done, or else he is very impudent thus to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose upon men, that which he can but guess at, and has as little ground to build this faith of his upon, as ever any man had, that declared so audaciously, and confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as he does here, that any such Narrative in Print was another man's hand-writing.</p>
            <p>The truth is, <hi>Greg.</hi> his prime Talent lies in modern Orthodoxy; there he is best read, and there we find <hi>this Narrative,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And if he can show me this Narrative any
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:94128:84"/>
where else than there, (which I defye him to do;) then will I confess that this <hi>Butt-end,</hi> (which in his hand he does so terribly bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish and flourish,) is indeed the <hi>Butt-end of an Arch-Bishop;</hi> and when he has done, since it is but the Butt-end of <hi>that</hi> Arch-Bishop, at best is but an Abbots opinion, which is now no more credited, nor more Orthodox, than are the railings of <hi>Greg.</hi> or other the discontents of modern Orthodox.</p>
            <p>You may find it, if you will waste so much time as to read an old Diurnal, for such stuff is this, composed in a History forsooth, dedicated to Queen <hi>Dick,</hi> which was (in stile of modern Orthodoxy) <hi>Richard</hi> by the Grace of God, Protector of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Anno Domini</hi> 1657.</p>

            <p>I cannot but smile to see this <hi>Huffe,</hi> buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetting himself with this <hi>Butt-end</hi> of an Arch-Bishop; as at other times, he meditates his own ruine, (when I in mercy and poor pitys sake would step to the man, and stop him, laying violent hands upon himself,) in several pages of his own book; namely, when he says <hi>p.</hi> 8. <q>Nor was there any thing that could more closely import him, than that the race and family of the Railers should be perpetuated among mankind. <hi>And p.</hi> 18.

            <p>So my Gentleman, when the word Schism is but nam'd, he extolls it to the skies, or at

least says it is no such frightful thing, as the World takes it to be; take it into your hand, touch it, do, touch it, it will not hurt you; it is but a Theological Scar-crow, and rather frights than hurts; then like the mad Porter commends his old Master to the skies, ever since he had the honour of his acquaintance, when he was a School-boy at <hi>Eaton;</hi> O Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> of <hi>Eaton,</hi> how does <hi>Beauty and Majesty</hi> like two twins sit in thy large forehead with admiration?</p>
            <p>I should be as mad as he, if I should go about to answer seriously in Divinity with such a mad-cap, and do no more good of him, than upon the aforesaid Porter; if I thought he was not past hopes, I would give him a hundred Divines for his one; the worst of them all of far more learning, and less partiality and prejudice, than Mr. <hi>Hales,</hi> without any disparagement or just offence to his Master, that differ from him upon good reason in every thing that <hi>Greg.</hi> brings him to prove in reference to Modern Orthodoxy; all which Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> recanted after his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version.</p>
            <p>If I thought any wise man would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern himself, in good earnest, with what so trivial a pen as his scribles in Divinity, I would lengthen this letter upon that subject, though I am quite tyred already with his

not use to have too much modesty; come answer to this in your next Mr. <hi>Greg.</hi> I had rather hear of your honest Confession and Contrition, than any more <hi>Leasings,</hi> by which such as you are, strive to fill the peoples heads with Proclamations of <hi>Ceremonies, Superstition,</hi> put them in fear they cannot come at the Sacraments, the Church does so rayl it in; making them jealous and fearful with your <hi>Arminiansme, Montagueisme, Manwaringisme, Sibthorpianisme,</hi> and such frightful words; that though they know not the meaning of them more than your <hi>Nepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, Putanisme, &amp;c.</hi> yet they believe these are some ghastly things, and you do very ill to scare them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This is the way to perpetuate and keep up a strangeness and misunderstanding betwixt the King and his People;</hi> for the people are good people, and will hear reason, if it be spoken; but when such as you <hi>hold forth,</hi> and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in such a fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Dress, the people cannot find in their hearts to make love to her; but run from her, like mad, frighted out of their Wits &amp; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion too, by such <hi>Boutefeaus</hi> &amp; Incendiaries.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And all these mischiefs and all these dirty doings do lie at your doors,</hi> cleanse your self of them as well as you can.</p>
            <p>As School-boys have a Book of Phrases,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:94128:90"/>
collected out of the most fluent Latine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours, which they bring in to every Theam, and upon all occasions; so <hi>Greg.</hi> has here and there, amongst his mad <hi>Harangues,</hi> a smart expression now and then, which he and the <hi>Virtuoso's</hi> at a Club have chew'd to a Crambe, and now having gathered up the scraps, bunch'd them, and bound them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he dishes them up in this Book for a Publick feast.</p>
            <p>But alas <hi>Greg.</hi> does not consider that one man's meat is another man's poyson, and that which sutes one man's temper may kill another; especially in this age, when so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny people, like <hi>Mithridates,</hi> or the Maid in <hi>Pliny,</hi> live upon that, laugh and grow fat with that, that would ruine others.</p>
            <p>Perhaps amongst your Crew and Gang, such venemous expressions, as you disgorge in your Book against the Innocence and good fame of the late King, Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud,</hi> by the deformity of the Reign, with absolute Government, Ceremonies, &amp;c. and perhaps amongst your selves you do securely jeer and scoff at the Parliament, the Church, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Fathers of the Church, and Privy-Councellors, and great Ministers of State; thinking you speak <hi>under the Rose,</hi> and so all goes merrily down.</p>
            <p>But I'le assure you these works of
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:94128:91"/>
darkness, and words that are fit only for the place of darkness, malicious <hi>leasings,</hi> and consequently devillish and venemous words and discourses may not safely come abroad and be vended; though you pretend never so much mirth and innocency in your design. Apothecaries will not sell poyson to any but those they have great confidence in, not willing for a little gain to be so much as the remote occasion of mischief, not having Antidotes in all their Shop prevalent enough to check the malignity and energie of a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle poyson.</p>
            <p>And truly all your <hi>Peccavi's</hi> come too late, because no body can believe that the same tongue does in good earnest, in one breath speak contraries, and blow hot and cold to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at the same time.</p>
            <p>Indeed the man that blew his Pottage to make them cold, and blew his fingers to make them hot, came something near in like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, to your mouth; but the Story says, it was at several times, and he made two blasts on't; and two Periods.</p>
            <p>But you in one sentence and breath, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out stop or comma, talk of a whole Reign deform'd by the best Prince that ever wield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>English</hi> Scepter, and the like of the Arch-Bishop; you outdo all that ever I heard of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:94128:91"/>
And worse than the cruel <hi>Panther,</hi> that allures and entices his Prey to come near him, by sending forth a sweet scent and savour from his mouth, 'till the silly brutes (thus trepan'd) come within his grasp, and the reach of his bloody paw.</p>
            <p>Your breath is not so intirely perfum'd, but has two savours; I wonder any body that have their senses intire, should be in love with you; and but that you are incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable in your own conceit, I wonder you are so much in love with your self.</p>
            <p>And nothing do I admire more, excepting al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways your own unparallel'd confidence, than that any body should admire you for such a tall fellow, and tough Champion for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Orthodoxy, which you so often by your self-contradictictions betray, as well as therein your own weakness and infirmities.</p>
            <p>Indeed you manage a Cause that is plausi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enough (God knows) in these days, when you strike at the Bishops, who have not at present too many friends, and they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves scorning to be grave with a Buffoon; (it is his own phrase) and having not many that I see to take up the Gantlet in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence so readily as my self, though (I confess) with great disadvantage to my own fame.</p>
            <p>The Argument I undertake being not so plausible and taking in defending them now
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:94128:92"/>
a days, as your jolly opposition and affront; in which particular alone you have the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of me; mine is <hi>the better,</hi> though your's be the <hi>more acceptable</hi> Cause; and this alone makes you to be cry'd up for a <hi>Sampson,</hi> because <hi>you smite</hi> the Church and Clergy <hi>Hip and Thigh,</hi> though it be (be not angry) <hi>with the Jaw-bone of an Ass.</hi>

            <p>Is it not possible there should be true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and vertue under a <hi>Cassock</hi> or <hi>Lawn sleeve?</hi> Has <hi>Holland shirts,</hi> Perrywig and light Drugget got the Monopoly of true Nobility?</p>
            <p>As the Noblemen and Gentlemen would be affronted, if the Clergy should despise them, with your Proverb, <hi>Jack Gentleman:</hi> so why should not the Reverend Bishops and others be as much offended, when such a Pick-thank in a whole discourse seems to cry <hi>Jack Clergy-man?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King alone is the Fountain of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and are those streams of honour that flow from him, more pudled in a <hi>Clergy</hi> than a <hi>Lay-</hi>Channel? Does not the man forget his own Father?</p>
            <p>I hate the folly as much as the pride of such <hi>Upstarts,</hi> that because in their <hi>Pride,</hi> Jollity, and Atheism, they <hi>would</hi> cast con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt on the Clergy; in their <hi>folly</hi> they think they may and <hi>should</hi> cast contempt on the <hi>Clergy.</hi>

            <p>Which none probably does or can better understand, nor any in like probability better observe; 'tis true they are men, and subject to frailties, but all men as much, and in all likelihood <hi>more</hi> than they.</p>
            <p>And now I am upon't, I will but make tryal, what virtue there is in Perriwig <hi>Father Gray-beard,</hi> above all others, to make a <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician</hi> of.</p>
            <p>For he often ope's and gapes at <hi>Politick</hi> Lectures, like an Oyster, against the coming in of the Tide; it is his very element, and he is either there good, or no where worth the opening.</p>
            <p>I can scarce forbear smiling to my self to see how prettily he sets his face, and makes up his mouth, with such caution and gravity before he begins to read to Princes his <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick would-bees.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, blaming the <hi>Ecclesiastical Politician, (he</hi> must not be forgotten) for offering at that which was none of his Province, <hi>p.</hi> 61. <hi>Instructing Princes, like Sancho,</hi> how <hi>to govern his Island:</hi> And <hi>p.</hi> 206. <hi>He had put all Princes upon the Rack to stretch them to his dimension:</hi> And in another place, <hi>I am asham'd, Mr. Bays, that you put me on talking thus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinently,</hi>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:94128:93"/>
for <hi>Policy in us is so.</hi>

            <p>Now think I, we cannot be far off this <hi>Politick Lecture,</hi> it is either in front or reer, before or behind, it is hereabouts, look; for <hi>Greg.</hi> his whole book, <hi>then</hi> and <hi>there</hi> most condemns <hi>what</hi> he is forthwith about to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise; as formerly is instanced in the case of <hi>railing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To make the King and Parliament secure, he would lull them asleep with saying, <hi>p.</hi> 252. <hi>That men are all so weary, that he would be knock'd on the head that should raise the first di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance of the same nature,.

            <p>In the front of his Book, you have a strange and unheard of <hi>New Title,</hi> here he gives you the reason of it, he resolv'd there should be something in his Boook to make it <hi>sell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what if a man that had a mind to raise a disturbance should give the <hi>Good Old Cause a new Title,</hi> and call it the <hi>Cause too good,</hi> or Modern Orthodoxy, are not those Titles as <hi>new,</hi> and as ready made to a mans hand, as the <hi>the new Title</hi> to his book, and by the same hand too? this man cannot for his life, but he must confound himself.</p>
            <p>But <hi>he that should raise the first disturbance of the same nature would he knock'd on the head:</hi>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:94128:93"/>
would he so? I do not believe any man likes it so well, as to be willing to be knock'd on the head, except those knocks be fine gentle knocks, not Scotch <hi>Knox,</hi> nor <hi>Modern Orthodox knocks:</hi> they did knock so gingerly that not any man I know <hi>would</hi> be so knock'd with his good will however.</p>
            <p>I suppose by, <hi>would be knock'd on the head,</hi> he means, he <hi>ought</hi> or <hi>should</hi> be knock'd <hi>in</hi> the head; and that is somewhat deeper than <hi>on</hi> the head; it is as much as a mans life is worth, to be knock'd <hi>in</hi> the head, but to be knock'd <hi>on</hi> the head, may be but a <hi>Tailors blow,</hi> a knock with a Thimble, a Prick-Louse Rap.</p>
            <p>But not to play further with his words, <hi>the thing</hi> means as plain as <hi>it</hi> can speak, that the first Rebel that should make disturbance, must needs be knock'd i'th' head.</p>
            <p>Therefore disband your Red and Blue-Coats, you need not fence where there is no fear; the <hi>Modern Orthodox</hi> that use to be so busie and indefatigable, <hi>are now</hi> ('tis very strange, and news you tell us,) <hi>weary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As soon as ever I read this news, thought I to my self, and whispered, this is all <hi>Leasing,</hi> the Factions and Modern Orthodox weary? 'tis impossible.</p>
            <p>As they are the Modern Orthodox, so they are the never-to-be-tired modern Peripate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks: what they that wearied two <hi>Kings;</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Are these modern Pharisees that compass Sea and Land to make one Proselyte, and when he is gain'd, make him more a child of Hell than he was before, <hi>now weary?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Does the <hi>Father</hi> of lies walk to and fro through the earth, and like a roaring Lion seek whom he may devour, and yet is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver tyred with doing mischief; and can the <hi>children</hi> of lyes so degenerate? can those evil speakers, lyars and slanderers, (in the French and Greek Languages, Devils,) now be weary and shame the stock they came of?</p>
            <p>I should not believe this fair tale <hi>Greg.</hi> tells, though I did not by sad experience know to the contrary: for though I did not live among such men, nor know the men and their communication, yet I know the <hi>nature</hi> of the men, the Devil must be weary
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:94128:94"/>
of tempting, before <hi>such</hi> natur'd men be weary of acting.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Greg.</hi> did but know the boldness, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence, confederacy, contrivances, designs of these men so well as I do, he could not with such impertinent and ridiculous Lulla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees, <hi>pass his word</hi> for the <hi>Nonconformists,</hi> (how much soever he loves them,) if <hi>his word</hi> be any thing worth.</p>
            <p>Not that I think truly that they either can or will bite, but thanks to his Majesties vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilancy, they dare not; the wolves in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> assault not, nor attempt upon any man that is well arm'd for them, but his nature is nevertheless as rapacious and wolfish.</p>
            <p>Nor can he be a friend to publick tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, that by perswading to too much security, renders all unsafe.</p>
            <p>I am sure King <hi>Charles</hi> I. never gave them an Inch, but they took an Ell, and found (too late, and to his cost,) how irreconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to all gratitude, and good nature, that sort of men continue, and says in <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>I cannot yet learn that Lesson, nor I hope ever will you, that it is safe for a King to gratifie any faction with the perturbation of the Laws, in which is wrap'd up the publick interest, and the good of the Community.</p>

               <p>Provided the differences amount not to an insolent opposition of Laws and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, or Religion established, as to the essentials of them, such motions and min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings are intolerable.</p>

               <p>The Serpent will devour the Dove: you may never expect less of Loyalty, Justice or humanity than from those, who engage into religious Rebellion; their interest is always made Gods; under the colours of Piety, ambitious Policies march not only with greatest security, but applause, as to the populacy; you may hear from them <hi>Jacob</hi>'s voice, but you shall feel they have <hi>Esau</hi>'s hands.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>These</hi> indeed are <hi>Politicks,</hi> fit to be read to <hi>wise Princes,</hi> that observing the <hi>Sea-marks,</hi> they may avoid the <hi>fatal consequences,</hi> that excellent Prince experimented to his cost; It is pity goodness should ever prove evil, or that the Sun-shine of Royal Bounty, should the more harden some sorts of men.</p>
            <p>Who, like true <hi>Sheba</hi>'s, sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> that will endure no yoke, no restraint of Laws,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:94128:96"/>
no Reins of Government, grow head-strong, and getting the bit in their teeth, away they run neck-break over hedge and ditch, till they throw themselves and their rider both into the ditch.</p>
            <p>And then, <hi>(not till then,)</hi> at their wits end, tyred with their own licentious wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonness, they entreat their rider to get up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and guide them and govern them.</p>
            <p>For indeed the Crown is more beneficial to the people, than to him that wears it; for he has more cares, more hazards, more perplexities; and yet neither eats, drinks, nor sleeps better than millions of the people, nay sometimes as much in debt as any of them.</p>
            <p>So that I have sometimes wondred with my self that ever any man who had wit e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to be a knave, and was knave enough to be an Usurper, should have so little wit as to wade in blood so deep only to get the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of a Crown.</p>
            <p>Which how steddy soever it sits on any Kings head, is yet weighty and more trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some than gay; and thousands that behold him have less cares and hazards, and yet wear as good cloths, and eat and drink as well as he, or any man can; for to <hi>swoop</hi> like the <hi>Gipsie-Queen</hi> a dissolv'd Jewel worth ten thousand pound for a mornings draught, is
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:94128:97"/>
not <hi>now</hi> deem'd a Cordial.</p>
            <p>And if Ambition and Faction were not Monsters, one would marvel that <hi>Greg.</hi> should so disquiet himself with Picques at the <hi>Privy Counsellors and Bishops:</hi> who by their great places have greater cares and perils, and are to be pitied, rather than envyed.</p>
            <p>And then for him to do all this with <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick-scraps</hi> gathered up when let fall at a <hi>Club</hi> in the Tavern or Coffee-house, bound up with patches out of Diurnals, old Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment &amp; Army Declarations, Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> of <hi>Eaton</hi> his account of Schism, and <hi>Rushworth</hi>'s orts, is intolerable presumption through a ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous conceit of his own abilities by such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements.</p>
            <p>He had <hi>hit it,</hi> and had more seasonably transcrib'd <hi>Rushworth,</hi> if he had given us a report out of the speech of Mr. <hi>Glanvile,</hi> a great Lawyer and excellent Orator, which quadrates the <hi>March-Declaration</hi> to an inch; in telling us how far the Prerogative may lawfully entrench upon an Act of Parliament, <hi>p.</hi> 578. and 579. There is a trust inseparably reposed in the persons of the Kings of <hi>Euglond,</hi> but that trust is regulated by Law, &amp;c. Statutes incorporate into the body of the common Law, over which (with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence be it spoken) there is no trust re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in <hi>the Kings Soveraign Power and Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative</hi>
               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:94128:97"/>
               <hi>Royal</hi> to enable him to dispense with them, or to take from his Subjects that Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, or inheritance which they have in their Liberties by vertue of the Common Law, and of these Statutes.</p>
            <p>And I believe there is not a man in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> but admires the goodness and wisdom of his Majesty and his Privy-Council in that <hi>March Declaration</hi> for Indulgence; as a new experiment, to make tryal upon the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Orthodox once more, how good so much goodness will make them, who hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto like clay in the Sun, have been the more hardened by the Beams of Royal Bounty.</p>
            <p>For sad experience has instructed us, that the Head-strong Jade, rides with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est grace, when rein'd in with a Curb.</p>
            <p>Yet for all this, as if this <hi>Greg.</hi> our young <hi>Machiavel,</hi> had the Law in his own hand, he <hi>tutors</hi> our wise Princes, shews the <hi>Sea-marks,</hi> and reads Politick-Lectures 12 <hi>pages</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>The great design he promotes is to teach his Prince <hi>the art of forge-fulness;</hi> not the art of memory, but the art of <hi>Gentlemens me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories;</hi> by which he means, (if he have any meaning) a loose, flashy, watery memory, that will hold no Print, nor retain impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:94128:98"/>
And though to help the impression and memory of some things forgot, he insinuate <hi>Sibthorpianism, Manwaringism</hi> and <hi>Montague<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ism,</hi> and <hi>Laudism;</hi> yet to remember that ever there was a Rebellion or harm in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Orthodoxy, then <hi>p.</hi> 253. believe him <hi>Kings as they have Royal Understandings, so have Gentlemens memories.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, he will not suffer His Majesty, our gracious Soveraign, so much as to retain any good nature, or gentle impressions of <hi>his Father's</hi> being <hi>murthered;</hi> if he has, <hi>Greg.</hi> makes him sorfeit his Gentility; he ought to have a Gentleman's memory.</p>
            <p>And is it so indeed good <hi>Greg?</hi> Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not a King be Gentile, though he retain his nature? And cannot he be gentile except he bid defiance to all good nature too? And can a man retain any good nature, if he quite forget he had a Father and murther'd too? Or if he must be disciplin'd by you into that forgetfulness, why should his memory be supplied with those ungrateful Resentments and Impressions of <hi>Sibthorpianism, Manwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringism, absolute Government, the deformity of his Father's whole Reign?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed <hi>Father Gray-beard</hi> you are a very hard hearted and cruel Tutour as ever Prince submitted unto for Pupillage and Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:94128:98"/>
And why shall not his Majesty keep in memory, (except in Gentleman's memory) that his Dear Father was murther'd? Why do you say? For a great many <hi>whyes? J. O.</hi> for one, can tell you a great many: and his friend <hi>Greg.</hi> can also tell you a great many <hi>wherefores.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not <hi>wherefores only, why</hi> the King should not remember that his Father was murther'd; nor only, who plotted, contrived, and were accessories thereunto; but <hi>also wherefore</hi> he should look to himself also for fear, and take heed, <hi>special heed</hi> of offending those that having been flesh'd and bloodi'd already in the Royal Chace, are the more terrible. This is <hi>Gregories</hi> Policy.</p>
            <p>Whereas <hi>Almighty God</hi> teaches Princes, who are Gods on earth, by his own example, <hi>with the froward to show themselves froward,</hi> Psal. 18. 26. and as Job 29. 17. <hi>Break the Jaws of the wicked, and pluck the spoyl out of their Teeth.</hi> The Hebrew word there ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>Jaws,</hi> signifies <hi>the Grinders,</hi> or the <hi>Jaw-teeth;</hi> and is an allusion to the practise men use to curst currs, and mastives that are <hi>man-keen;</hi> they break their Teeth, their sharp Grinders; a toothless Dog bites not much more than a dead dog: as if Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God by these things should say to Princes, Courage! <hi>Regum est parcere subjectis, &amp; debellare</hi>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:94128:99"/>
               <hi>superbos;</hi> Be not afraid of a Curr-dog or grinning Rebel; knock their teeth out, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm them, trust them and hang them; or, as our King's blessed Father says as aforesaid; If <hi>ever you trust them, or must stand to their courtesie, you are undone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But comes me <hi>Greg.</hi> reads quite another Lesson, and instead of <hi>breaking the Teeth of the ungodly, and smiting his enemies upon the check-bone,</hi> (as God by King <hi>David's Army</hi> did the Rebels in <hi>Absalom's Army,</hi> Psal. 3. 7.) he would perswade the King into a Panick fear, and to flatter the factious rabble, as unmanly as unwise: Nay, not so much as to remember, but quite forget his Father, or that he was murther'd; and since it is past, so let it go.</p>
            <p>This must be the meaning of <hi>p.</hi> 241, 242, 243, 244, 245, 246, 247, 248, 249, 250, 251, 252, and 253. or else they are non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and have no meaning in reference to what he retorts upon the Ecclesiastical Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician, <hi>p.</hi> 241. He goes a great way at first setting out for an Instance of this New Divinity and Policy; and truly so he had need; for such examples are rare in History, wise Princes were wiser than so; and though he finds one Prince in <hi>England,</hi> since Modern Orthodoxy came up, and got the upper hand, <hi>Charles</hi> I. that had not been treated
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:94128:99"/>
               <hi>so ill,</hi> if he had not been <hi>so good;</hi> yet this supererogating goodness is seldom sound in story.</p>
            <p>The first instance he fetches as far as <hi>Rome,</hi> and 1700 years ago, (excepting two moneths and three days, seven hours, seventeen mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes to a second) in <hi>Augustus Caesar whose Father too was murthered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Too was murther'd? This must relate and can relate only to the King <hi>whose Father too was murther'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But first I deny that <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi>'s Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was murther'd: and that it is as false as that King <hi>Charles</hi> I. his <hi>whole Reign was deform'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now is <hi>Greg.</hi> gravell'd, I feel him at the first step he takes, and knows not how to go a foot further, except lamely as he goes halting all along.</p>
            <p>And if <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi>'s Father was not murther'd, though he had never so much a <hi>Gentleman's memory,</hi> yet it is nothing to the case in hand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi>'s Father died in his bed, the threed of his life was spun out as long as it would run naturally; there was neither Ax, nor <hi>Gregory,</hi> nor <hi>Father Gray-beard,</hi> nor <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaw,</hi> nor Sword, nor Dagger, nor <hi>Senate-</hi>house, nor <hi>Brutus,</hi> nor <hi>Cassius</hi> in the Case.</p>
            <p>Why? then saith <hi>Greg.</hi> (I know his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge)
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:94128:100"/>
               <hi>His Uncle was murther'd:</hi> Oh my Nuncle! But why does <hi>Greg.</hi> then say, <hi>his Father too was murther'd?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is <hi>Greg.</hi> his own self, he has heard in a Coffe-house, or a Play-book that <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> succeeded <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> in the Empire, and so he takes it for granted he was his Son; and because <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> was murther'd, therefore <hi>Augustus</hi> his <hi>Father too was murther'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> was not so near a kin to him neither, as <hi>Brutus</hi> that stab'd him, who was also his Nephew, and some say <hi>more than his</hi> Nephew; and though it was not so commonly known till after his death, yet <hi>Caesar</hi>'s last words to <hi>Brutus,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

            <p>The <hi>Triumviri</hi> sharing the Government amongst them, 'till they had destroyed <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> and <hi>Cassius,</hi> and all the Confederates in that bloody Conspiracy, not leaving a man alive that had a hand in <hi>Caesar</hi>'s fall.</p>
            <p>And what <hi>Greg.</hi> can make of this, or <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus Caesar</hi> for his purpose, for my part, I do not know; for let it go so, that <hi>Augustus</hi>

               <hi>Caesar's Father too was murther'd;</hi> then (I also add) his Father's Murtherers were kill'd for that murther; But either this latter part of the story was not in the Play, or else <hi>Greg.</hi> did not stay to the end of it, to hear whether the Comedy (which he thinks makes for his sport and design) did not end in a Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; namely, the death and destruction of them that murther'd <hi>Caesar—</hi>But that did not make for his purpose; but would have spoyled all, and the King's murtherers would not have thank'd him for his Plea.</p>
            <p>Because then he must have spoke against them instead of speaking for them; and if he had spoke the story out, he must have said<hi>—His Father too was murther'd, but his Successors did hang up and destroy those murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,</hi> every mother's Son. As that King did, <hi>Matt.</hi> 22. 7. not for murthering his Father, but a far less fault, the murthering only of his servants; and therefore <hi>he destroyed those murtherers and burnt up their City,</hi> for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to all the King-killers in the Christian World.</p>
            <p>I wish <hi>Greg.</hi> had not nam'd for his purpose this <hi>Augustus Caesar, whose Father too was murther'd;</hi> and 'tis ten to one but he has as ill luck in all the rest; for never did blind Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher more over-shoot himself, than does this <hi>Greg.</hi> But now his first Bolt aim'd indeed, and

            <p>Yet do not I deny but that Honey lick'd off a thorn, Wooll pick'd off a hedge, and Phrases pick'd out of a Comedy, Diurnal, <hi>Hales,</hi> Clubs, <hi>Rushworth</hi>'s Speeches, and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my Declarations are very good things in themselves, and as useful in compiling some Books, as is <hi>Thesaurus Poeticus</hi> to help Fancy, both with matter and words, when a School-boy composes a Copy of Verses.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Let any man judge by his words, if <hi>Greg.</hi> does not intend by all this, that His Majesty should in the case of His Father's murther, take example at <hi>Hen.</hi> IV. of <hi>France,</hi> and his Cabinet-Counsel, rather than follow the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the <hi>Eccles.

            <p>And if this be the meaning of his words, (which I think neither he nor any man can construe otherwise) let us consider how apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Gentleman fits the story to our King, and the Case of His Father's murther.</p>
            <p>If the murtherers of <hi>Hen.</hi> III. and <hi>Hen.</hi> IV. of <hi>France</hi> were mercifully dealt withall, and not prosecuted to the utmost; then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and not otherwise does it plead at all for the murtherers of His Majesties Father;
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:94128:102"/>
so that if His Majesty deal but by them, as his Kinsman <hi>Hen.</hi> IV. of <hi>France,</hi> and his Cabinet-Counsel have left him a glorious Pattern to imitate; then I perceive there is no great fear but His Majesty may still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in <hi>Father Gray-beard</hi>'s good favour.</p>

Both these murderers were tortured, their flesh by piece-meal nip'd off with red hot pincers, and lastly drawn in pieces with four Horses.</p>

               <hi>Ravilliack</hi> had a Father and a Mother alive, but not the least suspicion of confederacy with their Son in that fatal stroke could be laid to their charge; but in detestation of such a monster brought forth into the World, his parents were for ever banish'd, and the house wherein the villain was born and brought forth into the World was pull'd down and made a Dunghill unto this day.</p>
            <p>This is the truth of the story; if it be not, let <hi>Greg.</hi> if he can or has impudence enough, deny it; and if so, then Mr <hi>Greg.</hi> must either conclude that his Majesty and Cabinet Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel are very shallow, and meanly conversant in the History of his Progenitors and Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Nation, and so believe the groundless insinuations of this impertinent man; or else he falls upon the party he has espoused with another <hi>terrible but-end</hi> and counterbuff, by perswading his Majesty to follow the example of his Kinsman <hi>Hen.</hi> IV. of <hi>France,</hi> and his Cabinet, and not leave one of our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>killers alive; or if there be any on whom the innocent blood of his Father still calls for vengeance, that he would first put them upon the Rack, and make them confess who it was

besides the Devil and their own wicked hearts that did instigate them to so horrid a villany, and then pinch off their flesh from their bones with burning pincers, and pull their four quarters asunder with wild horses, and make their names as hateful as themselves, banish their parents, and make their houses a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual dunghil, in example of <hi>Henry</hi> IV. of <hi>France,</hi> and for an everlasting pattern to all King-killers unto the end of the world.</p>
            <p>And this is all that our <hi>Nibler</hi> at History gets hitherto by his sly insinuations, and indigested impertinencies in the behalf of his minions.</p>
            <p>Now let us proceed and follow him to his next instance, for I am resolv'd I'll take a brush with all the Butt-ends in his book, if't be but for curiosity, to try the metal of this vapouring Huff; as well as to prove what metal his weapon is made of.</p>

            <p>Go say thy Prayers <hi>Greg.</hi> and tremble at the rod that is coming upon thee, except thou thinkest the wisest way, in brief, is some way or other to save the Hang-man a labour, and so be as insensible of the blows that are coming upon thee, as is <hi>thine old Masters</hi> head, <hi>Bradshaw</hi>'s or <hi>Father Grey-beard</hi>'s, (your name-sake, as well as Fellow-sinner's) heads, when the <hi>Jack-daws</hi> sh—upon them: and be thankful likewise that thou hast e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scap'd <hi>my fingers</hi> too, whose <hi>Dexterity</hi> in flashing, more than any of the former Pedants, to your smart, you may yet further feel, when you give me far less provocation, than

            <p>I tell you true, I do not think it was worth your while, to go so far as <hi>France,</hi> nay as <hi>Italy,</hi> for a sample of a King that had <hi>a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemans memory,</hi> and could not so much as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that ever his father was murthered; our King-killers, for whom you plead so heartily, might have made better escape, if you had never gone beyond Sea, to find out Kings to be for the murtherers of a King, Royal <hi>Advocates, viz.

<pb n="198" facs="tcp:94128:105"/>
with a new Law against the Fanaticks. And this is that which of late years hath caused such <hi>a Superfetation of Acts</hi> about the same business.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Modern Orthodoxy still; <hi>tooth and nail,</hi> fly at <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament;</hi> all, dead and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, that have a hand, or has had an hand in the <hi>Act of Uniformity,</hi> that <hi>bane of the Good Old Cause,</hi> but quite desperate by the <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetation-Acts,</hi> about the same business.</p>
            <p>But this is no laughing matter, that which does <hi>tickle</hi> me spite of my teeth, is the word: the <hi>new coin'd</hi> word, by <hi>Greg.</hi> his own self, minted, is <hi>Trinkle; trinkle with the members</hi> of the Parliament; some <hi>of the Fathers of the Church, when his Majesty hath had the most ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent occasions for supply, did make it their busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness to</hi> Trinkle, <hi>to trinkle with the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers—</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I wish for all that <hi>Greg.</hi> had not said trinkle, <hi>Trinkle?</hi> it does so run in my mind like a new tune, that I cannot write one jot more till I have eas'd my hypochondriack sides, and laugh'd at this same <hi>Trinkle</hi> a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, with my little Droll:</p>

            <p>Have you never a little Clergy-man here, for a Gentleman to play with? never a <hi>Droll,</hi> or <hi>boon</hi> companion with a <hi>Cassock</hi> on? that forgetting his <hi>serious office,</hi> will <hi>make</hi> a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman <hi>merry,</hi> &amp; rather than fail, with a Joque upon Scriptures make a <hi>little Play?</hi> that I may pass upon him once or twice: and with a <hi>lucky hit,</hi> (or as he phrases it, <hi>p.</hi> 312. with an unlucky Repartee,) jear the Parson, make him a scorn, a tail and contempt to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>His words there are; But <hi>his,</hi> (the <hi>Eccles-Politician</hi>'s) <hi>zeal spends it self against</hi> the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theists,</hi> because they use to jear Parsons. <hi>That they may do, and no Atheists neither. For really, while Clergy-men will, having so serious an office, play the Drolls and Boon Companions, and make merry with the Scriptures, not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselves,</hi> (who neither having Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rukes on their heads, nor Swingers, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partees at their tongues end cannot possibly be Gentlemen) <hi>but in Gentlemens company, 'tis impossible but that they should meet with, at least,</hi> (if not a swinger and a rapper two or three, yet) <hi>an unlucky Repariee</hi> (oh! I
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:94128:107"/>
thought it would come) <hi>sometimes, and grow by degrees to be a tale and contempt to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:</hi> (or as it is in the Original <hi>Our people,</hi> namely, the <hi>modern</hi> Orthodox do make themselves a taile of an <hi>old</hi> Orthodox Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine.</p>
            <p>And (p. 314.) <hi>I know not by what fate every day one or other of the Clergy does, or saith, some so ridiculous or foolish thing, or some so pretty accident befals them, that (in our Authors words) a man must be very splenetick that can refrain from laughter,</hi> (it should have been quite contrary, A man must not be very splenetick that can refrain from laughter, for <hi>Splen ridet—</hi>It is the seat of laughter, always while you live, so much <hi>spleen,</hi> so much <hi>laugh.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it would make a man laugh spite of his teeth: (though he had scarce any laugh to spare) at what? <hi>To see how every day one or other of the Clergy does or saith, or some accident befals him, that a body can't c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            </p>
            <p>Thus the Tassil-gentle, once upon the wing, for lack of a Heron, or some noble prey, rather than fail, makes a stoop at a Jack-daw, or a Mag-pye.</p>
            <p>'Tis a merry world with <hi>Greg.</hi> he says, <hi>every day</hi> some <hi>one or other</hi> of the Clergy <hi>(ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by word,</hi> or deed done by him, or done
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:94128:108"/>
upon him) is as good to <hi>Greg.</hi> as <hi>Jack-pudding</hi> himself, or <hi>Wild,</hi> or Merry <hi>Andrew</hi> to make him laugh.</p>
            <p>When will't come to my <hi>turn</hi> (think I) <hi>to wait,</hi> and make the Gentleman sport? I am afraid he will not like my <hi>Droll,</hi> I shall ne'er please him; or if he do laugh, I shall, with some unlucky repartee, make him laugh but on one side of his mouth.</p>
            <p>Let me see; give me mine Almanack: since that <hi>Greg.</hi> has his <hi>every day</hi> sport (and laughing, and jesting at one or other of the Clergy) How long will it be before it comes to my turn?</p>
            <p>For you know, my dear friend, <hi>Father-gray-beard</hi> will find no great comfort in me, exc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Indeed I am none of <hi>these</hi> merry Greeks; I can neither <hi>pergraecari,</hi> nor laugh now; I'm not in the humour; they only can best laugh that win.</p>
            <p>But I must be serious, and mind the great business in hand, to see when it will come to my turn to wait upon <hi>Father-grey beard,</hi> as one of the Clergy to make him laugh.</p>
            <p>Let's count. <hi>Every day?</hi> How many days
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:94128:108"/>
is there in a year? Ask <hi>poor Robin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>According to the <list>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Well then; 366 days in a year, and above 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>000 Parishes in <hi>England;</hi> of which I have but just four Parishes, neither more nor less. How long then will it be before my turn comes for one or other of these four Parishes to make sport for <hi>Greg.</hi> and make him laugh, who is <hi>not one day</hi> without the company <hi>of one or other Chaplain</hi> (new as the day) to say grace for him, and make him laugh? At a venture, I'l say, it will not come to my turn (to <hi>tickle</hi> and <hi>trinkle</hi> him till he laugh again) above once a year, and to the most of the Clergy (who have but one Parish) once in four years.</p>
            <p>Now what great <hi>Marvail</hi> is all this, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to the Clergy, that every one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them, (some once a year, and some of them (of the most wary and poorer sort, that have but one Living, and that scarcely a Living neither) once in four pears) <hi>does</hi> or <hi>saith,</hi> or at least some <hi>accident befals</hi> him or them, that a merry man and full of <hi>spleen</hi> (sure he means a <hi>Phanatick)</hi> cannot <hi>hold from laughing?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:94128:109"/>
Nay, if there were a whole thousand of Clergy-men so ridiculous, that once in a year, or at least once in four years, did do such a ridiculous action, or else spoke such a ridiculous word, or (at least) some gave him a twitch by the Girdle, or some other sad accident befel him, that might make a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman laugh;</p>
            <p>Why are all the rest of the eleven thousand Clergy-men thereby any more blemish'd and made contemptible, than were the eleven Apostles for one <hi>Judas?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or, than all, All the Lords, Parliament-men, Gentlemen and Tradesmen, because a certain Lord, (he shall be nameless) and a certain Parliament-man, (I name none) or a certain Gentleman, and also fourthly, and lastly, a certain Citizen, that either <hi>did</hi> or <hi>said,</hi> or else some accident befel him or them, or at least befel the wife of him, or one of them, so ludicrously and ridiculously; that a man (merrily dispos'd) could not but laugh, as if he had seen a pair of Horns up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the head of him, or them, or one of them, (a sad accident!) or, that a certain Lord, Parliament-man, Gentleman (I forgot to say the Knight) or Citizen with his Pery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wig off; either pluck'd off, or struck off, or box'd off, or fourthly and lastly (by some other sad accident) fallen off.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:94128:109"/>
Now what a blot in the Scutcheon would this be, to all the Lords, Parliament men, Gentlemen and Citizens in <hi>England?</hi> if <hi>Greg.</hi> was their Adversary, or should come to be <hi>Garter</hi> King at Arms?</p>
            <p>Oh! yes, a very great blot and blurr to Honour and Reputation; of which the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of <hi>England</hi> are so tender, that 'tis two to one, if <hi>Greg.</hi> had not ten thousand Gloves sent him, all left-handed; if he had dared thus to confront persons of Quality, and men of Honour.</p>
            <p>But to put the affront upon the Clergy, great and small, poor and rich, long &amp; short Gowns, Lawn Sleeves, or no Sleeves, Cassocks silk or Cassocks thread-bare, from the Ordinary, to the Rector, Vicar or poor Curate, from the silk Girdle with four Livings, to the worsted Girdle with poor one Living, 'tis all one to <hi>Greg.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He dares all, slights all, jears all, nay huffs, and struts, stands a tip-toe, and looks big; shakes his Perywig, and stamps, scolds, rails, swells, frets, and rages like a profess'd <hi>Hec.</hi> at all of them, as a pack of puny Gown-men, a Pen and Ink-horn-crew, a sort of spiritless and cowhearted milk-sops, dastards and white-livers, and dare not send a Gentleman the length of their sword.</p>
            <p>Excepting this, there's nothing tends to
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:94128:110"/>
the contempt of the Clergy in his whole relation and invectives, any more than what, changing the name, may with as much ease and unavoidably make a thrust at Reputation of Lord, Parliament man, Gentleman or Citizen.</p>
            <p>Some one or other of the Clergy, nay a thousand of them may be black; and yet both the Church-men and the Church continue comely.</p>
            <p>I wish indeed, with all my heart, that all the whole company of Divines in <hi>England,</hi> were a Divine company: I wish that the Clergy, and all other men, (of what quality soever) were without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing; that might tempt either a light heart to laugh, or a good heart to weep.</p>
            <p>But though I so pray, I have no cause to believe it will be so; or any great ground for hope that it ever shall be so, whilst we are mortal, although Modern Orthodoxy and <hi>Hugh Peter</hi> should be rediviv'd.</p>

            <p>Yet we may say, as of weeds, they do more harm than good in the Garden of God, they make the way of Truth to be evil spoken of, and stain the Surplice they wear.</p>

            <p>They therefore that <hi>tread in high places,</hi> had need look to their <hi>steps,</hi> that they <hi>walk uprightly,</hi> especially when they have many followers and dependents; lest they be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to other mens fall, as well as princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to their own.</p>
            <p>As the due place of the Clergy sets them above many others, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 12. so should they be more eminent than others in Learning and Piety; Gods high Priest of old had Pomegranates for smell, as well as Bells for sound.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Solomon</hi> the Preacher call, himself <hi>Koheloth,</hi> the Preacheress, of the feminine gender; and Preachers are called wisdoms Maids, <hi>Prov</hi> 9. 3. And the Apostles are called <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 29. Christs <hi>Nymphs,</hi> to teach the Clergy purity, as Virgins.</p>
            <p>The longer their Gowns and Robes are, the more apt to contract dirt, and therefore the more carefully to be holden up; lewdness in a Virgin is insufferable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Epicurism</hi> and <hi>Libertinism</hi> prevail'd in the World, not for the goodness of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, but because of the sober and austere
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:94128:113"/>
life of the Doctor that brought it, <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I am confident that rebellion and schism (which is <hi>factions libertinism)</hi> had never prevail'd so far in the hearts of the people of <hi>England,</hi> against so righteous a King and Laws; but for the austerity of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the most vile incendiaries, and the loosness and remissness of others, who went not so steddily, though walking upon better ground.</p>
            <p>Thus you see, my friend, I am not possest with a spirit of contradiction, right or wrong to oppose all that <hi>Greg.</hi> does say; I can be content to accept truth, even when it comes from the father of lyes: and all I have now writ toyou, upon this occasion given me by <hi>Greg.</hi> is only out of my hearty well wishes to the Clergy, that the enemy (by standing on their ground) may have no advantage over them; for <hi>we are not ignorant of his devices;</hi> endeavouring to foyl, and always twitting a good cause, where he finds the least resistance and defence.</p>
            <p>Though in the greatest latitude of Charity, no man can imagine that <hi>Father-Gray-beard</hi> exposes the loosness of any of the Clergy, for any love he has to a more strict conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, either in himself or them.</p>
            <p>That which is most admirable in the man
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:94128:113"/>
is the pregnancy of his fancy in only one Art; to wit, the <hi>superfetation</hi> of wit in all the kinds of railing; the worst Butter-whore is to seek, and may well go to school to <hi>Trinkles,</hi> he and she both being so sertile, sure the brood they ingender will all be Marvelous railers.</p>
            <p>With what exuberancy of stile and variety of invectives does he prosecute the Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Politician, Bishop <hi>Bramhall,</hi> Arch-bishop <hi>Usher,</hi> Bishop <hi>Sparrow,</hi> Bishop <hi>Andrews</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased, Arch bishop <hi>Laud</hi> deceased, King <hi>Charles</hi> deceased; with many sinister reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon his gracious Majesty and this happy Parliament?</p>
            <p>How falsly does he charge the Church of <hi>England,</hi> when he says it admits none to Baptism without the sign of the Cross? whereas the sign of the Cross is not the Cross in Baptism by her Constitutions: But the Cross after Baptism, when the God-fathers and God-mothers vouch for the visibility of the Childs profession and education in Christ's Religion; and is a practice as ancient as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent amongst Christians, who, being scofft by the Heathens for believing in Christ, crucified on a Cross, they did ever since the Apostles time thereby testifie, and openly, and couragiously justifie to the World, that they were no <hi>Gnosticks,</hi> but like St. <hi>Paul, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed</hi>
               <pb n="216" facs="tcp:94128:114"/>
               <hi>of the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whereas he makes it such a horrid thing to keep men from the other Sacrament of Christ, <hi>viz.</hi> the Lords Supper, because they will not kneel and stoop to a Ceremony; let him know they do justly and warrantably in so doing, granting there is such an Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Law, and Ordinance for the same: which ought to be, lest men left to their liberty, some would out of novelty, singula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity or capriciousness, loll, or lye upon the ground, in unseemly, if not in immodest po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures, and consequently tempt some to <hi>abhorr the offering of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whether we stand, or keep walking all the time, as many <hi>Calvinists</hi> do, or sit, as do <hi>some other Calvinists,</hi> or kneel, as do the English Protestants, one is as warrantable as the other, and all alike; and all unlike to the posture of our Saviour at the Institution of it; if he lean'd his head upon St. <hi>Johns</hi> Breast, as he did at Supper; which yet cannot be prov'd, that <hi>that</hi> posture of Discumbency was his posture at the celebration of this Sacrament.</p>
            <p>But much more credit had it been to Trin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles, and much more good had he done in his generation, if instead of <hi>hollaing</hi> and <hi>whooping</hi> against the Ecclesiastical Politician, he had been <hi>hollaing</hi> and <hi>whooping</hi> his Dogs,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:94128:114"/>
his Hogs, his Geese, or his Sheep; and leave discourses of Divinity and Policy, and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures upon the Doctrine and Fathers of our Church, King and Parliament, to men of greater abilities, and more modesty; greater reading, and better parts: Or, if his antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy be great (as it seems to be) to all Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen, forgetting his Father; let him, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sacraments, learn of that almost match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Pen of Sir <hi>William Morrice,</hi> in his <hi>Coena quasi</hi>

<pb n="218" facs="tcp:94128:115"/>
groanings, noise, clamours and whinings, which would be convenient for a deaf man to hear: And likewise in thumping the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, and there traversing all the whole postures of a Master of Fence, and has frighted some (that used to sit near the Pulpit) from their feats, being so often menaced with visage grim and fierce, and Bible heav'd up, lest at last <hi>they should be knockt on the head,</hi> with <hi>Geneva</hi> and <hi>Knox.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And truly at this taking Oratory they are old excellent, and for this alone cryed up and followed by the rabble, in as great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes as <hi>Jack-pudding</hi> himself has about him at a Fair.</p>
            <p>And though I know not one knowing man of Quality in <hi>England,</hi> that is a Phana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, (except upon design, as a crafty Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank companies, and playes the fool with his own <hi>Jack,)</hi> so the rabble and multitude are generally as much pleased with one of these <hi>Phanatick Jack-puddings,</hi> and part with their monies as freely to them, and flock about them in droves, as great and numerous about them, as about <hi>Merry Andrew</hi> or Poet <hi>Wild.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And they'l follow this foolery, till their pocket's emptied and pickt pretty often, and the jest grow stale, (as indeed it is very sowre

            <p>Though to all but Fools and Knaves, it is <hi>such a Text</hi> for Loyalty and Allegiance, such a Text for the King and Cavaleers; that Almighty God has not furnish'd us with such another in the whole Bible:</p>
            <p>Yet these villains could turn it to the quite contrary sence, wresting the holy word of God by their Interpretation, as blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously as atheistically; for they were not all of them so besotted, but they could not but know that they <hi>did lie to the Holy Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I confess indeed there are abundance of Texts, besides the fifth Commandment, that plead for Allegiance and Loyalty, but none like this of <hi>Curse ye Meroz—</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="220" facs="tcp:94128:116"/>
Other Texts require us not to think evil, nor speak evil of Dignities, much more not to entreat them evilly; <hi>For who can lift up his hand against the Lord's Anointed and be guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less?</hi> Though the Lord's Anoynted be as wicked as <hi>Nero</hi> or <hi>Saul,</hi> and have a Devil in him as King <hi>Saul</hi> had; yet we must not be so devilish as to lift up our hands against him. <hi>David,</hi> that did not cut off King <hi>Saul</hi>'s head, yet his heart smote him, and his conscience <hi>smote him</hi> for <hi>cutting off Saul's skirt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this Text<hi>—Curse ye Meroz—</hi>denounces a heavy Curse—not only as other Texts do for rebelling against the King and taking up arms against him, and sending in money and plate to the Rebels to comfort the hearts and bowels of Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors;—</p>
            <p>But here they are by <hi>the Angel of the Lord accursed,</hi> that <hi>like Meroz</hi> sit at home, and will neither come nor send in their Horse and Arms, and Monies to the help of the Chief Magistrate and Chief Judge of the Land, as <hi>Deborah</hi> then was; and <hi>Meroz</hi> was accursed by the Angel of the Lord for not coming to help her against her mighty enemies: Where note too, that the <hi>helping thus</hi> the Chief Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, (as <hi>Deborah</hi> was) is called helping of God, or the <hi>help of the Lord.</hi>

            <p>No man that has his wits about him, or
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:94128:116"/>

            <p>Nevertheless (he say there) <hi>that Text of Scripture will scarce admit it.</hi> And though we know by that what true affection he bears to the King, (against whom who rebels, rebels against God; We have sinned against <hi>Moses</hi> and against thee, say the People; for the sin of Mutiny and Rebellion immediately against <hi>Moses</hi> is acknowledged Rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God) so that <hi>that evasion</hi> will ease the tender consciences of no Rebels, but such of the Modern Orthodox, like <hi>Father Gray-beard,</hi> that thus mince it: as <hi>R.

But let <hi>J. O.</hi> and <hi>R.

            </p>
            <p>I know I had better have stirr'd in a Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets nest, than thus to fret and anger the Modern Orthodox, the Leven of whose Religion makes them waspish, peevish, touchy, clamorous, and malicious slanderers and backbiters; But I am as much above the reach of their malice, as above their low and base Principles, and unmanlike as well as ignoble and effeminate Practices.</p>
            <p>Answering a man's Arguments with a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel upon his Person, and clapping upon him such a beastly character, (as did the Heathens when they arrayed the Christians in Bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skins) on purpose to set their dogs at them;

according to their keeness either to bite or barke.</p>
            <p>Let them oppose the strength of my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments and reasonings with answerable skill and force, and then the danger is over as soon as it appears, though the <hi>Cabala</hi> club for the shot; as the whole Assembly of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines did six years together with joynt and united forces, to make only at last a Catechism for little children, when <hi>Ball</hi>'s Catechism new printed had done the feat much better.</p>
            <p>These are brave fellows, for whose sakes the Government and Laws must give place, and bow which way they please.</p>
            <p>I know wise men know them well enough, but because some look upon these <hi>Demagogues</hi> and Incendiaries, as the great Lights and Luminaries against Ignorance and Atheism, (as <hi>Greg.</hi> suggests, <hi>p.</hi> 313.) i'le but draw the picture of one of them in the pulpit, and barely represent the words that a thousand witnesses yet alive are ready to depose unto, as the very language of the Pulpit, of <hi>Hugh Peters</hi> particularly, when they gull'd the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of their souls, bodies, money, arms and plate, by their damnable doctrine from that blessed Text, Judg. 5. 23.<hi>—Curse ye Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roz.—</hi>

            <p>It had been happy for <hi>England,</hi> the King, Parliament, people and themselves too, if

they never had preach'd, nor ever should be suffer'd to preach on any other Text, than <hi>Matt.</hi> 7. 12.</p>
            <p>And because their Pulpit Buffonery on so sacred a Text, as<hi>—Curse ye Meroz—</hi>was all drolling stuffe, I have suffered my Muse to make use of her Rhime, but not her Fancy in this Pourtraicture; in which I can plead no propriety other than the Chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger does in the villanies of <hi>Wat Tyler</hi> or <hi>Jack Straw,</hi> the bare Historical relation.</p>
            <p>I neither have nor can claim any right or share to this representation and interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that sacred Text, nor this following Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>The Historical relation and dress is mine own, but the Buffoonery is well known to be the Pulpit stuffe of <hi>Hugh Peters</hi> in many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, thwack'd full all the Kingdome over, to listen to that prophane <hi>Hocus,</hi> and paid him well for his pains.</p>

            <p>Was the holy <hi>word of God</hi> ever before in any age or Kingdom so vilely abus'd by such abominable wrestings and interpretations, and to such base and bloody ends and designs, as by these <hi>Peters, Owens, Marshals, Baxters,</hi> &amp;c. are not these <hi>worthy cares for the Fathers</hi> of the new <hi>Church</hi> of modern Orthodoxy? are not these within an inch and a half at least as bad as a <hi>Rationale</hi> upon the sacred Common-Prayer? could the Devil of hell e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver abuse and wrest the Holy Scriptures, as these <hi>modern Orthodox:</hi> juglers and <hi>Sermon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers</hi> have done? nay, the Devil to give him his due, was not so impudent, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>For though he was Devil for taking the sacred word into his mouth, since he hated to be reformed; yet <hi>those</hi> Sermon mongers in these times were much more Devils in that

            <p>Presently I think with my self, if these be the people of God, <hi>who the Devil</hi> will have for his people, I cannot tell; for in all my travails upon earth, I never met with such <hi>villains and wretches</hi> amongst <hi>Turks</hi> or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians;</hi> praying, as the <hi>Indian</hi> did, (when the <hi>Friar</hi> told him to what place after this life the bloody <hi>Spaniard</hi> went) that my soul may never go to that place, whither those bloody

            <p>Yet for my part, in the most impartial scrutiny, that I can make, I do not perceive that these <hi>Modern Faux's</hi> had their <hi>Vizors</hi> truly on, when they went about those deeds of darkness; I do not find that their way of Sermons, Prayers, Jewish Sabbathizings deserves so much Honour as to be called the true face, form, mask, vizor, or resemblance of Religion; it is so far from <hi>true,</hi> that it is not so much as <hi>like the true</hi> way of godliness, and Gospel discoveries by Christ and his Apostles.</p>
            <p>First for their way of Sermons, Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, two, three, four or ten times a week,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:94128:125"/>
the running of an hourg-lass or two at a time, in Lectures on Sundays and week days, Lectures in the morning, Lectures at noon, and afternoon, Lectures, Lectures, Sermons, Sermons, Oh Sermons! I am sure it is not a Gospel way, nor so much as the true face, form or semblance of the preaching of our Saviour and the Apostles.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour in his first Sermon upon the Mount in the 5, 6, and 7 Chapters of S. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> all not half an hour long, yet speaketh of twenty or fourty several subjects: not confining himself to <hi>one</hi> subject, <hi>one</hi> Text, Doctrines, Inferences and Uses, but thought he should not need to beg pardon, though he went from one subject in discourse to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a Random nature; which our <hi>modern Divinity men</hi> would have call'd <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>mbling,</hi> at least; and 'tis well if it scap'd so; our Blessed <hi>Saviour</hi> speaking what was most useful and seasonable for his auditory at that time, and more than ever he spake at any other time, in <hi>one continued</hi> discourse.</p>
            <p>To say that <hi>all</hi> his Sermons are not set down, is bold, impudent, precarious, and daring: the Apostle <hi>John</hi> saith, the <hi>signs</hi> or miracles he <hi>did are not all set down,</hi> but for his words as they were <hi>all</hi> saving, so we have cause to think he did <hi>not grutch them</hi> to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity; for certainly novelty in religious
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:94128:125"/>
worship and variety was not <hi>then</hi> in fashion, he preach'd and so did the Apostles the best that they could, and the best that could be; and if they had not preach'd the same things over and over, over and over again, they must have preach'd one time better than another; which is not safe to say of our Saviour; therefore when his Disciples desire him <hi>to teach them to pray,</hi> he tells them no other but what he had told them in his first Sermon, <hi>when ye pray, s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>y, Our Father,</hi> &amp;c. And when he was in his <hi>Agony, and prayed most earnestly, the third time,</hi> it was short not like the Pharisees, nor <hi>our modern</hi> Pharisees, but to the purpose, and saying <hi>the same</hi> words, the same words—</p>
            <p>Our Saviour never took a <hi>Text</hi> but once, and then the <hi>Sermon</hi> he made of it was not so <hi>long</hi> as the <hi>Text.</hi> S. <hi>Peter</hi> converts three thousand with a Sermon, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. And all the whole Sermon was but <hi>half a Chapter,</hi> and yet <hi>the longest</hi> that <hi>ever</hi> he made; <hi>that</hi> in the tenth Chapter of the <hi>Acts</hi> was scarcely half so long. I might give many more instances to shew that this <hi>way of Sermons</hi> that <hi>now</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and is <hi>the fashion,</hi> is <hi>not</hi> the <hi>way of Christ,</hi> if this was <hi>intended</hi> for a <hi>set-discourse,</hi> for <hi>that</hi> purpose; but I mention it now <hi>only</hi> to shew that these Sermons, Sermons, Lectures, Preachings, as <hi>they</hi> that <hi>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

and cryed <hi>them up,</hi> have been and <hi>still</hi> are the <hi>greatest</hi> villains, cheats, treacherous, deceivers 'under the Cope of Heaven; so <hi>it</hi> does but still evidence the more that <hi>it is not</hi> the way of Christ; brought into the Churuch by two or three <hi>talking men</hi> some hundred of years after Christ, but <hi>they</hi> shall be nameless; it is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to say they could talk well, and they lov'd as all good Orators do, to <hi>hear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves talk;</hi> but that this should be any argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that <hi>now therefore</hi> we must, (let the weather be never so cold,) <hi>sit it out</hi> forsooth, till an <hi>impertinent idle prating fellow</hi> has brought down <hi>Moon, Stars</hi> and <hi>Glories</hi> to shew us how hard he studied the week before for this Hour-glass-Harangue, seems to me <hi>very strange,</hi> that the world should be so still bejugled; especially these tedious speeches being at best but smil'd at, if not quite laugh'd out of countenance, <hi>where</hi> men speak best, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Parliament House, Councils, Universities, Inns of Court; but the <hi>Pulpit</hi> must be the <hi>last</hi> that will learn more wit and grace; though we pretend <hi>these</hi> are <hi>such Gospel times</hi> too, and will take our Saviour and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles for a pattern.</p>
            <p>When they can infer any thing with more sence than <hi>yet</hi> I have heard, from <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 7. S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>continuing his discourse until Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night,</hi> the <hi>only</hi> objection in the <hi>Bible</hi> against

all that I alleadge, I will give them an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, if they will tell me how many hours of that night <hi>St. Paul</hi> and the Disciples did spend in eating and breaking bread, <hi>v.</hi> 11: and raising up <hi>Eutychus;</hi> and also if they will promise me, (in one thing more) to imitate that Holy Apostle, namely when they preach an hour, two, three, or till mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, or all night, I care not, upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, these <hi>Modern Orthodox</hi> will also <hi>depart from us on the morrow</hi> for ever, to try how much we shall wet our Handkerchiefs, when they tell us, we shall <hi>see their face no more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They would be happy indeed, for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves perhaps, I am sure happy for the Kingdom that has been so unhappy already, occasion'd chiefly by their <hi>sweaty</hi> preaching.</p>
            <p>If they have wit enough, let them answer this, and to purpose too, or else down goes <hi>Bell</hi> and the <hi>Dragon;</hi> but if they answer as insignificantly, as they us'd to preach, when they cast so many long looks upon the <hi>slowly-sliding sands</hi> in the hour-glass; if not angry <hi>shaking</hi> it for its sloath, then will their answers tyre me as much as ever did their Sermons, and that's enough in all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and conscience, and I shall scorn to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour them by taking notice of such <hi>imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If St. <hi>Peter</hi> was alive again, and had not

gone to school to some of these new <hi>Holder-forths,</hi> how would <hi>little Pulpit-man</hi> despise him for preaching <hi>the same, the same,</hi> and <hi>the same</hi> Sermon perpetually, when he could show him for a need three or four hundred or a thousand Harangues in his Budget.</p>
            <p>A wicked, foolish, perverse and hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal generation we live in, when men, nay Ministers rather endeavour to <hi>seem</hi> good Preachers, than <hi>be</hi> good Preachers in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Christ and his Apostles; and not by idle inventions, preferr what is <hi>plausible</hi> before what is <hi>profitable,</hi> rather <hi>pleasing men than God;</hi> therefore <hi>they have their reward:</hi> and have plung'd themselves into perplexities, or into Parson slip-stockins extravagancies; chusing rather impertinencies commended for their variety, only by an idle loose people <hi>given to change,</hi> than to speak often to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, <hi>over and over again,</hi> though never so <hi>necessary, profitable,</hi> and to good purpose.</p>
            <p>Nor will the Clergy ever free themselves and their <hi>Sermons from contempt,</hi> till they follow the Copy and Pattern for preaching set them by Christ and his holy Apostles: and if Priest and people find really and truly that these <hi>Hour-glass discourses</hi> are as uneasie and troublesome, as unprofitable to both; let them learn of their Masters, Christ and the Apostles, and the Primitive Fathers, who

and many more, of the most famous men, of the World, as well as <hi>England,</hi> thought it no disparagement to Catechize, though I can give good reasons, that usually, (as in many places of Christendom at this day) any man may propound a question to the Minister, and desire to be resolv'd, and therefore should the man of God be <hi>able and throughly furnished unto every good work and word,</hi> to give a pertinent and ready an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to such as hearing him, ask'd him questions too, if they pleased, as the Doctors with our Saviour, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 46.</p>
            <p>So that those <hi>worthy cares</hi> of the <hi>Fathers</hi> of Modern Orthodoxy in their <hi>Preachments</hi> has not so much as the face, true form and resemblance of Christ's Sermons; but is a whimsey cryed up so long by themselves, till it has justled Sacraments, Prayers, Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizing quite out of the Church; having not the power of godliness, in that there are no such villains (as I said before) as these <hi>Sermon-mongers</hi> upon the face of the earth, as every body must acknowledge and confess, except themselves, who are always apt to find fault with other men for <hi>superstitious,</hi> when they themselves are the most supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious people, I know, in the world, as I'l show more fully on some other occasion; su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious, (at the best) their <hi>sermonizing</hi> is,

            <p>Nor did the Race or Religion of these <hi>Modern Orthodox</hi> ever come into any King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but they fill'd it with blood and ruine; sad instances whereof we have at home, in <hi>Scotland,</hi> in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany, &amp;c.</hi> deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by their means a hundred leagues to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, in more places than about <hi>Munster;</hi> their desolations and depopulations to be seen at this day, a sad spectacle whereof I have often had, which makes me the more loath their abominations.</p>

            <p>They may be <hi>Calvinists, Father Gray-beards Calvinists,</hi> because they are always <hi>bloody Headsmen,</hi> whereever they have room to strike, and a sword in their hand: But they are <hi>not our Calvinists,</hi> I assure you <hi>Greg.</hi> let

them be <hi>your Calvinists</hi> then, it is pity you should be <hi>parted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for <hi>Calvin</hi>'s being a good Scholar, I doubt you would scarcely be mightily in love with the Jesuits, though they should approve themselves, as many of them have, far better Scholars, that is, men of better parts and better read men, and have shown more schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larship in their Works; and yet I think ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their principles have been as destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to the peace of Kingdoms, even <hi>almost</hi> as <hi>Calvin</hi> himself; called therefore <hi>Lucian,</hi> so meritoriously anagrammatized 100 years before <hi>Father Gray-beard</hi> was born.</p>
            <p>For my part, I hate to undervalue any man's scholarship; but I hate the folly as much of <hi>those</hi> men that argue so ridiculously; that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Calvin</hi> was a good scholar, therefore he could not be a Knave, or as bad as a <hi>Jesuit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This must be <hi>Greg</hi>'s meaning, or else his <hi>scholarship</hi> does not at all vouch his <hi>Divinity:</hi> Perhaps <hi>Greg.</hi> is more acquainted with <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi>'s scholarship than I am; though I think I have seen and read <hi>all his Works;</hi> the <hi>most</hi> famous (the <hi>Calvinists</hi> themselves say) is <hi>his Institutions,</hi> designed for a <hi>Confession of Faith,</hi> the <hi>Adjuster</hi> of Controversies, the <hi>Oracle</hi> of his Followers, and as if pronounc'd <hi>è Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra, unerring Divinity,</hi> and infallible; dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to <hi>that</hi> purpose, to his King (that <hi>once</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Sure this <hi>great Divine</hi> was a <hi>great Prophet,</hi> or rather he knew well, he had laid in <hi>that Book</hi> such grounds <hi>of</hi> and <hi>for</hi> sedition, that his <hi>Followers would with strong hand stretch forth themselves to take vengeance,</hi> and call all this—The hand of the Lord, and <hi>the help of the Lord.—</hi>Curse ye Meroz<hi>—to this,</hi> is but the <hi>second part</hi> of the same tune.</p>
            <p>Some men have had such a Reverence for this same <hi>Calvin,</hi> especially being <hi>dead;</hi> O! <hi>de mortuis nil nisi bonum;</hi> that it has been thought as bad as sacriledge to tell truth of the man.</p>
            <p>No man can have greater Reverence to <hi>urns</hi> than I have; nay though a man die or <hi>be hang'd</hi> for his crimes, yet when the <hi>law is satisfied</hi> all good men <hi>ought to be so;</hi>

that he dares write thus <hi>now;</hi> or that any <hi>loyal</hi> subject of his Majesties should be jolly, laugh, and rejoyce in <hi>Greg</hi>'s Book; God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve his Majesty from <hi>all Modern Orthodox men,</hi> and from all that <hi>have been</hi> Modern Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox men, if they give not <hi>better</hi> proofs of their Repentance and Loyalty, than caressing and joying in <hi>Father Gray-beards,</hi> or any of the race of <hi>John Calvin,</hi> as great a Scholar and Divine as he is.</p>
            <p>The greatest <hi>scholarship</hi> that <hi>John Calvin</hi> has left behind him, as a Testimonial of his Learning or Rhetorick, is, That <hi>his Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> are writ in pretty clean Latine; which sounds no more to me, nor any scholar that I know, as an <hi>argument of learning,</hi> than if they had been writ in clean <hi>French, Welsh,</hi> or <hi>Irish.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One language signifying <hi>no more of scholar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> than another; no, though you add the <hi>admired Greek,</hi> and <hi>ever to be admired Hebrew</hi> (a language that no man alive understands, nor can attain to) into the bargain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Languages</hi> being nothing else but <hi>helps to discourse</hi> with men, or acquaintance with Books, as our occasions, trade or business does require.</p>
            <p>And a <hi>Calves-head</hi> is <hi>still</hi> a Calves-head, though it have a <hi>neat tongue</hi> in it, whether <hi>Latine</hi> Tongue, <hi>Welsh</hi> Tongue, <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue,

               <hi>French</hi> Tongue, <hi>English</hi> Tongue, or <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue; which last though, I say, is not now to be <hi>bad</hi> for love nor money; 'tis utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>lost,</hi> and was so before our Saviour's time; <hi>Mazoreth</hi> it self cannot retreive nor retrench it; nor do we read that the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> that descended in so many <hi>cloven Tongues,</hi> gave the Disciples <hi>one Hebrew</hi> Tongue amongst them <hi>all;</hi> but that's all one to me.</p>
            <p>All that I urge <hi>this</hi> for, is, that <hi>that</hi> clean <hi>Latin</hi> style in which <hi>Calvin's Institutions</hi> is pencill'd, whether by himself or <hi>any other linguist,</hi> it matters not, nor signifies any thing to entitle him or any man else; A <hi>great Scholar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if we may judge of his scholarship by his <hi>Divinity,</hi> 'tis (to say no more) right <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian,</hi> and <hi>Knox</hi> his own self.</p>

               <hi>Eleventhly,</hi> friends, <hi>further</hi> enquire, <hi>How</hi> shall we blacken him? was not the father of this <hi>E.

            <p>
               <hi>Fourteenthly,</hi> enquire <hi>still</hi> I say, friends, I am upon the <hi>use of enquiry,</hi> whether or no, it will not be our wisest course to <hi>sit still,</hi> and never offer at an answer to this Letter from

            <p>Yet <hi>Fifteenthly,</hi> Beloved, since this <hi>E.

               <hi>Sixteenthly,</hi> What think you friends; I only propose it; what think you of making <hi>another Gathering</hi> among the Churches for our friend—The Author of <hi>The Rehearsal Transpros'd,</hi> to chear up his drooping spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, for I hear he is <hi>crop-sick,</hi> and his spirit, like <hi>Nabal</hi>'s, almost <hi>dead within him;</hi> but a little encouragement from you, I only give you my thoughts, would perhaps make him still get some <hi>more Ink and Elbow griese,</hi> and spend it <hi>briskly</hi> once more <hi>in behalf of modern Orthodoxy,</hi> and the <hi>Good Old Cause;</hi> which, though he says, is now <hi>too good to be fought</hi>
               <pb n="270" facs="tcp:94128:141"/>
               <hi>for,</hi> (be not angry at him, friends, for he means no harm <hi>to us,</hi> nor <hi>it,</hi> so long as he does not think it a Cause <hi>too good to be writ for,</hi> so he do but vindicate it the <hi>second</hi> time with his <hi>pen,</hi> we expect no more from <hi>such white-livers;</hi> let <hi>us alone</hi> to vindicate it with the <hi>Pike.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventeenthly,</hi> and lastly, Beloved, <hi>one use</hi> more and I have done, it is an <hi>use of Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;</hi> you have heard what <hi>E. H. has</hi> done in robbing us, and making us <hi>naked and bare;</hi> you have also heard <hi>several enquiries,</hi> what may be thought fit <hi>to be done</hi> in our defence, which I leave, friends, <hi>to your consideration:</hi> which if you think useless, fruitless, goodless, and purposeless; then in the <hi>last place</hi> let me <hi>exhort</hi> you <hi>never to repent</hi> as long as you live, let them say what they will, or laugh their hearts out. <hi>Repent! and recant! that</hi> would be <hi>pretty indeed,</hi> that would be as much as to <hi>confess</hi> this <hi>Indictment,</hi> and acknowledge our selves to have <hi>been guilty</hi> of all the innocent blood shed in these nations, Royal blood and all; and also to acknowledge that brother <hi>Oliver</hi> deceased had no <hi>Right</hi> to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> nor <hi>we</hi> to the <hi>rest</hi> of the <hi>Kings-Lands, Bishops-Lands, Lords-Lands,</hi> &amp; <hi>Gentlemans-Lands,</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questred &amp; sold to <hi>us</hi> in <hi>those happy Gospel times:</hi> the very thoughts <hi>wherof,</hi> (friends, <hi>do you see?)</hi> makes me weep, so that my <hi>eyes dropping</hi> so
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:94128:141"/>
fast, my words can no longer <hi>drop as the rain,</hi> I'll <hi>sob</hi> out a little more though in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of this so <hi>necessary use</hi> of Exhortation, namely, that you would, friends, abhorr <hi>this Book,</hi> or <hi>this Letter,</hi> call it what you will, from <hi>E. H.</hi> so that you abhorr it as much as the <hi>Apocrypha,</hi> or as the <hi>Tabernacle of a Robber,</hi> or as that <hi>lewd womans house</hi> you read of, <hi>avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it,</hi> and <hi>pass away,</hi> for there are <hi>charms</hi> in it, I <hi>speak mine own experiences,</hi> there are charms in <hi>that</hi> Book, that will <hi>force your wills,</hi> ('tis strange!) <hi>to be ruled</hi> by your understandings, (and then <hi>farewel blind zeal</hi> for ever;) &amp; if you do but read and consider what he says, there are charms to make you believe all he says to be true, in spight of your teeth; he has spoil'd us <hi>many a good</hi> Sermon, <hi>wherein</hi> we use to inveigh against the <hi>Cross</hi> in Baptism, and against Baptism of any, until they be <hi>taught,</hi> and against <hi>kneeling</hi> at the Sacrament: having given us a spiteful <hi>Go-by,</hi> which I never heard of before; calling it the <hi>Cross after</hi> Baptism, as if the Church of <hi>England</hi> held Baptism sufficient <hi>without</hi> it, and <hi>before</hi> it be used: and also <hi>denying,</hi> (which we know not how to help,) that Teaching goes before Baptizing in the words of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, asserting that Christ commands his Disciples, to make Disciples by baptizing
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:94128:142"/>
them in the Name of the Father, &amp;c. and then says, in the following verse comes in Teaching, time enough. And then for kneeling at the Sacrament of the Lords Suppper, he says it is as easie to prove it the posture of Christ and his Apostles, as is sitting, lolling, lying, standing or walking; making no matter which, so there be decency and and order, friends; saying there is no more Ceremony in kneeling then, than at any other Devotion; nor more a Ceremony than when the <hi>Quakers</hi> in token of Respect, Love and Reverence when they meet, wring one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the hands; but we know, friends, the <hi>Quakers</hi> are the silliest and most foolish Sect that ever was in the world, for denying all Ceremonies, because it is impossible, whilest we have bodies and are in the flesh, but we must use some posture or other of body, when we are at our Devotions; and one posture is as much a Ceremony as another: and also we must needs be covered with some vests, or vestments, when we are at our Devotions, except we meet naked; at which the women laughing, he concludes.</p>
            <p>Thus have I constrain'd my self thus long into a snivelling Cant, to shew those that never came at a Conventicle, what Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, (I am sure,) will be made of my Letter; though I protest I have not writ a
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:94128:142"/>
syllable in it, whether jest or earnest, but in a sober, true-hearted design for the good of those poor souls, bejugled and cheated of their Estates and more precious souls by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Orthodoxy, carried on to the ruine of Kingdoms by Spiritual Gypsies, Fidlers &amp; Jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers that wander all the Kingdom over, seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whom they may devour and make a prize and booty of; and if I were a Lawyer, I think, I could find Law enough against them, and bring them, for all their shifts &amp; <hi>Legerdemains,</hi> within the compass of the Statutes against Vagrants, Fidlers, Juglers and cheaters, if not Wolves, though in Sheeps cloathing.</p>
            <p>And I have manifested more true love in this Letter to beguiled and unstable souls, than he does that picks their pocket.</p>
            <p>Such I mean, as <hi>Hugh Peters,</hi> of whom they have had as good an opinion, as they now have of any of their precious, godly men, who can scarce hold from laughing, (as <hi>Hugh Peters</hi> did,) to see how soon the poor fools and their moneys were parted.</p>
            <p>Of which precious snivelling, whining chapmen, if any be so fool-hardy as to plead for their <hi>Baal's</hi> and <hi>Diana's,</hi> here defyed; let him but put his name to what he writes, and I'll promise him I'll tell him if he desire it, what <hi>E. H.</hi> (at the end of this Letter subscrib'd) does signifie, and who claims
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:94128:143"/>
that name, which those Letters here stand for; because I'll justifie every word I write; and I would also beg of such an one, (if at least such an one there be, so daring as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend Modern Orthodoxy, whose admirers did use to expose themselves in Print as readily as ridiculously, and as pertly, as malepertly,) that he would place his words, as right as that disorderly scribling Tribe of <hi>Adoniram</hi> use to do; and let me not have one such tempting word, as <hi>Trinkles, Tuants, Un: hoopable</hi> jurisdiction, or <hi>ferreting upon the stage,</hi> and the like to sport with; as he loves me, my ease, my quiet and repose.</p>
            <p>Left complaint be made by those of the Kings and Dukes Play-house, that, for less money, to their great hinderance and want of custom, we entertain men in Afternoons, with our Repartees, till it be grown almost as good as a Play; as Father <hi>Gregory</hi> phrases it <hi>p.</hi> 35. very jocundly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gregory</hi> himself allows a man <hi>once in his life to change his Party, p.</hi> 91. for which I could almost approve one thing he says; and indeed otherwise he would have condemn'd S. <hi>Paul</hi> and all mankind, who are born with their backs heaven-ward; but when he says, they may change sides either for safety or preferment, he discovers the sow, beggarly and ignoble principles that act him; 'tis <hi>Greg.</hi>
               <pb n="275" facs="tcp:94128:143"/>
like, <hi>Gregories</hi> own self, for so he came to be an <hi>executioner,</hi> either <hi>for safety</hi> (to save his own neck from the Gallows) or for <hi>Preferment</hi> to so high an Office.</p>
            <p>Come take my advice <hi>Greg.</hi> learn at last to be more wise, and leave this scribling, to which <hi>your stars</hi> are averse; and because I am in the <hi>counselling</hi> humour, I <hi>also</hi> advise you, (better late thrive than never) abjure this villanous game <hi>Picquet,</hi> which you say, <hi>you but lately learned;</hi> haunt not the company of <hi>Lincoln Dignitaries,</hi> nor those rooking <hi>Ordinaries,</hi> where you say you were <hi>chouc'd when you play'd pieces,</hi> for fear that though you never have grace to repent and return from <hi>Oliverian</hi> Orthodoxy, yet it is <hi>more than an even lay,</hi> that such lewd courses will in spight of your purse, make you a <hi>turn-Coat,</hi> a <hi>Profession</hi> that I was never so needy &amp; thread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare to be of; for my <hi>Buff-coat,</hi> though turn'd two or three times, will scarcely make so neat a Cassock, as I now wear, though the <hi>Kings Taylor</hi> himself take it in hand; <hi>Modern</hi> Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxy, under which I was <hi>born and bred,</hi> and to which I was <hi>childishly</hi> led, being now abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by me, through more <hi>ingenuous</hi> &amp; <hi>generous</hi> principles, than either <hi>safety</hi> or <hi>preferment.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Neither</hi> of which was <hi>either design'd,</hi> obtain'd, or <hi>like to be</hi> obtain'd in <hi>the change</hi> by me, who could, if I had listed to have been <hi>so base,</hi>
               <pb n="276" facs="tcp:94128:144"/>
have <hi>pickt the peoples pockets,</hi> with canting <hi>long snivelling sermons,</hi> as <hi>cleaverly</hi> as the <hi>best</hi> of them, with many <hi>thanks for my great pains</hi> therein, besides <hi>applause and renown</hi> too into the bargain <hi>alive and dead:</hi> whereas the party I own, is of <hi>another Cue,</hi> and Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>design'd</hi> by our noble Ancestors with a liberal hand to men of <hi>most merit,</hi> being <hi>byass'd</hi> many times with <hi>little Picques</hi> and self-interest, run right upon the <hi>Jack,</hi> that if he <hi>paid</hi> not for it before he had it <hi>delivered,</hi> yet paid dearer for it by marrying cousin <hi>Abigail,</hi> or blear-ey'd <hi>Leah</hi> our daughter: whereas <hi>more safety and preferment</hi> (as the Non-<hi>conformists</hi> know well) flowes plentiful upon the <hi>Oliverian Orthodox,</hi> whilst the <hi>truly Orthodox</hi> Clergy fall <hi>into contempt</hi> universal, and by reason of <hi>envy</hi> to some of the <hi>Great Ones,</hi> and <hi>scorn</hi> to such as are too deservedly <hi>despicable</hi> amongst the Clergy, very few men do <hi>cordially</hi> concern themselves therein.</p>
            <p>Enough to <hi>deter</hi> men from those so <hi>little plausible</hi> Truths, which I have own'd in this Letter, with such candor and freedom, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that Primitive Orthodoxy of our Saviour, the Apostles, the Primitive Church, and the present Church of <hi>England,</hi> if they durst speak out, for fear of being houted at with such as <hi>Greg.</hi> and scurrilous companions of <hi>Oliverian</hi> Orthodoxy; who hang toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

            <p>Whilst, on the other hand and party, men are so unconcern'd in any thing but private interest and little picques, that a despised truth may go a begging for all them, let the Church and Truth sink or swim, they'l save one, little considering that neither their private <hi>Cargo</hi>'s nor <hi>themselves</hi> can possibly be safe in a <hi>wrack.</hi>

               <hi>Which</hi> this Kingdom and Church has suffered lately <hi>already</hi> by a rebellion <hi>counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanc'd and vouch'd</hi> by <hi>Gospel-</hi>discoveries, in their <hi>Lectures, Preachments, rash Prayers,</hi> called blasphemously, <hi>gifts of the holy Ghost,</hi> all which I have proved to be <hi>no gifts,</hi> otherwise than as <hi>Physicians</hi> call their Medicines <hi>doses,</hi> gifts; yet men <hi>pay dear</hi> enough for these <hi>doses,</hi> and so have these <hi>doses,</hi> if they be <hi>gifts,</hi> cost these Kingdoms <hi>dear,</hi> even their <hi>best heart blood;</hi> God keep us from <hi>their doses,</hi> and the <hi>Jewish thraldom</hi> of <hi>sabbathizing,</hi> by which Hypocritically and Pharisaically they <hi>impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated</hi> a day from <hi>works of mercy,</hi> that they might have <hi>more leisure</hi> to sell their <hi>doses</hi> or gifts, as they falsly call them, helping them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves at once with <hi>a market day,</hi> on which
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:94128:145"/>
they may <hi>sell at leasure</hi> all their Apostate wares and Impostures; and perhaps sell the <hi>same wares</hi> two or <hi>three</hi> or <hi>four</hi> times on the <hi>same market-day, first</hi> in a Morning Lecture at <hi>one</hi> Chureh, in a <hi>fore-noon</hi> Sermon at <hi>another</hi> Congregation, in an <hi>after-noon Sermon</hi> at <hi>another place;</hi> and then <hi>fourthly and lastly,</hi> a <hi>Crambe Repetition</hi> of the <hi>same</hi> Sermon, though pitiful ware, God knows, as ever cost <hi>so dear,</hi> having <hi>been paid for</hi> dear enough in conscience, at the <hi>first part</hi> of the day, when it was expos'd to sale in the <hi>morning</hi> Lecture.</p>
            <p>And also this <hi>Superstitious Sabbathizing</hi> (though contrary to <hi>all</hi> the reformed Churches in the world, and <hi>all Christendom,</hi> whether they follow the <hi>Greek, Muscovian, Roman, Lutheran,</hi> or <hi>Calvinian</hi> Churches, yet) here in <hi>England</hi> alone admired by these <hi>Modern Orthodox,</hi> partly for their <hi>gain-sake,</hi> partly for <hi>pride-sake,</hi> glorying and braving their betters with that <hi>silly superstitious vizor</hi> of Religion; but making <hi>more damnable</hi> use of it, by <hi>arming the people,</hi> bejuggled with their pretences of <hi>serving the Lord</hi> in their <hi>care of the Lords day</hi> against the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Church,</hi> that (hating to lay <hi>greater yokes &amp; burdens upon the necks of the disciples,</hi> than Christ, the Apostles, Primitive Church and all Christendom does impose) <hi>proclaim'd</hi> that due liberty, to which
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:94128:145"/>
Christ had <hi>set us free</hi> by abolishing that <hi>Type Sabbathical</hi> (both <hi>weekly</hi> and <hi>yearly</hi> Sabbaths) amongst other <hi>hand-writings of Ordinances</hi> Ceremonial <hi>that were against us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet these <hi>Modern Orthodox men,</hi> fairly <hi>pretending for God,</hi> and preaching up <hi>his day,</hi> though <hi>superstitiously</hi> and Ceremoniously, Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishly, Pharisaically and Hypocritically, made the silly people believe all was <hi>gold</hi> that they made to <hi>glister,</hi> and <hi>nothing</hi> could be <hi>supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious</hi> which they <hi>cry'd up,</hi> who used to <hi>cry down</hi> superstition with a filthy <hi>wide</hi> mouth; and <hi>as wide</hi> from Truth, Scripture, Right Reason, as Heaven is from Hell, or Truth from falshood.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Jewish superstitious Sabbathizing</hi> then furnisht them with <hi>one whole day</hi> in a week to <hi>vend their wares,</hi> and get gain; (though afterward their <hi>insatiable</hi> greediness got them <hi>week-day Lectures</hi> too) <hi>also</hi> furnisht them with a <hi>new cloak</hi> of Holiness to cover their knave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, rebellion, jugglings, pride, covetousness and schism; and <hi>also</hi> furnisht them with an <hi>Artillery of men and arms,</hi> with adjutant supplies of money to boot, to fight against the King and Church, and fill the whole Land with blood and ruine, <hi>fighting for super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition under the colours of holiness,</hi> and the Lords day; and all that oppose them herein, must needs be fighters against God, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane.</p>

               <hi>Which opinion</hi> of the people is still <hi>so settled</hi> in them, and so <hi>little hopes</hi> there is, that they will be capable of better information, and so <hi>little thanks</hi> (however) for the pains; <hi>(unpleasant</hi> truths being never <hi>so welcome</hi> as <hi>pleasing errours</hi> and superstitions;) that I <hi>once</hi> resolv'd (with the old <hi>Politick Monk, sinere res vadere vt vadunt)</hi> to let people think and do what they would for all me.</p>
            <p>But when I consider'd the <hi>mischief</hi> that this <hi>Jewish superstition</hi> alone has occasion'd in the Kingdom, and that either King, Church and Kingdom must deny <hi>their own light</hi> and knowledge, and thus <hi>Judaize,</hi> or else there is a <hi>weapon</hi> always at <hi>hand</hi> ready for the Modern Orthodox <hi>plausibly to assault</hi> again our Peace upon all occasions; and till mutiny be ripe, there is in <hi>the interim</hi> a sufficient calumny al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ready, by <hi>way of preparation</hi> thereunto, wherewith to reproach the King and Church as <hi>debauch'd in principles</hi> and practices pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, when if the <hi>truth</hi> was but <hi>known,</hi> and the question determined, the <hi>prophaneness</hi> must lye, where the <hi>superstition</hi> lyes; yet if <hi>Greg.</hi> had not hinted it in reproach to Bishop <hi>Bramhall,</hi> I had not medled with it <hi>now,</hi> though I <hi>bless God</hi> for the occasion, and that he has put so much courage and honesty in my mind, as to study more to get my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men <hi>good,</hi> by <hi>avowing</hi> the Truth, than

               <hi>Do not the Jews at this day make most use of the Hebrew text of the Old Testament?</hi> No. Our Saviour, the Apostles and all the Jews in that time admired most, and made most use of the Septuagint, which was given (say some) by divine Inspiration; however, though the autographical Copy (laid up care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in that famous Library of <hi>Ptolomaeus Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphus,</hi> (who set the 70 to work) when, in <hi>Julius Caesar</hi>'s time (half a hundred years before our Saviours time) was burnt at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria</hi> with all the rest of that glorious Library, yet the Apographical Copies were taken for the most certain and authentick Text of the Old Testament, and therefore quoted upon all occasions by Christ and his Apostles, sometimes in places differing from the Hebrew Text, as we have it, there being thirteen signal variations betwixt them; the Chaldee Paraphrase not then having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd that due credit it now has got; and the <hi>Hierusalem Targum,</hi> invented about 1500

years ago; and the <hi>Megilloth Targum,</hi> not above 1200 years ago, all in <hi>Syriack,</hi> and now generally owned by the Jews, all of them at this day?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But were not the Talmuds both of them writ in Hebrew, the Pharisees saying they were delivered unto</hi> Moses <hi>upon mount Sinai with the Law?</hi> No, They were the Invention of R. <hi>Jehuda,</hi> sirnamed for his holiness, <hi>Hakkadosh;</hi> but in the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Tongue, and as spurious and adulterate rejected by our Saviour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Which do you think is the most Authentick apographical Copy of the Septuagint, the Vati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can or Alexandrian?</hi> Much alike; yet the Alexandrian is usually preferred; we call it the <hi>King's Manuscript,</hi> because it was sent to our King from <hi>Constantinople</hi> by <hi>Cyril Lucaris</hi> Patriarch there, and brought with him as a famous monument from <hi>Alexandria</hi> where he was Patriarch till advanc'd to the higher dignity, the Patriarchat of <hi>Constantinople;</hi> from whence our Leiger Ambassadour there Sir <hi>Thomas Roe</hi> sent it to our King.</p>
            <p>The Greek Church heard of no other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble but this Septuagint 400 years after Christ, when St. <hi>Hierom</hi> first divulg'd com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the Hebrew Text; at which the <hi>African</hi> Bishops, St. <hi>Augustine</hi> especially was so offended, that he interdicted that Hebrew Bible, as did also the Greek Bishops; which

forc'd St. <hi>Hierom l.</hi> 2. <hi>cont. Ruffinum; &amp; in Praf ad</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> to beg their pardon, saying, he had no design by that Promulgation, to confront the sacred Septuagint.</p>
            <p>And for my part, I think (if you will not be angry) that the <hi>Vulgar Latin</hi> is a more certain Interpreter, and as old (I believe) as since the times of the Apostles, being writ by them, or some of their Disciples for the use of the <hi>Church of Rome, to whom St. Paul</hi> writ an Epistle; and even <hi>Beza,</hi> as well as <hi>Grotius</hi> acknowledges it, so much the more credibly authentick for that <hi>old</hi> as well as <hi>odd</hi> Latine in which it gloried, before St. <hi>Hierom's</hi> time.</p>
            <p>For he indeed pretended to amend and correct it by putting forth another Latine Translation, concordant, as to the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with his Hebrew Text, encouraged thereunto by Pope <hi>Damasus,</hi> and both his Latine Version and the old Vulgar Latine were confirmed by <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great: But because they made a distraction in the Church, they were by the Authority as well as pains of <hi>Clement</hi> 8. concorporated, and now are known by the old name; (given before St. <hi>Hierom</hi> was born) The Vulgar Latine: <hi>To which</hi> Learned men I'le assure you give a great deal of Credit and Reverence; therein consenting with <hi>Baronius, Bonfrerius, Serra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>

standing in the University, than Greek accents and aspirations, a new invention too of the Grammarians: yet both of them are of much longer standing, than the distinction of the Holy Books inter Chapters and Verses; which yet are useful, if they be not always too much insisted upon: of all the new Hebrew additions <hi>Dagesch</hi> pleads the greatest seniori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, being as old (some say) as the Letter N.

            </p>
            <p>Truly, truly Generous Sir, I have cut out more and better work for you and all Gospel Ministers, than you are well aware of, or can readily accomplish. though all the shreds and parings, as rubbish be thrown into Hell, except what is included in these six verses; and you shall do your work more profitably and honourably to your selves and the people, if you keep your selves within the limits of those six verses, do as much good as ever you did, and have as much work too, and yet neither do nor say any thing mischievously and impertinently:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="295" facs="tcp:94128:153"/>
For first your conversations (at which the enemy is so scandalized as well as your selves) will be unblameable by doing as you would be done unto; you cannot then chouce poor Gentlemen of their moneys when they play pieces at an Ordinary, this Principle will keep you from cheating tricks, or being cheated; will keep your hands from picking and stealing and defrauding; and your tongues from evil speaking, lying and slande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; why? because you would not willingly be so served by others; but you must by this principle behave your selves <hi>soberly,</hi> in reference to your own bodies in temperance, <hi>righteously</hi> in reference to all other men, by justice, and <hi>godlily</hi> in reference to devotion towards God in duties of Religion and holy worship: which is made up of five particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, namely, Faith, the Seals of Faith, Prayers, Praises and Ceremonies.</p>
            <p>Unto which some adde Swearing: but not well advised therein; For though God Almighty says to his people, <hi>Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God,</hi> Deut. 6. 13. <hi>and serve him, and shalt swear by his name;</hi> yet the last clause is not exegetical of the former; nor do men serve God by swearing; nor is it any part of Heavenly Liturgy, other than as when we serve truth and our generation, being called at Courts of Judicature, to attest truth,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:94128:154"/>
calling God to witness, and to judge us according to the truth of what we averr; and if this be done cordially, it assoils such a man of Atheism, but not of irreligion; if by Religion we mean religious worship; which I say has but five parts, as abovesaid: and all included in my Sermon of six verses.</p>
            <p>Now saith little Modern Orthodox; are you there again with your Clypticks? having neither accepted Sermon nor Lecture into your holy worship? I hope Sermons that have had all the room in the Church, (when your Liturgy, and your Sacraments, and your Ceremonies were turn'd out of doors,) shall yet be taken in for one share, part and portion of religious and holy worship of God.</p>
            <p>No, not a bit, I admit no Sermons, Lectures, Preachments, nor Harangues, no not mine own dear Sermon of six verses to have any part or lot in this matter of religious worship; I know they have turn'd all religious worship out of the house of God, so that now Sermon is taken to be the All of Gods worship and so understood in common phrase; Is there a Sermon this After-noon, or to day? is sermon done? were you at sermon to day? &amp;c. meaning, were you at Church? or serving God to day? sermon, sermon for all; and if no sermon, then there's nothing at all, that
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:94128:154"/>
amongst silly men and women can sound like religious worship.</p>
            <p>Whereas I come and say quite contrary; namely, that Ceremonies, Sacraments, &amp;c. are religious, necessary, and holy worship of God; but Sermons, Lectures and Harangues are not at all the religious and holy worship of God, when they are never so good sermons; but the usual sermons of Modern Orthodox, that justled true and holy worship out of the Church, did not so much as tend to holy wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship consisting in Ceremonies, the Liturgy, Sacraments, &amp;c. those men being so far from preaching up those parts of holy worship, that they preach'd them down, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, the more sermons, and the more eloquent sermons of that nature, were the most devillish works of darkness and Hell, and the more men heard and believed those sermons, the more they were children of wrath and darkness, if so be that those five particulars aforesaid contain all the parts and portions of holy worship; and that sermons, the most admired Preachments be not allowed therein any, (not so much as the least) share; sermons at best being only in order to Gods worship, as they plainly and honestly comment upon, and exhort unto Ceremonies, Faith, Seals of Faith, Prayers and Praises; this ought to be the height of the Ambition
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:94128:155"/>
that sermons can lay claim unto; only to be subservient and serviceable to these high and mighty Devotions, Faith, the seals of Faith, Prayers, Praises and Ceremonies, which three last you have most Evangelically in our Holy Liturgy.</p>
            <p>And all sermons that tend not to the preaching up of these, (how worthy cares soever <hi>Father Grey-beards</hi> do esteem them,) are whimsical and extravagant at best, in relation to instructing people in Holy and Gospel worship: but if those sermons cry down these, or any of these five particulars, established in the Church, then those ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and sermon-mongers are diabolical, schismatical, hypocritical, seditious, false, foolish and Hellish; and such sermons in the Church, are like <hi>Baal,</hi> an Idol in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, and such <hi>Sermon-mongers, Baals Priests.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All whom here I defie in the Name of the Living God, to come out, if they dare try it out with me in this particular, and plead for their <hi>Baal:</hi> so I call those sermons that men have not only made Idols of, but those Idols have been set up in the house of God, ever since <hi>Modern Oliverian Orthodoxy</hi> was set up, and all true and Holy Worship has been quite thrown out of the Church, to make room for this <hi>Baal.</hi>

Not that I (neither) would have the Pulpit thrown out of the Church; since it may be so useful by Exhortations and honest Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions from thence, how men may demean themselves in the holy Worship of God, and in Temperance, and Charity, and Justice towards themselves and others. But still I say, though I allow it a place in the Church, yet only such a place as the Seat of Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Judicature, those judicial Benches you see in some Churches, when Discipline was in fashion; namely, those Benches and the Pulpit are only for Direction, Correction and Instruction, and as much, and more need of the former than the latter; if those Seats and Benches of Discipline were, as they should be, fill'd with honest and able men, not with Salesmen, Brokers and Hucksters. But neither Spiritual Courts, nor Sermons, neither Discipline nor Doctrine are any parts of the holy Worship of God; though by reason of men's infirmities, they have, like Physick to the Body, or Laws to a Nation, been found useful, when well manag'd: But still, they are happiest people that need fewest Laws, and the healthiest people that need the least Physick, and the holiest and wisest peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that need the least Doctrine or Discipline, Sermons or spiritual Courts.</p>
            <p>Both which, I confess, have prov'd pretty
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:94128:156"/>
gainful Trades, as some have gone to work, to the peoples great loss, as well as great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement and reproach to them; there being no greater sign of a Dunce, than that he is taught, and taught, and taught his Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son over and over again, and yet can never say it, take forth, or turn a new leaf; <hi>ever learning but never able to come to the knowledge of the truth,</hi> as those silly women St. <hi>Paul</hi> chastises, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 6, 7. But that our men should be so silly too, they may be ashamed of their dull pates, if they have any shame in them. Besides, like Blockheads and ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thriven lean Jades, they also shame their Keepers, Teachers and Masters, who, if they had the right art of teaching, could not but make better Scholars.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the hypocritical Oliverian Crew will think I speak against Hour-glass Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons out of a lazy self-interesting Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, owning here plain and short Pulpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talk, thereby to vouch my own negligence and sloth.</p>
            <p>Let them think so still, I care not: but though they think my Sermons too short, I'le make them amends in another bargain. I am sure they think my Writings and this Letter (in particular) long enough; if they do not, perhaps they will think so upon the next oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion they give me to hold forth against them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="301" facs="tcp:94128:156"/>
Besides, my Sermons are not Hour-glass Sermons; for I give order to my Clark and Sexton to turn the Hour-glass in their Pew, that a great quantity of the sand may be run out, (under the Rose be it spoken) before they set it up in view upon my first approach to the ever-to-be-adored Pulpit; chusing rather to whet than dull the appetites of my hearers, and leave them rather a longing for more, than cloy their affections with tedious stuff: 'tis healthful at such meals to rise with an appetite.</p>
            <p>And indeed I and my Auditory are pretty well agreed for that matter; most of them (I hope) having not so ill been taught, or so learned Christ, but that they had rather be good than seem good: and so they have but the Worship of God (in our sacred Liturgy) to the full, they are more indifferent for those Pulpit after-drops; of which yet they have not been scanted, nor have they wanted any of their due and wonted measure, this fortnight that I have spent in this Letter, more troublesome to my <hi>Amanuensis</hi> than my self; costing more pains and time in the Printing and Press than in the Composure.</p>
            <p>However, my Congregation, for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of them judge not the worth of a Sermon by the Quantity but Quality thereof; an ounce of meat being worth a pound of
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:94128:157"/>
poyson, as much as an ounce of Gold is worth a pound of dull Lead: chusing rather to have a profitable and plain Sermon, though short, than an impertinent story antiquely told, though never so long; they coming not to Church to see Tumbling tricks and Hocus juglings, with Cloak hung by, Buttons scracht ope, Hands heav'd up, with wide open Mouth and Cheveril Lungs, with Teeth bitingly set and grinning, with such apish <hi>Peters, Rogers, Dedham-</hi>Jack-Pudding Tricks; willing to leave those to modern Pharisees, Sermon-mongers, Hypocrites and Oliverian-Orthodox, the Head and Body of whose Religion is made up like a dismal Monster, in which nothing appears eminent but sowcing great Luggs and a Mouth greater, without Brains, and without any Face like true Religion; and if the Devil did not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess men strangely, with greedy Covetousness, Pride, Blood and Singularity, no man could be in love with it.</p>
            <p>But if any of these Mad-caps will be so hardy, as to venture a fall or foil in behalf of their monstrous Mistress of modern Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verian Orthodoxy; and undertake against me, to prove that she has a portion and share in religious and holy Worship; and also endeavor to prove that she has decent Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, if she be not a Beauty, and has more
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:94128:157"/>
eminent and protuberant parts than Mouth and Ears, let him come out as soon as he will; for her credit and his, and all the credits of <hi>good Old Cause</hi> men, lie desperately in jeopardy and at hazard. Therefore the sooner they shew their courage and strength the better it will be for them, and not much the worse for me; now my hand is in, I long to try again what metal they are made of, or where their great <hi>Sampson</hi>'s-strength lies, which Fops only admire: For we never could find yet that their strength lay in their Brains or any Excrement that their Brains put forth or hitherto produc'd. Their Talent lies in chucking the white and blew Aprons; and if the Husband be Novice enough to be cullied into the bargain, there's so much sav'd: but if he be too crafty, like a cunning old Bird, that will not be catch'd with such Chaff; in that Case it is lawful for the dear heart his Wife to filch religiously, and cheat her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band for God's sake.</p>
            <p>And so let them address to Petticoat, that's the height they can goe, and plot how to make their approaches to her Pocket; and for the great pains of Brother <hi>Precious</hi> therein get a <hi>Maudlin Courtsee,</hi> and thanks, very lovingly, with great Cake and Posset too, over and above; mouthing in conclusion most savourly with <hi>Hopkins</hi> and <hi>Sternhold,</hi>

which, in modern Gypsee-cant, sounds<hi>—Loth to depart.</hi>

            <p>These are worthy cares for those Fathers, (so called in good earnest, it is no laughing matter, they become sometimes at such Meetings, Fathers, by right and good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.)

            <p>Well, 'tis done, come give in your evidence; have you upon search found this same antipathy-teat about honest Gentleman? No, he's free and clear for that matter: But I find an ill habit of body and mind, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by humour of singularity, pride, envy and lean-chapt malice, which is the only cause of this dislike against this Church-cat of his own making; and only speaks this same Cat-hater to be <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>For (to keep to the Allegory) since Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies (which he calls the Ratcatcher) must needs be in the Church one way or other, in one form or other; whilst we have bodies, we must serve God either in the posture of kneeling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (which he calls the Ratcatcher Cat) or else in the posture of sitting, lolling, lying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (which I'l call Ratcatcher Owl) to which I and millions more of honest Christians in these days, and ever since our Saviours time have had an antipathy; to retort therefore upon this wise disputant, and beat the Cat about the Owls-head of the Bouby; judge you, Gentlemen, which is most civil, to keep the Owl in the Church, by the Ceremonies of sitting, and lolling with hat upon skull, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the like irreverent

            <p>We live in a Foppish Generation, <hi>Hugh Peters</hi> ghost yet walks; he us'd to tell a story of Pus-cat, and Puss in her Majesty: It took wonderfully, and this nonsensical story of the Cat, because she made a mouth and mew'd against Ceremonies, was as good (at first) to some, as are nuts to Mother-midnight.</p>
            <p>What wicked design men can have in blurring paper, and make it dear at this rate, I cannot tell; but sure I am the greatest purchase they get by it, is only infamy, amongst all wise men, by rendring themselves in print publick laughingstocks, a scorn and a proverb.</p>
            <p>The truth is, I find a great deal more difficulty in perswading my mind to stoop so low, as to take any notice of such despicable fellows, or what they print, than to consute them: Why? tell me seriously, was there ever any argument so vilely ridiculous, as this of the Cat?</p>

Orthodox man that can write like a man or, a Scholar? can they play the men only to the women? I'l assure you, now that I have here thrust out Sermons from Religious Worship, that used to thrust out all Religious Worship, and have introduc'd Ceremonies as a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary part of Divine and Holy Worship; they had need rally all their forces, or they, are routed for ever. And to encourage the best of them to the Ran-counter, I'l help them with a weapon, from <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 9. Let them manage it and flourish it as well as they can.</p>
            <p>But I would not have them, for their own credit, to tell the world, any more lyes in print; and say, I speak against Preaching and Faith, and Sermons the means of Faith; if they should, they tell a damn'd lye; I would not have Sermons (so they be plain, honest and seasonable) at all undervalued, or disused when occasion calls for it, and the peoples ignorance or negligence; But I will not yet let them take place in Gods Worship, Sermons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but man speaking to man, or at best, when Gods assistance concurrs, it is but heavenly influence upon man, which is another thing than Gods Holy Worship, which ought to be our daily sacrifice, in exercises of Faith, the Sacraments as occasion offers, constant Prayers, Praises, and Ceremonies, according
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:94128:160"/>
to our holy, heavenly and incomparable Common-prayer-Book.</p>
            <p>Ceremonies, will <hi>Greg.</hi> and the rest of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverian Orthodox say, Ceremonies, they are one ground of our quarrel with your way of worship, and the great ground, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing superstitious, and but bodily worship.</p>
            <p>But bodily worship? why? what would you have?

            <p>How does the Apostle beg of the <hi>Romans,</hi> with many imprecations, for the Ceremonies of bodily worship, in Gods holy Worship, as a most reasonable service to him, <hi>A holy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable and living sacrifice unto God,</hi> Rom. 12. 1. And bids them all to open their mouths together in Prayer, Praises, and Worship of God, as if they had but one mouth among them all, as well as <hi>one mind in glorifying God,</hi> Rom. 15. 6.</p>
            <p>And also calls upon the <hi>Corinthians</hi> not only to do the great duty, but the lesser duty; not only to glorifie God with their spirits, but <hi>with their bodies,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 20. And that for a very good reason, because the <hi>body</hi> is

Gods purchase, as well as the soul; Christ hath bought <hi>both,</hi> paid a price for <hi>both;</hi> both there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>body</hi> as well <hi>soul must glorifie God,</hi> by reverent postures and gestures, as <hi>kneelings, bowing,</hi> sometimes even <hi>to the very ground,</hi> after the Pattern and example of <hi>our Saviour, Mat.</hi> 26. 39.</p>

            <p>What can be said <hi>too smartly</hi> and home to such <hi>malignancies,</hi> as these Foppish stories, Lectures, whimsees, wrestings of sacred Scripture, by <hi>Hugh Peters</hi> and the rest of the Tribe, which has undone us <hi>once</hi> already; he that cheats <hi>once</hi> 'tis <hi>his</hi> fault, but if I am cheated <hi>twice</hi> with the <hi>same</hi> Juggle, Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation and Legerdemayn, though from <hi>another Hocus</hi> or pick-pocket, I may thank my self; no matter; Look better to the pocket another time.</p>
            <p>Aftertimes, (for envy, (like hollow friends) accompanies every man that is worth any thing, till he comes in his Grave, and then it leaves him) (when prejudice and passion does not bribe the judgment) will best de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, which of these three <hi>(Greg.

Indeed they all three face one way, go one way, and follow one and the same Modern Orthodoxy, but with a different style, and under a different name.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hugh Peters</hi> held forth &amp; manag'd Modern Orthodoxy under the name of <hi>the good Old Cause;</hi> but <hi>Father Gray beard</hi> follows it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of <hi>the Cause too good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hugh Peters</hi> rendred the good Old Cause good enough to be fought for; but <hi>Greg.</hi> has a higher value for it, at least seems to be so chary and tender over it, that he says, it <hi>is too good to be fought for.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But both of them agree in fundamentals, and with joynt forces inveigh against the King, our late Sovereign, and his whole Reign; rendring it and him despicable, and deform'd all over with <hi>Ceremonies, Arminia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism, and Manwaring.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Both of them agree against the Common Enemy, <hi>Bishops and Evil Councellors;</hi> both of them quarrel with the Cross after Baptism, and kneeling at the Sacrament.</p>
            <p>Only <hi>Hugh Peters</hi> does more tolerably pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to Controversies in Divinity, as not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the Road of his Profession: But, certainly this same <hi>Greg.</hi> whatever he be, is no Divine.</p>
            <p>It would almost tempt Charity to very hard thoughts of him, whilst he, like <hi>Julian</hi> the
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:94128:164"/>
Apostate, prosecutes so vehemently and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciously Religion and all religious men.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Plato</hi>'s transmigration of souls were true, I should conclude that <hi>Cham</hi> was again in him Metampsuchos'd, he does so turn up the Fathers of the Church, and exposing their nakedness to his Power, slashes them for their <hi>worthy Cares.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But his Rod does most wound his own face, and his own malice, and betraying its self, becomes his own Executioner.</p>
            <p>For certainly if his conscience were awake, it would fly in his face, and make him recant, (with St. <hi>Paul</hi> for a less defamation una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares) <hi>I wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>These soft and unmanly Rules of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Policy, may perhaps agree with your own effeminate temper; but they are not grounded upon Reason nor Religion.</p>
            <p>Indeed when the light of these are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scured and Hood-wink'd with fear and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardise, the man is no more a man, much less a Governour, nor with these circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances capable of direction; for fear frights' h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>But Almighty God does usually give large and noble souls to them that are design'd for Government, and not capable of such puny impressions of fear, that mollifie and unman vulgar and narrow spirits. The threatning <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>This noble spirit of Government is called in Holy writ, the spirit of God, which came upon <hi>Soul</hi> when anointed to be a King, and upon the <hi>seventy</hi> Elders, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. 17. when they were appointed to be Councellors of State.</p>
            <p>Indeed those <hi>Independents, Numb.</hi> 16. 3. <hi>Korah, Dathan, Abiram</hi> and their Crew thought themselves as good as the best, and as holy as the best, and as good as their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, but <hi>Moses</hi> presently shew'd them the difference on't.</p>
            <p>There are many incomparable instances in the Bible, which will teach Governours better policy, than puny and narrow hearted <hi>Greg.</hi> dares think on, for all the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations he gives the Bible, for the most ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute accomplishment of a Politician.

<pb n="320" facs="tcp:94128:166"/>
and not hazard himself among the Rebels and tumults? Hell was broke loose, the people swarming in uproars, and terrible in threatnings: or if he could not have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded <hi>Moses</hi> to run away, he would as he does to our Governours, insinuate the Wisdom and necessity of pleasing the people, coming with cap in hand, rather than sword in hand, and beg of them for Gods sake to be quiet and they should have any thing. But <hi>Moses</hi> Gods servant was not so, he was faithful to himself and the true measures of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and knew if he had rendred himself to their mercy, and yielded to their rage, it had been but offering his throat to be cut; a sad instance whereof I could give you in these late times; But what does <hi>Moses</hi> in this case? <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. 26, 27. <hi>who is on the Lords side?</hi> whose for me? let him come to me.

To manage the Reins of Government thus with a steddy hand, and to ride with a Hank, is the best of all both for King and people, as we have found: head-strong Jades would kill themselves, if you lay the Reins upon their necks, it is their happiness and ease to be rid with a Curb: a licentious Government is no Government, it is <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictio in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>But it is (in my Sphere) to instruct people what a blessing attends their Obedience to their Supreme Governours, if when they command some things in Religion, which in Circumstantials of Religion are poynt-blank
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:94128:167"/>
against God's own Law; and yet God likes it well, blesses the people for such obedience, though the Command of their Governours (perswaded thereunto out of good Reason, some great convenience or Necessity) was directly different from the Command of God.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>King and his Council</hi> made an Order to <hi>keep the Sacrament</hi> of the Passeover, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. 2. together with the advice and concurrence of the <hi>Parliament</hi> therein, called there, <hi>all the Congregation,</hi> it must be meant in their <hi>Representatives:</hi> for <hi>all</hi> the People, nor the thousandth part could not come to hear, or know what was done at the <hi>great Council,</hi> much less give their votes; I say, this King <hi>Hezekiah with his Council and great Council of the Congregation</hi> made a Decree to keep the Passover in the <hi>second Month.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is <hi>worse</hi> than the <hi>Cross after</hi> Baptism and <hi>Kneeling</hi> at the Sacrament; for we can find no beginning when <hi>they</hi> entred into the Church, and therefore have as much cause to think it was the <hi>posture</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles</hi> and their constant practice, if not <hi>more</hi> cause, than to think the contrary.</p>
            <p>But here in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. 2. is an <hi>Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> (I'll call it so, for the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of it in English phrase; for it is of the same nature) <hi>quite contrary</hi> to the Law

of God concerning the Sacrament, as to one Circumstantial of Time.</p>
            <p>God commands to keep it in the <hi>first</hi> Month, and positively reiterates the Command, and bids them keep it in that appointed season, <hi>Num.</hi> 9 2, 3, 5.</p>
            <p>The King and Parliament say to the People, we command you for certain good reasons and motives to observe the Sacrament in the second Month.</p>

            <p>And let them consider without prejudice, and in the fear of Almighty God, that when the Sons of <hi>Jonadab,</hi> the Sons of <hi>Rechab,</hi> in obedience to him their Superiour, submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his <hi>Humane-law</hi> in <hi>drinking no Wine, nor building Houses, nor planting Vineyards,</hi> (which certainly are all very good things, and God likewise tells man that all the good creatures he made on purpose for him and his use, <hi>every herb bearing seed, and every tree bearing fruit, commanding it should be to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind for meat,</hi> &amp;c.) yet in obedience to the first <hi>commandment with promise,</hi> they would not take the liberty and priviledge warranted to
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:94128:170"/>
them by God and his Word, but would <hi>obey the commandment of Jonadab their father, and keep all his precepts:</hi> And God did so love them for it, that he blesses them for it, saying, <hi>Jer.</hi> 35. 18, 19. <hi>Thus saith the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel; Because ye have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts, and done according to all that he hath commanded you: Therefore, thus saith saith the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dab the son of Rechab, shall not want a man to stand before me for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Happy would it be for the people of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in soul and body, and estate, here and hereafter, on earth and in heaven, if they would observe <hi>these</hi> thing, rather than the <hi>wily</hi> wrestings of Holy Writ by crafty Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers that have no way to cheat the people and be admired by them, but by such Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices as cheat them of their souls too, and make the Kingdom so disturbed, and their followers too; and the bottom of all these juglings is but to get a paltry sneaking lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and a little popular applause.</p>
            <p>And then must our Governours, and <hi>the King in especial</hi> be <hi>therein</hi> happy too, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie every way the Anagram of his name in Latine,</p>

            <p>When <hi>Nero</hi> set <hi>Rome</hi> on fire, he played up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Ho-boy</hi> all the time, and laid the <hi>blame</hi> on the Christians; and thus <hi>Greg.

            <p>Nor must his Majesty so much as think of their bloody and unparallel'd Cruelty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi>'s Father too was mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, and his Kinsman, <hi>Henry</hi> IV. of <hi>France</hi> likewise, and <hi>Henry</hi> III. and such <hi>Gentlemens Memories</hi> had their Successors and the Cabinet-Council, that they let the murderers escape <hi>scot-free;</hi> and if <hi>piety and good nature</hi> would move for a stricter vindication of his Fathers death, yet in <hi>Policy,</hi> have a care, displease not the Villains, as you love your Kingdoms, for a sturdy <hi>Swiss,</hi> and a <hi>malepert Fisher-boy</hi>

            <p>And if I have beat all these <hi>Butt-ends</hi> of his upon his <hi>own Pate,</hi> and vindicated King <hi>Charles</hi> I. his Reign from that <hi>deformity,</hi> wherewith both <hi>it,</hi> his <hi>Majesty</hi> and Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud</hi> are by this bold Author, as <hi>falsly</hi> and <hi>maliciously,</hi> as well as most <hi>unseasonably,</hi> in this Juncture maligned, I have my end.</p>

            </p>
            <p>I have dealt with him all along, as is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed in the method for cure of <hi>unruly and vain talkers and deceivers,</hi> Tit. 1. 13. namely, rebuk'd him as sharply, <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>And <hi>now I have done;</hi> and (to write after him, <hi>p.</hi> 325. but withall <hi>to set him</hi> a better <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py)</hi>

I shall think <hi>my self largely recompen sed for this trouble,</hi> if <hi>Greg.</hi> and others <hi>shall learn by this Example, that it is not impossible thus long to be merry and angry,</hi> as he was; but to be merry and angry, and <hi>yet not sin by, traducing</hi> the most innocent and honourable Persons, <hi>dead</hi> and <hi>alive,</hi> by such <hi>superfetation</hi> of Rayl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as <hi>he</hi> has done.</p>
