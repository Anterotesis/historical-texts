            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100812:3"/>
now depending in the Kingdom for payment of Moneys in Specie do far ſurmount all the Species of Money in the Kingdom; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Money is become more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable than Bills of Credit, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they that have the demands of it do and will demand it; and the more they demand it, the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the price riſes, ſo that the price multiplies the demands, and the demands advance the price, which renders the performance of theſe paſt Contracts to be impoſſible: And thus the Kingdom ſtands Stock-jobbed, by being obliged to deliver what they have not: And yet theſe Contracts (tho' they are impoſſible to be performed) are lawful, for by the Law where the Condition of a Bond is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, the Bond it ſelf is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, and the Obligee may ſue for the Penalty, and have Judgment;

               <p>And notwithſtanding that the whole Moneys of the Kingdom ſtand anticipated by the paſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, the preſent Exigencies and the growing Contracts call for as much more, and 'tis impoſſible to anſwer theſe Demands but by the Money due on the former Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, taking it from whence 'tis already due, and lending it to the preſent Wants; and thus the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick have had the greateſt part of their late Supplyes, (which I don't obſerve as a miſapplication of the Moneys, (under our Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) but as an Evidence of our Neceſſities) <hi>Therefore for preſerving the peace of the Kingdom, in relation

Food, Sickneſs our Phyſick, and Rapine our Laws; Laws neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated Trade, Trade neceſſitated Money, and the multiplyed occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions for Money doth now put us upon a neceſſity of inventing ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Species of it, and therefore we muſt find it out. What if the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Mines were exhauſted, or the Laws of their Countrey (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting the Exportation of them) obſerved, muſt the whole World ſtand ſtill? As Silver and Gold were invented for Money, when they were to be had, ſo when we cann't have that, we muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſomething elſe (which may be had) inſtead of it. The whole World once lay open for Man and Beaſts to be Tenants in common of it all, but while it lay ſo, it was incapable of improvement, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no Man could preſerve the benefit of his own Labour to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100812:5"/>
and this forced men upon Agreements to incloſe, and that every Man ſhould have a Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in his own Incloſure, which was the firſt initiating of Laws, and this Law forced Trade. For the Earth conſiſting of divers Veins, of different qualities, diſtant from one another, one man came to have occaſion of ſomething which lay in (<hi>alieno ſolo</hi>) another man's Incloſure, and ſo they exchanged with one another; but the things exchanged not being always equal in value, nor to be delivered at the ſame time and place, put men upon an Invention of Pledges, or ſecurity for the things delivered, until the value thereof ſhould be returned in another Commodity; and theſe at firſt were but parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Tokens between one man and another, 'till by degrees Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and Gold (having acquired a
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100812:5"/>
certain value from the uſes made of it for other things) became the common pledge of the World, and by further degrees the Values thereof came to be aſcertained by Laws, which hath advanced it to an extravagant price, contrary to the original intention of it. The ſole uſe of Money (as Money) is but to keep an Account of other things by; it is a Tool in Trade found out by the Policy of Man, and that it might not grow into any other uſe, the firſt Law of the World (foreſeeing the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief) forbid thoſe that had it, from taking Intereſt for the Loan of it, from any but thoſe whom they deſigned to impoveriſh by it: But ſince this prohibited uſe of it hath advanced it above its origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal inſtitution, we muſt invent ſomething elſe inſtead of it, as they who had the firſt Occaſions
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100812:6"/>
of Money did invent Gold and Silver: <hi>And therefore this Neceſſity is no Cauſe to diſcourage us from proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in publick or private Affairs, but rather to force us upon an Invention which otherwiſe we ſhould not find out.</hi>

               <head>Third Aſſertion.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>That all Propoſals for making Bills of Credit current Money directly, by Act of Parliament, can be of no uſe in this Invention.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Proved.</note>For, 1. <hi>Theſe Propoſals are Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt,</hi> being more than the Law doth in relation to the Coyns of the Kingdom. The Law never makes the Coyns of the Kingdom to be current in any Payments but where they are agreed to be paid, but theſe Propoſals would make theſe
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100812:6"/>
Bills current in Payments, in which they were never agreed for, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are unjuſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>They are Illegal</hi>: I mean, they are an Inverſion of Laws, which the Legiſlative Power have no power to do; their Name defines their power not to be abſolute, but only a power of making Laws; and the intent of all Laws being for the preſervation of Life and Property, whatever violates this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, is no Law. Should an Act paſs, that every Man in the Kingdom ſhould kill himſelf, or give his Eſtate to any one elſe that would do it for him, this would be no Law, nor any Man's Life or Eſtate bound by it. Now ſome Men have turned their Properties into Land, and ſome into Money, and all by Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with one another; and ſhould an Act paſs, that a Man who hath agreed for, and purchaſed 500 <hi>l.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100812:7"/>
per Annum</hi> in Land, ſhould convey that Eſtate to any Man who would pay him 10000 <hi>l.</hi> in Gold or Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, this would be no Law; then by the ſame parity of Reaſon, ſhould an Act paſs that any Man who hath contracted for 10000 <hi>l.</hi> to be paid him in Money, ſhould aſſign this Contract to any one, who would convey to him 500 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> in Land, this would be no Law; for if ſuch Acts ſhould be admitted as Laws, they put an end to all Laws. Men cann't deal but by Agreements with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and if the Law will invert thoſe Agreements, this puts an end to all dealing, <hi>and therefore theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals are Illegal,</hi> by which I hope I ſhall not be cenſured as irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of the Legiſlative Power, for I mention this in reverence to thoſe Laws of which they are the Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlators. I don't ſay, but one Man
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100812:7"/>
may by Conqueſt get an abſolute Power over another, but this is by Uſurpation and Wrong, and not by Law; for all Laws are the Agreements of Men, and no Man ever by his own Agreement deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered himſelf into the diſpoſal of an abſolute Power. God himſelf (tho' a ſupream Power, and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute over all) doth not demand Man to deliver himſelf up into his Power as abſolute, but treats with him by a Law of Juſtice, in which he makes himſelf a Party, and ſtands obliged to the performance of ſeveral things, as the Condition of Man's Obedience, and therefore for man to aſſume a right of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by an abſolute Power, is to ſet himſelf above God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Theſe Propoſals are impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> and (ſhould they be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) would be ineffectual. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe an Act ſhould paſs, that a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

of a Bill of 100 <hi>l.</hi> ſhould be a ſufficient tender of 100 <hi>l.</hi> contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for in lawful Money of <hi>England,</hi> and the People ſhould think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves bound by this as a Law, then their ſtudy would be to evade this Law, by changing their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts from lawful Money of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to ſome other Species, <hi>As ſo many Ounces of Gold and Silver,</hi> which would not be conſtrued to be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Money of <hi>England,</hi> and ſo then the Act would not reach it; and if the Act ſhould follow theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, and be changed as often as the Contracts, it muſt at laſt be ſo general, that a tender of a Bill for payment of 10 <hi>l.</hi> ſhould be a good tender for all Commodities agreed to be delivered of the value of 10 <hi>l.</hi> and ſo when a Man had contracted for a Horſe, he ſhould have a Bank Bill delivered him to ride on, <hi>and therefore the Propoſals

Money, <hi>That 'tis Money that buys Land,</hi> is comprehenſive of all the uſes of it; for whatever will buy Land will buy all Commodities.

Man deals in nothing but Earth; the Merchants are the Factors of the World, to exchange one part of the Earth for another: The King himſelf is fed by the labour of the Ox, and the cloathing of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and the victualing of the Navy, muſt all be paid for to the Owner of the Soil, as the ultimate Receiver, and whatever the ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate

               <p>Secondly, <hi>As they would thereby become effective Money,</hi> ſo they would become <hi>Lawful Money of England</hi>; becauſe the Law would compel the payment of them. The Law

Money and Bills never keep long at a par; if Bills are not better than Money, they'll ſoon be worſe: If Money gets the upper Hand of Credit, it puts an end to all Credit. There is at this day no Credit in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Credit is when Men chooſe Bills rather than Money, and not when they take them only becauſe they can't receive Money. The preſent Credit of the Kingdom is no more than the Credit of a man who can't pay his Debts, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore gives Bond, which his Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors are forced to accept for want of money. The <hi>Bank</hi> of <hi>England</hi> have iſſued out Bills which they

cannot pay, and ſo the People that have their Bills muſt keep them. But there is no freſh Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney brought into their Bank for their Bills, without which no Credit can be maintain'd: And they finding great Demands upon them, immediately raiſed the Intereſt upon their Bills, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping thereby to keep thoſe Bills which were out againſt them from being demanded of them, and to draw in freſh Monies into them: But this proved ſo ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, that their Bills at Intereſt are at no more value than their Bills without Intereſt, which ſhews plainly, that the giving Intereſt on Bills doth add no Credit to a Bank. For raiſing the intereſt on the Bills of the Bank, raiſes the Intereſt of Monies out of the Bank, and ſo keeps the Monies from them. The more a Bank raiſes their Intereſt

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100812:17"/>
down the Price of Money below their Bills, which is now got a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove them: For let Money be of what Weight it will, if thoſe who have the Receipt of it, will accept Bills at a higher rate, this doth depreciate the Money, and keeps the Bills above them: And therefore in caſe this Land-Bank be eſtabliſhed by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (as is propoſed) 'tis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that the Intereſt of 3 <hi>l.</hi> 10 <hi>s. per Cent.</hi> ſhall be reduced to 3 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> to all thoſe who will pay it in the Land-Bank Bills, which will advance the Credit of the Bank, and conſequently their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit; by enabling them to lend great quantities.

               <p>When we addreſs to our Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours,<note place="margin">Proved.</note> for any thing to be done by them, it is Duty and Good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to conſider, 1ſt. <hi>That the Notion and Intent of the thing we propoſe be uſeful and honeſt, in caſe it can be effected.</hi> 2dly. <hi>That the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of it be made viſible and plain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we offer it</hi>: 3dly. <hi>That we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100812:24"/>
every thing ready for their</hi> Fiat, <hi>which is to give the Sanction</hi>; that they may have nothing to do, but what can be done by none but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: Now that the <hi>Notion</hi> and Intent of forming theſe Securities of Lands into the Qualities of Money, and uſing them as Money, will be eſteemed by the Legiſlative Power to be uſeful and honeſt, in caſe it can be effected, cannot remain a Doubt. Then the next Query is, <hi>Whether the practice of this Notion can be made viſible and plain?</hi> The firſt part of the Notion is the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe Securities into the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of Money, and this belongs to him that offers the Invention, for 'tis not the Buſineſs of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative Power to draw Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Forms, thoſe muſt be done by ſome one of that Science to which theſe Forms and Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments relate. And that I may not
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:100812:24"/>
ſeem to amuſe with implicite terms, this Form is nothing but <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion</hi>: The forming the Securities of Lands into the Qualities of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, is no more than <hi>Dividing theſe Securities into ſmaller Summs.</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion is the firſt thing in Form. In the Deſcription of the Creation it's ſaid to be without Form, and void, 'till it was divided, <hi>The Light from the Darkneſs, and the Waters from the Dry Land</hi>; and by theſe Lights, Eternity was divided, and ſub-divided into Time, of <hi>Years, Days and Hours,</hi> for Man to keep his Accounts by; for Eternity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided is of no uſe to Man. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing is more or leſs valuable, as 'tis more or leſs capable of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion. Now 'till theſe Securities were made diviſible, all the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due of the Invention was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; for if the Securities them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are not capable of being
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:100812:25"/>
formed into the Qualities of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, it is not in the Power of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to make them ſo. But this firſt Part of the Invention is actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally done, and hath ſhewed it ſelf in all the parts of it. The 26<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> 1695. was the firſt day of iſſuing out Bills charged upon Lands, (which are the Securities thereof di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided) and theſe were the firſt Bills (we hear of) that have been charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon Lands, and iſſued out for Money: And to give plain Inſtances that theſe Securities, ſo divided into Bills, are Money, the Mortgagees who had theſe Securities before they were divided, and were to receive the Monies due upon them, brought their Securities to the Bank, to be formed into Bills, and received back thoſe Bills for their Money; <hi>They brought the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion into the Bank, and took it back in Coin</hi>; and for doing this
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:100812:25"/>
the Owners of the Lands are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to pay a ſmall Intereſt to the Bank, for keeping a Caſh of other Monies, to anſwer theſe Bills as they are demanded, (<hi>and this by the way may ſilence all Enquiries into the profit of the Bank</hi>): And in this manner there has been iſſued out forty five thouſand Pounds in Bills, all which have been paid and repaid as Money, and the Bank had valued Eſtates for iſſuing out One hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds more, but fore-ſeeing the impoſſibility of maintaining a Credit in their Infancy, during the Regulation of the Coin, they ſtopt their Hands, and content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at preſent in paying their Bills already iſſued, and giving an undeniable demonſtration of the firſt part of the Invention, by form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Securities of Lands into the Qualities of Money, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſtanding ready for the Sanction
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:100812:26"/>
and aſſiſtance of the Legiſlative Power towards the perfecting of this Invention.</p>
               <p>What was paſſed by the Act of laſt Seſſions, relating to Lands, and is now humbled repreſented to the Legiſlative Power, is,</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That the Subſcribers may be incorporated,</hi> in order to ſtand ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Lands to be conveyed to them, to prevent the charge or Fraud of Truſtees. In the dividing the Securities of Lands, the Legal Eſtates thereof muſt be conveyed to Truſtees, who are to ſtand ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the firſt place for the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who have the Bills charged on the Lands, and afterwards in truſt for the Owners of the Lands, who make the Conveyances; and to prevent the Legal Eſtates from going to Heirs or Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, there muſt be ſeveral Truſtees in every Conveyance, which may
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:100812:26"/>
occaſion great Charge and Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in transferring the Securities, eſpecially if the Truſtees prove corrupt, (which often happens in common Securities, amongſt pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Men): I have known a Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gager forced to pay twenty Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas to a parcel of Truſtees, for ſealing an Aſſignment of his Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage: Now this charge of Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring Securities entailed on Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Eſtates, is as real Incumbrance upon them as Fines upon alienations are upon Copy-holds: And if (as hath been obſerved) the transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Titles of Land to Money, and making the aſſignment of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry piece to be by Deed, would depreciate it, and incapacitate it from being Money, by the ſame reaſon the transferring the Titles of Money to Lands, and making the delivery only to be a Title, would (of it ſelf) render them much more
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:100812:27"/>
valuable; and tho' the equitable Intereſts only (which are the Bills) can be aſſigned by Delivery, yet the leſs Charge is incident to transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Legal Eſtates, the more valuable the Lands will be, <hi>And this is the Intent of being Incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.</hi> A great part of the Towns and Trades in <hi>England</hi> have been incorporated by Kings or Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for the conveniency of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own Buſineſs. The <hi>Worſted-Weavers</hi> in <hi>Yarmouth</hi> and <hi>Lynn</hi> were each of them incorporated by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, in 15<hi>th. Hen.</hi> 8. with a power to have a Seal for their own Cloths, for no other reaſon than that it was before painful and coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for them to carry their Cloths to be ſealed at <hi>Norwich,</hi> which they were obliged to by a former Act. And the <hi>School of Norleech in Glouceſter-ſhire</hi> was Incorporated by Parliament, in 4. <hi>Jac.</hi> 1. upon the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:100812:27"/>
Opinion of three Lord Keepers, and two Judges, that they ought to be Incorporated, in order to ſtand ſeized of their own Lands; for that the ſurviving Feoffee of the School-Lands went about to defraud the School, by making a long Leaſe to his own Son, under a ſmall Rent. If therefore the Kings and Parliaments of <hi>England</hi> have incorporated ſo many Towns and Trades, for the conveniency of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their buſineſs, and that the Parliament (in the firſt of theſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes) incorporated two Companies of <hi>Weavers,</hi> for preventing their trouble and charge in going to diſtant places; and (in the laſt Caſe) incorporated a Countrey-School, to prevent frauds in their Truſtees, can it be doubted that the preſent Legiſlative Power will deny the like conveniency for the better ſettling and improving all the Lands in the Kingdom? and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:100812:28"/>
in this they have ſignified their pleaſure already, by declaring (in the Act paſſed laſt Seſſions) that the intent of the Incorporation was in order to lending Monies on Lands.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Second</hi> Thing contained in the laſt Act, and now humbly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to the Parliament, is, <hi>The ſecuring the Titles of the Lands after they are ſo ſettled</hi>: And this is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the Settlement already executed and practiſed, whereby it is declared that the Lands con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed purſuant to that Settlement, (as long as they ſtand ſo convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) ſhall not be ſubject to any other Incumbrances than what ſhall be charged thereon by the Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers thereof, in the Regiſter-Books of the <hi>Bank</hi>; by which the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers are of Opinion, that the Lands will be protected againſt any other future Incumbrance. But to put
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:100812:28"/>
that out of all doubt, it was inſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Act, which can be no Unjuſtice to any, (as a Regiſter with a Retroſpect might be) being only the initiating of a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Regiſter, to be perfected by time.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Third</hi> Clauſe relating to Lands in the laſt Act, and now humbly repreſented, is, <hi>A power by publick ſale to ſell the Mortgaged Lands, in caſe the Money lent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the Bank be demanded, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid ſix years together</hi>; and with the Money ariſing by ſale to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the Mortgage-Monies, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning the Overplus to the Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Lands. And this will ſave Expences in Suits, which muſt otherwiſe be charged on the Lands.</p>
               <p>There are other Clauſes for Transferring the Bills, Searching of Judgments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the better
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:100812:29"/>
Security and Conveniency of the Bank.</p>
               <p>And that this Conſtitution may not be diverted from the end pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and intended, we ſhall think it no Penalty that the Bank may be reſtrained from iſſuing out any Bills, but what ſhall be charged upon Lands conveyed unto them, which is more reſtrictive than all the Clauſes drawn for that purpoſe by the late Oppoſers of the Act.</p>
               <p>Now all theſe being Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies only, grantable by the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative Power, without charging any Mans Property, and the uſe of them ſeeming ſo neceſſary and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious, <hi>It cannot be doubted but the Legiſlative Power will encourage this Invention, by reviving theſe Clauſes.</hi>

And as our own Security obliges us to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for future Defence, ſo Juſtice and Gratitude calls for the Arrears of the Army and Navy, who have fought upon the Honour of the Kingdom, to preſerve us at home in Peace; and therefore they who have enjoyed that repoſe, cannot tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call any thing their own, 'till they have made Proviſion to pay the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Farthing of ſo juſt a Debt.</p>
               <p>But the preſent Owners of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies depending that there will be a Neceſſity of raiſing the value of the Coin, (as the Term is) will not deliver it out of their Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to others, to receive the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage

               <p>The Drift of this Eſſay is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciate the Value of our Gold and Silver, as it now is, by making another Species more valuable than that, by the acceptance of it at a higher rate.

their Credit from Lands to what they apprehend more profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and of this we have had an Example in the Bank of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>: Whereas if a Bank for Lands be eſtabliſhed by it ſelf, their Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions for Money will ariſe by degrees, and may be raiſed by the Owners of the Land themſelves, either in Money, or in Securities on their Lands, which (by the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of this Invention) will be equally uſeful as Money of Gold or Silver: <hi>That therefore,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

the Invaſion of their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, begun upon them by him, who then had the poſſeſſion of the Crown, which being tranſlated to his preſent Majeſty, put him into the poſſeſſion of the Law, and thereby the Subjects into the uſe of their Liberties under him. But to maintain this Poſſeſſion, it was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary to begin the War againſt a Forreign Power, who had made themſelves formidable by unjuſt acquiſitions from their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; and this War hath and will coſt us forty Millions of Money, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly advanced to maintain it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Loſſes by Sea, and yet 'tis the beſt Money that ever the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ſpent; for by this they have preſerved the whole, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe had been loſt before now, and therefore according to that Saying, <hi>What is ſaved is got,</hi> the Expence and Loſs of the War hath purchaſed

upon them a ſufficient Encouragement to proceed in it, 'till they had made themſelves rich, and from their abundance the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of the Poor would be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed. I can ſay truly, that the Miſeries of the Poor do affect me, and yet I never had thoughts of Propoſing any thing directly for their Releif, apprehending their chiefeſt dependance to be upon the Superfluities of the rich; and this was the Proviſion made for them by the firſt Law of the World, which forbid the rakeing of the Corn, that the Poor might live upon the Gleanings, and the leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Poor is the Proviſion for the Fowls of the Air — Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as raiſing the Rates for the Poor, without adding ſomething to thoſe that are taxed, doth inſenſibly draw the Scot and Lot-men into the Poors-book, the Rates mulitiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the Poor as faſt as the Poor multiply the Rates — But let more be given to them who have the poſſeſſion of much already, and ſomewhat of it will naturally fall to them that have nothing.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>King</hi> himſelf, (whoſe Succeſs is our Safety) I can't con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him capable of any greater or leſs Enjoyment than his own Complacency in that Choice which hath deſcended upon him from Providence, to be the <hi>Deliverer</hi> of that People who have alſo cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen him for their <hi>Defender</hi>: And tho' his <hi>Allyance by Blood</hi> be the initiating of his Title to the Crown, yet his <hi>Election</hi> thereunto is his higheſt Perſonal Honour. <hi>To be a King</hi> is a mean thing in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of being <hi>made</hi> one. The <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer of the World</hi> was an Office of that ſtate and dignity, that his <hi>Harbinger</hi> is declared to be the

               <p>And I am glad to find my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments terminate here, for by this I know I have done, becauſe I have run it where I can go no further: Nor did I know what I was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to do, when I firſt put Pen to Paper, or where I ſhould begin or end, but having ſeen and (for ſome years) felt the extravagant rate of Money, I reſolved to ſearch the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digree of it, (as Men do of Upſtarts preferred above their Merit) and if I ſhould find it of an Honourable
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:100812:40"/>
Deſcent, and abſolutely neceſſary, I reſolved to conceal it, but if I could trace its Original to be mean and inconſiderable, I reſolved to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it, thereby to vilifye it in Mens Thoughts, as not ſo indiſpenſably neceſſary as 'tis generally appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended: Not but that Money is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary, but not the very Money of Gold and Silver. And in purſuit of this Enquiry, I found that tho' the common uſe of this (as of other things) be obvious unto all, yet when we would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſect them, to ſearch out the manner of their Subſiſtence and Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, we find them all faſtned down to the Root of Nature, by certain Fibers, which we muſt digg down to, and trace from thence into all the Labyrinths of Succeſſion, feeling all our way by that thread. There are no Fractions in Nature, nor any things independant, they are all
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:100812:41"/>
linked to one another in a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Chain, which reaches from the Creation to Eternity: And I have ſo far endeavoured to imitate Nature in what I have written, as to argue from a Chain of Poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſucceſſively depending upon one another, which is the moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous way of arguing, becauſe if one Poſition happens to be falſe, it vitiates all that follow: But there is no finding out the Truth any other way. 'Tis an eaſie matter to frame Sentences, and dance up and down with them and never be diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whether they are true or falſe, becauſe the Notions are not digeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into ſuch a Method, that either the Writer or Reader can judge of them: But when the Aſſertions are poſitive, and the Arguments to prove them follow immediately up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, the Writer and Reader can the better judge of them, as
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:100812:41"/>
they go along; and if every indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual be true by it ſelf, then the whole is true altogether, or elſe not. And upon review of what I have written, it all ſeems to me to be true, or elſe I would not pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh it; but yet my Arguments may be fantaſtical and fallacious, tho' I don't know it, therefore I offer them to be ſcanned by others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Truth made manifeſt</hi> is the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I have aimed at, and tho' my Aſſertions ſeem bold, I hope my Proofs do manifeſt them to be true; and if in finding out the Truth I have ſpoken more plainly and freely of ſome things that have fallen into my Arguments, than otherwiſe I ſhould do, I hope the Truth found out will excuſe my manner of Enquiry after it.</p>
               <p>And to clench the Nail, I'll ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to fling in a bolder Aſſertion than all the reſt, <hi>That there is no other
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:100812:42"/>
Foundation to build and ſupport the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of the Kingdom upon, than the very thing hereby propoſed</hi>: But this being a Negative; I'll let it ſtand to be falſifyed by thoſe who will prove the contrary, by doing it. Nor do I ſay that there is nothing elſe to be done, but that this ought not to be left undone, for tho' the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Supplies could be otherwiſe raiſed, the growing Intereſt of Money will eat out the Kingdom, unleſs ſomething be laid to the Root of it, to eat out that. The Intereſt of Money hath ſuch a <hi>Spell</hi> in it, that were the whole Coin of the Kingdom but ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pounds, the Rate of Intereſt for that Summ would ſet a price up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all the Lands in <hi>England,</hi> which are computed at 15 Millions <hi>per Annum</hi>; and the leſs principal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney there is, the higher the Intereſt riſes, therefore there is no way to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:100812:42"/>
fall the Intereſt but to multiply the Principal. <hi>In the time of the Late Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions,</hi> upon reading a Bill in the Houſe of <hi>Commons,</hi> Entituled, <hi>An Ordinance for ſuppreſſing the Horrible Sin of Adultery,</hi> a Member there moved that the Title might be, <hi>An Ordinance for the more ſecret com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the Horrible Sin of Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>: And conſidering how Uſury and Extortion have thriven under all the Laws made againſt them, the Titles of the Acts for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe might have been, <hi>For the more Artificial taking Extortion and Uſury.</hi> Now in multiplying the Principal of Money, perhaps other Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties may be ſo formed, as to ſupply the uſe of Monies as well as the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curities on Lands. But the Credit of them muſt depend upon their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance with Lands, eſpecially ſince the Owners of the Lands (having Intimation of their Strength) will
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:100812:43"/>
be able to ſuppreſs any Credit that ſhall be ſet up in Prejudice to their Eſtates.</p>
               <p>And after all this, had I not a greater Authority to juſtifie my Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions than all the Arguments I have uſed to prove them, I durſt not be ſo bold; but that I may not ſeem immodeſt by taking ſo much upon me, I own my ſelf ignorant of many other Accompliſhments, that I might attain to this, I have waved all Advantages in my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, to ſtudy <hi>A more convenient Settlement for Lands</hi>; and therefore I hope the more Learned and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful in that Science will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy me, if I ſhould be the Author of an Improvement in that point, and thereby entail upon my ſelf the Deſpicable Name of a Projector for doing it: However <hi>as to that,</hi> every Man is either a <hi>Projector,</hi> by finding out New Forms, or a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanick</hi>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:100812:43"/>
by copying after them: And if they who give me the Character of the former, will pleaſe to accept the Title of the latter, I ſhall not think my ſelf affronted: Eſpecially ſince the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Law</hi> themſelves, who have choſen that grave Sentence for their Motto, <hi>Nolumus Leges An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliae mutare,</hi> have been the Project<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors of New Inventions in the Law, which by time have grown into Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms. The Titles of the greateſt part of the Lands in <hi>England</hi> do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon an Invention of the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, in the manner of paſſing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries to bar Eſtates Tail, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Statute of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> 2<hi>
                     <hi rend="sup">nd.</hi>
                  </hi> For tho' the Writs on which theſe Recoveries are grounded, were ancient, yet the ſetting up a <hi>Common Vouchee,</hi> the Appearance of all Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties <hi>without Proces,</hi> Execution and Seiſin and Returns of the Writs <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:100812:44"/>
all done together in an inſtant,</hi> is a Project in the Law which by Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom hath gained the Name of <hi>A Common Recovery,</hi> and is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Common Aſſurance of Lands. And as the Titles of Lands do thus depend upon an Invention in the Law, ſo the manner now uſed for trying theſe Titles by Poſſeſſory Actions, (<hi>termed Eject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>) is an Invention in the Law, by the introducing of which the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient way of Tryals by <hi>real Actions</hi> is become ſo obſolete, That <hi>at a Call of Serjeants</hi> the Counts and Plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in <hi>Formedons</hi> being tranſcribed from Precedents, are delivered to theſe Graduates, only to be read over by them, <hi>as Reliques of the Law,</hi> amongſt other <hi>Antiquated Ceremonies</hi> uſed at that Solemnity.</p>
