            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

AFFLICTED MAN's
TESTIMONY
CONCERNING
His Troubles.</head>
            <p>LOng Afflictions expoſing me to many Oblo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies
and Dangers, I think meet for the
Goſpel's ſake to leave ſome Account of
my Ways by this preſent Writing, that
Truth may appear whatever become of me.</p>
            <p>In my Youth while I ſtudied at <hi>Oxford,</hi> very
piercing inward Troubles preſſed my Mind for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Months together; which made me ſpend
many an hour in ſecret penſiveneſs, and by ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
to importune the Lord for his Mercy
and favour through Chriſt, in a more earneſt
manner than I had been acquainted with before.
And being heartily convinced of the goodneſs of
God, I took a Reſolution to ſerve him more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
than I had done, and ſoon found much ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in Duties both publick and private. About
that time I was viſited with a violent Feaver, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:31756:2"/>
that danger being paſt, another ſurprized me up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Occaſion following: One that ſeemed a
Genteel perſon took acquaintance with me, who
ſelling a Horſe in the Town, entred my Name
in the Toll-book as a Voucher for him. The
Buyer informing me that he was gone, and that
my Name was in the Book in his behalf, I was
much vexed at it, becauſe I ſuſpected him to be
extravagant. And when he came to <hi>Oxford</hi> again
I urged him to find another Voucher, and to take
out my Name, which with much indignation he
did, and then ſwore he would kill me; and I
think he came to my Chamber-door for that pu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Some time after he was taken in a Ro<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

and put to death, ſo God delivered me from
his hands. About the end of the Civil Wars,
Viſitors being ſent into the Univerſity, I was
among others queſtioned to be removed from a
Place I had in a Colledge, and another voted in:
My Crime was an Anſwer I had given to the ſaid
Viſitors, to ſubmit to them as far as lawfully I
might; and that was conſtrued to be a Contempt,
though I intended Modeſty and Warineſs by it.
Upon the ſolicitation of ſome Friends, the matter
was deferred, and a Fellowſhip in another Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
promiſed me. In <hi>June,</hi> 1649 I was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to make a Latin Declamation in Praiſe
of Clemency. The Theme being mitigating, and
gratefull to my Diſpoſition, and ſeveral conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
perſons being to hear the managing of it, I
did it as effectually as I could: And the Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof being always ſeaſonable, take a true
Copy of it as followeth.</p>

Whether my diſcourſe of <hi>Clemency</hi> procured me
ſeverity, I cannot tell, but ſure I am that ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it was uſed towards me; for I was accuſed as
diſaffected to the things then in being, and denyed
the Profits of the Fellowſhip promiſed me: the
Head of the Houſe, and the new Fellows there,
with the Viſitors connivance, combining to make
me <hi>Socius Honorarius</hi> only, though I was Senior to
them all but the Head. Being thus left deſtitute of
any encouragement in the Univerſity, after a while
I went into the Countrey to ſee my Friends, who
perſwaded me to be there employed, and the <hi>Sine
Curâ</hi> of <hi>Llanrhaiad</hi> in the Counties of <hi>Denbigh</hi> and
<hi>Montgomery</hi> being vacant by death, was conferred
on me; where being freed from the Pariſh charge,
I exerciſed my Talent in Preaching there, and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
and ſometimes Catechizing, and with ſuch
as were willing I monthly faſted and prayed on a
Week-day, either in private or in publick, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
others to aſſiſt me therein alſo. And com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
when I ſpent time in ſuch Exerciſes, I
ſhould have abundant Conſolations in my ſpirit.
But ſome of the richer ſort and others in that
Countrey, that did not reliſh ſuch things, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
more in natural Recreations, Company,
Complements, and other Buſineſſes, and were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
to be litigious, wrought me many troubles:
who hearing that the <hi>Regius</hi> Profeſſor in <hi>Cambridge</hi>
had a Promiſe of ſome <hi>Sine Cure,</hi> invited him to
make for mine, and to exhibit Articles againſt me
into the Protector's hand, alledging me to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected
to his Government, and inſufficient for the
Living I held. Thereupon an Order was made, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
me to appear before the Council, and it
was ſent down unto my Accuſers, who endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:31756:4"/>
to conceal it from me, that I might be outed
upon Contempt. They ſent a Fellow to my Houſe,
that left word with my Servant, that I ſhould be
at <hi>London</hi> within three days, and ſayd no more,
neither left any order. Yet they drew an <hi>Affida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit,</hi>
and got him to ſwear before a Maſter of
<hi>Chancery,</hi> that he left the Order at my Houſe.
Suſpecting the matter, I ſent up with ſpeed, and
had a Copy of my Accuſation, and time to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
it: And when it came to a hearing, their
Allegation of the firſt branch of the Accuſation
was diſcredited by their colluſion in the matter
of my Summons to appear, and the other was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed
by the Approvers of publick Preachers and
others; thereupon I was diſcharged, as being
wrongfully moleſted. Three Years after as I was
riding homewards from preaching in a Winter
Night, I obſerved a Man ſit on Horſeback at the
end of a dark Woody lane, who affronted me as I
rid by him, and attempted to aſſault me, but my
Horſe outwent him. Soon after one came down
with the great Seal to claim my Benefice, and by
the Date of his Pattent it appeared that it was
had out about the time that Lurcher ſet upon me;
but Times then altering, that pretence alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
ineffectual. In the Year 1660 about the
end of Winter, the Biſhop of the Dioceſs newly
enſtalled, ſends word that he had my Benefice
granted him in <hi>Comendam</hi> by the King, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
of my Farmers the Rents due for the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
foregoing, while I took pains there and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about.
For a while it ſeemed very harſh to me
to be deprived of my Livelihood and Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the more, in regard I had obtained it
fairly without miſplacing any Man, and paid
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:31756:5"/>
yearly about forty pounds out of it to Widows
and Fatherleſs, and had ſeven Years poſſeſſion of it,
and his Majeſty's Proclamation to continue all in
their poſſeſſions, unleſs ejected by due courſe of
Law; neither was any thing demanded of me by
Authority, that I refuſed to do: For nothing was
then requiſite to be tendred to Incumbents that I
heard of, but the Oath of Allegiance, which I took:
alſo for the <hi>rich man that had many Flocks, to take
away an only Lamb,</hi> might grieve a Prophet: Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
deeming a ſuit at Law would be as
bootleſs as vexatious, I did quietly ſit down by
the loſs.</p>
            <p>Afterwards I lived very <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rivately, and as inof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſively
as I could. For pe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ny greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
than the Law allows of, and never medled
with any deſigns to diſturb the Government; yet
I could not avoid the frequent moleſtations of
evil Men. In the Year 1666 ſeveral armed men,
and one of them with his Sword drawn, uttering
terrible words, ruſhed into my Houſe in the Night,
and abuſed my Family, c<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lled me a Traytor,
thruſt into my Cellar, and made themſelves drunk
with my Beer, and taking me Priſoner, barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
guarded me to the County Gaol, in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Paſſions drawing upon me by the way, tho'
I was conſcious to my ſelf of no Crime, neither
did they prove any againſt me that I heard of. It
coſt me Time and Money to be releaſed, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
my return home one of my Children dyed,
that took a Fright by that Riot, and a fret in my
abſence. Within few Months after my Wife and
ſome of the ſurviving Children being diſcouraged
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:31756:5"/>
in their Obedience to me, by the many Injuries
they ſaw inflicted upon me, became undutiful by
the Colluſiou of my Perſecutors, which did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitter
my Afflictions far more than any Priſon or
Danger I had been in, or feared to come into:
For ſeveral Years I had Comfort in them, while
I had ſorrow from others: when it was tempeſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
without doors, I had a calm within; before
the blows lighted on my Cloaths, but ſince on my
Bowels. But the worſe my Domeſt<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>k Troubles
were for me, the more vigorouſly they were <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
and encreaſed by thoſe that hated me Some
were employed to perſwade my Children that it
was better for them to be without me; and my
Wife was ſo far alienated from me, that ſhe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pourtuned
me to part with her and live aſunder,
though for ſixteen Years before we had lived toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as lovingly as any couple in that Countrey.
Then by mutual Conſent I was induced to go to
<hi>Oxford,</hi> and afterwards to <hi>London,</hi> where in the
Year 1675 as I was buſie about the Printing of
<hi>Welch</hi> Books, my Life was endangered by moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Poyſon, cauſing vehement burning and tearing
pains in my Body, and a ſenſible conflict in my
Cheſt and Bowels, like the beating of Pulſes. The
fourth Night I lay ſo, being brought to the ſoreſt
plight, upon a ſudden the pores of my Body
opened, and poured out ſuch abundance of ſweat
as wet my Shirt in few Minutes, bliſters brake out
upon my Lips, and I purged ſomewhat like blood.
And a few years after, as I was laboriouſly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
about correcting an Impreſſion of the <hi>Welch</hi>
Bible, I was again brought to Death's Door by
deadly poyſon, and while I lay ill, had a great
loſs by being robbed. And many times before
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:31756:6"/>
and ſince have found dangerous baits in my Food,
and perilous traps and ſnares laid for me in my
way.</p>
            <p>Having been in <hi>London</hi> a long while, I had a
deſire to ſee my Countrey, and therefore took a
Farm there, intending thereby to be helpful to
the remainder of my Children theſe laſt Years:
and though I thought to live below the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
yet Malice wrought againſt me ſtrangely
there, by killing or ſtealing my Cattel in the
Night, and throwing open my Corn and Graſs
to be eaten up, and ſometimes turning my Cattel
to other grounds, that they might be killed or
pounded; yea ſtigmatized Felons were brought to
a Court, there to ſwear falſly againſt me, and
the beſt of my Beaſts were preſently driven away
by a <hi>Levari,</hi> though I owed nothing to the Party
that procured it, neither ſhould I be permitted to
make my defence to evidence the Truth; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo many ways, and ſo greatly damnified, I
was forced to remove thence.</p>
            <p>In ſearching Old Authors for Advice in my
Straits, and finding good ſatisfaction therein, I
was induced to tranſlate and print ſome of their
Writings, calling them <hi>Fatherly Inſtructions:</hi> And
being extreamly aggrieved with the wrongs done
me and others, ſome openly, but the moſt ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>Iniquity working in a Myſtery,</hi> and that like it's
Author inviſibly; ſo that when I felt the ſmart, I
muſt <hi>propheſie who ſmote me,</hi> as the Crucifiers of
our Saviour bid him do: I added to it that Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix,
called <hi>Gildas Minimus,</hi> which I wrote to
diſſwade from Apoſtacy, and thoſe other Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
that are like to be very pernicious to
theſe Nations, if not timely repented of. And
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:31756:6"/>
expecting Calamity to come on the Land, I wrote
in it theſe few Verſes, which then I was loath
to print:
<q>
                  <l>Ah Nations proud, he that with many tears</l>
                  <l>Bewail'd your Sins, ſome cauſes of his fears</l>
                  <l>Hath written here, amend e're with great ſmart</l>
                  <l>A Penſil keen engrave them in your Heart.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Poyſons and ſecret Murders ſeemed moſt horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to me, and the Curſes pronounced againſt them
very formidable, as appears in the caſe of the
Men of <hi>Anathoth,</hi> for ſeeking to deſtroy the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Jeremy</hi> thereby. What we read in Chapter
11. <hi>v.</hi> 19. of his Propheſie, <hi>Let us deſtroy the Tree
with the Fruit,</hi> the <hi>Septuagint</hi> render, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
the vulgar Latin, <hi>Mittamus
lignum in panem ejus,</hi> another, <hi>Corrumpamus lignum in
pane ejus,</hi> the Chald. Paraphr. <hi>Mittamus venenum
mortiferum in cibo ejus ut diſperdamus eum,</hi> which is
in <hi>Engliſh, Let's put deadly poyſon in his meat, that
we may deſtroy him.</hi> In 22, 23 Verſes, the Lord
ſhews how he would recompenſe them for it;
<hi>Their young men ſhould die by the Sword, their Sons
and Daughters by Famine, and there ſhould be no rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having diligently ſought Direction of God by
Study and Prayer, I got my Mind fully ſatisfied,
that to follow the Precepts and Examples of
Chriſt, and his inſpired Servants, Prophets, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
and the Primitive Chriſtians, is the only
ſafe way for living and dying, for doing and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering,
which is the cauſe I do not run with the
ſtream of the World, nor take the ſame courſe as
moſt do, becauſe it's ſo much differing from that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:31756:7"/>
pattern; which inſtructed me what to do in my
caſe in reference to God and Man. My Soul
was earneſtly ſtirred up to examine the Evidence
of my Intereſt in God, and to look to my ſelf,
that I live in Obedience to his Goſpel, and by
ſeeking of him with a contrite Heart, he enabled
me to fear him more than thoſe that can kill my
Body, and to be willing to ſuffer rather than wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to ſin againſt him, and to <hi>partake of the Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of the Goſpel, rather than of the pleaſures of
Sin.</hi> I carefully looked to my deporument to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Men both high and low, yielding Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
tribute and tax to whom they were due,
praying for Superiours as earneſtly as for my ſelf;
and when I had opportunity to be ſerviceable to
the publick, in correcting <hi>Welch</hi> Books, or any
thing elſe, I diſcharged my Duty with diligence and
Faithfulneſs. And though I have been deprived of
my Preferment, which might have raiſed me a little
out of harms reach, that I ſhould not be troden
under all vulgar feet, yet I can be content, when
I conſider how ſtormy, toſſing and ſinful the
World hath been, ever ſince I was concerned to
manage any thing in it, making it difficult or
impoſſible for Scholars to obtain preferment, and
keep it during Life, without doing and ſaying,
if not ſwearing contradictories, uſing of Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and many queſtionable practices. Sometimes
in my Dangers and Loſſes I made lawful applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to Magiſtrates for protection, where I had
any hopes to be heard, and never medled with
any Plots to moleſt them, being obſervant of the
Oath of Allegiance; and in caſe I had not ſworn,
I thought it inconſiſtent with my Chriſtianity to
live in Fraud or Treachery, and ſpeaking peace
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:31756:7"/>
to lye in wait for Blood or Spoil. And ſhould I
by the wrongfulneſs of my Sufferings by perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of the lawfulneſs of my defence by reſiſting
any of my Oppreſſors, my deſtitute Condition for
many Years warns me ſufficiently not to expect
any to aſſiſt me therein: And if it would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence
in a <hi>Hercules</hi> to engage againſt two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
ſurely it would be ſo for me alone to aſſault
Legions. Since my Troubles grew extream, I
could have but few to joyn with me in Prayer,
and other Goſpel Duties; and if they would not
ſhed tears with me, it is not likely they would
ſhed Blood for me; <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>anae ſine viribus irae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As I am not Conſcious to my ſelf of any Crime
againſt Superiours, I am ignorant alſo what others
think of me in that reſpect, for no Body tells me
what my Affliction is for. When <hi>Joab</hi>'s Corn was
conſumed, he knew of whom to enquire the cauſe
of it, and how to prevent ſuch another loſs. But
no body is found to deal ſo well with me, as an
ill Man did with him. So that I muſt ſay to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Inſtrument of my Affliction, as our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
to him that buffeted him moſt wrongfully:
<hi>If I have ſpoken or done evil, bear witneſs of the evil,
but if well, why ſmiteſt thou me?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as I kept innocence towards thoſe above me,
I did ſo alſo towards thoſe about me, not ſeeking to
wrong, hurt, or defile any in Soul or Body, Name, or
Goods, either ſecretly or openly, traudulently or
violently; yea, ſometimes I had opportunity, and
took it to ſhew benevolence not only to my Friends,
but to my Foes alſo, by praying, admoniſhing,
and helping them in outward needs, and if I can
I will do ſo again. I acknowledge that under great
preſſures I have complained of my wrongs, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:31756:8"/>
the doers thereof, to ſuch as might diſſwade them
from their evil; but that I did any thing publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
or privately, with intention to bring any of
them to puniſhment, I utterly deny; and if any
miſchief befell any of them, it hath been without
my Deſign, Contrivance, or Conſent. Yea, I am
not without fears, leſt ſome of my dear Relations,
and loving Acquaintance, have been prejudiced by
my Perſecutors, upon occaſion of my Friendly
Converſe with them, or Communication of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And if it be ſo, I hope God will not impute to
me what was done againſt my Will, any more
than the Death of thoſe innocent Children to the
Wiſe Men that came to worſhip Chriſt at his Birth,
who though wiſe, yet contrary to their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
by their devout Enquiry ſtirred up <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi>'s
Cruelty, tydings of a meek Saviour making
him a Bloody Deſtroyer beyond all ſuſpicion.
My Diſpoſition was Moderate alſo towards the
eſtabliſhed Eccleſiaſtical Government, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
it's uſefulneſs in exhibiting the Scriptures
and Prayers to theſe Nations in their vulgar
Tongues, upholding Learning, and a deal of ſmooth
and grave Praying and Preaching, and melodious
Singing, which I hope by ſome are devoutly impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
And the generality it keeps in a Cuſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Profeſſion of the Chriſtian Religion, hitherto
keeping out Popery, Mahometaniſm, and Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm,
which are embraced by other Nations.</p>
            <p>Yet foraſmuch as the greateſt part of our
Countreys are void of true Grace, and Chriſtian
Godlineſs, or the likeneſs of it, as we may well
conclude by Scripture and Experience, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
unfit to communicate at Chriſts Table, and
to do many other Duties demanded in the Goſpel,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:31756:8"/>
I think it dangerous that Chriſt ſhould be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of a Spiritual, Zealous, Holy Worſhip, and
Church-Government, according to the pattern
given us in the New Teſtament. And therfore
am glad for the liberty given to ſuch as God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightens
and ſanctifies with his good Spirit, and
makes able to live according to the Goſpel, to
meet together in Chriſts Name, to worſhip him
with their Spirits, and to participate of his Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
being the ſeeketh ſuch to worſhip him, <hi>Joh.</hi>
4. and to exerciſe Spiritual Inſtruction and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
as he hath ordained, and which the carnal
multitudes in all Nations are unqualified for. As
praying in the Spirit, pouring out their Souls
with groans and tears, and elevated affections in
thankſgivings, without external Monitors, as Chriſt
and his Servants did in Primitive times, <hi>John</hi> 17.
<hi>Acts</hi> 4. 24. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26, 27. preaching with warmth
and earneſtneſs, <hi>Comforting others with the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
that themſelves are comforted of God,</hi> 2 Cor.
1. 4. Spiritually admoniſhing and reſtoring a lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Brother, and caſting out the impenitent, that
God may have a clean though little Temple to
dwell in, and not a Den of Thieves. And though
of a long time my Afflictions have bereaved me of
the help of ſuch Goſpel Society, and forcibly
hindered me to exerciſe my Talent, as I would,
for the promoting thereof, yet I congratulate that
others may have it.</p>
            <p>Envy need not counterwork this matter, the
ſucceſs thereof in this ſinful Age not being like
to be exceeding great. Providence in Judgment
for our Provocations, threatning to remove our
Candleſticks, rather than promiſing to encreaſe
our Lights. And the way that leadeth to Heaven
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:31756:9"/>
being narrow, and not paved with Pearls, nor
ſtrewed with Temporal alluring Flowers, but
Thorns rather, will be frequented but by few.
If there be no pieces of Silver given to the <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dases,</hi>
but that they be left as deſtitute as the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaniels,</hi>
if the ſetting Dogs and <hi>Wolves in Sheeps<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clothing</hi>
fare no better than the innocent Lambs,
'twill be apparent that Chriſts true Diſciples be
but a little Flo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>k; Vertue being poor, ſeldom
hath many Suitors. Though the Apoſtles and
their immediate Succeſſors in outward poverty
drew many followers after them by the ſweet Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
poured forth upon them, and the power of
miraculous Healing; yet now the Caſe is altered
in the following circumſtances. Then the Gentile
Churches were in their fruitful Youth and teem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Seaſon, and brought forth many Sons and
Daughters by the Goſpel ſeed; but now they are
grown old, withered and barren; both the Eaſtern
and Weſtern Nations having neglected to walk ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Goſpel for many Generations, the
Lord in anger permits them to <hi>obey unrighteouſneſs;</hi>
and becauſe <hi>they received not the love of the Truth
that they might be ſaved,</hi> they are left to continue
<hi>in ſtrong deluſion.</hi> In the laſt days times are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
to be very <hi>perilous,</hi> and little Gracious,
2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1, 2. The Spirit of God alſo being ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
mocked, becomes more reſerved; Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing
to work <hi>becauſe of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief,</hi> and other hainous
ſins, which makes religious Duties in moſt places leſs
vigorous than they have been formerly.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, The World needs not fear hurt
by godly Ones, whether they be many or few, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
or aſunder; Hypocrites I do not plead for.
As our Saviours Kingdom is not of this World,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:31756:9"/>
ſo his Childrens main part of it is not here, but
elſewhere laid up with him, and therefore have
the leſs need to fight in its defence with carnal
Weapons. Their Armour is ſpiritual, Faith their
Breaſt-plate, Zeal their Fire, Tears their Bullets,
and theſe are uſed for their Enemies protection
and ſalvation. So that the World may expect
benefit by having good men in it: I mean not
that benefit which ſome Politicks write of, That
the Prince is ſafer by having Subjects at Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
as <hi>Cato</hi> would keep Servants that were
at odds with one another, that if one imbezled
any thing, the other might betray him. If diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
among men be of uſe to their Governour,
there are enough about worldly matters. But
I mean ſuch a benefit as <hi>Joſeph</hi> brought upon the
Houſe of <hi>Potiphar.</hi> All Mankind at preſent is
more beholding to eight ſuch Perſons in <hi>Noah</hi>'s
Family, than to all the multitudes in that Age,
though <hi>mighty</hi> and <hi>of Renown,</hi> Gen. 6. and well it
had been for <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> if ten righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ones had been tolerated among them.</p>
            <p>And though the World need not fear hurt by
the preſervation of Gods Servants, yet it ſhould
greatly fear it for their deſtruction. <hi>Saul</hi> and
all <hi>Iſrael</hi> with him payd dear for ſlaying the
Prieſts of the Lord, and ſo did <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for
ſlaying his Son, and ſtoning his Prophets: And
probably wrath for Perſecuting is one deadly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient
in the Cup of Trembling now put into
the hands of moſt Nations, to cauſe in them
ſuch a Bloody-flux. It were well for theſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in the preſent dangers, if all Parties ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from Spite, and calling one another to their
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:31756:10"/>
ſeveral Devotions, as the Mariners did in <hi>Jonah</hi>'s
Tempeſt, could with their joynt endeavour pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie
God. It's to be much doubted whether the
Melody of our Organs and Temples can drown
the Cries of our Sins, and the wailings of the
Fatherleſs and Widows; or that the Halls of
our Corporations be ſo well furniſhed with Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
or Spiritual Righteouſneſs, or our Countrey
Barns with ſuch good Wheat, as will keep off

It would prove a beneficial Indulgence,
if the languid ſpirits of the ſeveral Forms of
our Religion ſhould be ſo well revived, as to
be able to divert, or overcome thoſe ſtrong
Judgments, that our Irreligion is like to bring
upon us.</p>
            <p>In my Caſe I have had many Experiences of
Gods goodneſs; I have ſeen much of his Power
and Faithfulneſs in all my Troubles: I put my
truſt in him, though I ſaw for certain that moſt
of the World about me was againſt me: Great
and Small, Friends and Foes, Profeſſors and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane,
Relations and Strangers, ſome reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me to the World, and accuſing me to men
in Power, ſome robbing and defrauding me of
my Eſtate, ſome tempting me to Uncleanneſs,
others poyſoning my Body; ſome writing, others
Preaching againſt me, and ſuch Ordinances were
mounted in many Pulpits as were levelled at me,
not to edifie, but to batter down my ſpiritual
Comforts, and I ſhould hear terrifying Voices
not from black Clouds only, but from bright
ones alſo; inſomuch that ſuch as knew my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:31756:10"/>
durſt not own me, but were afraid to
conſort with me; and ſeeing me ſet up as a
Mark for all to ſhoot at which venom'd Arrows,
they were cautious of coming near me, leſt they
ſhould be hit alſo; yet when <hi>all forſook me, the
Lord ſtood with me,</hi> and hath hitherto delivered
my Life from the innumerable Dangers aſſaulting
it. And though he permitted moſt of my Eſtate
to be gone from me, yet he giveth me content
and neceſſary Supplyes to this day, and good
Hopes of <hi>having in Heaven a better and an endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Subſtance,</hi> and more comfortable Manſions,
and Relations, than thoſe I am deprived of. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Providence in my behalf giveth evidence,
that the Fooliſhneſs of God is wiſer than ſubtle
Devils, and his Weakneſs ſtronger than mighty
malicious men; and that ſuch as put their truſt
in him ſhall not be confounded, whatever they
ſuffer for his ſake; and when this frail Life is
offered up, he'll give me that of whoſe Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Felicity I ſhall never be deprived.</p>
            <p>The Lord has been often pleaſed to let me have
Experiment alſo of his readineſs to hear my Cries
in all my ſtraits: When in ſorrows for Loſſes,
or apprehenſions of Dangers, <hi>my Soul is caſt down
or diſquieted within me,</hi> by making my Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to God in earneſt Prayer, I uſually obtain
Comfort, and ſhall be as ſecure and peaceable in
my Mind, as if nothing ailed me. In my Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes
I have had my Heart enlarged to pour
out ſupplications to the Author of Life, and
found them ſure Antidotes againſt the Infection
of Temptations that ſeek the deſtruction of my
Soul, and againſt the painful Operations of poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:31756:11"/>
in my Body, and have ſometimes obtained
eaſe before I aroſe from off my Knees. When
I had a ſwelling on the ſide of my Neck, which
could not be abated by taking Phyſick, ſolicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God for help, I had notice by Dream to cut
an Iſſue, which diſperſed the Humour in few
weeks. Once a Carpenter working at my Houſe
ſlit his Finger with his Hatchet, and though the
Blood at that time was ſoon ſtanched, yet the
man being gone to his Lodging, and opening the
wound to one that was skilful in Cures, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
it fell a Bleeding again ſo violently, that no
means could ſtop the Blood till ſeveral quarts
of it were loſt, and the man brought to the
point of Death. Being called out of my Bed,
I went to him, and being grieved to ſee him in
that Condition, and the more, becauſe he was
hurt at my Houſe, I called upon God in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half,
and immediately after it came into my Mind
that putting his Arm in cold Water might be a
means to help him: And thereupon I held his
Arm from his Elbow to his Wriſt in Water,
and plied it with a wet Cloth, and preſently
the Blood recoyled and ſtopt; and though the
wounded Man fell into a Swoon that Morning,
yet in due time he recovered his perfect Health.
It pleaſed God in that great need to put me up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that Remedy, which before I had never
thought of. Long ago I had a ſenſible attack
by ſome Spirit, and deliverance from him while
I called on God. Having ſate up late at my
Study, and none being with me in the room,
I thought I heard the ruſling of one behind me,
when I turned I could ſee no body. As ſoon as
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:31756:11"/>
I was in bed, ſomething near me made a ſnarling
noiſe like that of Cats fighting, but ſomewhat
louder, and ſeveral times blew at my throat
very violently: I thought the wind of it ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than that which cometh from Black ſmiths
Bellows. In my Fright I fell to Prayer, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I had uttered many words in it, the ſtorm
ceaſed.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, I obſerve that the Lord exerted his
righteouſneſs many times in my Concerns. I
have often ſeen his hand pleading my Cauſe
with thoſe that injured me, and dealing ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with them, and that without my contrivance;
for I addicted not my ſelf to ſeek revenge upon
them, when I ſeemed to have ſome advantage
for it. Some that unanimouſly moleſted me
while I was Beneficed, afterwards fell out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themſelves, and ruined one another. Some
that were active in depriving me, died ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
thereupon. And the Officer that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the rude Souldiers to carry me to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
ſoon after fell out with his own Kinsfolk,
which cauſed great diſturbance in Markets by
tumultuous fightings, and in open Seſſions by
mutual Suits at Law. And near the ſame time
Twelvemonth as he ſent me to <hi>Denbigh</hi> Gaol,
he went into the great Seſſions held in the ſaid
Town, to wage Law againſt his Adverſaries,
and there in the heat of Anger was ſuddenly
diſpatcht by a violent Feaver. Others beſides
me, took notice how his Judgment in the ſight
of the County pointed at his late Oppreſſing
injury. And within two or three years after
moſt of his rude men died alſo in the prime
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:31756:12"/>
of their Age. I might give many Inſtances
more of this kind. I wiſh the reſt of my Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors
may take Example, and not be made
ſuch.</p>
            <p>Though I have not layd down here one wrong
of a hundred inflicted on me, nor one Mercy
of a Thouſand God ſhewed me, yet it may be
ſufficient (if the Lord pleaſe) that <hi>Iniquity may
ſtop her mouth,</hi> and the <hi>conſiderate underſtand the
Loving-kindneſs of the Lord:</hi> And I fear here's
more than ſome will either improve or bear at
preſent: But that in Gods time they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
Repentance and Mercy upon Examination
of their ways, ſhall be the Prayer of</p>
