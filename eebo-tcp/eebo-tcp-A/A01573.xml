            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the confluence of Bookes hath bred a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of errours, of Vices; so hard is it to
distinguish betwixt profitable and vaine
Writinges; and hauing culled out the best, so easie is it
with much good Meate to surfet; yet is not therefore Meate
vnnecessarie: It is no sober inference, because both Text
and readers haue been corrupted with false Glosses, to reiect
all Expositions, all Applications: both are fitte, this latter
most necessary; for our Vnderstanding is better then our
Conscience: there is some light in our Minds, litle warmth
in our Affections: So against Nature is it true in this, that
the essentiall qualities of Fire, Light, and Heat, are deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
and to say, whether our light of Knowledge be more,
or our heate of Deuotion lesse, is beyond me: Let this (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered)
plead for me, that I (doe but) rubbe this sowning
Knowledge in vs, to bring it backe to some life of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:

and fuller of actiue dexteritie now in the dotage of it,
then it was in the nonage: Both Pulpit &amp; Presse are weake
enough to resist it. It therfore this small Arrow of Reproofe
can wound (but euen) one of his Limbes, it shall a litle ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate

yours, and he that made it: whose Patronage, I could not be
ambitious of, if I should onely fixe my eyes on my owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruinges:
but in the affiance of your good natures, mature
iudgementes, and kind constructions of my weake endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours,
I haue presumed to make you the Patron of my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
who was freely the Patron of my selfe. I know, that
Gods word can countenaunce it selfe, and needes not the
shelter of an humaine arme, not, though it had as many
<hi>Edomites</hi> to deride it, as it hath <hi>Patrons</hi> to defende it:
But I find not onely the best Writinges of the best Men, but

I confesse, it is not all for your Protection, somewhat for

Honors, to giue it happy entertainement to your owne

them in his Chronicle, which are not heere thought of,
and leauing those out, which the world boastes of as
her glorie: to a soule that hath more Affection in her,

<hi>Cesars,</hi> honored with the graces of Nature, the bounties

yeeld them, should yet want a name in Gods Booke, a

to the eye of the world, Goodnes to the eye of Heauen:
There is a glorious splendour in pompous Honour, to
draw the eyes of admiration after it; it litle affectes the
sight of God, if Vertue giues it not a <hi>Lustre:</hi> hee that is
goodnesse and greatnesse it selfe (when others haue it

               <hi>A Burden:</hi> a matter
not easily portable, but will weigh heauie on whom so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
imposed: the Burden is in 2. respectes: 1. of the
Prophet that beare it: 2. of the People that were to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
it.</p>
            <p>1. The Word of the Lord is to the Prophets a heauy
Burden till they are deliuered of it: there is no rest in
the bones to the surcharged Conscience, no more then
to the pregnant Woman till she be eased: I confesse,
that Securitie, Vanitie, abundance of Wealth, setting
their shoulders to this Burden, make many a Prophet
forgoe all sense of the weight: <hi>Ionas</hi> loden with his
Commission for <hi>Niniueh,</hi> lay as securely in the sides of
the Shippe, as if the God of <hi>Israel</hi> had layd no Burden
on him: but himselfe was a Burden to the Shippe, and
the furie of the Waues, Windes, and his Anger that
mooues all, was not appeased, till the Shippe was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burthened
of <hi>Ionas,</hi> that had disburthened himselfe of
the Message of God. Let me speake it with griefe and
feare; We are the sonnes of those Prophets, (I meane)
their successors in Gods Ministeriall worke: and the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:483:6"/>
Word of the eternall God is no lighter a Burden to vs
then it was to them: nay let me adde (that, which is not
to be thought of without trembling) there is the Burden
of a Curse threatned to them that neglect this Burden;
<hi>Cursed is hee that doth Gods businesse negligently.</hi> Least I
should seeme bitter in applying this too generally, let
me freely speake what <hi>Paul</hi> applyes to his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
if he slighted this ponderous charge: <hi>A necessitie</hi>
(which is no lesse then a Burden) <hi>is layd vpon me, and woe

            <p>The Ministerie is a matter of both Honour and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then:

heartes, as fire shut vp in our bones, and we shall be

            <p>But alasse, sinne (which is Burden enough to sinke
the world) is made light by custome; as if resting in

<hi>What he saw in the night, &amp;c.</hi> a proude <hi>Edomite</hi> securing
himselfe the strength of his owne armes, deriding the

read other Expositions, as if it was a question of feare:
I approue and dwell on the former: from the perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
then of immunitie, impunitie, and safe standing out
of the reach of Earth,<note place="margin">Seir and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity.</note> of Hell, of Heauen, proceedes this
Question. <hi>Edom</hi> hath shaken off the yoake of <hi>Israel,</hi>
and begins to crowne his dayes with the Rose buddes
of Peace, and not to feare the Sword of <hi>Egipt,</hi> nor <hi>Ashur,</hi>
nor Gods himselfe in Heauen: their conceite was
(though faignedly) as strong of this Mount <hi>Seir,</hi> as the
promise of God was really true to Mount <hi>Syon,</hi> neuer to
be moued, though the battlementes of Heauen shotte
Thunder, and the pillars of the Earth quaked.</p>
            <p>There is question about the name of this <hi>Seir;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hierom.</note> some
affirme it deriued from <hi>Esau,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 36. 9.</note> as being the place where

many reasons; 1. because that corner of <hi>Canaan</hi> about
<hi>Hebron,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mercer.</note> where he and his brother <hi>Iacob</hi> dwelt, were too

<hi>Esau's</hi> minde,<note place="margin">Perer.</note> being a place of excellent hunting: 3. his
Wiues were of that Countrie: 4. Gods prouidence so
disposed of <hi>Esau's</hi> remouall, that <hi>Iacob</hi> might liue in safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
And euen in this, God wrought <hi>Esau's</hi> good, by
putting him out of <hi>Canaan;</hi> for then with the rest of the
<hi>Canaanites</hi> they had been destroyed by <hi>Israel;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 27. 39. 40</note> but God
made good that temporall blessing vpon <hi>Esau</hi> and his

(though deriued from <hi>Esau)</hi> were destroyed by

quench the very cinders of naturall affection, after it

            <p>But what if a Mountaine, what if a Citie, or the

            <p>The Burden of <hi>Dumah</hi> is warre, Mount <hi>Seir</hi> feares it
not: if the booke of our hearts lay open to be read, I
thinke our feare of warre is lesse then theirs. God graunt
our presumption, our securitie be not as great: <hi>Wee sitte
vnder our owne Figge-trees, and eate the fruites of our owne
Vineyards: Our Children goe out by flockes and daunces, and
flourish like the Oliue branches round about our tables: Our
Oxen are strong to labour, our Sheepe bring foorth thousands
and ten thousands in our streets: There is no leading into cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuity,
no dashyng of our Children against the stones, no complay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in our streetes.</hi> If this one blessing exceed not our
thankfulnesse for all, my obseruation is deceiued; but
what a bold inference is this? there is no warre, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
may be none, nor can we be ouerthrowne: It is a
speech as common as the stones in our streetes, when
consideration of warre is offred: <hi>Wee need feare no Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,

and priuately with coate of Armour, and coate of
Maile, assaulted the peace of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> but (praise to our
God) receiued shame in putting of their Harnesse: Let
this make vs thankefull, not secure; as if God could not
reach his arme ouer our narrow Seas: Behold <hi>France</hi>

<hi>Gen. 15. The wickednesse of the Amorites is not yet full<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.</hi>
He giues it by way of Comment; but it is a false glosse,
I trust, and carryes no more trueth with it, then other
the fictions of <hi>Rome;</hi> his wordes are these: <hi>Let no man
wonder why God suffers the persecution of the Catholikes in
England, (the sinnes of the Amorites are not yet full) their
wickednesse is not yet compleat; when it is, the diuine reuenge
shall fall:</hi> They expected this day at the last change;

I hope his Prophecie is as false for the euent, as I am

those vncircumcised <hi>Amorites,</hi> vnchristened <hi>Pagans,</hi> nor

            <p>The worke of our day, is the working vp our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation;
it is a speciall worke, Heauen &amp; our Soules are

our <hi>Saluation is not finished</hi> like Courtiers, that hauing
light to bring them to bed, play it out at Cardes, and

bringes no reioycefull ease to either spirits or corpes:

With Humilitie, Reuerence, and desire of Knowledge:
(<hi>Inter Iuuenile tuaicium, et senile praeiudicium multa veritas

false Sexton, and settes the Clocke too slow, that the
Night comes ere we be aware: tarry not then till your
piles of Vsuries, heapes of Deceites, mountaines of
Blasphemies, haue caused God to hide himselfe, and

our Repentance? neuer more need: Our sinnes are
not low, slow, few, or sleightly done; negligence sinnes,
security sinnes, contempt sinnes, presumption and
hard-heartednes sins: here is the Scorners Chaire, the
Drunkardes Bench, the Idle-mans Cushion, the Vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:483:27"/>
Studie: Oh where is Repentance, to rowse these?
God is angry; we haue been smitten, not in the Skirts
and Suburbes of our Common-wealth onely, our Citie,
Body, and whole vnitie hath been pearced to the soule,
<hi>The whole Head hath been sicke, and whole Heart heauy:</hi>
Where is the phisicke of Repentance? I can shew you
many Actors presenting themselues on the Theator of
this World; I see not Repentance play her part: I can
point you to Vsurie, robbing, grinding, sucking blood,
cutting throates, whiles he sittes in the Chimney cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
&amp; heares of his Zani's, whelpes, vnderling Theeues
ending their dayes at the Gallowes. I can shew you
Couetousnes sweating for gaine, crowching, ramping,
playing Ape, Lion, or Deuill, for Money: I can disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
to you Drunkennesse, rising early to the Wine,
Malice making haste to the death of <hi>Ammon,</hi> Ambition
running after Honour, faster then <hi>Peter</hi> to the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre;
Pride whirling in her Charriot, Wantonnes shut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
vp the windowes; Bribery creeping in at the Key<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hole,
euen when the doore of Iustice is locked vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
her. Among all these I see not repentance: Doth
she stay till the last act? I feare the tragedy of many
Soules ruine will be done first. This land is full of
sinnes, (let me speake impartially) this Citie: as many
Lines meete at the Center; so all sinnes by a generall
confluence to this place: <hi>Glomerantur in vnum innumerae
pestes Erebj:</hi> The mischiefes of Hell are swarmed to one
Crowde, and we haue it. I know there are some <hi>names
in Sardj,</hi> some that make Conscience of their wayes: the
same ayre is drawn by men of as contrary dispositions,
as is the opposition of the two Poles: that I may say of
the liues of this Citie, as one doth of <hi>Origen's</hi> writinges:
(<hi>Vbi bene, nemo melius:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Nil fuit vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>q uam sic im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par sibi. Hor.</note> 
               <hi>vbi male, nemo peius,</hi>) Those that
are good, are exceeding good, and those that are euill,
are vnmeasurable euill: nothing was euer so vnlike it
selfe. You are as contrary as fire to water; but al the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="tcp:483:28"/>
of the one's deuotion, will not quench the Fire of the
others wickednesse: This latter is so monstrously
growne on vs with the times, that it is all, if the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
of <hi>Rome,</hi> or the Atheisme of <hi>Turkey</hi> can goe beyond
it. They are rare heartes, that care not more to seeme,
then to be Holy, if perhaps, they will either seeme or
bee: Rare handes, that are free and cleane from either
blood or filthinesse: rare Tongues, that doe not vie
Oathes with Words; making scoffes, scornes, flatteries,
vaine speaches, the greater part of their tongues exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise;
that if their Words could be weighed, their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of a yeare, are not so substantiall and ponderous, as
their Oathes of one day: It were no wonder to see these
abominations in <hi>Dumah, Egipt, Babilon;</hi> to find them in
<hi>England</hi> is matter of amasement. It was an admirable and
astonishing speach (the Prophet him selfe thought, by
his aduertisement prefixed,<note place="margin">Esay.</note>) <hi>The virgin Israel hath done
filthily.</hi> If Harlots and Brothels be vnchast, they doe not
degenerate from their kind; in so pure a Virgin, no
imagination would haue dream't it. It is no newes to
find the Deuill in Hell: to haue him thrust into Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise,
tempting and preuayling with our first Parents, is
horrible. Let <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Turkey</hi> swell with the poysons
of Sathan till they burst, who wonders? to finde the
sputteringes of his venime in the Church is grieuous:
If we be accused for accusing of sinnes, let the Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

many learned men are of this opinion:</hi> But I aske him, if his

giue one hundred pound bagge, to be secured in this
poynt? Sure, it is (at the least) not safe wading farre in a
questionable Water; if it could be safe to some, yet how
many haue been drowned in this Whirlepoole? I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
that flesh and blood puts the Bladders of Wealth
and Promotion vnder their Arme-holes, and the Deuill
holdes them vp by the Chinne, till they come to the
deepest, and then, as the Priestes serued <hi>Iudas,</hi> they bid
them shift for them selues; and wanting the helpe of
Repentance of swimme, downe they sinke (<hi>In profundum
inferni</hi>) to the bottomlesse bottom of Hell. These two,
are not vnfitly compared to two Milstones; the Vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
is the nether Stone, that lyes still; he sittes at home in
his warme Furres, and spendes his time in a deuillish
Arithmeticke, in numeration of houres, dayes, and
moneys, in substraction from others estates, and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication
of his owne, till they haue diuided the earth
to themselues, and themselues to Hell: The Broker
runnes round like the vpper Mill-stone, and betwixt
both these, the poore is grinded to powder.</p>
            <p>Vsury (you say) is exploded among Saintes, I would
you would deale no worse with couetousnesse: But
alasse, this is too generall a fault, to giue any hope of
amendment: He that railed on <hi>Beelsebub</hi> pulled al <hi>Ekrom</hi> about his eares: He that sleighted <hi>Melchom,</hi> prouoked
the <hi>Ammonites:</hi> But he that condemnes <hi>Mammon,</hi>
speakes against all the world. This is the delight, the

            <p>Gluttony is not much lesse generall, no lesse euill:

            <p>The medecine to heale all this, both for Patient and

nor any thing that worketh abhomination, or lyes.</hi> Perhappes
thou wilt yet stand vpon it: produce thy witnesses:
they are onely two, thy Life, thy Conscience: they
cannot speake with thee, against their maker and thine.
Thy life speakes lowde, and plaine: Thy pride, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse,
oppression, cousenage, lustes, blasphemies,
manifest thou hast but a broken title: and <hi>Paul</hi> pleads
against thee,<note place="margin">Tit. 3. 8.</note> from this cleere aduantage: <hi>Protest to them
yee beleeue in God, that they be carefull to shew foorth good
workes.</hi> They that haue the euidence of faith, must haue
the witnes of workes: It is a poore deed, without wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.
Thy conscience speakes plaine too, that thy
faith is but a carnall perswasion, bred of securitie; a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
Euidence, made by a false Scriuener the Diuell, to
deceiue thy owne eyes and the worldes, not Gods.
Now where is thy claime? stand vpon good assurance,
lest when that subtile winnower Satan, comes to fift
thee graine after graine, thou prouest Chaffe: we may
come with this carnall perswasion, little better then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate
hope, to the Temples, to the Pulpittes to the
Sacraments, but if we come so to the tribunall of Christ,
woe vnto vs: the too much trusting to a verball, leane,
sicke, starued faith, deceiues many a Soule: whiles we
couet to be solifidians in opinion, wee prooue nullifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians
in practise: no matter for wisedome in the Soule,
grace in the conscience, honesty in the life, if the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of faith be in the tongue: but the Poore may

But alasse, in how many of vs doth sinne liue, dwell, (I

            <p>I haue read and obserued in the Historie of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
a certaine controuersie betwixt that Kingdome and
<hi>Ireland,</hi> for a little Iland that lay betweene them; eyther
claimes it as theit due, and the strife growing hotte, was
falling from wordes to blowes: but reason moderated
both sides, and they put it to the decision of a <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;</hi>
who thus iudged it: he caused lyning Serpents to
be put into that Iland; if they liued and thriued there,
he iudged it <hi>Scotlands;</hi> if they pyned and dyed, he gaue
it for <hi>Ireland.</hi> You can apply it easily: If the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Serpents, poysons, and corruptions of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
batten and thriue in vs, wee are Satans; if they
languish and consume, wee are Gods: thus is the title
ended for the freehold of our Soules, by what sure rule
wee may know, whether they belong to Hell or Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.
If our harts be vnstabled of these beastiall lusts, and
<pb facs="tcp:483:35"/>
trimmed vp with Sanctimony to entertaine our holy
Guest, there shall be a reciprocall and enterchangeable
comming of vs to Christ, and Christ to vs: and we shall
as surely <hi>suppe with him</hi> in his Court of glory,<note place="margin">Reu. 3. 20.</note> as <hi>he hath

            </p>
            <p>Let vs only feare, least our want of Repentance hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
this. I should haue earst obserued it, as a materiall
instruction from this place, I could not find a fitter
time to insert it, then here, to draw your comming
with more alacritie. There is a reseruation to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
euen to abhorred <hi>Edom:</hi> let the sonnes of the
prophanest <hi>Esau</hi> repent, and they shall not be forsaken
of mercie: <hi>Returne and come,</hi> and your night threatned,
shall be made a ioyfull warning, though it had as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
&amp; defined a time, as euer had <hi>Ionas</hi> doome against
<hi>Niniueh,</hi> the sett bounds of 40. dayes, with a <hi>Non vltra:</hi>
yet be you humbled and this iudgement shall be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed
with: If there be such mercie to <hi>Edom,</hi> let me
say boldly, repenting <hi>Israell</hi> shall not faile of it: the
night shall linger, and the Sun be kept from setting, if
wee will returne in our day: the threatnings of God
haue a condition included; that generall, that promised,
that neuer refused interposition of repentance. As ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
as the speech might seeme to <hi>Abimelech,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
<hi>Abrahams</hi> wife, <hi>thou art but a dead man,</hi> yet it
had an implicite condition, <hi>except thou restore her vndefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,</hi>
as appeares by the sequele. It is a common Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
where at euery repentant soule may drinke, <hi>at
what time soeuer, what sinner</hi> soeuer, <hi>repent</hi> of what sinne
soeuer, &amp;c. And if yet any feele themselues thirsty,
weake, and not throughly resolued, let him for euer
confute the distrust of his owne heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the malice of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,
the present difficulties,<note place="margin">Ier. 18 7.</note> with that of <hi>Ieremiah,</hi>
Where in expresse wordes, our repentaunce is sayd to

Plagues.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:483:35"/>God hath threatned to all sinners, a Night of sorrow,
and it shall as surely come, as euer Euening succeeded
day: but there is an <hi>Except,</hi> that shall saue vs, a seasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and substantiall repentance: if we turne from those
winding Labyrinths of sinne, and come home to God,
hee will saue vs from this Night, that wee perish not:
there is no comming to God, but in &amp; by Iesus Christ;
through his Sonne must God looke at vs, and wee at
him; that he may be mercifull, we hopefull.</p>
            <p>Come then beloued, to Iesus Christ: behold him
with the eyes of Fayth, standing on the Battlementes
of Heauen, and wafting you to him: come freely, come
merrily, come with speede; come betimes, least when
you would, you cannot for want of direction, dare not
for want of acquaintance with him: he that comes not
till the last gaspe of extremitie, knowes not how to
come, because he begins but then. How prone are our
feete to forbidden pathes? the Flesh calles, we come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Vanitie calles, we flocke: the World calles, we flye:
Let Christ call earely and late, and either we not come,
or vnwillingly, or late, or with no purpose to stay.
How iustly may he take vp that complaint against vs,
that against the <hi>Iewes:</hi> after all my Promises, assurances,

of sinne and sinne of vs, then let God take vs; hee will

            <p>A certaine Gallant had three Friendes: two of them
flatter'd him in his loose humours; if in this, I may
not rather call them Enemies: The third, louingly des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
him from his follies: on the two flatterers, he
spent his Patrimony; the third he castes off with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt:
his ryot and wealth gone, his Friendes went
too; for they were friendes to the Riches, not to the
Rich man: Debt was required, hee arrested, and the
Prison not to be auoyded: in this calamitie, he studies
refuge; hence bethinkes himselfe of his two Friends,
of whom he desires reliefe: the first's answere is cold
and short, <hi>Alas, I can not spare it, you should haue preuented
this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>arst:</hi> The other speakes a litle more comfort; <hi>I haue
no Money to helpe you,</hi> yet I will beare you company to
the Prison-doare, and there leaue you: The distressed
man findes small satisfaction in all this; therefore as
his last refuge, hee calles to minde his third Friend,
whom he had euer scorned, wronged; and after much
wrastling betwixt shame and necessitie, hee sendes to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:483:36"/>
him, with no lesse earnestnesse, then humilitie, discouers
his exigents, requires helpe: the Message scarce deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered,
hee comes with speed, payes the Debt, sets him
at libertie, nay repayres the ruines of his estate. The
Rioter, is Man; the two flattering Friends, are Riches
and Pleasures; these the soule of man embraceth,
spends her strength and time, most precious Riches, on
them: The third Friend, that rebukes his sinnes, is
Christ; this because distastefull to blood and flesh,
without regard to his sauing health, is reiected: at last,
all the time of Grace spent, the soule (so farre) in Gods
debt, is arrested by one of Gods Serieants, Sicknesse,
or Calamitie, or an afflicted Conscience; then those
Friends begin to slinke; Pleasure is gone sodainely,
so soone as the Head begins to ake: Riches (perhaps)
will offer to goe with him to the Prison doare the gates
of Death, the preparation to the Graue: the fainting
Soule fore-seeing their falshood, weakenesse, aggraua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his miseries; with an humbled Heart, remorse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Conscience, Teares in his eyes, Prayers and Cryes
in his tongue, sollicites his neglected Sauiour, to pittie
his distresse, and haue mercie vpon him: these Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
haue no sooner pierced the Heauens, but downe
comes the spirit of Grace and Mercie, with Pardon
and free Remission, payment of all Debts, &amp; discharge
of all Sorrowes.</p>
