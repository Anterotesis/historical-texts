            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A PROPOSAL
For the Erecting of
County Regiſters, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>A Motion being made in the Houſe of Commons in the Reign
of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> for leave to bring in a Bill to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit
<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury,</hi> a great States-man then in the Houſe oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
it, and concluded his Arguments for the continuance
of it, with this memorable Aphoriſm, <hi>Let any Man ſhew
me a Country without <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury, and I will ſhew him one without Trade or Riches.</hi>
Than which none of the Mathematical Principles are more certain, or
ſelf-evident.</p>
            <p>True it is in the mean time, that no ſort of Men are, or deſerved to
be more odious than the <hi>Griping <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurer;</hi> but then it is the abuſe of the
thing that makes him ſo. Let him take a reaſonable Intereſt for his
Money, and treat the Men he deals with fairly, and upon the Square, and
no Man deſerves more Love than he. But this is ſo hard to be expected
from that ſort of Men, that they are feared and ſuſpected before they
are guilty of any ill thing. The Truſt they give is too often abuſed,
and that often makes them think of taking Reprizals upon the reſt of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
that have not injured them; and the diſtruſt they ſhew is in ſome
ſort juſtified by the ill Actions of needy and deſigning Men, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
what they are not, both for Colour and Subſtance, Honeſty and
Ability.</p>
            <p>This is it that makes <hi>Banks</hi> and <hi>Regiſters</hi> for Lands ſo neceſſary, that
the Lender may have a certainty to receive his own again with Profit,
and the Borrower, being delivered from the suspicion of Fraud, or ill
Deſigns, may not pay for other Mens Perfidy and Breach of Truſt. As
to the ſeveral <hi>Banks</hi> now erected I am not againſt them, they may
have their Uſe as to ſome Men: But to turn all the Riches of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
into theſe Channels, muſt of Neceſſity ruin the Nobility and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of this Nation; becauſe they will poſſeſs at all times ſuch a Maſs
of Treaſure, that no one ſingle Man, how great ſoever, can defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
againſt their united Purſe and Intereſt. And when they have ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined
a few to ſhew their Power, they will become ſo terrible to the
reſt, that there will be no other Remedy, but to Petition them for
Mercy; a Virtue not often found in ſingle Perſons, but much rarer in
Bodies of Men; who dividing or ſharing the infamy of an ill Action,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:29802:3"/>
account each Man's Share of it ſo ſmall, that it is not worth regarding;
and the rather, becauſe every <hi>individuum</hi> of the whole Maſs will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to have had no hand in it, and to be againſt what the whole doth,
and then the Poets Queſtion is eaſily admitted; <hi>Quid ſalvis infamia Nummis?</hi>
Who would not be infamous to be rich?</p>
            <p>The Way between theſe Rocks on the Right and Left Hand is, the
opening <hi>County Regiſters;</hi> Thoſe of ſingle Mannors being too ſmall, and
thoſe of the whole, or a great part of the Nation, too big both for
the Government, and them that are to deal with them. In theſe lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Banks</hi> a Man is forced to put the Title of his Eſtate into the Hands
of unknown Men before he can be truſted; and then is truſted no
farther, nor longer than they think fit; becauſe, like a Bird, they have
him in their Talons, and can cruſh him when they pleaſe; and if he
once falls (and who may not?) into the Hands of theſe his Maſters,
he cannot deliver himſelf, and no Man elſe will dare to do it. But in
a County Regiſter, the Title as well as Poſſeſſion of the Eſtate, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
in the proper Owner till he willingly parts with it, or is by Law,
for good Cauſes diveſted of it; and he has only his own Creditors to
deal with, and if they become unreaſonable, he may pay them off, and
be take himſelf to others that will treat him better.</p>
            <p>All that can be alledged for the <hi>Bank</hi> is, That this is but <hi>ſurmize of what
may be, but has never happened.</hi> True it is, they are now like the riſing
Sun, pleaſant and eaſie to all; but if they are once got up to the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
heighth of Power, and ſetled, then will their <hi>ſcorching</hi> Heat be
felt like the other, but much greater than the <hi>Libyan Ardors,</hi> which
reach not far into the parched Earth; but theſe will penetrate to the
Bowels, and fire the Intrails of thoſe Lands and Owners, which lie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their torrid Influence, till they become unhabitable as to their preſent
Poſſeſſors.</p>
            <p>Yet in the preſent Circumſtances, what ſhould miſerable Men do?
The griping <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurer</hi> hovers over them, juſt ready to ſeize upon them;
and theſe Dolphins are gaping under them, to catch them in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent;
and a Prey they muſt fall, ſooner or later, to one of them, if
the Mercy of our Repreſentatives in Parliament do not deliver theſe
perſecuted Men.</p>
            <p>The Method I propoſe is none of my Invention; one Mr. <hi>Yarrington,</hi>
about twenty Years agone, firſt offered it to the Conſideration of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and ſince that time it has ever been debated: Deſired by all that
had need of it, and oppoſed by the reſt, upon very different Grounds
and Reaſons without doubt, but thoſe alledged publickly, none of the
beſt; and in truth it has ſome Inconveniences, which I ſhall mention per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
in the cloſe of this Paper.</p>
            <p>But there is one Reaſon ariſing from the preſent Circumſtances of the
Nation, that, I hope, is ſtrong enough to ſurmount all the Difficulties
that are raiſed or pretended to ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ruct it; Men have ſtruggled as long
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:29802:3"/>
as they can, and if the Nation will not take care of them, they will take the
beſt care they can of themſelves, which is the Voice of theſe <hi>Voluntary
Banks;</hi> the Miſchief of which I have hinted at. Theſe going on, will in
length of time do all that the County Regiſters would have done, but to
the damage of the Nation, eſpecially of the Gentry and landed Men. The
old Methods, and Law-maxims were well enough two or three hundred
years agone, when we made no other uſe of our ſmall Ships but Fiſhing and
Tranſporting our Forces into <hi>France:</hi> When the elder Son was a Captain,
and all the younger Sons Soldiers under him or ſome other great Man. Then
<hi>Lands pay no Debts</hi> was a prudent Provision for the Preſervation of Families;
but it has ruined more in the laſt Century than it has preſerved; for it
they pay no Debts they deſerve no Credit; and cannot be uſeful in the way
of Trade, the much better way of imploying the younger Children than
that of ſending them into the Field to be returned back Beggars and Cripples
for the remainder of their wretched Lives.</p>
            <p>Trade is now become the Darling of Mankind, and if the <hi>French Leviathan</hi>
did not make War neceſſary would have beat our Swords into Plow-ſhares,
and our Spears into Pruning-hooks, the much more uſeful and humane In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments,
which are attended with the Bleſſing of God and Man; whilſt
the fruitleſs Lawrels of the proudeſt Victors have ever been deeply dren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
in Blood and Tears, and at laſt blaſted by the Curſes of both. But
then <hi>Trade</hi> and <hi>Truſt</hi> are ſuch Reciprocals, Correlatives each to other, that
they muſt ſtand and fall together: Without <hi>Truſt</hi> there can be no <hi>Trade,</hi>
and without <hi>Trade</hi> there will not be much <hi>Wealth,</hi> the Foundation of <hi>Truſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Were any thing to be impoſed upon the reſt of the Nation, it were no
wonder if it met with oppoſition, but all that is deſired is a bare Permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for ſuch as pleaſe to Regiſter their Free-hold Lands, their Quantity and
Quality, and the Values and Titles of them, that all Mankind may know
what Incumbrances are upon them, and how far they may with ſafety re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon them by way of Mortgage or Purchaſe, for the Payment of the
Debts now upon them, and the Support of the Publick Charges, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
for younger Children, and the promoting thereby the Trade and
Commerce of the Nation; which ſeems not poſſible to be carried on with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſuch an Aſſiſtance, but be ſure cannot ſo well be done without it.</p>
            <p>As ſome Families, ſo perhaps ſome Counties may not have an equal need
or ſence of this benefit: Let but the <hi>South-Eaſtern</hi> Counties that border near
upon <hi>London, Eſſex, Hertfordſhire, Cambridgeſhire, Suffolk,</hi> and <hi>Norfolk,</hi> &amp;c.
have this Liberty, and let the reſt that deſire it not, be left in <hi>ſtatu quo,</hi> till
they ſee how thoſe that deſire it fare, and then do as they think fit.</p>
            <p>Having thus, by way of Introduction, a little opened my way, I come
now to the thing mainly intended, and to ſhew my Thoughts upon
it, with the Reaſons of them, that ſo others may the better judge of them.
And firſt, The Reaſons why I prefer County Regiſters before one Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Regiſter in <hi>London</hi> (which yet might perhaps do well enough for thoſe
Counties that border near upon <hi>London</hi>) is firſt,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:29802:4"/>
1. For the diſperſing the Wealth, the Vital Blood of a State, proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
alike to all the parts of the Body Politick; that ſome may not be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-nouriſhed,
and others ſtarved, but that this nutritive Juice may be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
where, and near at hand to ſerve all Mens emergent Neceſſities.</p>
            <p>2. That the <hi>Borrower</hi> and <hi>Lender</hi> may the more eaſily tranſact their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
and be known each to other; which is a great Foundation of that
mutual Truſt and Confidence that ought to be between them.</p>
            <p>3. For the more eaſie knowledge of the Quantity, Quality and Value of
the Lands that are to be the Funds upon which the Truſt is built, theſe
to many of the Creditors will be known before-hand; and as to the reſt,
with ſmall Expence, may be viewed and enquired into; which is difficult
to be done in remote and very diſtant Counties, which much alters the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of Lands.</p>
            <p>4. For the more eaſie Payment of Intereſt whilſt the Truſt continues,
and of the Principal when it is to be paid in, to me it ſeems but reaſonable,
the Borrower and the Lender ſhould live like Man and Wife together,
that they may have an Eye upon each others Demeanour, but with the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of taking out a Bill of Divorce in cauſe of <hi>Jealouſie</hi> on either
ſide.</p>
            <p>5. And to that purpoſe I would have it as eaſie for them to part as it
was at firſt to meet; if there is in the ſame County a Center in which all the
Money and much of the Lands may meet, where the borrower will ſeldom
fail of what he wants, and the Lender as rarely be long without a Cuſtomer for
his Money: So that a Man may pay a Debt when he pleaſe, without any
injury to his Creditor: The want of which liberty has been the ruin of
many a Family, and therefore ought to be taken care of.</p>
            <p>6. Not only great, but ſmall Sums may be lodged here, which will be a
means to bring many a Family out of Debt. I have known a good Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
borrow an Hundred Pound of five ſeveral Men, and pay them all
off one after another, that could never have paid an Hundred Pound at
one ſingle Payment. And this may eaſily be done in a County Regiſter,
but is not poſſible to be done in a general one.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Regiſter.</hi> Next the Place, the Perſon, or the <hi>Regiſter</hi> that is to be
truſted, is of principal concern; and, I think, he ought to
be a Gentleman of good Education, and of an Eſtate of two, three, or four
Hundred Pound Lands the Year within the County, that he may be above
the Temptation or Suſpicion of doing mean and unworthy things; and that
he may have wherewith to anſwer it, if he ſhall knowingly be guilty of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Fraud or Cheat, that Men may the more willingly truſt him with the
Cuſtody of their Writings, and of theſe precious <hi>Records.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet I think it were convenient, that he ſhould not be a practiſing Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer,
but rather an Underſtanding and right honeſt Gentleman, that ſcorns
to trick or be trick'd, and will do right to the Pooreſt and the Richeſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any reſpect of Perſons: Altho' there is not many ſuch, yet ſome ſuch
may be found in every County.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:29802:4"/>
This Perſon may at firſt be choſen by the body of the Free-men of the
County, having Lands and Tenements to the value of 20, 30, 40, or 50 <hi>l.</hi>
the Year, it being too great a Concern to be committed to the Cottagers
of a County, Men that have not Diſcretion to chooſe wiſely; nor very
often will they be ruled by them that have: So that as the great Concern
is that of the great Free-holders, they only ought to chooſe the Man they
will truſt with their Eſtates: And this Regiſter ought to be for Life, if
he be not found guilty of any thing that he ſhall deſerve to be diſpla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
for.</p>
            <p>But when the Regiſter is once eſtabliſhed, then the Election ought to be
made only by thoſe Free-holders whoſe Eſtates are regiſtred, and not by
them who have no intereſt in the Perſon or Office. For what reaſon is it ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Man, who has neither Lands nor Writings in the Office, ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedle
with that he is not concerned in: And if any Man ſhould preſume
to give his Vote not being qualified as above, not only his Vote ſhould
go for nothing, but he deſerves to be proſecuted and fined for invading
the Property of his Neighbours; nor is it poſſible too great a care ſhould
be taken in this Affair.</p>
            <p>The Election in all other things may be managed like that of the Kinghts
of the Shire by the Sheriff in the County Court by Majority of ſuch Voices<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and the Election determined by the Sheriff and principal Gentry then
aſſembled, and declared by a Pair of Indentures, one part to be filed in
the high Court of <hi>Chancery,</hi> and the other in the County Regiſter, which
is to be the Regiſters Commiſſion. And if it be required, a Poll and Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny
admitted, than no doubt may be of the Majority of Voices.</p>
            <p>Being thus elected, a very ſtrict Oath may be given him by the Clerk of
the Peace, in the Preſence of the Sheriff and Gentry there preſent, for the
true, impartial and faithful Adminiſtration of the ſaid Office towards all
concerned alike.</p>
            <p>Being thus conſtituted, he may have the Authority of a Judge of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord;
and nothing that is entred or ſigned by him to be diſputed as to the
Fact in Law or Equity; and, I think, he might be allowed to take Recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zances
for ſecurity of Money, with the Aſſiſtance, and in the Preſence of
two or three Perſons of good Worth and Quality; and to ſtate Accounts,
and do all other Acts commonly done by the Maſters in <hi>Chancery;</hi> one of which
in extraordinary, it were convenient he ſhould ever be reputed to be in the
ſaid County, by Virtue of the Act that appoints the Office.</p>
            <p>The Methods of the keeping and the entering the Lands and Tenements
in this Regiſter, may be the ſame that is now uſed in <hi>Fines</hi> and <hi>Recoveries;</hi>
that is, with the ſame Brevity and Perſpicuity, reciting the Quantity,
Quality, Value of the Lands, and in whoſe Occupation they then are, and
in what Towns they lie. And this may be done in a few Words; and
in the Cloſe, what Title the Claiment hath, and what Incumbrances there
are upon it. And if no more be proved within ſix Months after the ſaid
Entry, then that to be the Title and State of the Lands ſo entered, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:29802:5"/>
for the future no charge to be brought upon them but what ſhall be
there entred, and in the order they are there entred, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>All the Principal Evidences alſo, or Deeds relating to the Lands ſo
entred, may at firſt, at leaſt, be left in the Cuſtody of the Regiſter till
the Title is by the Act fixed, or Tranſcripts of them to be declared by
Law, of equal Authority with the Originals; and ever after, one Deed
ſigned and ſealed by all the Parties, that recourſe may be had to it as often
as there is occaſion; which will alſo be a means of preſerving Deeds, in
caſe of Fires or other ſuch Accidents.</p>
            <p>In caſe of non-payment, the Regiſter, after ſummoning the Party con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
to deliver the Poſſeſſion to the Creditors, without any other Suit
in Law or Equity: Which would much encreaſe the Value of Lands ſo
entered, when the Creditor is ſure to recover his own again, with ſmall
Charge, and no Hazard.</p>
            <p>The Regiſter alſo to have power to receive both the Uſe and Principal
in caſe of any difference between the Lender and the Borrower, after the
Methods of the <hi>King's Bench,</hi> having firſt ſummoned the Lender to ſhew
cauſe why the Money ſhould not be paid in and the Security diſcharged:
And the Money being ſo paid in, to lie in the Office till the Lender will take
it out, or diſpoſe of it otherwiſe; the Borrower in the mean time being as
fully diſcharged both in Law and Equity, as if the Lender had received the
Money and acquitted him.</p>
            <p>The Regiſter being thus to be truſted, ought to be accountable for all his
Servants and under Officers, but not for Fire, Thieves or War, if he
has taken the beſt care he can to ſecure what is depoſited in his Hands.</p>
            <p>Or if it be thought too much to truſt the Regiſter both with the Money
and the Records of this Regiſter, then there may be a Treaſurer appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the Money, and the other be only the Keeper of the Records<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But
then the uniting them in one Perſon comes the neareſt to the nature of a
Bank, and no Man that diſtruſts him will be under any neceſſity of putting
or leaving his Money in his Hands: So that the Truſt, if any be, will be
purely voluntary.</p>
            <p>There is nothing to be entred after the firſt Entry but the Mortgages;
Sales or Aſſignments made upon any Eſtate, which ought always to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to the firſt Entry, till the right of the whole or any part is aſſigned,
and paſſed over to another, and then to begin <hi>de novo,</hi> as with a new
Proprietor.</p>
            <p>No Mortgage, Jointure, Judgment, or Recognizance to be taken or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
in other Order, but that of the time when they are entred into the
Regiſter; and to take place only upon the Remainder after all the Prior
Creditors are paid both Uſe and Principal.</p>
            <p>When any Entry is to be made of Lands or Tenements, the ſame ſhall
be drawn up by the Council of the Poſſeſſor in Paper; and then be tranſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
fairly into the Regiſter's Book, which ſhall be of Vellum, or very good
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:29802:5"/>
ment, fairly and ſtrongly bound for continuance: And the Party that
makes the Entry ſhall have a Copy of it in Vellum ſigned by the Regiſter,
without any Raſure or Interlineation. And if afterwards any ſuch thing
appear in any Copy, it ſhall be taken for falſe, if it differ from the Entry
in the Book.</p>
            <p>This Book ought to be in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and written in a fair Hand that is known
to all Men, that every Man that can write and read may underſtand his
own Copy.</p>
            <p>The Entry of any Money lent, to be in ſome ſuch ſhort Form as
this:</p>

            <p>To prevent any poſſibility of Fraud, a Copy of the Entry ſhall be given
both to the Borrower and the Lender, exactly compared and examined by the
Book, and interchangeably ſigned by both Parties, and alſo by the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
and his Clerk; the ſame to be indented.</p>
            <p>The Regiſter to have 5 <hi>s.</hi> for every Entry made in the ſaid Book, under,

10 <hi>s.</hi> for two hundred Pounds, and ſo onward; the greateſt Sum to be
50 <hi>s.</hi> and no more to be paid for any Entry whatſoever.</p>
            <p>To have 10 <hi>s.</hi> for every Tranſcript to be taken out, beſides the Charge
of the Copy, for ſearching and permitting the ſame to be tranſcribed. But
if there be only a Search, and no Tranſcript, then 5 <hi>s.</hi> only to be paid.</p>
            <p>That Liberty may be given to any Mortgagee or Lender to enter his Right
to any Free-hold Eſtate upon any Mortgage entered before the paſſing of
the Act, though the Owner of the Land has not, or will not, enter or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter
his Lands: And all Mortgages that are thus entred in the firſt ſix
Months after the Office is opened, to paſs according to their Dates, but to
be preferred before any Mortgage, of what date ſoever it is, that is not
entred within the ſix Months, except the Mortgage prove, that at that time
he was beyond the Seas.</p>
            <p>To prevent Surprizes, it may be fit that all the Free-hold Lands, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into the Regiſter, be fixed upon the Market-Croſs of the next Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-Town
to the Lands aforeſaid, and alſo in the Pariſh Church; and that
Liſts of all Perſons that ſhall ſo regiſter their Lands, be every Term hung
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:29802:6"/>
up in <hi>minſter-Hall,</hi> ſo that all the World that can be any way concern'd
in thoſe Lands may have knowledge of it.</p>
            <p>That it may be declared Felony, without benefit of Clergy, for any
Man to regiſter as his own another Man's Lands; and that no Man be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,

            <p>No Debt or other Incumbrance to be entred upon any Lands in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter
but in the preſece of the Owner, or of an Attorney at Law, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized
ſo to do by the Warrant of the Owner, under his Hand and Seal,
atteſted by three Witneſſes, and ſigned and certified to be true, by the
next Juſtice of the Peace, to the Proprietor or Owner of the Land, and
all this made good by the Affidavit of the Attorney ſworn before the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter,
and filed in the ſaid Office. And the Attorney that ſhall make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
falſe Entry to ſuffer as in Caſe of Felony.</p>
            <p>Amongſt the many Objections made againſt theſe publick Regiſters, one is,
that it will expoſe the Condition of every Man's Eſtate to all the World.
This will in great part be prevented by the Prudence of the Regiſter,
whoſo Intereſt it will be to have the Love of all thoſe that are in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter,
that it may grow, and with it his Profit. And yet he may by Law
be bound not to expoſe the Condition of any Man's Eſtate, but by his own
conſent, and to ſuch only as are to purchaſe or lend Money upon the ſame,
and ſuch part only as they are to be concerned with.</p>
            <p>The Regiſter ought alſo to have a competent Allowance for all Searches
Certificates, and Letters by him written or made, for the ſatisfaction of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Perſon that is to purchaſe or lend any Money upon any Eſtate that is
entred in the ſaid Regiſter.</p>
            <p>Beſides the Fees that will be fit to be allowed to the Regiſter, it will be
but reaſonable, that ſome ſmall Fees ſhould be allowed to Clerks imployed
to draw up Copies, Bonds, Recognizances, Affidavits, and other ſuch-like
Writings, which will be of frequent uſe; and theſe Fees may be regulated
by the Juſtices of the Peace in their Quarter Seſſion, and Tables ſigned by
them and the Regiſter be hung up in the Office, that every Man may be
certain what he is to pay. And alſo all rules of Practice, Bye-Laws and
Orders, ought to be hung up, and the ſame Method be uſed by and towards
all that are to tranſact any thing in the ſaid Office.</p>
            <p>The beſt place to fix this Office in, is the County-Town, or ſome other
great place to which the Attorneys reſort once in every Month for the
holding the Sheriff's Court; and by conſequence this Affair may be then
diſpatched without making a Journey to no other purpoſe.</p>
            <p>The larger the Bounds of the Office is, the leſs will the Fees of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter
be; whereas, if his Bounds are ſmall, he muſt have the greater Fees
to make up a Sum worth his while: And it is the cheapneſs and facility of
procuring Money, that is the Benefit deſigned to the Borrower, as Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
and Security is to the Lender. If we can gain theſe two Points, the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:29802:6"/>
principal Benefit of Lands is gained, which is to make the a Funds for
carrying on the Trade of the Nation to the publick and private Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.</p>
            <p>That in caſe of any Misfeaſance a Complaint, Bill or Information may
be filed againſt the <hi>Regiſter</hi> in the publick Aſſizes for the County by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
part of the Grand-Jury for the ſaid County; at which the <hi>Regiſter</hi> ſhall
ever be obliged to be preſent, and to which he ſhall immediately plead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and the next following Aſſizes the thing ſhall be heard and tried by the
next Grand-Jury: The <hi>Judge</hi> and the <hi>Bench,</hi> who ſhall have a full and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Power agreeing altogether (for each of them is ſuppoſed to have a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
Voice) to diſcharge the ſaid Regiſter from his Employment, or to
fine him as they think fit, without any Appeal to any other Court whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.
And no Complaint ſhall be received againſt the Regiſter as concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Office, but in the Aſſizes of the ſame County. It may be preſumed
ill Men will bear ill will againſt a Perſon that is ſuppoſed to have Power to
force them to be honeſt, contrary to their Inclination. And when the
Office is once ſetled, and appeareth to have any Profit in it, then Envy,
Covetouſneſs, and all the other ill Humours of Men will work powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
againſt him to get him out that ſome factious and popular Man may
get into the place; againſt all which the utmoſt care is to be taken to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
an honeſt Man without encouraging a Knave (if ſuch an one ſhould
happen to get in) to hope for impunity.</p>
            <p>The ſame Free-holders may, if they think fit, chooſe a Treaſurer beſides,
the Regiſter, to take care of all Moneys lodged for the ſaid Office, or
paid into it; and then the Regiſter will only be charged with the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Records of the ſaid Office. In this Office all Deeds and Wills,
relating to Free-hold Eſtates eſpecially, might alſo be recorded for the
preſervation of them.</p>
            <p>All that is deſired is but this, that all that will may have liberty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter
their Free-hold Lands and Tenements, to aſcertain the Titles and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrances
that are upon them; and not that any Man that needs it not
ſhould be compelled ſo to do. And that any Man that has entred his
Lands, may withdraw the ſame again as ſoon as he has diſcharged all the
Debts that were due upon it; there being nothing deſigned but the ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Purchaſers and Lenders.</p>
            <p>This would have theſe good Effects:</p>
            <p>1. It would make the Titles of Free-hold Eſtates as certain as that of
the Copy-holds; of which there is no certainty now by reaſon of latent
Deeds.</p>
            <p>2. It would prevent Frauds in Buying and Selling, Borrowing and
Lending. The Borrower could not impoſe upon the Lender, becauſe his
Eſtate would appear in the Regiſter as it was: Nor could the Lender im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:29802:7"/>
any hard Terms upon the Borrower, becauſe he would be able, in
a ſhort time, to pay him off, and transfer the Debt to another Man.</p>
            <p>3. This would certainly lower the Intereſt of Money; encreaſe Trade
and Husbandry.</p>
            <p>And if Liberty were given to transfer the Copies, the Money lent might
be aſſigned from one Man to another, as the Bank Bills are: So that in
time it would be a kind of County-Bank; and Money there lodged would
be better ſecured than in any private Man's Houſe whereſoever.</p>
            <p>4. The ſmalleſt Summ, even to five Pound, might have Land Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and the pooreſt Borrower, or Lender, an eaſie, cheap, and ſpeedy
Juſtice.</p>
            <p>There can nothing be ſo wiſely contrived but it will be attended with
ſome Inconveniences; and I will moſt readily grant this has many and great
Inconveniences which will follow upon the ſetling of it, the Proſpect of
which hath hitherto prevented the obtaining this deſired Liberty.</p>
            <p>1. This will prevent great numbers of Law-Suits, for which there will
then be no occaſion, frequent Fines, Procuration and Continuation Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;
which will bring great loſs to the Lawyers and Money-Scriveners,
and to ſome of the moſt thriving Uſurers.</p>
            <p>2. It will diſcover thoſe Men that have mortgaged their Lands two,
three, or more times over, and perhaps for more than they are worth.</p>
            <p>3. It will reduce the greater Uſurers to moderation and fair dealings.</p>
            <p>I do therefore expect all theſe Men will oppoſe it to the utmoſt, as it
is their Intereſt to do: For though they cannot take away the Integrity of
an honeſt Man, yet great care is to be taken it may not be known which
are ſuch. For when <hi>Knaves</hi> are once detected they are undone; and by
them the Lawyer, Money-Scrivener, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> get all their Wealth.</p>
