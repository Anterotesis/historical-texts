         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

The Right Honourable
CHARLES,
Earl of Dorſet and Middleſex, One
of the Lords Juſtices of England,
Knight of the Moſt Noble Order
of the Garter, &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Was oblig'd to Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
for the firſt ſight I had of
this Poem; Your Lordſhip
was then pleas'd to expreſs ſome
<pb facs="tcp:49848:4"/>
Commendation of it. Since that
time I have waited an Opportunity
of getting it Publiſh'd in a more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
and portable Volume; the
Subject-matter being of that Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
to every Perſon, as requir'd its
being made a Manual for People to
carry about them. Nor can my
Pains and Care herein be unaccepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to Your Lordſhip, who are not
only the Patron of the Muſes, but of
Publick Good in all kinds.</p>
            <p>The Book has a juſt Claim to
Your Lordſhip's Protection, both
for the Solidity of Judgment, and
extraordinary Genius that appear in
it. 'Tis the Portraicture of a <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb facs="tcp:49848:4"/>
Soul</hi> in the Perfection of its Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
and Operations (ſo far as its
preſent State is capable of,) which
naturally directed me where I ought
to preſent it.</p>
            <p>But as Juſtice engag'd me in this
Addreſs, I muſt upon all Occaſions
confeſs my Obligations to Your
Lordſhip, and particularly for pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
me in His Majeſty's Service; a
Favour which I had not the Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to ſeek. I was conſcious how
ſhort I came of my Predeceſſors in
Performances of Wit and Diverſion;
and therefore, as the beſt means I had
of juſtifying Your Lordſhip's Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
employ'd my Self in publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:49848:5"/>
ſuch Poems as might be uſeful
in promoting Religion and Morality.
But how little I have conſulted my
immediate Intereſt in ſo doing, I am
ſeverely ſenſible. I engaged in the
Service of the Temple at my own
Expence, while Others made their
profitable Markets on the Stage.</p>
            <p>This, I confeſs, may ſeem im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper
in a Dedication, eſpecially
where I have ſo large a Field of
Panegyrick before me. But Your
Lordſhip's Character, by Conſent of
Mankind, is above all our Encomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums;
and Perſons of greateſt Worth
and Accompliſhments are always
leaſt fond of their own Praiſes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:49848:5"/>
I ſhall therefore only mention the
buſineſs of my preſent Waiting on
Your Lordſhip. I have here got a
uſeful Poem Reprinted, and beg to
have it Recommended to every Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy's
peruſal by Your Lordſhip's
Acceptance of it; deſiring only from
its Readers the ſame Candour Your
Lordſhip has been pleas'd to uſe, in
making ſome Allowances for the time
in which it was written. Nor will
the Author often have Occaſion for
Favour; in the main he will need
only to have Juſtice done him.</p>
            <p>But I will not foreſtal the buſineſs
of the enſuing Preface, written by an
Ingenious and Learned Divine; who
<pb facs="tcp:49848:6"/>
has both done Right to the great
<hi>Manes</hi> of the Author, and made ſome
Amends for this Unpoliſh'd Addreſs
from me, who am only Ambitious of
profeſſing my ſelf with utmoſt Zeal

            <head>PREFACE
TO
Sir John Davies's Poem.</head>
            <p>THERE is a natural Love and Fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in <hi>Engliſh</hi>-men for whatever was
done in the Reign of Q. <hi>Elizabeth;</hi>
we look upon her Time as our Golden Age; and
the Great Men who lived in it, as our chiefeſt
Hero's of Virtue, and greateſt Examples of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
Courage, Integrity and Learning.</p>
            <p>Among many others, the Author of this Poem
merits a laſting Honour; for, as he was a moſt
Eloquent Lawyer, ſo, in the Compoſition of this
Piece, we admire him for a good Poet, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
<pb facs="tcp:49848:7"/>
Philoſopher. 'Tis not Rhyming that makes
a Poet, but the true and impartial repreſenting
of Virtue and Vice, ſo as to inſtruct Mankind in
Matters of greateſt Importance. And this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
has been made of our Countrymen, That
Sir <hi>John Suckling</hi> wrote in the moſt Courtly and
Gentleman-like Style; <hi>Waller</hi> in the moſt ſweet
and flowing Numbers; <hi>Denham</hi> with the moſt
Accurate Judgment and Correctneſs; <hi>Cowley</hi>
with Pleaſing Softneſs, and Plenty of Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
None ever utter'd more Divine Thoughts
than Mr. <hi>Herbert;</hi> none more Philoſophical than
Sir <hi>John Davies.</hi> His Thoughts are moulded
into eaſie and ſignificant Words; his Rhymes never
miſlead the Senſe, but are led and govern'd by
it: So that in reading ſuch Uſeful Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances,
the Wit of Mankind may be refin'd from
its Droſs, their Memories furniſh'd with the
beſt Notions, their Judgments ſtrengthen'd,
and their Conceptions enlarg'd, by which
means their Mind will be rais'd to the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Ideas it is capable of in this Degenerate
State.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:49848:7"/>
But as others have labour'd to carry out our
Thoughts, and to entertain them with all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Delights Abroad; 'Tis the peculiar Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of this Author, that he has taught us
(with <hi>Antoninus</hi>) to meditate upon our ſelves;
that he has diſclos'd to us greater Secrets at Home;
Self-Reflection being the only Way to Valuable
and True Knowledge, which conſiſts in that rare
Science of a Man's Self, which the Moral Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher
loſes in a Crowd of Definitions, Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
and Diſtinctions: The Hiſtorian cannot find
it amongſt all his Muſty Records, being far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
acquainted with the Tranſactions of a 1000
years paſt, than with the preſent Age, or with
Himſelf: The Writer of Fables and Romances
wanders from it, in following the Deluſions of a
Wild Fancy, Chimera's and Fictions that do not
only exceed the Works, but alſo the Poſſibility of
Nature. Whereas the Reſemblance of Truth is
the utmoſt Limit of Poetical Liberty, which our
Author has very religiouſly obſerv'd; for he has
not only placed and connected together the moſt
Amiable Images of all thoſe Powers that are in
our Souls, but he has furniſh'd and ſquar'd his
<pb facs="tcp:49848:8"/>
Matter like a True Philoſopher; that is, he has
made both Body and Soul, Colour and Shadow of
his Poem out of the Store-houſe of his own Mind,
which gives the whole Work a Real and Natural
Beauty; when that which is borrow'd out of
Books (the Boxes of Counterfeit Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion)
ſhews Well or Ill as it has more or leſs
Likeneſs to the Natural. But our Author is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
to none but Himſelf; and by knowing
himſelf thoroughly, he has arriv'd to know much;
which appears in his admirable Variety of well-choſen
Metaphors and Similitudes that cannot be
found within the compaſs of a narrow Knowledge.
For this reaſon the Poem, on account of its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick
Worth, would be as laſting as the <hi>Iliad,</hi>
or the <hi>Aeneid,</hi> if the Language 'tis wrote in were
as Immutable as that of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now it wou'd be of great benefit to the <hi>Beau</hi>'s
of our Age to carry this Glaſs in their Pocket,
whereby they might learn to Think, rather than
Dreſs well: It would be of uſe alſo to the <hi>Wits</hi>
and <hi>Virtuoſo</hi>'s to carry this Antidote about them
againſt the Poyſon they have ſuck'd in from
<pb facs="tcp:49848:8"/>
               <hi>Lucretius</hi> or <hi>Hobbs.</hi> This would acquaint them
with ſome Principles of Religion; for in Old
Times the Poets were their Divines, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed
a kind of Spiritual Authority amongſt the
People. Verſe in thoſe Days was the Sacred
Stile, the Stile of Oracles and Laws. The Vows
and Thanks of the People were recommended to
their Gods in Songs and Hymns. Why may they
not retain this Privilege? for if Proſe ſhould
contend with Verſe, 'twould be upon unequal
Terms, and (as it were) on Foot againſt the
Wings of <hi>Pegaſus.</hi> With what Delight are
we touch'd in hearing the Stories of <hi>Hercules,
Achilles, Cyrus,</hi> and <hi>Aeneas?</hi> Becauſe in
their Characters we have Wiſdom, Honour, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
and Juſtice, ſet before our Eyes. 'Twas
<hi>Plato</hi>'s Opinion, That if a Man cou'd ſee Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
he wou'd be ſtrangely enamour'd on her
Perſon. Which is the Reaſon why <hi>Horace</hi> and
<hi>Virgil</hi> have continued ſo long in Reputation,
becauſe they have Drawn her in all the Charms
of Poetry. No Man is ſo ſenſeleſs of Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Impreſſions, as not to be wonderfully affected
with the Paſtorals of the Ancients, when under
the Stories of Wolves and Sheep, they deſcribe
<pb facs="tcp:49848:9"/>
the Miſery of People under Hard Maſters, and
their Happineſs under Good. So the bitter but
wholſome <hi>lambick</hi> was wont to make Villany
bluſh; the <hi>Satyr</hi> incited Men to laugh at Folly;
the <hi>Comedian</hi> chaſtiſed the Common Errors of
Life; and the <hi>Tragedian</hi> made Kings afraid to
be Tyrants, and Tyrants to be their own Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, as Sir <hi>Philip Sidney</hi> ſaid of
<hi>Chaucer,</hi> That he knew not which he ſhould
moſt wonder at, either that He in his dark
Time ſhould ſee ſo diſtinctly, or that We in
this clear Age ſhould go ſo ſtumblingly after him;
ſo may we marvel at and bewail the low Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Poetry now, when in our Plays ſcarce
any one Rule of Decorum is obſerved, but in
the ſpace of two Hours and an half we paſs
through all the Fits of <hi>Bethlem;</hi> in one Scene
we are all in Mirth, in the next we are ſunk
into Sadneſs; whilſt even the moſt labour'd
Parts are commonly ſtarv'd for want of Thought,
a confuſed heap of Words, and empty Sound of
Rhyme.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:49848:9"/>
This very Conſideration ſhould advance the
Eſteem of the following Poem, wherein are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
the various Movements of the Mind;
at which we are as much tranſported as with
the moſt excellent Scenes of Paſſion in <hi>Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpear,</hi>
or <hi>Fletcher:</hi> For in this, as in a
Mirrour (that will not Flatter) we ſee how
the Soul Arbitrates in the Underſtanding up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the various Reports of <hi>Senſe,</hi> and all the
Changes of Imagination: How compliant the
Will is to her Dictates, and obeys her as
a Queen does her King. At the ſame time
acknowledging a Subjection, and yet retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Majeſty. How the Paſſions more at
her Command, like a well-diſciplined Army;
from which regular Compoſure of the Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
all operating in their proper Time and
Place, there ariſes a Complacency upon the
whole Soul, that infinitely tranſcends all other
Pleaſures.</p>
            <p>What deep Philoſophy is this! to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Proceſs of God's Art in faſhioning
the Soul of Man after his own Image; by
<pb facs="tcp:49848:10"/>
remarking how one part moves another, and how
thoſe Motions are vary'd by ſeveral poſitions of
each Part, from the firſt Springs and Plummets,
to the very Hand that points out the viſible and
laſt Effects. What Eloquence and Force of
Wit to convey theſe profound Speculations in the
eaſieſt Language, expreſſed in Words ſo vulgarly
received, that they are underſtood by the meaneſt
Capacities.</p>
            <p>For the Poet takes care in every Line to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy
the Underſtandings of Mankind: He fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
Step by Step the workings of the Mind from
the firſt Strokes of <hi>Senſe,</hi> then of Fancy, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
of Judgment, into the Principles both
of Natural and Supernatural Motives: Hereby
the Soul is made intelligible, which comprehends
all things beſides; the boundleſs Tracks of Sea
and Land, and the vaſter Spaces of Heaven;
that Vital Principle of Action, which has always
been buſied in Enquiries abroad, is now made
known to its ſelf; inſomuch that we may find out
what we our ſelves are, from whence we came,
and whither we muſt go; we may perceive what
noble Gueſts thoſe are, which we lodge in our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms,
<pb facs="tcp:49848:10"/>
which are nearer to us than all other things,
and yet nothing further from our Acquaintance.</p>
            <p>But here all the Labyrinths and Windings of
the Humane Frame are laid open: 'Tis ſeen by
what Pullies and Wheels the Work is carry'd on,
as plainly as if a Window were opened into our
Breaſt: For it is the Work of God alone to create
a Mind.—The next to this is to ſhew how
its Operations are perform'd.</p>

            <head>UPON THE
Preſent Corrupted State
OF
POETRY.</head>
            <l>IN happy Ages paſt, when Juſtice reign'd,</l>
            <l>The Muſes too their Dignity maintain'd;</l>
            <l>Were only then in Shrines and Temples found,</l>
            <l>With Innocence inſtead of Lawrel crown'd;</l>
            <l>Anthems and Hallelujahs did reſound.</l>
            <l>In theſe Seraphick Tasks their hours they paſs'd,</l>
            <l>Pious as <hi>Sybil</hi>'s, and as <hi>Veſtals,</hi> chaſt</l>
            <l>They juſtly then were ſtil'd the <hi>Sacred</hi> Nine,</l>
            <l>Nor were the Heav'n-born Graces more Divine.</l>
            <l>Like them with Heav'n they did Alliance claim,</l>
            <l>And wiſeſt Kings their Votaries became:</l>
            <pb facs="tcp:49848:12"/>
            <l>Who, though by Art and Nature form'd to Reign,</l>
            <l>Their Homage paid amongſt the Muſes Train:</l>
            <l>They thought Extent of Empire leſs Renown,</l>
            <l>And priz'd their Poet's Wreath above their Prince's
Crown.</l>
            <l>Heav'ns Praiſe was then the only Theme of Verſe,</l>
            <l>Which Kings of Earth were honour'd to rehearſe.</l>
            <l>Their Songs did then fair <hi>Salem</hi>'s Temple fill,</l>
            <l>And <hi>Sion</hi> was the Muſes Sacred Hill.</l>
            <l>At length, tranſplanted from the Holy Land,</l>
            <l>To <hi>Pagan</hi> Regions paſs'd the Sacred Band;</l>
            <l>In <hi>Greece</hi> they ſettled, but with leſſen'd Grace,</l>
            <l>And chang'd their Manners as they chang'd their
Place.</l>
            <l>Here Poetry, beginning to decline,</l>
            <l>Firſt mingled Humane Praiſes with Divine.</l>
            <l>Yet ſtill they ſung alone ſome Worthy's Name,</l>
            <l>And only gave reſtoring Hero's Fame.</l>
            <l>But grew at laſt a mercenary Trade,</l>
            <l>The gift of heav'n the price of Gold was made.</l>
            <l>Brib'd Poets with Encomiums did purſue</l>
            <l>The worſt of Men, and prais'd their Vices too.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:49848:12"/>
They gave deſtroying Tyrants moſt Applauſe,</l>
            <l>Who ſhed moſt Blood, regardleſs of their Cauſe.</l>
            <l>If meerly to Deſtroy can merit Fame;</l>
            <l>Famines and Plauges the larger Trophies claim.</l>
            <l>But this and worſe, with our licentious Times</l>
            <l>Compar'd, in Poets were but Venial Crimes.</l>
            <l>That Poetry which did at firſt inſpire</l>
            <l>Coeleſtial Rapture, and Seraphick Fire,</l>
            <l>Her Talent in Hell's Service now employs,</l>
            <l>The Proſtitute and Bawd of Senſual Joys.</l>
            <l>On Miſchief's ſide engages all her Charms,</l>
            <l>Againſt Religion her Offenſive Arms:</l>
            <l>Whilſt Luſt, Extortion, Sacrilege paſs free,</l>
            <l>She points her Satyr, Virtue, againſt Thee,</l>
            <l>And turns on Heav'n its own Artillery.</l>
            <l>But Wit's fair Stream when from its genuine
Courſe</l>
            <l>Conſtrain'd, runs muddy and with leſſen'd Force.</l>
            <l>Our Poets, when Deſerters they became</l>
            <l>To Virtue's Cauſe, declin'd as much in Fame.</l>
            <l>That Curſe was on the lewd Apoſtates ſent,</l>
            <l>Who, as they grew Debauch'd, grew Impotent.</l>

Wit's ſhort-liv'd Off-ſprings in our later Times</l>

               <l>WHY did my Parents ſend me to

               <l>That I with <hi>Knowledge</hi> might
enrich my Mind?</l>
               <l>Since the <hi>Deſire to know</hi> firſt made Men Fools,</l>
               <l>And did corrupt the <hi>Root</hi> of all Mankind:</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>For when God's Hand had written in the Hearts</l>
               <l>Of Our firſt Parents all the Rules of Good;</l>
               <l>So that their Skill infus'd ſurpaſs'd all Arts</l>
               <l>That ever were before, or ſince the Flood.</l>
            </lg>

               <l>And when their Reaſon's Eye was ſharp and clear,</l>
               <l>And (as an Eagle, can behold the Sun)</l>
               <l>Could have approach'd th' Eternal Light as near</l>
