            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>We may well here take up the words of worthy Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> in his Preface before Mr. <hi>Nertons Answer to Apollonius,</hi> where having named <hi>Cartwright, Partus, Baynes,</hi> and <hi>Ames,</hi> those <hi>Chariots and Horsemen of Israel,</hi> and Leaders in the Cause of Reformation, he addes, <hi>Ab borum sive vestigiis, sive principiis si novitatis studio cessimus, jure meritò deseremur ut desertores.

                  </p>
                  <p>The Elders and Messengers of the Congregational Churches in <hi>England,</hi> in the Preface to the <hi>Result</hi> of their meeting at the <hi>Savoy,</hi> do profess a full concurrence throughout in all the substantial parts of Church-government with their Reverend Brethren the <hi>Old Puritan Non-Confermists,</hi> citing in the Margin <hi>Fox, Dearing, Greenbam, Cartwright, Fenner, Fulk, Whitaker, Reynolds, Perkins,</hi> &amp;c. Now let the Judgement of these (such of them as have left any thing written about this Question, by which we may judge of the mindes of the rest) be considered; and see if they do not abundantly confirm such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Latitude of Baptism</hi> as we plead for. What if our Congregational Brethren in <hi>England</hi> have not yet, by reason of the Infancy of their Churches, had so much occasion to look into this question (as our selves for a long time had not) nor yet so much need to trouble themselves about the full extent of Baptism, in a place where there were enow that would baptize those whom themselves left unbaptized? yet when the Lord shall incline any of those Able and Worthy Persons to set themselves to the study of this point: why should we think that they will not be willing to receive <hi>Light from,</hi> or that they will be willing easily to <hi>go against</hi> the Judgements of those <hi>Old Non-Conformists,</hi> whom they professedly concurre-with in other parts of Discipline? So much for the Discourse upon the first Objection.</p>
                  <p>In Answer to to the Second Objection, The <hi>Apologist</hi> gives this warning, <hi>Let us not for fear of Anabaptism, do worse, even defile our selves with Antichristianism.</hi> And makes this Profession, <hi>We are willing to profess that we look upon it as great a sin to Baptize all Children, as to baptize to Children.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. We should not chuse to put <hi>Anabaptism</hi> as contradistinct to <hi>Antichristianism.</hi>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:46467:3"/>
Take <hi>Antichristianism</hi> for all that which is against Christ his Mind, Rules and Kingdome, so surely <hi>Anabaptism</hi> is a part of it. Take it for the corruptions of the Papacy, how near a-kin the Doctrines and Principles of the <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Anabaptists</hi> are, is shewed in à late Preface to Mr. <hi>Shepard</hi>'s Letter. The <hi>Anabaptists</hi> are indeed ready enough to call every thing that they mislike, <hi>Antichristian</hi>; as if none were Enemies to <hi>Antichristianism</hi> so much as they. But if to oppose, obstruct, and undermine the Kingdome of our Lord Jesus Christ, be an <hi>Antichristian thing,</hi> let Scripture, Reason, and Experience speak, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their Tenents and Wayes be not highly <hi>Antichristian.</hi> Does not their <hi>cutting off</hi> so great a part of the Subjects of Christs Kingdome, as the Children of the Faithful are (<hi>Mat.</hi> 19.14.) their changing the Frame of the Covenant, whereby his vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And hath not Experience shewed <hi>Anabaptism</hi> (with its wonted concomitant Errours) to be the Vexation and Clog of Reformation ever since the beginning of it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To speak here of baptizing the children of <hi>Infidells</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> as if any did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to that, would be a strange absurdity: but if by [<hi>All Children</hi>] be meant the Children of <hi>All</hi> that are named <hi>Christians,</hi> though we think it too great a L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

we know not a better) <hi>Members of the visible Church are to be baptized: Infants of Confederate Parents are Members of the visible Church: Ergo.</hi> How readily may it be answered, that <hi>Personal and Immediate Members</hi> (or they that have personal Membership formally) <hi>are to be baptized; but not Mediate and Not-personal Members, or they that have it</hi> (not formally, but) <hi>subjectively onely.</hi> We have known an <hi>Antipoedebaptist</hi> flie to this as his Sheat-Anchor [<hi>Infants are Members; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ut how? Why, not personal Members, but Members in their parents; and so let them be baptized</hi> (mediately) <hi>in their parents, and not in their own persons.</hi>] And indeed, why should the Seal of Membership be imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately and formally applied to their own persons, if they be not in their own persons Immediate and formal (or formally) Members?</p>
                  <p>But let us search a little into this Distinction between <hi>Personal Membership</hi> as taken <hi>subjectively,</hi> and the same as taken <hi>formally,</hi> and see what there is in it, with reference to the matter in hand. For, that <hi>Children are personal and immediate Members,</hi> is asserted and proved by the Synod, but denied by our Brethren: And this Distinction is here brought to bear up that <hi>Deniall,</hi> or to tell us in what sense they deny personal Member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to Infants. It was sometimes <hi>roundly</hi> denied, that <hi>Infants are personal Members</hi>; now it is denied with a <hi>Distinction: They are personal Members</hi> (say they) <hi>subjectively, but not formally.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. If Infants be Members, they are <hi>formally</hi> so: for, <hi>Forma est per quam res est id quod est.</hi> If we say, Such an one is a Man, a Father, a Master, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we must mean that he is <hi>formally a man,</hi> or hath the form of a man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He is not a Member, that hath not the <hi>form</hi> of a Member. To say he is <hi>a Member,</hi> and to deny him the <hi>form</hi> of a Member, is to <hi>say</hi> and <hi>unsay.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is here said, that, <hi>As personal Membership is taken subjectively, so it is in Infants,</hi> i. e. <hi>their persons are Recipients of the Adjunct of Church-membership.</hi> We demand, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this does not fully yield the Cause, and give us as much as we need to the matter in hand? For, if the <hi>person</hi> of the Infant be <hi>Recipient of the Adjunct of Church-member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> then of <hi>formal</hi> Church-membership (it is not Church-membership, if it want the <hi>form</hi>) then <hi>formal</hi> (or proper) Church-membership, doth cleave to the <hi>person</hi> of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant; then the <hi>person</hi> of this Infant is <hi>formally</hi> a Church-member, or, He is a <hi>personal formal Member.</hi> He needs no more to render him a <hi>personal formal Member</hi> (or formally a personal Member) then to have the <hi>Adjunct of Church-membership</hi> upon him, or cleaving to his person. For <hi>Membership</hi> (as all such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

If therefore the <hi>person</hi> of the Infant be <hi>Recipient of the Adjunct of Church-membership,</hi> then he is a <hi>personal formal</hi> Member, or formally a personal Member, for his person hath the <hi>form</hi> of Membership upon it, or cleaving to it.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> If so it be, yet still the same Answers hold, unless it mean no more then every one grants, and so be nothing to the purpose. If the meaning onely be that Infants do not <hi>enter into Covenant</hi> by an act of their own proper persons; who ever said or thought they did? what need we labour in finding out distinctions to deny them that which no
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:46467:4"/>
body ever challenged for them? or to what purpose is that? But the Question is, <hi>Whether Infants be not personal members</hi> (or <hi>personally</hi> and <hi>formally members</hi>) <hi>although they never yet put forth an Act of covenanting in their own persons?</hi> we affirm it, because they have the forme of Membership (or the adjunct of formal membership) cleaving to their own persons by Divine Institution. And so we say they are personally, and formally Members, though they have not yet acted any thing in their own proper persons. You seem to deny it, and bring a distinction to clear your meaning: the <hi>former Branch</hi> of which distinction, as your selves explain it, grants the thing that we plead for; the <hi>latter Branch,</hi> as you also explain it, denies no more then we deny, viz. <hi>That they enter by their own proper per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal Act.</hi> But the mistake lies in making this [viz. <hi>Entring by ones own proper Act</hi>] to be formally personal membership: whereas that is formally personal membership, that doth formally and properly constitute the person a member; and so, [<hi>Being within the Covenant</hi>] doth the Infants in question, though they never yet acted in their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. The distinction should rather stand thus; As personal membership is taken properly and formally, so it agrees to Infants; <hi>i. e.</hi> their persons are Recipients of the adjunct of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per formal Church-membership, but as personal membership is taken improperly (and very improperly indeed) <hi>i. e.</hi> for the membership of such as have by themselves or by their own personal profession entred into Covenant, so Infants are not capable of personal membership. Thus it might be granted. But why should we use <hi>personal membership</hi> in so improper a sence, or insist on a sence that toucheth not the cause in question? The sum is, that if by [<hi>Personal membership taken formally</hi>] be meant onely, entring by their own proper personal act, then the distinction is needless and not <hi>ad Rem.</hi> But if it be meant so as to deny what we affirm, then it is overthrown by your selves in the <hi>former Branch.</hi> Grant them to be personal Members <hi>subjectively,</hi> you therein grant them to be so <hi>formally:</hi> deny them personal membership <hi>formally,</hi> you deny it <hi>subjectively.</hi> These do <hi>mutuò so ponere &amp; tollere,</hi> being used in any sence that is proper and pertinent to the present Dispute. But consider whether it would sound rationally to say, that <hi>Paul</hi> was not <hi>formally</hi> a <hi>personal Roman</hi> (or not formally a <hi>Roman free-man</hi> in his own person) because he did not buy his freedome with his own money; or that a Childe who hath an Inheritance left him, is not <hi>formally</hi> a personal owner thereof, because himself did not purchase it: or, that Infants are personal Subjects in such a Kingdome, Members of such a Family, <hi>subjectively</hi> onely, not <hi>formally,</hi> because they did not become such by their own previous personal act. These and such like shew how improper and incongruous it is, to make ones own personal act to be that which constitutes the formality of personal membership.</p>
                  <p>Preface. <hi>It's strange to us to conceive, that they should have this personal formal member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and yet that they should not be Subjects capable of formal personal Censures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> They are <hi>capable</hi> in regard of their <hi>Relation</hi> and <hi>state</hi> in the Church, though not in regard of natural Capacity, nor in regard of demerit; for an Infant cannot Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastically deserve publick Censure. It is not strange to conceive Infants to be Subjects of such a Prince, though at present uncapable of civil Tryals and punishments. It suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices that Infant-members are in a <hi>state</hi> of subjection to Church Discipline, and ingaged thereto for afterward, though at present naturally uncapable of the exercise thereof. The new born Infant is not capable of Domestical Discipline (either <hi>Rod</hi> or <hi>Rebuke</hi>) but that hinders not his being a formal personal Member of the Family.</p>
                  <p>Preface. <hi>We neither do, nor ever did deny, that, the persons of Infants of believing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate Parents, are brought under the Covenant, onely we conceive that their membership is conjunct with, and dependent upon the Membership and Covenant of their Parents, so as to live and dye therewith—Hence when the Parents are Excommunicated, the membership of the Infant-childe is cut off<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because Excommunication puts an end to the outward Covenant (which Death it self doth not do) and if the Root be destroyed, the Branches cannot live.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> That the childes membership depends upon the membership of the Parent, as the Instrumental Cause or Condition of the childes <hi>first Entrance</hi> into the Church, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a Member, we readily grant (because Divine Institution admitteth onely the Children of Members to be Members) and so much Mr. <hi>Cottons</hi> words here all<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>dged in the <hi>Preface</hi> do truly teach. But that the childes membership is so <hi>wrapt up</hi> in the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership of the Parent, as to live and dye therewith, as if it had no proper and distinct
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:46467:4"/>
membership of its own, is surely a deep mistake, and will (if followed) overthrow that <hi>subjective personal membership</hi> before granted unto Infants, and that which is here also owned, viz. <hi>that their persons are brought under the Covenant</hi>: If the persons of the Infants be brought <hi>under</hi> the Covenant, then their persons are <hi>within</hi> the Covenant, or their persons are <hi>Confederate,</hi> then not onely the person of the Parent, but the person of the childe hath the formality of membership upon it. And as the person of the childe in regard of its natural being, though for the first existence thereof it depended under God upon the Parent, yet when once it is born into the World, it is not so <hi>conjunct with, and dependent upon</hi> the person of the Parent, as <hi>to live and dye therewith</hi>; so why should the membership of the childe be <hi>thus dependent?</hi> seeing <hi>the Book</hi> (to which this Preface is prefixed) affirmeth, <hi>p</hi> 37. that the <hi>Parent is a procreant Cause, as of the Childe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> natural Being by his generating him, so also of his Church-membership by his confederating for him, and this by Gods Institution.</hi> And seeing the person of the Childe hath a membership of its own affixed to it (as the foresaid grants import) and that <hi>from God (from Gods Covenant and Institution)</hi> as well as the person of the Parent; why should we say, that the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership of the Childe doth after this, <hi>depend upon</hi> the Membership or Covenant of the Parent, and not rather upon Gods Covenant and Institution, so as to live and dye accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Order and appointment thereof, and not otherwise? hence the <hi>Membership</hi> wherewith the person of the Childe is clothed by Gods Institution, dyes not till either the person of the Childe dye, or till by some Institution and Appointment of God he be cut off from his Membership for his own sin. Neither must it be yelded, that the <hi>Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of the Parent,</hi> doth properly and formally cut off the Infant-childe that was born before such Excommunication. We say, <hi>properly</hi> and <hi>formally,</hi> for Consequentially and Eventually it may bring the Childe to be cut off also; as in case the Parent <hi>desperately</hi> go away from the Church among <hi>Hereticks</hi> and <hi>Infidels,</hi> and bring up the Childe <hi>to serve other Gods</hi>: But so it may be with a wife carried away by such an Husband, yet that does not hinder her from having a personal, distinct, proper and immediate Membership, nor make his cutting off to be hers also. But suppose a Parent and Children that live and continue among us; the Parent having a company of Children, all in their minority, is for his wickedness cast out, and continuing impenitent, dyes in that estate: to say that all these Children (who were Born and Baptized in the Church) are <hi>cut off</hi> from Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership hereby, is a strange Assertion.</p>
                  <p>For 1. This would make an Infant-childe to be a subject of Excommunication, which was before (and in regard of natural capacity and demerit, rightly) denied.</p>

Now put but this into the Objection here mentioned [<hi>Without desert of Church-censure</hi>] which is manifestly the case of the persons described in the Synods fifth Proposition; and then all the discourse in Answer to this Objection (wherein not a little confidence and spirit is expressed) falls to the ground as not reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the case in hand; though besides there are sundry mistakes in it as may after appear. For, suppose it should be granted, that in Churches where Discipline is not in use, and in a case notorious, wherein a person does apparently <hi>lose</hi> the Essentials of Christianity (as by turning <hi>Turk</hi> or the like) a man may be <hi>cut off</hi> from Membership by his own <hi>Apostacie</hi> and <hi>Wickedness,</hi> though the Church did not (through her sinful neglect) formally censure him. Yet this on the other hand is also a sure and clear Truth, that no act of a mans <hi>own,</hi> will or can cut him off from Membership, but that which <hi>deserves</hi> a cutting off by censure, and for which the Church should cut him off by censure if she did her Duty. This is plain, because when a man is <hi>once</hi> in the Church, he cannot be outed, till <hi>God out him</hi>: God does not <hi>out him,</hi> till some Rule or appointment of his in his word does <hi>out him</hi>: but there is no Rule that appoints any man to be put out of the visible Church, or made as <hi>an Heathen</hi> and <hi>Publican,</hi> but for and upon such wickedness of his as is <hi>Censurable</hi> by the Church; and in that case the Rule does appoint and injoyn the Church to Censure him, or to <hi>put him away from among them</hi> by censure, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5, 13. When some Divines do so speak as if persons might be <hi>broken off</hi> from the Church without a <hi>formal</hi> Censure in some extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary cases; the meaning is, not that a man doth by his <hi>own wickedness,</hi> be it never so notorious, immediately so become <hi>Felo de se,</hi> or <hi>Vn-member</hi> himself, as that the Church hath nothing to do with him to Censure him; yes, she may and ought to censure him for his wickedness and Apostacy; and so if a Church-member turn <hi>Turk</hi> or <hi>Papist,</hi> the Church to which he belongs ought to lay him under Censure for it. And for such a one to be a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber till Censured, <hi>i. e.</hi> A <hi>rotten Member</hi> fit to be <hi>cut off,</hi> is no contradiction nor absurdity.

                  <p>
                     <hi>And we humbly conceiue that thus much is held forth by these Scriptures,</hi> Heb. 10.25. 1 Joh. 2.19. Jud. 19.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> That the sin of those who forsake Church-assemblies, separate themselves from them, wander into wayes of Heresie and Apostacy, is grievous (and consequently calleth for Church-admonition, and incorrigibleness therein for excommunication) this may be gathered from those Scriptures; but to gather thence, that such <hi>forsakers, separatisie</hi> and <hi>wanderers,</hi> do thereby become <hi>Non-members,</hi> so as that the Church <hi>should not, need not,</hi> or <hi>may not</hi> follow them with any Censure, is a strange Collection; and would (if granted) at once overthrow all Discipline. For what is more easie then for an offender to forsake the Assembly, to separate himself, &amp;c? and then the Church shall have no more to do with him; so the process of Discipline appointed in <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. should never take place. What though there be no mention of <hi>Church-censure</hi> in the Texts alledged? must we binde the Holy-Ghost to mention all Truths and Rules together in one Text or Context? what the <hi>sin</hi> of such persons is, those Texts shew; but what <hi>Discipline</hi> is to be used to Church-sinners, this is held forth in other Scriptures. If the Apostle in 1 <hi>Iob.</hi> 2.19. have reference to <hi>Ebion</hi> and <hi>Cerinthus,</hi> and such like Hereticks (as is commonly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: <hi>vid. Magdeburg. Centur.</hi> 1. <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 485) surely he was not without care to have due Testimony by Church-censure born against them, yea when as he does so strictly injoyn all Christians absolutely to avoid them, 2 <hi>Iohn ver.</hi> 7—10. doth not that import an injunction to the Churches unto which they did belong, to Excommunicate them, if they had not already done it? as when <hi>Paul</hi> forbids them to <hi>eat with such an one,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. he means it, as a consequent upon (and so implying an injunction of) Church-censure. <hi>vid.

                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Should <hi>We</hi> thus Reason, you would call for <hi>Gospel-Rules</hi> and Proofs; which we may with more reason do in this case, because proper Excommunication is plainly and expresly ordained under the Gospel: Concerning the use of which, there is not so much clearness in the Old Testament. 2. The particular extraordinary Revelation of Gods minde concerning <hi>Esau,</hi> together with his being denied the <hi>Patriarchal Blessing,</hi> of which the Apostle saith [<hi>He was rejected</hi>] Heb. 12.17. may well be looked at as equivalent to an ordinary Excommunication under the Gospel. 3. The Posterity of <hi>Abraham</hi> by <hi>Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turah,</hi> did in process of time lose their Membership, by losing the <hi>Essentials</hi> of true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and to expect personal Excommunication, when a whole People <hi>falls away</hi> to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, and so becomes <hi>Lo-am<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>,</hi> is a vain thing. But it is a great mistake to think that the particular persons mentioned in <hi>Genes.</hi> 25.2, 3, 4. yea or their <hi>next</hi> generations did <hi>cease</hi> to be Members of the visible Church. They were <hi>Providentially</hi> removed out of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which was reserved for <hi>Israel,</hi> and were permitted <hi>by degrees</hi> to lose Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which was by Promise to be continued and established in the line of <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> so as that in the time of <hi>Moses</hi> (the Nations being by that time generally fallen to Idolatry) Religion and Worship was so <hi>fixed</hi> in the Nation and Church of <hi>Israel,</hi> as that all that would serve God aright must become <hi>Proselytes</hi> to it, which before that time was not necessary. But Religion and Salvation, and consequently Church-membership, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Domestick</hi> way of administration then used, did for a considerable time continue among the Children of <hi>Abraham</hi> by <hi>Keturah,</hi> as the story of <hi>Iob</hi> intimates; he and his Friends being justly conceived to have been <hi>partly</hi> of that Stock. And concerning <hi>Iethro,</hi> who was of <hi>Midian,</hi> and so of <hi>Keturah,</hi> see <hi>Rivet</hi> on <hi>Exod.</hi> 2. and on <hi>Exod.</hi> 18.12.</p>

                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Suppose you should prove that a Church-member may [<hi>Possibly</hi>] become no Member without a Censure; yet we are still utterly to seek of Proof that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e <hi>Children in question</hi> do so. 2. How can a Separation be properly pertinacious and incurable, or appear so to be, till the means of Church discipline have been used? 3. <hi>Ames</hi> his meaning may be, that such are not to be <hi>accounted lawful</hi> and <hi>approved</hi> Members, as in the close of that Chapter (<hi>De Consc. Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Cap.</hi> 12.) he saith, <hi>

                        </gap>smatical</hi> Church is not to be <hi>accounted for a lawful and approved Church.</hi> 4. We shall not deny but that some good Divines do seem to hold, that in some cases of notorious Wickedness, and Apostacy, and so in case of absolute and universal Schism (of which <hi>Ames</hi> there spe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ks) especially in places and Churches where Discipline is not used; men may be looked at as Non-members, though the Church did neglect to pass a formal Censure: wherein we shall not trouble our selves with being their Opponents. It sufficeth us, that in Churches regularly using Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline, there is no ordinary way whereby offenders lose Church-membership, but by Excommunication: And that none can lose it while they live, that are not guilty of such evil as is <hi>censureable,</hi> or is <hi>matter</hi> of Excommunication; which the persons in question are not.</p>
                  <p>Another Testimony here alledged, is from Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> in his <hi>Way of the Churches,</hi> p. 9. where he saith, that <hi>Many in Churches have cut themselves off.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Had the whole sentence been set down, every Reader would have seen the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinency of the Allegation, as to the Persons and Case in question. Mr. <hi>Cot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ut themselves off from the Covenant by their noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious wickedness and profaneness.</hi> And withall in the same place he addes, that <hi>Arelapsed Church, with all the Members of it, are bound to renew their Covenant</hi> in order to Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: which shews, that they were not wholly cut off before, though their Membership was but by being born in the Church, and baptized, for of that he there speaks. We doubt not, but among the <hi>Members</hi> of such <hi>Relapsed Churches</hi> might be found many much more degenerate; then those described in the <hi>Synods Fifth Preposition</hi>; much less therefore are those Discovenanted, but being in Covenant, are bound to renew it in order to full Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>
                  <p>The next Testimony here produced, is from those words in the <hi>Discourse of Church-Covenant,</hi> pag. 17. viz. <hi>That if men had not promised, and also performed in some measure of truth, the duties of Faith and Obedience unto God, they had not taken hold of the Covenant, but had Discovenanted themselves, notwithstanding all the Promises of God unto their Fathers and others. Thus though God promised</hi> Abraham <hi>to be a God to him, and to his seed in their generations,</hi> Genes. 17 7. <hi>yet the</hi> Ishmaelites <hi>and</hi> Edomites <hi>descending from</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, <hi>were Discovenanted by not promising nor performing those duties of Faith and Obedience which God required on the peoples part.

                     <hi>Excommunication</hi> (i. e. the utmost Censure, so called) doth not properly or nextly debarre or exclude from full Communion, but it cutteth off from Membership (rendreth a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son as an Heathen and Publican, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.17.) and so from that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion that belongeth to a Member <hi>as such.</hi> When a person that hath stood for some time <hi>Admonished,</hi> is afterward, for his contumacy, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, it is not <hi>Excommunication</hi> that doth <hi>immediately</hi> and <hi>properly</hi> put him out of full Communion, for that was done by <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition</hi>; whereby, being Ecclesiastically unclean, he was justly suspend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from eating of the Holy things: but Excommunication cuts him off from Membership, which Admonition did not.

                  <p>As for that term of [<hi>Formal</hi>] Excommunication, we know not that we are limited to this or that precise <hi>form of words,</hi> in Excommunicating one sort or other; but the <hi>formal nature of the thing</hi> (viz. a putting of one <hi>out</hi> of the Church that was before <hi>in</hi> it) This well agrees to the persons in question.</p>

                  <p>Reason 1. <hi>The Synod did acknowledge, That there ought to be true saving Faith in the Parent, according to the judgement of rational Charity, or else the Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> The regular receiver of the Truth, is one that <hi>divides the Hoof,</hi> as well as <hi>chews the Cud</hi>; one that doth not take all in a Lump, but <hi>distinguishes,</hi> and rightly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides between things that differ. We are to distinguish here,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Between <hi>Faith</hi> in the <hi>being</hi> or first <hi>beginning</hi> of it, whereby one is, or is reputed to be in the <hi>state</hi> of a Believer, the Charitable, judgement whereof runs upon a great Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; and Faith in the <hi>special exercise</hi> of it, whereby one is fit for that <hi>special Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> with, and <hi>active Fruition</hi> of Christ, which is the scope of the <hi>Lords Supper:</hi> unto the visible discovery whereof, more lively <hi>Fruits,</hi> and more <hi>experienced Operations</hi> of Faith are requisite.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Distinguish between the <hi>internal Grace it self,</hi> which is required of them that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of Sacraments in the <hi>sight of God</hi>; and those <hi>external signs</hi> of that Grace which <hi>the Church</hi> is to proceed upon in her <hi>Admission</hi> of persons unto Sacraments. These two Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions being attended, and rightly applied, will help to clear both the Truth it self in this matter from mistakes, and the Proceedings of the Synod from those uncomfortable Reflexions that are here cast upon them.</p>
                  <p>The former of these Distinctions, and the application thereof to the matter in hand, we have in Dr. <hi>Ames</hi>; <note n="(a)" place="margin">

An <hi>initial Faith</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titleth to the Seal of <hi>Initiation,</hi> but a <hi>grown Faith</hi> (i. e. a Faith of some growth, though yet farre short of Perfection, and needing to grow still) a Faith growing up unto some sensible and lively <hi>exercise,</hi> is requisite unto the Sacrament of growth and fruition.

                  <p>The latter Distinction also is obvious and necessary. <hi>Who ought to come,</hi> and, <hi>Who ought to be admitted,</hi> are two distinct Questions, say <hi>Vrsin,</hi> and <note n="(c)" place="margin">

But Baptism is our entrance, and the lowest degree of Grace will serve here in the judgement of Charity.</hi>

                  <p>Worthy <hi>Hildersam</hi> on Psal. 51.5. pag. 257. saith, <hi>The Infants of the Faithful are said to be Holy, not because they are without sin, but because (in the judgement of the Church) they are to be esteemed not Infidels as other Children of</hi> Pagans, <hi>but Christians and Believers, and holy and true Members of the Church of God. And Hence</hi> 1. <hi>So soon as they are born they have title to the Seal of Gods Covenant, and the Church may not deny it unto then.—And why may not the Church deny Baptism to any childe of a believing Parent? surely because the Church is bound to esteem every such childe not an Infidel, but rather a Believer and a true Christian.</hi> 2. <hi>When they dye we are in Christian Charity to judge that they dye in Gods favour, and in the state of Salvation.</hi> And all this because of the Covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. as he there addes. Yet the same <hi>Hildersam</hi> would not admit such as these (who were born and grew up in the visible Church) to the Lords Table, without a strict Examination not onely of their Knowledge and Lives, but of <hi>their Spiritual Estate.</hi> Doct. of Lords Supper, pag. 8—14.</p>
                  <p>All which we produce, not as if the Testimony and concurrence of <hi>Authors</hi> were the <hi>Basis</hi> that our judgement in this matter stands upon, but because this <hi>Preface</hi> doth, both in this place and in other parts of it, insinuate to the <hi>Reader</hi> as if <hi>Authority</hi> of Writers were for the <hi>Dissenters,</hi> and against the Doctrine of the <hi>Synod,</hi> which is farre from being so: the contrary being abundantly, and undeniably evident.

Studiousness of Reformation; yea, of those from whom our <hi>Congregational Leaders</hi> have professed to receive their <hi>Principles,</hi> as was abovesaid. And we confess our selves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious to so much of our own weakness, that unless we have very clear Light, and undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Argument constraining us, we are slow and fearful to go <hi>alone,</hi> or to go contrary to the concurrent Judgement of our best <hi>Divines,</hi> who (if we may use our <hi>Brethrens</hi> phrase) have been <hi>Stars of the first Magnitude, incomparable Champions for the Truth,</hi> and have been raised up by Christ to light the Path of Reformation in these later Ages.</p>
                  <p>Now as for what is here alledged by our Brethren as favouring their Cause; To say, <hi>That the</hi> Catechumeni <hi>were not (in the Primitive times) to be baptized, before they were fit for the Lords Supper.</hi> Consider how it can consist with the above mentioned practice of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> in not so much as <hi>teaching</hi> the <hi>Catechumeni</hi> any thing about the Lords Supper, till after they were baptized. Indeed, as the Darkness and Corruption of the times in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased, Baptism was not onely deferred till <hi>Easter</hi> (as is here said) but till death, which is justly taxed as an abuse by <hi>Cartwright</hi> in his <hi>Catechism,</hi> pag. 182. and we suppose will not be approved by any. The <hi>Arausiacan Councils,</hi> 19 <hi>Canon</hi>; doth not concern the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Baptism, as it is set down by the <hi>Magdeburg Centurists</hi> (<hi>Cent.</hi> 5. pag. 907.) But however it be, it is of small moment.

We finde also that in <hi>Austin's</hi> time, and some ages after, they gave the Lords Supper to Infants, yet then we suppose they would give both Sacraments to some Infants, whose Parents they debarred from the Lords Supper. But if it was indeed <hi>a grievous errour</hi> to administer the Lords Supper to Infants (as is here right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly said by our Brethren) how then is <hi>Baptism of no greater Latitude, as to the Subject there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, then the Lords Supper?</hi> Yea, let any man shew a reason why Baptism should be regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly extendible to Infants, and not the Lords Supper, if the <hi>very sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>As for that of <hi>Iuel,</hi> That <hi>Baptism is as much to be reverenced, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ.</hi> And that which follows, <hi>That former Ages have been farre from looking upon the Lords Supper as being of a more sacred nature then the other Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Baptism.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> To assert that Scripture Rules make the Subject of Baptism <hi>larger</hi> then the Subject of the Lords Supper, this doth not detract from the <hi>Reverence</hi> of Baptism, nor render it an Ordinance of a <hi>less sacred</hi> nature, as is here insinuated. The <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Prayer</hi> are Ordinances of a very sacred nature, and to be highly reverenced, and yet many may be admitted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, that may not be admitted unto Sacraments. The <hi>Sacredness</hi> of every Ordinance, lies in the holy and religious application of it to its proper ends and uses by Divine Institution: But the proper ends and uses of one Ordinance may, by Divine Institution, be such as may admit more to partake of it then of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and yet the <hi>sacred nature</hi> thereof be no whit impaired <note n="(b)" place="margin">Consider whether it be not a greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting from the sacredness of Baptism, when we make but a light matter of that Membership and Covenant that was sealed therein. If men have been once admitted to the Lords Supper, they count their Membership stands firm &amp; good (through all decayes and degeneracies) until excommunicate. But the Solemn Covenant &amp; Engagement between God and the Baptized, that was ratified in holy Baptism, wears away, and is a kinde of forgotten thing by that time they become adult. To be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult in admissions unto Baptism, and yet easie in letting go the benefit of Baptism (or the Member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship thereby sealed) and to alledge the Sacredness of the Ordinance for the former, and forget in the latter, seem not well to cohere.</note>.</p>
                  <p>But the Preface addes: <hi>Indeed of late there have been those who have made Baptism of a farre larger ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent then the Lords Supper: This hath been one Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical Difference between Congregational-men and Presbyterians.</hi>

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Whether it have been onely a <hi>late</hi> or <hi>novell</hi> Notion, to make Baptism larger then the Lords Supper, let the <hi>Reader</hi> judge, when he hath considered the <hi>Testimonies</hi> before alledged, with many more that might have been added thereunto: But we are so farre from looking upon <hi>a different Latitude</hi> of these <hi>two Sacraments</hi> to be a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Principle, or <hi>Anti-Congregational</hi> as that we perswade our selves, the <hi>Congregational way</hi> cannot long stand without it. For, if we deny this, and administer Baptism to none
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:46467:16"/>
but those whose Parents do partake of the Lords Supper, and so are in full Communion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then we must either make <hi>full Communion</hi> very <hi>large,</hi> which in the Congregational-way, where <hi>Brethren</hi> have so great an interest in Church-transactions, will soon ruine all: or else make <hi>Baptism,</hi> and consequently the <hi>Compass</hi> of the visible Church so <hi>strait,</hi> as will never stand before Rational and Scriptural men; yea, we shall put multitudes out of the visible Church, that are in a visible state of Salvation, which is absurd: for to deny persons <hi>Baptism</hi> for themselves or Children, is to deny them to be <hi>within the Compass</hi> of the <hi>visible Church,</hi> seeing Baptism ought to run parallel with Church-Membership. But how shall we deny them a room in the visible Church, who were once <hi>in,</hi> and are by no Rule to be put <hi>out,</hi> nay whom God (as we may charitably hope) taketh <hi>into Heaven</hi> when they die, and that as a <hi>fruit</hi> of his Covenant-grace? which is the case of many of our Children who are not yet come up to full Communion. But so much for the <hi>second Reason</hi> of our Brethrens Dissent. The <hi>third</hi> follows.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The Parents of the Children in question, are not Members of any Instituted Church, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gospel rules <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> because they were never under any explicite and personal Covenant.</hi> Which is former proved; <hi>Because if they be Members, then they would be a true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Church though all their Parents were dead, and then they must have power of Voting in Church-affairs, which is denied to them by the Synod.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> .1. It seems, by what is here said, that our Children <hi>were never under any expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite and personal Covenant,</hi> and that all that never were so, are <hi>not members of any Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Church according to Gospel-rules.</hi> If this be so, then what is become of <hi>Childrens Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership,</hi> which the <hi>Apologist</hi> before, in Answer to <hi>Objection Second,</hi> took it as an injury to be charged with the denial of? It seems <hi>our Children</hi> neither <hi>are</hi> nor ever <hi>were</hi> Members of any instituted Church according to Gospel-rules, because they <hi>were never under any explicite and personal Covenant.</hi> Is it come to this, that Children are not Members of any <hi>Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted</hi> Church? How then? are they Members of the <hi>Catholick visible</hi> Church? or are they no Members at all? the former our <hi>Brethren</hi> fancy not, as it seems by their <hi>Anti-Synodalia,</hi> pag. 19. the latter then remains to be the conclusion. Neither will it salve it to say, they were Members in <hi>Minority,</hi> though they be not Members <hi>now</hi> when they are <hi>Adult</hi>; for if all those that were never under any explicite and personal Covenant, be no Members of any Instituted Church, and if Children were never under any explicite and personal Covenant (both which are here said) then no Children (no not while in Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority) are Members of any Instituted Church. For our parts we doubt not to affirm with Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> in his Chapter <hi>de Ecclesia institutâ,</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. The Consequent of our assertion here urged as absurd, viz. [<hi>That then, in ease all the pro-parents were dead, this second Generation would be a true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Church of Christ without any further act or covenanting</hi>] is no absurdity but a manifest Truth, i. e. taking that Phrase [<hi>Further act, or covenanting</hi>] to be meant of a <hi>particular formal act of Explicite Verbal covenanting.</hi> For otherwise, there is a further act, yea an act of (implicite) covenanting in their constant and publick profession of the Religion of their Fathers. But we say this second Generation, continuing (to use Mr. <hi>Cottons</hi> Phrase in <hi>Grounds of Baptism,</hi> pag. 106.) in a visible profession of the Covenant, Faith, and Religion of their Fathers, are <hi>a true Church</hi> of Christ, though they have not yet made any explicite per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal expression of their engagement, as their Fathers did<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Even as the <hi>Israelites</hi> that were numbred in the <hi>Plains</hi> of <hi>Moab</hi> were a true Church, and under the Covenant of God made with them in <hi>Horeb,</hi> though their Parents with whom it was first made in <hi>Horeb,</hi> were all dead, and that before the solemn renewing of the Covenant with them in the plains of <hi>Moab, Deut.</hi> 29. see <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.2, 3. with <hi>Numb.</hi> 26.63, 64, 65. and so

Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> roundly and expresly affirms this which is here by our Brethren denied, <hi>Survey. Part.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 48.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As for our <hi>denial of the liberty of Voting in Church-affairs to the persons in question, till they be fitted for, and admitted to the Lords Supper,</hi> it stands good and rational without any prejudice to their being a true Church in the case supposed. For there is no difficulty in it, to conceive that the case of <hi>a true Church</hi> may be such (by degeneracy, or loss of their best Members, &amp;c.) as that they may be at present unfit to <hi>put forth</hi> or <hi>exercise</hi> a power of acting in Church-affairs (though it be <hi>radically</hi> in them) till by the use of needful means they, or a select qualified number among them, be brought up unto a better and fitter capacity for it. And examples hereof are not farre to seek: let that way of reforming corrupt and degenerate Churches be attended which is partly suggested in Mr. <hi>Allin's,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Shepard's Preface, before their Defence of the Nine Positions</hi> (which Preface <hi>Beverly</hi> saith is <hi>Instar omnium</hi>) Pag. 10, 18, 19, 20. <hi>viz.</hi>

Have not the late times had experience of many Congregations unto which it was fain to be a publick care to sent Ministers, and they to preach to them many years before they found a number fit for full Communion and management of Church-affairs? and yet they retained the being of true Churches, and Church-members all this while. See also Mr. <hi>Shepards</hi> late-printed Letter about the <hi>Church-membership of Children,</hi> pag. 18. We might also ask whether such a member of reasoning as is here used would prove Women to be no Members of an Instituted Church? Because if all the Men were dead, they could not then be a Church, nor Vote in Church-affairs, chuse Officers, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But that which is said may suffice: onely let us adde, that as the case that is supposed, viz. of <hi>all the Parents</hi> (or all that were in full Communion) <hi>being dead, at once,</hi> is rarely, if ever heard of; so also the case we added, viz. <hi>for the whole body to be fallen into an unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for full Communion,</hi> by corruption and degeneracy, would be (we may hope) as rare, if <hi>Discipline</hi> and other Ordinances be kept up, in their use and vigour. God will so bless his own Ordinances, if duely attended, as that a considerable number shall from time to time have such Grace given them as to be fit for full Communion, and to carry on all the things of his House with competent Strength, Beauty, and Edification.</p>
                  <p>The fourth <hi>Reason</hi> of our Brethrens Dissent, is this: <hi>It is not meer Membership (as the Synod speaks) but qualified Membership that gives right unto Baptism: for</hi> John<hi>'s Baptism might not be applied unto the standing Members of the visible Church, till they were qualified with Repentance.

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> This term or distinction of [<hi>Meer Membership</hi>] is here, as also in the Book to which this Preface is prefixed, much exagitated, and harshly censured: but let the plain meaning of the Synod therein be attended, and there will appear no cause for such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agitation. When the Synod said, that <hi>persons are not therefore to be admitted to full Communion meerly because they are and continue Members</hi>; and that <hi>Meer Membership</hi> (or <hi>Membership alone</hi>) doth not suffice to render men Subjects of the Lords Supper, <hi>Propos.</hi> 4. p. 17, 18. the meaning is, That full Communion doth not belong to a Member <hi>as such,</hi> or to a person <hi>meerly because</hi> he is <hi>a Member,</hi> for then it would belong to <hi>all</hi> Members, which it doth not. A person may be a Member (or in memberly Relation) and yet not bein full Communion. Now to say that <hi>meer Membership</hi> (in this sense) <hi>the Scripture acknowledgeth not,</hi> is as if
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:46467:17"/>
one should say, that the Scripture acknowledgeth not <hi>Logical Distinctions</hi> between things in their Abstract and general Nature, and the same things as clothed with various Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncts and Accessions; which to say, were strangely to forget our selves. But when it is hence inferred and put upon us, That we <hi>set up</hi> a meer Membership, and a <hi>sort</hi> of <hi>meer Members</hi> in the Church; this is an unnecessary Reflexion. As, if we should say that Riches do not belong to men <hi>meerly as men,</hi> or meerly because they are men; would it be a good inference to say, that we set up a sort of <hi>meer men</hi> (or a <hi>meer Humanity</hi> existing alone) or that we distinguish men into <hi>Meer</hi> men, and <hi>Rich</hi> men? There is no individual man in the world that is a <hi>meer</hi> man, i. e. that hath a naked Humanity without Adjuncts; yet <hi>Logick distinguisheth</hi> between <hi>Humanity</hi> and its <hi>Adjuncts,</hi> and between what belongeth to a man <hi>as</hi> such, and what accreweth to him <hi>other wayes,.</hi> So in the Church; Member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, or memberly Relation, is not existent in particular persons, without <hi>some Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> flowing from it, nor yet without <hi>some Qualifications</hi> (unto Charity) under it, more or less, at least ordinarily; though it may, and often does exist without those <hi>special</hi> and <hi>peculiar qualifications</hi> that fit men for the Lords Table. But surely we may well <hi>distinguish,</hi> especially between the memberly <hi>Rel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>tion</hi> and those <hi>special superadded Qualifications,</hi> and between what belongs to persons in the one respect and in the other. For some Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges in the Church belong to persons <hi>by virtue of their memberly Relation,</hi> or <hi>meerly because they are Members</hi>; they belong to a Member <hi>as such:</hi> so does Baptism, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. the Benefit of Church-watch and Discipline (<hi>viz.</hi> according to <hi>Natural</hi> capacity in regard of age, there is no other <hi>Moral</hi> capacity but that of Membership requisite to a Subject thereof) <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.12 and a share in the common Legacies of the Covenant, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.1, 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9.4. <hi>Acts</hi> 3.25, 26. Meer Membership, or Membership alone, gives right to these things. But there be other Priviledges in the Church that do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to <hi>Members as such</hi> (or to persons meerly because they are Members) but to <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers as clothed with such and such special qualifications.</hi> So the <hi>Passover</hi> and other <hi>holy things</hi> of old, and so the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> now, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28.</p>
                  <p>Now thus to <hi>distinguish,</hi> does not distribute Members into <hi>meer</hi> Members and <hi>others,</hi> but it distributes <hi>Priviledges</hi> unto their <hi>proper</hi> Subjects, and states the <hi>immediate Right</hi> unto each sort of Priviledges upon its <hi>proper Basis.</hi> If we say that <hi>Government</hi> of a <hi>Family</hi> does not belong to persons <hi>meerly</hi> because they are Members of the Family; do we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by set up a sort of <hi>meer Members</hi> thereof, that have no Family-benefit, but onely a Titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary Relation to it, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> Indeed such a saying would impor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, that in a Family there are some that <hi>are Governours,</hi> and some that are <hi>not Governours</hi> of it; as also that one may be a Member of a Family, and yet have no hand in the Government thereof. So the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in hand implies, That in the Church <hi>some</hi> are in full Communion, and <hi>some</hi> are not; and that one may <hi>be in Memberly Relation,</hi> and yet <hi>not be in full Communion:</hi> and surely the truth of this cannot be doubted of. If Children in minority be Members (as our Brethren acknowledge them to be) then there are some Members that are not in (nor yet fit for) full Communion. And for the <hi>Adult,</hi> when a man is by <hi>Admonition</hi> debarred from the Lords Table, and yet not Excommunicated; does he not continue a Member (yea, a <hi>personal Member</hi> in our <hi>Brethrens</hi> account) and yet is not in full Communion? This demonstrates that <hi>Membership</hi> and <hi>full Communion</hi> are distinct and separable things. It is clear enough, that our Non excommunicable Children do continue Members of the Church; yet many of them are not in full Communi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> will our Brethren say that they are fit for it. So then, neither the <hi>Logical distinction</hi> between what belongs to persons simply <hi>as</hi> Members (or by their meer Membership) and what belongs to them <hi>as</hi> further endued with such and such special qualifications; nor yet the <hi>Assertion</hi> flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from it, viz.

The sum is; The persons in question have by virtue of their memberly Relation (or meerly by their Membership) a proper right unto the Priviledges that are desired for them; yet withall, they have some qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and some Communion (and so are not <hi>meer Members</hi> in contradistinction here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto) though they have not yet such full qualifications as to come into full Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>

And hence by the way, let it be minded that the <hi>Synod</hi> in their <hi>fifth Proposition</hi> have comprized both the <hi>Right</hi> to Baptism, and the <hi>manner of administration:</hi> the distinstion between which two, was often-over mentioned in the <hi>Synod</hi>; though they put both together in the <hi>Proposition</hi> for better concurrence sake, and that they might at once familiarly set down what is to be attended in such a case. The [<hi>Right</hi>] stands upon [<hi>Membership</hi>] where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the parent, and so the Childe is regularly within the visible Church; so as no more qualification in the Parent is simply necessary to give the Childe right to Baptism, but what is essentially requisite unto <hi>regular Membership.</hi> As for other and further qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions pointed to in the Proposition (as, <hi>Giving account of their assent to the Doctrine of Faith, Solemn owning of the Covenant, &amp;c.</hi>) they properly belong to the <hi>manner of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration.</hi> Yet these are not therefore <hi>needless things,</hi> nor may they be disregarded, or boldly slighted and refused by any (<hi>because Membership alone gives Right</hi>) for God hath made it <hi>one Commandment</hi> of <hi>four,</hi> to provide for the <hi>manner</hi> of his Worship, requiring that all his holy Ordinances be attended in a Solemn, Humble, Reverent and Profitable manner: and it cannot be denyed to be meet and needful, that persons should both <hi>know</hi> and <hi>own</hi> the Covenant-state they are in, and the state of subjection to Christs Government, which the Covenant placeth them in, especially when they partake of such a fruit of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant as Baptism for their Children is: that they should do <hi>Covenant-duties,</hi> when they come for <hi>Covenant priviledges</hi>; that they should both seek and attend the Lords holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance (though it be their Right never so much) in <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Fear</hi>: and it being one <hi>Branch</hi> of the Covenant, that they <hi>give up their Children to the Lord,</hi> and do promise to take care for their Christian Education, it must needs be suitable that they be minded of it when they present them to Baptism, and the more explicitely they do so promise, it is the better. Hence all <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> do in their <hi>Directories,</hi> and <hi>Practices,</hi> require <hi>Professions,</hi> and <hi>Promises</hi> of Parents, or those that present the Childe to Baptism, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point a solemn <hi>manner</hi> of <hi>Administration,</hi> and stand upon it as a needful duty. Though they unanimously own and grant, that the Childe hath a full and clear <hi>Right</hi> to Baptism by its being born <hi>within the visible Church.</hi> See <hi>English Leiturgie</hi> of the administration of Baptism. <hi>Directory,</hi> pag. 31. <hi>Late Petition for Peace,</hi> pag. 61, &amp;c. <hi>Zepperi Polit.

                     </gap> to God upon such an occasion as the Baptizing of a Childe, by humbling himself before God for all neglects and Breaches of his Covenant, by taking hold of the incouraging promises of Grace in Christ, in reference unto the Children of the Covenant; and by pouring out earnest Prayer to God for his Childe, and for an heart to do the duty of a Christian Parent toward his Childe, as doth become him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And such things as these, Parents may and ought to be stirred up unto in the <hi>Ministry</hi> of the Word, as their duty. But still we must distinguish between what belongs to the <hi>manner of Administration,</hi> or to the <hi>better and more comfortable</hi> attendance thereof, and between what is <hi>essentially requisite</hi> to give <hi>right</hi> and title to the Ordinance <hi>before the Church.</hi> This latter, meer Membership (or Membership alone) doth. A state of Membership in the visible Church, is that unto which the right of Baptism is annexed <note n="(k)" place="margin">It is not the qualifications of one in full Communion, but his Membership that gives his Childe right to Baptism; for sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose he decay in qualification, and grow formal and loose, yet while he continues a Member uncensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, he hath his Childe baptized as well as the best in the Church.</note>, as not onely the Synod, but the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture teacheth. And so,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Assertion before-mentioned (<hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>it is not meer Membership, but qualified Membership that gives right to Baptism:</hi> in the sense above given) is also <hi>Antiscriptural</hi>; 1. Because it directly overthroweth <hi>Infant-baptism,</hi> which the Scripture establisheth: for what have Infants more then Membership (or Federal holiness, or Covenant-interest) to give them right to Baptism? <hi>i. e.</hi> What have they more then this, that they are regularly (by the Rules of Gods Word, and his Institution therein) within the visible Church? If this will not suffice, but there must be some other qualifications besides, and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added unto this, what shall become of them? For our parts, we know no stronger Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for Infants-baptism then <hi>that; Church members, or</hi> Foederati, <hi>are to be baptized: the Infants of the Faithful are Church-members, or</hi> Foederati: <hi>Ergo.</hi> But if the foresaid Assertion hold, this Argument fails, and falls short: for now <hi>Church-membership,</hi> or to be in Covenant, or Federal holiness, will not serve the turn, but there must be <hi>more then this</hi> to give <hi>right</hi> to Baptism. How the <hi>sinews</hi> of the strongest Arguments of the <hi>Synod</hi> for <hi>Enlargement</hi> of Baptism will fare, we know not; but sure we are, that this cuts in sunder the <hi>sinews</hi> of the strongest Arguments for <hi>Infant-baptism,</hi> which must fall if this stand. But fall it never will (through Grace) while the Lords Appointment in the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> of <hi>Abraham</hi> stands, <hi>viz.</hi> to have the <hi>Initiating Seal</hi> run <hi>parallel</hi> with the <hi>Covenant,</hi> Gen. 17. or <hi>Christs Commission,</hi> Matth. 28.19. <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>Baptize all Disciples,</hi> or all Members of the visible Church under the New Testament. Let this Assertion therefore fall, which makes the extent of the Initiatory Seal shorter then the Covenant, and denies Baptism to run parallel with Church-membership under the Gospel. Hence, 2. It contradicts that which the Harmony of Scripture, and all Orthodox Divines acknowledge for a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>the whole visible Church</hi> (i. e. now under the New Testament) <hi>ought to be baptized</hi>; or that <hi>all Church members are Subjects of Baptism:</hi> for, if not meer Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership (or Membership alone) but qualified Membership gives right to Baptism; then <hi>not all Members,</hi> but <hi>some</hi> onely, <hi>viz.</hi> those that be so and so qualified, are to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed. If Baptism do not belong to meer Membership, or to a Member <hi>as such,</hi> then not to all Members: as <hi>à quatenus ad omne,</hi> so <hi>à non quatenus ad non omne valet consequentiae.</hi> This denies not onely in the Fifth, but the First Proposition of the late Synod (which yet the <hi>Antisynodalia,</hi> pag. 17. seem to consent unto.) But let the Arguments that are given from Scripture to confirm that First Proposition, be duely weighed, and they will be found to be of greater weight then to be shaken by this Assertion.</p>
                  <p>Now for the Proof of this Assertion; viz. <hi>Because</hi> John<hi>'s Baptism, which was Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Baptism, might not be applied to some who were standing Members of the visible Church, because they were not qualified with Repentance,</hi> Luke 3.8. &amp; 7.30. <hi>Therefore Christian Baptism is not to be applied unto such as stand Members in the visible Church, if they be not qualified with fruits of Repentance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Let this be answered with reference to <hi>Infant-baptism,</hi> which lies upon our <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> to do, as well as on us, seeing they above declared <hi>Antipoedobaptism</hi> to be a <hi>sinful Opinion,</hi> and do profess to hold and maintain the baptizing of Infants: though indeed the <hi>Reader</hi> could not gather so much from these words [<hi>Christian Baptism is not to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied unto such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Repentance.</hi>] This seems directly to gainsay Infant-baptism; for Infants do indeed stand Members of the visible Church, but how do they or can they shew that they are qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified with <hi>fruits</hi> of Repentance? for it seems that neither is <hi>Repentance</hi> it self sufficient without [<hi>Fruits</hi>] of Repentance. But we are to suppose our Brethren do not intend to oppose Infant-baptism, and therefore that their meaning is not to require these fruits of Repentance (or qualifications superadded to Membership) of the <hi>Children</hi> or person<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But, let this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from <hi>Iohn</hi>'s requiring of qualifications over and above Membership, be answered, with reference to Infant-baptism, and that will answer it as to the case in hand.

                     <hi>and both in words, and by their action in desiring to be baptized, they professed their fear of the wrath of God, and desire to escape it.</hi> But if any do stand guilty of <hi>Open Scandals,</hi> we know not why they should not make <hi>particular Confession of their sin</hi> therein, when they come to present themselves before God, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire Baptism for their Children, if they have not done it before (so saith the same <hi>Chem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitius</hi> in the same place of them; <hi>Moreover, such as stood guilty of more grievous falls, did also confess them in particular.</hi>) To be sure, they should by the <hi>Discipline</hi> of the Church be brought to that, whether they had Children to be baptized or no, but <hi>then</hi> may be a fitting season for it.</p>
                  <p>Thus there may be cause and call for a <hi>special Repentance</hi> in special cases (when persons have so carried it, as to <hi>shake</hi> their standing in the visible Church) and although the Rule owns the Childe to be a Member of the Church, and so a Subject of Baptism, while it allows the Parent to be a Member not cut off; yet it is a <hi>Covenant-duty</hi> of the Parent to confess his sin in such a case: and so shall Baptism be administred with greater honour to God, and comfort to all that are concerned. But otherwise, while the Parent that was born in the Church, regularly continues in it, <hi>without Scandal,</hi> he is <hi>Ecclesiastically</hi> accounted to have the <hi>being</hi> of Repentance, and so to have the <hi>thing</hi> which <hi>Iohn</hi> required of them, though not the same <hi>modus</hi> of <hi>Manifestation,</hi> and discovery thereof.</p>
                  <p>Now follows the fifth Reason of our Brethrens Dissent, which is this; <hi>That which will not make a man capable of receiving Baptism himself, in case he were unbaptized, doth not make him capable of transmitting right of Baptism unto his Childe: but all that the Synod hath said will not give a man Right to Baptism himself in case he were unbaptized; therefore all that the Synod hath said is not enough to make a man capable of transmitting right of Baptism unto his Childe.</hi> Whereunto is added somewhat out of <hi>Bucer, Parker</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> as concurring with the judgement of our Brethren.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Taking [<hi>Capable of receiving Baptism himself,</hi> or <hi>Right to Baptism himself</hi>] for a <hi>state of Baptism-right,</hi> or <hi>Capacity,</hi> we may grant the <hi>Major,</hi> but the <hi>Minor</hi> in manifestly to be denied. But taking it for a <hi>frame of actual fitness</hi> to receive Baptism, we cannot say that we may grant the <hi>Minor,</hi> but surely the <hi>Major</hi> will not hold.</p>
                  <p>It is true, that <hi>That which doth not put a man into a state of right to Baptism for himself in case he were unbaptized</hi> (i. e. into a state of Church-membership) <hi>will not enable him to give Baptism-right to his Childe.</hi> If the Parent be <hi>not a Member,</hi> or not in <hi>a state of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant interest,</hi> none of us plead for the Childes Baptism. And if he be a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

But it is possible for an adult person, being in the state of a Member, and so of right to Baptism, to have something fall in which may hinder the <hi>actual application</hi> of Baptism to himself (in case he were unbaptized) or his <hi>actual fitness</hi> for it: And yet the same thing may not hinder a person <hi>already baptized,</hi> and standing in <hi>a Covenant-state,</hi> from conveying <hi>Baptism-right</hi> to his Childe. The reason is, because the <hi>right</hi> of the Childe depends upon <hi>the state</hi> of the Parent (that he be in a state of Membership: for if so, then Divine Institution carrieth or transmitteth Membership, and so Baptism-right to the Childe) but the Parents regular partaking of this or that Ordinance for himself, depends much upon his <hi>own actual fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> for it. As suppose an unbaptized adult person admitted into the Church, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is baptized falls into some great Offence (though such a case could hardly fall out, if Baptism were administred according to the Rule, and Apostolical Practice, i. e. <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon first Admission,</hi> Matth. 28.19. Acts 16.33. much more is it an harsh and strange supposition for a Parent that ought to have been, and was baptized in his Infancy,

In like manner, if a person already baptized, yea or already in full Communion, should fall into offence, you would say that would put a stop to his own Baptism, in case (upon an impossible supposition) he were yet unbaptized; but what Rule or Reason is there for it, to make a <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular offence</hi> in the Parent, to cut o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> is by Rule to be put out? when as the offence doth not cut off the <hi>Parents Membership,</hi> is there any reason it should cut off the <hi>Membership of the Childe?</hi> and if it cut not of the Childes Membership, it doth not cut off his <hi>right to Baptism</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Whatever may be said for requiring the Parent to <hi>confess his sin</hi> before his Childes Baptism, in reference to the more expedient and comfortable manner of Administration (therein we oppose not) yet where doth the Scripture allows us to <hi>disannull</hi> the Childes <hi>right</hi> to Baptism upon <hi>a particular offence</hi> in the Parent, especially when it is not such as doth touch upon the Essentials of Christianity, and notwithstanding which, the Parent is regularly and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly continued a Member of the Church? It remains therefore that there may be obstructions to a Parents receiving Baptism for himself, in case he were unbaptized, which do not incapaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate a baptized Parent to transmit (if we may attribute <hi>transmitting</hi> to a Parent, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the act of Gods Institution and Covenant) right of Baptism unto his Childe.</p>
                  <p>But for the <hi>Minor</hi> or <hi>Assumption</hi> of the Argument in hand, it will not hold in <hi>either</hi> of the <hi>senses</hi> of the <hi>Proposition</hi> above given. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We will readily grant, that if the Parent be not in <hi>a state of Baptism-right</hi> himself, <hi>i. e.</hi> in <hi>a state of Membership,</hi> he cannot convey Baptism-right to his Childe; but how manifest is it, that that which the <hi>Synod</hi> hath said in their <hi>fifth Proposition,</hi> doth render the persons there described in a state of right to Baptism for themselves, in case they were unbaptized, viz. <hi>In a state of Membership in the visible Church</hi>; for the <hi>Proposition</hi> speaks of <hi>Church-members,</hi> such as were <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted</hi> Members <hi>in minority,</hi> and do <hi>orderly</hi> and <hi>regularly</hi> so <hi>continue:</hi> and that a state of Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership is a state of Baptism-right, or that all Church-members are in the state of Subjects of Baptism, is an evident Truth that cannot be denied by any that grant the <hi>Synods first Proposition</hi>; for which there is Sun-light in Scripture, and never was Orthodox Divine heard of that questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned it. Hence according to that <hi>Ruled Case</hi> here mentioned, the Parents in question having <hi>themselves a title</hi> to Baptism, may intitle others; they have not onely <hi>a title</hi> to it, but regular and actual <hi>Possession</hi> of it, for they are baptized, and in case they were yet unbaptized, they would, being Church-members, have a title of right unto it (they would stand possessed of an interest in a title to it, as Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> in the place here alledged speaks) whatever might <hi>de facto</hi> hinder their enjoyment of it. And as <hi>à non habente potestatem,</hi> acts are <hi>invalid</hi>; so <hi>ab ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bente potestatem</hi> they are <hi>valid</hi> and good: but God hath full power to give forth what Grants he pleaseth, and he hath in the order of his Covenant in the visible Church, granted a Membership, and so Baptism-right unto Children born of Parents that are Members, and so the Parent that stands Member of the Church, hath as an instrument under God, and from his Grant, power to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

And in another place, <hi>Quantum equidem assequi possum,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>As far as I can gather</hi> (saith he) <hi>the Anabaptist's onely reason why they dislike Infant baptism, is, Because they fancy to themselves that the Church would be more pure, if we baptized none but the adult, and such as hold forth eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Spirit: and so they think but a few would have place in Churches. But by this means doubtless it would come to pass, that many of Christs Sheep would be neglected as Goats: neither would all Parents be so careful as they think, in educating their Children unto piety. And yet this humane thought (which savours of too much esteem of our own works) doth so possess them, that they bring all to this, and turn off all that can be said, and hereby they run themselves into very great errours. I called it</hi> an humane thought, <hi>for no Scripture doth command such a curious circumspection, lest any Goats should be received into the Church. The Apostles often baptized persons with whom they had scarce had an hours speech concerning Christ; because, according to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of the Gospel, they would bring in all they met with to the Marriage</hi> (Mat. 22.10.) <hi>For by Baptism they only took them into the School of Piety, and Trained-hand of Christians; and they were wont then to cast them out again, when it was evidently enough perceived that to labour in teaching them was in vain.</hi> Ibid. fol. 53.</p>

                  <p>But here our Brethren will needs <hi>take notice, that the judgment of that worthy and for ever famous Mr.</hi> Cotton <hi>was as theirs is,</hi> because he hath these words, (in <hi>Holiness of Church-members,</hi> pag. 93) <hi>I conceive (under favour) more positive fruits of Regeneration are required in the Church-members of the New Testament then of the Old.</hi>

                     <hi>Ans.</hi> The <hi>Reader</hi> will <hi>take notice</hi> of what hath been before said, and cited to shew Mr. <hi>Cottons</hi> judgement in the Points controverted between our Brethren and the Synod, and will easily thereby judge <hi>whether Mr.</hi> Cottons <hi>judgement was as theirs is:</hi> but It is strange they should make such a Collection from what is here set down. Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> might say those words that are here expressed, and yet his judgement be farre enough from being as theirs is in any of the Points that are controverted: for we shall not gainsay this Conception of Mr. <hi>Cottons [That more positive fruits of Regeneration are required in the Church members of the New Testament, then of the Old]</hi> but concur with it in two respects, or for two causes: 1. Because the <hi>Light</hi> now is greater and clearer then it was then, and where <hi>more is given, more is required,</hi> Luke 12.48. 2. Because the <hi>Discipline</hi> appointed under the Old Testament was <hi>mostly Ceremonial</hi> (<hi>Ames Medul.</hi> lib. 1. c. 38. Thes. 41.) And whether <hi>Excommunication</hi> for <hi>Moral evils,</hi> was then used, at least <hi>out of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church,</hi> is by some doubted: As also whether persons were debarred from the holy things simply for Moral evils, if they were ceremonially clean; as Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> in the place here alledged saith, <hi>It is true, that it is a question whether sins very scandalous did keep men ceremonially clean from the Temple and Sacrifices:</hi> But under the New Testament we have a plain and undoubted Rule, for the Censure of Excommunication for Moral evils persisted in: hence persons might haply run further into Moral evils (and so further off from the fruits of Regeneration) <hi>then,</hi> and yet not be put out of the Church (yea haply not be debarred from the holy things) then they can do <hi>now.</hi> But what is all this to the matter in hand? for still it is not <hi>secret irregeneration,</hi> nor the bare <hi>want</hi> of such and such <hi>positive fruits</hi> of Regeneration, without <hi>positive and palpable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the Church, when he is once in. Nay, Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> in the very place here cited, expresly saith, that Irregeneration alone will not keep a man out:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Holiness of Church-members,</hi> pag 92.</note> His words are these [<hi>Neither amongst us doth Irregeneration alone keep any from Church-fellowship with us: not Irregeneration alone (I say) unles it be accompanied with such fruits as are openly scandalous, and do convincingly manifest Irregeneration.</hi>] Moreover, still the <hi>parallel</hi> between the Church of the <hi>Old</hi> and of the <hi>New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament</hi>; stands and holds in this, that when a person is once by Gods appointment taken into the visible Church (whether in adult age or in infancy, it comes all to one for that) he <hi>continues</hi> in it, and doth not lose his Membership, till <hi>by some Rule or Appointment of God</hi> in his Word he be <hi>cut off</hi> or <hi>cast out.</hi> What the <hi>particular Rules</hi> and wayes of <hi>cutting off</hi> were in the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> we need not here dispute, but to be sure the <hi>plain Rule</hi> in the <hi>New Testament</hi> for the cutting off of particular persons, is by the <hi>Censure</hi> of <hi>Excommunication for Moral evils.</hi>

                     </hi> and <hi>break</hi> the heart, and to <hi>draw</hi> it home unto God.

If he have any more, he may have the more comfort in it; but simply to have his Childe Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, on the grounds we go upon, affirms no more but this, because we ground all upon federal Holiness, or Membership in the visible Church.</p>
                  <p>It is true, that <hi>Baptism is a Seal of the whole Covenant of Grace, as well as the Lords Supper:</hi> But it is as true, 1. That it is a Seal of the Covenant of Grace, <hi>as dispensed in the visible Church,</hi> or it is a Seal of the Covenant of Grace, <hi>as clothed with the external dispensation or administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof,</hi> and so it doth <hi>nextly</hi> and <hi>immediately</hi> Seal the external dispensation, or the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and Priviledges that belong thereto (which are a part of the whole Covenant of Grace) and then it seals the inward and saving benefits of the Covenant <hi>as included</hi> in that dispensation, and <hi>upon the Conditions</hi> therein propounded. Baptism seals the whole Covenant, and whole dispensation thereof, <hi>i. e.</hi> 1. The dispensation of it <hi>Outwardly,</hi> to all that have an <hi>external standing</hi> in the Church. 2.

                  <p>In sum, we make account, that if we keep <hi>Baptism</hi> within the compass of the <hi>Non-excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable,</hi> and the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> within the compass of those that have (unto Charity) <hi>somewhat of the Power of Godliness</hi> (or <hi>Grace in exercise</hi>) we shall be near about the right Middle-way of Church-Reformation.

<q>That the members of the Church in the Patriarchs Families, were to continue in communion with the Church from their being circumcised, all the dayes of their life, untill they were cast out, as <hi>Ishmael</hi>— or voluntarily departed from it, as <hi>Esau.</hi>
                     </q>
And doth not this sufficiently imply, That children in those Churches, when adult, were under Discipline in those Churches? For, can we think that those Churches had no Church-discipline in them? or that the Members of them were not under that Discipline? or the children, when grown up, were not Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers? Sure, if they continued in communion with the Church from their being circumcised, all the dayes of their life, until they were <hi>cast out,</hi> or did <hi>voluntarily go away</hi>; then it was not meer <hi>growing up to be adult,</hi> that caused their Church-relation, or communion with the Church, to cease. And if their communion with the Church did not cease, but <hi>continue,</hi> how can it be avoided but they were under Church-discipline? Where shall we finde ground from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture or good Reason, that these children, when adult, did still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in communion with the Church, and yet were not under the Church-discipline that then was? It seems to us, that the <hi>one</hi> of these, which the Reverend Author doth expresly affirm, doth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably imply the <hi>other,</hi> which is affirmed by the Synod. There might be many children in those Families of the Patriarchs, who when they were adult, were neither <hi>cast out, as</hi> Ishmael, nor <hi>departed, as</hi> Esau; and these continuing in communion with the Church <hi>all the dayes of their life, from their being circumcised,</hi> as the Reverend Author saith they did, they were therefore under the Church-disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline that then was. And if they might be <hi>cast out,</hi> as <hi>Ishmael</hi> was, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21. as the Reverend Author confesseth; it cannot be denied but that there was Discipline in those Churches, and that children, when grown up, were subject thereto: For, as for that which the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend <hi>Author</hi> suggesteth, <hi>pag.</hi> 11.
<q>That <hi>Ishmael</hi> being thirteen years old when he was circumcised, was then admitted into Church-fellowship
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:46467:25"/>
and full communion by his personal Covenanting, being at years of discretion.</q>
The Answer is, That it is very unusual that children at <hi>thirteen years of age</hi> should be fit for full communion. And as for <hi>Ishmael,</hi> there is no such thing testified of him in the Scripture; but on the contrary, when the Lord saith, He should be <hi>a wilde man, and his hand against every man, and every mans hand against him,</hi> Gen. 16. &amp; when as he soon after became such <hi>a Mocker</hi> and <hi>Persecutor,</hi> Gen. 21. Gal. 4. as that for it he was <hi>cast out,</hi> Gen. 21. it is therefore not very probable that he at <hi>thirteen years of age</hi> had so much goodness in him, as that upon the profession thereof he should then be admitted to full communion. It seems to us more probable, considering the things mentioned, that he was <hi>admitted as a childe in minori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> and yet when grown up, he was so under Discipline, as to be <hi>cast out</hi> for his wickedness.</p>
                  <p>And for that other of <hi>Mosaicall Discipline,</hi> the <hi>Reverend Author</hi> confesseth, <hi>p.</hi> 11, 12.
<q>That all the grown members of the Church of Israel were brought under such Discipline, as was established in that Church by a solemn Covenant, whereof all adult persons were to take hold personally.</q>
And if all the grown members of that Church were brought under <hi>such discipline as was then established,</hi> then the other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular in the Antecedent, <hi>That children were u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>der Mosaicall discipline,</hi> is here also confessed by the Author. Indeed, he conceiveth they were <hi>brought under Discipline by Covenanting personally</hi>; but that is not clear: but for the thing it self, <hi>That they were under Discipline,</hi> this we see is by him confessed; which is that which the Synod affirmed. And why may not that Text, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.3. be a sufficient proof thereof? If they that were circumcised, were bound to all the duties of the Law, as the Text affirmeth; then they were bound to that Ecclesiastical Discipline that the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> appointed: and therefore chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren being circumcised, were so bound, even when they were adult, for then they remained circumcised. There are good Expositors who upon that Text do teach, <hi>That Circumcision was an obligation to the keeping of all the Commandments of the Law in the Old Testament, and that Baptism is the like for all the Commandments of the Gospel:</hi> See <hi>Paraeus,</hi> and <hi>Perkins in loc.</hi> Whereby it appeareth; That what
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:46467:26"/>
Discipline was under the Old Testament, children circumcised in Infancy were subject thereto, when adult, as being <hi>bound by their Circumcision to all the Commandments of the Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So much for <hi>Defence</hi> of the Antecedent in this Argument.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>But, <hi>saith the Reverend Author,</hi> though the Antecedent were more manifestly true, yet the Consequent is not good; for there is not <hi>par ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio,</hi> the like reason of those Patriarchal and Mosaical Churches, and of Congregational Churches under the Gospel, <hi>page 11.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> And yet the Reverend Author confesseth in <hi>Position the fifth and sixth,</hi>
                     <q>That the Covenant of Abraham was the same in substance under the Law, and under the Gospel: and, that the Kingdome of God, is the same in substance which is taken from the Iews, and given to the Gentiles; yea, and that Baptisme is come in the place of Circumcision, and therefore Infants of Confederates are now to be Baptized, as then they were to be circumcised, they being both outward seales of the same Covenant in substance.</q>
So that here seems to be a plain acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment that there is <hi>par ratio,</hi> though in the place in hand it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied. For, if the Covenant be for <hi>Substance</hi> the same now as it was then, and that therefore Baptism may be now dispensed to Infants, as circumcision was then, those ordinances being both seales of the same covenant for <hi>Substance</hi>; is not this an acknowledgment of a <hi>par ratio</hi> between them? and if so, what should hinder but that Children, when grown up, may as well be under Church-discipline now, as under the Old Testament? for, may they be now Baptized in their infancy, as then they were Circumcised, because there is in both <hi>par ratio?</hi> and might they be then under Church-discipline, and yet now not so, because here there is not <hi>par ratio?</hi> Is Poedobap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme in the new Testament, rightly inferred from the Circumcision of Infants in the old Testament, because here there is <hi>par ratio</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them? and is not their subjection to Church-discipline, when adult, in the new Testament, rightly inferred from the like subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Old? It doth not appear that there is any want of <hi>par ratio</hi> in the one case, any more then in the other.</p>
                  <p>As for that which is here immediately brought in <hi>pag.</hi> 11. to prove that there is not, <hi>par ratio</hi>; viz.
<q>Because the members of the Church, in the Patriarchs families, were to continue in Communion
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:46467:26"/>
with the Church all the dayes of their life, until they were cast out, as <hi>Ishmael</hi> or voluntarily departed from it, as <hi>Esau.</hi>
                     </q>
We conceive this is no proof at all of the disparity alledged; and the reason is, because we say the very same concerning the Children of Church-members in these dayes, <hi>viz.</hi> that they still continue in the Church all the dayes of their life, if they be not cast out in a Gospel way, which he doth not disprove. And therfore in this there is no want of <hi>par ratio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And for the proof of disparity between the Church of Israel, and our Churches, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <q>
                        <hi>1.</hi> That we do not read of any Ordinance given them, for casting out Members for sins against the Moral Law. And <hi>2.</hi> That the grown Members of that Church were brought under such discipline as was established in that Church, by a solemn Covenant, whereof all adult persons were to take hold personally.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Answer is; Touching the former of these, that sundry things may be said to shew, that it is very probable that in Israel there was appointed of God an Ordinance of Church-censure or d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Is it likely, that if a man should eat <hi>Leavened bread</hi> in the time of the <hi>Passeover,</hi> that for this he must be cut off from the Congregation, as <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.15, 19. or if a man should <hi>touch a dead body,</hi> or <hi>a bone of a Man,</hi> or <hi>a grave, &amp;c.</hi> that this were such uncleanness, as that he must not then enter into the Tabernacle or Temple, but, if he did, it would be <hi>a defiling of the Sanctuary of the Lord,</hi> and therefore such offenders must be <hi>cut off from their People?</hi> and yet nevertheless, if a man had <hi>killed another man,</hi> or had <hi>commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the sin of Whoredome,</hi> or <hi>Drunkeness,</hi> or <hi>other abomination,</hi> that yet there was no such uncleanness in these as to <hi>defile the Sanctuary,</hi> or to cause a man to be <hi>kept out,</hi> or <hi>cut off,</hi> or <hi>cast out</hi> for the same?

                  <p>To the third Argument, to prove <hi>Children of Church-members, when adult, to be under the Watch, Discipline, and Government of the Church</hi>; viz.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Because they are Disciples, and therefore under Discipline in Christs School.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Reverend Author's <hi>Answer</hi> hath in it <hi>a Concession,</hi> and <hi>an Exception:</hi> The <hi>Concession</hi> is,

                  </p>
                  <p>But though the Reverend Author yield, as is said, yet he puts in this Exception;
<q>That he findes not any where in Scripture, that such adult persons are styled Disciples, or accounted Members.</q>

                     </gap>ke unto it, one answer may serve for both the Arguments; which is this, That the major Propositions in both do not universally and absolutely hold but onely so far as the persons are capable; so far <hi>all Disciples</hi> that are to be Baptized, and <hi>all adult persons</hi> that are Disciples, are to observe <hi>all Christs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments</hi>: but as this doth not exclude <hi>Infants</hi> from being Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and from being Baptized; so neither are the <hi>adult person</hi>

of excluded from being Disciples, though neither the one nor the other be yet fit for observing <hi>all Christs</hi> Commandments, in full communion, in all the Ordinances.</p>
                  <p>To the fourth Argument; <hi>They are in Church-covenant, therefore subject to Church-power,</hi> Gen. 17.7. &amp; 18.19.</p>
                  <p>The Answer is,
<q>That they are not in covenant <hi>dejure,</hi> being adult, and not admitted into Church-communion in all Ordinances.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> And yet the Text saith, the Covenant of <hi>Abraham</hi> is <hi>with him, and his seed in their generations,</hi> Gen. 17.7. and this Reverend Author will not deny, but that
<q>Those that are in the covenant in their Infancy, are thereby left under engagement to service and subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to Christ in his Church, when they shall be grown up, and that this engagement upon them is strong— To know the God of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and to serve him with a perfect heart and a willng mind <hi>p. 44.</hi> so that if they do it not, but live in neglect or contempt of the Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, or unsuitable conversation, they hereby live in the breach of that covenant, whereby they were left under engagement in their Infancy, <hi>pag 43.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> but the sins of these adult persons are <hi>breach of covenant,</hi> therefore they are <hi>in the covenant</hi>: therefore that cannot stand which is here said, <hi>That these adult per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, that were in covenant in their Infancy, are not now in covenant when adult, until they be admitted into Church-communion in all Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the fifth Argument, viz. <hi>They are Subjects of the Kingdome of Christ, and therefore under the Laws and Government of his Kingdom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Answer is,
<q>That this Argument may be retorted against themselves, and the proofs of it, thus: The Subjects of Christs King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome have full communion in all the priviledges of Christs Kingdome, but these adult persons have not so, <hi>ex-confesso,</hi> therefore they are

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> The sum is, The Subjects of Christs Kingdome have full communion in all the Priviledges of Christs Kingdome: But the adult persons spoken of have not such communion: <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>go.</hi> But is this true, that <hi>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> the Subjects of Christs Kingdome have full commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in all the Priviledges of it,</hi> even <hi>in all,</hi> and not in <hi>some onely,</hi> i. e. in all Ordinances?

Exclude these <hi>adult persons</hi> from being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Laws and Government of Christs Kingdome, because they have not communion in <hi>all the Priviledges of it,</hi> and by the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son we may <hi>exclude Infants:</hi> allow <hi>Infants</hi> to be Subjects of Christs Kingdome, and partakers of <hi>some Priviledges</hi> of it, <hi>viz.</hi> such as they are <hi>capable of,</hi> though not of <hi>all</hi>; and then why may not the like be yielded concerning the adult persons spoken of?</p>
                  <p>To the sixth Argument, the <hi>Answer</hi> returned, is,
<q>That this is the same with the third, and therefore the same Answer may serve for this also.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> If this were so, then our <hi>Defence</hi> of the third, may be a <hi>Defence</hi> of this also: Nevertheless, it seemeth this Argument is not the same with the third, but distinct from it, the <hi>Mediums</hi> in them not being the same, but distinct: for in the one, the Argument is from their <hi>being disciples,</hi> or <hi>Scholars,</hi> and therefore <hi>under discipline in</hi>

<q>That those Children were either Children in their Minority, or if adult, they were personally joyned to the Church, and so in full Communion.</q>
For, let the words and scope of the Text be considered, and we conceive it will appear, that this exposition of the place is too narrow; for the <hi>Children</hi> there spoken of, are such as were bound to <hi>obey their Parents in the Lord, this being right,</hi> and such as were under the fifth Commandment; the words whereof the Apostle doth there alledge, <hi>Honour thy Father and Mother, &amp;c.</hi> Now how shall it appear, that though Children in minority, and children when admitted into <hi>full communion</hi> in the Church, are bound to <hi>obey their Parents,</hi> and to <hi>Honour Father and Mother,</hi> yet other children are not so bound?

                  <p>As for that which is here said by the Reverend Author,
<q>That the Churches censuring of adult persons, admitted before they be qualified for communion in all Ordinances, will not prevent or heal those evils, seeing the Lord blesseth onely his own Institutions, not mens Devices; and that Humane Inventions usually cause the evils which they pretend to cure, <hi>pag. 15.</hi>

                  <p>So much for <hi>Defence</hi> of what is said by the Synod in their third Proposition, to prove, <hi>That the children of Church-members, when grown up, are under the Watch, Discipline, and Government of the Church.</hi>

The fourth Proposition of the Synod, is, <hi>That these adult Persons are not therefore to be admitted to full communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, meerly because they are and continue Members, without such further qualifications as the word of God requireth thereunto.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By which Proposition of the Synod, there is a preventing of an usual objection from <hi>the danger of polluting the Ordinances by unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy partakers,</hi> if the children of Church-members be counted mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and to be (as such) under Church-watchfulness and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when adult; for some may think, that if this their relation to the Church be granted, there will then be danger that they will also come to the Lords Supper afore they be duely qualified for that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance: now the scope of this fourth Proposition is to prevent this evil; and therefore it is the more to be admired, that the Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on should not be granted by the Reverend Author, and by all that desire the Lords Supper may be preserved from <hi>unworthy partakers,</hi> as we do not doubt but he doth. But why then is this Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on stuck at? if it may not be granted, that these adult persons are not to be <hi>admitted to f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>For, saith he,
<q>Though this Proposition seems to them plain, yet it seems not sufficiently cleared by their Proofs: <hi>1. From 1</hi> Cor. <hi>11.28, 29.</hi>
                     </q>
where it is required, that such as come to the Lords Supper, be able to examine themselves, and discerne the Lords body, else they will eat and drink unworthily, and eat and drink judgement to themselves,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:46467:33"/>
when they partake of this Ordinance:
<q>But this ability is too of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </p>
                  <p>To this Argument the reply of the Reverend Author is by way of Concession, and of Exception.</p>
                  <p>His Concessions are two:
<q>
                        <hi>1.</hi> That the want of such abilities in the children of the covenant, is indeed too often seen, through the too frequent neglect of Parents in their Education, and of Ministers and Churches in their Institution, <hi>(or Instruction)</hi> and Catechizing, and watching over them, <hi>pag. 17.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> It seems then that the children of Church-members, even when they are grown up to years (for it is of such that the Synods Argument here speaketh, and so the Reverend Author doth express it) are not only under the <hi>Education of Parents,</hi> but also under the <hi>Institution, Catechizing and watch of the Ministry, and of the Church</hi>; how then will that stand which was said before, pag. 10.
<q>That when they are grown up, they are not under the watch, discipline and government of the Church?</q>
for here it is granted, that they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>watch of the Church</hi> (and if under Church-watch properly as such, then under Discipline) and that the neglect of Ministers and Churches herein, is <hi>one cause</hi> of their want of <hi>ability to examine themselves, and to discern the Lords body.</hi> Now can the neglect of Church-watchfulness be a cause of this evil, if the Lord have not appointed them to be under the same? these things seem not well to agree. Again, if the <hi>want of such abilities</hi> be too often seen in the children of the covenant when grown up, as is here acknowledged; then what the Synod here saith seems to be true, and stand good, that such <hi>grown persons,</hi> though children of the covenant, or Church-members, are not therefore to be admitted to full communion: the reason is, because notwithstanding this, they may <hi>want that ability</hi> that is requisite to such full communion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The second Concession here is,
<q>That Membership is separable from, yea destitute of such-ability in the Infant-seed or children of the covenant, in their minority, and therefore they are not to be admitted to the Lords Supper; and that Text (<hi>viz. 1</hi> Cor. <hi>1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Exception he added, is,
<q>That yet it may not be granted, that when they are grown up to years, they are, and continue Members re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly, being through want of that ability not fit for Church-commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, (<hi>i. e.</hi> for full communion.)</q>

                  <p>The second Argument of the Synod for proof of this fourth Proposition, is <hi>From the Old Testament, where though men did continue Members of the Church, yet for ceremoniall uncleanness they were to be kept from full communion in the holy things; yea, and the Priests and Porters had speciall charge that men should not partake in all the holy things, unless duely qualified for the same, notwi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>hstanding their Membership,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>To this the Reverend Author Answereth,
<q>
                        <hi>1.</hi> That the invalidity of Proofes from the Old Testament, being applyed to Gospel-Ordinances, and so this of Baptism under the New Testament, in things whereof there is not the like reason, hath been declared in the fourth, sixth, and eighth Positions, with which this proof doth not agree.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> To this we Answer, 1. That there is validity, and much weight in proofs from the Old Testament, for confirming and clearing things under the New: for even those Scriptures were <hi>written for our learning,</hi> Rom. 15.4. and Christ himself bids us <hi>search them,</hi> as those which did <hi>Testifie of Him,</hi> Joh. 5.39. and brings many Proofs out of those Scriptures for confirming and clearing things under the Gospel, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.44, 45, 46. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16.29, 31. and so do the Apostles likewise, even in main &amp; fundamental matters, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.2, 3. <hi>&amp;</hi>
                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:46467:35"/>
28.23. and so from the <hi>maintenance of the Ministry</hi> that was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Old Testament, to the maintenance of the Ministry <hi>now,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.13. from <hi>their</hi> Sacraments to <hi>ours</hi>; and from the <hi>danger of unworthy receiving those,</hi> to the danger of unworthy receiving <hi>ours,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.1, 2. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By which, and much more that might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, it is plain, that the Scriptures of the Old Testament have much validity in them, for confirming and clearing Truths in New Testament-times.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Reverend Author doth acknowledge, as was noted before,
<q>That the covenant of <hi>Abraham</hi> is the same for substance, now under the Gospel, as it was under the Law; and that the Kingdome of God is the same to the Iews formerly, and to the Gentiles now; and that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme of Infants, under the New Testament, may be rightly proved from the Circumcision of Inf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nts under the Old.</q>
Which passages do sufficiently witness, that in his judgement there is validity in Proofs from the Old Testament, for things under the New.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is a great weakness and mistake in sundry of the <hi>Antipoedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists,</hi> that they would limit the Proofs for Infant-Baptism, and for the Covenant-interest of children, unto the Scriptures of the New Testament, as if the Covenant of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Infants in the Old Testament, were of no validity for the purpose mentioned. And it is not comfortable that the Reverend Author should so often harp upon this string, and so often men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this matter of the <hi>invalidity of Old Testament-Scriptures for proof of matters in Gospel times</hi>; as if he did concur with them, in their Tenet against <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>oedobaptism,</hi> which he frequently professeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst, albeit in this, his language seems but too like theirs, which we could wish were otherwise.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. For that expression of [<hi>Things whereof there is not the like reason</hi>] being a limitation, or explanation of the <hi>invalidity</hi> spoken of, let this be applyed to the case in question, and we conceive it will not weaken the <hi>Argument in hand,</hi> nor shew any <hi>Invalidity therein,</hi> but rather the contrary; for if Ceremonial uncleanness did hinder men from full communion in the Ordinances in the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, notwithstanding their Membership; is there not the like reason, or rather much more, that Membership alone should not suffice for
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:46467:35"/>
full communion in these dayes, if Moral fitness and Spiritual quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications be wanting? It seems in this case there is the like reason, or rather much more: and therefore the Synods Argument in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent case, and their proof from the Old Testament, cannot be laid aside, or refused, for any <hi>invalidity</hi> therein, through want of the like Reason</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Reverend Author saith,
<q>If the Texts alledged by the Synod were applicable to Church-members in Gospel-times, yet they suit not the case in question. <hi>And why not? the reason rendred, is,</hi> "Because all men that were members of the Iewish Church, had full communion in all Legal Ordinances, even they that were ceremonially unclean had so before their uncleanness, and after they were healed of their unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, as well as others.</q>
So then the <hi>unsuitableness</hi> is, that <hi>ceremoniall uncleannes,</hi> did debar men from full communion, though they had been partakers of it afore, and might be again after their cleansing: whereas the case in question is of <hi>such as yet never bad such full com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</hi> But what weight is there in this, to weaken the Synods Argument? If <hi>ceremoniall uncleanness</hi> did then hinder men from full communion, who had formerly had it is there not as much reason that <hi>want of spirituall qualifications</hi> should now binder men from such full communion, who yet have never had it? one would think such a matter as would suffice for the debarring of one from full communion, who had formerly enjoyed it, might suffice for hindring one from such communion who never yet was partaker thereof. And if the <hi>Priests and Porters</hi> in Israel had charge, that men should not <hi>partake of all the holy things, unless duely qualified for the same, notwithstanding their membership in f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ll communion with the Church</hi> (for so the Reverend Author, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.19. understands that place in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23 19.) doth it not much more follow, that such as yet never had such full communion may justly be kept theref<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ica,</hi> notwithstanding their Membership? For ought we see, this <hi>Consequence</hi> is strong and undeniable, and so the Synods Argument in this place from the <hi>Old Testamen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> is not at all overthrown, but rather more strengthned.</p>
                  <p>As for what the Reverend Author saith, <hi>pag.</hi> 18, 9. to the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Texts here alledged, <hi>viz.</hi> Levit. 7.20, 21. Numb. 9.6, 7. &amp; 19.13, 20. Ezek. 44.7, 8, 9. which he understandeth to signifie and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:46467:36"/>
teach,
<q>That in Gospel-times men should be removed ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> of Church-communion by Excommunication, if they were scandalous and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent sinners; and that such scandalous persons, such as were visibly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumcised in heart, and spiritually unclean, should not be admitted into the Church:</q>
We shall not insist upon these particulars, for it is our desire that no unworthy persons may be admitted into the Church, nor suffered to continue therein.</p>
                  <p>Onely before we leave this second Argument, it may be observed, That whereas the Synod had said, <hi>More was required to adult persons eating the Passover, then meer membership; therefore so there is now to the Lords Supper.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Reverend Author answereth,
<q>It is true, more then that mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership which they had in infancy or minority, was required in adult persons to eat the Passover: For first, when they became adult, they were to covenant solemnly with the Lord and his People in their own persons, whereunto Heart-fitness was necessary, that their persons and services might be accepted of God— Secondly, This Heart-fitness was also to be exercised when they were to eat the Passover, <hi>p. 19, 20.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherein there is a consent to what the Synod had said, about more then <hi>membership</hi> to be requisite to the <hi>eating of the Passover.</hi> And if this ground of the Synod be true and good, is not their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference from it good also, viz. <hi>That more then membership is also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite to the receiving of the Lords Supper?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third Argument of the Synod for confirming this fourth Proposition, is taken <hi>From the different nature of Baptism and the Lords Supper; the former firstly and properly sealing Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-holiness, Church-membership, and planting into Christ, and so Members as such are the subjects of that Ordinance: But the Lords Supper is a Sacrament of growth in Christ, and of speciall communion with him, and so supposeth a speciall renewing of Faith and Repentance in them that partake of that Ordinance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Reverend Author making answer to this, faith nothing at all touching the <hi>different nature</hi> of these two Ordinances, on which this Argument of the Synod is built; and so <hi>Baptism</hi> may be for <hi>all Church-members</hi> as such, and the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> not for <hi>all,</hi> but onely
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:46467:36"/>
                     <hi>for some,</hi> for any thing that the Reverend Author saith to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. For, as for the <hi>different nature</hi> of these two Ordinances, he saith nothing thereto at all: But his Answer is about the <hi>communion</hi> that is inferred from Church-membership, viz.
<q>That the member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of children in minority infers church-communion, so far as they are capable— and so they are to be baptized; but the Church-membership of adult persons infers communion in all Ordinances, and particularly in the Lords Supper.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which Answer, as it medleth not with the <hi>different nature of Baptism,</hi> and the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> from which the Synod argueth; so it is an Answer which being considered in it self, is nothing but a <hi>petitio principii,</hi> or a begging of the question, affirming that which is the thing to be proved: For, the Synods Proposition is, <hi>that these ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lt persons are not therefore to be admitted to full communion, meerly because they are and continue Members</hi>— and they give three Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for this. Now the Reverend Author in Answer to the third of those Arguments, saith, as here we see, <hi>that the Membership of adult persons, infers communion in all Ordinances, the Lords Supper, &amp;c.</hi> The Synod saith in effect, This Membership alone doth not infer full communion; and the Answer here given, is an affirming of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, viz. <hi>that it doth infer it</hi>; which Answer cannot goe for a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient overthrow of the Synods Proposition, unless we shall say, that a <hi>meer affirming of the contrary,</hi> is sufficient for that purpose. But if a contrary affirmation, be a sufficient confutation, it were easy in that way to confute the things that are most strongly proved.</p>
                  <p>For a conclusion of this fourth Proposition, and the Arguments for it, the Synod doth infer, <hi>That if Persons when adult may be, and continue Members, and yet be debarred from the Lords Supper, until meet qualifications for the same be found in them, then may they also (until like qualifications) be debarred from that power of voting in the Church, which pertaines to males in full communion: —for how can they who are not able to examine and judg themselves, be thought able and fit to discern and judge in the weighty affairs of the House of God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now what saith the Reverend Author to this? one thing he saith, is this,
<q>That Church-membership in adult Persons, infers communion
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:46467:37"/>
in all Ordinances, in the Lords Supper, and in Voting, and in Censures;</q>
Which is nothing but an affirmation of the contrary to the Synods Proposition, which they had confirmed by <hi>Arguments,</hi> and of their <hi>Inference</hi> therefrom: but until their Arguments be taken away, their Proposition, and their Inference from it, stands good: and therefore this affirmation of the contrary may not be admitted.</p>
                  <p>Another thing the Reverend Author here saith, is this,

                  <p>Where, if by receiving such into Membership be meant, that they were not members <hi>before now,</hi> when they are adult, but are now first received into that estate; Then the Answer is, That the adult persons spoken of are not now first received into Membership, but have been in that estate long since, even from their Infancy or minority, and therefore they cannot properly be said to be <hi>Now</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into Membership: but if hereby be meant, That they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not regularly be acknowledged to be Members, until they be fitly qualified for <hi>all Ordinances</hi>; for <hi>Voting,</hi> and for <hi>judging in Censures,</hi> then this is but the same which we had before, even an affirmation contrary to what the Synod had said.

For the fifth Proposition, viz. <hi>Church-members who were admitted in minority, understanding the Doctrine of Faith, and publickly professing their assent thereto; not scandalous in life, and solemnly owning the Covenant before the Church, wherein they give up themselves and their children to the Lord, and subject them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the Government of Christ in the Church, their children are to be Baptized.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first Argument of the Synod for confirming this Proposition, is; <hi>Because the children here spoken of are partakers of that which is the main ground of baptizing any children whatsoever, and neither

the Parents nor the children do put in any barre to binder it.</hi> Of which the former Branch is proved; <hi>Because interest in the Covenant is the main ground of Title to Baptism, and this these children have</hi>; and that <hi>Interest in the Covenant is the ground of baptizing an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>,</hi> the Synod proves; <hi>Because in the Old Testament this was the ground of Title to Circumcision,</hi> Gen. 17.7, 9, 10, 11. <hi>to which Baptism now answer,</hi> Col. 2.11, 12 <hi>and because in</hi> Acts 2.38 39. <hi>they are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<q>That the Covenant of <hi>Abraham</hi> was the same in substance under the Law, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

So that in his judgement, Title to Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision <hi>then was,</hi> and to Baptism <hi>now is,</hi> rightly inferred from interest in the Covenant: which [the very thing here: affirmed by the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod. What then doth the Reverend Author here say? why, that which he saith, is this, <hi>That men must be duely qualified before they may be admired to covenant with the Lord and his Church for themselves and their children</hi>—and, <hi>that the Primitive Churches looked for this qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:46467:38"/>
doth not at all enervate what the Synod here saith. For, suppose men must be duely qualified before they be admitted to Covenant and Membership, doth this prove, that <hi>interest in the Covenant</hi> is not the ground of <hi>Title</hi> to the Seal? it seems not to prove it at all; and the reason is, Because this speaks not to the thing in question, but to another point. For, whether <hi>interest</hi> in the Covenant do prove right to the Seal, is one thing; and how men should be qualified <hi>afore</hi> they be admitted to Covenant, is another; and the <hi>former</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which is here affirmed by the Synod, it cannot be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown by what the Reverend Author affirmeth concerning the <hi>latter,</hi> except we shall say, that a thing may be sufficiently confuted by speaking to another point, when one doth not speak <hi>ad idem.</hi> Whether the Parents of the children here spoken of, be <hi>duely qualified</hi> for Covenant, and unto Membership, is not the thing here in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, nor spoken of by the Synod; but here is the thing they affirm, that <hi>Interest in the Covenant gives Title to Baptism</hi>— Besides, suppose the qualifications here mentioned by the Reverend Author, of being <hi>"S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> birth; and therefore this also is another Reason, why that which is here spoken by the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Author is beside the question.</p>
                  <p>Further, whereas the Synod here addeth, <hi>That a Member, or one in Covenant as such, is the Subject of Baptism, was further cleared in</hi> Propos. 1.</p>
                  <p>The Reverend Author answereth,
<q>That the light which that Proposition holdeth forth for clearing this, is in one clause, which is here omitted, <hi>viz. [According to Scripture]</hi> They that according to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture are Members of the visible Church, are the Subjects of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Then let that clause be here added, which was there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed by the Synod in that first Proposition: if then the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Author do consent thereto, as it may seem by his
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:46467:38"/>
manner of alledging it, that he doth; then what the Synod here affirmeth, is gained, viz. <hi>That interest in the Covenant is the ground of Title to Baptism:</hi> and indeed the Synod gave five Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for clearing of that first Proposition, which the Reverend <hi>Author</hi> doth not there meddle withall, much less remove; and therefore they still stand in force.</p>
                  <p>Only it may be observed, that whereas here he seems to consent to the Proposition, if that term [<hi>according to Scripture</hi>] be added, yet when he spake to that first Proposition, he consented not thereto, unless this term [<hi>according to Scripture</hi>] might be changed into this [<hi>according to Christs Ordinance</hi>] otherwise he could not then concur with that Proposition, and this term in it, though now it seems he doth: But whether it be expressed the one way or the other, with the term of [<hi>Members</hi> [<hi>according to Scripture</hi>] or [<hi>according to Christs Ordinance,</hi>] if it be granted that such Members are the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Baptisme, then the Doctrine of the Synod in this point is granted. As for what is here said to that Proposition, if this term [<hi>according to Scripture</hi>] be not omitted, but taken in, viz.
<q>That according to Scripture, the Covenant was differently administred in diff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent times of the Church;</q>
which different manner of administration is here, <hi>pag.</hi> 22. and in the tenth Position, which is here cited, said to be this in sum,
<q>That the Church was once in Families, or domestical; under <hi>Moses,</hi> National; and under Christ, Congregational.</q>

                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>st Proposition, or their saying that is here under debate, viz. <hi>That Interest in the Covenant is the main ground of title to Baptism?</hi> It seems nothing at all. For, if according to Scripture there have been different administrations of the Covenant in different times, and that the Church was heretofore <hi>Domestical,</hi> afterward <hi>National,</hi> and now <hi>Congregational</hi>; all this may be granted, and yet it may be a Truth that is here said, <hi>That Interest in the Covenant is the main ground of Title to Baptism.</hi>

                  <p>That these Children are in Covenant, the Synod saith, appears;</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Concerning the one of these Particulars, <hi>viz.</hi> of being <hi>in Covenant according to Gospel-rules,</hi> it may be granted that it is so to be understood, and that it is not to be imagined, that the Synod meant it any otherwise. But for the other particular, <hi>that the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in Covenant are only Infants or Children in minority,</hi> this is a limitation that needs further consideration, and will be spoken to afterward.</p>
                  <p>Whereas the Synod, to prove the Parents in question to be in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, alledgeth, <hi>That they were once in Covenant, and never since discovenanted; the former, because else they had not warrantably been Baptized; and the latter, because they have not in any way of God been discovenanted, cast out, or cut off from their Covenant-relation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Reverend Author in his Answer hereunto, saith,
<q>That they are discovenanted, by not performing that whereunto they were engaged by the Covenant,— for which he alledgeth <hi>Rom. 2.25.</hi>

It seems then the Covenant doth not only reach unto Children during their minority, but also when they are become adult; for else how could they when adult, be faulty in not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming that whereunto the Covenant engageth? can men be faulty for not performing Covenant-engagements, when they are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in the Covenant? this seems not possible: therefore here seems to be a conc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

them long afore be give them <hi>a bill of Divorce,</hi> as it is said in <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9.30. <hi>Many years didst thou forbear them</hi>; and therefore it may seem more rigour then the Word alloweth, to think or say, that <hi>such as were in covenant with God in their infancy or minority, are forthwith fallen out of that estate, if they do not, as soon as ever they become adult, perform what that Covenant requireth.</hi> The long-suffering of God will not allow us so to judge, unless we had more clear warrant for such judgement: Nor doth the Text alledged, viz. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2 25. prove any such thing; but when it is there said, <hi>Thy circumcision is made uncircumcision,</hi> the meaning is it shall not <hi>profit thee</hi> at all in such a state, as to eternal benefit: and so Baptism may be said in such case to be <hi>no Baptism</hi>; and Covenant, and Church-relation, to be <hi>no Covenant, no Church-relation,</hi> i. e. not to yield any such profit in that estate: But yet if such should afterward be brought to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and New-obedience, would any say, that now such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons must be circumcised again, or baptized again, as if the former, in respect of the external act, were become null? We suppose this could not be said justly, though in respect of any profit to their Souls, their Circumcision and Baptism in their former estate was <hi>as none:</hi> and so we may say their Covenant and Church relation is <hi>as none,</hi> in respect of any Spiritual saving benefit to their Souls, if they perform not what the Covenant bindes them unto; and yet it can no more be said, that in respect of their Church-relation, and external visible state, they are not in the Church, or not in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, then in the other particulars it can be said, that they are not circumcised, or not baptized. It is one thing to be <hi>in the Covenant,</hi> and <hi>in the Church,</hi> in respect of external state, and another thing to <hi>enjoy</hi> all the spiritual and eternal benefits of such a relation; and though this <hi>latter</hi> be the portion of none but such as come to be truly regenerate, yet the <hi>other</hi> is, and so continues, the right of all that have once had it, untill in some <hi>way of God</hi> they be <hi>cut off</hi> from it, and so deprived thereof.</p>
                  <p>The Synod having said, <hi>That persons once in Covenant are not bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off from it, according to Scripture, sare for notorious sins, and incorrigibleness therein, which is not the case of these Parents.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Reverend Author answereth,
<q>That if they break off them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:46467:40"/>
by breaking the Covenant which was sealed by Baptism in their infancy or minority, they thereby deprive themselves of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits and Priviledges of the Covenant, and in such case are to be looked at like those in <hi>1 Joh. 2.19.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> If by <hi>Breaking off themselves,</hi> were meant no more, but that they do this <hi>meritoriously,</hi> i. e. that by their sin they deserve to be broken off, then it may be granted, that in this sense persons <hi>may</hi> (though not that <hi>these do</hi>) <hi>break off themselves from their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-relation</hi>; and so also may persons that have been in full commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, even these by their sins may thus <hi>break off themselves,</hi> in which sense it is said, <hi>Hos.</hi> 13.9. <hi>O Israel, thou hast destroyed thy self,</hi> i. e. that their sins were the procuring or meritorious cause of their destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But if hereby be meant, that the persons spoken of do <hi>break off themselves</hi> from their Church-relation not onely meritoriously, but actually and really, then it may be justly questioned, <hi>whether Church-members can thus break off themselves.</hi> Sure Israel did not thus destroy themselves, because all judgement and punishment is from the Lord, whose work it is to <hi>kill, and make alive,</hi> to <hi>wound, and to heal,</hi> to <hi>create peace and evil</hi>; so that there is no <hi>evil in the city, but the Lord doth it, even the Lord doth all these things,</hi> Deut. 32.39. Isa. 45.7. Amos 3.6. And therefore, if <hi>breaking off</hi> from Church-estate, be an evil of Punishment, men cannot in this sense <hi>break off them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</hi> without God. Besides, men cannot of themselves alone bring in themselves into the Church, but there is requisite the <hi>Consent</hi> of the Church thereto; and therefore if they cannot, of themselves alone, bring in themselves into the Church, how is it credible that of themselves alone they should <hi>break themselves off from the Church?</hi> One would think, that such as cannot of themselves alone open the door for their <hi>Entrance</hi> into the Church, should no more be able to open it for their <hi>going out.</hi> And further, it seems not rational, that Delinquents in the Church should have it in their power, whether they will be censured with Church-censure, or no; and yet it must be so, if men that have been Church-members may <hi>un-Member themselves</hi> at their pleasure: for sure it is, Church censures cannot be dispensed to any, but to such as are <hi>within</hi> the Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.12. If therefore a Church-member, suppose one that hath been
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:46467:40"/>
in <hi>full communion,</hi> shall commit the most enormous and scandalous wickedness that can be named; yet if men may <hi>break off themselves</hi> from Church-relation at their pleasure, such an one may have it in his choice whether he will be censured, or no: for, if he can but say, <hi>I am no Member of your Church, nor will be, but do fors<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>To that of the Synod, where they say,</hi> That the Parents in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion do not put in any barre to hinder their children from Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism: and that this is plain from the words of the Proposition, where they are described to be such as understand the Doctrine of Fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </q>
                  <p>The Reverend Author in his Answer, saith
<q>That notwithstanding this, the Parents may put in a barre to hinder their children from Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>sm, because a man may do and be all that is required in that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, and yet have no faith in Christ, but be an unregenerate person—</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> It is one thing what a man <hi>may do,</hi> and yet be an <hi>unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate person</hi> really and in the sight of God, who <hi>knoweth the heart</hi>; and another thing to be <hi>visibly so</hi> in the view of men, and in their ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall judgement: for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is granted, that a man may <hi>be</hi> and <hi>do</hi> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly and visibly all that the Proposition mentioneth, yea and all that can be named further, and yet be really, and in the sight of God, an <hi>unregenerate person</hi>; but yet this needs not to hinder his childe from Baptism before the Church: for such was the case of <hi>Iudas, Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira, Simon Magus,</hi> and others, who had <hi>a name to live, and yet were dead,</hi> Rev. 3.1. and yet for all this dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and unregeneracy of theirs, the Church did <hi>warrantably</hi> admit
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:46467:42"/>
them and theirs to Baptism, because visibly, and for ought that the Church could discern, they were regenerate, sith <hi>De occultis non judicat Ecclesia.</hi> But that a man may <hi>do,</hi> and <hi>be</hi> all that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position mentioneth, and yet be <hi>unregenerate,</hi> and without Faith, not onely in the sight of God, but also visibly, and to the Churches judgement; this seems not very probable. Even one of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars which the Proposition mentioneth, viz. that of [<hi>Giving up themselves to the Lord</hi>] is spoken of by the Apostle, as a token of <hi>the grace of God bestowed on the Churches of Macedonia,</hi> 2 Cor. 8.1, 5. And when the Synod mentioneth not onely this particular<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but five or six others in the Proposition, must we for all this say, That men may <hi>do this,</hi> and all that is mentioned in that Proposition, and yet have no grace of God bestowed on them, but be, even <hi>quoad nos,</hi> without all faith in Christ, and in an unregenerate estate, and so put in a barre to hinder the Baptism of their children? we cannot but fear such judgement is more rigorous then Charity will allow; for the Scripture tells us, that <hi>the tree is known by its fruit,</hi> Mat. 12. &amp; 7. and, that even <hi>a childe is known by his doings, whether his work be pure, and whether it be right,</hi> Prov. 20.11. and therefore when there are so many things for the Parents in question, as are mentioned in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, and nothing appearing to the contrary, we think such Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, having been Members of the Church in their minority, may justly be looked at as those who <hi>do not put in any barre to hinder their children from Baptism.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Reverend Author further saith, <hi>pag.</hi> 25.
<q>Though these Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents are not Scandalous in life, but Solemnly own the covenant before the Church, wherein they give up themselves and their children to the Lord, and subject themselves to the Government of Christ in the Church, yet all these may be affirmed of many who have a form of Godliness, and deny the power thereof: from such <hi>Paul</hi> warned <hi>Timothy</hi> to Turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, <hi>2 Tim. 3.5.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> But is it credible, that those in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. could answer all that is said in this Proposition? were they not <hi>Scandalous in life,</hi> but did <hi>give up themselves to the Lord, and subject themselves to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Christ in his Church?</hi> what then means the many Scandalous sins mentioned <hi>ver.</hi> 2, 3, 4. and what was this <hi>denying the Power of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:46467:42"/>
Godliness</hi> that is charged upon them? it is most like it was such a <hi>denying</hi> as that in <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.16. where they are said <hi>to profess to know God, but by works to deny him, being abominable, disobedient, and to every good work reprobate</hi>; and if so, then they were far from answering what is said of these Parents: for, <hi>these Parents</hi> are not <hi>Scandalous in life</hi>; but those the Apostle speaks of are <hi>Scandalous, and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for wickedness:</hi> these Parents are commendable for sundry good things in them, and good duties done by them; whereas those the Apostle speaks of are not so, but <hi>disobedient,</hi> and <hi>to every good work reprobate.</hi> And when the Apostle bids <hi>Timothy, turn away from such</hi>; doth not this simply that they were Scandalous persons, and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently wicked? it is not likely that the Apostle would else have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to <hi>turn from them,</hi> sith he himself did so lovingly converse with so many sorts of men, that he might gain them to the Lord, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.19, 20, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and gives Commandment to <hi>receive the weak, Rom.</hi> 14.1. and to <hi>instruct with meekness such as oppose themselves, if God peradventure may give them Repentance,</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.25. which things do strongly argue, that those whom he Commands in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. to <hi>turn away from,</hi> were not such as are described in the Proposition, but far worse, being apparently and grosly wicked. For otherwise, how could the Apostle in commanding to <hi>Turn away from them,</hi> be cleared from direct contradicting both his own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and his own Practice? But let those in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. whom he commands to <hi>Turn away from,</hi> be understood of persons grosly vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Scandalous, and then the appearance of contradiction is easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cleared, and so the Parents in question cleared from being such persons, as must be <hi>Turned away from.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So much for <hi>Defence</hi> of the first Argument.</p>
                  <p>But before the Reverend Author proceed to the next, he is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing large in suggesting, that the Elders do admit persons into Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership, who are not qualified according to what is said in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, so that if their Doctrine in this matter were right, yet it is here <hi>pag.</hi> 25, 26. frequently intimated that their Practice is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.
<q>For, <hi>saith he,</hi> they cannot prove that all adult persons whom they admit into personal and immediate Membership, are such as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position describeth: For, I demand, do they all understand the Doctrine
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:46467:43"/>
of Faith? what course do they take to know it? Are all the adult per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, whom they admit into Membership, such as the Proposition de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes? do they take a right course to know they are such? that they are not Scandalous in life, &amp;c.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> The Proposition speaks of such as were admitted in minori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and therefore what is done towards these when they are adult, is not fitly called <hi>admitting into Membership.</hi> For, as Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> saith, <hi>It is one thing to enter into the Church, (for that agreeth to such as were sometime without) another thing to speak of the Infants of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, who were never out of the Church, and so cannot be said to enter into it.</hi> Grounds and Ends, <hi>&amp;c. pag.</hi> 132, 133. and therefore it is a mistake to say or think of such Elders, as concurred with the Synod, That what is done by them towards the children of Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, being now adult, is an <hi>admitting of them into Membership,</hi> for this those children had afore they were adult, and therefore they are not now admitted into it.</p>
                  <p>But to leave this: Why should the Reverend Author suggest such a thing into the mindes of his Readers,
<q>That the Elders in their Practice do differ from their Doctrine, and teach one thing in the Synod, and in their Practice do contrary?</q>
Were it not more suitable to Love (which <hi>thinketh not evil,</hi> 1 Cor. 13. nor <hi>receiveth a reproach against ones Neighbour, Psal.</hi> 15.) to endeavour to bring such Elders, as are thus faulty (if indeed there be any) to Repentance for their sailing therein, rather then to give occasion of mis-appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions against them, by writing thus of them? It may well be called <hi>misapprehension</hi>; for there are few of the Elders, in comparison, that have yet put the children of Church-members to a publick owning of the covenant, afore the time of their admission to full communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and for those few that have done it, as this was not an admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of them into Membership, for that they had before; so it would be hard to prove, that when this was done, that their Infants might be Baptized, which is the case the Synod speaks of; it would be hard (we say) to prove that the parents, who so did, were not qualified ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the fifth Proposition describeth. And therefore to give oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of other thoughts, not only against some <hi>few</hi> of the Elders, but even of <hi>all,</hi> for what is here intimated, is not of <hi>some onely,</hi> but of <hi>all
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:46467:43"/>
alike</hi> without difference; what may be thought of this, we leave to the further consideration of the Reverend Author.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>To the second Argument of the Synod, <hi>That the children of the Parents in question, are either children of the Covenant, or strangers from the Covenant; either holy, or unclean; either within the Church, or without; either such as have God for their God, or are without God in the world: but he that considers the Proposition, will not affirm the latter concerning these children; and the former being granted, infers their right to Baptism.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this the Reverend Author answereth,
<q>That the more he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siders the Proposition, the less he findes in it to evince the former, and the more to conclude the latter.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Now the <hi>latter</hi> is, that <hi>the children of the Parents in question, are strangers from the Covenant, not holy, but unclean, and without the Church, and such as are without God in the world:</hi> And if the Reverend Author finde so much to conclude thus of the children of Church-members, which Members <hi>understand the Doctrine of Faith, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly assent thereto; are not scandalous in life,</hi> but thus and further qualified, as in the Proposition is expressed: if he finde much to conclude thus of these children, if he be had expressed any part thereof, it might have been taken into consideration; but nothing being expressed, how can it? A meer contrary Affirmation, how can it go for a sufficient Confutation?</p>
                  <p>As for that which he addeth,
<q>That if a man have no more then the Proposition holds forth, he may be a stranger from the Covenant, unclean, and without the Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q>
Is not this spoken of <hi>grown persons,</hi> and therefore how is the Synods Argument hereby touched, which speaketh of <hi>little children?</hi> Nor is it easily proved, that a <hi>grown person,</hi> who was admitted in minority, and is now qualified as the Proposition expresseth, that such a <hi>grown person</hi> is now <hi>a stranger from the Covenant, and without the Church, and without God in t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> world,</hi> and this is respect of his external state, or being in the Church-visible; we see not that this is proved at all. For, as for <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.6, 7, 8. which is here alledged, <hi>They are not all Israel, which are of Israel,</hi> &amp;c. the Text may prove, that they are not <hi>all elected of God,</hi>
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:46467:44"/>
or sincere Believers, who in regard of external relation are Members of the visible Church; and this will be easily granted: but for Membership in the Church-visible, of which is our question, that text hath nothing in it at all to prove, That men who were members of this Church in their minority, being now qualified as the Synod expresseth, that these are now <hi>without such Membership and externall state</hi>; this is not proved at all by this Text. For, if we shall so say, we shall make the Apostle to contradict himself; for, of these very persons and people, of whom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e saith, <hi>They are not all Israel,</hi> not all children, not all the children of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of these very persons and people he said, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. that <hi>they are Israelites, to whom pertaineth the Adoption, and the Glory, and the Covenants, and the giving of the Law, and the Service of God, and the Promises</hi>; that is, they were Gods adopted children in regard of external Covenant, and were Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church-visible, and yet these were not <hi>all Israel,</hi> that is, they were not all Gods Israel by election and spiritual regeneration. Thus the Apostles words are easily reconciled. But how shall they be reconciled, if the <hi>latter,</hi> as well as the <hi>former,</hi> be meant of the Church-visible? Can they <hi>be Israelites,</hi> and <hi>not Israel,</hi> in the same respect? Can they in respect of external state be partakers of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, Gods Covenant and Promises,</hi> &amp;c. and so be Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and yet in regard of the same estate, be no Church-members at all, nor in the Church-covenant at all? It is not easie to conceive how this can be; and therefore the words in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.6, 7, 8. are not fitly applied to prove that men, who were Church-members in their minority, may be qualified as the fifth Proposition expresseth, and yet now be <hi>strangers from the Covenant, and without the Church, in respect of their visible and externall state.</hi>

                  <p>Whereas the Synod for a third Argument, saith, <hi>That to deny this Proposition, would be</hi> 1. <hi>To stratten the grace of Christ in the Gospel-dispensation, and to make the Church in New-Testament-times, in worse case, relating to their children successively, then were the Iews of old.</hi> 2. <hi>To render the Iews, when they shall be called, in a worse condition then under the Legal administration: contrary to</hi> Jer. 30.20.

                  <p>To this the Reverend Author answereth,
<q>That the contrary to all and every one of these is true: for, <hi>1.</hi> It enlargeth the grace of Christ in the Gospel-dispensation, by shewing that Christian Churches are in a more spiritual and gracious frame then the Iews of old were, under Legal dispensation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Suppose that Christian Churches be in a more <hi>spiritual and gracious frame</hi> then were the Jews under the Legal dispensation, yet if then such Parents as the Proposition describes, might have the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itiatory Seal applied to their Infants, and now may not; how can it be denied but that now the Christian Churches are in <hi>a worse case,</hi> relating to their children successively, then the Church of the Jews was? For then such Parents might have their children circumcised, but now they may not have them baptized, if this Proposition be denied.

                  <p n="2">2. Saith the Reverend Author,
<q>It declareth that the state of the Iews, when they shall be called, will be far better then it was under Legal dispensations— for under the Law their light and holiness was defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive— but when they shall be called, they shall have a farre greater measure of light and holiness then was to be found in former ages—</q>

                  <p>

how can this be, if the Parents may be qualified as is expressed, and yet may not have their children baptized? Is not this a rendring of them, in respect of their children, in a <hi>worse condition</hi> then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly?</p>
                  <p>For the third Particular, the Reverend Author answereth,
<q>That the dent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ll of the Proposition doth not deny (in sum) what the Synod saith it doth, but the contrary.</q>

                     <hi>Ans.</hi> In what the Synod here saith, there are three Particulars contained or included: 1. <hi>That the Mosaicall dispensation, and first Institution of the initiatory Seal, did appoint that Seal to be applied to such as stood regularly in the Church and Covenant.</hi> 2. <hi>That the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in question d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> to such as the Mosaicall dispensation appointed it to be applied unto.</hi> Of these Particulars, the first cannot be denied; for it is undeniably proved by the Texts alledged, <hi>viz.</hi> Gen. 17.9, 10. Joh 7.22, 23. and the third Particular is plain of it self: all the doubt therefore must be about the second, viz. <hi>Whether the children in question do regularly stand in the Church and Covenant</hi>: But for this the Synod hath given divers Proofs in their first and second Arguments; which Proofs we do not see taken off by what the Reverend Author hath said thereto.</p>
                  <p>The fourth Particular is answered by a plain deniall of what there the Synod affirmeth, viz.
<q>That to deny the Proposition, doth not break Gods Covenant, by denying the initiatory Seal to those that are in Covenant.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Yet nothing can be more plain, then that denying Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision to them that were in the Covenant, was a breaking of <hi>Gods Covenant</hi>; for it is expresly so called, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.9. 10, 14. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the children spoken of be in the Covenant, how can the deniall of Baptism to them be any other then is said? and that they are in the Covenant, the Synod gave sundry Proofs in their first and second Arguments.</p>
                  <p>So much for <hi>Defence</hi> of the third Argument.</p>
                  <p>The fourth Argument of the Synod for confirming this fifth Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, is this: <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nfederate visible Believers, though but in the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:46467:45"/>
lowest degree such, are to have their children baptized: But the Parents in question are such, at least in some degree. For,</hi> 1. <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity may observe in them sundry positive arguments for it, witness the terms of the Proposition, and nothing evident against it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this the Reverend Author answereth, by denying the <hi>minor</hi> in the Argument, and affirming the contrary to the first Reason here mentioned; viz.
<q>That all that is said in the Proposition, is no suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ground for Charity to account these Parents to be Believers in the least degree.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> But if there be sundry positive arguments for Charity thus to judge of them, and <hi>nothing</hi> evident to the contrary, as the Synod argueth; why then should we judge otherwise of them? When such Church-members, as were admitted in their minority, do <hi>understand the Doctrine of Faith, and publickly assent thereto, are not scandalous in life, but do solemnly own the Covenant, wherein they give up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. is all this nothing for Charity to go upon in accounting them Believers? no, not in the <hi>least degree?</hi> we conceive Charity wants sufficient ground to judge otherwise. See more in <hi>Defence</hi> of the first Argument.</p>
                  <p>But, saith the Reverend Author,
<q>Let them show how faith was w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> in them, and then the Church will have ground for their charitable judgement concerning their fitness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> What proof is there, that except <hi>this</hi> be done, there can be no ground for the charitable judgement that is mentioned? Sure it is, there is no mention that such a thing was performed by the Eunuch, nor required of him by <hi>Philip,</hi> Acts 8. and yet he was baptized upon Profession of his Faith in Christ, though there is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that to <hi>shew how his Faith was wrought in him,</hi> was either done by him, or required of him: and therefore we see no reason to the contrary, but that when <hi>that</hi> is done which is mentioned in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, there may be ground for Charity to account them Believers, though they come not up to what the Reverend Author requireth, of <hi>declaring how their Faith was wrought in them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Synod saith, <hi>The children of the godly, though qualified but as the persons in the Proposition, are said to be Faithfull,</hi> Tit. 1.6.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="46" facs="tcp:46467:46"/>The Reverend Author answereth,
<q>Nor are the children of the godly, qualified but as in the Proposition, said to be Faithfull in <hi>Tit. 1.</hi>
                     </q>
So his Answer is an express deniall of what the Synod here saith. But to say the children in <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. are not called <hi>Faithfull,</hi> is directly to gainsay the Text, which doth exp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>esly so call them: and that these Children that are called <hi>Faithful</hi> in <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. were qualified above what the Proposition requireth, is not proved at all. For the Text that calls them <hi>Faithful,</hi> saith no more of them, but that they are not accused of <hi>Riot,</hi> or <hi>unruly.</hi> And if this be sufficient for account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them <hi>Faithful</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> those whom the Proposition describeth may much more be so accounted; because they are not only free from <hi>Vnruliness</hi> and <hi>Riot,</hi> but partakers of sundry other good qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which do amount further.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Reverend Author answereth,
<q>That the Parents in question were indeed children of the Covenant in their infancy or minority, but if when they are adult, they do not covenant for themselves and their seed, being fitly qualified, they cannot then be fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. If they be <hi>breakers</hi> of it, then sure they are comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in it: for, how can men break the Covenant, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ch they are not in? therefore, as it is here expresly confessed, that <hi>they were children of the Covenant in their minori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>y,</hi> so the same is by Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence confessed of them being <hi>adult</hi>; for otherwise, how could they be then said to <hi>break the Covenant?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. If the Parents in question were <hi>Children of the Covenant in their Infancy and minority,</hi> as the Reverend Author acknowledgeth they were, this suits well enough with the purpose and scope of the Synod in this place, which is expresly said to be this, that <hi>such children have frequently the beginnings of grace wrought in them in their younger years</hi>; and such as had grace begun in them in their <hi>younger years,</hi>
                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:46467:46"/>
why should not charity think it is <hi>there still,</hi> when nothing appears to the contrary? for he that once begins that good work of grace, is not wont to <hi>forsake that work</hi> of his own hands, but to <hi>perfect it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the day of Christ,</hi> Psal. 138.8. Phil. 1.6.</p>
                  <p>Further, saith the Reverend Author,
<q>This Argument is fall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, because it argues from some particulars, to infer a general af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatively. Some children of the Covenant have had the beginnings of grace wrought in them in their younger years, therefore all persons of this sort, &amp;c.</q>
If the Reverend Author had expressed the Synods Argument as they expressed it, it would not then have appeared so <hi>fallacious,</hi> as the alteration of their words may make it.</p>
                  <p>For, whereas they said, <hi>Children of the Covenant have frequently the beginnings of grace wrought in them in their younger years,</hi> for which they produced eight or nine Instances from Scripture: all these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, and that <hi>frequency,</hi> for Proof of which they were alledged; are now all left out, and in stead thereof it is rendred <hi>some Children of the Covenant, &amp;c.</hi> and whereas the inference which the Synod makes is thus expressed, viz. <hi>hence this sort of Persons</hi> &amp;c. now the term <hi>All,</hi> which was not in before, is expresly put in thus, <hi>All Persons of this sort,</hi> &amp;c. which alteration may indeed obscure the strength of the Argument.

<q>If Children of the Covenant have frequently the beginnings of grace wrought in them in their younger years, then this sort of Persons shewing nothing to the contrary, are in charity, or to ecclesiastical repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, visible Believers: But so it is. Ergo.</q>
The Assumption here is manifestly proved by those many Instances in Scripture alledged and by Experience; and the Consequence we hope is not <hi>fall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Reverend Author Answereth,
<q>That both the Assertion and the Proof of it are to be denyed. The Assertion is not true, that the Parents in question are regularly in the Church: Infants, and Children in minority of confederate believers, are in the Church by their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents Covenanting for them, <hi>1 Cor. 7.14.</hi> But Parents are not so, till &amp;c.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> It is here again confessed, that <hi>Infants</hi> and <hi>Children in mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> are regularly in the Church, but not so when they are adult and come to be Parents: but of their continuing in the Church, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding their coming to be adult, something hath been said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and more may in the sixth Argument, <hi>Partic.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>But whereas it is said, "<hi>The Proof is to be denied, and is not apposite:</hi> we conceive, it cannot be denied to be very apposite for the purpose for which the Synod doth alledge it, which is to p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Whether the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in question be such, or no; regularly in the Church, and so Saints, or not, is another thing, for which we conceive much hath and may be said: but the Texts alledged were not produced by the Synod for that purpose, and therefore though they be not plain for Proof of that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet if they be plain and apt enough for the purpose for which they were produced by the Synod, that may s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="5">5. Saith the Synod, <hi>Being in Covenant and baptized, they have Faith and Repentance indefinitely given to them in the Promise, and sealed up in Baptism,</hi> Deut. 30.6. <hi>which continues valid, and so a valid Testimony for them, while they do not rej<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ct it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this the Reverend Author in his Answer makes mention of a distinction
<q>Between the grace of the Covenant, and the Covenant of Grace, in regard of externall means; between the Elect, in whom God works the Grace promised in the Covenant so powerfully, that they shall not reject it, and the rest who have the outward means of grace till they reject them, as did <hi>Esau— and concludes, that</hi> Such as reject
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:46467:47"/>
the offers of grace, and living under the means of grace, do remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers, cannot be said to have Faith and Repentance undefinitely given to them in the Promise.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> But is there any Proof of the contrary to what the Synod affirmeth? It seems none at all. For, when the Synod saith, <hi>The Covenant which promiseth Faith and Repentance is a valid Testimony for them, while they do not reject it</hi>; and the Reverend Author saith,
<q>That such as do reject the offers of grace, have not Faith and Repentance given to them in the Promise:</q>
These are not contrary, nor at all inconsistent. For the Synod never said nor meant, that the grace of Faith and Repentance are given by the Covenant to them that are <hi>breakers of the Covenant, and reject the offers of grace, and living under the means of grace, do still remain unbelievers</hi>: the Synod never said, that the grace of Faith and Repentance are given to these by the Promise; but by that word, <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> they do not reject it,</hi> do plainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the contrary. And therefore what the Synod here saith, may be sound and good, for all that the Reverend Author alledgeth. If their Doctrine here be not right, then it must be said, that <hi>the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> in which God promiseth <hi>to circumcise the hearts of his people, and of their seed,</hi> Deut. 30.6. is no Promise that God will give them Faith and Repentance, nor any valid Testimony for them that he will do it, though they for their parts do not reject it. And we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose none will say this. What may be said of them, who when adult, are <hi>Breakers</hi> of the Covenant, and do <hi>reject</hi> the offers of grace, is one thing; and what may be hoped and said of them who do not <hi>so reject,</hi> is another. The Synod speaks of these <hi>latter,</hi> and the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Author of the <hi>former</hi>; and therefore the one cannot overthrow the other.</p>
                  <p>The Synod concludes this fourth Argument, by adding as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; viz. <hi>Yet it doth not necessarily follow, that these persons are immediately fit for the Lords Supper</hi>; the Reason rendred, is, <hi>Because though in a latitude of expression they are to be accounted Believers, or</hi> in numero fidelium, <hi>as even Infants in covenant are; yet they may want that ability to examine themselves, and that spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall exercise of faith, which is requisite to that Ordinance, as was said upon</hi> Propos. 4.</p>

                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:46467:49"/>To this the Reverend Author saith, 1.
<q>If any man speak, let him speak as the Oracles of God, <hi>1 Pet. 4.11.</hi> The New-Testament no where alloweth that latitude of expression, to call men Believers, who, &amp;c.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Though it be the duty of all, <hi>if they speak, to speak as the Oracles of God,</hi> yet it doth not follow from thence, that none may have the term <hi>Believers</hi> applied to them, except the term be found so applied in the New Testament: for then the name <hi>Trinity, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and many other, would be unlawful, as not being found in the New Testament, no nor in the Old; yet we suppose the Reverend Author would not count the use of these terms unlawful. How often doth himself use the terms of <hi>Par ratio, Personall membership, Mediate, and Immediate members,</hi> and others, and yet they are terms not found in all the Scripture: and therefore if the term <hi>Believers</hi> be not found applied in the New Testament to the persons spoken of, yet if the thing it self be found, and the matter be so delivered as becomes the <hi>Oracles of God,</hi> that is, with such reverence, purity, &amp;c. as is meet, we suppose that Rule of <hi>speaking as the Oracles of God,</hi> is not violated, though the term it self were not so used in the New Testament, nor yet in the Old. And for the thing it self, the Synod hath given four or five Arguments to prove, that the persons spoken of are <hi>visible Believers</hi>; which Arguments we do not see satisfied by what the Reverend Author saith thereto.</p>

                  <p>The Reverend Author answereth,

                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Admittance into Membership is not here spoken of at all by the Synod: for the persons spoken of, are counted by the Synod to have been in the state of Membership long afore now, even in their <hi>infancy</hi> or <hi>minority</hi>; and therefore if the <hi>want of the ability</hi> mentioned, were a just barre to such admittance, yet this concerns not the persons spoken of. But is this which is here affirmed cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and clear, that <hi>want of the ability and exercise</hi> spoken of, doth argue want of the very <hi>being</hi> of Faith? May there not be the <hi>being</hi> and <hi>truth</hi> of that grace, even there where the <hi>exercise</hi> of it is <hi>much wanting?</hi> Plain it is, that our Saviour blames his Disciples, and <hi>Peter,</hi> for the <hi>want of the exercise of faith,</hi> Mat. 8. &amp; 14. Mark 4. Luke 8.25. and yet it were hard to say, that the <hi>being</hi> of faith was now wanting in them: for then we must say, either that faith <hi>once had,</hi> may afterwards be <hi>lost and gone,</hi> or else that these Disciples before this time <hi>never had faith</hi>; neither of which, we conceive, can be said truely.

                  <p>The fifth Argument of the Synod for confirming this fifth Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is this: <hi>That the deniall of Baptism to the children in question, hath a dangerous tendency in it to Irreligion and Apostacy; because to deny them to have any part in the Lord, is the way to cause them to cease from fearing the Lord; witness</hi> Josh. 22.24, 25, 27. <hi>But to deny them, and so their children successively, to be in the Church, or Members of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, and so to have right to Baptism, is to deny them to have any part in the Lord; and therefore it tends to cause a ceasing from fearing the Lord, and so tends to Irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Apostacy.</hi>

                     <q>That Text <hi>Josh. 22.24, 25. saith the Reverend Author,</hi> speaks nothing for their advantage in this case.</q>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Let it be considered for what purpose the Synod alledgeth that Text, and then it will appear that it <hi>speaks for them.</hi> Now the purpose of the Synod in producing that text, is plainly this, <hi>that to deny such Children to have a part in the Lord, is the way to make them cease from fearing the Lord:</hi> and what can be more plainly spoken, then this is spoken in that Text? But why doth this Text speak nothing for the advantage of the Synod? The Reason that is given for this, is,
<q>Because the men there spoken of, were Members in ful<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Suppose all this be so, this seems not to weaken the intent of the Synod in producing this Text, but to strengthen it: For, if <hi>denying</hi> them that have been in full Communion to have any <hi>part in the Lord,</hi> may cause even such to <hi>cease from fearing the Lord,</hi> how much more may this be caused in them that have not yet had this full Communion? may not one think, that such as have enjoyed Communion with God in all his Ordinances, will not be so easily drawn away from <hi>fearing the Lord,</hi> as those that never had such full Communion? and yet the Reverend Author doth acknowledge this might have befallen the <hi>former,</hi> and therefore how much more may this be found in the <hi>other,</hi> of whom the Synod speaketh? which things considered, it seems plain that when it is said, <hi>that Text</hi> Josh. 22. <hi>speaks nothing for the Synods advantage in this case,</hi> that this saying will not hold.</p>
                  <p>The Synod having said, <hi>That the owning of the Children of those that successively continue in Covenant to be a part of the Church, is far from being destructive to the purity and prosperity of the Church, and Religion therein, as some conceive.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Reverend Author Answereth,
<q>That they who so conceive, have such grounds of that perswasion, as will not easily be removed, nor are so much as shaken by any thing said by the Synod.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>

                     <hi>Ans.</hi> If such a <hi>perswasion,</hi> That the children of those who continue in Covenant, are no part of the Church, be a <hi>Perswasion upon grounds that cannot be removed nor shaken</hi>; then it must follow, that the Church and the Covenant, which is the <hi>formalis ratio</hi> of the Church, comprehends not <hi>Children,</hi> but Parents onely, or grown per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons: and then the <hi>Antipoedobaptists</hi> have won the day; for by what right can Children be Baptized, if they be not in the Covenant, nor any part of the Church, though their Parents be? Sure to us it seems a well-grounded perswasion, that if the Parents be and continue in Covenant, the Children of such are part of the Church, and ought to be so owned,, and that this is no wayes <hi>destructive to the Purity and Prosperity of the Church, and Religion therein.</hi> If the Parents did not continue in the Covenant, then there might be some question, whether the Children be part of the Church: but it is plain, that the Synod speaks of <hi>the Children of those that continue in the Covenant</hi>; and if any think it to be a <hi>well-grounded perswasion,</hi> that the Parents may continue in the Covenant, and yet the Children of such Parents are no part of the Church, we confess we see no sufficient grounds for such a perswasion. For, the Reverend Author doth here confess,
<q>That it is true, that the frame of the Covenant runs to us, and to our Seed after us in their Generations, <hi>pag. 32.</hi>
                     </q>
And if this be true, is it not then true, that if the Parents <hi>continue in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> the Seed of such Parents are also <hi>part of the Church?</hi> for how can they be said to be in <hi>the Covenant,</hi> which is the constituting Form of the Church, and yet be <hi>no part of the Church,</hi> which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted thereby.</p>
                  <p>But, saith the Reverend Author,

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:46467:52"/>
was <hi>then National,</hi> and <hi>now Congregational</hi>; and though the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of the Covenant was <hi>then</hi> under many Types and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, which are now removed: and notwithstanding any other dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference that can be named, yet if there be not this difference also, that <hi>the Covenant did run to them, and their Seed in their Generations,</hi> but not <hi>to us,</hi> and <hi>our Seed</hi> in like sort; if this difference also be not asserted, we see not how it can be avoided, but even <hi>now</hi> as well as <hi>then,</hi> if the Parents <hi>continue in covenant,</hi> the Children <hi>do so</hi> also, and so are part of the Church: and so what the Synod affirmeth is gained. For it cannot be said, that though it was <hi>so then,</hi> yet it is not <hi>so now,</hi> except we shall deny what the Reverend Author confesseth to be true, that <hi>the frame of the covenant</hi> (did not onely run <hi>to them</hi> and <hi>to their Seed,</hi> but also) <hi>run<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Whereas the Synod saith, <hi>That to keep in the line, and under the influence and efficacy of this covenant of God, in the true way to the Churches glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Answer of the Reverend Author, in sum, is this,

                  </p>
                  <p>Whereto the answer is, That if the Parents be qualified as this Proposition expresseth, there is manifest <hi>influence</hi> of the Covenant upon them, though yet they be not come so far as to be fit for full communion. For, when they being admitted in minority, are now, when adult, not onely <hi>free</hi> from scandal in life, but also <hi>endowed</hi> with a competency of knowledge in <hi>the Doctrine of faith, and solemnly assent thereto, and own the Covenant, and therein give up themselves and their children to the Lord</hi>; we conceive all this doth import some
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:46467:52"/>
                     <hi>influence and efficacy</hi> of the Covenant upon them: but if for all this, they shall be <hi>disowned</hi> from having <hi>any part</hi> in the Church and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of God, how then can that be denied which the Synod here saith, <hi>That by this cutting off, and disavowing the Covenant,</hi> Sion <hi>is hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred from being an Eternall Excellency, and the joy of many generations?</hi> For, whatever joy it may be to the first generation, yet if all that follow, though qualified as the Proposition expresseth, be never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless denied to have <hi>any part in the Covenant and Church of God,</hi> till fit for full communion, we do not see how such <hi>following genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> can be any great <hi>excellency</hi> or <hi>joy</hi> at all.</p>

                     <hi>Ans.</hi> It is freely granted, that the Church of the Jews, when they shall be called and converted, shall be <hi>very holy and glorious</hi>; and yet it may be questioned, whether that Church shall have none in it, but <hi>onely elect and sincere Believers, both they and their children to the end of the world.</hi> For, when Christ shall come, <hi>the Kingdome of Heaven,</hi> that is to say, <hi>the Church,</hi> though it be compared to <hi>Virgins,</hi> in respect of much Ecclesiastical Purity, yet those <hi>Virgins</hi> are some of them <hi>foolish Virgins, that had no oyle in their vessels with their lamps,</hi> and so must have the <hi>door</hi> of the Marriage-Chamber <hi>shut against them,</hi> Matth. 25. therefore they were not <hi>all sincere Believers and elect:</hi> and therefore it may be a question, whether the Church of the Jews at that time will be so free from Hypocrites, as is said.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If these Scriptures, <hi>Isa.</hi> 60.15. <hi>&amp;</hi> 59.21. and the rest, do prove, that <hi>when the Iews shall be called,</hi> it shall be with them as is said; then what the Synod here saith is gained, and stands good, viz. That <hi>in holy, reforming, and most glorious times, there shall be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation and propagation of the Church from parents to children, from generation to generation</hi>; which is the very thing which is here af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Synod.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Though the Reverend Author do here suggest this difference between that Church of the Jews under the <hi>New Ierusalem,</hi> and the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:46467:53"/>
Gentile Churches; that these <hi>latter</hi> shall have
<q>Close Hypocrites creeping into them, and the children of Believers, by their degeneracy when adult, stopping the successive progress of the Covenant, which in the Church of the Iews shall be otherwise:</q>
yet sith the Scripture saith, that <hi>the Nations of them that are saved, shall walk in the light of that New Ierusalem,</hi> Rev. 21. and that then <hi>the Lord shall be King in all the earth</hi>; and that <hi>there shall be one Lord, and his Name one,</hi> Zech. 14. and that <hi>the Name of the New Ierusalem shall be written upon Philadelphia,</hi> a Church of the Gentiles, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. it may seem upon these considerations and the like, that there will at that time be good conformity between the Church of the Jews, and Gentile Churches, and no such disproportion or difference, that in the <hi>one</hi> there should be a <hi>continuation</hi> and <hi>propagation</hi> of the Church and Covenant from Parents and children successively, but in the <hi>other</hi> not so. We see no ground for believing such <hi>a difference,</hi> but for ought that doth yet appear, if there shall be such a glory in the <hi>one,</hi> as that there shall be a <hi>successive p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And to conceive any essential dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between either Jews or Gentiles <hi>then,</hi> and Gentiles <hi>now,</hi> as to the frame of the Covenant it self (whatever difference there may be as to the measures of grace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as is said in the Synods Result, <hi>p.</hi> 9.) is a conception that we see no ground for in Scripture.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. Be it that they are so <hi>V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>cious,</hi> or not, we think there is great reason that they should be carefully watched over by Elders of Churches, and all Superiours, that so their corruptions and sins might be mortified, and they furthered to the attainment of that saving grace of God in Christ Jesus.</p>
                  <p>And whereas the Reverend Author makes an Objection,
<q>That if they be so Vicious, they have the more need to be under the Watch, Discipline, and Government of the Church.</q>
And in Answer thereto, saith,
<q>That it cannot rationally be expected that they will submit themselves thereto, but will disregard and slight the same; and that acceptance with God, or blessing on such means cannot be expected, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God limits his Blessing to his own Appointments, <hi>p. 34, 35.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Answer is, That it hath been proved afore by seven or eight Arguments in <hi>Propos.</hi> 3. <hi>That these children are by Gods appointment under the Watch, Discipline, and Government of the Church</hi>; which Arguments have been formerly vindicated and cleared from what the Reverend Author hath said against the same: and therefore for what is here said, <hi>That the exercise of Church-discipline towards such, cannot be expected to be accepted of God, or blessed by him, because it wants his Appointment</hi>; we know not how to entertain this saying, except there were some better proof for it, which here is but naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delivered, without any proof at all: and therefore <hi>the exercise of Church-discipline</hi> towards the children spoken of, may be <hi>appointed of God, accepted of him, and blessed by him,</hi> for ought that is here said to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>And whereas it is said,
<q>That it cannot rationally be expected, that such persons will submit themselves to Church-discipline.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though we know but little of the exercise of Church-discipline towards such, yet experience doth testify, that to some it hath, by the blessing of God, been profitable, and that they have submitted to it, and been bettered by it.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, The Reverend Author did a little afore in this same Page, <hi>pag.</hi> 34. mention the <hi>Vigilancy and Faithful Care and Endeavour

of Church-Elders</hi> towards the Children mentioned, as a way or means for <hi>conveying Religion down to after-Generations,</hi> which we for our parts conceive to be sound and good.

It seems t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ese things do not well cohere:</p>
                  <p>So much for <hi>Defence</hi> of the fifth Argument, for confirming this fifth Proposition.</p>
                  <p>The sixth Argument which the Synod here useth, is, <hi>Because the Parents in question are personal, immediate, and yet-continuing Members of the Church.</hi> 1. <hi>That they are personall Members, or Members in their own persons,</hi> they say appears, 1. <hi>Because they are personally holy,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.14. 2. <hi>Are Baptized in their own persons.</hi> 3. <hi>Are personally under Discipline.</hi> 4. <hi>Are personally, by means of the Covenant, in a visible state of Salvation.</hi> 5. <hi>When they commit iniquity, they personally break the covenant,</hi> Jer. 11.2, 10. Ezek. 16. <hi>therefore they are personally in it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this the Reverend Author answereth,
<q>That three of these Proofs belong onely to infants, and the other two to adult Persons regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly admitted into Church-membership: which therefore do not concern the Parents in question: <hi>which two he saith are, 1.</hi> That they are personally under Discipline, and liable to Church-censures in their own persons. <hi>2.</hi> That when they commit iniquity, they personally break the Covenant.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Let us then consider the Particulars. For the first, <hi>that they are personally Holy,</hi> according to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. though this be meant, as the Reverend Author saith, that they are thus Holy <hi>federally</hi> and <hi>relatively,</hi> yet it is, as he acknowledgeth, in their <hi>own persons</hi>; and if so, doth it not then follow, that they are Church-members in their own persons? Can persons be truly called <hi>Holy,</hi> as in the Text al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:46467:55"/>
or <hi>an Holy seed,</hi> as <hi>Ezra</hi> 9. and yet not be Members of the visible Church? whether this holiness be <hi>inherent,</hi> or only <hi>federal</hi> and <hi>relative,</hi> yet sith they are thus Holy in their own persons, we conceive they must therefore be granted to be Church-members in their own persons. And though they first received this holiness in their minority, yet for ought we see their persons are still partakers of it, until in some way of God they be <hi>cut off</hi> from the same: which the Parents in question have not been, but being qualified as the Proposition expresseth, are far from deserving any such matter.</p>
                  <p>For the Second, <hi>That they are Baptized in their own Persons</hi>; though this be, as the Reverend Author saith,
<q>By and for their Parents Covenanting for them, they being uncapable of Covenanting for themselves; <hi>yet this being regularly done, how can it be avoided, but, as the Synod saith,</hi> It is a divine Testimony that they are in their own persons Members of the Church.</q>
For, we conceive, the Lord hath not appointed Baptism, the Seal of Membership, to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to such as are not Members: And to say, <hi>They are not Members in their own persons, but in their Parents,</hi> would infer, That they should not have been baptized in their own persons, but in their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, their Parents receiving Baptism for them; which the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Author, we are perswaded, is far from affirming. And therefore they being regularly <hi>baptized in their own persons,</hi> how can it be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided but that they are <hi>Church-members in their own persons,</hi> untill they be regularly cut off from the same?</p>
                  <p>For that other Particular, <hi>That by meanes of the Covenant they are personally in a visible state of Salvation</hi>; The Reverend Author saith nothing hereto, but onely repeats it with this addition or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation, "<hi>While nothing appears to the contrary</hi>: which clause may be added, and yet the purpose of the Synod in this Particular not at all hindred thereby. For if the persons spoken of be in their own persons in a visible state of Salvation, <hi>whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> nothing appears to the contrary</hi>; doth it not then follow, that so long they are visible Church-Members in their own persons: will any body say that they are saved in their Parents, and not in their own persons? The Synod conceived that none would so say: and that therefore it could not be said, that they are not Members in their <hi>own persons</hi> but in <hi>their
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:46467:55"/>
Parents</hi>: whereto the Reverend Author saith nothing. As for that Clause, "<hi>While nothing appears to the contrary,</hi> let the terms of the Proposition be considered, and we conceive it cannot rationally and charitably be denied, but that the persons spoken of, as they were in a state of Salvation when <hi>Infant,</hi> so they are <hi>so still</hi> for ought appears to the contrary. For the contrary cannot be evinced and evidenced against them, either by Ignorance, or Scandal, or forsaking the Covenant, or any such thing, they being such as <hi>understand the Doctrine of Faith, and publickly assent thereto, not Scandalous in life,</hi> but commendably <hi>further qualified,</hi> as is there expressed; so that for ought that appears to the contrary, they are in a visible state of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and consequently they are personally Church-members, and so herein the purpose of the Synod is gained.</p>
                  <p>For the other two Particulars, which the Reverend Author saith,
<q>Do belong to adult persons regularly admitted into Church-membership, and so do not concern the Parents in question; <hi>the one is,</hi> That they are personally under Discipline, and liable to Church-censures in their own persons.</q>
For Answer to this, he refers to his Examination of <hi>Propos.</hi> 3. and we refer the Reader to our <hi>defence</hi> of that <hi>Proposition</hi> against what he there said.</p>
                  <p>The other Particular, which is the last here mentioned, viz. <hi>That when they commit Iniquity, they personally break the Covenant</hi>; his answer to it is,
<q>That this is not proved concerning Infants, nor can be.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Suppose it cannot, yet if that be proved for which the Synod brings it, why may not that suffice, though this other be not proved, to which the Reverend Author applies it? Plain it is that the Synod neither spake nor meant this of <hi>Infants,</hi> but of such as are <hi>now Parents,</hi> and therefore past their Infancy: and therefore if these Parents, when they commit iniquity, do <hi>break the covenant,</hi> then the purpose of the Synod is gained, though such a thing could not be affirmed of Infants. But if proofs for this or that may not be accepted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are not sufficient for confirming some other things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they were neither alledged nor intended, let the judicious and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Reader consider whether this be equal and fair, and whether Arguments in such a way be sufficiently answered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:46467:56"/>For the Particular in hand the Synod argueth, <hi>That the Parents in question are personally in the covenant, because when they commit iniquity, they personally break the covenant</hi>; alledging for this, <hi>Ier.</hi> 11.2, 10. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. where <hi>breaking of covenant</hi> is expresly charged upon the persons there spoken of. Now doth not this prove the thing intended? sure, if their <hi>committing iniquity</hi> be <hi>break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of covenant,</hi> either such persons were in the covenant, or else we must say a man may be guilty of breach of covenant, when he was not in it. And that the committing iniquity by the persons spoken of, is a breaking of Covenant, the Reverend Author doth more then once acknowledge and testify, <hi>pag.</hi> 23, 28, 33, 43, 45. It were too long to transcribe all the words that are to this purpose in the Pages quoted, but, in sum, there is thus much there affirmed and taught,
<q>That the covenant in which Children are comprehended in their minority, leaves them under engagement to duty and obedience, when they become adult, which if they do not accordingly perform, they are then transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors of the Covenant, and breakers of it.</q>
Now if they be breakers of it, is it not thereby clear that they are comprehended in it? and so what is here said by the Synod stands good.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the first Particular, <hi>That the Parents in question are personal Members.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second is, <hi>That they are immediate Members, as to the Essence of Membership,</hi> (i. e. <hi>that they themselves in their own persons are the immediate Subjects of this Adjunct of Church-membership</hi>) <hi>though they come to it by means of their Parents covenanting.</hi> For Proof whereof, one thing alledged by the Synod, is that <hi>Iohn.</hi> 22.25, 27. <hi>where the children are said to have a part in the Lord, (to which Church-membership is equivalent) as well as the Parents; and nothing coming between this Subject (The Children) so as to sever it from the Adjunct (A part in the Lord)</hi> therefore they conclude, <hi>That the children are immediate Subjects of Church-membership, or immediate Members.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now what saith the Reverend Author unto this? why, that which he saith, is,
<q>That though nothing come between to sever that Adjunct from the Subject, yet something comes between to bring that Subject and Adjunct together, <hi>viz.</hi> The Parents covenanting for the childe:
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:46467:56"/>
which if it did not come between, they would be severed, as they are in othe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> But what is there in this to overthrow the Synods Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Do not they expresly grant, in terms as plain as can be spoken, and that more then once, <hi>That the children come to this Adj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nct of Church-membership by means of their Parents covenanting?</hi> See their words in their <hi>pag.</hi> 23. and therefore this can be no removing of what they have said, being nothing but the very same with that which they have said before. The question is not about <hi>the way</hi> or <hi>mean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> of childrens Membership, for it is freely yielded that in this respect it is <hi>Mediate,</hi> that is, they come unto it by means of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents covenanting; but the question is about the <hi>Ess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

Even so it is in the case in hand; the childe comes to be in Covenant, and so in the Church, by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents covenanting, yet now he is in the Church, and in the Covenant, and hath a room and place therein, as truly and as properly as the Parent.</p>
                  <p>Again, the Synod having said, <hi>That their visible ingraffing into Christ the Head, and so into the Church his Body, is sealed in Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism: and that in ingraffing, nothing comes between the graft and the stock; their union is immediate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Reverend Author answereth,
<q>That yet it will not follow that they are immediate Members of the visible Church.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> And why will not this follow? If their <hi>union</hi> with the Church be <hi>ingraffing,</hi> and that in ingraffing, <hi>nothing comes between the g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ft and the stock,</hi> doth it not then follow, that their union with the Church is <hi>immediate,</hi> and they immediate Members of it?</p>
                  <p>For, as for that which is here said,
<q>That this union is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, but metaphorically called ingraffing, because there is some simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:46467:57"/>

                     <hi>Ans.</hi> But how do they agree therein, if for all this in graffing there be something <hi>between</hi> the stock and them? Is it not a <hi>main point</hi> in ingraffing, that the union between the branch and the stock be immediate, and that nothing lye between them?

                  </p>
                  <p>As for that which is here subjoyned,
<q>That infants and children in minority do partake of Baptism and other Priviledges, by means of their Parents covenanting for them, but adult persons by their perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall covenanting for themselves and their seed.</q>
This is nothing to the <hi>Essence</hi> of their Membership, but onely speaks to the <hi>way and mean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> how they come to it, which is not the thing in question: for it may be granted, That children come to be Members by their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents covenanting for them, and the Parents by their own covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and yet their Membership, notwithstanding this different way of attaining it, may be one and the same for <hi>Essence and Kinde,</hi> and both have immediate conjunction with the Church.</p>
                  <p>For that where the Synod saith, "<hi>That in</hi> Deut. 29.11. <hi>the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were personally and immediately part of the People of God, or Members of the Church of Israel, as well as the Parents.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Answer of the Reverend Author is,
<q>That the Text doth not prove it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> And yet the words are express and plain, that <hi>they did all stand before the Lord, to enter into covenant with him, that he might establish them a people to himself</hi>; and the persons of whom this is said, are not onely the <hi>men</hi> of Israel, but also their <hi>wives,</hi> and their <hi>little ones</hi>: So that if the <hi>men</hi> of Israel, and their <hi>wives,</hi> were personally and immediately Members of that Church, their <hi>little ones,</hi> for ought that appears, were so also: for they are all alike spoken of without difference.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:46467:57"/>Whereas the Synod said, <hi>That to be in Covenant, or to be a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantee, is the</hi> formalis ratio <hi>of a Church-member; and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren being in the Covenant, are therefore the immediate Subjects of the</hi> formalis ratio <hi>of Membership, and so immediate Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Answer of the Reverend Author is,
<q>That though to be in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant be the <hi>formalis ratio</hi> of a Church-member, yet it will not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that every Covenantee doth immediately covenant for himself, nor that every Member of the Church is an immediate Member, <hi>pag. 39.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> For the one of these, viz. of <hi>Covenanting immediately for themselves,</hi> the Synod never said nor meant that <hi>little children</hi> did so covenant, nor inferred any such thing from their being in covenant, and so being partakers of the <hi>formalis ratio</hi> of Church-membership; but a little afore, and also in this very place do acknowledge, that one may come to be in covenant <hi>one way,</hi> and another <hi>in another:</hi> and therefore though children do not covenant immediately for themselves, yet what the Synod inferreth from their being partakers of the <hi>formalis ratio</hi> of Church-membership, is not at all infringed by this Branch of the Reply.</p>
                  <p>But for the other, of being <hi>Immediate Members,</hi> why doth not this follow from their being <hi>partakers of the Covenant,</hi> the <hi>formalis ratio</hi> of Membership? Can one be partaker of the <hi>Form,</hi> or <hi>forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis ratio</hi> of this or that, and yet not be immediately partaker of the <hi>Effect,</hi> or thing formed, but something must first intervene and come between? If the reasonable Soul, and its conjunction with the Body, be the <hi>formalis ratio</hi> of a man; can there be this, and yet <hi>no man imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,</hi> but something more must come between to make a man? we suppose it cannot be denied but here is a man immediately, as being partaker of the <hi>formalis ratio</hi> of a man. And even so it may be said in the present case, That children being partakers of the Covenant, the <hi>formalis ratio</hi> of Church-members, they are therefore immediate Members.</p>
                  <p>The Synod having said, <hi>That to act in covenant, is but the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall means of Membership, and yet children are not without this neither: for the act of the Parent (their publick person) is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted theirs</hi>—</p>

The sum is, they want nothing that is requisite to complea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:46467:59"/>Now what saith the Reverend Author to this? That which he saith, is this,
<q>That all that is here expressed, doth not supply what is wanting to invest little children with such membership. For, though they are in covenant, which is the <hi>formalis ratio</hi> of their member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, yet it is <hi>mediante parentum foedere,</hi> and so their membership is mediate.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> But this speaks nothing to the nature and kind of their membership, but onely to the way and means of attaining it, which may be different from that of adult persons, and yet the thing be the same. If the chief Captain obtain <hi>by a great sum to be a freeman of Rome,</hi> and Paul <hi>be free born,</hi> Act. 22.28. yet <hi>Pauls</hi> free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is either better then the other, or at least no worse; and so it may be said of the Church-membership of little children.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>There is wanting unto children in minority to make them such mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, a personal fitness to act in covenant for themselves.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> But this is nothing to the nature of their membership, but onely speaks of the way of attaining it by their own act. But shall we say that <hi>Paul</hi> wanted something to make him <hi>a free Roman,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he had no personal fitness nor ability to procure that freedome to himself by his own act, but onely was <hi>so born?</hi> or shall we say that <hi>David</hi> and others mentioned in <hi>Psal.</hi> 22.10. <hi>Isai.</hi> 46.4. wanted something of compleat, proper and immediate interest in God, because they had their interest from their <hi>mothers womb,</hi> and did not attain it by their own personal act? for our parts we dare not so say, and by like reason dare not deny, but that the interest of little children in the visible Church, may be proper, compleat and immediate, though they have not come to it by their own act, but have had it from their minority or birth. For, to have <hi>God for their God</hi> is as great a blessing, as to be an actual and immediate member of the visible Church; and yet we see want of personall fitness to act for themselves, did not hinder from the <hi>one,</hi> and why then should it hinder from the <hi>other?</hi>

This the Reverend Author doth not deny, but in plain words doth grant it: And is not then the purpose of the Synod, in alledging this instance, clearly gained? Doth it not plainly appear thereby, that a <hi>different way and means</hi> of being in Covenant, doth not make a <hi>different sort</hi> of Membership? <hi>Adam</hi> was a Member of fallen Mankinde, and so are we, though he came to be so by his own personal act, and we by him, or by his act for us? which doth clearly shew what the Synod saith, That a different way and means of being Members, doth not alter the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and kinde of Membership; which we see doth hold as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing being a Member of fallen Mankinde, and we see no reason but it may also hold as touching being a Member of a visible Church.</p>

onely for his <hi>Redeemed, the Elect.</hi> Now if Christ may be truely called <hi>a Publick Person for all his,</hi> as <hi>Adam</hi> was, though <hi>Adam</hi> was for them that were farre more in number; why may not then a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sederating Parent be counted <hi>a Publick Person for his children</hi> though they be farre less in number then the other? But herein the cases seem parallel; <hi>Adam</hi> for <hi>all in him,</hi> Christ Jesus for <hi>all in him,</hi> and the confederating Parent for <hi>all in him.</hi> We see not how this can justly be denied by the Reverend Author, si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<q>And such undertakers, that the children are bound by their Parents acting to perform that Covenant, when they shall become capable: <hi>which seems to us to be the same, or as much as is meant, when they are called</hi> Publick persons for their children.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another Similitude used by the Synod to illustrate the thing in question, is, from <hi>A Prince giving Lands to a man and his heirs successively while they continue loyall; in which case the following heir is a true and immediate Owner of that Land, and may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally disinherited, if d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>sloyall, as well as his father before him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this the Answer is,
<q>That this Similitude doth not sort the case in question; f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>r, as for infants, they cannot be visibly disl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>yall, and adult persons not regularly joyned to the Church, have cut off the entail of the Covenant from themselves and their posterity by their personall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyalty.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> But for all this, the Similitude may suit the case in question, though the Reverend Author say it doth not. For, as the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heir is an immediate Owner of that Land, till for <hi>disloyalty</hi> he be disinherited; so the following children are immediate Church-members, till some of them for their <hi>sin</hi> be cut off from their Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership. Is not here plain suitableness in the Similitude? we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it is apparent and manifest. For, if infants <hi>cannot be disl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>yal,</hi> and if adult persons be <hi>cut off for disloyalty,</hi> is it not manifest, that both are immediate owners till they be cut off? which is the thing the Synod affirms. Concerning <hi>infants,</hi> it seems they are such true and immediate owners of Church-membership, as that they cannot be <hi>cut off</hi> therefrom, because they cannot be so <hi>disloyal</hi> as to deserve such a thing: and for the <hi>adult persons,</hi> if the entaile of the covenant
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:46467:60"/>
be <hi>cut off</hi> from them and their posterity by their <hi>personal disloyalty</hi>; doth not this clearly shew, that they were truely and immediately in the Covenant, till their disloyalty <hi>cut them off</hi>? And so the Similitude stands suitable and good for the purpose for which the Synod brings it.</p>
                  <p>But as for this "<hi>cutting off the entail of the Covenant,</hi> which is here spoken of; we must confess we do not see how such a thing can justly be charged upon the persons spoken of in this Proposition: For, they <hi>understand the Doctrine of Faith, and give their Assent thereto; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>A Member</hi> (saith the Synod) <hi>is one that according to Rule, or Divine Institution, is within the visible Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>They say true, <hi>saith the Reverend Author:</hi> but that refutes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that I have said concerning Mediate and Immediate Members, for both are within the Church, though both have not full communion with the Church in all Ordinances.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> The Synod never said, that <hi>all</hi> that are <hi>within the Church</hi> have such full communion, and therefore this is nothing against them: but if <hi>all</hi> Members be within the Church <hi>according to Divine Institution,</hi> how can it be avoided but they are <hi>all immediate Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church?</hi> For, if they be <hi>all within</hi> the Church, then there is nothing as a <hi>Medium</hi> between the Church and them, or any of them, and so they are <hi>all immediate Members,</hi> as the Synod saith. Whether <hi>all have full communion,</hi> is one thing, and whether <hi>all be immediate Members,</hi> is another; and the denying of the <hi>former,</hi> is no infringing of the <hi>latter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Synod having mentioned an Objection, <hi>That if children be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and immediate Members as their Parents, they shall then imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately have all Church-priviledges as their Parents have:</hi> And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king this Answer, <hi>That it followeth not; all priviledges that belong to Members as such, do belong to the children as well as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents: but all priviledges do not so. A Member as such (or all Members) may not partake of all priviledges, but they are to make progress both in memberly duties and priviledges, as their age, capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, and qualifications do fit them for the same.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this the Reverend Author auswereth,
<q>That their Answer to the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:46467:61"/>
Objection is insufficient; for the best Members have need to make pro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress in memberly duties and qualifications, yet all have that commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that suits their membership: Infants in Baptism, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and adult persons in the Seals, Voting, <hi>&amp;c. pag. 41, 42.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> By this it seems the difference lies here, that whereas <hi>some</hi> Church-members have communion <hi>in all</hi> Church-priviledges, and <hi>others</hi> not <hi>in all,</hi> but onely <hi>in some</hi>; the Synod apprehends the reason of this difference to be, because <hi>some</hi> are yet defective in qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and fitness for such full communion, though not wanting compleat and immediate Membership: But the Reverend Author makes the reason of the difference to be from the <hi>different kinde</hi> of Membership, the one sort being onely <hi>Mediate Members,</hi> and the other <hi>Immediate. All have that communion for which they are quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> saith the Synod:
<q>All have that communion which suits their Membership, <hi>saith the Reverend Author.</hi>
                     </q>
For clearing of which Point, it may not be a miss to consider of other Societies, and how it is in them; as that of the <hi>Family,</hi> and of the <hi>Civil State:</hi> in both which it is clear, that all have not <hi>like communion</hi> in Priviledges; but who can say that this ariseth from their <hi>different Membership</hi> in the Societies of which they are? or how can it be denied, but that this ariseth from their <hi>different qualifications?</hi> An Infant, an Idiot, one Distracted, or Distempered with Frenzy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> such cannot enjoy <hi>all priviledges</hi> in the <hi>Family,</hi> or <hi>Civil State,</hi> as others may; and the reason is, Because they are not <hi>fitly qualified:</hi> but who can say they are not <hi>compleat,</hi> and <hi>proper,</hi> and <hi>immediate Members</hi> of the <hi>Family</hi> or <hi>State,</hi> as well as others? He that doth injury to such an one, doth injury to one that is as truely and properly <hi>a member of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,</hi> as those that are better qualified; and such injuries are punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with Death, or otherwise, as the nature of the offence doth require, as being injuries to one that is truely and properly a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal and immediate Subject and Member of the Common-wealth, though there might be many other Subjects better qualified? In like sort in <hi>Church-society,</hi> some may enjoy more full com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>union then others, and yet not as being more truely partakers of proper per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal, and immediate Membership, but because they are better qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="76" facs="tcp:46467:62"/>Thus of the second Particular, <hi>That the Parents in question are Immediate Members.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third is, <hi>That their Membership still continues in adult age, and ceaseth not with their infancy</hi>; 1. <hi>Because in Scripture per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are broken off onely for notorious sin, or incorrigible in peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency and unbelief, not for growing up to adult age,</hi> Rom. 11.20.</p>
                  <p>The Reverend Author answereth,
<q>That this Reason doth not prove, that the membership of all baptized in infancy continues in adult age.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Nor did the Synod so say, nor produce that Reason and Scripture for such purpose; but their purpose therein was this, <hi>viz.</hi> To prove that the Parents in question do <hi>still continue members:</hi> which may be true, though <hi>all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> are baptized in infancy do not.</hi> For thus their Argument lies: If persons be not broken off but for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious sin, or incorrigible in penitency and unbelief; then the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in question are not broken off, but do still continue members: for any such notorious sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. cannot justly be charged upon them, witness the terms of the Proposition. To this purpose is this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son alledged by the Synod; and therefore though the membership of <hi>

                     </gap> having never affirmed any such thing.</p>
                  <p>But why doth not this Reason and Text prove the thing intended by the Synod?

                  <p n="2">2. Saith the Synod, <hi>The Iews Children circumcised did not cease to be Members by growing up, but continued in the Church, and were by vertue of their membership received in Infancy, bound unto various duties, and in special to those solemn personal professions that pertained to adult Members, not as then entring into a new mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership, but as making a progress in memberly duties,</hi> Deut. 26.2—10. &amp; 16.16, 17. Gal. 5.3.</p>

<q>
                        <hi>1.</hi> That the Iewes children circumcised were bound to various duties, and to those solemn professions mentioned, is clear enough by the Texts alledged, and sundry other: whereunto I willingly adde, that Baptisme also bindeth the infant-seed of confederates to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Gospel-duties, and especially this of using all mean, &amp;c.</q>

                     <hi>now doth continue in adult age?</hi> for, when &amp; as long as one stands bound by a covenant, then and so long that covenant must needs remain in being, for otherwise how could one stand bound by it? can one be bound by that which is not in being? one would think this were not possible. Therefore by this being bound by the <hi>covenant</hi> and <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership received in infancy, to various duties</hi> when adult, it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that the covenant and membership received in infancy doth still continue in adult age, and so the purpose of the Synod is gained.</p>

                  <p>But why should we think that the Covenant in <hi>Deut.</hi> 26. was entring into a new Membership? The Reason rendred, is this;
<q>Because they entred into the Covenant personally and immediately, not in and by their Parents, as they did in infancy, <hi>Gen. 17.7.</hi> And if Covenanting be the Form of Church-membership, then a different Form of Covenanting, makes a different kinde of Membership; Mediate and Immediate Covenanting, makes Mediate and Immediate Members.</q>

                  <p>The Answer to this, is,
<q>That the one of these Texts is typical, figuring the t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>e of grace, whereby now Christ hath freed us from the servitude of Sin and Satan, &amp;c. the other Text is a Prophecy of the calling of the Elect nation of the Iews, and of the state of the Church under the New Ierusalem: and therefore these do neither of them suit the thing in question.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> But for the present nothing appears to the contrary, but
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:46467:64"/>
they may be suitable; yet, if the thing it self for which those Texts are alledged, be sound and good, the Inference which the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod makes is so also, though the Texts were not so apt. For, if the children in the Church be in state as <hi>born Servants</hi> and <hi>Subjects to Christ,</hi> then this state and relation, and so their membership, doth not cease with infancy, but continues in adult age. And we hope the Reverend Author will not deny, but for state they are as <hi>born Servants,</hi> and <hi>Subjects to Christ,</hi> though he thinks the Texts quoted are not apt Proofs for it; but if the thing be not denied, the Argument of the Synod stands good for the <hi>continuance</hi> of their membership. Grant them to be in the state of <hi>born Servants</hi> and <hi>Subjects</hi> in their infancy, and then it must be granted, that this state continueth when they are adult, and so their membership doth not cease with their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy: deny that their membership <hi>continueth</hi> when adult, and then it must be said, either that their state in infancy is not as <hi>born Servants</hi> and <hi>Subjects,</hi> or that such relations do cease with infancy. But for the Reverend Author, he expresly grants,
<q>That one special end of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership received in infancy, is to leave persons under engagement to service and subjection to Christ in his Church when grown up, when they are fittest for it, and have most need of it, <hi>pag 43.</hi>
                     </q>
which is the very same that is here affirmed by the Synod: and doth not that hence follow which the Synod inferreth, That <hi>therefore their mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership did not cease with infancy, but doth still continue?</hi> It seems to follow unavoidably: for how can they when adult, or grown up, be <hi>under engagement to service and subjection,</hi> as the end of member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship received in infancy, if that membership do not <hi>still continue,</hi> but together with their infancy be now <hi>past and gone?</hi> If they be still <hi>under engagement,</hi> then their Covenant doth <hi>still continue,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently their Membership.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Yet, when all this is done, neither can the Parents nor the Church give grace unto the children, that when they become adult they may be spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually fit for personal and immediate membership: and to bring them into it without such fitness visibly, is to prophane the Ordinances, and to pollute the Lords Sanctuary, <hi>pag 44.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> It is true, none can <hi>give grace</hi> but God, who is <hi>the God of all grace:</hi> but for <hi>bringing the adult persons</hi> spoken of <hi>into membership,</hi>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:46467:65"/>
we conceive there is no such thing here intended by the Synod, nor can be spoken of in any propriety of speech concerning the persons in question; they being such as were <hi>Members from their infancy,</hi> and are accounted by the Synod <hi>still to continue members now when adult,</hi> and therefore there is no bringing of them into membership. That which is here spoken of, were more aptly called <hi>an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging of them to be members:</hi> and how the <hi>acknowledging</hi> of such persons, as the Proposition describes, to be and continue members, can be judged <hi>a prophanation of the Ordinances,</hi> or <hi>a polluting of the Lords Sanctuary,</hi> we confess we do not understand: for we know they were brought into membership by Gods own Institution and Appointment, and we do not know that they have in any way of God been put from it; nor, considering the term in the Proposition, can be justly judged to deserve any such matter, but the contrary: and therefore the <hi>acknowledging</hi> of them to be members, can be no such <hi>prophaning and polluting,</hi> as is spoken of.</p>
                  <p>The fourth Argument of the Synod, to shew that the persons spoken of do <hi>still continue members,</hi> is this: <hi>Because there is no ordinary way of cessation of membership, but by Death, Dismis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, Excommunication, or Dissolution of the Society; none of which is the case of the persons in question.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereto the Reverend Author answereth,
<q>That the ennumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is insufficient; there is another ordinary way, <hi>i. e.</hi> Desertion. Thus <hi>Esau's</hi> membership ceased; and so many theirs, who being adult, regard not to joyn with the Church by their personal and immediate confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c. And if forsaking the Church may suffice to deprive those of Church-priviledges, who were before in personal and immediate Church-fell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>wship, <hi>1 Joh. 2.19.</hi> how much more those who never had such membership? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What can the mediate membership which such had in infancy, advantage them for continuing in membership, when being adult they live in the breach of that Covenant, whereby they were left under engagement in their infancy unto service and subjection to Christ in the Church?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> If the <hi>Ennumeration</hi> were not sufficient, but that that of <hi>Desertion</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were needful to be added, yet this would not avail to prove
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:46467:65"/>
the contrary to what the Synod here saith, but the membership of the persons in question may still continue for all this: for, being qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified as the Proposition expresseth, they are farre from being guilty of such <hi>Desertion,</hi> or <hi>forsaking of the Church of God</hi>; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not <hi>this,</hi> though it were added to the Particulars in the Argument, that can hinder their still continuing to be Members. Nor can they be justly charged as guilty of such things as are here expressed, viz.
<q>Not regarding to joyn with the Church by their personal and immediate confederation, nor to fit themselves for it, but to despise the Church of God, not desiring nor endeavouring after spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual fitness, but living in the breach of that Covenant, &amp;c.</q>
These things we cannot see how they can justly be imputed to the persons qualified as the Proposition expresseth, but they may still continue to be members, as not being culpable of any such things, as these here mentioned, to un-Member them.</p>
                  <p>Here also it may be observed, how the Reverend Author doth again acknowledge,
<q>That the sins of adult persons, who were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in infancy, are a breach of that Covenant in which they were then comprehended, and which left them under engagement unto service and subjection to Christ in the Church:</q> which sheweth that they are still in the Covenant, though now they be adult; for otherwise, how could <hi>their sins be breach of covenant?</hi> and if they be still in Covenant, then they still continue members, and their mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership did not cease with their infancy, which is the thing here af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Synod.</p>
                  <p>For that of <hi>Esau,</hi> whose membership is said to <hi>cease by Desertion</hi> the Reverend Author may remember, that he hath more then one told us of <hi>invalidity of Proofs from the Old Testaments for things <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> Gospel-times:</hi> which Proofs, though we cannot say but they may b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>valid,</hi> yet why should himself use them against us, (for this of <hi>Esau</hi> is from the Old Testament) if his apprehension be right, that <hi>such Proofs are not valid?</hi> But for the thing it self, of the <hi>cessation of membership by a mans own act,</hi> this hath been spoken unto before, <hi>pag.</hi> 34.35. in <hi>Defence</hi> of the first Argument for this fifth Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Where also was considered that Text 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.19. which is here alledged again: To which former place we refer the Reader;
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:46467:66"/>
onely adding thus much, that the <hi>cessation of membersip</hi> which the Synod here speaks of, is such cessation as is <hi>ordinary,</hi> but if <hi>Esau'</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were by his <hi>own act alone,</hi> why may we not say that there was something in it <hi>extraordinary?</hi> Though it is not any where said that it was by his <hi>own act:</hi> if any afffirm <hi>that it was,</hi> it stands upon them to prove it, for <hi>affirmanti incumbit probatie.</hi> And though it be not said that the Church had any hand in it, yet negative Arguments in matter of Fact are not cogent, though in matters of Faith they be: but for matter of Fact, we know many things <hi>were done</hi> that <hi>are not written, Ioh.</hi> 20.30. <hi>&amp;</hi> 21.25. and therefore though this be <hi>not written,</hi> that there was any Church-proceedings against <hi>Esau</hi> for his departing from the Church, and therefore we do not say there was; yet they that say <hi>there was not,</hi> must prove <hi>there was not,</hi> because the meer not mentioning that <hi>there was,</hi> is no sufficient Proof that <hi>there was not:</hi> And for any further Proof, that <hi>Esau's</hi> falling off from his Church-membership was by his <hi>own act alone;</hi> any further Proof for this, then meerly the not expressing of any Church-proceedings against him, we finde none.</p>
                  <p>The fifth Argument of the Synod for confirming this Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, That the persons spoken of do <hi>still continue Members,</hi> is this: <hi>Because otherwise a person admitted a member, and sealed by Baptism, not cast out, nor deserving so to be, may (the Church whereof he was, still remaining) become a Non-member, out of the Church, and of the unclean world; which the Scripture acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereto the answer in sum is this,
<q>That as a Freemans childe of some Corporation is free-born, and may in his minority trade under his father; yet being grown up, must personally enter into the common Engagement of Freemen, or else may not trade for himself, but is a Non-freeman by his own default, and hath lost his Freedom by not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring in his own person into the common Engagement, &amp;c. So, and much more justly, an adult person makes himself to become a Non-member by not covenanting personally as his father did.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> It may be justly questioned, whether this Comparison do suit the case in hand. For, 1. All the priviledge of this Freemans
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:46467:66"/>
childe that is mentioned, is this, that he may <hi>in his minority trade under his Father</hi>; which priviledge doth not at all arise from his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the childe of a Freeman; and the reason is, because one that is not a childe, but onely a servant of such a Freeman, may trade under the Freeman<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as his Master. This being the priviledge of such Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that their Servants, and others belonging to them, though they are not free, yet may trade for them, and in their names: which is upon then atter no priviledge at all to the childe or servant, but onely to the Freeman himself under whom they trade. But will any say, that to be a childe of a Church-member is no priviledge at all to a childe, but onely to the Father? or will any say, that the childe hath no more priviledge then the servant, sith in the cafe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, the servant may trade under the Freeman, as well as the childe may? we suppose none will say this; and therefore in this the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison doth not suit the case in hand. The Orders and Priviledges of Corporations are various, according to the tenour of their several Charters; but what the Charter of the Church is, we know, <hi>viz.</hi> That in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. it takes in <hi>children into the Church with their Parents,</hi> and doth not allow them to be put out, till censureable iniquity do appear.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If in some Corporations one that is free-born do lose his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge when he becomes adult, if he do not then enter personally into the Engagement, yet it is not certain that it is so in all. Sure no such thing is said of <hi>Paul,</hi> who yet pleads his Priviledge of being <hi>a Freeman of Rome,</hi> because he was <hi>so born,</hi> without mention of any personal act of his own for attaining that Priviledge, <hi>Acts</hi> 22. And if <hi>Paul,</hi> being <hi>free-born,</hi> did retain his Freedome when adult, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any personal act of his own for that end, why may it not be so in respect of Church-membership, though in <hi>all</hi> Civil Corporations it be not so? It is evident, that the Scripture speaks of <hi>the children of bond-servants,</hi> as <hi>bound a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>er,</hi> as <hi>free also,</hi> without mention of any act of the children to procure that relation or state, in the one case or in the other, <hi>

                        </gap>.</hi> 25.46, 54. And we see no reason but it may be so also in the visible Church, that if the Parent be a member, the childe is so also, and so continues, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p n="3">3. If it were so in all Corporations, that a Freemans childe doth <hi>lose his Freedome</hi> when adult, if he do not then in his own person en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into <hi>the common Engagement</hi>; and if it were also so in the Church, that a Members childe should <hi>lose his Membership</hi> when adult, if he do not then personally Coven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nt, (though this is more then we see proved) yet if it were so, we see not how this can be prejudicial to the persons spoken of in this fifth Proposition. For of them it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly said, <hi>that they do solemnly own the Covenant before the Church, and therein give up themselves and their children to the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> and therefore though Freedome in a Corporation, and Membership in the Church, might be lost by not <hi>entring personally</hi> into the Common Engagement, and Covenant; yet, except we shall say it may be lost, though this <hi>Personall Engagement</hi> and <hi>Entring</hi> be performed and done, except we shall say this, we cannot say that the membership of the persons in question is lost at all, but doth still continue, sith they are such as do thus personally engage and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
                  <p>As for that Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.25. <hi>If thou be a breaker of the Law, thy Circumcision is made no circumcision,</hi> which is here alledged again: we refer the Reader to what hath been said touching this Text before in <hi>pag.</hi> 33.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, whereas the Reverend Author saith,
<q>Those Texts in <hi>Rom. 11.16. 1 Cor. 7.14. Gen. 17.7.</hi> are not applicable to the adult persons in question, but onely to infants and children in minority.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Answer is, that the Synod doth not at all apply them to the adult persons in question, and therefore it is a great mistake so to think: but having said, that these <hi>persons are personall, immediate, and yet-continuing Members,</hi> they do thence infer, that their children are therefore also <hi>Members,</hi> in covenant, and holy, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are the <hi>Subjects of Baptism</hi>; which Inference and Consequence the Reverend Author we are perswaded will not deny, if the ground thereof be good, <hi>That the Parents in question are Members of the Church,</hi> as the Synod apprehends that they are. And therefore although the Texts alledged be not applicable to the adult persons in question, yet if they be applicable to such <hi>infants</hi> and <hi>little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi>
                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:46467:67"/>
whose Parents are <hi>personal, immediate, and yet-continuing Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> they do then sufficiently serve the purpose for which they are here alledged by the Synod.</p>
                  <p>So much for <hi>Defence</hi> of the sixth and last Argument for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming this fifth Proposition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Propos.</hi> 6. The sixth Proposition of the Synod, is this, <hi>Such Church-Members who either by death, or some extraordinary Providence, have been inevitably hindred from publick acting as aforesaid, yet having given the Church cause in judgement of charity to look at them as so qualified, and such, as had they been called thereunto, would have so acted, their children are to be Baptized.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this the Reverend Author Answereth,
<q>That this Proposition may not be granted, for it granteth the priviledge of Church-member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to such as are not actually and regularly Church-members.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> And yet the Proposition, in the very first words of it, doth expresly declare, that what Church-priviledge is here mentioned, is not granted to such as <hi>are not</hi> Church-members, but to such <hi>as are: Such Church-members,</hi> saith the Synod, <hi>who,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>their Children are to be Baptized.</hi> So that though Church-priviledges may not be granted to such who <hi>are not</hi> Church-members, yet to the persons here spoken of, the Baptism of their Children may be granted, without any such undue granting of Church priviledges, sith the Synod doth not say these persons <hi>are not</hi> Church-members<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but doth expresly say <hi>they are.</hi> All that can be said against these persons, is, that they have not acted according to the fifth Proposition: and yet it is said, they have been <hi>inevitably hindred</hi> therein, and <hi>have given the Church cause in judgement of charity to look at them</hi> as willing to have so acted, and therefore having been Church-members from their birth or minority, how can the applying of Baptism to their children, be the granting of a Church-priviledge to such as <hi>are not</hi> Church-members? If they had not been hindred from acting as in the fifth Proposition, but had indeed so done, yet this is not the thing that would have made them members, they having been mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers afore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and though they be now adult, yet it hath been proved afore in the fifth Proposition, <hi>Arg.</hi> 6. <hi>Part.</hi> 3. <hi>That their membership
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:46467:68"/>
doth still continue</hi>; and therefore the granting of Church-priviledges to such as are not Church-members, may be yielded to be unwarrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, without any prejudice to the persons here spoken of, or to what the Synod here saith concerning them.</p>
                  <p>And whereas the Reverend Author doth here lay down two In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences:
<q>
                        <hi>1.</hi> That an ordinary Minister cannot orderly do an act of Office to such as are not regular and actual Members of the visible Church; but, if he do, it will be usurpation. <hi>2.</hi> That the Church may not receive into any priviledge of Church-communion, such as are not actually in publick Church-order.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>These may both be granted, and yet what the Synod here saith not be at all infringed thereby. For, considering that the persons spoken of were <hi>Church-members long ago,</hi> and have never since been <hi>cut off</hi> or <hi>cast out from that Relation,</hi> nor <hi>deserve any such matter,</hi> but do <hi>still continue therein,</hi> as was shewed in the fifth Proposition, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we cannot see how it can be any <hi>usurpation in the Minister to do acts of his office towards them,</hi> nor unlawful in the Church to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them to such a priviledge of Church-communion as is spoken of; nay rather the <hi>persons being</hi> and <hi>still continuing Members,</hi> the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the thing in question may seem to be so far from being <hi>usurpation,</hi> as that the neglect thereof may be counted an unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable omission or transgression.</p>
                  <p>The first Reason of the Synod for confirming this Proposition, is, <hi>Because the main foundation of the right of the childe to priviledge remains,</hi> viz. <hi>Gods Institution, and the force of his cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant carrying it to the Generations of such as are keepers of the covenant,</hi> i. e. <hi>not visibly breakers of it, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereunto the Answer of the Reverend Author is,
<q>That the Parents of the children in question are visibly breakers of the covenant, which was sealed to them by Baptism in their Infancy, which obliged them to covenant personally for themselves and theirs, &amp;c. <hi>p. 47, 48.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> But is this certain, that the Parents in question are <hi>visibly breakers of the covenant</hi>? sure this, if it be affirmed, had need to be soundly cleared. For either they be such as do <hi>personally own the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> being qualified with <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>blameless life,</hi> &amp;c. as in the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:46467:68"/>
fifth Proposition, or else if they have not <hi>so acted,</hi> they have been <hi>inevitably hindred</hi> therein, as is said in the sixth Proposition: and is it reasonable, that for all this they must be counted <hi>visibly breakers of the Covenant?</hi> Are they such <hi>breakers of it,</hi> who do <hi>publickly own it, and therein give up themselves and their children to the Lord,</hi> being not culpable for any contrary practice in their conversation? or are they such <hi>breakers of it,</hi> who if they have not <hi>publickly acted</hi> as aforesaid, the reason hath been, because they have been <hi>inevitably hindred?</hi> we cannot see that Rule or Reason will allow or give war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for such apprehensions. Put case a person who was born a Church-member, and hath been sound in judgement, and unblame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and commendable in his conversation all his dayes, but hath been, like <hi>Ioseph,</hi> sold for a slave, and kept in bondage, suppose to the Turks, or others for many a year: suppose also that after a time he be restored to his liberty, and thereupon do return homeward with his childe or children born to him in his exile and bondage, intending to present himself and his children to the Lord in the Church where he was born, but before he reach home, he dieth by the way; this man is <hi>inevitably hindred</hi> from entring into Covenant personally, though <hi>willing to have done it,</hi> and <hi>fit for it:</hi> But will any Reason or Charity permit to count this man <hi>a visible breaker of the Covenant,</hi> because he did not personally enter thereinto? we suppose this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be said, he being <hi>inevitably hindred</hi> from so acting. Why then should the Parents in question be judged to be <hi>visibly Covenant-breakers</hi> for not entring into Covenant personally, when it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly said they have herein been <hi>inevitably hindred,</hi> though willing to have done it, if there had been opportunity? For our parts, we dare not judge them to be <hi>visibly Covenant-breakers,</hi> as not seeing any ground or warrant so to do.</p>
                  <p>The second Reason of the Synod for confirming this sixth Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, is, <hi>Because the Parents not doing what is required in the fifth Proposition, is through want of opportunity, which is not to be imputed as their guilt, so as to be a barre to the childes Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now what saith the Reverend Author unto this? Doth he deny
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:46467:69"/>
that it is <hi>want of opportunity</hi> that hinders the Parents from doing what is required in the fifth Proposition? No we do not see that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth this at all? Doth he then say, that though <hi>want of opportunity</hi> hindred, yet for all this <hi>want of opportunity,</hi> the <hi>not doing,</hi> though through <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hat want of opportunity,</hi> is nevertheless a barre to the childes Priviledge? Not so neither; we do not finde that he so saith, any more then the former: And therefore what was said in the former Reason about being <hi>inevitably hindred,</hi> may be applied to this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>for want of opportunity,</hi> viz. That such <hi>not doing what is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the fifth Proposition, can be no barre to the childes Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if the Reverend Author saith nothing touching this <hi>want of opportunity,</hi> which is the main thing which is mentioned by the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod in this their second Reason, what then doth he say in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to this Reason?</p>
                  <p>That which he first saith, is,
<q>That it hath been already proved in his Examining the fifth Proposition, That more is required to fit one that is adult for Church-membership, then is there expressed, <hi>viz.</hi> Faith in Christ made visible to the Church, without which they are not regularly Church-members.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> But the Question here is not, <hi>Whether more be required to Membership then is expressd in that Proposition</hi>; but, <hi>Whether want of opportunity in Parents to do what is there expressed, be a just barre to the childes Priviledge.</hi> It is evident that this is the question here in hand, whereto the Answer of the Synod is Negative, <hi>That this want of opportunity is not a just barre.</hi> But whether it be <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> just barre,</hi> or be not, the Reverend Author saith nothing at all to that, but speaks to another thing, <hi>That more is required to Church-membership then that Proposition doth express:</hi> so that the thing in question seems not to be touched. Yet let us a little consider of this other whereto he leads us, and return back with him to the fifth Proposition.</p>
                  <p>Concerning which, first, here seems to be a manifest mistake con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the scope of that fifth Proposition, which is not at all as is here intimated, <hi>whether what is there expressed be enough to fit one that is adult for Church-membership</hi>; but the scope of it is plainly this, to shew, <hi>That such Church-members as were admitted in minority, if
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:46467:69"/>
they be qualified as is there expressed, may have their children Baptized:</hi> but for <hi>fitness for Membership,</hi> that Proposition doth not discuss that Point at all, but expresly speaks of such as are Members <hi>already,</hi> and were <hi>admitted long ago,</hi> even <hi>in their minority.</hi> As for that which is here said concerning his <hi>Examining that fifth Proposition,</hi> we referre the Reader to what hath been formerly there said in <hi>Defence of that Proposition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Further, the Reverend Author saith,
<q>That Baptism administred by ordinary Officers to such as are out of Church-order, is profaned; as Circumcision was by the <hi>Shechemites,</hi> and would have been by the <hi>Ishmaelites</hi> and <hi>Edomites,</hi> if it had been administred to their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, when their Parents were not j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>yned to the Church, or abode not in it in the Families of <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Still this makes nothing against administring Baptism to the children spoken of in this fifth and sixth Propos. except it could be proved that their Parents are not <hi>in Church-order.</hi> For the Synod thinks, that as they <hi>were admitted into Church-membership in their minority,</hi> so they <hi>still continue therein</hi>; and the contrary we have not yet seen proved. As for the <hi>Shechemites,</hi> &amp;c. Circumcision might be <hi>profaned</hi> when administred to them, and yet <hi>Baptism</hi> not so, when administred to the children in question. For, if the <hi>former</hi> were not in the Church, yet <hi>these are:</hi> and whereas the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> were vile and vicious in their lives, these <hi>other</hi> are farre from any such thing; and therefore there is no comparison between the former, and these spoken of, but a vast difference. And we may adde further, That as there is difference between those <hi>Shechemites</hi> and the rest, and the persons spoken of, both in respect of <hi>Church-relation and Conversation</hi>; so in respect of this <hi>latter,</hi> these are farre better then sundry that abode in the Family of <hi>Iacob,</hi> to whom he will not deny but Circumcision was lawfully administred. We may instance in <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> who committed that odious Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty and Blood-shedding, for which their Father laid such a Curse upon them a little afore his death, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. And if Circumcision was lawfully administred to the children of these, they <hi>abiding in the Family of</hi> Jacob, how can Baptism lawfully be denied to the children in question, or be said to be <hi>profaned when administred to
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:46467:70"/>
them,</hi> sith they are children of Parents who were <hi>once in the Church of God,</hi> and were <hi>never cast out, nor deserving any such thing,</hi> but do <hi>still continue therein,</hi> and for life and conversation are farre from any such Scandal and Crime as was found in the Sons of <hi>Iacob</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>One end of Baptism now (as it was of Circumcision then) is, to seal Church-communion, <hi>1 Cor. 12.13.</hi> and is a testimony of the admis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the party baptized into the Family of God, The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, &amp;c.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> This is no just ground of denying Baptism to the children in question, except it could be proved that neither they nor their Parents are in <hi>the Church of God,</hi> nor of <hi>his Family,</hi> which yet we have not seen proved.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The regular and lawfull use of Baptism now (as of Circumcision of old) presupposeth both Gods Promise, and his Faith (<hi>viz.</hi> Faith for Iustification with <hi>Abraham</hi>) who is to use it, either upon himself, or upon his infant. To use it, being not so qualified visibly, is it not a treacherous usurping of the Great Seal of the King of Heaven and Earth?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Neither doth this make against the Baptism of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in question; forasmuch as their Parents and they are under <hi>the Promise of God, I will be a God to thee, and to thy seed in their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations:</hi> and the Parents being qualified as in the fifth Proposition, cannot be denied to have Faith <hi>visibly,</hi> as was shewed by the Synod in their Arguments for Confirming that Proposition, and in this <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence</hi> formerly. Sure it is, these Parents may as well be thought to have Faith <hi>visibly,</hi> as the Sons of <hi>Iacob</hi> afore-mentioned, and as many in the Church at <hi>Corinth,</hi> of whom it is said, that they were cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable for <hi>carnall Dissentions, going to Law, Fornication, Vncleannesses,</hi> and <hi>not repenting thereof,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. &amp; 3. &amp; 6. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. and yet being in the Church, and professing Christianity, we suppose the Reverend Author will not deny but their children might be baptized, and the children of <hi>Iacobs</hi> Sons circumcised, and that this in them was no <hi>treacherous usurping of the Seal of the King of Heaven and Earth</hi>; and therefore much less can such a thing be imputed to the persons qualified as in the fifth Proposition, though
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:46467:70"/>
the Seal of Baptism be administred to their children. For it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, these persons are farre from such offensiveness as was in those <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and in <hi>Reuben, Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> but are much more innocent, yea commendable.</p>
                  <p>So much for <hi>Defence</hi> of the second Reason of the Synod for confirming this sixth Proposition, against what the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Author, in his Answer thereto, saith in his <hi>Digression,</hi> and turning back to the Proposition foregoing.</p>
                  <p>The third Reason of the Synod for this sixth Proposition, is, <hi>Because God accepteth that as done in his service, to which there was a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest desire and endeavour, albeit the acting of it were hindred; as in</hi> David <hi>to build the Temple,</hi> 1 Kings 8. <hi>in</hi> Abraham <hi>to sacrifice his Son,</hi> Heb. 11.17. <hi>and in that of Alms,</hi> 2 Cor. 8.12. <hi>As in such as are said to be Martyrs</hi> in voto, <hi>and Baptized</hi> in voto, <hi>because there was no want of desire that way, though their desire was not actually accomplished.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which the Answer of the Reverend Author is,
<q>That this may hold in private service, so that there God accepts the will for the deed, when the acting of it is hindred; but in publick service, he doth not accept of that as done, which is not done, so farre as to bring them into publick state and order, whatever their desires and endeavours have been. <hi>And he instanceth in</hi> one that desireth to be a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, and yet may not do the acts of that Office, afore he be in Office; <hi>and in</hi> such as desire to joyn to the Church, but may not be received to the Seals afore they be so joyned.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereto the answer is, That what is here said is insufficient, as being not suitable to the case in hand, which is not concerning such as are <hi>out of Church-state and order,</hi> as if <hi>desires</hi> after that state were enough to bring them into it, though their actual entring were hindred. For it is evident, that the Synod speaks not <hi>of such,</hi> but of such as are <hi>Church-members already,</hi> onely have been <hi>inevitably hindred from such actings</hi> as are mentioned in the fifth Proposition; which actings are not at all spoken of for <hi>attaining</hi> Church-member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, for that state the Synod accounts that they have attained <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready</hi>: but the actings mentioned are clearly spoken of for another
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:46467:71"/>
purpose, <hi>viz.</hi> for the more orderly, clear, and edifying manner of administration of baptism to their children; themselves, though being in the state and order of Church-members, having not yet been received to the Lords Supper. It is evident, that the Synod speaks of <hi>such persons,</hi> and of actings for <hi>such an end,</hi> viz. of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons already in Church-estate, and acting for the end aforesaid; and here in this sixth Proposition of <hi>obtaining</hi> that end, though their actings, as aforesaid, have been <hi>inevitably hindred.</hi> Whereas the Reverend Author speaks of such as are <hi>not in Church-state and order at all,</hi> though they do <hi>desire it</hi>; and of them he saith, that <hi>these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires are not sufficient</hi> for their <hi>admission</hi> unto Church-priviledges, when their <hi>actual entring</hi> into Church-state is <hi>hindred</hi>: between which, and those spoken of by the Synod, there is great difference; so that if what he faith were granted, yet what is delivered by the Synod is nothing hindred thereby: but though <hi>desire of office,</hi> or of <hi>Church-estate,</hi> be not sufficient for doing the duties of the one, or obtaining the priviledges of the other, when <hi>actual entring</hi> into that office and state is <hi>hindred</hi>; yet when such as are in Church-estate <hi>already,</hi> do <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire</hi> to act as in the fifth Proposition, but are <hi>inevitably hindred</hi> from so acting, what should hinder but they may have their children Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, as if they had so acted indeed? And why may not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of Gods <hi>accepting of Abrahams offering his Son,</hi> of <hi>Davids building the Temple,</hi> and the other mentioned by the Synod, be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Proofs hereof? we see nothing to the contrary but they may. Whereto may be added that in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. where the people that <hi>prepared their hearts to seek God, are accepted of God in the Passeover, though they were not cleansed according to the purification of the Sanctuary:</hi> yet whatever it was that <hi>hindred their cleansing,</hi> their <hi>preparing their hearts</hi> did imply that they did <hi>desire it,</hi> and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon at the Prayer of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> they are accepted. And in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. when two hundred of <hi>Davids men were by faintness hindred that they could not go over the brook Besor,</hi> as he and others did, yet he will not yield but that they shall have <hi>part of the spoil,</hi> as well as others that <hi>went down to the Battell</hi>; considering that it was not want of will, but want of ability that hindred their acting as others did: and He, as he was in other things, a <hi>man after Gods own heart,</hi> even so he
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:46467:71"/>
was in this; and they that would not have had the will of these two hundred accepted, when their deed was so <hi>inevitably hindred,</hi> are called <hi>wicked men,</hi> and <hi>men of Belial.</hi> By all which the Argument of the Synod is further confirmed and cleared, when they say in this their third Reason, that <hi>God accepts that as done in his service, to which there was a manifest desire and endeavour, albeit the acting of it were hindred.</hi> And, if <hi>God accept those as Martyrs who are such onely</hi> in voto, as the Reverend Author seemeth to acknowledge, <hi>pag.</hi> 49 why may not the like be said of those who are onely Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized <hi>in voto?</hi> we see no reason but that if in the one case <hi>God accept them as Martyrs,</hi> he doth also in the other as <hi>persons Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ze<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And whereas he saith,
<q>To be Baptized <hi>in voto,</hi> will nothing ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage any, as to Church-fellowship, because <hi>de occultis non judicat Ecclesia,</hi> and things are not manifested to the Church otherwise then by congruous actings.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Answer is, 1. That the thing here spoken of by the Synod, is not at all of <hi>receiving into Church-fellowship,</hi> as the Reverend Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor carries it, but of <hi>Baptizing the Children of such as are in Church-estate already, and have been so even from their minority.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Nor is the <hi>desire</hi> they speak of so hidden and unknown, that the Church cannot judge of it, but so manifest, that they have <hi>given the Church cause in the judgement of charity to look at them as so quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> as is said, and that <hi>had they been called thereto, they would have so acted.</hi> So that if it were true, that men could not be received into Church-fellowship by <hi>meer desire</hi> of such state, when <hi>that desire</hi> is secret, and not manifest to the Church; yet men that are in Church-estate already may have their Children Baptized when their <hi>desires to act,</hi> as is mentioned, are sufficiently known to the Church, though their acting hath been <hi>inevi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ably hindred.</hi> For these cases do appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently differ; so that what the Synod saith in <hi>the one,</hi> is not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown by what the Reverend Author saith in <hi>th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> other.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is conceived by some, that those who of the Ancients are said to be Baptized <hi>in voto,</hi> were so spoken of, because they were Martyred before they could actually receive Baptism, and yet that their children were after the death of the Parents actually Baptized
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:46467:72"/>
and accounted of the Church: which if so, doth testifie, That they counted it a great matter to be Baptized <hi>in voto,</hi> sith in such case they would <hi>actually</hi> apply Baptism to the children, when the Parents had not received it <hi>actually,</hi> but onely <hi>in voto,</hi> or <hi>in desire.</hi> And how much more may Baptism be applyed to the children in question, whose Parents are not onely <hi>Baptized actually,</hi> and not in <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>sire onely,</hi> but have been <hi>actually members of the Church even from their birth or minority?</hi> onely they have not acted as in the fifth Proposition, but have been <hi>inevitably hindred therein,</hi> though they have been known to the Church to desire so to have acted.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Saith the Synod, <hi>The termes of the Proposition import that in charity, that is here done interpretatively, which is mentioned to be done in the fifth Proposition expresly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Reverend Author Answereth,
<q>Its an unwarrantable charity that makes such an interpretation, for it is without warrant of any Rule in Scripture, or in good Reason.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> But is this certain, that neither <hi>Rule in Scripture, nor good Reason, will give warrant for such charity</hi> as is mentioned? If men have been <hi>by death, or some extraordinary providence, inevitably hindred from so acting</hi> as in the fifth Proposition, and yet <hi>have given the Church cause to look at them as such as would have so acted, if they had been thereunto called, and not inevitably hindred,</hi> is there yet for all this <hi>no warrant in Scripture</hi> or <hi>good Reason for such charity</hi> as is spoken of? For our parts, when God Almighty <hi>accepts the will for the deed,</hi> when the parties inability hinders from doing so much as he would, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12. and when Scripture tells us, that <hi>Charity think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not evil, but believeth all things, hopeth all things, &amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5, 7. we cannot but think it better to retain and exercise such charity as is here spoken of, then to be driven or depart from it, as if no <hi>Rule of Scripture or good Reason would warrant it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>If that which is mentioned to be done in the fifth Proposition ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly, is here done interpretatively, both being put together, will not avail to put the Parent regularly into Church-fellowship in any sense, and to give the infant a right to Baptism thereby.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> For putting into <hi>Church-fellowship,</hi> the things here mentioned
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:46467:72"/>
by the Synod are not by them alledged for that end; and therefore if this that is said by the Reverend Author were granted, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Synod is not at all weakned thereby: But if the things mentioned be sufficient for <hi>the Baptizing of the children of Parents who are in Church-fellowship already,</hi> the purpose of the Synod is sufficiently gained.</p>
                  <p>But why do not the things mentioned <hi>avail to put the Parent into Church-fellowship?</hi> The Reason rendred, is,
<q>Because by Christs Ordinance onely adult persons, who have true Faith and Holiness, are adult Members of the invisible Church; and the same persons making profession thereof outwardly in the Order by him appointed, may be Members of the visible Church, and they onely can give their infant-seed a right unto Baptism.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> And is this certain and clear, that onely <hi>they who have true Faith and Holiness,</hi> and so are <hi>Members of the invisible Church, may be Members of the visible Church, and so their infant-seed have right to Baptism?</hi> If this were so, we may question whether it can be lawful for Ministers, or any men, to dispense Baptism to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons at all: and the reason is, Because they cannot certainly know who have such <hi>true Faith and Holiness,</hi> and so are <hi>Church-members.</hi> For what the Reverend Author said a little before in <hi>pag.</hi> 49.
<q>
                        <hi>That though God search and know the heart, yet the Church doth not,</hi> de occultis non judicat Ecclesia; this we believe to be very true: and therefore if this hold, <hi>that none may be Members of the visible Church, and give right to their seed unto Baptism,</hi> but onely they who have <hi>true Faith and Holiness,</hi> and so are <hi>Members of the Church in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible</hi>; we say, if this hold, how can we know who are to the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized, sith none can certainly know but God onely, whether men have this <hi>true Faith and Holiness</hi> in their hearts and souls?</q>
Therefore we think it more safe to say, that where there is <hi>a profession of true Faith and Holiness,</hi> and nothing contrary thereto appearing, whereby that profession can be disproved, such persons may be Members of the visible Church, and so have Baptism for their children, whether they be of the invisible Church, or no. And if the persons described in the fifth Proposition be tried by this Rule, we cannot see but as they were in <hi>Church-fellowship from their minori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
                     <pb n="98" facs="tcp:46467:73"/>
so they <hi>still continue therein,</hi> and so may have their Children bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, in as much as now they make a <hi>good profession</hi> before many wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, even <hi>the whole Church,</hi> and do no way contradict their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession by any Scandalous practice in their lives. And therefore, though that be true which the Reverend Author here saith, <hi>pag.</hi> 50.
<q>That without Faith it is impossible to please God, and that therefore there must be true Faith in them whom he priviledgeth to baptize their Infants:</q>
that is, as we understand him, whom he priviledgeth to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent their Infants to Baptism; yet for all this it may be lawful enough to administer Baptism to the Children of Parents qualified as in the fifth and sixth Propos. and they that do administer, may have <hi>Faith to please God therein,</hi> because of the Church-relation and good profession of the Parents, though the Parents <hi>cannot please God</hi> in presenting their children to that ordinance, if themselves be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute of the grace of Faith: yet this we must still say, that for any that are so qualified as is said, we see <hi>no Scripture-Rule or Reason</hi> that will <hi>warrant us</hi> to judge them so destitute.</p>
                  <p>So much for <hi>Defence</hi> of the sixth Proposition.</p>
                  <p>Propos. 7. <hi>The Members of Orthodox Churches, being sound in the Faith, and not Scandalous in life, and presenting due testimony thereof, these occasionally coming from one Church to another, may have their children baptized in the Church whither they come, by vertue of communion of Churches; But if they remove their habitation, they ought orderly to covenant and subject themselves to the government of Christ in his Church where they settle their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode, and so their Children to be baptized. In being the Churches duly to receive such unto communion, so far as they are regularly fit fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> the same.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For confirming of this Proposition in both the Parts or Branches of it, the Synod giveth sundry reasons, whereto the Reverend Author saith nothing in the particulars, but in general,
<q>That he locketh at the regular communion of approved Churches as an Ordinance of Christ:</q>
But further then so he saith nothing, either by objection against the Proposition, or by consent unto it? But all he saith is by way of propounding <hi>Quaeri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s,</hi> to the number of half a score, or more;
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:46467:73"/>
and then concludes,
<q>That when these and the like Questions are clearly Answered, he shall then understand the true and full sense of this Proposition, and what to say to it.</q>
But when the Synod shall come together to Answer these Questions, whether ever or never, we do not know, nor do see any great probability of such a thing; and therefore no more being here said against this Proposition, we may conclude that it yet stands firm and good. And, as he concludes, that <hi>Thus much may suffice, for the present, for Reply to the Synods Answer to the first Question</hi>; So may we conclude, That thus much may suffice, for the present, for <hi>Defence</hi> of the Synods Answer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst what he saith to the contrary in his <hi>Reply.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>COncerning the Reverend Author's Discourse upon the second Question touching <hi>Consociation of Churches,</hi> we shall not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Reader with any large Reply: and we hope it needeth nor, because there appeared no Dissent or Dissatisfaction in the Synod about that matter.

Besides, part of the Reverend Author's Exceptions referring to the <hi>Platform of Discipline,</hi> concluded on with great Unanimity in the Synod held at <hi>Cambridge, Anno</hi> 1648. (sundry Principal Members whereof, as Mr. <hi>Cotton, Shepard, Rogers, Norton,</hi> &amp;c. are now at rest with God) we shall not now after so many years, wherein we heard of no Opposition, make that a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Debate.</p>
                  <p>But if the Reader please to take along with him these three or four Considerations, they may serve to take off what is here Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected against us by the Reverend Author.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That we never said nor thought, that there should be <hi>a Withdrawing from other Churches upon Differences, Errours or Offences of an inferiour and dubious nature, yea though continued in.</hi> We are

farre enough from <hi>Hastiness</hi> or <hi>Harshness</hi> in that matter, being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed Adversaries to a Spirit of <hi>Sinfull and Rigid Separation:</hi> we hope there is no word in the Synods Conclusions that savoureth thereof, if candidly interpreted. And for <hi>Withdrawing from Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> because of Dissent from what is here held forth by this Synod, both our Practice and our Profession in the Preface to that Book, do sufficiently shew us to be farre from it. This may answer what is said this way in <hi>Pag.</hi> 54, 55, 57, 63.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That we account not <hi>Consociation of Churches to be another thing th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ke <hi>Consociation.</hi> Is <hi>Regular Communion</hi> so good and excellent, and can it be hurtful for Churches to <hi>agree and consent to Practise it?</hi> Neither do we mean by that <hi>Agreement,</hi> a <hi>Vow</hi> (as is suggested <hi>pag.</hi> 56, 57.) or <hi>a formall Covenant</hi> in a strict sense (though Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> doth not refuse to call it <hi>a Covenant,</hi> in <hi>Keyes,</hi> p. 54.59.) but onely <hi>a declared Consent</hi> (as is expressed <hi>Propos.</hi> 7.) <hi>of each Church to walk in Regular Communion with their Neighbour-Churches.</hi> And if the Reverend Author doth approve of the <hi>Acts of Communion</hi> here set down for the substance of them, as it seemeth he doth by what he saith <hi>pag.</hi> 52. why should it be thought a dangerous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to agree thereunto for the Substance thereof?</p>
                  <p>We have indeed found in our Experience much good and benefit by <hi>Communion of Churches,</hi> as the Reverend Author acknowledgeth, <hi>pag.</hi> 58, 61. and his acknowledgement thereof we gladly accept; but we have also found, that the want of <hi>ready Agreement</hi> timously to attend and exert the <hi>Acts of Communion,</hi> hath hazarded the Peace and Well-being of sundry Churches, and exposed them to great Troubles. We do not desire by our proposed <hi>Consociation,</hi> to adde any thing to the <hi>Communion of Churches,</hi> but onely a vigorous and timous exercise thereof.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That we expresly disclaim <hi>the subjecting of a Church unto any other Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction whatsoever,</hi> Propos. 1. and therefore it is strange that the Reverend Author should put that upon the

Consociation by us intended, <hi>That it is a subjecting of Churches un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Classicall Iurisdiction,</hi> pag. 59. It is not the bare Consent, or mutual Agreement of Churches, but <hi>the nature of the thing consented to,</hi> as, <hi>viz. The Power they agree to be stated under,</hi> that makes it a Classical Combination, or puts those Churches <hi>under a Classical Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction.</hi> What though the <hi>voluntary Combination,</hi> mentioned by by Mr. <hi>Rutherfurd,</hi> in his sense doth inferre <hi>a Classical Membership and Iurisdiction?</hi> Surely it doth not follow that ours does so, when as we expresly disclaim it. But is it true, that where-ever there is a <hi>voluntary Combination</hi> of Churches, they become a Classical or Presbyterian Church, and the Members <hi>by conse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Surely it is no new thing with Congregational-men, but their professed Doctrine, with one consent to own some kinde of <hi>Combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and Consociation of Churches</hi>; but withall we constantly afirm with Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> in the same place, that <hi>This Combination doth neither constitute any new Form of a Church, nor ought it to take away, or in any measure to diminish that Liberty and Power which Christ hath left to his Churches, but onely it serves to direct and promote the same.</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. Let the Reader please to peruse and consider the Reverend Author's <hi>Eleventh and Twelfth premised Position,</hi> pag. 6, 7, 8. and compare them with what the Synod hath published touching <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociation of Churches,</hi> and we suppose he will finde such an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between them, as that he will wonder (as we do) to see the Reverend Author appearing as an Antagonist in this matter. It seems strange, that Brethren should be willing to contend both where <hi>they do differ,</hi> and where <hi>they do not.</hi> Also it may be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, how many <hi>Reflexions</hi> here are upon us, (as if we would <hi>cast a Snare upon Churches,</hi> by straitning them in the use and exercise of their Church-power within themselves <hi>in re propria</hi>; as if we would absolutely <hi>binde Churches not to administer Censures within

                  <p>And whereas Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> is represented as being against our <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociation,</hi> pag. 60.61. Let his Printed words be viewed in the <hi>Keyes,</hi> pag. 54—59. his Solemn Speeches of it to sundry be remembred, and his Draught of it a little before his death be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, and the Reader will see whether he can joyn in belief with the Reverend Author about that matter. <hi>The Lord guide us by his Spirit into all Truth, and help us to follow the Truth in Love.</hi>
