            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE
OF THE
French Publiſher.</head>
            <p>THO the ſurpriſing Adventures
of Mr. <hi>Sadeur,</hi> and the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery</hi>
of the Country of which
you are going to read the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
be things very <hi>Extraordinary,</hi> yet
'tis ſuppoſed, the Reader will not much
ſcruple to believe them, when he ſhall be
informed, that a <hi>Southern unknown
Land</hi> has been talkt of theſe 200 Years<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
He will only wonder, that ſince the world
is now ſo well furniſhed with numbers of
ſuch skillful and curious Travellers, how it
ſhould have continued ſo long <hi>undiſcover'd,</hi>
and he will judge not without ſufficient
Grounds, that they which have attempted
<pb facs="tcp:54359:3"/>
this diſcovery, have either been <hi>Loſt in
their Voyage,</hi> or been Killed by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of the Country, after they had
entred it; as <hi>Sadeur</hi> had been himſelf, had
it not been for the ſignal he gave of a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Bravery and Courage, before the eyes
of the <hi>Auſtralians,</hi> by fighting againſt ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
of a monſtrous ſtrength and bigneſs;
which ſo charmed thoſe people, who are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
very brave themſelves, that they
granted him the priviledge to live among
them, contrary to the moſt ſolemn Laws of
their Country.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Birth of Sadeur,</hi> and his Education,
his Misfortunes and <hi>Shipwracks,</hi> will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to all the World, as effects of a Deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
that deſigned him to be born for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
purpoſe, but to be conducted afterward
into that <hi>unknown Country,</hi> of which we
had no <hi>true Relation</hi> before his time.</p>
            <p>It is true, that <hi>Magellan</hi> attributed to
himſelf the honour of having diſcovered this
Country, in the year 1520, under the name
of <hi>Terra de Fugo,</hi> or the <hi>Land of Five.</hi>
But the <hi>Hollanders</hi> have clearly convinced
us, that he diſcovered certain Iſlands that
depend rather upon <hi>America,</hi> than <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtralia.
Mark Paul</hi> the <hi>Venetian</hi> has like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
enjoyed for a conſiderable time the
<hi>Glory of this Diſcovery,</hi> becauſe that
<pb facs="tcp:54359:3"/>
being driven by a Tempeſt, a great way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the Iſland of <hi>Java,</hi> he diſcovered the
Kingdom of <hi>Maletur,</hi> the Province of
<hi>Beach,</hi> the Iſle of <hi>Petau;</hi> and another
Iſle, which he named, the <hi>Leſſer Java:</hi>
But the <hi>Hollanders</hi> which have ſince ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
themſelves in the <hi>Greater Java;</hi> and
who drive all the Commerce there, aſſure us
by all their <hi>Relations,</hi> that all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
that Pilot ſaw, are nothing but a great
cluſter of many Iſlands, that no where joyn
to the <hi>Southern Continent:</hi> and that is ſo
much the more probable, becauſe <hi>Ferdinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
Galego,</hi> having Roved all about that
Great Sea, from the Strait of <hi>Magellan,</hi>
to the Molucca Iſlands, reports that it is
ſtowed with ſuch a multitude of Iſlands,
that he counted above a thouſand.</p>
            <p>It is likewiſe true, that upon comparing
the Deſcription that <hi>Ferdinando de Quir</hi>
a <hi>Portugal,</hi> gives of the <hi>Southern Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,</hi>
with that which is contained in this
Book, it muſt needs be allowed, that he
hath made ſome Diſcovery of that Country.
For we read in his eighth <hi>Requeſt</hi> to the
<hi>King of Spain,</hi> that in the Diſcoveries,
which he made in the year 1610, of the
Southern Country, called here <hi>Auſtralia,</hi>
he found a Country much more Fertile and
Populous than any in <hi>Europe;</hi> that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
<pb facs="tcp:54359:4"/>
were much Biger and Taller than
the <hi>Europeans;</hi> and that they lived much
longer than they. And <hi>Lewis Paes de
Morres,</hi> who was Admiral of the Fleet of
the ſaid <hi>Ferdinando,</hi> confirmed to the
Councel of <hi>Spain,</hi> the truth of <hi>Doaduir's</hi>
Relation, adding that the Air was ſo heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
in that Country, and ſo conformable to
the Temper of Man, that people there, as
freely ſlept by <hi>Moon-light,</hi> as by Day-light,
on the bare Earth, and that not only
without any incommodity, but with pleaſure;
That the Fruits there were ſo excellent and
nouriſhing, that the inhabitants ſought no
other food; that they drank a much more
pleaſtant Liquor than Wine, that they knew
not the uſe of Cloaths; and that the ſtudy
of <hi>Natural Knowledge,</hi> was there very
much Cultivated. But notwithſtanding all
that, we muſt needs grant on the other hand,
that they had but a very ſuperficial know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of that Country, and that what they
have ſaid of it, might ſerve indeed to
ſtir up the Curioſity that many had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
to know it, but could no way ſatisfie
the Appetite it had raiſed in them, with
any ſolid and particular Account.</p>
            <p>'Tis therefore to our <hi>Sadeur,</hi> whoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
here follows, that we are wholly obliged
for the Diſcovery of this before <hi>Unknown</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:54359:4"/>
               <hi>Country.</hi> And I doubt not but many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
will be ſurprized, that the name of a
man to whom the World is ſo much behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ſhould lye ſo long concealed in obſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as well as the particulars of his <hi>Rare
Diſcovery:</hi> But their ſurprize will undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly
ceaſe, when they ſhall know that the
<hi>Memoirs</hi> from which this Relation was
compoſed, were long <hi>kept private in the
Cabinet of a Late Great Miniſter of
State,</hi> from whence they could not be had
<hi>till after his Death.</hi>

ought to make a Collection, and from
thence remark all the moſt conſiderable
Inſtances, for altho I have yet no oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
to ſend them into my <hi>own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,</hi>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:54359:6"/>
nor ſee any probability of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thither, yet I believe I cannot do
better than commit them to writing, for
the frequent aſſiſtance of my Memory,
and my more particular Satisfaction.</p>
               <p>I receiv'd a Memoir from a Father Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit
of <hi>Lisbon</hi> in <hi>Portugal,</hi> when I was at
<hi>Villa Franca,</hi> which contains an Account
of my Birth, and the <hi>Adventures of my
younger Years,</hi> as I am about to relate.</p>
               <p>My Father was called <hi>James Sadeur,</hi>
and my Mother, <hi>Willemetta Ilin,</hi> both
of them were of <hi>Chatillon</hi> upon <hi>Bar</hi> of
the juriſdiction of <hi>Rochel</hi> in <hi>Campagne,</hi>
a Province of <hi>France.</hi> My Father knew
many Secrets in Mathematicks, which
were owing more to his own Genius
than the Precepts of a Maſter; particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
he excelled in the inventions of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitating
the removal of great Bodies or
Burthens. <hi>Monſieur de Vare,</hi> who had
then ſome Intendance over Sea Affairs
being acquainted with him, brought him
to <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> and from thence to the
<hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> with promiſes which he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
perform'd to him, altho he knew
him to be ſo neceſſary for his Service:
My Mother who had followed him, preſt
him to return after 9 or 10 Months a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boed
at <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> and being imbark't,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54359:6"/>
                  <hi>April 25. 1603.</hi> ſhe brought me into the
World 15 days after they had been on
Shipboard, <hi>Monſieur de Sarre,</hi> who was
Captain of the Veſſel, was pleaſed to be
my God-father; <hi>I was Conceived in</hi> Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica
<hi>and brought forth upon the Ocean,</hi> an
infallible preſage of the miſeries which
were to attend me during my whole
Life.</p>
               <p>The Voyage was happy enough in all
the places which were eſteemed dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
even to the Coaſts of <hi>Aquitain,</hi>
where an unexpected Tempeſt ſo furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
engaged the Veſſel, that it was
caſt upon the Coaſts of <hi>Spain,</hi> and Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreckt
near the Cape of <hi>Finisterre,</hi> in the
Province of <hi>Galicia</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> with the
loſs of my Father and Mother. The <hi>ſame
Memoir,</hi> ſays, that my Mother ſeeing the
Ship let in the Water on every ſide,
lifted me out of my Cradle, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
me with an extream tenderneſs,
and abundance of Tears, ſaid, <hi>Ah my
dear Child, have I brought thee forth upon
the Waters, to ſee thee ſo ſoon ſwallowed
up by them? at leaſt I ſhall have this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation
of periſhing with thee.</hi> She had
hardly finiſh'd this complaint, when a
more impetuous Wave than any of the
former, breaking into the Veſſel, bore
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54359:7"/>
her away from my Father. In this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
every one was ſenſible that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
was more dear than the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his own Life, only my Parents,
who preferring me to themſelves, did
expoſe themſelves to the evident danger
of periſhing to preſerve me alive; the
love that my Mother had for me, made
her not forſake me, for in the lifting
me up continually with her arms above
the Waters ſhe her ſelf was at laſt choak-with
them; the Courage which my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhewed on this occaſion was alſo
very particular, for, forgetting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
inſtead of making to the Shore as
did the reſt, he came to us by the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of the Waves,</hi> and imbracing my
Mother, who yet lift me up, he drew us
juſt to the Bankſide, and ſet us upon
the Sand, but either having wholly
ſpent himſelf upon this occaſion, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
that we were Dead, he fell down
in a Swound, holding me in his Arms;
altho every one was ſufficiently perplext,
yet there was none that did not conſider
this ſpectacle, and was not amazed at it,
many themſelves running to relieve us,
when it was perceived that I had yet
any motion, they took me from the
Arms of my Father, and held me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54359:7"/>
a fire, which the Inhabitants had
kindled out of compaſſion to us. There
was no ſign of life in my Mother, and
having laid her for ſome time before the
fire, they were perſwaded that ſhe had
more need of a Burial.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who had more particularly
known my Father, deplored his fate
with Cries that drew Tears from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of the Countrey, <hi>O Man of
eternal memory,</hi> ſaid ſome, <hi>O too generous
ſoul, muſt thou dye for being willing to ſave
the life of thy Family? Ah,</hi> ſaid others,
<hi>never was there ſuch a Tragedy; the
Mother to expoſe her ſelf for the Child,
the Father for the Mother, and yet thoſe
generous efforts to terminate in the death
of each other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know not whether ſo much lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
made my Father ſenſible, but he
open'd his Eyes, and with a feeble and
languiſhing voice, ſaid, <hi>Where art thou
my Dear?</hi> this unexpected ſpeech ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
the Company, and when they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
him not readily enough, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<hi>Then let us all three dye together;</hi>
theſe were his laſt words, and then he
clos'd his eyes and dyed. 'Tis ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that he ſignalized himſelf on many oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
in this Voyage; but he drew the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54359:8"/>
admiration of every one in this extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity:
All thoſe who ſaw him thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
could not look upon me without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
moved with pitty, <hi>Poor deſtitute</hi>
(ſaid they) <hi>what can become of thee, can
any good fortune attend thee in this world,
thou being the cauſe of their death, who
gave thee thy life?</hi> Some believed that
I could not long ſurvive them, after the
violent ſtruglings which I had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone
in the Shipwrick.</p>
               <p>But alas! this was but the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of a Tragedy, which I have now
continued for about fifty five Years, with
ſo great and ſtrange Cataſtiophes, that
they can never be repreſented in their
whole extent, altho I my ſelf ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
them all: the heat of the fire ſoon
impower'd me to weep and lament,
with ſuch a noiſe as gave them to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
that I was out of danger.</p>
               <p>An Inhabitant of the Countrey, who
knew French enough to underſtand
what had paſt, remembred that he had
an only Son who dyed not long before,
and reſembled me, this mov'd him to
uſe his intereſt to get me; they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to <hi>Monſieur de Sacre</hi> that this was
a very favourable opportunity, and
that he could not eaſily refuſe it without
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54359:8"/>
putting me in evident danger, he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
conſented, being rather conſtrain'd
by neceſſity than any other conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
this man ſoon adapted me into
the place of his Son, and his Wife ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
heard the whole relation embrac'd
and entertain'd me with great Careſſes:
Monſieur <hi>de Sarre,</hi> and ſome others of the
moſt skilful in the Veſſel, knowing that
they were near to St. <hi>James</hi>'s, took a
reſolution of viſiting the Church which
is conſecrated to God, under the name
of this Saint, and there by good fortune
they found Merchants of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
who equip'd and gave them
opportunity of returning creditably to
<hi>Oleron. Monſieur de Sarre</hi> after his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival,
began to particularize his adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
to his Wife, and deſcribe the Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreck
which he had eſcap'd, but it was
ſome time before ſhe could attend to it,
for the joy of having received her
Husband ſafe from the danger of ſo
long and tedious a Voyage; this wholly
took her thoughts in the firſt moments
of his return: But ſome time after ſhe
prayed her Husband to give her the
<hi>Hiſtory of the Shipwreck,</hi> and then ſhe
could not forbear admiring the Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
and paternal Love of my Parents,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54359:9"/>
who for my ſake underwent a volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
death; and inſtead of conceiving an
indignation for me, ſhe took ſuch an
affection to me, eſpecially when ſhe
underſtood that her Husband was my
Godfather, that ſhe continually impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned
him to find ſome means of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaining
me; whereupon he re-imbarkt
22 Months after his return, and in 15
days arrived at <hi>Camarinas,</hi> where he
found me very well, and about 30
Months old, equally cheriſh'd by a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Mother, whom I believed to
be my Parents; as ſoon as he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
to them the reaſons of his coming,
and the deſign he had to pay for my
entertainment, proportionable to the
time that they had kept me, theſe good
People were mightily offended, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
not to part from me; <hi>Monſieur
de Sarre</hi> alledged his <hi>right of Godfather,</hi>
and the <hi>Spaniard</hi> inſiſted upon the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
and Poſſeſſion, this Cauſe was
brought before the Judges of <hi>Camarinas,</hi>
who, having decided in favour of my
Foſter Parents, <hi>Monſieur de Sarre,</hi> for
fear of having made a Voyage to his
ſhame reſolv'd to ſteal me away, and
fly under favour of the Wind which then
ſtood for him, and entring roughly into
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54359:9"/>
the houſe with a Valet where I was, and
ſeeing only one Servant-Maid which
held me, he ſnatcht me into his arms,
and gain'd the Bark which was ready
to Sail; the fear that I was in, and the
Cries that I uttered threw me into a
kind of Convulſive Swound; as ſoon as
I came to my ſelf, they found me in a
great Fevor: My foſter Father being
advertized, and juſtly provokt with
this attempt, ran with other people
towards the Forts, and perceiving
that we were out of attack, they made
a diſcharge, which gave occaſion to a
<hi>Portugueze</hi> Veſſel who lay to the South,
to diſcharge a volly of Canon upon us,
with ſuch misfortune that a Bullet broke
a Plank out of our Veſſel, juſt at the
top of the water, and ſunk her down to
rights, tho not without ſome reſpect of
being the cauſe of the death of perſons
they knew not; thoſe in the Road ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this accident made what haſte they
could away, and the <hi>Portugueze</hi> ſent
two Shalops to endeavour to ſave thoſe
which periſhed, they only preſerv'd a
Valet, who knew how to ſwim better
than the reſt, and as I floated upon the
Waters, by means of the Straw in my
Cradle, it happened that I was alſo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54359:10"/>
up: I am troubled to write
that which no body can read with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
looking upon me as a <hi>kind of Viper,</hi>
which lived by the death of thoſe who
took pains to preſerve my life; the
<hi>Portuguzes</hi> fearing a juſt reproof for
their Crime, put out ſpeedily to the
main Sea, and finding that I was yet
alive, they committed me to the care
of a <hi>Portuguze Matron,</hi> who was in their
Veſſel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhe profeſt a great deſire of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
me, till ſhe found that I was of two
<hi>Sexes,</hi> I would ſay an <hi>Hermaphrodite,</hi>
for afterward ſhe conceiv'd ſuch an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
for me, that it was a trouble
to her to look upon me, and as my
Fevor encreas'd, my death had been
inevitable without the particular care of
<hi>Monſieur de Sarre</hi>'s Valet. One might
believe that God only preſerv'd him to
cheriſh me, if I had been any way uſeful to
his ſervice. Being arrived at <hi>Leira,</hi> he
brought me from Port to Port, and
us'd me with that tenderneſs, as if I had
been his own Child; the <hi>Portugueze</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very willing to be diſcharg'd of us
for many reaſons, departed thence, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to him; and he being inform'd
that he would find more aſſiſtance in
the great Hoſpital of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> than in <hi>Leira,</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:54359:10"/>
reſolv'd to carry me thither: He was
received there with as much humanity
as if he had been in his own Countrey,
but he was ſcarce arrived when he found
himſelf ſeized with a mortal Fevor,
which carry'd him the ſeventh day, dying
in the arms of a Jeſuit, to whom he
communicated all the particulars which
I have related, and as I learn'd by means
of a Memoir which this Jeſuite <hi>gave
me 15 years</hi> after as I ſaid before. The
poor wretch dying, inſtead of regretting
his misfortune, and hating me as the cauſe
of it, ceaſt not to recommend me to
thoſe who aſſiſted him, as if I had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to him. The Father Jeſuits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
advertized of the Evils which I had
been the cauſe of till then, very ſeriouſly
deliberated what I ſhould come to, and
the reſult was, that they ſhould take a
particular Cognizance of my Inclinations,
ſo that they might know how to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
my Sex; I had hardly attained
to the age 5 years, but they were ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
that I ought to be reckoned in the
<hi>Maſouline Party.</hi> They ſaw that I had
an inclination to Devotion, and judged
that if my mind was cultivated, it
would promiſe no mean thing; they
preſented me to the Counteſs of <hi>Villa</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:54359:11"/>
                  <hi>Franca,</hi> at eight years of age, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
given her the Story of my <hi>ſad ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures.</hi>
This Lady, who might juſtly
be compared to her Illuſtrious Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors,
received me with ſo much tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
that ſhe was pleaſed that <hi>I</hi> ſhould
be treated and educated as the Count her
Son, who was about 9 years old; altho
I wore a Livery, I had no other obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
than that of keeping him compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
in his Studies, and I learn'd with
him the <hi>Latin, Greek, French</hi> and <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian
Tongues;</hi> the Principles of Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy,
Geography, Philoſophy, and
the Hiſtory of <hi>Spain,</hi> with Chronology.
The Counteſs, who ſhewed the ſame
affections to me as if I had been of her
own blood, being inform'd that I was
very ſerviceable to the progreſs of the
Count in his Studies, was willing that
I ſhould lay by the Livery, and Study
Philoſophy, and having accompliſht
that, 'twas thought fit to diſpoſe the
Count to the publick Theſes, at the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity
of <hi>Conimbria,</hi> where I was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
to harrangue, and begin the Diſpute.
Above 15 days before our departure, I
had my mind ſo agitated, that I <hi>viſibly
dryed away,</hi> ſo that my blood congealed,
as if I had been about to endure the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54359:11"/>
utmoſt puniſhment, and my heart beat
as if I had been upon the point of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Precipitated; they ſaw my Colour
come and go, but that which was moſt
afflicting in this Chain of accidents, was,
that every body believed that 'twas
only caus'd by the fear of which I had
of appearing in Publick. I ſhall ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the <hi>Dreams, Spectres,</hi> and a
thouſand ſuch things which threatened me
with extream Deſolation: So ſoon as I
had learnt that the Count was reſolv'd to
go by Sea, all the ſtory of my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
which had happened there before;
pierc'd my mind after ſo feeling a manner,
that I believed there was no mean be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
embarking and periſhing, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
then that I might travel by Land
with part of his Train, <hi>But how little
do precautions ſerve to combat againſt
Deſtiny?</hi> That what I ſought moſt
eagerly to ſhun, the Evil wherewith I
was threatned did juſtly render it ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitable;
<hi>I made ſo many adieus</hi> for
ſome hours before my departure, that
I appeared ridiculous, and the Counteſs
ſeeing me weep at her Feet, lookt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me as Weak and Effeminate. The
Count, with whom I was familiar
as with my Brother, ſaid to me, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur,</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:54359:12"/>
                  <hi>are you willing to forſake us? You
will go diſtracted, why do you thus torment
your ſelf? I believe that you have ſome
particular deſign in your mind; the fear
of appearing in publick is not capable of
working ſo much upon you as to deprive
you of common ſenſe. My Lord</hi> (ſaid I)
<hi>If it pleaſe God that I return, I will
diſcover to you the weakneſs of my mind,
but grant me the favour of ſuſpending
your judgment till we come back:</hi> This
anſwer was ſo great a ſurpriſe to the
young Lord, that he proteſted that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he would not forſake me, or
that I ſhould not go the Voyage, <hi>For
the Voyage,</hi> anſwered I, <hi>as it is for your
Honour, ſo I will accompliſh it or dye by
the way, to accompany you upon the water
if my Life lay only at the Stake I ſhould
abandon it with pleaſure, but to ſuffer
that yours ſhould be expos'd, I ſhould
rather do violence on my ſelf than obey
you.</hi> This diſcourſe joyned to the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which he had for me, made him
urge it no more to me, and ſo we part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
The day following, it is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
that <hi>Philip</hi> the II. King of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile,</hi>
having taken poſſeſſion of the
Kingdom of <hi>Portugal,</hi> in the year 1581,
he raiſed many Families to maintain
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54359:12"/>
this Illuſtrious Conqueſt with the greater
eaſe, one of theſe which he moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
was the Seignory of <hi>Villa Franca,</hi>
not without the jealouſie of many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who lookt upon themſelves to be
deſerving as that. <hi>As 'tis more eaſie to us
Conquer Nations than Hearts,</hi> many
<hi>Portugueze</hi> remained ſo firm to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
of <hi>Braggance,</hi> that they only ſought
how they might ſhake off the Yoke of
the <hi>Caſtilians,</hi> and Crown the Duke of this
Houſe: Altho the Country was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
ſubmitted to the Obedience of the
Kings of <hi>Spain;</hi> the ſecret Revolts of
particular perſons were very frequent,
and the Sea was not without its Pyrats,
who ſhewed in all the Rancounters,
what averſion they had for the <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Government, and that they could not
ſupport the Creatures of the King of
<hi>Spain.</hi> The Embarking of the Count
was blaz'd abroad, which was on the
<hi>15th</hi> day of <hi>May,</hi> in the Year 1623.
and two Veſſels Confederate of <hi>Braggance,</hi>
were reſolved to take him; to this end
they attackt two Sail which convoy'd him
towards the Coaſts of <hi>Ternais.</hi> But they
maintained their ſhock with ſuch vigour
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54359:13"/>
that the attack was to their own Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and the Glory of the Count; I
followed afar off with the Train that
went by Land, and perceived nothing
of what paſt, till ſuch time as the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
diſtinguiſhing us by the ſhining
Colours of the Count, put to Shore 30
Muſquetters, who fir'd upon us from an
Ambuſcade, killing one Page, two Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
and the Horſe upon which I was
mounted.</p>
               <p>The reſt being incapable of defending
themſelves fled away, and left me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
abandon'd to the diſcretion of theſe
Pyrats, who having brought me into
their Veſſels, put forth into the open
Sea.</p>

overcome with labour, the water at

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54359:14"/>

which was born up and began to ſwim,

with my ſelf to inſiſt no longer upon that

other fortunes he could have made in
his Voyage; I learn'd at the ſame time
that the Veſſels which we were in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to the <hi>Portugueze</hi> Merchants,
which went to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies.</hi> It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
a little time after that, the chief
Secretary of the Veſſel fell very ill,
wherefore they pray'd me to undertake
the charge.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Wind</hi> was ſo favourable that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one ſaid I brought <hi>good luck to the
Veſſel.</hi> We came well and healthful to
the <hi>Line,</hi> the <hi>15th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> and the firſt
of <hi>September</hi> to the Kingdom of <hi>Congo,</hi>
where we caſt Anchor the ſixth, at
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54359:15"/>
                  <hi>Maninga:</hi> There was no ſickneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
us, but that of the Secretary,
which encreas'd daily; the Phyſitian gave
his opinion that he ought to be ſet a
Shore, all the Captains and Pilots at the
ſame time judg'd, that he ought not to be
expoſed to double the <hi>Cape of Good Hope,</hi>
during the approaches of the Equinox.
At laſt it was reſolv'd to ſtay in this Port
till the Month of <hi>December,</hi> as well for
our Health as to avoid danger: We met
three <hi>Portugueze</hi> at <hi>Maninga,</hi> who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
the Language of the Countrey,
and who told us of ſo many <hi>Rarities in
the Kingdom,</hi> that we could not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
admire them: <hi>and was a true tereſtial
Paradice,</hi> filled with all that man could
ever deſire, for Health, Convenience, or
the Pleaſures of Life, without any need of
cultivating the Earth, which is often bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
after a thouſand labours, and always
expoſed to the rigours of bad ſeaſons.</p>
               <p>The natural inclination which I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
had to know the <hi>wonders of Nature</hi>
gave me a very <hi>ſenſible pleaſure</hi> at the
relation of them, and as I ſometimes
deſired of our Merchants to go abroad
into the Country, and examin the truth
of theſe things which were told us, ſo
I ſhall give this Abridgement of them
as follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:54359:15"/>
This Country has not half the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
in it that <hi>Portugal</hi> has; I know
not whether it may happen from the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Inclination, and the great difficulty
there is to engender: The Men there are
entirely <hi>naked,</hi> only within theſe few
years, there are ſome that begin to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
the <hi>Europeans,</hi> and cover what we
call <hi>Shameful.</hi> 'Tis certain, that the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of their Countrey renders them
negligent, ſlothful, ſimple and ſtupid;
after having conſidered them ſometimes,
I was forced to acknowledge, that Man
naturally becomes ſlothful when he has
nothing to do, and that Idleneſs trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
him to a Beaſt. The Soil of theſe
Regions, which is watered throughout
with the Rivers of <hi>Zair</hi> and <hi>Cariza,</hi>
produces Fruits in Abundance, without
any Labour, and theſe Fruits are ſo <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
and nouriſhing</hi> that they fully ſatisfie
thoſe which eat of them, even the very
Water of certain Fountains, has I know
not what delicacy and juice, which ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
thoſe that drink thereof. We ſtaid
there a conſiderable time, but without
any expenſe, becauſe the People deſpiſe
Gain, the Countrey furniſhing in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
all that one can wiſh. There's ſo
little need of Houſes in this Countrey,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54359:16"/>
that no body goes into them; and as the
Nights have all the ſweetneſs that one
can deſire; ſo 'tis better to ſleep abroad
than under a covering; they know not
how to make uſe of Beds, yet they have
their Reſerves of ſome Mattreſſes, for
the weaker ſort to lye upon, tho there is
no body that ſleeps not upon the Ground,
All theſe Conſiderations gave me an Idea
of a People, who being not obliged to
Labour, lived with ſome juſtice in the
midſt of Idleneſs, which rendred them
dull, negligent, ſleeping, diſdainful,
without Exerciſe, and without Action.</p>
               <p>Our Captain gave Liberty to me, and
three more of our Company, to go by
the River <hi>Zair,</hi> to a <hi>Lake</hi> of the ſame
Name; we had all the Pleaſure and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
poſſible in this Voyage. Take
one part of the moſt conſiderable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks
which I then made, as far as my
Memory will aſſiſt me. We arrived in
twenty four days at the mouth of the
<hi>Lake,</hi> we went about it in ten, and we
came back again to the Fleet in twenty
more; the River <hi>Zair</hi> is not rapid, and as
we had four good Oars, we could eaſily
make fifteen and eighteen Leagues a day;
nevertheleſs, 'tis certain we never made
above eight in going, whence we may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54359:16"/>
ſee how much our Geographers are
deceived, that place the <hi>Lake</hi> of <hi>Zair</hi>
three hundred Leagues from the Sea,
that which obliged us to ſuch little Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys,
was the number of Curioſities
which continually preſented themſelves
to our Eyes, in Fruits, Flowers, Fiſhes,
and tame Animals; we could ſcarce re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark
a place in the vaſt Meadows of ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and eighty Leagues long, which was
not enriched with a <hi>Marvellous Tapeſtry of
Flowers,</hi> which would paſs for rare in
the fineſt Cardens in <hi>Europe;</hi> I could
ſcarce ſee my Feet tread upon ſo many
Miracles of Nature without Indignation;
but the vaſt quantity of them was the
cauſe that they were no more eſteemed
then our Field Dazies; there is ſcarce a
Tree which does not bear ſome precious
Fruits, and ſuch as are incomparably bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than all that we know; and Nature
hath ſo accommodated them to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of the Inhabitants, that they
might be gathered without incommodety
and danger; we lived not upon any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Nouriſhment, nor did we deſire any
more: Our Maſter Pilot <hi>Sebaſtiano Deles,</hi>
a Man of great Experience, ſeeing that
we were admiring why we ſhould go to
the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> for their Delicates and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſities,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54359:17"/>
and never brought back none
of thoſe things that we ſaw in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
ſaid, That 'twas with theſe Fruits,
as with Viands, well baked and ſeaſoned,
which could not be preſerved four days
with their ordinary Guſt; this obliged me
to make the Experiment, and I ſaw that
indeed they would not be kept long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Corruption; 'tis true, that in eating
them we find 'em perfectly digeſting,
nouriſhing and conformable to the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
very different from our Fruit, and
which brings at laſt as much Indiſpoſition
to the Body, as Pleaſure to the Taſte.</p>
               <p>For this Cauſe they may be preſerved,
ſince their Crudity ſtrives with their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
heat, whereas thoſe at <hi>Manicongo</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
perfectly ripe are ſpoiled in a little time,
and as nature has provided that ſome are
always dying; ſo the Trees are always
laden with Flowers, Buds, and Fruits,
ſome green, ſome rotten, and others pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to Eat.</p>
               <p>Amongſt the great <hi>quantity of Fiſhes</hi>
which I remarkt in the River <hi>Zair,</hi> I ſaw
two ſorts which ſurprized me, I may call
the one Amphibious, ſince they are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
like our Water Spaniels, and come
as eaſily out of the Water; they leap
almoſt like Foxes, with this difference,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54359:17"/>
that their Paws are as large as the Feet of
our Drakes, and thoſe before are twice or
thrice as ſhort as thoſe behind; they have
ſo great an Inclination for a Man that
they will ſeek him out, and offer them
ſelves to him, as ſo much Sacrifice, it
happens ſometimes that they will even
leap into Boats, and come to the Feet of
the Watermen, to fawn upon them like
Dogs; this I ſaw with my Eyes, and I
wiſh not over well to a Water man that
ſtruck one of 'em down at my Feet; the
Natives of the Countrey call them <hi>Cad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeick,</hi>
and their Fleſh reſembles that of
our <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Otters.</p>
               <p>The other that I admired were <hi>ſlying
F<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſhes,</hi> and we might well call them Sea
Peacocks, but much more fine, and of a
brighter Colour, than thoſe at Land, 'tis
rarely that they ſwim at the bottom of
the Water, but they are almoſt always
ſeen at the top, their Feathers appear juſt
like the Scales of Fiſhes, but with a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity
of Green, Blew, Yellow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
ſpeckled with Red, which raviſhes the
Eyes of ſuch as behold them, theſe which
I ſaw out of the Water appeared like
great Eagles with two Wings, every one
with five or ſix Feet; one would believe
that they affected to be ſeen and admired,

ſometimes did they gather together in
a Circle round the Boat, ſometimes they
placed themſelves right againſt thoſe who
lookt upon them, turning and returning
after all manners, with Trains which
dazelled our Eyes; The Shores were full
of many ſorts of Animals, but the moſt
common, and the moſt charming, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
our Sheep at <hi>Leira,</hi> excepting
that we ſaw ſome of almoſt all Colours,
I mean, <hi>Red, Green, Yellow, and a Blew
ſo ſhining,</hi> that our Purple, and beſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
Silks come not near them; I askt
why no one traffickt in ſuch <hi>gliſtering ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities?</hi>
and 'twas anſwered that theſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Colours fail with the Lives of the
Animals.</p>
               <p>Being arrived at the <hi>Lake,</hi> we employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ten days in going round it, and we
found its length about ſixty Leagues, and
its breadth about forty; we ſaw the head
of the <hi>River Niger,</hi> which is pretty ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
and deep enough to carry a Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,
but it ſoon loſt it ſelf in the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of <hi>Benin;</hi> we reſted our ſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Nile,</hi> which is not at all inferiour
in its riſe to the <hi>Niger,</hi> and it continues
in its firſt ſtate for about three Leagues,
there is no difficulty to go down into the
<hi>Mediteranean</hi> Sea, and the Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54359:19"/>
betwixt the two Seas is alſo very
Commondious by means of this place.</p>
               <p>I carefully endeavoured to inform my
ſelf where the Crocodiles were, which
Hiſtorians place in ſuch great Numbers
in theſe Quarters, but the Inhabitants
could not even divine what I talkt of,
which made me believe they were only
Fables, if we may truly ſay, that thoſe
who make long Voyages may enlarge
upon them to others, who only know
the place of their Birth, 'tis yet more
true to Aſſertion, that this liberty is
ſtretcht too far, and often runs out into
Fictions, the reaſon is, it often happens
that Men travail a great way without
ſeeing any thing beſides Ports, or never
reſt themſelves a Moment, and all the
Miſchievous incommodities which they
ſaffer, give ſo much trouble and weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs,
that they never think of taking any
Recreation: Nevertheleſs, as Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
are perſwaded that they ought to
tell ſomething new when they come from
far, the more cunning they are, the
more capable they are of Invention, and
as there is no on which cannot contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
them, they are pleaſantly received,
and there is as certain a debt to the labour
of their Inventions, as to truth it ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:54359:20"/>
We went afterwards into a ſmall
Iſland which is in the middle of the
Lake which belongs to the King of <hi>Jaſſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

who alſo calls himſelf the King of
the Lake; the Natives of this Country,
call him <hi>Zaſſa,</hi> and the King keeps a
Fortreſs, which is lookt upon as very
famous in this Country, tho in truth
'tis very ſmall in compariſon of our
Forts in Europe; we were Charmed as
ſoon as we ſet foot upon Land, for
there was nothing wanting for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
pleaſure of all the Senſes, beſides
the order of the Aromatick Herbs,
which was a little too ſtrong; there were
Fruits ſo fine ſo delicate, and in ſo great
quantities, that the Beauty of them
joyned to the abundance, cloyed us; but
which was more ſurprizing than the
reſt, and which I had never heard of,
was a Fountain which was as ſweet as
our Hipocras, and which rejoyced and
pleaſed us more than our Spaniſh Wine,
we reaſoned loing enough upon the
cauſe, which ſhould produce ſo agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a Liquor, and we concluded that
as all over head was embalmed in this
Country, ſo the Earth within muſt be
of the ſame Nature; and if there were
Fountains of a very ill taſt, there muſt
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54359:20"/>
by conſequence be thoſe that are very
ſweet and agreeable; we drank with an
inexpreſſible pleaſure, and every one
wiſht to live in that place: There came
one of the Natives to us, and with a
great concern told us, that drinking of
that water was mortal to all ſuch as
drank to exceſs of it, we were n<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t
long in proving the truth of what he
had told us: But ſo great a drowſineſs
fell upon us, that we could not forbear
lying down in the place, where we
ſlept above 15 hours, how ever this
ſleep had no ill effect upon us, for we
roſe as brisk and healthful as we were
before; ſome attributed this ſleep to
the great quantity of Odours which
hanged over our heads, and others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
this, that this delicious drink we
had taken, was the cauſe of it. From this
Iſle we were willing to go to the Source
of the River <hi>Cuama,</hi> which we found
narrow and incapable of receiving a
Boat, a little time after, we diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Fountain of the Lake it ſelf,
and we reckoned above 200 Brooks which
came down from the Mountain, which
are over againſt the middle of it, and
which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> call Mountains of
the Moon, becauſe that <hi>Vaſco de Gama,</hi>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:54359:21"/>
who firſt doubled <hi>the Cape of Good Hope,</hi>
in the Year 1497, to diſcover the
Oriental Iſles, ſeeing the Moon,
on theſe Mountains, appear, as if it
had toucht the top of them, gave them
this name. The Natives of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
call them the Mountains of the <hi>Ors,</hi>
that is, of the Water, becauſe of the
abundance of Water which continually
runs down from them. Theſe who
confound the Lake of <hi>Zembre,</hi> with that
of <hi>Zair,</hi> ſpeak upon very defective re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
for we were aſſured that it was
on the other ſide theſe Mountains, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
50. Leagues from <hi>Zair.</hi> Moſt
Hiſtorians place a great number of
Monſters in theſe Quartecs, but upon
no other foundation than the recital of
thoſe who firſt invented it: all our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries
could not ſerve us to diſcover
the Original of a neighbouring Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which the Europians call <hi>Caffres,</hi>
and the Natives, the Country of <hi>Fordi.</hi>
We were informed that a Native ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
taken a ſmall She <hi>Tigres,</hi> became ſo
familiar with the Beaſt, that he loved her
Carnally, and committed that infamous
Crime with her, whence came an Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
half Man and half Beaſt, which
gave the original to theſe Savages,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54359:21"/>
which cannot be humanized; a very
probable proof of this relation, is that
their Heads and Feet are very like
thoſe of Tigers, and even their Body
is in ſome places markt with ſpots like
thoſe of theſe Animals.</p>
               <p>We returned by the River of <hi>Cari<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

more than forty ſix hours, afterwards
an Eaſt Wind ſo furiouſly toſt the Sea,
and drove us with that impetuoſity

us above a thouſand Leagues to the Weſt.
Many ſaw ſome Iſles on the right hand,

at the top of the water broke our Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
into two parts, and where we
found our ſelves expoſed to the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of the moſt inexorable of all the
Elements. I could never tell what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
of the other Ships, nor what was
the fortune of my Companions in this
wreck, becauſe 'twas in the night, and
very dark; for I was only buſied how
to ſave my ſelf: my other Shipwrack
had given me Experience and Faith, I
had ſought for a light Plauck during the
dangers of the Tempeſt; and I will
ſay it to my ſhame, that being far enough
removed from the approaches of death,
I always appeared very indifferent as
to my Life, but in this evident danger,
I could think of nothing elſe but how
to ſave my ſelf. I floated for many
hours by the means of my Plank, with
ſuch a toſſing and turning over and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:54359:22"/>
that I can't now think of it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
horror: The Waves did ſo often
plunge me under, and overturn me, that
tho I held out as long as I could, yet at
laſt I loſt both knowledge and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and truly I knew not what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
of me, nor by what means I was
preſerved from death; I only remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that coming to my ſelf I opened
my eyes, and found a calm Sea, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
an Iſle very near, and I felt my
hands ſo clencht to the Plank, that I
could hardly looſe them, and my ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
were ſo crooked that I could not
by any means bring them to themſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the ſight of this Iſland encouraged me
very much, and infine, being come on
ſhore, I drag'd my ſelf under a Tree,
without thinking of any thing but lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing,
and expecting death in a little
time; I found under this Tree two
fruits, about the bigneſs, and like in
Colour to our Pomegranets, with this
difference, that their taſt appeared to me
much more delicate, ſubſtantial and
nouriſhing; having eaten the firſt, my
ſpirits recovered, and my heat grew
light, and having eaten the ſecond I
ſound my ſelf ſufficiently ſatisfied, but
I was ſo bruiſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that I was in great pain
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54359:23"/>
to bear my ſelf up, ſo I lay down and
fell into ſo deep a ſleep, that I was at
leaſt 24 hours before I awakt, after this
ſleep I found that I was not in the leaſt
a weary, I ſaw that my Cloaths were
dry, and the Sun ſhone, and inſpired
me with a courage and hope: I found
two other fruits, which I did eat, and
having applyed my ſelf to find out the
Elevation of the Sun, I judged that I
was 33 deg. Lat. South, but I knew
not the Longitude; having reſted my
ſelf again I reſolved to advance into the
Iſle, to diſcover if there were any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants,
I plainly ſaw the appearance
of ſome ways, but they led into very
thick Buſhes, where I could not paſs
without ſtooping, which gave me very
ſtrange thoughts; having found a tree
much higher than the reſt, I thought
that if I climbed to the top of it, I
might diſcover ſome place or other,
but as I got up I heard a great noiſe,
and I ſaw two prodigious flying Beaſts,
which came to the top of the tree,
obliged me to get down a little faſter
than I got up: Be not ſurprized at the
name of Beaſt, which I here gave to the
Birds, for they were ſo very large that I
was frighted at them, and ſpeak then
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54359:23"/>
as I thought. I got down with all the
ſpeed imaginable, but I was no ſooner
down, but heard ſo frightful a Cry,
that I expected every moment to be
devoured: In fine, coming to my ſelf,
I reflected upon the miſery I ſaw my
ſelf reduc'd to, I concluded that it were
better to dye forthwith, than to ſeek
to languiſh any longer, after all, I ſaid,
there's a neceſſity that I dye by ſome
means or other, and I cannot ſhun one
danger, but run into a greater.</p>
               <p>I then made a reſolute preparation for
death, and remembring that my Father
and Mother expir'd upon the Sea ſhore,
I made thither, where I had left my
Plank: I had ſcarce left my place but I
was followed by a great number of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
which I could not diſtinguiſh
from one another, nevertheleſs I had
my judgment as ready as could poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
be expected upon ſuch an occaſion,
I thought I ſaw certain kinds of Horſes,
but with pointed Heads, and claw-footed,
I can't tell whether theſe were not of
thoſe Beaſts, which came to light upon
the tree where I was, but they had
Wings and Feathers. I ſaw certain kinds
of great Dogs, and many other ſorts
of Animals, which don't at all reſemble

any that we have in <hi>Europe,</hi> they made
great Crys ſo ſoon as they perceiv'd me,
and as they approacht nearer and near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
they redoubled the Noiſe. I reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to defend my life, and took my
Plank and began to exerciſe it, in turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and returning it, which made 'em
very attentive, till two of the largeſt
Beaſts approacht to come in with me,
I turned to one of them, and ſtruck
it ſo roughly that it ran back to the
other Animals, which ſet 'em all on
howling: I was ſeized with an extreme
fear, at the redoubling of theſe terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
cries, and in great haſt took three
fruits of the Tree which I have ſpoken
of, and caſt my ſelf into the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with my Plank; after having
ſwam ſuch a diſtance as it was reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
enough for me to believe I was out
of all danger: I turned my eyes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the Iſle, and I ſaw upon the ſhoar
all that great number of Animals which
I fled from, part of them put themſelves
readily to ſwim, and purſued me with
that vigour and haſt, that they were
not long before they came up to me,
when I ſaw that I could not eſcape, I
turned towards them, and preſented the
end of my Plank to them, with ſucceſs
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54359:24"/>
happy enough, for as they preſt on to
take and bite the end, they made me
advance as faſt as themſelves, this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
continued till I arrived at a
ſmall kind of a little Iſle, which floated
upon the Water; and which carried
me away, ſwift enough to remove the
means of my Enemies joyning me: they
followed me nevertheleſs with a Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
or rather with an encreaſed Rage,
till they diſpaired of being able to come
at me again; but at laſt my Iſle happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to ſtoop on a ſudden, they had
time of coming up to me again: I
ſcarce knew what to think, and began
to make unprofitable reflections in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing
the cauſe of the Immobility of
the Iſle, whoſe motion had been ſo favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to me, I ſaw four of thoſe great
flying Animals which I have ſpoken of,
which came to the aſſiſtance of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
when they were ready to fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me. I covered my ſelf with my
plank, to avoid their firſt attacks, which
were ſo rude that with a ſtroak with
their Beak, they pierc'd it thro', 'twas
then that my Iſle raiſing it ſelf, ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
with an extreme impetuoſity
ſhakt me, and threw me more than 50
Paces from it, I believed that it was a
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:54359:25"/>
kind of Whale, which Naturaliſts men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
For one of theſe monſtrous Birds
placing her ſelf upon its back, thruſt
her Talons into its fleſh, it lifted it ſelf
up as I thought, above one hundred
Cubits out of the Water, with a noiſe
as terrible as that of Thunder. This
toſs wholly conquer'd my ſpirits, ſo
that I knew not what became of me
then, but my crooked fingers were the
cauſe that I quitted not my Plank; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a little come to my ſelf, I ſaw the
Creature which bounded, and it caſt
water out of its Noſtrils, with horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
hiſſings; and afterwards ſunk down
again, clear under the water.</p>
               <p>The Birds which purſued me were
retired, ſo that I found my ſelf alone
in the midſt of the water, without
any other aſſiſtance than my piece of
Wood, and without any other thought
than that of death, which I well ſaw
could not be avoided; I was ſo ſpent
with the Fatigues which I had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone,
and ſo incommoded with the
water which I had ſwallowed down,
that no one would think humanity ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of reſiſting ſo great Evils in this
Eſtate, I remembred my fruits and eat
two of them, after which I found it
impoſſible to avoid ſleeping, ſo that I
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:54359:25"/>
was oblig'd to turn me upon my plank,
with my face upwards, to be in ſome
manner without danger of being
ſtrangled by the waters. I cloſed my
eyes, and knew not how long I tarried
in this poſture, but I wakned at laſt
by the rays of the Sun, which darted
very bright upon my face; and I found
that I was driven by the Wind <hi>North-Eaſt,</hi>
with great ſwiftneſs, altho the
Sea was pretty ſmooth. I thought my
heart and mind in a very calm po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture;
and a little after I found my
ſelf very near a Country, whither the
Wind had driven me; my crooked
fingers were ſo clinched to my plank,
that I had much ado to diſentangle
them to get upon ſhore; my Cloaths
were ſo heavy with the water which
they had drunk up, that I could ſcarce
carry them, the toſſing of the Sea, and
ſalt water which I had drank, had ſo
diſtemper'd my head, that I found
much ado to endure it; <hi>I</hi> was like a
man, whom the exceſs of Wine, or
many turnings had made giddy, and
rendred incapable of doing any thing
to the purpoſe, all that <hi>I</hi> could do was
to trail my plank at a certain diſtance,
where <hi>I</hi> layed me down and ſoon fell
a ſleep, my ſleep in ſome meaſure ſetled
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:54359:26"/>
my Brain, and dryed my cloaths, which
<hi>I</hi> rub<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d to make 'em leſs incommodious;
<hi>I</hi> remembred <hi>I</hi> had yet one of theſe
fruits which <hi>I</hi> have ſpoken of, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
eaten it, <hi>I</hi> perceived that want of
nouriſhment was the principal cauſe of
my extreme weakneſs; <hi>I</hi> then advanced
to ſeek out ſomething elſe, and after
having marched about 200 Paces <hi>I</hi>
found many Trees, but <hi>I</hi> perceived no
fruit, which made me fall into a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
raving, tho <hi>I</hi> forbore not all
the time to march on, and as <hi>I</hi> went,
<hi>I</hi> lookt downwards, and ſaw two fruits
upon the Earth, which were covered with
leaves, I took 'em as a <hi>preſent from Heaven,</hi>
and after I had eaten one of them, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
my ſtrength to encreaſe, which
encouraged me to advance on my way,
and to examine the place where <hi>I</hi> might
be, which <hi>I</hi> found to be about 35 deg.
<hi>South: I</hi> ſaw many ſigns which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
me that the firm Land was
not far off, the water was very freſh.
The Winds blew South, and <hi>I</hi> remarkt
that they were very much interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
<hi>I</hi> even perceived certain extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Vapours, in a word, <hi>I</hi> flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
my ſelf that <hi>I</hi> ſaw ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearence
of a Country, and endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
much to get forward, <hi>I</hi> found a
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54359:26"/>
Tree laden with great fruit, whoſe
branches were bowed, down to the
Earth; the place was all tapiſtred with
Flowers of divers colours, and perfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with very agreeable Odours; as
ſoon as <hi>I</hi> had eaten of this fruit <hi>I</hi>
fell into a great benumneſs, and <hi>I</hi> was
ſo affected, that in looking upon all
things about me, <hi>I</hi> could ſee nothing
diſtinctly: A little time after <hi>I</hi> heard
many howlings of Beaſts, which ſeemed
to be very near me, and <hi>I</hi> ſoon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
Seven, which were of the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and colour of our great Bears,
beſides that every Paw appeared as
bigg as their whole Head, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacht
me, and retired many times
without touching me, but at laſt, they
came up all together, on purpoſe to
devour me, and <hi>I</hi> was all bloody, when
two great Birds of the form of thoſe
which <hi>I</hi> have mentioned above, came
to light upon theſe Animals, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
them to retire, and to hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in the next Caverns they could
meet with: The Birds perſued them,
but catching none of them, they came
back to me, and after having given
me ſome wounds with their Talons,
one of them ſeized me between her
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:54359:27"/>
two feet, and lifted me up very high
in the Air; The Girdle that <hi>I</hi> had
went many times about me, and ſav'd
my life, by keeping me from being
pierced into the Entrails, however <hi>I</hi>
was in continual fear; after a long
way theſe animals reſted themſelves
upon a Rock, where that which carried
me ſet me down, and the other ſeiz'd
me after the ſame manner that the
firſt did. In fine, the pain that they
put me to, became in ſupportable, and
having caſt me into a kind of diſpair,
<hi>I</hi> threw my ſelf vigorouſly upon his
neck, and found ſtrength enough to tear
out his eyes with my Teeth, he fell at
the ſame time into the water, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
let me go, <hi>I</hi> ſoon mounted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his back, his Companion who flew
before, to divide the Air, perceiving
that the other followed not; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſeen us upon the Water, turned
back and fell upon me, with a dreadful
impetuoſity, he pitcht upon my ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and ſtruck ſuch blows at me, as
would have been mortal if they had
hit me. <hi>I</hi> always kept a little Poni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
at my Girdle, which <hi>I</hi> thruſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Belly with much ado, for theſe
Birds are almoſt impenitrable, as we
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54359:27"/>
ſhall ſee afterwards, having two great
Scales which environ them, and which
defend 'em, like thoſe of Tortoiſes;
whilſt I fought againſt this ſecond
Enemy, the firſt ſlipt from under my
Thighs, and got from me, which made
me lay hold on one of the Claws of
the laſt, by which he lift me up ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
high, and I held faſt for fear of
falling, he cry'd terribly, and after
having raiſed himſelf pretty high, he
threw himſelf into the Sea again, and
by the favour of this Element I had
the liberty to caſt my ſelf upon his
neck, and ſo got upon his back: He
howled at the loſs of his blood, tumbled
and turned himſelf after a thouſand
ways to ſhake me off, and conſtrain me
to leave him.</p>
               <p>I thought then of nothing elſe but of
holding him faſt, to hinder the effect
of his effort, becauſe that my Plank
which was my only aſſiſtance, being loſt,
I ſaw no mean betwixt quitting him and
periſhing: at laſt he ſtaied upon the
Water without any other motion than
an Ox, whoſe throat is cut, confeſſing
by his ſtilneſs that I had overcome him,
having then ſome leiſure to take breath
and to think of my Wounds, I could
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:54359:28"/>
not diſtinguiſh any part in all my body
which was not torn and bloody; my
Cloaths were all rent, not one part eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caping,
whole, the water of the Sea,
altho 'twas very freſh in that place, yet
was ſalt enough to cauſe ſuch pain as
made me loſe my Senſes. I apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſometime afterwards, that ſome
Guards from the Sea ſaw part of this
Combat, and that four were come in a
little Shalop to ſee if they could know
who I was, they believed me to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Life, and drew me into their Boat
as a dead man, who had expired in his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory:
as ſoon as they perceiv'd any
motion in my heart, they put into my
Mouth, Noſe and Ears a Liquor, which
ſoon made me open my Eyes, and ſee
my <hi>Benefactors;</hi> they made me drink of
a ſort of Water, which gave me new
ſtrength, and recovered my Spirits;
they waſht my Body with an odoriferous
Water, they anointed my Wounds
and bound them up very Commodiouſly,
having thus brought me out of danger,
they purſued my Enemies, and having
drawn the laſt into the Boat, they laid
him at my feet, the other had ſtill ſome
motion; but explaining to them by ſigns
that I had pluckt out his Eyes, they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:54359:28"/>
him, took him, and laid him upon
the other, with great marks of rejoycing,
they returned to Land, from which they
were diſtant about three hours rowing,
and having brought me to ſhoar, they
bore the two Fowls at my feet, with ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations,
like to thoſe they are uſed to
make in their greateſt Victories.</p>

               <p>IF there was any thing in the World
which could perſwade me of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable
fatallity of humane things, and
the infalible accompliſhments of thoſe

be this Hiſtory that I am writing; there
is not on ſingle accident of my Life,
which has not been ſerviceable either
to direct or ſupport me in this new

one day be driven. My often Shipwracks
taught me to bear them; both Sexes
were neceſſary for me under pain of
being deſtroyed at my arrival, as I ſhall
ſhow in the ſequel of my Story. It was
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:54359:29"/>

I had been known to be a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

into great reputation amongſt thoſe
that were wittneſſes of it, I ſhould have
been forced to have ſubmitted to an
examination, that would have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
followed with my death. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine,
the more all the Circumſtances of
my Voyages and perils ſhall be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
the more clearly it will appear
that there is a certain order of things in
the fate of man, and ſuch a chain of
effects that nothing can prevent, and
which brings us by a thouſand imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible
turnings, to the end to which
we are deſtined.</p>
               <p>The cuſtom of the Inhabitants of
this Country is never to receive any
perſon amongſt them, whoſe Humour,
Birth and Country, they know not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
But the extraordinary Courge
with which they had ſeen me fight;
and the great admiration they conceiv'd
at my reviving after it, made me with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any inqueſt be admitted into the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:54359:29"/>
neighbouring quarter, where every one
came to <hi>Kiſs my Hands:</hi> They would
alſo have carryed me upon their Heads,
the greateſt mark of high eſteem that
they ſhow to any perſon; but as they
perceived it could not be without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comoding
me, ſo they omitted this ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony.
My reception being made,
thoſe that had brought and comforted
me, carryed me to the Houſe of the
<hi>Heb,</hi> which ſignifies, a Houſe of Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;
they had provided me a lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and all things neceſſary, with ſuch
a diligence, as ſurpaſſed the Civility of
the moſt poliſhed Europeans: I was
ſcarcely arrived when two Hundred
young <hi>Auſtralians</hi> came and ſaluted me
in a very friendly manner; the deſire
I had to ſpeak to them, made me call to
mind ſome words that I had heard at
<hi>Congo,</hi> and among others that of <hi>Rim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi>
which I made uſe of, it ſignifies,
<hi>I am your Servant,</hi> at this word they
believed me to be of their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and cryed out with great ſigns of
joy, <hi>Le cle, le cle,</hi> that is, <hi>our Brother,
our Brother,</hi> and at the ſame time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
me with two fruits of a red
colour, intermixt with blew, I had no
ſooner eat them, but they refreſhed,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:54359:30"/>
and ſtrengthend me very much; they
gave me afterwards a kind of a yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
bottle of Liquor, that held a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
a good glaſs, which I drank with
ſuch a pleaſure as I had never before
felt: I was in this Country, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
theſe <hi>New faces, like a man fallen
from the Clouds,</hi> and I found it difficult
to believe I truly ſaw what I did; I
imagin'd to my ſelf ſometimes, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
I might be dead, or at leaſt in a
Trance, and when I convinced my ſelf
by many reaſons, that I was certainly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live,
and in my perfect ſences; and yet
I could not perſwade my ſelf that I was in
the ſame Country, or with men of the

entirely: cured in fifteen days, and
in five Months learnt enough of the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage

of the River <hi>Sulm,</hi> which makes a very

of this River live a people which are

               <p>This is all that I can have a certain
knowledge of, as to that ſide of <hi>Auſtralia,</hi>
which is towards the Line; it is limited
towards the Pole, by prodigious Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
much higher and more in acceſſible
than the <hi>Pirhenean,</hi> which ſeparate <hi>France</hi>

they begin towards the fiftieth degree,
falling inſenſibly, for ſixty five Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
unto the ſixtieth degree, and then
riſing again unto the forty eighth, and
returning afterwards unto the fifty fifth
degree, after which it riſes to the forty
third, and then ends in the Sea.</p>
               <p>At the foot of theſe Mountains they
diſtinguiſh theſe following Countrys;
<hi>Curf,</hi> which extends it ſelf from the
Mountains unto <hi>Huff;</hi> afterwards <hi>Curd;</hi>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:54359:31"/>
then <hi>Gurf, Durf, Jurf,</hi> and <hi>Surf,</hi> which
laſt ends in the Sea. In the middle of
the Countrys, between the Mountains
and the <hi>Auſtralian</hi> Coaſts lies <hi>Trum,
Sum, Burd, Purd Burf, Turf,</hi> and <hi>Pulg,</hi>
which joyns to the Sea. Thus the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtralian
Territories contain twenty ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
different Countries, which are all
very conſiderable, and are altogether
about three thouſand Legues in length,
and four or five hundred in breadth.</p>
               <p>The Vally which is on the other ſide
of the Mountains is ſometimes twenty
degrees broad, and ſometimes but ſix on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
it is parted by two Rivers, which are
very broad at the mouth, one of which
runs to the Weſt, and is called <hi>Sulm,</hi> and
the other to the Eaſt, named <hi>Hulm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The length of this Country is about
eight hundred Leagues, and its breadth
ſix hundred in ſome places, but in moſt
but three. All this vaſt Land is called
<hi>Fund;</hi> and is under two or three Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors,
which very often make cruel
Wars, one againſt the other. But what
is moſt ſurprizing in the <hi>Auſtralian</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
is, that there is not one
Mountain to be ſeen; the Natives ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
levelled them all. To this prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
may by added the admirable unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:54359:32"/>
of Languages, Cuſtoms, Buildings,
and other things which are to be met
with in this Country. 'Tis ſufficient to
know one Quarter, to make a certain
judgment of all the reſt; all which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt proceeds from the nature of
the people, who are all born with an
inclination of willing nothing contrary
to one another; and if it ſhould happen
that any one of them had any thing that
was not Common, 'twould be impoſſible
for him to make uſe of it.</p>
               <p>There are fifteen thouſand <hi>Sezains,</hi> in

be about fourſcore and 16 Millions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting
all the Youth, and Maſters lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the <hi>Hebs,</hi> in each of which there
is at leaſt eight hundred perſons; and
as in the fifteen thouſand <hi>Sezains,</hi> there
is ſixty thouſand <hi>Hebs,</hi> ſo the young
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:54359:32"/>
men, and the Maſters that teach them,
will be found to amount to near forty
eight millions.</p>
               <p>The great Houſe of the <hi>Sezain,</hi> which
they call the <hi>Hab,</hi> that is, the Houſe of
elevation, is built only with diaphonous
and tranſparent Stones, like to our fineſt
Cryſtal, only theſe Stones are diverſify'd
with a prodigious quantity of Figures of
all forts of colours, very fine and lively,
which by their infinite variety form
ſometimes Images of Mankind, ſometimes
repreſent the Fields in all their Beauty,
and ſometimes Suns and other Figures,
of ſuch a vivacity, as can never be too
much admired. The whole Building is
without any Artifice, except the curious
cut of this Stone, with Seats all round it,
and ſixteen great Tables of a much more
lively red than that of our ſcarlet.</p>
               <p>There is four very conſiderable En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trances,
that anſwer to the four great ways
upon which it is ſituate: All without is
filled with very rare Inventions. They
aſcend unto the top of it by a thouſand
ſteps, upon which there is a kind of
Platform, that will eaſily contain forty
perſons. The Pavement of this ſtately
Houſe is much like our Jaſper, but the
colours thereof are much more lively
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:54359:33"/>
and are alſo full of Veins, of a very
rich blew, and a yellow which ſurpaſſes
the brightneſs of Gold: No one for a
conſtancy lives in it, but each Quarter
take their turns to ſupply the Tables for
the refreſhment of Paſſengers. This
great Houſe built in the middle of the
<hi>Sezain,</hi> and is about an hundred paces
daimeter, and three hundred and thirty
in circumference.</p>
               <p>The Houſe of the four Quarters by
them called <hi>Heb,</hi> which is the Houſe of
Education, is built of the ſame Stone
that the <hi>Hab</hi> is paved with, except the
Roof of it, which is made of a tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Stone, through which the Light en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
into it.</p>
               <p>The Pavement of it ſomething reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
our white Marble, but is intermixed
with a moſt lively red and green. This
fine Building is divided into four quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
by twelve great Croſſings, which
are made like four Semi-diameters: It is
about fifty paces diameter, and about an
hundred and fifty three paces in circuit.
Each Diviſion is allotted to the Youth of
that Quarter it belongs to; and there is
at leaſt two hundred Children, whoſe
Mothers, as ſoon as they have conceived
of them, enter there, and depart not
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:54359:33"/>
till the Children are two years of age,
and then they go out, leaving them to
the Care of certain young men, who
are there on purpoſe to inſtruct them.
Theſe young men, whereof there is a
very great number, are divided into five
Companies.</p>
               <p>The firſt are employed in teaching
Firſt-Principles, of which there are ſix
Maſters. The ſecond make it their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to give the common Reaſons for
Natural things, among which there are
four Maſters. The third are ſuch as are
remitted to diſpute, of whom there is
two Maſters. The fourth are ſuch as can
compoſe, and they have but one Maſter.
The fifth and laſt are thoſe that expect
to be choſe for Lieutenants, that is, to
fill the place of the Brethren that retire
from the World, of whom I ſhall give a
particular account afterwards.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the peculiar Officers of each
Quarter, which contribute to the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
and educating part of the World,
and they carry very regularly every day
what is neceſſary for their ſubſiſtence,
when they go to the Conference held in
the Houſe.</p>
               <p>The common Houſes, which they call
<hi>Hebs,</hi> that is, the Habitation of Men, are
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:54359:34"/>
in number twenty five in each Quarter,
each Houſe twenty five paces diameter,
and fourſcore paces in circumference.
They are divided like the <hi>Hebs,</hi> by two
great Walls, which make four diſtinct
ſeparations, and end each at an Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
They are built with white Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
like the Pavement of the <hi>Hebs,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the croſs Bars of the Windows, which
are of the ſame Cryſtal with the <hi>Habs,</hi>
for the conveniency of giving Light to
them. Each Apartment is inhabited by
four perſons, whom they call the <hi>Cle,</hi>
that is, <hi>Brethren.</hi> There is nothing to
be ſeen in theſe Buildings but four kinds
of Benches, which ſerve them to reſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
on, and ſome Seats for the ſame
uſe.</p>
               <p>The Partitions that they call <hi>Huids</hi> are
near three hundred paces in circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
and ſixty five in diameter: The
Figure of them is perfectly ſquare, and
they are divided into twelve curious Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
each of which goes round the Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
with a ſquare place in the middle
that is ſix paces diameter.</p>
               <p>The three firſt and greateſt Rows are
beautified with Trees, which bear ſuch
Fruits as are in great eſteem amongſt
them. Theſe Fruits are as big as the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:54359:34"/>
Callebaſhes of <hi>Portugal,</hi> which are ſeven
or eight inches diameter. The inſide of
them is red, and of a more exquiſite
taſte than any of our moſt delicate Meats,
one of which Fruits is ſufficient to ſatisfie
four men, though never ſo hungry.</p>
               <p>The next five are alſo planted with
Trees that bear Fruits of a charming yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
full of a moſt ſubſtantial Juice,
which is very refreſhing: The Liquor of
one of theſe Fruits will quench any ones
thirſt; and their cuſtom is to drink three
of them at a Meal.</p>
               <p>The four laſt rows are filled with little
Trees, which bear a Fruit about as large
as a Pappin, of a bright purple; its ſmell
is very fine, and ſo extraordinary the
taſte, that I can compare nothing to it,
that we eat in <hi>Europe.</hi> This Fruit hath
a Propriety of cauſing Sleep according to
the proportion they eat thereof, ſome of
which they are accuſtom'd to eat every
night, and if they eat but one, they are
ſure of ſleeping three hours.</p>
               <p>In each Alley they dig two Furrows of
an indifferent depth, in which there
grows Roots that bring forth three ſorts
of Fruits, one of which is not unlike our
Melons; the ſecond are as big as Boon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chretins,
but of a lovely blue; and the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:54359:35"/>
third much reſemble the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gourd,
but the colour and taſte are very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</p>
               <p>Theſe Fruits are equally in uſe through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all parts of this vaſt Country for their
nouriſhment. They have no Ovens, nor
any way to bake any Meat for them:
They neither know what Kitchin or
Cook means; their Fruits fully ſatisfie
their Appetite, without ever the leaſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
their Stomachs; they alſo make
them ſtrong and vigorous, and do not
overcharge them, or cauſe any digeſtion,
becauſe they are perfectly ripe, and have
nothing green or crude remains in them.</p>
               <p>There is a Tree in the middle of the
Square which is higher than the reſt, that
bears a Fruit as big as our Olives, but the
colour red, they call it <hi>Balf,</hi> or Tree of
Beauty, whereof if they eat four, they
become exceſſively gay and ſprightly; if
they eat ſix, they fall into a Sleep for
twenty four hours, but if they exceed
that number, they ſleep eternally, which
mortal ſleep is preceded, with all the ſigns
of the greateſt Joy and Pleaſure in the
World.</p>
               <p>'Tis very ſeldom that the <hi>Auſtralians</hi>
ſing throughout their whole lives, and
never dance; but they have no ſooner
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:54359:35"/>
eat this Fruit in ſuch quantity as I before
ſpoke of, but they ſing and dance until
Death puts a period to their exceſſive
Mirth.</p>
               <p>I ought not to forget, that all the Trees
which I have ſpoken of are at all times
full of ripe Fruits, Flowers, and Buds;
we have an Image of this marvellous
Fruitfulneſs in out Oranges, but with
this difference, that the ſeverity of our
Winters and heats of our Summers very
much injure them; whereas in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
it is a very difficult thing to be able
to obſerve any alteration.</p>
               <p>From what I have ſaid, it is eaſie to
imagin, that this great Country is plain,
without <hi>Foreſts, Marſhes,</hi> or <hi>Deſarts,</hi> and
equally, inhabited throughout; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
it deſcends ſomewhat towards the
Line, and there is an inſenſible aſcention
on the ſide of the Pole; but in four or
five hundred leagues it gains at leaſt three
in height.</p>
               <p>There is a great quantity of Water
that runs from the Mountains <hi>Juads,</hi> and
the <hi>Auſtralians</hi> know how to conduct
them ſo exactly, that they have brought
them round all their <hi>Sezains, Quarters,</hi>
and <hi>Apartments,</hi> which contribute much
to the fruitfulneſs of their Grounds.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:54359:36"/>
The Deſcent which I ſpoke of is not
only in reſpect to the Continent, but the
Sea alſo, which is ſo ſhallow for three
league, that it is troubleſome to go with
a Boat thereon; it is not upon the ſide of
the ſhore a Fingers depth, and after a
league it is not above a foot deep, and ſo
on in proportion; from whence it is eaſie
to conceive, that 'tis impoſſible to come
to this Land from the Sea ſide, without
the aſſiſtance of ſome few Rivers, which
are only known to the Inhabitants of this
Country.</p>
               <p>This ſame Deſcent is the cauſe alſo
that this whole Land is turn'd directly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Sun, to receive its Rays, and
with ſo much advantage, that it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
every where alike fertile; after
ſuch a manner, that we may ſay, the
Mountains, which are over againſt its
Pole, are ſo raiſed by Nature, and placed
there, only to preſerve this happy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
from the Rigours of the Sun. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
theſe terrible Bulwarks ſerve to
ſtop the Rays of the Sun, and reflect
them back to the fartheſt parts of this
Country; and 'tis upon this account that
its <hi>Inhabitants</hi> rejoyce in the poſſeſſion of
a Happineſs, which all the <hi>Northern</hi> Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are deſtitute of, which is to have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:54359:36"/>
ther exceſs of Heat in Summer, nor Cold
in Winter, or rather to have properly
neither Winter nor Summer.</p>
               <p>This Propoſition ought not to ſurprize
the Geographers, who having divided
the Earth into two equal parts, by the
Equinoxial Line, place as much heat and
cold on one ſide, as on the other, <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon this Principle, that the proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
or diſtance of the Sun cauſes Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
or Winter throughout the whole
Earth: But there are alſo Geographers
which have corrected this Error, and
without any knowledge of the <hi>Auſtralian</hi>
Land<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have obſerved, that if his Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
was true, it mu<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coes,</hi>
than in <hi>Portugal</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> becauſe
the Sun is never ſo far diſtant: Which is
contrary to the Experience of all thoſe
that have made a Voyage into that
Country, who aſſure us, the greateſt heats
there are always in the Dog-days, and
the greateſt Colds when the Sun is in
the Signs of <hi>Aquaries</hi> and <hi>Piſces,</hi> altho' it
is farther from them when it is in <hi>Capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn.</hi>
It is therefore moſt certain, that
Winter and Summer happen univerſally
throughout all the Earth in the ſame
time, altho' with great difference, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:54359:37"/>
to the different ſituations of the
Countries. I ſay moreover, the nearneſs
of the Sun contributes ſo little to the heat
of the Earth, that if we do but narrowly
obſerve it, we ſhall find when it is neareſt
'tis then that the leaſt heat is ſe<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t; for 'tis
well known in <hi>Europe,</hi> that the Months
of <hi>May</hi> and <hi>June</hi> are not ſo hot as <hi>July</hi>
and <hi>Auguſt;</hi> and there is often Froſts in
<hi>June,</hi> when the Sun is in its greateſt ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
and ſcorching heats in <hi>July,</hi> when
it is gone ſome diſtance from them; it is
therefore ſome other cauſe than its Proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
that heats the Earth. It happens
very often in its entire abſence, even at
night, the heat is much greater than in
the day, when it is preſent.</p>
               <p>But to return to the <hi>Aſtralians,</hi> they
know not what Rain is in this Country, no
more than in <hi>Africa:</hi> Nor do they ever
hear any Thunders &amp; 'tis but very rarely
that they ſee any fleeting C<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

is neither Flyes, nor Caterpillars, nor any
other Inſect. There's neither Spider, nor
Serpent, nor any venomous Beaſt to be
ſeen. In a word, 'tis a Land full of Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacies,
which are not to be met with in any
other part of the World, and which is
likewiſe exempted from all the Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies
that other places are troubled

               </p>
               <p>I always uſed to ſpeak what I thought; but I was
a little too free in declaring what I did not like in
their <hi>Manners,</hi> ſometimes to a Brother, ſometimes
to another, even by maintaining with Arguments
mine own Opinions; I ſpoke of their Nakedneſs
with certain terms of averſion, which extreamly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended

demanded of him, with a ſeeming earneſtneſs,
where were the Fathers of thoſe Children that were

This Diſcourſe, and ſome others of the like nature,
gave the <hi>Auſtralians</hi> a kind of hatred for me, and

Cold and grave Tone: <hi>It is no longer doubted but
thou art a Monſter, thy evil Genius and inſolent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
hath made thee deteſted amongst us. Some have
a long time deſign'd to deſtroy thee, and had it not been
for the Action which we our ſelves ſaw thee do, thou

made me ingeniouſly declare my Countrey, and
the Adventures that had brought me amongſt them.</p>
               <p>The old Man teſtifyed a great deal of pity for

I would ſhew my ſelf more reſerv'd in my Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners

He alſo told me he ſhould live two years

but Young, he would chooſe me in his Place. I know
well, <hi>ſays he,</hi> That being arriv'd in a Countrey
where thou ſeeſt many things contrary to what is
practiſed in thine, thou haſt ſome reaſon to be
ſurprized and aſtoniſhed; but as 'tis an inviolable
cuſtom with us to ſuffer no half-Man amongſt us,
as ſoon as we diſcover him either by his Sex or

thy manner of acting condemns thee, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

thee to that end is, that thou come without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

Reaſoning, which our beſt Phyſitians have not
been ignorant of, that it was impoſſible that we
ſhould be long liv'd. In which I agreed with

Age,</hi> but that Nature had ſeem'd ſufficiently to

by this matter, puſhed on with impatience
he had to hear me upon others. I confeſt to
him that both Sexes in one perſon was ſo rare
amongſt the <hi>Europeans,</hi> that ſuch as happen'd
to be born ſo, paſt for Monſters amongſt them;
and as for reaſoning, I aſſur'd him that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
every one was taught it, and that there
were publick Lectures made in many places. The
Old Man interrupted me then. <hi>Thou advanceſt
too much,</hi> ſaid he to me, <hi>take heed thou doſt not
cut thy ſelf off, mingle not Contradictions with thy
Relations; thou canſt never reconcile the uſe of Reaſon
with the excluſion of both Sexes in one perſon; and what
thou addeſt, that many reaſon among you, and that they
make publick Lectures in divers places, proves only
that reaſoning is baniſhed from you.</hi> The firſt fruit
of reaſoning is to know, and this knowledge on
neceſſity carries us to two things. The firſt, that
to be Man it is neceſſary to be entire and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat.
The ſecond, that to this end it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to be able to reaſon upon every thing
that preſents it ſelf to us. Your pretended Men
have not the firſt, ſince they are all imperfect;
nor have they the ſecond, ſince there's ſo few
amongſt them able to Reaſon. Canſt thou ſay
any thing againſt theſe Conſequences? I anſwer'd
him, that Reaſon taught us a Being was perfect
when it wanted nothing that Conſtituted its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and that therefore to add to it what good
things another poſſeſt, would not render it more
perfect, but rather make it Monſtrous. <hi>The Light
of the Sun is</hi> an admirable thing, <hi>added I,</hi> There
is nothing more beautiful than this <hi>Charming
Creature,</hi> by which we ſee all others, yet it could
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:54359:40"/>
never be prudent to ſay, that Man was perfect
becauſe he poſſeſt not this Rich Treaſure of Light?
It is neceſſary therefore firſt, to eſtabliſh what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitues
the Nature and Perfection of Man, then
we muſt certainly agree, and may Judge infallibly
of thoſe that are perfect, and ſuch as are defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.
Thou Argueſt Juſtly, replyed the <hi>Old Man,</hi>
I'll convince thee therefore by thy own Principles.
Thou knoweſt aſſuredly that Man is made of two
things, a Body more perfect then that of other
Animals, and a <hi>mind more Clear and Bright;</hi> the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of the Body employs every thing that a
Body may and can contain without deformity;
and that of the Mind requires a knowledge
that extends to what ever can be known, or at
leaſt a faculty of reaſoning which may conduce
to this extent of Knowledge. Tell me then, is
there not more perfection in poſſeſſing ſolely
what compoſes a Humane Body then in being
endowed but with one half thereof? Now it
it certain, that both Sexes are neceſſary for the
perfection of an entire Man. Wherefore I have
reaſon to ſay thoſe that have but one, are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect.
To which I anſwered, that we ought
to conſider Man as other Animals in reſpect to
his Body, and that as an Animal cannot be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
imperfect in its kind, becauſe it is but of
one Sex, ſo ever we cannot reaſonably ſay, that
Man is imperfect, becauſe he alſo is but of one.
And that on the contrary, the confuſion of Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
in the ſame perſon, ought rather to paſs for
a Monſtrous thing, then for a degree of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
Thy Manner of Arguing <hi>anſwer'd he</hi>
ſuppoſes you to be Juſt, as I preſume you are, that
is, <hi>Beasts;</hi> and if I cannot abſolutely ſay you
are ſuch, tis becauſe there remains upon you
ſome Marks of Humanity; and as you ſeem to
keep a kind of medium between Man and Beaſt,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:54359:40"/>
I believe I do you no injury in calling you <hi>half-Men.</hi>
As to what thou ſayeſt added he, that we are
like to Beaſts in reſpect to our Bodies, 'tis a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
great error to diſtinguiſh as thou doſt between
the mind of Man and his Body; the Union of
theſe two parts are after ſuch a manner that one
is comprehended in the other; ſo that all the
Powers imaginable cannot take any thing from
Man, no not even from his Body, which is ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
Humane, that it can never agree with that
of a Beaſt; and by conſequence Man in whatſoever
belongs to him, is perfectly diſtinct from Beaſt.
My Old Man in this place ſeeing that I had a
great deſire to make ſome reply, permitted me:
Therefore ſaid I to him, <hi>can it be deny'd that Man
agrees with the Beast in what regards Matter, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the Bodies of each were formed? Is it not equally
ſaid of both, that they feel, they cry, and perform all
the operations of their Senſes? Yes,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>it may
be deny'd, and I formally do it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Man has nothing as Man, that agrees with
the Beaſt; all the Chymerical Conceptions where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
thou entertaineſt thy ſelf are only defects of
thy reaſoning, which unites what cannot be joyn'd
together, and diſunities what is inſeparable; for
Example, when we ſay that Body in general equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reſpects Man and Beaſt; we mean that the word
Body may be equally applyed to both, becauſe
of ſome Analogy there is in Common between
them, yet however there is always a moſt eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential
difference between them. A Beaſt hath
perfect Conformity only with another Beaſt, and
that becauſe their Sexes are ſeparate, upon which
account it is neceſſary, that they reunite for the
propagation of their kind; But this Union can
never be ſo perfect to make two Animals one
perfect Being; neither can they continue long
together, without being obliged to a Separation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:54359:41"/>
Wherefore it is neceſſary for them to ſeek again
anew for themſelves, and they live in a kind of
Languiſhment while they are diſtant one from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.
<hi>As for us,</hi> added he, <hi>we are entire Men;
wherefore we live without being ſenſible of any of
theſe Animal Ardours one for another, and we cannot
hear them ſpoke of without horrour: Our Love has
nothing Carnal, nor Brutall in it; we are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
ſatisfyed in our ſelves, we have no need to
ſeek any happineſs from without, and live contented,
as you ſee we do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I cou'd not hear this man ſpeak without reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on that great Principle of our Philoſophy; that
the <hi>more perfect a Being is,</hi> the leſs need it has
of any Aſſiſtance from without.</p>
               <p>I made ſome Reflections upon the Operations
of the Sovereign Being: I concluded a Creature
cou'd not better reſemble him, then in acting ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
and alone like him, in all its Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and that an Action which was perform'd by
the concourſe of two perſons, cou'd not be ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
as that which was made by one only. My
Old Man perceived by the Suſpenſion of my
mind, that I began to be pleas'd with his Reaſons;
wherefore laying aſide the reſt of his Arguments,
and changing the diſcourſe, demanded of me, that
in caſe two perſons concurr'd in the production of
the ſame Child, to which of them it belong'd to by
right. I anſwer'd him equally to both; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
the example of many Animals, who made
it appear by their reciprocal cares, that their
young ones belong'd inſeparably to each. But he
with indignation rejected the example of Animals,
and told me, <hi>he would have no further Conference with
me, except I wou'd omit making any farther uſe of it;
becauſe by that I confirmed him,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>what he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to prove to me, that our production ſavour'd more
of Beaſt than man,</hi> and therefore he might with
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:54359:41"/>
juſtice look upon us as Half-Men. He added, <hi>that
this Mutual and indiviſible Poſſeſſion was lyable to
great difficulties, becauſe the Will of two cou'd never be
ſo regulated, but one wou'd wiſh ſometimes what was
contrary to the other, which wou'd undoubtedly produce
many Conteſtations.</hi> To which I anſwer'd, <hi>There was
great ſubordination in this poſſeſſion, and that the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Child were both ſubject to the Father;</hi> but the
word Father being wholly unknown to the <hi>Austra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,</hi>
I was obliged to expreſs it in ſuch terms
as he might moſt probably underſtand me; he
made me repeat it to him three times, and leaſt
he ſhou'd not apprehend me, he explain'd to me
what Idea he had conceiv'd of it: After which he
was entirely perſuaded of the common opinion of
the <hi>Australians,</hi> that we cou'd not be Men, and
cryed to himſelf with an extraordinary ſeverity,
<hi>O where is Judgment? Where is Reaſon? Where is the
Man? Where is the Man?</hi> which he repeated three
times; I told him, <hi>The Laws of the Country deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
it ſo, and that it was not without foundation, ſince
the Father being the Principle cauſe of Generation, it was
to him, that the Iſſue that might be produced, ought prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
to belong.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us diſcourſe in order upon this matter, ſaid
he, <hi>Thou hast advanced that the Father and Mother act
together to produce it; thou hast made me apprehend, that
the Mother is the moſt nearly concern'd in it; from whence
is it then that thou concludeſt the Father ought to be
lookt upon as the Principle Cauſe? If there is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency,
why giveſt thou it to the Father, ſince the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſeems to me to have the greateſt ſhare in it? Wou'd
it not be more reaſonable to look upon this pretended
Father as the accidental Cauſe, and the Mother, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
whom it is impoſſible it ſhou'd have Being, as the
natural and chief Cauſe? But tell me freely, Is this
Mother ſo tyed to the Father, that ſhe cannot unite
her ſelf with any other Man?</hi> I anſwered him with
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:54359:42"/>
a great deal of ſincerity, <hi>That it was not only poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
but that it often happened.</hi> If ſo replied he, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupting
me, <hi>He that takes the Title of Father can
never be certain he is effectively ſo; nothing is more ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
therefore, than to look upon him as Principal
Cauſe, who has concurr'd in the producing a Child,
ſince it is always uncertain, whether it was his or no;
and you cannot without Injuſtice take this Quality from
that of the two perſons that you call Mother, to ſpeak juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of things as they are in themſelves.</hi> I found my ſelf
ſhock't by the Diſcourſe of this Old man; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho
I cou'd not conſent to his Reaſon, which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
all our Laws, I cou'd not hinder my ſelf
from making a thouſand Reflections, and confeſſing
that they treated that Sex with too much ſeverity,
from whom all Mankind receiv'd ſo many obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
My thoughts furniſhed me then with an
hundred reaſons to maintain what my Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
had aſſerted; I found my ſelf forc'd to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that this great power which man had uſurped
over Woman, was rather the effect of an odious
Tyranny, than a Legitimate Authority.</p>
               <p>The firſt part of my propoſition being found
void, we entred upon the ſecond, which was in
reſpect to the underſtanding of the <hi>Europeans;</hi>
but my Old Man ſpoke of it very briefly, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
I had ſaid all that I cou'd upon the firſt head.
<hi>I doubt no longer now,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>what you</hi> Europe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<hi>are, it is a point which is fully clear'd. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs,</hi>
added he, <hi>as it cannot be deny'd, but thou haſt
ſhewn ſomething extraordinary both in thy Courage and
Reaſoning; ſo it is neceſſary that I know from whence
it might proceed: I aſſured him, that what he had
ſeen me do in the Combat, was rather an effect of
my diſpair than courage: That we had no ſuch Fools
to engage with amongſt us, but that Men fought
ſometimes amongst themſelves, till they had utterly
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:54359:42"/>
deſtroy'd one another. They are
exactly like the</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">A kind of <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> who border'd upon the <hi>Auſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians.</hi>
                  </note> Fondins,
ſaid he, <hi>and as I was going to
proceed: Thou hast,</hi> added he,
<hi>been with us long enough to
know us, and to be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of the Wiſdom of our Conduct.</hi> This word Man
which carries with it ſo neceſſary a conſequence
of Reaſon and Humanity, obliges us to an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which is ſo perfect amongſt us, that we know
not what Diviſion and Diſcord is; wherefore thou
muſt confeſs, either that we are more than Men,
or that we are leſs than Men, ſince that you are
ſo far from our perfection. To which I anſwer'd
it could not be deny'd but that the divers Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates
contributed much to the different In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
of their Inhabitants; that from thence
it happen'd, that ſome were more eager, others
more calm, ſome dull, others quick, which diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of Temperaments was the ordinary cauſe of
Diviſions, Wars, and all other Diſſentions, which
arm Men againſt one another; but he laught at
this Reaſon, maintaining, That man as man, could
never ceaſe to be man, that is, humane, reaſonable,
affable, without paſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe 'tis in this,
that the nature of man conſiſts; and as the Sun
cannot be a Sun when it does not give light; ſo a
man cannot be a man but he muſt differ eſſentially
from Beaſts, in whom Madneſs, Gluttony, Cruelty,
and other Vices and Paſſions are a conſequence of
their imperfect and defective Nature, that the who
was the Subject of theſe Defaults, was no more than
a vain and deceitful Image of a Man, or rather a
true Beaſt.</p>
               <p>I confeſs, that I could not hearken to this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
without admiration! and nothing ever edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed
me more than this purity of Morals, inſpir'd
by the only light of Nature and Reaſon. My Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:54359:43"/>
having ask'd me what I thought of that
way of Reaſoning? I anſwered, <hi>That indeed my
mind had been cultivated by Study, and that nothing was
omitted in my Education, that might carefully inform my
Judgment.</hi> Upon which he demanded, if the like
care was not equally taken throughout the World,
and having anſwered that indeed, he had more to
ſay upon that point; he included after his common
manner; this Irregularity caus'd many diſorders,
diſputes, heats and complaints, becauſe he that
knew leaſt (ſeeing others above him which knew
more) eſteem'd himſelf the more unhappy, that
Birth had made all alike. <hi>As for us,</hi> added he, <hi>we
make a Profeſſion of being all Equal, Our glory conſiſts in
being all alike, and to be dignify'd with the ſame Care,
and in the ſame manner; all the difference that there is,
is only in the divers Exerciſes to which we apply our
ſelves, ſo as to find out new Inventions, that the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverers
may contribute them to the Publick Good.</hi>
After this, he ſpoke to me of <hi>Habits,</hi> which he
call'd Superfluities amongſt the <hi>Europeans,</hi> and
I aſſur'd him, that they had as great an horror
amongſt them to ſee a Perſon Naked, as the
<hi>Auſtralians</hi> had to ſee them in Cloaths; I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
for Reaſons of this uſe, Modeſty, the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
of the Seaſon and Cuſtom.</p>
               <p>To this, as I remember, he anſwered, <hi>That cuſtom
ſo much prevails upon your minds, that one would believe
every thing neceſſary that you practice from your Birth,
and that you can't change a Cuſtom without as great a
violence as changing your own Nature.</hi> I replyed, by
inſiſting upon the Reaſon of divers Climates,
and told him, <hi>That there were ſome Countries amongſt
the</hi> Europeans, <hi>where the Cold was inſupportable to
the Body, which was more delicate than that of the</hi> Auſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralians,
<hi>and that there were ſome that even dy'd upon
it, and that it was impoſſible to ſubſiſt without Cloaths:</hi>
In fine, I told him, <hi>That the weakneſs of the nature</hi>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:54359:43"/>
                  <hi>of either Sex was ſuch, that there was no looking upon
one that was</hi> Naked without Bluſhing, and Shame,
<hi>and without being ſenſible of ſuch Emotions, as</hi> Modeſty
<hi>oblig'd me to paſs over in ſilence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Is there a Conſequence in all that thou haſt advanc'd</hi>
(ſaid he) <hi>and from whence can this custom come? Is not
this to father upon all the world what is contrary to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?
We are</hi> Born Naked, <hi>and we can't be cover'd
without believing that 'tis ſhameful to be ſeen as we are;
but as to what thou ſay'ſt concerning the</hi> Rigour of the
Seaſons, <hi>I can't, nay, I ought not to give any credit to
it; for if this Country is ſo inſupportable, what is it
that obliges him that knows what Reaſon is, to make it
his Country? muſt not he be more ſilly than a Beast, that
will tarry in thoſe places where the Air is mortal
at certain Seaſons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When Nature makes an Animal, it gives him
the liberty of Motion to ſeek what is good and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
that which is evil. How opinionative then
is man to ſtay where he is threatned on all ſides,
and where he muſt be in a Continual Torment to
preſerve himſelf? Certainly he muſt have loſt all
his ſenſes, if ever he had any; as for the weakneſs
which thou calls <hi>Modesty,</hi> I have nothing to ſay to
it, ſince thou confeſſeſt with ſo much ſincerity
that it is a fault, 'tis truly a great weakneſs which
will not permit us to look upon one another with
reſenting the <hi>Brutal Motions</hi> which thou ſpeakeſt of.
Beaſts continually ſee themſelves and one another,
but this ſight cauſes no alteration in them: How
then can you who believe your ſelves of a Superior
order to them be more weak than they? or elſe
it muſt be that your Sight is weaker than that
of Animals, ſince you can't ſee through a ſingle
<hi>Covering</hi> what is under; for there are ſome of them
that can even penetrate through a Wall; this is
all that I can Judge of thoſe of thy Country, becauſe
thou telleſt me they have ſome <hi>Sparks of Reaſon,</hi>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:54359:44"/>
but they are ſo weak, that inſtead of enlightning
them, they only ſerve to conduct 'em more ſurely
in their Error. If 'tis true that their Country is
inhabitable, at leaſt that they make uſe of <hi>Cloath
and Covering</hi> for the ends thou haſt mention'd,
they are juſt like thoſe perſons who inſtead of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
away from an Evident danger, reaſon finely
how they may preſerve themſelves, by covering
themſelves without avoiding the occaſion; but if
it be true that Cloaths render you wiſe in the Eyes
of one onother, I know not how to compare you
better than to little Children who no more know
an Object when once it is vail'd.</p>
               <p>As for me I rather believe that 'tis deformity
amongſt you which made you firſt invent cloathing,
and that it not only authorizes it now but alſo conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
it; for there is nothing in a Man <hi>finer than
himſelf</hi> when he is without defects, and has all the
Natural Qualities which concur to his entire per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
               <p>I harkned to this man rather as an <hi>Oracle</hi> than
a Philoſopher; all the propoſitions which he advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
were backt with ſuch <hi>Invincible Reaſoning.</hi> He
ſaid no more on this point, but without giving me
time to anſwer, he paſt to that of Covetouſneſs.</p>
               <p>I early perceived that he knew no more of it
but the Name, for having deſired him to explain
what he ment by it, I underſtood that his Idea
of it, was a <hi>weakneſs of mind,</hi> which conſiſted in
heaping up fine things without any profit.</p>
               <p>All the <hi>Auſtralians</hi> forſake ſomethings that are
neceſſary for their entertainment, but they know
not what it is to heap up, nor to keep any thing
againſt <hi>to Morrow,</hi> and their manner of living thus
may paſs for a <hi>Perfect Image of the State
that man at firſt enjoyed in Paradiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for <hi>Ambition,</hi> he had a groſs Idea of it;
but he defin'd it a deſire of mens being elevat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
above others.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:54359:44"/>
I told him that in <hi>Europe</hi> they held it for a
Maxim, that the <hi>Multitude</hi> without any order begat
confuſion, in which there was no guſt of the good
things in Life, and that Order ſuppos'd a <hi>Head,</hi>
to which all others were ſubject. From hence the
Old Man took occaſion to explain a Doctrine, of
which I indeed conceiv'd the meaning; but 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to diſcover the Knowledge of it to others
in ſo ſtrong and powerful terms as theſe which he
made uſe of to make me underſtand it. He ſaid,
that it was the Nature of Man <hi>to be born and live free,</hi>
and that therefore he could not be Subjected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being diſpoil'd of his Nature; and that in ſuch
a ſubjection Man was made to deſcend below Beaſts,
becauſe a Beaſt being only made for the ſervice of
Man, <hi>Subjection was after ſome manner Natural to it.</hi>
But one man could not be born for the ſervice of
another Man; a Conſtraint in this Caſe would
be a ſort of violence which would even degrade a
Man after a certain manner from his proper Exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
he enlarged much to prove that the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
of one Man to another was a Subjection of
the humane Nature, and making a Man a <hi>ſort of
Slave to himſelf,</hi> which Slavery implyed ſuch a
Contradiction and violence as was impoſſible to
conceive. He added that the <hi>Eſſence of Man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſisting
in Liberty,</hi> it could not be taken away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
deſtroying him, and therefore he that would
take away anothers Liberty, did tacitly bid him to
ſubſiſt without his own Eſſence.</p>
               <p>Our Conference laſted above <hi>four hours,</hi> and if
the hour of publick Aſſembly had not interrupted
as, we were in a diſpoſition to have diſcours'd
much longer. I entred the <hi>Hab</hi> with a mind full of
<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll the reaſoning which I had heard, admiring the
Knowledge and great Light wherewith this People
were endu'd. The ſtrength of this Mans Reaſons
<hi>ſuſpended my Senſes,</hi> and I paſt the time of this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:54359:45"/>
in a kind of an Aſtoniſhment; it ſeem'd to
me that <hi>I ſaw things after another Faſhion than before:</hi>
I was for above Eight Hours, as it were forc'd to
make continual Compariſons <hi>betwixt what I was,
and what I ſaw; I could not but admire a Conduct ſo
appoſite to our defective one, that</hi> I <hi>was aſham'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
how far we were from the perfection of theſe
People.</hi> I ſaid in my ſelf, can it be true that we are
not all made Men? but, added I, <hi>If it is not ſo, what
is the difference of theſe People from us? They are by the
ordinary state of Life elevated to a pitch of a Vertue
which we cannot attain but by the greatest efforts of our
moſt noble Ideas. Our best Morality is not capable of
better Reaſoning,</hi> nor more exactneſs, than what
they practice Naturally without Rules, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Precepts; this <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion which nothing can alter, this
diſtance from Worldly Goods, this inviolable Purity;</hi>
in a word, this adherence to ſtrict Reaſon, which
unites them amongſt themſelves, and carries them
to what is good and juſt, can't but be the <hi>Fruits of
a conſummate Vertue,</hi> than which we can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
nothing more perfect; but on the contrary,
how many Vices and Imperfections are we not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to? <hi>This inſatiable thirst after Riches, theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
diſſentions, theſe black Treaſons, bloody Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies,
and cruel Butcheries,</hi> which we are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
exerciſing towards one another; don't theſe
things force us to acknowledge that we are guided
by Paſſion rather than Reaſon? Is it not to be
wiſht that in this Eſtate, one of theſe Men
which we may call <hi>Barbarians</hi> would come to
diſabuſe us, <hi>and appear in ſo much Vertue as they
practice purely by their Natural Light,</hi> to confound
the Vanity which we draw from our pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Knowledge, and by the aſſiſtance of which
we only <hi>live like Beaſts.</hi>

               <head type="sub">Of the Religion of the <hi>Auſtralians.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THere is no Subject more curious and ſecret
among the <hi>Auſtralians,</hi> than that of their
Religion; 'tis a crime of Innovation even to ſpeak
of it, either by Diſpute or a Form of Explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
even the Mothers do with the firſt Principles
of Knowledge, inſpire into the Child that of the
<hi>Hab,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>incomprehenſible.</hi> They believe
that this Incomprehenſible Being is every where,
and they have all imaginable Veneration for him,
but they recommend carefully to the young Men to
Adore him always, without ſpeaking of him, and
they are perſwaded that it was a very great Crime,
to make his Divine Perfections the Subject of their
Diſcourſes, ſo that one may in a manner ſay, that
their great Religion is not to ſpeak of Religion. As
I had been brought up in Maxims very different
from theirs, I could have no guſt in a Worſhip
without Ceremonies, nor accommodate my ſelf to
a Religion where I never heard the Name of God
mentioned. This cauſed great diſquiet in me for
ſome time, but at length I diſcover'd my troubles
to my Old Phyloſopher, who having heard me,
took me by the hand, and conducting me into a
Walk; he ſaid to me with a very gave Air, <hi>Is it
poſſible that you ſhould be more a Man in the knowledge
of the</hi> Hab <hi>than in your other Actions; open thy Heart,
and I promiſe thee to conceal nothing from thee.</hi> I was
raviſht to find ſuch a favourable opportunity to
learn the particular Faith of theſe People: I then
told my Old Man, that we had two ſorts of the
Knowledge of God in <hi>Europe,</hi> the one Natural, the
other ſupernatural. Nature inſtructed us that there
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:54359:46"/>
was a Soveraign Being, the Author and Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of all things: I can ſee this Truth, <hi>added I,</hi>
with my Eyes, <hi>when I behold the Earth view tbe Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
or reflect upon my ſelf;</hi> when I ſee ſuch things
as are not made but by a Superiour Cauſe, I am
obliged to acknowledge and adore a Being, which
cannot be made, and which made all things elſe.
When <hi>I</hi> conſider my ſelf, <hi>I</hi> am aſſured that <hi>I</hi> could
not be without a beginning, therefore it follows,
that a perſon like me would not give me to be,
and by conſequence this puts me upon ſeeking out
a firſt Being, who having had no Beginning, muſt
be the Original of all other things. When my
Reaſon conducted me to this firſt Principle, <hi>I</hi>
concluded evidently, that this Being cannot be
limited, becauſe limits ſuppoſe a neceſſity of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
and dependance.</p>
               <p>The Old Man interrupting my diſcourſe in my
laſt words, told me with many <hi>fine Remarks,</hi>
that if our <hi>Europeans</hi> could form this reaſoning, they
were not altogether depriv'd of the moſt ſolid
Knowledge; <hi>I always reaſoned thus with my ſelf,</hi>
added he, <hi>as thou hast done, and altho' the way
of ariving to this Truth by theſe kind of Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
be extreamly long, yet I am perſwaded that 'tis
feaſible. I confeſs nevertheleſs that the great Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
of many thouſand Ages may have cauſed
great Alteration in what we ſee; but my Mind
permits me not from hence either to conceive an
Eternity, or apprehend a General production with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the</hi> Conduct of a Soveraign Being,
who is the Supream Governour; for
this would be an Abuſe upon him, and
<hi>charge him with Error amongst a thouſand Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions,
if we averr that all we ſee, happned by the
fortuitous rancounters which have had no other princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
but that of local motion and the juſtling together of
little ſmall Bodies. This is to perplex one's ſelf in ſuch</hi>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:54359:46"/>
                  <hi>difficulties as we can never reſolve, and to put us in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of committing an Execrable Blaſphemy; this is to give
to the Creature what belongs to the Creator, and by
conſequence to repay him with an inſupportable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude
to whom we are obliged for what we are
and have, Even at what time we conceive that the
Eternity of Atoms is poſſible; it is certain the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
opinion is no leſs, not to ſay more probable. This
would be as wilful a Crime as to admit that Atoms
are capable of ſentiment and knowledge.</hi> 'Twas
theſe Conſiderations that oblig'd us about 45
Revolutions ſince, to ſuppoſe a firſt Being, and
to teach it as the foundation of all our Principles,
without ſuffering that any one ſhould teach any
Doctrine which ſhould oppoſe this Truth. I hark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to the diſcourſe of this Man, with all the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that I was capable of; the Grace with which
he ſpoke, and the weight which he gave to his
words, perſwaded me no leſs than his reaſons; but
as I ſaw he was about to ask me a new Queſtion, I
prevented him, and ſaid, <hi>That altho one ſhou'd grant
the Eternity of theſe little Bodies, we have ſpoken of,</hi> yet
they <hi>could never frame this World, and diverſify it as
we now ſee it, according to this indiſputable principle;
things continuing in the ſame State, cannot produce other
things different from them.</hi> Thus theſe <hi>Atoms</hi> having no
difference amongſt themſelves but Number and plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality,
could only make formleſs Heaps, and of that
ſame Quality with themſelves. <hi>That which is moſt
difficult to certain mind,</hi> (ſaid he,) <hi>is the great Obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this Being of Beings, which is no more diſcoverable
than if he was not at all; but I found this reaſon of little
weight, becauſe we have many others which oblige us to
believe that he is too far above us to manifest himſelf to
us otherwiſe than by his works; If his Condust was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
I ſhould be at a loſs to perſwade my ſelf that it
was his, ſince an univerſal Being ought to act after an
univerſal manner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:54359:47"/>
But if it be true, replyed I, that you cannot doubt
of a firſt and Sovereign Origine of all things, why
have you not eſtabliſht a Religion for to adore him?
The <hi>Europeans</hi> who have ſuch a knowledge of him
as you have, have <hi>Set hours for his Worſhip,</hi> they have
Prayers to call upon him, and Praiſes to Glorify
him with, and his Commandments to keep;
you ſpeak very freely of that <hi>Hab,</hi> ſaid he, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
me; yes without doubt anſwered I, tis a
Subject moſt agreeable and entertaining to us, for
we ought to find nothing more delightful, than to
ſpeak of him on whom we abſolutely depend for
Life and Death; nothing is more juſt and neceſſary
ſince 'tis by this only that we can Execute our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of him, and our reverence towards
him.</p>
               <p>There is nothing more reaſonable than that, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
he; but are your opinions the ſame touching
this <hi>incomprehenſible.</hi> There's a few, anſwered I, which
think not the ſame, in relation to Sovereign per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.
<hi>Tell me poſſitively and clearly,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>with
eagerneſs, what do your</hi> reaſonings upon this Divine
Being liken him to? I confeſt ſincerely that our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
were divided in the concluſions which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one often drew from the ſame principles: this
cauſes many ſharp <hi>contestations</hi> from whence there
often ariſes the moſt envenom'd Hatreds, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
even bloody Wars, and at other times Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences
no leſs fatal.</p>
               <p>This good Old Man replyed very briskly,
that if <hi>I</hi> had made any other Anſwer, he
would have had no further Conference with
me, but ſhould have had the greateſt Contempt
for me; for, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> 'tis moſt certain that
<hi>Men cannot ſpeak of any thing thats incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
without having divers Opinions of it;</hi> nay
even ſuch as are even contrary one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:54359:47"/>
One muſt be blind, <hi>added he,</hi> to be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of a firſt Principle, but one muſt be
<hi>Infinite like him,</hi> to be able to ſpeak exactly
of it; for ſince we know it is Incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
it naturally follows, that we can only
ſpeak of it by conjecture; and that all that
may be ſaid on the Subject, may perhaps
content the Curious, but can never ſatisfy
the Reaſonable Man. And we better approve of
an <hi>abſolute ſilence in the Matter,</hi> than to expoſe
our ſelves by putting off a many falſe Notions
concerning the Nature of a Being, which is
elevated ſo very much above our Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
We Aſſemble therefore together in the
<hi>Hab,</hi> only to acknowledge his Supream great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and adore his Soveraign Power, and leave
<hi>each Perſon to their liberty of thinking what they
pleaſe:</hi> But we have made an Inviolable Law,
never to ſpeak of him, for fear of engaging
our ſelves by diſcourſe in ſuch Errors as
might offend him. I leave it to the Learned
to judge of a Conduct ſo extraordinary as
this is, <hi>never to ſpeak in any manner of God.</hi>
All that I can ſay of it is, it impreſſes on the
Mind an admirable <hi>reſpect for Divine things,</hi> and
produces amongſt us ſuch an Union, of which
we meet with no Example any where elſe.
As I perceived the hour of <hi>Hab,</hi> would ſoon
oblige us to part, ſo I preſt him the more
earneſtly to tell me what were the Opinions
of the <hi>Auſtralians</hi> concerning the <hi>Nature of
the Soul;</hi> wherefore he explain'd to me their
Notions upon this Subject, but he did it in
ſo elevated a manner, that I could retain but
little that he ſaid to me of it, altho' whilſt
he was ſpeaking, I after ſome manner or other
apprehended all his Idea's.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:54359:48"/>
The moſt eſſential of their Opinions touching
Matter, as near as I can remember, runs upon
the Doctrine of an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Genius,</hi> which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates
it ſelf in part to each particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and which has the Vertue when any one
dies, of preſerving it ſelf, until it be communicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to another. So that this Genius is extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the death of any perſon, without being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd,
ſince it only waits for <hi>New Organs,</hi> and
the diſpoſition of a new Machine to rekindle it
ſelf, as I ſhall explain more at large, when I
ſhall ſpeak of their Philoſophy.</p>

               <p>I Have only three things to remark upon the
Sentiments of the <hi>Auſtralians</hi> concerning the
preſent Life: The firſt is in reſpect to the
beginning; the ſecond, the continuation thereof;
and the third, the end. Their manner of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
Life, preſerving and ending it.</p>
               <p>I have already declared, in what manner the
<hi>Australians</hi> come into the world; but as it is one
of the principal points of this Hiſtory, ſo I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
my ſelf obliged yet to ſay ſomething more
of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:54359:48"/>
They have ſo great an averſion for whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
regards the firſt beginning of their Lives,
that in a year or thereabouts after my arrival
amongſt them, two of the Brethren having heard
me ſpeak ſomething of it, with-drew from me,
with as many ſigns of horrour, as if I had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
ſome great Crime. One day when I had
diſcovered my ſelf to my Old Philoſopher, after
having cenſured me a little upon this Subject, he
entred into a long Diſcourſe, and brought many
Proofs to oblige me to believe, that Children
grew within them like Fruits upon the Trees;
but when he ſaw all his reaſons made no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
on my mind, and that I cou'd not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
ſmiling, he left me without accompliſhing
it, reproaching me that my incredulity proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the corruption of my manners.</p>
               <p>It happen'd another time, about ſix months af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
my arrival, that the extraordinary Careſſes of
the Brethren, cauſed ſome unruly mo<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ions in me,
which ſome of them perceiving, were ſo very much
ſcandaliz'd at it, that they left me with great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation:
Wherefore I ſoon became odious to
them all, as I have already ſaid; and they had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
deſtroy'd me, had it not been for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
aſſiſtance of this good Old man.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, in about thirty two years that I
have lived with them, I cou'd never learn their way
of Generation; yet be it as it will, their Children
have neither the <hi>Meazles</hi> nor <hi>Small Pox,</hi> nor other
the like accidents, which the <hi>Europeans</hi> are ſubject
unto.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as an <hi>Auſtralian</hi> had conceived, he quits
his Apartment, and is carryed to the <hi>Hab,</hi> where he
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:54359:49"/>
is received with Teſtimonys of an extraordinary
Bounty, and is nouriſhed without being oblig'd to
work. They have a certain high place, upon which
they go to bring forth their Child, which is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
upon certain <hi>Balſamick Leaves;</hi> after which the
Mother (or perſon that bore it) takes it and rubs
it with theſe Leaves, and gives it ſuck, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
appearance of having ſuffer'd any pain.</p>
               <p>They make no uſe of Swadling Cloaths, or Crad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les.
The Milk it receives from the Mother, gives
it ſo good nouriſhment, that it ſuffices it without
any other food for two years: And the Excrements
it voids, are in ſo ſmall a quantity, that it may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
be ſaid, it makes none. They generally ſpeak
at eight months; they walk at a years end, and at
two they wean them. They begin to reaſon at
three; and as ſoon as the Mother quits them, the
firſt Maſter of the firſt Company teaches them to
read, and at the ſame time inſtructs them in the
firſt Elements of a more advanced knowledge. They
uſually are three years under the Conduct of the
firſt Maſter, and after paſs under the Diſcipline of
the ſecond, who teaches them to write, with whom
they continue four years; and ſo with the others in
proportion, till they are thirty years of Age, at
which time they are perfect in all ſorts of Sciences,
without obſerving any difference amongſt them, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for Capacity, Genius, or Learning. When
they have thus accompliſh'd the courſe of all their
Studies, they may be choſe for Lieutenants, that is,
to ſupply the place of thoſe that wou'd leave this
Life.</p>
               <p>I have in the fifth Chapter ſpoken of their hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
which is mixt with a certain ſweetneſs full of
Gravity, that forms the temperament of the moſt
reaſonable men, and ſuch as are the fitteſt for So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:54359:49"/>
They are ſtrong, robuſt, and vigorous, and
their Health is never interrupted by the leaſt ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
This admirable Conſtitution comes without
doubt from their Birth and excellent Nouriſhment,
which they always take with moderation; for our
Sickneſſes are always the conſequences of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of that Blood whereof we are form'd, and
the exceſs of the ill Food which we are nouriſhed
with. In fine, our Parents generally communicate
to us all the defects that they have contracted by
their irregular Lives; their Intemperance fills us
with ſuch an abundance of ſuperfluous Humours,
which deſtroy us how ſtrong ſoever we may be, if
we purge not our ſelves often. It is the exceſſive
Heats that they kindle in their Blood by their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauches,
which cauſe in us ſuch Riſings in the Fleſh,
and all thoſe ſcorbutick Diſtempers which ſpread
throughout the whole Body. Their Choller gives
us a diſpoſition to the ſame Vice, their Wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
augments our Concupiſcence; in a word, they
make us juſt what we are, becauſe they give us
what they have.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Auſtralians</hi> are exempted from all theſe
Paſſions; for their Parents never being ſubject to
them, cannot communicate 'em; and as they have
no principle of alteration, ſo they live in a kind of
indifference which they never forſake, except it
be to follow the motions that their reaſon impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
on them.</p>
               <p>We may very near make the ſame conſequences
touching the nouriſhment of the <hi>Auſtralians;</hi> for if
the <hi>Europeans</hi> have the misfortune only to have
ſuch Viands for their ſubſiſtence as are unhealthful,
it commonly happens, that they eat more than na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
requires: and 'tis theſe exceſſes that cauſe in
them ſuch weak Stomachs, Feavers, and other the
like Infirmities which are wholly unknown to the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:54359:50"/>
                  <hi>Australians.</hi> Their admirable Temperance, and
the goodneſs of their Fruits, upon which they live,
maintains them in ſuch a frame of health, as is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
interrupted by any Sickneſs: They are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
ſo far from placing any glory in Eating, or
making ſumptuous Feaſts as we do, that they
hide themſelves, and only eat in ſecret; they ſleep
very little, becauſe they are perſuaded, that Sleep
is too Animal an Action, from which man ought
if it was poſſible, wholly to abſtain.</p>
               <p>They all agree, that this Life is only a motion
full of trouble and agitation; they are perſuaded,
that what we call Death is their Happineſs, and that
the greateſt good of Mankind is to arrive to this
term, which puts an end to all his pains: from
whence they are indifferent for life, and paſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
wiſh for Death. The more I ſeem'd to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
Death, the more they were confirm'd in
the thought that I cou'd be no man, ſince accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their Ideas, I ſinned againſt the <hi>firſt Princip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
of Reaſon.</hi> My Old man often times ſpoke to
me of it, and theſe are very near the ſame reaſons
he gave me; <hi>We differ from Beaſts,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>in that
their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings penetrate not into the bottom of
things, they judge of them only by Appearance and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.
'Tis from thence they fly their deſtruction, as the
greatest evil, and endeavour to preſerve themſelves as
the greateſt Good, not conſidering that ſince 'tis an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
neceſſity that they periſh; all the pains they take to
prevent it, becomes vain and uſeleſs. Even to argue,</hi>
continued he, <hi>upon what regards us, it is neceſſary,
that we ſhould conſider Life as an Eſtate of Miſery,
altho it conſist in the union of a ſpiritual Soul with a
material Body, whereof the Inclinations are perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
oppoſite the one to the other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:54359:50"/>
So that to deſire to live, is to deſire to be
always enduring the violent Shock of
theſe oppoſitions; and to deſire Death, is
but to aſpire to that Reſt, which each of
thoſe parts enjoys, when they are both
in their Center.</p>
               <p>And, as we have nothing <hi>Dearer to us,
than our ſelves,</hi> added he, nor can look
upon our ſelves to be any thing elſe, but
ſo many Compounds, whoſe Diſſolution
is certain and infallible, we more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<hi>languiſh than live;</hi> and the caſe
being ſo with us, would it not be better
for us not to be at all, than to be to no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
purpoſe, than to know, that ſhortly we
ſhall be no more? The care we take to
preſerve our ſelves, is to no purpoſe,
ſince after all, we muſt die at laſt. The
conſideration of our <hi>Rareſt Talents,</hi> and
moſt exquiſite improvements in Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
gives us a <hi>ſecond torment,</hi> ſince we
can look upon them as no other, than
Tranſitory Enjoyments, whoſe acquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
has coſt us a Thouſand pains, and yet,
whoſe loſs it is no way in our power to
prevent. <hi>In fine,</hi> all that we reflect upon,
both <hi>within and without</hi> us, contributes to
render our Life ſo much the more odious
and inſupportable to us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:54359:51"/>
I anſwered to all that, That in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
theſe Arguments proved too much;
and that to give them their full force, it
weuld follow, that I muſt needs be ſorry
for knowing any thing that ſurpaſſes my
Underſtanding, which yet is falſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<hi>the goodneſs of Judgment conſiſts in
being able to reſt content with our condition,</hi>
and to put away thoſe troubleſome
Thoughts that ſerve only to afflict us,
eſpecially when we know not how by any
means to remedy them. There is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of Solidity in thy anſwer, reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
he; but yet it is weak in two particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars:
The one is, in ſuppoſing we are
able to ſuſpend our Judgment; and the
other, in thinking it poſſible we ſhould
love our ſelves without deteſting our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution:
To be able to do the firſt, is
to be able, with open Eyes, not to ſee
what is continually before us; and to be
able to do the ſecond, is, to love to be
ſomething, without hating to be nothing.
'Tis a great weakneſs to imagine, we can
poſſibly live, without being deeply affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the Senſe of our own Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and 'tis ſtill a greater to torment our
ſelves with the fear of what we know
will infallibly come upon us: But it is
the <hi>utmoſt degree of folly,</hi> to ſeek after pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervatives,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:54359:51"/>
in order to avoid what we
know to be abſolutely inavoidable. To
be able to live without the Senſe of
Death, is to be able to live without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any thing of our ſelves, ſince Death
is inſeparable from our Nature; and that
to conſider our ſelves, in all our ſeveral
parts, is to ſee we have nothing but what
is mortal in us. To be capable of fearing
Death, ſuppoſes us able to reconcile two
Contradictions, ſince to fear, ſuppoſes
ſome doubt in us, whether what we fear
will happen or no, and that we certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
know we ſhall infallibly die, and it is
ſtill more abſurd to go about to take any
Preſervatives, to prevent it, when we
know that to be impoſſible. I replied,
That we might juſtly fear, not Death it
ſelf, but its Approaches; and that Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatives
were uſeful, becauſe they might at
leaſt ſtave it off from us for a while. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
good, replied he again, but doſt thou
not ſee, that ſince the neceſſity of dying
is indiſpenſible, and the putting it off for a
while, can be of no other ſervice to us,
than to keep us the longer under conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
pain, grief, and anguiſh. I anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him, that theſe Reaſons would be of
much more weight among our <hi>Europeans,</hi>
than among them who know not what it
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:54359:52"/>
is to ſuffer; whereas the Life of the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropeans</hi>
was nothing elſe but a <hi>continued
Chain</hi> of Miſeries and Sufferings.</p>
               <p>How, ſays he, have you any other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities
than thoſe of being <hi>Mortal,</hi> and
knowing your ſelves to be daily advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
towards Death? Yes, I aſſured him,
that our People commonly died <hi>many
Deaths,</hi> before they came to die for good
and all, and that Death came not upon
our <hi>Europeans,</hi> but by the Violence of
thoſe Diſeaſes that knockt them down,
and made them at laſt faint away under
them. This anſwer was to him a <hi>Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:</hi>
And as I was endeavouring to make
him comprehend our <hi>Gouts,</hi> our <hi>Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aches,</hi>
and our <hi>Colicks;</hi> I found he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
me not, and therefore to make him
apprehend my meaning, I was forced
particularly to explain to him the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of ſome of thoſe Diſeaſes we ſuffer;
which aſſoon as he underſtood, <hi>Is it
poſſible,</hi> cried he, <hi>that any one ſhould be in
love with ſuch a Life as that?</hi> I anſwered,
that our People did not only love it, but
uſed all manner of means to prolong it;
from whence he took a freſh occaſion to
condemn us, either for inſenſibility, or
extravagance, not being able, as he ſaid,
to conceive how a reaſonable Man that
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:54359:52"/>
was aſſured of his Death, and that ſaw
himſelf daily dying, by ſeveral ſorts of
Sufferings, and that could not protract
his Life, but in continual Languiſhment,
could poſſibly forbear deſiring Death, as
his greateſt happineſs. Our opinions, in
this matter, are vaſtly different, ſays he,
from yours: For we, aſſoon as we come
to underſtand our ſelves, becauſe we
think our ſelves obliged to love our own
ſelves, and look upon our ſelves, but as
ſo many <hi>Victims of a ſuperiour Cauſe,</hi> that
is able every moment to deſtroy us, we
therefore make very ſmall account of our
Life, and eſteem it but as a <hi>Happineſs,
which we can enjoy but as a Paſſenger,</hi> whilſt
it is fleeting and paſſing from us. The
time in which we enjoy it, is bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſome
to us, becauſe it ſerves for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but to raiſe in us a grief for the loſs
of that happineſs, which it more lightly
takes from us, than at firſt it gave it us.
In fine, We are weary of living, becauſe
we durſt not fix our <hi>Affection upon our ſelves
with all that tenderneſs,</hi> we might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
have, for fear of enduring too great
violences of Reluctance, when we ſhall
be forced to part from a being we have
ſo much doated on. To that I anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him, That Reaſon teaches us, that it was

                  <hi>always better to be, than not to be, and that
'twas better to live, tho' but for a day, than
never to live at all:</hi> To which he reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that we were to diſtinguiſh two things
in our Being; one was our general exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence,
that periſhes not, and the other
our particular Exiſtence, or <hi>Individuality</hi>
that periſhes. The firſt is indeed better
than privation, and that 'tis in that ſenſe,
'tis true; that being is preferable before
not being; but that the ſecond, <hi>viz.</hi> the
being of our <hi>Individuality,</hi> or particular be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is oftentimes worſe than not being,
eſpecially when tis accompanied with a
Knowledge that renders us unhappy. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
again, that if being in general
were better than not being, it muſt needs
follow, That being likewiſe in particular,
was better than its Privation: But he ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
me, by propoſing to me the very
State in which I had lately been. Tell
me, I prithee, ſays he, when thou conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deredſt
thy condition in the place of
which thou toldſt us, <hi>environned on all
ſides by Death;</hi> could thou poſſibly eſteem
thy Life at that time a Happineſs, and
could thou value it better than nothing?
Is it not true, that the Knowledge thou
hadſt, ſerved then only to <hi>augment thy
miſery?</hi> It is then to no purpoſe to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:54359:54"/>
that Knowledge that afflicts me, is
not only no Happineſs to me, but an
unhappineſs ſo much the more ſenſible,
as I know it the more perfectly: It is
from <hi>that principle that flows our true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery,</hi>
that we know what we are, and
what we muſt be, we know that we are
noble, and excellent beings: In a word,
worthy of an eternal Duration, and yet
we ſee that for all our Nobleneſs and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence,
we depend of a <hi>Thouſand other
Creatures,</hi> that are inferiour to us, which
is the cauſe we look upon our ſelves, as
bweings that were brought up only to be
rendered ſo much the more unhappy,
and that it is which makes us chuſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>not to be at all,</hi> than to be at the ſame
time ſo excellent, and ſo miſerable.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>Anceſtors</hi> were ſo ſtrongly perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of this Truth; that they <hi>ſought Death
with the greateſt paſſion</hi> in the World:
But becauſe by that means our Country
begun to grow deſolate, and diſpeopled,
reaſons were found out to perſwade thoſe
which remained, to ſpare themſelves for
ſome time: for it was repreſented to
them, that ſo very <hi>fine and ſpacious a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi>
ought not to be left uſeleſs; that we
are an <hi>Ornament of the Univerſe,</hi> and
therefore ought to endure Life, tho' it
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:54359:55"/>
were but to pleaſe that <hi>Soveraign Maſter</hi>
that gave it us. Upon which, ſome time
after, in order to Re-implace thoſe that
had ſought for Reſt in a voluntary Death,
all that remained alive, obliged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to preſent no leſs than <hi>three Children
to the Hebs;</hi> by which means, all the
Country being well Repeopled, an order
was publiſhed, that no Perſon ſhould
have permiſſion to go to his <hi>Long Reſt,</hi>
but ſuch a one who ſhould preſent another
Man to the <hi>Heb,</hi> either his own Son, or
another, who was willing to be his Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant,
and to ſupply his place; and it
was oreered, at the ſame time, that none
ſhould have the priviledge, neither to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
ſuch a Permiſſion, till he had liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at leaſt 100 Years, or could ſhew ſome
Wound that extreamly incommoded him.
Juſt as he had <hi>finiſhed</hi> thoſe words, we were
joyned by <hi>two Brethren,</hi> for which I was
very ſorry, becauſe I never found my
<hi>Old Man</hi> in ſo good a humour to diſcover
to me the <hi>Myſteries</hi> of all thoſe things,
of which I demanded of him ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</p>
               <p>And now to proceed with our <hi>Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
there never is held any <hi>Aſſembly</hi> at the
<hi>Heb,</hi> at which there is not twenty
or thirty Perſons that demand the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:54359:55"/>
to return to their reſt, and they never
refuſe any, be they who they will, that
produce juſt Reaſons for it: And when
any one has <hi>obtained Permiſſion to go out of
this Life,</hi> he preſents his Lieutenant, who
muſt be at leaſt 36 years of age. The
Company receives him with Joy, and
gives him the Name of the <hi>old Man</hi> that
has a Mind to die; which done, they
repreſent to him the brave actions of his
Predeceſſors, and tell him they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident,
he will not degenerate from the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of him, whoſe place he is going to
ſupply. When that <hi>Ceremony</hi> is over, the
<hi>old Man</hi> goes merrily to the Table, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
for that effect, with the <hi>Fruit of
Rest,</hi> where he eats to the number of
eight of them, with a ſmiling and calm
Countenance; when he has eaten <hi>Four</hi>
of them, his Heart begins to dilate, and
his Spleen to enlarge it ſelf; ſo that the
extraordinary joy he feels within him,
makes him commit ſeveral extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
as <hi>dancing, leaping,</hi> and <hi>talking</hi> all
manner of idle fooliſh things, which the
Brethren take no notice of, as coming
from a Man that has loſt his reaſon: then
they preſent him two more, that quite di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract
his Brain; after which, his Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and another Perſon conduct him
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:54359:56"/>
to the place, he before-hand choſe for a
<hi>Sepulchre,</hi> where they give him two more
of the aforeſaid Fruits, which plunge him
into an <hi>Eternal Sleep.</hi> Then they cloſe up
his Tomb, and return back, beſeeching
the <hi>Soveraign Being,</hi> to advance thoſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Moments, in which they may have the
Priviledge to enjoy the <hi>like Rest</hi> with their
departed Brother. In this manner are
the <hi>Auſtralians</hi> born, and thus they live
and die.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THE <hi>Auſtralians</hi> reckon their Years
from the <hi>firſt point of the Solſtice of
Capricorn,</hi> to the revolution of the ſame
Point, and they judge of it exactly by the
ſhadow of a Point faſtned to a Wall, and
oppoſed directly to the <hi>South:</hi> And when
that Shadow is come to the loweſt Point
in all their Appartments, then they know,
the Year is finiſhed. From that Point to
the Equinox in <hi>March,</hi> they count a <hi>Sueb,</hi>
or Month; from that Equinox again to
the <hi>Solſtice of</hi> Cancer, they count another
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:54359:56"/>
Month; from that time to the other E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinox,
they count a third Month; and
their fourth Month extends from that
Equinox to the Solſtice of <hi>Capricorn;</hi> ſo
that they have but <hi>four Months in the Year.</hi>
They call <hi>Suew</hi> what we call <hi>Weeks,</hi> and
reckon them by Moons; they divide the
Day (which they call <hi>Suec)</hi> into three
parts: The beginning of the Day they
call <hi>Mure;</hi> the middle part they call <hi>Dure,</hi>
and the latter part they call <hi>Spure.</hi> They
make no diviſion of the Night, becauſe
they paſs it wholly in <hi>profound Sleep,</hi> which
they procure by eating ſome <hi>R<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſting Fruits</hi>
before they go to Sleep, which lay them
ſo faſt, that nothing is able to wake them
ſo long as their Senſes remain benummed
by the vertue of thoſe Fruits. Their <hi>Mure</hi>
begins at Five in the Morning, and laſts
'till Ten; their <hi>Dure</hi> follows next, and
ends at Three in the Afternoon; and then
ſucceeds their <hi>Spure,</hi> which laſts 'till Eight
at Night. The firſt part of the Day is
employed for the <hi>Heb,</hi> and the Sciences;
the ſecond for Work; and the third for
<hi>publick Exerciſe.</hi> They go the <hi>Heb</hi> every
five Days; and this is the order they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
in it: The firſt Quarter paſſes the
<hi>Mure</hi> there, the ſecond the <hi>Dure,</hi> and the
third the <hi>Spure.</hi> The ſecond day, the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:54359:57"/>
fourth Quarter ſpends the <hi>Mure</hi> there, the
fifth the <hi>Dure,</hi> and the ſixth the <hi>Spure.</hi> The
third day ſucceeds in the ſaid three parts
of the day, the ſeventh, the eighth, and
the ninth; and the two following days
the reſt of the Quarters in the ſame or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
ſo that the ſixth day the firſt Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
begins again; not in the <hi>Mure,</hi> or Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
but in the <hi>Dure.</hi> By this means it
comes to paſs, That there are always 400
Perſons at the <hi>Hab,</hi> beſides thoſe of the
<hi>Hebs</hi> that follow their reſpective Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
Thus they paſs one third part of the
Day in the <hi>Hab,</hi> without ſpeaking one
Word, obſerving a ſteps diſtance between
perſon and perſon, and are all the while
ſo attentive upon what they are then think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon, that nothing is able in the leaſt
to diſtract their thoughts. I was told, They
formerly uſed to make ſome <hi>outward ſigns,</hi>
accompanied with wry Faces, and odd
poſtures of Body, but now they have
wholly aboliſh'd them, as unworthy of
reaſonable men to do. Thoſe days in
which they go not to the <hi>Hab,</hi> they are
obliged to be at the <hi>Heb,</hi> to treat <hi>of the
Sciences;</hi> which they do with an order and
method<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> moſt admirably plain, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
agreeing in all its parts. They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
every one in their turn all their <hi>diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,</hi>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:54359:57"/>
which they maintain with pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
Reaſons; after which, they anſwer
all the objections which their <hi>Antagoniſts</hi>
oppoſe againſt them. When the <hi>Diſpute</hi>
is ended, they, if any thing of Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
happen to have been propoſed,
they write it into the <hi>publick Book,</hi> and
every one carefully ſets it down too in
private. If any of them know any thing
that diſpleaſes him, or that he thinks
may be advantagious to his Country, he
propoſes it to the Brethren, who take
ſuch reſolutions thereupon, as they judge
moſt reaſonable, without aiming at any
thing but the publick Good.</p>
               <p>They employ the next third part of
their Day in their Gardens, which they
cultivate with ſuch art and skill, as is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
in <hi>Europe.</hi> They know how to
give ſuch an agreeable ſweetneſs to their
Fruits, by watering their Trees with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Liquors, that nothing can be eaten
more delicious than they. Their <hi>Flower-Pots</hi>
are enamell'd with a thouſand ſorts
of Flowers, of different beauties, that
ſeem to vie with one another in fineneſs
and variety of colours, and in the charms
of their perfuming ſmells. Their Walks
are longer than the Sight can reach, and
ſo neatly ordered, that nothing of that
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:54359:58"/>
nature can be more compleat. The whole
is cut through in all convenient places
with a thouſand different ſorts of Water-Works,
which are made into <hi>Baſons,
Chanels, Caſcades,</hi> and all that Art can
invent for the pleaſure of the Senſes, that
thoſe Gardens are thereby made ſuch
really, as we fancy them to be ſometimes
in Idea, when we let our Imagination
follow the dictates of our luxurious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires.</p>
               <p>The laſt third part of their Day is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted
for three ſorts of very diverting Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes;
the firſt conſiſts in producing
what they have newly invented, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating
the Experiments of what they
had already ſhewn; but there ſeldom
paſſes a day but they propoſe ſome new
Invention, upon which they always take
care to Regiſter the Name of the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
in their Book of publick Curioſities,
which they eſteem one of the greateſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
can be done them; and in 32 years
time, I obſerved above 5000 of theſe
new Inventions Recorded, that would
paſs for ſo many Prodigies among us.</p>
               <p>Their ſecond Exerciſe conſiſts in mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
two ſorts of Arms, one of which is
very like our Halberds, and the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles
much our Organ-Pipes. They uſe
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:54359:58"/>
the former with great agility, but yet not
with altogether ſo much dexterity as our
<hi>Europeans.</hi> Their Halberts are ſo maſſie
and ſtrong, that they will eaſily run
through the bodies of ſix Men, one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
another. They are made of ſix
pieces of Wood, ſeaſoned with Sea-water,
impregnated with ſome certain Drugs,
which render them very hard, and yet
very light. The other Arms which I have
compared to our Organ-Pipes, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
of ten or twelve Pipes, which are
furniſhed with certain Springs at one end,
which being let go, diſcharge Bullets
with ſo great a force, that they pierce
through the bodies of ſix Men, one after
another, at one ſhot, the action of which
Spring is ſo quick and rapid, that 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to fence off its blow, but men find
themſelves ſhot before they are aware
they were aimed at.</p>
               <p>As for their Halberts they exerciſe
them in throwing thirty or forty Paces,
and that ſo dextrouſly, that in fifteen
throws they ſeldom miſs twice of their
mark. But their Strength is much more
prodigious than their Art, for they
carry, without ſtraining themſelves, to
the weight of ſix or ſeven <hi>Quintals,</hi> or
hundred weight; and pull up Trees by
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:54359:59"/>
the Roots, which we could hardly ſhake;
&amp; I ſaw one of them, that after he had run
through, with his Halbert, four half men,
as they call us, carried them afterwards
upon one of his Shoulders, hanging upon
his Halbert, two before, and two be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind.</p>
               <p>Their third Exerciſe conſiſts in throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
certain Balls, of three or four different
ſizes, ſome of which they throw up into
the Air, and ſome at Butts, or Marks;
thoſe which they caſt into the Air, to be
well thrown, muſt hit one another in a
certain point mark'd out; and thoſe which
are caſt againſt Butts, muſt paſs through
a hole in the ſaid Butt, which they will
often do ten or twelve times together.
And that which is moſt to be remarked
in theſe Exerciſes, is, that they perform
them with much briskneſs and gayety,
which yet is tempered with a certain Air
of Gravity and Majeſty, without any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
or diſcompoſure of mind. The
Balls they throw one at another, are like
our <hi>Tennis-Balls,</hi> but ſofter, and leſs dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous:
and the Art of him that throws
them conſiſts in hitting him againſt whom
he plays: and his Adverſary on the other
ſide, places all his skill in avoiding the
ſtroke aimed at him; and the pleaſure of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:54359:59"/>
ſeeing them is ſo great, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but People will quit, to go to ſee ſuch
a Divertiſement. For ſometimes they ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pringly
leap backward, to let the Ball paſs
by them, and ſometimes they turn and
bend their bodies ſo many-ſeveral ways,
that there is no Rope-Dancer or Tumbler
among us can come near them for agility.
When he that throws the Ball, lets flie 3 or
4, one after another, it is an admirable
thing to ſee the dextrous behaviour of him
againſt whom they are directed, who
ſtoops to avoid the one, bends himſelf to
eſcape another, receives and throws back
the third and the fourth with his-hands,
and ſometimes with his feet; which ſeveral
actions he performs almoſt all in the ſame
inſtant; becauſe all the Balls being always
thrown very ſtraight, it neceſſarily hapens,
either that all of them hit, or that he at
whom they are aimed muſt uſe an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
dexterity in avoiding, or putting
them by. I was counted very dextrous in
<hi>Portugal,</hi> but yet I ſeemed very unhandy
among the <hi>Auſtralians;</hi> and had I not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
an excuſe, by reaſon of the wounds
I had received, I ſhould have made them
think my Nation to be very dull and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active
People.</p>

them to converſe together ſeveral hours,
without declaring their minds any other

when it is neceſſary to make continued

of Propoſitions: All their Words are <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſyllables,</hi>

and Compound Bodies, by the Vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
that ſignifie the chief Elements, of
which they are compoſed. They own
but five ſimple Bodies or Elements, of
which the firſt and nobleſt in their eſteem
is the Fire, which they expreſs by the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
Vowel <hi>A,</hi> the ſecond is the Air, which
they call <hi>E,</hi> the third is Salt, which
they call <hi>G,</hi> the fourth is Water, which
they call <hi>I,</hi> and the fifth is Earth, which
they call <hi>U.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All their Adjectives and their Epithets
are expreſſed by ſo many ſingle Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
of which they have a greater number
than the <hi>Europeans.</hi> Every Conſonant ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
a Quality that belongs to the things
ſignified by the Vowels: Thus <hi>B</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
Clear, <hi>C</hi> Hot, <hi>D</hi> Diſagreeable, <hi>F</hi> Dry:
and by theſe Explications they ſo perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from their words, that aſſoon as a
Man hears them pronounced, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
conceives the nature of things they
ſignifie; as for example, they call the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:54359:61"/>
Stars <hi>AeB,</hi> a word which ſignifies in one
Breath, the two chief Elements, or ſimple
Bodies, of which they are compoſed, and
withal, that they are Luminous. They call
the Sun <hi>Aab,</hi> the Birds <hi>Oef,</hi> which ſignifies at
once, that they are compoſed of a dry,
ſalt and airy ſubſtance. They call a Man
<hi>Vez,</hi> which ſignifies a ſubſtance, partly
airy, and partly Earthy, tempered with
ſome moiſture; the ſame method they
obſerve in the compoſition of other
Names. The advantage of this way of
ſpeaking is, that by this means a Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
a Philoſopher, by learning the firſt
words he pronounces, and that one can
name nothing at the ſame time, which
would paſs for a miraculous thing with
any one that knew not their Alphabet,
nor the compoſition of their words.</p>
               <p>And if their way of ſpeaking be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
their method of writing is much
more: they uſe only points to expreſs
their Vowels, which points are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd
only by their Situation. They
have Five places for them, the uppermoſt
ſignifying <hi>A,</hi> the ſecond <hi>E,</hi> and ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
As for example.</p>
               <p>A, E, I, O, U.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:54359:61"/>
And though it ſeems to us very difficult
to diſtinguiſh them, yet uſe has made it
very eaſie to them: they have 36 Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
24 of which are remarkable; they
are little ſtrokes that are made round
about the points, and ſignifie according
to the order of their ſeveral places; as for
example, <hi>E B</hi> ſignifies clear Air, <hi>I C</hi> Hot
Water, <hi>I X</hi> Cold Water, <hi>U L</hi> Moiſt
Earth, <hi>A F</hi> Dry fire, <hi>E S</hi> White Air,
and ſo all the reſt: they have about 18
or 19 more, which we have no Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
in <hi>Europe</hi> that can expreſs.</p>
               <p>The more we conſider that way of
writing, the more ſecrets we ſhall find
in it to admire. <hi>B</hi> ſignifies clear, or bright,
<hi>C</hi> hot, <hi>X</hi> cold, <hi>L</hi> moiſt, <hi>F</hi> dry, <hi>S</hi> white,
<hi>N</hi> black, <hi>T</hi> green, <hi>D</hi> diſagreeable, <hi>P</hi> ſweet,
<hi>Q</hi> pleaſant, <hi>R</hi> bitter, <hi>M</hi> deſirable, <hi>G</hi> evil,
<hi>Z</hi> high, <hi>H</hi> low, J conſonant red, <hi>A</hi> join'd
with 2, peaceable. Thus aſſoon as they
hear, or pronounce a word, they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
at the ſame time the nature of the
thing ſignified by it; as when they write
this word <hi>Ipin,</hi> they preſently underſtand
by it an Apple, both ſweet and delicious,
and <hi>Izd,</hi> a bad and diſagreeable Fruit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
When they teach a Child, they explain
to him all the Elements, and the nature
of all things ſignified by the words he
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:54359:62"/>
pronounces. Which is of wonderful ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
as well to the publick, as to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
perſons: becauſe as ſoon as they
know how to read, which is commonly
at three years old, they apprehend at the
ſame time the Properties of all manner of
Beings. They attain to perfection in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
at ten years; and are skilled in all
the Secrets of their Letters at fourteen.
They underſtand all the difficulties of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy
at twenty, and from twenty, to
twenty five, they apply themſelves to the
contemplation of the Stars; and they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
that Study into three parts; the firſt
concerns the Revolution of the Stars, the
ſecond, their diſtinction, and the third,
their qualities, with their Reaſonings
thereupon, which are quite different from
thoſe of our <hi>Europeans,</hi> upon that Subject.
But this being a Matter purely Philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
it is no proper place here to enter into
any particular explication of it.</p>
               <p>From twenty five till twenty eight
years of Age, they imploy themſelves in
ſtudying the Hiſtory of their Country;
and 'tis only in that one point they ſhew
a weakneſs of mind, like to that of other
People, as well in reſpect of the great
Antiquity to which they extend their
Original, as of the fabulous things they
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:54359:62"/>
relate of the firſt Men from which they
pretend themſelves deſcended. For they
count above 12000 Revolutions of Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices
ſince the beginning of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick.
They pretend to derive their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal
from <hi>HAAB,</hi> that is, a God, who,
they ſay, produced three Men, from
whom all the reſt deſcended. They have
ſome Records written upon old Barks of
Trees, that contain 8000 Revolutions of
their Hiſtory, which are written in the
form of Annals; the reſt is comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in 48 Volumes, of a prodigious big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
but all that is reported in them, has
more of the appearance of Romantick
Prodigies, than of real hiſtorical Events,
and is more wonderful than credible. For
if all they relate be true, the Stars are
multiplied by two thirds more than they
were at firſt; the Sun grown bigger by
one half; and the Moon on the contrary,
ſhrunk much leſs; the Sea has changed
its place; and a thouſand other like things
have happened contrary to all appearance
of probability.</p>
               <p>As for us <hi>Europeans,</hi> and the reſt of
Mankind, they make our Race to begin
not 'till 5000 Revolutions after them, and
the Original which they give us, is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:54359:63"/>
Ridiculous; for they Report, <hi>That
a Serpent of an unmeaſurable bigneſs, and of
an amphibious nature, which they call</hi> Ams,
<hi>throwing himſelf upon a Woman, while ſhe
was aſleep, and having enjoyed her, without
doing her any other miſchief, the Woman
waking towards the end of the action, was
ſtruck with ſuch a horror at it, that in a
fright ſhe threw her ſelf into the Sea; but that
the Serpent leaping in after her, ſwam by her,
and keeping her above water, carried her to a
neighbouring Iſland, where the Woman re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
her fright, and being moved with
the ſtrange friendſhip ſhown her by that Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,
repented of her deſpair, and was wrought
upon to uſe all endeavours to preſerve her life,
and accordingly ſought about that Deſart for
all that might contribute to her Nouriſhment;
and the Serpent on his ſide, brought her all he
could find. At laſt this Woman was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
of two Children, the one a Boy, and the
other a Girl. Upon which the Serpent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled
bis care, and never ceaſed going up
and down to look for Proviſions to feed the
Mother and the Children; and when he could
not meet with the Fruits which they ordinarily
fed upon, he would take Fiſh, and ſometimes
ſmall Animals<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and bring them to eat. But
as thoſe Children grew up, they ſhewed every
day more and more viſible marks of malice</hi>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:54359:63"/>
                  <hi>and brutality, which ſo grieved the Mother,
that nothing could appeaſe her ſorrow. The
Serpent thereupon taking notice of her trouble,
and thinking ſhe pined after her own Country,
after he had endeavoured to comfort ber with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any effect, he made her underſtand by
ſigns, that if ſhe had a mind to return to her
own Country People, he was ready to aſſiſt
her in her return, as he had done in bringing
her where ſhe was now. Upon this, the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
threw her ſelf into the Water, more out
of deſign to try the good will of the Serpent,
than out of any other motive; at the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
the Serpent leapt after, and holding her
faſt imbraced under him, carried her back
in a few hours into her own Country; after
which he return<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d back to his two young Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
who when they were grown up, coupled

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y: And when the Iſland, hy this means,
grew over-ſtock'd with People, they found out
a way to tranſport themſelves into<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> other
Countries, and to fill them with their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions,
together with all thoſe diſorderly
qualities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and their pernicious effects, that are
experienced in all Countries peopled by that
Serpentine Race.</hi> And this is the goodly
Pedigree the <hi>Auſtralians</hi> are pleaſed to
give us; but to return to them.</p>
               <p>

When they come to the Age of thirty
years, they are priviledged to argue upon
all ſorts of Subjects, excepting that of
<hi>Haab,</hi> that is, GOD: When they are
thirty five years old, they are capable of
being made Lieutenants in their <hi>Hebs,</hi> and

little verſed in the knowledge of
Foreign Countries, but knows there are
ſome peculiar Animals in them as diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from thoſe of other Regions, as the
Lands that bear them. As for Example,
<hi>England</hi> breeds no Wolves; nor can any
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:54359:64"/>
Serpents live in <hi>Ireland,</hi> let them be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported
from what other place ſoever.
The Woods and Foreſts of the ſame
Country are infeſted neither with Worms
nor Spiders. The Iſles of the <hi>Orcades</hi> have
no Flies; <hi>Candia</hi> has no venemous Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
and Poiſon it ſelf, when tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into the Iſles of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> loſes its
venome, and is no longer mortal when
in thoſe Countries.</p>
               <p>It is certain, that the biggeſt Animals
are not always the moſt hurtful; and
thoſe ſmall Vermine, which the <hi>Austra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi>
can hardly tell how to conceive,
though they have nothing rare in them
but their life, yet do ſo much miſchief in
divers parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> that they often
cauſe Famine, Plague, and other conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Calamities, as might be proved
by infinite number of experiences; for
which reaſon I muſt needs reckon it to
be one of the greateſt happineſſes of the
<hi>Auſtralians,</hi> that they are exempted from
all manner of Inſects. There is not to be
found any venomous Beaſt in all their
Countrey; and therefore they often lie
down, and ſleep on the bare ground, not
only without any danger, but with great
pleaſure: And 'tis from thence they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
gather a great part of thoſe fair and
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:54359:65"/>
delicious Fruits that there abound. They
uſed for a long time, to keep three ſorts
of four-footed Beaſts, and they ſtill keep
ſo many ſorts in ſeveral parts: The leaſt
of them may be compared to our Apes,
but their Faces are not hairy, their Eyes are
even with their Head, their Ears are pretty
long, and their Mouth and Noſe are like a
Man's. They have longer Claws than other
Apes, with five Fingers each<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with which
they hold and carry what they will, with
as much eaſe and dexterity as Men. They
are very active, and turn their bodies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a great many poſtures, that require as
much dexterity as agility: The love they
have to Men is ſo great, that they will
ſtarve themſelves, and die for grief, if
they be ſeparated from them. When
they are in the preſence of any Man, they
never ceaſe giving him all the divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
they can, by their various Motions
and Poſtures. They are now baniſht out
of a great many <hi>Sezains,</hi> becauſe they
were too troubleſome, and particularly in
their Religious Aſſembly in the <hi>HAB;</hi>
for as they could not keep them from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thither without locking them up, and
running the risk of finding them dead with
pining, when they came home; ſo on the
other ſide, they could not let them go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:54359:65"/>
without expoſing themſelves to be
continually diſturbed at their devout Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations,
and without a viſible Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanation
of ſo venerable a place. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals
of the ſecond ſort, are ſomething
like our Hogs, ſave only that their Hair
is as ſoft as Silk, and their Snouts are long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
by half than thoſe of Swine. They
call them Hums; they have the inſtinct
to work, and turn up the Earth in right
lines, with as much, or more dexterity
than our beſt Husbandmen, and have no
need of any Leader, to guide them in
beginning, continuing, and ending their
furrows; yet they have deſtroyed them
in moſt of the <hi>Sezains,</hi> becauſe of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtineſs
they fill all places with, and becauſe
they are uſeful but ſeven or eight days in
a year; and that they muſt be kept ſhut
up all the reſt of the year, to prevent the
dammages, and diſtaſtful annoyances they
will otherwiſe cauſe.</p>
               <p>The third ſort of Animals are like our
<hi>Dromedaries,</hi> ſave only that their Heads
are more like thoſe of Horſes, their Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bones
are ſunk inwards their whole length,
and the Birds that are raiſed above it, form
a kind of Heart, whoſe point is turned
downwards, in the upper hollow of which,
two Men may eaſily lie down; theſe
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:54359:66"/>
Beaſts are called <hi>Suefs,</hi> and will carry
with eaſe eight Men of that Country, that
weigh at leaſt as much as twelve <hi>Europeans,</hi>
and they are uſed likewiſe for the carriage
of heavy Burdens, and of ſuch things as
are moſt neceſſary in the Commerce of
Life.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe Animals, there are four
ſorts of Birds, which well deſerve our
Reflection; the firſt are called <hi>Effs,</hi> who
flutter about like tame Hens, and are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
their bigneſs; they are of a charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Carnation Colour, however they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
now to baniſh them out of the <hi>Sezains,</hi>
becauſe they do a great deal of miſchief
in the Flower-pots and Gardens.</p>
               <p>The ſecond and third ſorts are like
our <hi>Tom-Tits,</hi> and <hi>Yellow-Hammers,</hi> but a
little bigger; and ſo tame, that they are
often fain to drive them away forcibly off
from Peoples bodies; and their Voices
are ſo ſweet, that they are preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the ſweeteſt Conſorts of Muſick;
they flutter about the Brethren, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
them every where; they go into the
very <hi>Hab,</hi> where they cauſe a certain
chearfulneſs and calmneſs of Spirit, by
their chirping, which they call <hi>Pacd,</hi>
that is to ſay, Divertiſement of Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
They never eat but with the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:54359:66"/>
nor take any reſt but when they
are perched ſomewhere upon them.
And they have this property, that they
ſmell the Birds of Prey at a great diſtance,
and peck the Brethren to give them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of it. The fourth ſort of Birds are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the bigneſs of our <hi>Oxen;</hi> they have
a long-pointed Head, and a Bill of a full
foot long, and ſharper than a <hi>Razor;</hi> they
have right <hi>Bullocks</hi> Eyes ſtanding out of
their Heads, two great Ears, Red and
White Feathers, a Neck, not ſlender, but
very large, a Body twelve Foot long, and
four Foot broad, with a Tale turning up,
and furniſhed with long Feathers, a Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
under their Feathers as hard as Iron,
and of proof againſt all blows; and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
they have Feet, rather ſlender than
thick, that are armed with five horrible
Talons, ſtrong enough to hold and carry
off with eaſe 300 weight: Theſe horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Birds are called <hi>Urgs,</hi> and live only by
Prey. And accordingly at certain ſet ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
they make ſo cruel a War upon the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtralians,</hi>
that they ſometimes carry off 4 or
500 of them in a day: Aſſoon as they
have taſted of Man's fleſh, their Greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
after it ſo mightily encreaſes, that
they omit no Stratagem or Invention to
get more of it; for ſometimes they place
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:54359:67"/>
themſelves down from the middle Region
of the Air twelve or fourteen of them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and throwing themſelves croſs the
Arms of the <hi>Auſtralians,</hi> ſeldom fail to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
off every one his Man. As theſe Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
are the greateſt Enemies the <hi>Auſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi>
have, they have uſed, and ſtill daily
uſe incredible Endeavours to exterminate
them, ſo far as to have deſtroyed whole
Iſlands of 30, and 35 Leagues compaſs,
and raiſed Mountains of a League high,
to drive them away: but in ſpight of all
they have yet done, or can do, I ſee no
likelihood they will ever be able to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
themſelves from them: For the
Iſlands where they harbour are ſo nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
in that Country, and are ſo full of
ſuch vaſtly high Rocks, that it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
ever to deſtroy them: But we ſhall
ſpeak more amply of theſe Birds in the
next Chapter.</p>
               <p>I cannot forbear telling you here, that
the <hi>Auſtralians</hi> are ſo far from eating fleſh,
that they cannot conceive how any Man
can find in his Heart to do it; the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
they alledge for it, are, firſt, that ſort
of Nouriſhment cannot agree with Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,
that ought naturally to be averſe
from all cruelty: ſecondly, becauſe the
fleſh of Animals very much reſembling
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:54359:67"/>
that of Men, it follows, that they which
can have the Stomach to eat of the fleſh
of the former, will eaſily be induced to
eat without difficulty of the latter two:
thirdly, becauſe the digeſtion of it is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
and we cannot eat the fleſh of an
Animal, without contracting ſome of its
Inclinations: fourthly, becauſe the fleſh
of a Brute is ſo modified for that Brute's
Nature, that we cannot eat of it, without
becoming proportionably more or leſs
like that Brute, as we eat more or leſs of
its fleſh: fifthly, becauſe a Beaſt is a thing
ſo much beneath us, that it were better
for a Man not to be at all, than to debaſe
his noble nature, ſo far as to adulterate
it with the mixture of that of a Beaſt, by
making it his Food. The <hi>Auſtralians</hi>
likewiſe hate Fiſh, no leſs than Land-Creatures,
and there are but very few to
be ſeen in their Seas or Rivers, becauſe
the Birds of Prey we juſt now mentioned,
feed upon them, and make a continual
War upon them: And for my part I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
eat any other Fiſh there but a certain
ſort of <hi>Eels</hi> of three or four Ells long, and
ſome ſmall finny-footed Creature, like
our <hi>Hedge hoggs,</hi> of a Colour as black as
Ebony.</p>

four of thoſe advantages which we

               <p>Among the Beaſts that I have deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
the <hi>Hums</hi> would render us ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

men of the extraordinary pains they are
fain to take in digging and plowing up
the Earth; but the <hi>Suefs</hi> would prove

for they are Beaſts more gentle and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable
than Oxen, and may be kept ſo
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:54359:68"/>
cheap, that two pounds of Graſs or Herbs
will keep one of them three Days. They
can endure a whole Day without eating,
and in the moſt difficult Journies, they
will travel 18 or 20 Leagues out-right,
without any need of ſtopping to bait. It
is eaſie to gueſs what profit the Merchants
would get by theſe Creatures, for they
would not need to be at the tenth part
of the charge they now are at for the
carriage of their Goods, two of theſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals
being able to carry as much as a
large Waggon drawn by ſix Horſes. The
<hi>Auſtralians,</hi> that have no need of any
Traffick, are excuſable for making no
more account of theſe Beaſts, but the
<hi>Europeans</hi> would find it worth their while
to get ſome of them brought over, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
price they coſt. But yet all this is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to the gain the <hi>Europeans</hi> might draw
from thoſe Birds of Prey of which I have
ſpoken; for thoſe Birds, though they are
very cruel when wild, yet may be tamed,
and made as gentle as any of our moſt
<hi>domeſtick Animals.</hi> When I came firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Australia,</hi> they had one of them which
they kept in one of the <hi>Sezains,</hi> that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
a Man on his back with more eaſe
than a <hi>Spaniſh Courſer.</hi> They are to be
mounted behind their Wings, and the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:54359:69"/>
Feathers on their Back ſupply the place of
a very commodious Cuſhion; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of a Bridle, one need but tie a
piece of Whipcord about their Bills, with
which one may guide them whither and
how one pleaſes. In this manner a man
may travel forty or fifty Leagues out right,
and then after about two Hours reſting to
bait, he may go as many more; and ſo
he may eaſily travel 100 Leagues a day,
without any incommodity, without fear,
without danger, and without being trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with the oppoſition of Rivers, Woods,
Mountains, or any other obſtacle, or ill
rencounter in his way. But two Reaſons,
however, obliged the <hi>Auſtralians</hi> to leave
off the uſe of them, which would be of
no force in <hi>Europe.</hi> The firſt, is becauſe
thoſe Birds are extremely hot with Luſt,
after carnal Conjunction, which was the
cauſe that ſometimes they would carry
their <hi>Auſtralian</hi> Riders into ſome <hi>Iſland,</hi>
where they ſmelt a Female of their kind,
where they were devoured by the wild
Birds. The ſecond, was becauſe they
were perſuaded, that the tame Birds of
that kind were the chief occaſion that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed
the wild ones to come in ſuch num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
into their Country, where they made
ſuch havock. Which conſiderations could
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:54359:69"/>
have no place in our <hi>Northern Countries,</hi>
whither none would be tranſported but
tame ones, and where there would be no
wild ones at all.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the moſt conſiderable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks
I have made upon the Animals of
the <hi>Southern Countries.</hi> Next, as for the
Fruits it bears, they ſurpaſs all imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in beauty and deliciouſneſs: The
Fruit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which they call <hi>the Fruit of Reſt,
or Repoſe,</hi> is indued with ſome properties
that to us would appear miraculous. Its
faculty in procuring Reſt when we pleaſe,
and the vertue of its Juice in healing, in
very little time, all manner of wounds,
induce me to believe there's no Ail, or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper
in <hi>Europe,</hi> for which it would not
prove a ſoveraign Remedy. I was infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
afterward, that it was with that all
my wounds were cured, I had received
at my coming; and though I afterward
received in ſeveral Fights many ſore blows
more, ſome whereof made great wounds
in my body and ſome broke and ſhattered
my bones, yet by vertue of that only
Juice, I was always cured in three days<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which if known, and uſed in <hi>Europe,</hi> would
cut ſhort <hi>that numherleſs number of Drugs
and Remedies,</hi> that coſt ſo dear among us,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:54359:70"/>
and which yet after all, <hi>kill more Patients
than they cure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>While I lived in <hi>Portugal,</hi> I was ſubject
to ſeveral Infirmities, and the terrible
ſhocks I had ſuffered by my diſaſters up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Sea, had very much weakned me;
and yet when I came into <hi>Auſtralia,</hi> and
began to live upon the Fruits of the
Earth, that are the only Food there, I
can boldly affirm, That I felt not the
leaſt Indiſpoſition, nor Infirmity; and tho'
my abſence at ſuch a dreadful diſtance
from my own Country, and the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
odd and ſtrange Cuſtoms of the
People I converſed with, and which I
was obliged to conform to, gave me no
ſmall cauſe to be <hi>Melancholick,</hi> and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
me with many a bitter reflection,
yet as ſoon as I taſted but one of the <hi>Fruits
of Repoſe,</hi> all my Reſentments were calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and my Courage and uſual briskneſs
came to me again, my Blood danced in
my Veins, and I found my ſelf in ſuch a
diſpoſition both of body and mind, that
there was nothing I could deſire to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
my Contentment more compleat than
it was. Of what ineſtimable price would
ſuch <hi>Fruits</hi> be in <hi>Europe,</hi> where grief and
vexation kill the greateſt part of mankind,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:54359:70"/>
and troubles cauſe languiſhments far
worſe, and far more formidable than
Death.</p>
               <p>But can there be any thing imagined
more deſirable, than to live ſplendidly
and fare very delicately, without being
at any charge, ſince for that end, one
need not have any greater Proviſion than
three or four of thoſe Fruits, which are
incomparably more delicate, and of a
much richer Reliſh and Nouriſhment,
than our moſt ſucculent Meats, and
moſt artfully ſeaſoned Diſhes, nor any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Drink, than a ſort of natural <hi>Nectar,</hi>
that is found running in ſtreams in that
Country, where every one may eat and
drink his fill, with the greateſt Pleaſure
in the World, without being obliged, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to Till the Earth, or cultivate any
Trees.</p>
               <p>I have admired an hundred times how
Nature comes to be ſo partially liberal to
that Country, to give away as 'twere in
ſporting, and with a careleſs prodigality
thoſe things ſhe is ſo nigardly of in our
Regions. But among other things, I
cannot paſs in ſilence, that abundance of
fine Cryſtal that is there to be found,
and which the <hi>Auſtralians</hi> know how,
with ſuch admirable Skill and Symmetry
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:54359:71"/>
to cut, and put together, that it is very
hard to find where the Stones joyn, ſo
exactly they ſeem to be all of a piece.
This Cryſtal is ſo tranſparent, that 'twere
impoſſible to diſtinguiſh any Po<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>es in it,
if the rich Figures Nature forms in it of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
colours, did not convince us it had
ſome.</p>
               <p>But that, which in my Opinion ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
all the moſt prodigious Rarities in the
World, is a <hi>Hab,</hi> which is to be ſeen in
the <hi>Seizain,</hi> or diſtrict of <hi>Haf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> which is
made all out of one entire piece of Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal,
which could not be done, but by
cutting it out of a great Rock of the
ſame matter. This wonderful <hi>Hab<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> or
<hi>Temple,</hi> ſurpaſſes all the reſt in height and
breadth; for it is 200 Foot high, and 150
Foot wide; the Figures with which this
Cryſtal is interſperſed, are bigger than
thoſe obſerved in the other, and it is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
that they are all entire, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
patched up with any inlaid pieces:
They aſſured me, that it had been oftentimes
debated among them, whether it
would not be better to deſtroy it, than
to keep it ſtanding, becauſe it tempts the
curioſity of thoſe that dwell afar off, and
cauſes diſtraction of Thoughts in them
that aſſemble in it: However it is yet
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:54359:71"/>
ſtanding, and I can hardly believe that
ever they can find in their Hearts' to vote
the demolition of ſo rich and rare a
piece as that.</p>
               <p>The greateſt difficulty I find in procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
a Traffick in theſe Commodities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Auſtralia,</hi> conſiſts in
finding out ſome way, either to force, or
otherwiſe to diſpoſe of ſuch a Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;
for after having well conſidered
the whole matter, there appear to me
unſurmountable difficulties in ſuch an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe;
for the <hi>Auſtralians</hi> being a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that neither cover any thing; there is
no likelihood of bringing them to a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance,
by the allurements of Gain, of
Rewards, or of Pleaſure, nor any practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
means left for us to overcome that
ſtrange averſion they have for us, which
is ſo great, that they cannot endure to
hear us mentioned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without declaring the
paſſion they have to deſtroy us. And
then beſides all thoſe things that we uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
carry into the new diſcovered Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
and which procures us acceſs to their
Inhabitants, paſs in the eſteem of the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtralians,</hi>
for Childrens Play-things, and
meer trifles, and bawbles; they look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our Gawdy Stuffs, and richeſt Silks,
as Spiders Webs, they know not ſo much
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:54359:72"/>
as what the names of Gold or Silver ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie;
and in a word, all that we count
precious appear in their eſteem to be but
ridiculous; and therefore there remains
no other way to introduce our ſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, but by open force; and in
that matter they have a great advantage
over us, which would fruſtrate all our
attempts that way; for the Sea in thoſe
parts is ſo very ſhallow, that it will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
carry a Boat, at two or three Leagues
diſtance from their Shoars, unleſs it be in
certain particular <hi>Creeks,</hi> where there are
ſome Veins of Water which cannot be
known, but by long experience. Beſides
all which obſtacles, they keep ſo exact a
Guard upon all their Coaſts, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to ſurpriſe them, nor yet to attack
them with any hopes of Succeſs, as will
appear by the following Relation of ſome
of their Wars.</p>

of thoſe <hi>Foreign Nations,</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſenſible of the advantages wherewith
it is bleſſed, make all poſſible efforts to
open themſelves a way into it. The moſt
formidable of all thoſe <hi>Neighbouring Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
are the <hi>Fondins,</hi> a fierce and warlike
People, who are always ready to make
an Irruption upon them, in thoſe parts
where they are leaſt expected. Which
obliges the <hi>Auſtralians</hi> to keep ſeveral
Thouſand Men continually in Arms, to
guard the Shoars, and the Avenues of the
Mountains next the <hi>Sea,</hi> where they have
conſtantly upon Guard 20000 Men in
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:54359:73"/>
the Compaſs of about ſixty Leagues of
Country.</p>
               <p>The firſt of thoſe Guards that diſcovers
an Enemy approaching<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> immediately
gives the ſignal agreed upon; which ſignal
conſiſts in throwing up a kind of flying
Squib or Serpent, that flies very high, and
makes a noiſe to be heard two Leagues;
upon which, all the reſt to the right and
left hand, give the ſame Signals, ſo that
in 24<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hours, all the Coaſt takes the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm,
and the half of the Guards run to
the place where the Alarm began, with
ſuch celerity, that in leſs than ſix Hours
time, there will aſſemble between 30. and
40000 Men; and when they find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſtrong enough to repulſe the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
they take away the firſt Signal, upon
which, all the reſt ceaſe, and no more
Succours march up to them.</p>
               <p>But that which ſeems to me moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
in them, is to ſee them without
any Commanders to lead them, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
having any previous Diſcourſe or
Communication one with another, or
receiving any Direction or Inſtruction;
they know how to poſt themſelves with
ſo much Order and Diſcipline, that one
would think they were all ſo many admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:54359:73"/>
all inſpired with the ſame deſign, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
upon the means how to execute it.</p>
               <p>I aſſiſted againſt two Irruptions, made
by the <hi>Fondins</hi> into the Country. The
firſt was made about 17 Years after my
Arrival in the Country, and the other
was made the laſt year of my ſtay there.
The <hi>Fondins</hi> aſſembled an Army of about
100000 Men, and attempted to break
through a Paſſage that was not ſo watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
guarded as the reſt, 30000 of them
were already paſſing by favour of the
Night; and had it not been for the indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
of ſome hot-headed Fools among
them that made a great noiſe, they had all
entred into the Country, before the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtralians</hi>
could have perceived them; but
that noiſe having betrayed them, the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtralians</hi>
ſeeing the extream danger,
which they were in, doubled their ſignals,
in which caſe all the <hi>Sezains</hi> are bound to
take Arms, and march with all Expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on to their Aſſiſtance; yet the <hi>Fondins,</hi>
who poared in in throngs, met with but
300 <hi>Australians,</hi> that firmly oppoſed them;
but they did it ſo vigorouſly, that they put
a ſto<gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> for a conſiderable while to a Party

                  </gap> Enemies; but at laſt, being ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
on every ſide by the reſt of them
that were gotten further into the Country,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:54359:74"/>
they were all cut in pieces: But howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
by ſelling their Lives ſo dear, and
keeping the Enemy in play for above Two
Hours, they gave the two <hi>Sezains</hi> time to
come up with them; ſo that while the
reſt were juſt defeated, another freſh Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of about 1500 Men was drawn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to diſpute their paſſage any further;
the <hi>Fondins</hi> having paſſed over the Bellies
of the firſt Party, threw themſelves into
the Country, to the number of above
60000, crying out, <hi>Ham, Ham,</hi> which in
their Tongue, is <hi>Victory, Victory.</hi> Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
which, the 1500 <hi>Auſtralians</hi> kept
themſelves in a Body as firm as a Rock,
forming a front on all ſides of them; but
the <hi>Fondins</hi> ſurrounding them at laſt, made
a moſt horrible ſlaughter of them.</p>
               <p>In the mean while the day began to
break, and a Party of the <hi>Fondins,</hi> being
obſtinately ſet upon, defeating the ſaid
1500 <hi>Auſtralians,</hi> kindled Fires round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them, either to burn them, or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

reſt of the <hi>Auſtralians</hi> which cam<gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
thither from all parts, formed at laſt
a Body of 25000 Men, among whom I
was; and dividing themſelves into three
parts, and leaſt of them, which conſiſted
of between 5 and 6000 Men, endeavoured
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:54359:74"/>
to ſeize the paſſage, by which the <hi>Fondins</hi>
made their Irruption; the <hi>Fondins</hi> appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive
of ſuch a Deſign, had left 20000
Men to guard it, who charged the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtralians</hi>
with ſo much fury for five Hours
together, that they would have totally
defeated them, if it had not been for a
Re-inforcement of 3000 Men, who came
in, and maintained the Fight five Hours
longer, with a horrible Slaughter on both
ſides: During which time, the two other
Bodies fought with the ſame Vigour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the reſt of the <hi>Fondins,</hi> and the But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery
was ſo great in that place, that the
Field of Battle was become like a Maſh of
Mortar, compoſed of Earth and Blood, in
which the Combatants ſunk up to the Knees;
and the <hi>Fondins,</hi> however, began already to
grow weary, when a new Reinforcement
of 20000 <hi>Auſtralians</hi> arrived; who having
forced their way without much oppoſition
through the <hi>Fondins,</hi> joyned our Troops:
And now, finding our ſelves much ſtronger
than our Enemies, we detached away
10000 Men to the aſſiſtance of our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
at the paſſage, a great many of
which were already knockt on the Head
by the <hi>Fondins,</hi> with great Stones, which
they threw down at them from the tops of
the Mountains, where they lay im Ambu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcade.
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:54359:75"/>
On our ſide, we having freſh
Troops, renewed a fierce Fight againſt
Men that were already almoſt ſpent,
which quickly forced them to give way,
and betake themſelves to flight; but when
they ſaw the paſſage ſhut up againſt them,
and that they were inevitably loſt, they
turned back upon us that were purſuing
their Rear, and fighting like deſperate
Men, opened themſelves a paſſage thro'
our Troops, which were weary of killing
them.</p>
               <p>And having thus forced their way thro'
us, they began to fly in diſorder croſs the
Country, diſperſing themſelves on this
ſide, and that ſide, in the wide Fields.
The Fight laſted till the middle of the
next Night; and as the <hi>Auſtralians</hi> that
ſtill were marching with freſh Reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
from all parts, met every where in
their paſſage ſome flying <hi>Fondins,</hi> ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
themſelves with a great deal of
Bravery; but as ſoon as they perceived
the approach of this new Reinforcement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
they turned their backs, and fled. When
the Fight was over, the <hi>Auſtralians</hi> that
had fought, refreſht and reſted themſelves,
and the reſt took care to perform the laſt
Duties to the Brethren, who were killed
in the Battle: They found above 19000
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:54359:75"/>
                  <hi>Auſtralians</hi> killed upon the place, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
12000 were wounded, in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of which, I may reckon my ſelf, ſince
I had an Arm broke, and one of my
Thighs run through: Each one knew
the Dead that belonged to him, and had
them carried back to their reſpective
Quarters. The neceſſary orders were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
given to convey all the Bodies of the
<hi>Fondins,</hi> to the place where they had
made their Irruption; and they found
of them above 90000, which they piled
up one upon another.</p>
               <p>Thus paſſed the firſt Battle of the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtralians</hi>
againſt the <hi>Fondins,</hi> at which I
was preſent, and which I accordingly
deſcribe, as an Eye-witneſs: I could not
perceive they obſerved any other Rule
on our ſide in their fighting, except it
were to reſolve to let themſelves be killed,
than to ſuffer their Ranks to be broken:
As for their defenſive Armour, they wear
a ſort of light Back and Breaſt Plate, as
thin as Paper, but yet ſo hard, that no
blows that are not ſtruck at them with an
extraordinary vigour, are able to pierce
them. As for their Proviſions for the
Mouth, on ſuch occaſions, they are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
every one in particular, from the
reſpective Quarter, or diſtrict, to which
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:54359:76"/>
he belonged, the Brethren carrying them
to their <hi>Hab</hi> in the Morning, and the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
of the next <hi>Hab</hi> carrying them to
theirs, and then thoſe of the next to theirs,
and ſo on, till they be conveyed to the
place where the Men are, for whoſe uſe
the Fruit is deſigned.</p>
               <p>The ſecond <hi>Auſtralian</hi> Battle, in which
I was, happened 17 years after that, upon
the following occaſion. The <hi>Fondins</hi> had
ſeized upon a very conſiderable Iſland, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
10 Leagues from the <hi>Sezain,</hi> or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrict
of Grief; it was about 18 Leagues in
length, and 14 in breadth, the Ground
there being very good, they had fortified
themſelves there, and were grown very po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous.
The mildneſs of the Air joyned
with the plenty and fruitfulneſs of the
place, drawing thither daily a confluence
of new Colonies, from whence they made
hold afterwards to make incurſions into
the Continent of the <hi>Auſtralians;</hi> upon
which, thoſe People having taken a Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
to drive them out of that Iſland, they
wrote only to the 500 next <hi>Sezains,</hi> who
detached for that purpoſe each of them
400 Men, ſo that in a trice they raiſed an
Army of 200000 Men; they immediate-prepared
a kind of great flat Ferry-boat,
and built like a Platform, which contained
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:54359:76"/>
300 Men in Front, and 400 on each ſide,
ſo that it was capable of wafting over
12000 Men, ready ranged, in order of
Battel, which they made to be advanced
in that manner towards the Iſland. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
which, they equipped 600 other
ſmall Veſſels, that carried each 100 Men,
and 400 others, laden with Ammunition
and Proviſions. Amongſt all the Engines
of War, I ſaw there, I took notice of one,
which conſiſted of ſeveral Ladders, which
ſtuck certain pointed Irons into the Walls
of any Town they were applied againſt,
which by the help of a Spring, enlarged
themſelves like a hook, as ſoon as they
had made their paſſage into the Wall, and
then afterwards being turned about with
a Wheel, theſe Engines would ſhake down,
and overthrow the ſtrongeſt Walls. I was
upon the Ferry-boat, or Platform, when
they began to advance againſt the <hi>Fondins,</hi>
which had been preparing themſelves for
three Months before, for a vigorous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence:
They were provided with all
ſorts of Proviſions, and their Army was
compoſed of 300000 fighting Men, all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to overcome, or die. In the mean
time, the <hi>Auſtraliaas</hi> being come within
view of the Iſland of the <hi>Fondins,</hi> made a
ſtop to conſult which way they might be<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

aſſault their Enemies: And it was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in Council, that they ſhould Land
20000 Men in the Night out of their
ſmaller Veſſels, to ſurround the Iſland,
and to engage the <hi>Fondins</hi> to fight, whilſt
10000 more ſhould throw themſelves into
the Water, and ſwim over into the Iſland
with the Inſtruments, neceſſary to beat
down their Walls: which Reſolution was
executed with ſo much Order and Celeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that the <hi>Fondins</hi> had no time to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think
themſelves how to prevent the blow.
The 10000 attackt the firſt Wall; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
beaten it down, 2000 of them ſwam
over, and attacked the ſecond Wall; in
which, when they had made ſome Breach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
the Sentinels hearing the noiſe, went,
and immediately alarmed the next Court
of Guard: But the Ardour of the <hi>Auſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
was ſo great, that before their Enemies
could have notice of their Approach, they
had already paſſed to the number of 500
beyond the Wall, who kept firm in a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to cover the aſcent of the others, who
mounted with ſuch a ſurprizing Expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that in an hours time, 20000 of them
paſſed over the Wall in ſpite of all the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of the <hi>Fondins.</hi> In the mean
while, their King being informed that the
<hi>Auſtralians</hi> were in earneſt entring his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:54359:77"/>
took with him 6000 choſen Men out
of a Body of Reſerve, and advanced at
the head of them, to view the Enemy.
The <hi>Auſtralians</hi> on their ſide gave mighty
Shouts to give notice to the reſt of their
party behind, that they had paſſed the
Wall, ſo that when the <hi>Fondins</hi> had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
an obſtinate fight, the <hi>Auſtralians</hi> that
were not yet paſſed the Wall, climbed
upon all ſides, and in ſpite of all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
the <hi>Fondins</hi> could make, ſcaled,
and paſſed it, to the number of 50000,
who made themſelves Maſters of a part of
the Wall, as the day began to appear, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which the Veſſels advanced to the
Shoar, and Landed 20000 more, who like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
paſſed after their Companions over
the Walls; ſo that the <hi>Fondins,</hi> who by
that time had got together above 100000
Men, ſeeing the evident danger that
threatned them, drew themſelves all cloſe
up into one united Body, with a Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to venture all for all, and fell ſo
fiercely upon a Body of the Enemies
that made head againſt them, that
they would have entirely defeated
them, if another Body of <hi>Auſtralians</hi> that
had beaten down above 200 Fathoms,
or 400 Yards of Wall, had not come up
timely to their Aſſiſtance, which was a
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:54359:78"/>
Detachment of 6000 Soldiers from the
Platform; who being all freſh, and in a
good condition, charged the <hi>Fondins</hi> in
the Rear, and made ſuch a dreadful ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of them, that there hardly eſcaped
2000, who fled, and ſaved themſelves in
a ſmall adjoyning Fortreſs, and ſo the
<hi>Auſtralians</hi> became Maſters of the Field:
But however, before they would attack
the Fortreſſes that ſtood further within
the Iſland, they firſt made ſure of all the
Paſſages and Outworks of it, that they
cut off all poſſibility from the <hi>Fondins,</hi> of
eſcaping their Hands: They ſpent two
days in that work, and two more in look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the Bodies of the Brethren that
were ſlain in the Fight, of which they
reckoned 42000, to whom they paid the
uſual Honour of Burial; after which, they
likewiſe took the number of the <hi>Fondins</hi>
that were killed, which amounted to 12000.</p>
               <p>When they had ſo done, they marched
about to all the Towns in the Iſland, and
took Five of them by Aſſault in one day,
moſt unmercifully killing all they met.
And here I cannot but with Regret, take
notice to you, that I do not believe any
Country in the World can produce more
lovely and beautiful Women than there
were to be ſeen in this, which made me
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:54359:78"/>
in ſpight of all the Violence I uſed to my
natural Inclination, in order to conform
my ſelf to the cruel and pittileſs Cuſtoms
and Proceedings of the <hi>Auſtralians,</hi> not
able to forbear ſhewing ſome Marks of
Compaſſion, when I ſaw the Throats of
ſo many fair and charming Creatures, ſo
miſerably, and unmercileſly cut, which
much ſcandalized thoſe Brethren that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
my tenderneſs: but the matter was
much aggravated, when breaking into a
Houſe that ſeemed more conſiderable
than the reſt, I found in it a venerable
Matron, with two Daughters, of between
25 or 26 Years of Age, of a moſt Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd
Beauty, that threw themſelves down
at my Feet; for their Charms ſo ſtrongly
Tranſported me, that being almoſt bereft
of my Reaſon, and my Judgment, I incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderately
advanced towards one of thoſe
young Ladies, whom I graſped Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately
in my Arms, to lift her up, when
two <hi>Auſtralians</hi> came in, juſt at that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and ſurprized me in the Action.</p>
               <p>I ſaw by the Fire, that flaſht in their
Eyes, and by the Indignation which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in their Faces, that I was a loſt
Man; nevertheleſs they contented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
only with cutting the Throats of
thoſe Ladies in my Preſence, I knew not
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:54359:79"/>
afterwards, neither what to reſolve up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
nor what would become of me, nor
durſt I look an <hi>Auſtralian</hi> in the Face;
and as ſoon as any one came near me, I
held down my Eyes, and Confuſion ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it ſelf in my Face. In this Perplexity,
I returned on Board to the Veſſel, where
I feined my ſelf wounded, that they might
not take it ill, that I had quitted the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and I remained, with a Spirit ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
and ſad, that I could ſcarce ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
my ſelf. In the mean time, the plain
Country, and all the Towns being ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
they reſolved to Attack the ſtrong
places, of which they inveſted three at
once, and all the works of a Siege among
theſe People, being to dig the Earth round
about the place which they Attack, 300
Men were employed in that Work for
three days; at the end of which they
came to the Walls, notwithſtanding the
Sallies of the <hi>Fondins;</hi> then they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
them, and diſmantled thoſe Cities
in a trice, to the great Aſtoniſhment of
all the Inhabitants; they gave at the ſame
time a general Aſſault, and all the valour
of the <hi>Fondins,</hi> who defended themſelves
very Couragiouſly, did not hinder them
from taking the ſtrong places in four
days time: The ſlaughter was there
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:54359:79"/>
general, and they ſpared neither Women,
old People, nor Children, all were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veloped
in one common Maſſacre; thoſe
that were in the other Fortreſſes, did
not ſtay to be Beſieged, they went out
the Night before they were to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted,
and the next day, were
to be ſeen on the Banks of the Sea, more
than 200000 People, of all Ages and
Sexes, ſome of which threw themſelves
head-long into the Water, others caſt
themſelves upon the Mercy of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
others with Hands lifted up to
Heaven, expected Death, which they
ſaw inevitable.</p>
               <p>Thus this fine Iſland was diſpeopled,
the <hi>Auſtralians,</hi> collected into many heaps
the Bodies of the <hi>Fondins,</hi> and left them
upon the Banks of the Sea, without bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
expoſing them to the Birds, who
devoured them. Beſides theſe <hi>Auſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,</hi>
who were killed at the firſt Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault
of the Iſle (of which we have
ſpoken) there was found 18000 more,
which were tranſported out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
upon many Veſſels: they carried
back the Wounded in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
which were to the number of
30000 Men.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:54359:80"/>
As the <hi>Auſtralians</hi> are very dilligent at
the <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> of <hi>Hab,</hi> and of <hi>Heb,</hi> as well
at home, as abroad, ſo ſoon as the Iſle
was taken, they met together, to praiſe
God, and to conſider of ſeveral other Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
of which the principal were how to
diſpoſe of me, and how to deſtroy the
Iſland. I was accuſed upon Five Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
every one of which deſerved death;
and having had my hearing, I was ſent
back into my <hi>Sezain.</hi> After that, they
came to a reſolution to demoliſh the
Iſland, with two Armies of fifty Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Men each: and this prodigious
maſſe of Earth was deſtroyed, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with Water, in ten of their Months.
A Work which the <hi>Europeans</hi> could never
have finiſhed in ten Years, and which is
more, would never have dared to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken.
This is what I have ſeen of the
War between the <hi>Auſtralians</hi> and the
<hi>Fondins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides theſe Enemies, the <hi>Auſtralians</hi>
have thoſe to fight withal, which they
call <hi>Sea-Monſters;</hi> this is the Name they
give the <hi>Europeans,</hi> becauſe they are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of their Country, and they never
ſee them come but by Sea in Ships. They
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:54359:80"/>
never call them any thing elſe but <hi>Sea-Monsters,</hi>
or <hi>Half-men.</hi> The old Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher,
who was ſo much my Friend,
and who took ſuch delight, a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he died, to hear me talk of my
Country, told me, That he had ſeen
ſome People approach their Coaſts, who
were made juſt after the proportion that
I ſpoke of; that he admired the Fabrick
of their Ships, and that he was always
deſirous to know more of the Country of
theſe <hi>Half-men,</hi> and that he found a
great deal of pleaſure in what I had told
him, and what he believed before.</p>
               <p>He told me, among other Diſputes
which they had had with theſe <hi>Half-men,</hi>
they had at one time met with ſo reſolute
Men, that they were three whole Days
before they could take Seven of their
Ships: I ſaw theſe Veſſels upon the
Shoar; for the <hi>Australians</hi> keep all their
Prizes, as Trophies of their Glory and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</p>
               <p>When I came thither, about ſix Months
before, they had defeated a whole Fleet
of them; and I ſaw a great many Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
hung upon the Maſts, whom by
their Cloaths, I know to be <hi>French, Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi>
and <hi>Portugueſe.</hi> My old Man,
who ſaw the Battle, told me, he never
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:54359:81"/>
ſaw the like of it, except what I did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the wild Birds. The Pilot having
obſerved ſome little Rivolets of Water
deep enough, came up within half a Mile
of the Shoar, but not finding there but
two Foot of Water, he was forced to
ſtop; he immediately cauſed a Thouſand
Men to Land, to view the Country. They
came with a great deal of bravery, and
eaſily forced the Sea-Guards, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
gave the Signal, the Enemy were
come. But the Enemy having boarded
a <hi>Sezain</hi> which they met, and falling a
plundering, the Sea-Guards did ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>double
their Signals, that before the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropeans</hi>
could have done plundering, there
appeared eight Thouſand <hi>Auſtralians</hi>
upon the Shoar. The <hi>Europeans</hi> fired a
great many pieces of Cannon, but few
did Execution. In the mean time the
<hi>Auſtralians</hi> ſurrounded thoſe-few that had
landed, in a little Houſe, which they
had before forced open, and in which
they defended themſelves for ſome time,
but at laſt they were forced to ſubmit to
Number, and not one Man eſcaped to
carry the News to the <hi>Fleet.</hi> After that
the <hi>Auſtralians</hi> made a conſiderable turn
to ſecure the paſſage of the River, in
which they are admirable, by filling dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouſly
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:54359:81"/>
the Mouth of the River with ſuch
heaps of Earth, as it was impoſſible for
the Enemy of paſs. After this, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to board them, but the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropeans</hi>
made ſo good uſe of their Cannon
and ſmall Arms, that of eight Thouſand
<hi>Auſtralians,</hi> there was ſix Thouſand kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
before one Man could board them.
And my old Man aſſured me, that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
had ſeen ſo much bravery in any of
their Enemies. Notwithſtanding all this,
the <hi>Auſtralians</hi> being conſtantly ſupplied
with freſh Men, they began a new At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack
with twelve Thouſand Men, who
were very bravely received, but not with
ſuch a loſs as the former; they boarded
the Ships with a wonderful courage; yet
the <hi>Europeans</hi> firing from all parts upon
them, they had killed above four Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand,
when on a ſuddain the <hi>Auſtralians</hi>
were reinforced with two Thouſand
freſh Men, who finding the Enemy al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
quite fatigued, immediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated
them. There was in all, three
Thouſand Seamen, and as many Soldiers,
who had all their Throats cut, in leſs than
an Hour.</p>
               <p>But the ordinary Fights which the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtralians</hi>
have againſt the Birds, of which
we have ſpoken, are much more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome;
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:54359:82"/>
becauſe coming, and going by
the Air, there is no means neither to
ſtop, nor deſtroy them. They fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
theſe terrible <hi>Beaſts</hi> three ſeveral
ways; becauſe they are attacked by them
in as many; for ſometimes they hide
themſelves in the <hi>Trees,</hi> ſometimes they
fly out of ſight, to throw themſelves upon
their Prey in a Minute. The little <hi>Birds,</hi>
of which I have ſpoke before, will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them a great way off, and ſtrike
their <hi>Bills</hi> with ſeveral doleful cries, to
give notice to the <hi>Auſtralians,</hi> to put
themſelves upon their Guard. Yet theſe
<hi>Beaſts,</hi> notwithſtanding all their precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
ſeldom miſs their blow. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
once, as I was going to <hi>Heb,</hi> in the
company of my Philoſopher, armed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to our cuſtom, with Halberts,
Caſques, and Cuiraſſes, after our mode,
we had ſcarce gone half our way, when
the little Birds began to cry, and fly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
us, in a frightful manner, to give
us notice of our danger. In ſhort, we
immediately perceived ſome of theſe
great <hi>Birds,</hi> who came to attack us. We
then crowded one upon the other, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
our ſelves with our Arms, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
our ſelves ready for defence. One
of theſe dreadful <hi>Beasts</hi> ſnatched my Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:54359:82"/>
out of my hand, with a force no
man alive was able to reſiſt. The other
five fell ſo furiouſly upon my Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that they had an incredible difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to ſave themſelves; and juſt as I tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
my Head, to ſee how I might come
to their help, I my ſelf was carried off;
and I had been infallibly loſt, if five of
my other brethren had not come to my
aſſiſtance, and cleared me from the claws
of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> that held me. But then many
more of our brethren coming in, the
Birds flew away.</p>
               <p>But that which is moſt terrible is, that
theſe horrible <hi>Beaſts</hi> aſſemble themſelves
ſometimes to the number of four, or five
hundred, forming a body of an Army;
where it ſeems they obſerve a ſort of a
Diſcipline, in their Combats with the
<hi>Auſtralians.</hi> They Camp in all places in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently
where they find Food. The
<hi>Auſtralians</hi> canton themſelves into their
Houſes, none dare ſtir out; they put up
the Signal to give notice, that the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
is there, and every one to take care
of themſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:54359:83"/>
The Regularity, which they obſerve
to fight with theſe Birds, is greater than
that which they obſerve to fight the
<hi>Fondins;</hi> they ſtand cloſe togehter, and
ſo order it, that they have a Front on
every ſide. They have their <hi>Sarbecans,</hi>
of which I ſpoke before; in ſhort, they
are made of Halberts and Cutlaces:
So ſoon as the Birds perceive them co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
againſt them, they ſeperate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
ſome flying on one ſide, and ſome
on the other, the greateſt part of them
out of ſight; but this is only to joyn
themſelves the cloſer, to fall together
upon the <hi>Auſtralians;</hi> who, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
all their Precautions, always
loſe ſome Men in their firſt Attacks.
I was preſent at three Fights with them,
we loſt at the firſt 6 Men, at the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
eight, at the third three; and in
the three Fights altogether we killed but
ſeven of the Birds. It is impoſſible to
tell you with what force they fall upon
Men, and what furious ſtrokes they will
give with their Bills; I ſaw an Action in
the laſt Combat, that's worth relating,
An <hi>Urg</hi> took away the Halbert of one
of my Companions, and another ſeized
his Perſon; I would have defended him
with my Halbert, but a third <hi>Urg</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:54359:83"/>
him off: my Neighbour ſtuck to
him, and the ſame <hi>Bird</hi> carried away
both: Another took hold of one of
them, but another <hi>Urg</hi> threw himſelf
furiouſly at him; and as he was carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him of, I joyned my ſelf to him to
ſtop him, but we had all four been carried
off, if we had not knocked down one
of the <hi>Birds,</hi> for the others immediately
quitted us after that, and we found one
of the <hi>Auſtralians,</hi> which they let fall
dead and ſtrangled, by being pinched
too hard by them; they obſerve that
when the Sea hath been Tempeſtuous
for four or five days, theſe <hi>Birds</hi> are in
a ſort of a rage, becauſe they cannot
take the Fiſh, which they do at other
times for their uſual Nouriſhment. I
have told you before, that the <hi>Auſtrali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
have, and do yet continue to make
extraordinary Efforts to deſtroy theſe
terrible Enemies. They demoliſhed 30
Years ago three conſiderable Iſlands,
where theſe <hi>Birds</hi> harbour, of two Leagues
in length, and at preſent they are about
deſtroying another that is ſix Leagues
from their Country. The moſt proper
ſeaſon for this is the Tropick of <hi>Capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn,</hi>
and they continue to the Aequinox
of <hi>March,</hi> at which time <hi>Birds</hi> beginning
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:54359:84"/>
to grow warm, begin their threatning,
but without effect, till the Sun enters
into the Sign of <hi>Taurus.</hi> 'Tis then that
they come to Attack the <hi>Auſtralians</hi> in
Troops, with ſo much fury, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they are able to do, cannot hinder
them from loſing ſeveral Men; the heat
of theſe Engagements will ſometimes
continue for ſix Hours together, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
intermiſſion for thirty Days, and
after that, they go away by ſmall Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels,
till the Month of <hi>October,</hi> where they
return again with the ſame fury.</p>

and Intereſts of the <hi>Auſtralians,</hi>

the Preſervation of my Life to nothing

and to the continual violence I did

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> there often fell from me ſome
Words or Actions, which ſhewed what I
really was. The good old Philoſopher
made an hundred Harangues in my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:54359:85"/>
while he was alive, and to ſtop
the Deſigns that their Brothers had form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
againſt me; he ſet out my fighting as
an unheard of Prodigy, and which alone
rendered me worthy of their Protection,
notwithſtanding all my faults. He main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
that ſince they had taken me
into their Protection, though I was a
Stranger, they could not now take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
my Life without manifeſt Injuſtice,
ſince what I did amiſs proceeded from
my Nature; he added after all, that
ſince I was a Stranger, they ought not
to condemn me till they could hear
what I could ſay in my own defence.
When he died, he redoubled his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties,
and Reaſons, to oblidge them
to preſerve me, and named me to be
his Lieutenant, after an Exhortation,
truly paternal, which he made to me,
and all the Brothers accepted it, with
their common Conſent. In fine, he
ſupported me till the War of the <hi>Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dins,</hi>
of which I have ſpoke, where my
ruin was fixed, and reſolved on.</p>
               <p>The Accuſation that was formed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
me, may be reduced to five
principal heads: The firſt was, that I
had not fought with the others, ſince I
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:54359:85"/>
could not produce an Ear of the <hi>Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dins:</hi>
Secondly, That I had teſtified a
great Grief, in ſeeing the Deſtruction of
their Enemies: Thirdly, That I had
embraced a <hi>Fundine:</hi> Fourthly, That I
had eaten the Meat of the <hi>Fundines:</hi>
and laſtly, That I had made Queſtions
full of Malice to the Brothers. To
underſtand theſe Accuſations, you muſt
know, that it is a Cuſtom of the <hi>Auſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi>
to cut off the Ears of thoſe that they
kill in fight, and make a Girdle of them;
he that brings moſt is eſteemed moſt
Couragious; and there was ſome that
in the taking of the Iſland, that brought
off 200.</p>
               <p>As for my part, I was ſo far from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
killed any of them, that I teſtified an
extream regret, to ſee the bloody <hi>Butchery</hi>
of thoſe unhappy People; I have told you
already of the tenderneſs which I ſhewed
to a pretty <hi>Fondin</hi> Lady, whom I found in
an Houſe with her Mother. The <hi>Auſtrali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
looked upon this as the greateſt crime
I could commit, and there was none of
them afterwards but abhorred me.</p>
               <p>They charged me beſides, that I had
the boldneſs ro propoſe the Preſervation
of ſome of the <hi>Fundines</hi> Women, to be
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:54359:86"/>
made uſe of as Slaves, and that I had
openly declared, that I preferred the Life
of one <hi>Fondin</hi> Woman, before all the
Booty I could pretend to in the Iſland.</p>
               <p>So ſoon as they had heard theſe Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations
againſt me, they propoſed to
Death to me, but with ſo imperious an
Air, that I had nothing elſe to do but to
accept of it: And for as much as they
kept a great ſilence, when I came to the
Table to eat, according to the Cuſtom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
I began to ſpeak, and told the Brothers
aſſembled, that I had ſuch eſſential Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
to them, that I could not leave
them without communicating to them a
grand Secret, which I had for the eaſie
Deſtruction of the <hi>Urges</hi> I added, that I
was really guilty of the Crimes of which
I was accuſed; but ſince all thoſe crimes
came from my nature, which all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
knew to be like that of the <hi>Fundins;</hi>
I appeal to their Conſciences, if being
reſolved to ſuffer me to live among
them, knowing me for a <hi>Fundine;</hi> they
ought not alſo to pardon thoſe faults,
which were inſeparable from thoſe of my
Species: Its true, ſaid I, that I have te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified
a great deal of kindneſs to thoſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that were like me; it is true, that I could
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:54359:86"/>
cut their Throats; 'tis true, that I ſhew'd
a compaſſion for thoſe who are even as
my ſelf: And if I had not done this, I
muſt have renounced my nature, and
their own Reaſon, which Judges ſo well
of things, would have juſtly condemned
me of cruelty.</p>
               <p>If an <hi>Auſtralian</hi> ſhould happen to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the <hi>Fundines,</hi> would not he be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable,
if in a War againſt his own
Nation, he ſhew'd not ſome kindneſs to
them. But after all, do not believe that
I am ſo deſirous to preſerve my life, I am
glad to retire, I only demand a delay of
a few days, to have time to ſhew you,
that this poor Stranger, whom you have
protected, is not ungrateful for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
received of you.</p>
               <p>They went out of the <hi>Hab,</hi> according
to the accuſtomed manner, without gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
any Anſwer, ſo that I ſaw I had no
other way left, but induſtriouſly to ſtudy
out ſome way of returning into my own
Country. In this cogitation, all the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures
of my former Voyage, which
brought me to the place where I now
was, ran in my mind. I had always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
my Eyes the opportunity which was
ſo favourable to me; and I imagined, that
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:54359:87"/>
if I could, after any faſhion, ſhift away
from the ſight of theſe <hi>Auſtralians,</hi> my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
would be ſecured; and after I had
revovled in my mind, a great many ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
methods and deſigns, this was the
Reſolution which I took and executed. I
made a Cord of the bark of a Tree,
which is named <hi>S chuch;</hi> I rubbed it with
the juice of the Fruit <hi>Repoſe,</hi> mingled with
a little Sea-Water, which render'd it as
hard as Iron; I afterward rubbed it with
another Juice, which made it flexible,
and at laſt made a kind of Rope, which
I tied faſt to a Tree, where the <hi>Urgs</hi> uſed
to perch; I never ceaſed to go and come,
expecting with impatience the ſucceſs
which I had promiſed my ſelf from this
deſign. At laſt my little Birds having ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſed
me to retire, I ſaw two <hi>Urgs</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
high in the Air, which lighted exactly
upon the Tree where I had ſtretched my
Cord, and one of them was taken by the
end of the Foot.</p>
               <p>The Brothers, who ſaw that he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
ran preſently to knock him down;
but I entreated them to let me alone with
him, aſſuring them, that they ſhould in
a little while ſee ſomething more ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
than what they now beheld.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:54359:87"/>
My Beaſt ſeeing himſelf taken, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
two days in a very ill humour
when I approached him, but at laſt, when
he ſaw no appearance of eſcaping, and
that hunger and famine preſſed him, he
begun to be more gentle, and to ſuffer
me to approach to give him meat; I fed
him all alone, and he began to know
me; I made much of him, and he ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it; I lift up his huge Feet, I looked
upon his Talons, I opened his Beak, and
mounted upon his Back: In fine, I did
whatſoever I would with him: I ſaid
then to my ſelf, ſince I was firſt driven
into this Countrey by the perſecution of
theſe Beaſts, why may I not depart
hence too by their Aſſiſtance? I had
great hope of my Bird, and my hope in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
as his kindneſs increaſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
me.</p>
               <p>In the mean time they ſpoke of my
Conduct at the <hi>HAB</hi> with praiſe, and
ſeeing that they admired it, I made a ſpeech
and told them, that I begun now to look
upon my ſelf as one whoſe being was in
a manner ceas'd; that ſince it was the
Cuſtom of our Nation, that when any
one was at the point of Death, to live
with great Reſervedneſs, and that my
ſpirit would not permit me to be the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:54359:88"/>
ſame that I had been, and that knowing
that I ſhould ceaſe to be in a little time,
I would employ the Moments that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
to ſtudy out ſome laſt action
which ſhould edifie them much more
than my firſt. Theſe Reaſons did very
much ſatisfie the Aſſembly, and they
were reſolved to let me finiſh my Life
as I pleaſed, without ſpeaking any more
either of my words or actions. And ſince
I ought to be reckoned in the number
of the dead, they themſelves named me
Lieutenant, and regarded me no more
but as a dying perſon, who was at Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to finiſh his Life as himſelf thought fit.
This Order gave me ſo much conſolation,
that I then looked upon my deliverance
for moſt aſſured.</p>
               <p>I paſſed almoſt the whole day with my
Bird, and I omitted no way to ſhew him
all the kindneſs I poſſibly could. I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
one day that he had a great pain,
and I found that the Cord which ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
him had cut the skin of his Foot,
and was entred a good way into his fleſh;
the wound was very conſiderable, and I
uſed all means poſſible to cure him; I
poured in the Juice of a Fruit to conſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
the wound, I bound it up handſomly,
and in eight days he became perfectly
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:54359:88"/>
well. His kindneſs upon this augmented
ſo much towards me, that he would not
ſuffer me to go from him: And I on the
other ſide was never content but when
I was with him: I let him by little and
little go looſe alone, and he was ſo far
from flying away, that he made conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
Efforts to follow me every where:
I was deſirous to try whether he could
carry me flying, and I found that he did
it with pleaſure, and a ſurprizing ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
After this I made a Girdle of many
Leaves, which I rubbed with the Juice
of the Fruit of Repoſe, to make it of
proof againſt Water; I made afterward
a kind of Bag, and having filled it with
the moſt nouriſhing Fruits of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
and ſome Bottles of the Liquor
which they drink there, with which I
put alſo the <hi>Manuſcript of this Hiſtory,</hi> I
put them all up very neatly, and girded
them round about me.</p>
               <p>Beſides this, I made a little Wallet
which I filled with Fruit for the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of my Beaſt, and have tied it neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon his back, I reſolved to depart
the night following, which was the
15th of the <hi>Solſtice</hi> of <hi>Capricorn</hi> 35 years
and ſome months after my firſt arrival
into the <hi>Auſtralian</hi> Countrey, and in the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:54359:89"/>
Fifty ſeventh year of mine Age.</p>
               <p>That my Bird then might the more
eaſily take his flight, I made him get up
upon a Tree, and ſeating my ſelf under
his wings, I made him begin his flight
very high in the Air, for fear of being
perceived by thoſe that guarded the Sea,
but the great Cold of the middle Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of the Air quickly obliged me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
a little lower.</p>
               <p>In the mean time we had been above
ſix mile already on our way, whether
my Beaſt became again ſenſible of his
wound, or whether too long a reſt had
rendred him more heavy, I perceived he
was extreamly fatigued, and could hold
out no longer: I then ſo ordered him
to light down upon the Water, and as he
ſunk a little too deep, I leaped off to
eaſe him, well knowing that my Girdle
would ſupport me, and keep me out of
danger. This poor Animal fearing then
that I would be loſt, or would quit him,
began to cry and turn towards me with
an agitation that ſhewed his pain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs;
but being my ſelf more weary
than he, I leaned my head upon his
Feathers, and having given him ſome of
the Fruits in the Wallet, I fell into a
ſound ſleep. I found the day very fine
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:54359:89"/>
and clear at my awaking, and made my
Bird eat again, and took a Repaſt my
ſelf; I mounted again upon him nimbly
enough, with deſign to advance the more
ſwiftly on our way: But whatſoever
Efforts he made, he was never able to
take his flight, becauſe the ſtrange hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs
of my body made him ſink too
low in the Water; we were forced then,
whether we would or no, to remain in
the place where we now were, and any
one may judge what pain and trouble I
was then in: Nevertheleſs, having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
that my Beaſt went very well,
and ſwiftly in the Water, I tied my
ſelf to his Tail, and he drew me far
enough to diſcover a little Iſland which
appeared almoſt out of ſight. As the
night approached, and my Bird being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
weary, I ſtaid to feed him, and eat
my ſelf alſo with him; but I was very
much aſtoniſhed to ſee him ſtop ſhort;
for whether it was that he regretted his
former condition, or whether he could
not live in a different Air from that of
his own Climate, or whether he was
only concerned at the trouble he ſaw me
in, he would not ſtir a bit further. Night
came upon us a little after, and he ſlept
ſoundly, but I could not ſo much as ſhut
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:54359:90"/>
mine Eyes: I deliberated a long time
upon what I ſhould do, and after a great
many thoughts, I judged it moſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
to ſlip the Wallet from off his
back, and to ſeparate my ſelf entirely
from him, though with a great deal of
regret.</p>
               <p>After I had done this, ſeeing my
Girdle and my Bag ſupported me per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
well, I began to go away from my
Beaſt, and to go forward by the favour
of a South-wind which aſſiſted me; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that at Day-break I found my ſelf
arrived without any inconvenience in
the Iſland which I diſcovered the night
before.</p>
               <p>Then I went out of the Water, and
ſat me down upon the Land, and I eat
ſome of my fruit, with ſuch a ſenſible
pleaſure tempered with that conſolation
that I never yet enjoy'd the like. Sleep
ſeized me afterwards, and I ſlept about
ſix hours, and waking I reſolved to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
my Voyage, and to advance, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
bearing towards the North, for
fear of being in danger to be loſt in the
Great Sea which ſeparates the <hi>Old World
from the New.</hi> But I was ſcarce got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Water when I heard the noiſe of
the flying of the Great Birds which I have
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:54359:90"/>
ſpoken of. My very Heart trembled at
this noiſe, and I thought my ſelf loſt at
firſt, but my fear was preſently turned
into joy, when I found that it was my
own Beaſt that was looking for me,
and who came to caſt himſelf at my Feet
with ſo many careſſes and ſo many marks
of ſorrow becauſe I had left him: I was
touched with the moſt tender compaſſion
that ever I had in my life, and becauſe
I knew he had tired himſelf very much
in ſeeking me, I ſtaid in the Iſland a Day
and a Night, to reſt, and gave him ſome
fruits out of my Wallet; he had ſcarce
begun to Eat when ten great Beaſts, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
of the colour of our Wolves came
up towards us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> My Bird who perceived
them before me, ſet upon them with
great impetuoſity and fury, and taking
up one and carrying it up into the Air, he
let it fall upon another and knockt it on
the Head, upon which all the reſt imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
fled, but before they could get to
their Holes, he catched a third, of which
he eat half and brought the reſt to me.
The night following I ſlept with him ſix
or ſeven hours, but my Bird did not ſleep
till after me, and awaked very near as
ſoon as I; He no ſooner had his Eyes
open, but he fell upon one of the Beaſts
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:54359:91"/>
that he had ſlain and made his breakfaſt
of it: I eat alſo ſome of my fruits, and
preſently got upon a little Rock and
mounted his Back as before, we advanced
with a ſurprizing ſwiftneſs, and had made
a great deal of way, when two Birds of
the ſame bigneſs came to encounter us,
and launching themſelves againſt us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to attack us with great blows, of
their Beaks and Talons. It was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for this poor Creature to make his
part good, as well becauſe his burden
put him out of a ſtate of defence as that
the two Birds were each of them as
ſtrong as himſelf; I had received already
ſome blows which made me all bloody,
and alſo ſeeing that we were both of us in
equal danger, and that in hindering him
to ſave his life, I could not ſecure mine
own, I leaped off from his back, and caſt
my ſelf into the Water, where I lay
ſome time to look upon the Combat; My
Bird held himſelf upon the defenſive, and
contented himſelf to preſent his Talons
and his Beak to guard off the blows as
much as he could. But at laſt a miſt
which begun to ſpread it ſelf inſenſibly
quite deprived me of the ſight of this
ſpectacle. I fell then into a deep grief,
and made many reflections upon my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:54359:91"/>
Eſtate, and I was reduced to it by
mine own fault.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Auſtralia</hi> repreſented it ſelf to me
with all its advantages, and the Iſland
which I had newly left, ſeemed to me
extremely Commodious, and I thought
I might have paſt the reſt of my Days
there without fear or danger, becauſe
my Bird would have guarded me againſt
all that durſt attacque me. I then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
that I was the cauſe of mine
own unhappineſs.</p>
               <p>That which compleated my misfortune
was, that I knew not what to do, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able to ſee thirty yards before me.
Theſe ſad thoughts perplexed my mind,
when I heard a great noiſe like a Ship that
ſpread all its Sails, I begun to cry out,
when I was perceived by the Marriners
who ſhot at me, and I was wounded in
many places, but ſlightly.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Veſſel approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
they knew by my voice and my
actions, that I was a man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they took me
on board, and uſed me with great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion,
they looked upon my wounds,
and waſhed them with Oil and Wine
and having poured upon them a precious
Balm they bound them up very neatly.</p>
               <p>Becauſe they appeared to be Europe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:54359:92"/>
I ſpoke Latine to them, I underſtood
that they were French, and that their
Veſſel parted a little while ago from the
Iſle of <hi>Madagaſcar</hi> with deſign to cruiſe
for a booty.</p>
               <p>The Captain who was a man of quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
having underſtood that I was an Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean
came to ſee me, and ſpoke to me
with a great deal of kindneſs, gave me
a ſuit of his apparel, took me into his
Company, and made me eat at his Table.
The firſt entertainment I had with him
laſted for three hours. I recounted to him
the Hiſtory of my Birth, of my Education,
of my Shipwracks, and of my Arrival in
<hi>Auſtralia.</hi> He heard me with a great deal
of attention, &amp; was aſtoniſh'd that I could
ſurvive ſo many evils that I had ſuffered.
I heard that he ſpoke in French to the
Company all that I had ſaid in Latin, and
all of them admired that I ſhould eſcape
ſo many dangers. He had afterwards
the diſcretion to let me eat without ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me any more queſtions; But ſince
I had loſt the uſe of the European meats,
I found no taſte in them, and my ſtomach
would ſcarce endure them. I took then
of my Fruits which begun to wax old, and
my little Bottles which began to dry, I
offered one to the Captain who taſted it,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:54359:92"/>
and proteſted that he had never drank any
thing ſo delicious. He deſired a ſecond
of me, and drank to the Mr. Pilot, he
would have a third, and afterwards a
fourth, and never ceaſed, till my Girdle
was quite empty. There was no body
but admired both the colour and delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of the Fruits, and they could ſcarce
believe they were natural.</p>
               <p>Our Repaſt being over, I was obliged
to begin my Hiſtory again, and recount
as well as I could poſſibly, the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
of the <hi>Auſtralian</hi> Countrey, the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
and Cuſtoms of the Inhabitants,
and the reſt. The Captain was at a
great loſs to believe me, but I reported
ſo many circumſtances of the things
which I advanced, that he could no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
doubt of it. He oftentimes proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that he would willingly run the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of his Life to ſee thoſe things which
I had ſeen. And upon what I ſaid to
him concerning the Situation and
Bounds of the Countrey, he declared
that he ſaw plainly that his Friends
who were gone thither would infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
periſh.</p>
               <p>In the mean time having reſolved to
return to <hi>Madagaſcar,</hi> we ſet Sail, and
after eight days ſailing, we arrived at
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:54359:93"/>
the Port of <hi>Tombolo,</hi> which is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
Southerly to the Iſle of <hi>Madagaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car,</hi>
that is to ſay, South-weſt. The
Captain had a great kindneſs for me,
and would have let me leave him, to
gratifie the Governour of <hi>Tombolo,</hi> who
had a mind to ſee me.</p>

according to <hi>Ptolomy.</hi> This Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
is not only barren, but unhealthful,
ſo far as I am able to judge. They have
no proviſion but what is brought from
other places, and the natural Inhabitants
of the Countrey are not yet ſubjected,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:54359:93"/>
nor have any fixed abode. Here again
I recounted my Hiſtory at length to the
Governour, and had many Conferences
with him, yet being tired with ſtaying
ſo long for a Ship to return into <hi>Europe,</hi>
I prayed the Governour to give me ſome
Men to conduct me up the River which
they call <hi>Sildem,</hi> to enter higher into
the Countrey to make ſome diſcoveries.
The Governour aſſured me that he had
had the ſame curioſity formerly himſelf,
but that he was diverted from it by the
certain information he had that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of the Countrey were ſuch
Salvages, that they ſpared no perſon;
and he added, that about three months
before they entrapped two Souldiers,
and that he had heard by a Salvage, that
they had tied them by the Feet, and
hanged them in Trees at five or ſix
paces diſtance, then knocked them one
againſt the other, that by hurting and
beating one againſt another, they might
be bruiſed to death; and that round
about them there was a great number of
Children who expected when the blood
and brains of thoſe miſerable people
ſhould fall to the ground, on purpoſe to
gather them up, and eat them. And that
theſe barbarous people having ſeen them
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:54359:94"/>
render up their laſt gaſp in theſe cruel
Torments, had taken down their bruiſed
Bodies beaten all black, and devoured
them without any other dreſſing.</p>
               <p>Theſe cruelties hindred me from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring
to know more particularly either
the Countrey or the Inhabitants. I
began then to be extreamly troubled,
when there arrived at the Port a French
Veſſel, which brought a kind of a
Chaloop along with him, which they
had ſeized upon in a Ferry-place as it
was paſſing into an Iſland of the Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
Countrey. There was no body
on Board but a <hi>Venerable old man</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compained
with the ſix Rowers which
ſerved him in the room of Valetts.
This man looked very much like an
<hi>Auſtralian;</hi> his Forehead and Chin
were ſquarer than they were long, his
Hair and all his Beard black, and
his Body of a brown Colour. As ſoon
as I ſaw him I was touched with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
for him, and had an extream de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to know who he was. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
made no difficulty to give me
leave to ſee him, being deſirous that I
ſhould draw out by his means ſome
knowledge of the Countrey, which yet
he hardly believed could be done. I
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:54359:94"/>
came then to the old man, and having
teſtified to him by many ſigns that I was
in the ſame Captivity with himſelf, he
began to ſhew ſome ſigns of comfort.
After three or four Enterviews, I found
a way to make my mind known to him
after this manner. We agreed by ſigns
to frame certain words to explain our
thoughts. I formed two hundred in
one night which he comprehended eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
Having formed in two months time
a kind of Language ſufficiently capable
to make us underſtand one another.
I told him all my Hiſtory, my Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracks,
my Arrival in <hi>Auſtralia,</hi> the
ſtay I had made there, and the manner
of my eſcape. Having engaged him
by all this freedom and openneſs to
put confidence in me; he made no
difficulty to diſcover ſeveral conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
circumſtances of his Countrey to
me. He told me that he lived in the
middle of an Iſland, that the Climate
was very Healthful, the Land very
Fertile, and the People well Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed.
That they had two ſtrong Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricadoes
that ſeparated them on the Eaſt
and Weſt from two barbarous People;
to wit, two prodigious Mountains;
that of the Eaſt was called <hi>Harnor,</hi>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:54359:95"/>
that of the Weſt <hi>Canor:</hi> And that
on the Sea-ſide, Nature had walled
them in with ſuch banks of Sand, that
they could not get over them without
the experience of many years, he added
that their Countrey was about ſix thouſand
Miles about, that the Government was
Ariſtocratical, and that they choſe eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
three years ſix Governours; the firſt
for the North-Sea, the ſecond for the
South-Sea, the third for Mount <hi>Harnor,</hi>
the fourth for Mount <hi>Canor,</hi> and two
others for the reſt of the Countrey;
that theſe Governours had power of
Life and Death over all People within
their diſtrict of what condition ſoever
they were. For the reſt, that they
cultivated the Earth, and ſowed and
reaped as they did in <hi>Europe;</hi> that the
beaſts which ſerved them for Labour
were of the bigneſs of Elephants. That
in General the People of this Countrey
loved their Liberties more than their
Lives, that he was one of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
of which he had told me, whoſe
unhappy loſs was cauſed by a Tempeſt
that roſe againſt all appearance as he
was going to viſit ſome banks of Sand
which encreaſed extraordinarily, that
the Tempeſt having carried him a great
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:54359:95"/>
way off he fell into the hands of Pirates,
who delivered him to the Governour
of <hi>Tombolo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We paſſed whole days in this agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
converſation, when there arrived
two Ships from the <hi>Mogul</hi> that were to
depart in a few days for <hi>Leghorn.</hi> I was
a little troubled to be deprived of the
converſation of a man ſo agreeable and
reaſonable, nevertheleſs not being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to loſe ſo fair an occaſion, I told
him that I was reſolved to take this
opportunity to return into my own
Countrey.</p>
               <p>This news did ſenſibly afflict him, yet
he declared that my deſign was too rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
to be oppoſed, and ſome days
after going to take my leave of him,
he anſwered me coldly, that he ſhould
leave me firſt, and prayed me that I
would preſerve that Friendſhip for him
in my heart, of which I had given
him ſo many teſtimonies of ſince our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance.</p>
               <p>A little while after, he caſt himſelf at
my feet, to ſignifie the eſteem which he
had for me, and having cryed out five or
ſix times in his Language, two of his
Valletts ran to him and ſtrangled him;
and afterwards ran with their heads ſo
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:54359:96"/>
forcibly one againſt the other, that they
beat out their brains and both fell dead
upon the place.</p>
               <p>The four others, though they were
at a diſtance, did the ſame in a moment,
ſo that they were all found dead toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which extreamly ſurprized the
Governour and all that were with him.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the contents of <hi>Sadeurs
Memoirs</hi> written with his own hand.
<hi>His Hiſtory ends here,</hi> and in all appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
being Embarqued preſently after
the Death of the old man of which we
have ſpoken, he had no leiſure to write
the <hi>Adventures</hi> of his return in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi>
