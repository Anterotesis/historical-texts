            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T IS commonly seene (Christian Reader) that cunning men are daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and that the boldest are the blindest ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times: and it is to bee lamented that this curiositie should so bee founde in Christianitie, and that any professours of the Gospell should be deintie to do good. Alas it is but little we can do, when we haue done all, and our life it self is not very long:<note place="margin">Iob. 14.</note> whyle we haue time therefore let vs be do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 5. vers. 8.</note> for Satan neuer sleepeth nor ceaseth destroying. VVe are all in debt to Christes Church, and are bounde to buylde accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our Talent. Let euery man set too his helping hande then, and let Christes cause neuer be hindered for mans credite. Let vs rather consider the Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and expresse our loue by feeding. Tongues that are silent in speaking, should argue hands diligent in writing, especially in a Minister: but when both are ydle, sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:20589:3"/>
all is euill, and that Minister but an Idol before the Lorde. The wise debter vnable to pay all, vseth policie in trifling presents, and findes good ease thereby. Owe we all vnto the Lorde? and shall we bring nothing to his Church? I must needes confesse that I haue bin tardy, and lingred in this fault too long my selfe, but fearing the rashnesse of them that come to soone, I see the daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous lapse, or lashe of them that come too late, and happie is that seruant, whom when his Maister commeth he shall finde dooing. Surely I had denied many petitions, beeing priuie to many infirmities of mine owne, but looke what the forwardnesse of my friende coulde not doe, and that hath the frowardnesse of certayne brought to passe, and I trust all for the best: only I mark this for my learning, that what I denied to doe voluntarily, I am made nowe by an exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in a maner to doe violently: for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can hinder Gods purpose. VVherfore I craue pardon of them, whose instant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests I did incessantly denie, but chiefly of God, whose church is wronged if any thing

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing persuaded that the playner is the better, for the most part, I haue vsed no curiousnesse in the matter, for it can not be so simple, but if it be sounde withall, it shall profite the faythfull reader. The worst fault I finde, is of the most part, who can be content to let all Sermons slip, and scarcely buy one: or if some buy them, to let them sleepe in their houses, who were as good let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alone, for so they lose both their money, and that precious pearle which no money can buy agayne. The benefite of writing deserueth more dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in reading, especially of good things: but the thousands of Pamphlets &amp; toyes are caught vp quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, &amp; deuoured in hast, though they shal ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be disgested into any good substaunce, I feare, they are so full fraught with poyson. It were happie that they were all buried in darknes, or burned in the light, which mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster matter to Fansies schole, or Pleasures pallace, but nothing vnto the church of god. Redeeme the time, for the dayes are euill.<note place="margin">Eph. 5. ver. 16.</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:20589:4"/>
Let this be a warning to you that feare God, to let goe suche Bookes, and to haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with them, the worlde is full of them. Emptie you your houses in the name of God, and let not your youth once finger them, for they are the bane of youth. and learne to play the Bee, not onely to flye and see the floure, but to sucke also: the worde of God is sweeter than hony, or the hony combe. <hi>Psal.</hi> 19. <hi>vers.</hi> 10.</p>
            <p>Beeing diuersly called at this time, I am fayne to prefixe no other preface than the very same whiche I vsed at the Crosse, and that worde for worde, as both my Sermons are, excepting in my latter I haue kept back certayne things, which I thought not so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient or necessarie to divulgate, bicause they concerned the persons then and there more particularly. God encrease thy know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and with knowledge fayth, and with fayth zeale, that thou mayst growe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and righteous to salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in Iesu Christ.

So that we haue the warrant of his woorde, speake and spare not: and as <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. sayth, doo it with all auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, for this matter co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerneth our soules &amp; yours, our lyfe and death and yours, nay both our saluations or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempnations, reade <hi>Eze.</hi> 3. and .33.

               <p>His office declared, here followeth

the order howe he wyll rule (by wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:<note place="margin">He shall prosper with wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</note>) for albeit his Princely power be such, as nothing can resist it, to whom all power is giuen: Yet he doth nothing without his most excellent &amp; irreproueable wisedome, and needeth no counsayler, of whose fulnesse all the wise men in the world, that were wise in déede, haue receyued. To leaue the testimony of scripture, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was fylled with wisdome, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. and to come to his confounding of the Doctors with all their subtyle and serpentine questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who made them blanke with his wonderfull aunsweres, escaping all the snares they layde for him to make him a traytor against <hi>Caesar,</hi> against whome Sathan him selfe coulde not preuaile, for all his vengeable tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: But what shall I take vpon me here to describe his wisedome vnto you, which hath no measure but is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit in it selfe? surely I shal descrie my selfe to be very vnwise then. Why? is he not the wisdome of God his father?
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:20589:27"/>
is not the depth therof bottomlesse? and the height toplesse, and his wayes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable and past finding out? <hi>Ro.</hi> 11. When therefore our Sauiour Christ is thus described as a king, in all those necessary numbers and vertues which pertayne to a Prince, we must note, he geues vs but a glimpse for greater sight, a small tast for a greater portion of knowledge of him: For Salomon in all his royaltie and wisedome, is not comparable vnto him: For shall y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe Ryuers compare with the déepe Seas? or an obscure starre with the brightnes of the Sunne? no, the Moone hir selfe must be vnder, if we wyll be crowned with starres, &amp; receyue light at his brightnesse. This is rather writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for Doctrine to earthly Princes &amp; Magistrates, to knowe that honesty is a good defence for priuate persons: but Rulers must be wyse withall. He that strykes at other mens follyes &amp; offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces by the edge of the lawe, must looke to defende him selfe, and with wisdome
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:20589:27"/>
playe his parte. All the weapons, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, Munitions, blockhouses, castles, &amp; captains, are no such garde to a chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian king, as a breast beset with wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and counsayle.

               <p>Two thinges obserued, wisedome can not but be retayned. The first is, not to tempt God, in refusing lawfull meanes, as Anabaptistes that wyll weare no weapons. Secondly, not to trust to much to our armes. It was wyselie sayde,<note place="margin">
