            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A <hi>NARRATIVE</hi> Containing the Occasion of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing LETTER.</head>
            <p>I Promise not to give any account at this time of the Controversy occasion'd by Mr. <hi>TOLAND</hi>'s Book, nor to enter into the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the Cause on either side. His Adversaries seem not yet weary of writing against him; and when they have once done, it will be early enough then for him to reply, if he sees reason so to do: For it would be an endless labour to make <hi>Answers</hi> severally to so many as may concern themselves in this Dispute. My design is only to shew what Treatment he receiv'd from some People in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as far as that may serve to set the <hi>Letter</hi> annex'd to this Narrative in its proper light. And I shall take care to insert nothing, but such notorious matters of Fact that no observing Person in <hi>Dublin,</hi> or I might say perhaps in the Kingdom, can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63904:3"/>
Ignorance concerning them, or deny them to be true.</p>
            <p>Mr. TOLAND was scarcely arriv'd in that Country, when he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self warmly attack'd from the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> which at the beginning could not but startle the People, who till then were equal Strangers to him and his Book; yet they became in a little time so well accustom'd to this Subject, that it was as much expected of course as if it had been prescrib'd in the Rubrick. This occasion'd a Noble Lord to give it for a reason why he frequented not the Church as formerly, that, instead of his Saviour JESUS CHRIST, one <hi>IOHN TOLAND</hi> was all the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course there. But how unworthy a Member soever of the <hi>Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> Mr. TOLAND may be, he's still so sensible of the Obedience he justly owes to its most Divine Precepts, that he dares not allow himself to make any returns in the same Dialect to what was liberally utter'd against him in that place.<note place="margin">Jude 9.</note> We read, an <hi>Archangel</hi> was not permitted to rail against the very <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi>; and if Mr. TOLAND had not innumerable Passages of the <hi>Gospel</hi> to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63904:3"/>
restrain him, yet the Reverence all Men ow to their own Persons join'd to the Rules of common Civility, would be powerful enough to keep him from bestowing any indecent Expressions or Reflections upon his Opposers. Nor is he such a stranger to the former Ages or the present, as not to perceive that passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate or violent Proceedings never yet gain'd Credit to a <hi>Cause</hi>; nor produc'd any other Effects upon the Enemies of it, but to make 'em abhor it the more.</p>
            <p>But when this rough handling of him in the <hi>Pulpit</hi> (where he could not have word about) prov'd insignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, the <hi>Grand Iury</hi> was sollicited to present him for a Book that was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and publish'd in <hi>England.</hi> And to gain the readier Compliance, the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment of the <hi>Grand Iury</hi> of <hi>Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sex</hi> was printed in <hi>Dublin</hi> with an emphatical Title, and cry'd about the Streets. So Mr. TOLAND was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly presented there the last day of the Term in the Court of <hi>King's-Bench,</hi> the <hi>Iurors</hi> not grounding their proceeding upon any particular Passages of his Book, which most of 'em never read, and those that did confess'd not
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63904:4"/>
to understand. Thus in the Reign of HENRY VI. one <note n="*" place="bottom">Bacon<hi>'s Historical Discourse of the Government of</hi> England, <hi>Part</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 17. <hi>pag.</hi> 161.</note> JOHN STEPHENS was presented by a Jury in <hi>Southwark,</hi> as a Man, say they, <hi>we know not what to make of him, and that hath Books we know not what they are.</hi> In the mean time those of either Sex who had any intimacy with Mr. TOLAND, or that favour'd him with their familiar Conversation, were branded as his Proselytes, and Lists of their Names industriously given about; altho those worthy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons (for he always chose the best Company) had never discours'd him of Religion, nor had many of 'em then seen his Book. And so far was he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self from making his Opinions the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his common Talk, that, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding repeated Provocations, he purposely declin'd speaking of 'em at all; which made his Adversaries (who slipt no handle of decrying him) insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate that he was not the real Author of the Piece going under his Name. But if they were serious, and this was not another Artifice to make him own it, I would fain know what made them
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:63904:4"/>
so angry with a Man whom they ought therefore to despise: For if there be any Poison (as I hope there is none) in that Book, the spreading of it in <hi>Ireland</hi> is wholly owing to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of those, who would be thought most to oppose it.</p>
            <p>We must not forget that in a few days after the present <hi>Lords Iustices</hi> of that Kingdom landed, the Recorder of <hi>Dublin,</hi> Mr. HANCOCK, presented Mr. TOLAND to their Excellencies after a very obliging manner; for in his Congratulatory Harangue in the name of his Corporation, whereof by the way he spoke not a word, he begg'd their <hi>Lordships</hi> would protect the CHURCH from all its Enemies, but particularly from the TOLANDISTS, a Sect, I'm sure, those Noble Persons ne'er heard of before. The late <hi>Lords Iustices,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Montrath</hi> and <hi>Drogheda,</hi> were more neglected at least in the same Speech; tho all <hi>Ireland</hi> cannot without the blackest Ingratitude but acknowledg, that they never liv'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore under a more prudent, just, and peaceable Administration: For as they gave no occasions of Complaint in their
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:63904:5"/>
Government, so were there no Murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings against them but only of such, as, through a perpetual desire of Change, are always Enemies to their own and the Country's Happiness. Mr. TO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND being thus made a <hi>Heresiarch</hi> in so publick a place, where all the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Gentry of the Kingdom then in Town were present, occasion'd every body to hunt for his Book which was very scarce; and his Enemies also took that Pretext of denominating all his Acquaintance TOLANDISTS, how different soever they were from him or one another in their Sentiments.</p>
            <p>From the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> from the <hi>Iury,</hi> and the <hi>Court,</hi> he must take his next turn at the <hi>Press,</hi> from whence there issu'd a Book said to be an Answer to him in particular, and to all others who set up <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Evidence</hi> in opposition to <hi>Revelation</hi> and <hi>Mysteries.</hi> This im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports that Mr. TOLAND made <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Revelation</hi> contradictory. But how well the Author of the said Book, Mr. PETER BROWN, <hi>senior Fellow of Trinity College near</hi> Dublin, has prov'd this or the rest of his Undertaking, is referr'd to the impartial Reader's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:63904:5"/>
If hard Language would do instead of strong Arguments, we might easily determine who had the better end of the Controversy; and if you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Mr. BROWN himself, he assures you that <hi>if it can be shewn where one Link of his reasoning fails,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 81.</note> 
               <hi>he'll make it up again so firm, that it shall never be undone.</hi> Indeed I don't believe Mr. TO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND designs to give him any trouble of that kind, so that his <hi>Reasons</hi> are like to continue as good as ever they were. But Mr. BROWN'S Book comes now under Consideration as it was one of the Machines invented to render Mr. TOLAND dangerous or odious. And this he does not only by endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring all along to prove him <hi>a most inveterate Enemy to all Reveal'd Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>;<note place="margin">Pag. 79.</note> but he expresly solicits the Civil Magistrate to take a course with him, which looks not very generous in an <hi>Answerer,</hi> how much concern soever he may pretend for his Faith. In one place he says,<note place="margin">Pag. 139.</note> 
               <hi>I have no more to do here but to deliver him up into the hands of our Governors. We may confute his Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, but 'tis they only can suppress his Insolence; we only can endeavour to heal
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:63904:6"/>
those already infected, 'tis they alone can hinder the Infection from spreading fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> And afterwards he adds,<note place="margin">Pag. 144.</note> 
               <hi>Here again I would deliver him into the hands of the Magistrate, not mov'd by any heat of Passion, but by such a</hi> Zeal <hi>as becomes every Christian to have for his Religion.</hi> I am fully satisfy'd this <hi>murdering Zeal</hi> is not inspir'd by Genuine <hi>Christianity</hi>; and as for his want of Passion, the <hi>Inquisitors</hi> themselves shew as much seeming Reluctance against killing or maiming of those whom they procure to be condemn'd for <hi>Hereticks.</hi> At the very instant they deliver 'em over to the Secular Power, they address them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the Magistrate in these terms; <hi>We most earnestly beseech you, my Lord Iudg, that for the love of God, and from a sense of Piety and Mercy, as well as out of regard to our Entreaties, you would neither inflict the loss of Life or Limb upon this miserable Creature</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Domine Judex, rogamus vos cum omni affectu quo possimus, ut amore Dei, pietaris &amp; misericordiae intuitu, &amp; nostrorum interventu precaminum, miser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimo huic nullum mortis vel mutilationis periculum inferatis.</note>. Tho at the same time, if the Judg should take
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:63904:6"/>
the holy Fathers at their word, they would infallibly excommunicate him for his ready Obedience, whereof they are so fond in all cases but those of <hi>Iustice and Clemency,</hi> which is the Mot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to of their Standard. Here we may observe how strangely Words of a good signification may be detorted to countenance very ill Actions. Thus to abuse a Man is in the Language of some term'd <hi>Zeal,</hi> and so it is to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him in that of others; nor were the barbarous <hi>Irish</hi> wanting to sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy their <hi>Massacre</hi> by that Name.</p>
            <p>But lest the broaching of simple <hi>Heresies</hi> should not serve the turn, Mr. TOLAND must by all means be made the <hi>Head of a Sect,</hi> and of no ordinary one; for, if you credit Mr. BROWN,<note place="margin">Pag. 162.</note> he designs to be <hi>as famous an Impostor as</hi> MAHOMET. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm this Character, which was well enough invented to amuse the People with vain Terrors, there was a ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Story handed about, whether true or false God knows; for Mr. TO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND remembers nothing of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. 'Tis said, in short, that about the fourteenth Year of his Age he
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63904:7"/>
gravely declar'd he would be the <hi>Head of a Sect</hi> e'er he was Thirty; and before he was forty he should make as great a stir in the Commonwealth as CROMWEL ever did. <hi>Risum teneatis.</hi> Here's an old Prophecy found in a Bog with a witness, and which Mr. HAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>COCK and Mr. BROWN have labour'd to fulfil in part, that superstitious Folks might trepidly apprehend the event of the rest.<note place="margin">Pag. 164.</note> Mr. BROWN says, <hi>The real design of this Man is plainly no other than what he</hi> formerly declar'd, <hi>and what he openly affects, to be the</hi> Head <hi>of a</hi> Sect; and doubts not but <hi>he has a great deal more to say,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 166.</note> 
               <hi>whenever this new</hi> Sect <hi>of his becomes so numerous that they shall outbrave the Laws, and labour for a publick Reformation of the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Doctrines of the Gospel.</hi> Would any body believe this, did they not see it plainly own'd in Print?<note place="margin">Pag. 121.</note> Nay he tells us that <hi>he has trac'd</hi> this Heresiarch <hi>from the time he first gave out he would be</hi> Head <hi>of a</hi> Sect <hi>before he was thirty Years of Age, till he became an Author, and from thence to his coming into</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>to spread his Heresies, and put his Design in execution.</hi> I assure him he
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:63904:7"/>
wants two Years still of Thirty, and if his <hi>Disciples</hi> (as they're call'd) take not other measures than he did to erect that same Sect in <hi>Ireland,</hi> St. PATRICK may securely possess his Apostleship in that Kingdom till Doomsday, which is an Honour Mr. TOLAND does not envy him. I ought not by any means to forget here the Sagacity of a certain Gentleman, who wonder'd at his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence for presuming to set up a <hi>new Religion</hi> in their Country, where he had not a foot of Land; which inclines me to believe he has met with better Records of the Apostles Possessions than Mr. TOLAND could in all his reading.</p>
            <p>Well then, if all this wo'nt do, what shall we make of him next? He must e'en be represented as dangerous to the Government; and truly so he's like to be if <hi>Irish</hi> Presages hold good, for their Prophecies were never worth a farthing.<note place="margin">Pag. 172.</note> 
               <hi>How far Men in power,</hi> says Mr. BROWN, <hi>according to their several Stations, are oblig'd to intermeddle in point of Conscience, I shall not now enquire. But sure I am in point of Policy it is become no less than necessary: for the Writers of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:63904:8"/>
this strain have given broad hints that they are as little friends to our Government, as our Religion. This Man can say that</hi> MAGISTRATES are made for the PEOPLE, <hi>and every one knows what Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of</hi> REBELLION <hi>Men are wont to insinuate by this</hi> SAYING. O! is it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts then? Why truly, the Doctrine of <hi>Passive Obedience</hi> was exploded by this same <hi>Saying,</hi> which Mr. TOLAND acknowledges to be one fair Quotation. JAMES the Second was justly abdica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted according to this Saying, because he was an Enemy to the <hi>People</hi> for whom he was made a <hi>King</hi>; and our most Glorious Hero WILLIAM the Third, the Restorer of Universal Peace and Liberty, was invested with the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Power by the honest <hi>People</hi> of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> for whose good he has indefatigably employ'd it ever since, in vindicating, settling, and enlarging their Civil and Religious Rights. Mr. BROWN has been pleas'd to say that Mr. TOLAND was proud of run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning down three Kingdoms with one cross Question,<note place="margin">Pag. 123.</note> which is, <hi>How can a Man believe what he does not know?</hi> and he that does so, knows not what he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:63904:8"/>
Now I would gladly be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd by him, for whom the <hi>Magis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates</hi> are made unless for the <hi>People?</hi> Were they made for themselves? or whether the <hi>People</hi> were made for the <hi>Magistrates?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 172.</note> But he adds, <hi>that this sort of Men deserve to be look'd to, that their numbers grow formidable</hi>; and makes little doubt but <hi>their design is at length to shew us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 173.</note> 
               <hi>That all Dominion as well as Religion is founded in Reason.</hi> Let him assure himself they will never begin to shew that, for they have clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prov'd it long ago. What Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is not founded in Reason, must be doubtless unreasonable, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently Tyrannical. There was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more reasonable than for Men first to unite themselves into Societies for their mutual Peace and Security against the Violence or Fraud of others. And as reasonable it was that they should agree upon certain Rules, or frame Constitutions which were to be the known Standard of every bodies Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and might serve for the Decision of all their Differences. That there should be Magistrates or indifferent Persons appointed to preserve those
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:63904:9"/>
Laws, and see 'em put in execution (not leaving every Man to be his own Judg) is not less reasonable still. And that all due Honour and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence should be paid to those Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors by their Subjects, is likewise most highly reasonable; so that I fancy we must necessarily conclude <hi>all just Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion to be founded in Reason.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At length comes from the North a finish'd Master of such Politicks, and he doubts not but Mr. TOLAND after all is a <hi>Iesuit.</hi> But his Book utterly destroys all the Principles of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Superstition.</hi> That's nothing; for <hi>Iesuits</hi> to unsettle us will preach against their own Religion. Now if Mr. TO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND be a <hi>Iesuit,</hi> he's certainly the most dangerous of the Order, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun extremely betimes. He was not sixteen Years old when he became as zealous against <hi>Popery</hi> as he has ever since continu'd, and by God's Assistance always will do. From <hi>Redcastle</hi> near <hi>Londonderry</hi> he went in 1687. to the College of <hi>Glasco</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi>; and upon his departure from it the Magistrates of that City gave him Recommendatory Letters, wherein they took particular
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:63904:9"/>
notice of his Affection to the <hi>Protestant Religion.</hi> The day before the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Battle of the <hi>BOINE,</hi> he was created <hi>Master of Arts</hi> at <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> and receiv'd the usual <hi>Diploma</hi> or Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate from the <hi>Professors.</hi> Then he came into <hi>England,</hi> and liv'd in as good <hi>Protestant</hi> Families as any in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, till he went to the famous Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity of <hi>Leyden</hi> in <hi>HOLLAND</hi> to perfect his Studies; and upon his return from thence lodg'd in a private House at <hi>Oxford</hi> till about two Years ago he came to <hi>London,</hi> where, 'tis well known, his Company and Conversation were the farthest in the World from being <hi>Iesui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical.</hi> Notwithstanding the whole series of his Education, as well as his own Genius, did thus run in the most op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite Channel to <hi>Popery</hi>; yet in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> that malicious Report gain'd upon some few, because his Relations were <hi>Papists,</hi> and that he happen'd to be so brought up himself in his Childhood, which was no more an Action of his own, than that he was born there. So his Countrymen treated him in this respect like his Majesty's good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of <hi>Guernsey,</hi> who, when they are
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:63904:10"/>
in <hi>France</hi> are call'd English Rogues, and in <hi>England</hi> French Dogs.</p>
            <p>The last Effort, except the charge of <hi>Socinianism,</hi> to blast him, was to make him pass for a rigid <hi>Nonconformist.</hi> Mr. TOLAND will never deny but the real Simplicity of the <hi>Dissenters</hi> Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and the seeming Equity of their Discipline (into which being so young he could not distinctly penetrate) did gain extraordinarily upon his Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, just as he was newly deliver'd from the insupportable Yoke of the most pompous and Tyrannical <hi>Policy</hi> that ever enslav'd Mankind under the name or shew of <hi>Religion.</hi> But when greater Experience and more Years had a little ripen'd his Judgment, he easily perceiv'd that the Differences were not so wide as to appear irreconcileable, or at least, that Men, who were sound <hi>Protestants</hi> on both sides, should barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously cut one anothers Throats, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed give any disturbance to the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty about them. And as soon as he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood the late Heats and Animosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties did not totally (if at all) proceed from a Concern for meer Religion, he allow'd himself a latitude in several
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:63904:10"/>
things, that would have been matter of scruple to him before. His Travels increas'd, and the Study of Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal History perfected this Disposition, wherein he continues to this hour: for, whatever his own Opinion of those Differences be, yet he finds so essential an Agreement between the <hi>French, Dutch, English, Scotish,</hi> and other <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,</hi> that he's resolv'd never to lose the benefit of an Instructive Discourse in any of their Churches upon that score; and it must be a Civil not a Religious Interest that can engage him against any of these Parties, not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all their private Notions wherein they disagree worth endangering, much less subverting, the Publick Peace of a Nation. If this makes a Man a <hi>Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formist,</hi> then Mr. TOLAND is one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionably. And so he is, if he thinks the <hi>Dissenters</hi> ought not to be molested in their Goods or Persons, nor excluded from any of their Native Rights, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they have a different Set of Thoughts from him or others, so long as none of their Principles are repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to good Government. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves them likewise to be a true and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:63904:11"/>
considerable part of the <hi>Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> (for they have demonstrated themselves to be stanch <hi>Patriots</hi>) not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding any Error or Weakness whereof they may be guilty in his Judgment. But this same reason will prove him as sound a Member of the establish'd Church of <hi>England</hi>; being perswaded the narrow Sentiments of a few about <hi>Communion</hi> is not any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest Doctrin of that Church: nor would there be any Separation from it in this Realm, were all others of his mind. 'Tis visible this Declaration is not made to curry favour with one (as many do) while in their Hearts they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to the other side. But Mr. TO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND's Opinion being frequently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded as to this Point, he now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers it once for all; for he will never condescend to court any body of Men with preference to all others, further than he sees ground for it: and to this, as his settl'd Judgment, he's resolv'd to adhere, tho it should hazard the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable ruin of his Fortune or Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation with all Parties.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Atheism</hi> is now become so common an Accusation in every Person's mouth,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:63904:11"/>
who is displeas'd at the Rudeness of others for not complimenting him with their Assent to his Opinions, that, altho in it self it be the most atrocious and unnatural Crime whereof a reasonable Creature can be guilty, yet is it not otherwise minded than as a word of course which indicates a world of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerateness and Rancor. When Mr. TOLAND us'd to be traduc'd in <hi>Ireland</hi> for <hi>Deism</hi> with many other Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and his Friends demanded of his Accusers where they made those Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries in his Writings, the ready An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer always was, that truly they had never read the Book, and by the Grace of God never would; but that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd their Information from such as were proper Judges of the thing. O how inseparable is <hi>Popery</hi> from <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance!</hi> And what is the source of all <hi>Popery,</hi> but <hi>Implicit Belief</hi> where-ever it is found? As to what the Author of the Letter to a Convocation-man says of a Congregation <hi>de propaganda Infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate,</hi> no body needs be asham'd of so good Company as the present Bishop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> the late Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the <hi>Commons</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:63904:12"/>
themselves, whom he not only libels with most false and vile Insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but even his Majesty's own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son as a Prince of no Religion, which none that had any Religion durst say of a King who is so great a friend to it by his Patronage and Example. Mr. TOLAND was once writing an Answer to this Author; but he laid aside his Papers when he understood that such able Men had undertaken him, as the Reverend Dr. WAKE, and the Ingenious Author of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to a Parliament Man.</p>
            <p>But some People not being satisfy'd, it seems, with all that past, and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mr. TOLAND should never have enough on't, concluded at last to bring his Book before the <hi>Parliament.</hi> And therefore on Saturday the 14<hi>th</hi> day of <hi>August,</hi> it was mov'd in the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Religion,</hi> that the Book en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titul'd <hi>Christianity not Mysterious,</hi> should be brought before them, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it was order'd that the said Book should the Saturday following be brought into the <hi>Committee.</hi> That day the Committee sat not; but the next Saturday, which was the 28<hi>th</hi> day
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:63904:12"/>
of <hi>August,</hi> there met a very full <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee,</hi> wherein this business was a great while debated. Several Persons eminent for their Birth, good Qualities, or Fortunes, oppos'd the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, being of opinion it was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proper nor convenient for them to meddle with a thing of that nature. But when this Point was without much Argument carri'd against them, they insisted that the Passages which gave Offence in the Book should be read; so those wonderful Objections were made which are clear'd in the <hi>Letter</hi> subjoin'd: and then the <hi>Committee</hi> was adjourn'd till the 4<hi>th</hi> of <hi>September.</hi> That day, after several Gentlemen had spoke to those Objections, they urg'd at last, according to Mr. TOLAND'S own desire, that he should be call'd to answer in Person, to declare the Sense of his Book, and his Design in writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. But this favour being pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily deny'd, an <hi>Honourable Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> went to the Bar, and offer'd a <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> to be read which he had receiv'd that Morning from Mr. TOLAND, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining what Satisfaction he intended to give the <hi>Committee,</hi> had they thought
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:63904:13"/>
fit to let him speak for himself. But this was likewise refus'd, and the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee</hi> came immediately to those Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions, to which the House agreed after some Debate on Thursday fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing being the 9<hi>th</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> viz. <hi>That the Book entitul'd</hi> Christianity not Mysterious,<note place="margin">Votes of the H. of C. of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>containing several He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical Doctrines contrary to the Christian Religion and the establish'd Church of</hi> Ireland, <hi>be publickly burnt by the hands of the Common Hangman.</hi> Likewise, <hi>That the Author thereof</hi> JOHN TO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND <hi>be taken into the Custody of the Serjeant at Arms</hi> (which he took care to prevent) <hi>and be prosecuted by Mr. At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney General for writing and publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the said Book.</hi> They order'd too <hi>that an Address should be made to the Lords Iustices to give Directions that no more Copies of that Book be brought into the Kingdom, and to prevent the selling of those already imported.</hi> Their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was executed on the Book the Saturday following, which was the 11<hi>th</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> before the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-House</hi> Gate, and also in the open Street before the <hi>Town-house</hi>; the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs and all the Constables attending.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:63904:13"/>One very singular Passage we must not omit, which is, that the same day the Book was to be condemn'd there came abroad a printed Sheet, wherein, to terrify any body from appearing publickly for Mr. TOLAND, were contain'd the following words: <hi>Now let those consider this,</hi> says the Writer of that Paper, <hi>whether within doors or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; and whether the Vindication or even the excusing this Book or the Author,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A Letter upon Mr. <hi>Toland</hi>'s Book to <hi>I. C.</hi> 
                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> 
                  <hi>pag.</hi> 4.</note> 
               <hi>or the ridiculing or otherwise baffling the just Prosecution or Censure of it and him, be not truly the denying of our Saviour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Men, and whether such may not as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredly expect to be deny'd of him in the presence of his Father, and the holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and all the World at the last day.</hi> This strange Denunciation had no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect upon those who all along appear'd in Mr. TOLAND'S behalf, tho much out-number'd by those of the contrary Opinion. In the <hi>Committee</hi> it was mov'd by one that Mr. TOLAND himself should be burnt, as by another that he should be made to burn his Book with his own hands; and a third desir'd it should be done before the Door of the House, that he might have the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:63904:14"/>
of treading the Ashes under his feet.</p>
            <p>I forbear making any Remarks here either upon the design of burning Books in general, or this in particular; nor will I shew, as well I might, how fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less this sort of proceeding has prov'd in all Ages, since the Custom was first introduc'd by the <hi>Popish Inquisitors,</hi> who perform'd that Execution on the Book when they could not seize the Author whom they had destin'd to the Flames. Neither will I insist upon the great Stop and Discouragement which this Practice brings to all Learning and Discoveries; but, without further Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, I shall now leave the Reader to peruse Mr. TOLAND'S <hi>Letter,</hi> and to judg for himself whether it would have given him satisfaction, had he been a Member of the <hi>House of Commons.</hi>

                  </opener>
                  <p>WHen the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> is attack'd by Atheists and others, they constantly charge it with <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi> or <hi>Obscurity</hi>; and Mr. TO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND'S design in the Publication of his Book was to defend <hi>Christianity</hi> from such unjust Imputations, as he more than once declares in his Preface, and as he thinks it every Christian's Duty to do, according to his Ability or Opportunity. If we might judg of his Performance by his profest In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, we should conclude it to be extraordinary good; but we must on the other hand reckon it as bad, if, without further Examination, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the strange Out-cries that are
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:63904:15"/>
made against it both from the <hi>Pulpit</hi> and the <hi>Press.</hi> That a Man should be run down because it is the fashion, or by <hi>Interested</hi> Persons, and such as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenc'd by 'em, is nothing strange; for one way or other the like happens eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day: but that a Book should be condemn'd by wholesale, without assigning the particular Faults or Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes in it, and by many that never read it, is visibly unjust. What has contributed to make Mr. TOLAND (whom neither his Age, nor Fortune, nor Preferment renders formidable) the Object of so much Heat and Noise, and after what manner his Enemies of all sorts have treated him under a zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pretence, he's like very speedily to inform such of the World as will please to concern themselves. But not considering the Honourable <hi>House of Commons,</hi> or your self in particular, among the number of his <hi>Adversaries</hi> but as his <hi>Iudges,</hi> he thinks convenient to clear those few Points which are reported to afford matter of Exception to some in the <hi>Committee of Religion.</hi> But, before this be done, he desires that two or three Particulars may be a little consider'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:63904:15"/>Mr. TOLAND, in the first place, is of opinion it portends much Happiness to the Nation, that the <hi>Commons</hi> (who have all the right imaginable to it) should take the cognizance of such things into their own Hands. And tho his Book should, as it's very probable, happen to fall under their Censure, yet his love to Mankind cannot but make him extremely pleas'd with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences he foresees must necessarily follow from such an authentick Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in this Country, where it was most peculiarly wanting. Nor does he think it more reasonable for him to be angry at his private ill luck, than it would be for some to be out of love with <hi>Parliaments</hi> themselves (which is the best Constitution in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse) because they are <hi>mistaken</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and that an Act is <hi>repeal'd</hi> in one Session which was establish'd in another; not considering that such an Inconvenience is infinitely overbal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanc'd by several excellent Laws, and by the Remedy that may likewise be had to this pretended Disorder from that very Court, upon better <hi>Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> or <hi>Temper.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:63904:16"/>Secondly, Mr. TOLAND does not complain that he alone in the Kingdom is disturb'd for his Opinion, but is heartily glad that no more are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bl'd upon that account. For as he takes <hi>Persecution</hi> to be one of the chief Marks and Pillars of the <hi>Antichristian Church,</hi> so he looks upon an impartial <hi>Liberty</hi> of writing and speaking what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is not destructive of <hi>Civil Society,</hi> to be the greatest advantage of any Country, whether the Learning, or the Commerce, or the very Peace and Tranquillity thereof be consider'd.
<q>Yet it cannot but look mighty odly to indifferent Persons,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Left out in the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Copy.</hi>
                        </note> that all the <hi>Dissenters</hi> from the Establish'd Church, that the <hi>Papists</hi> who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert Christianity it self, that several declar'd <hi>Socinian,</hi> ay and <hi>Iacobite</hi> Pamphlets should escape the burning Zeal of those, who so furiously pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute one young Man only for the suspected Consequences of his Book, as if the very Being or Destruction of all <hi>Religion</hi> depended upon the fate of him, or his Writings.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, As for the <hi>Errors</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly laid to Mr. TOLAND'S charge,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:63904:16"/>
they are so various and inconsistent with one another, that no Man of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary sense could possibly hold them all at a time; and being credited by his Enemies without book, he may with more Justice deny than they can affirm them. He's not therefore oblig'd to take notice of any thing but what is alledg'd in formal words, or plainly inferr'd from his Book. Indeed some Consequences an Author might not perceive, which should render him the more excusable; but Mr. TOLAND confesses he foresaw several Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of his Book, even to part of the Opposition with which it has met, tho not that (after the Pulpits, Presses, and Juries) the <hi>Commons</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> should likewise honour it with their Animadversion.</p>
                  <p>Now what is said to have been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected in the <hi>Committee</hi> is, First, That the very Title <hi>CHRISTIANITY NOT MYSTERIOVS</hi> is Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical. Whether the Committee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees a new or declares an old <hi>Heresy,</hi> Mr. TOLAND neither knows nor is much concern'd to understand, being conscious to himself of neither. If the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:63904:17"/>
                     <hi>Title</hi> be made good in the Book, 'tis orthodox or sound enough; and if not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet he's still to seek for the <hi>Heresy</hi> of it.
<q>If it be an old Opinion;<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Left out in the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Copy.</hi>

But 'tis affirm'd that by his <hi>Title</hi> he rejects the <hi>Mysteries</hi> of the Gospel. If by <hi>Mysteries</hi> be meant the <hi>Doctrines</hi> themselves, he denies none of them; but that after Revelation they are not <hi>mysterious</hi> or obscure, he still maintains for the Honour of <hi>Christianity.</hi> A great many without doors very wisely conclude that he believes not the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, because he thinks they are <hi>plain,</hi> and therefore the more <hi>credible</hi>; for that's all he means by <hi>not mysterious.</hi> But some People, otherwise credulous enough, believe no body capable of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring that clear and easy, which to themselves seems difficult or insupera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>

                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:63904:17"/>It was likewise objected that he makes a doubt whether the <hi>Scriptures</hi> be of Divine Authority. That bare Expression, <hi>If the Gospel be really the Word of God,</hi> imports no such matter, but very frequently the contrary; as for example, <hi>If the Gospel be true this frame of the World shall be dissolv'd,</hi> which is not to question, but more emphatically to assert the truth of the Proposition. But this, I confess, is nothing to the case before us. The words in the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Book are these,<note place="margin">Pag. 170.</note> 
                     <hi>Nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory or inconceivable, however made an Article of Faith, can be contain'd in the Gospel, if it be really the Word of God: for I have hitherto argu'd only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Supposition, for the Reason to be seen towards the end of the Preface.</hi> The sense of the words then must be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd by that Reason; and the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage referr'd to in the Preface is this, <hi>viz. In the following Discourse which is the first of three,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pres.</hi> p. 24.</note> &amp;c. <hi>the Divinity of the New Testament is taken for granted. In the next Discourse,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I attempt a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and rational Explanation of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Mysteries of the Gospel. And in the third, I demonstrate the Verity of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:63904:18"/>
Divine Revelation against Atheists and all Enemies of Reveal'd Religion.</hi> Now is it not something strange that a Man should question what he takes for granted, and which the Method he follow'd would not permit him to prove before his time, that is, not form the Conclusion before the Premisses? In one place he positively affirms the <hi>Scriptures to contain the brightest Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of Divinity</hi>;<note place="margin">Pag. 33.</note> but that the force of Calumny may evidently appear, let this other Passage of the same Book be consider'd:<note place="margin">Pag. 46.</note> 
                     <hi>What we discours'd of Reason before,</hi> says he, <hi>and Revelation now being duly weigh'd, all the Doctrines and Precepts of the New Testament (if it be indeed Divine) must consequently agree with Natural Reason and our own ordinary Ideas. THIS every considerate and well-dispos'd Person will find by the careful perusal of it, and whoever under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes this Task will confess the Gospel not to be HIDDEN from us, nor afar off; but very nigh us in our Mouths and in our HEARTS.</hi> But this whole Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter must have been transcrib'd, were all that's to our purpose in it to be nicely quoted; for every word of it from
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:63904:18"/>
N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 22. to the end, is a Justification of the Method and Stile of the <hi>New Testament.</hi> Yet lest any suspicion of Fallacy might remain where the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle <hi>IF</hi> occurs, I demand what Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration can be conceiv'd in stronger terms than the following Passage? for you shall be troubl'd with no more, tho I might easily cite forty others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to this Head. The words are, <hi>Whether or no Christianity is mysterious ought to be naturally decided by the New Testament,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pag. 88.</note> 
                     <hi>wherein the Christian Faith is originally contain'd. I heartily desire to put the Case upon this Issue, I appeal to this Tribunal; for did I not infinitely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Truth I learn from these sacred Records to all other Considerations, I should never assert that there are no Mys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries in Christianity. The Scriptures have engag'd me in this Error, if it be one; and I will sooner be reputed Hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox with these only on my side, than to pass for Orthodox with the whole World, and have them against me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was likewise objected that Mr. TOLAND shew'd not a due Respect to CHRIST, because he always stiles him in his Book barely CHRIST, or
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:63904:19"/>
at most only JESUS CHRIST. If this be any Disrespect, the most Orthodox Divines are as guilty of it in their Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and the <hi>Apostles</hi> themselves speak of him without any additional Titles a great many times in the Gospel. 'Tis otherwise, I grant, when some special occasion requires them to be more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press; and when Mr. TOLAND was declaring the Head of his Church, he says,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pref. p.</hi> 26.</note> 
                     <hi>I am neither of</hi> Paul, <hi>nor of</hi> Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas, <hi>nor of</hi> Apollos, <hi>but of the Lord IESVS CHRIST alone, who is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and Finisher of my Faith.</hi> And here I cannot forbear admiring how Mr. TOLAND should be deem'd an <hi>Arian</hi> or <hi>Socinian,</hi> seeing, for ought ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in his Book, he may lay a better Claim to any other Sect, except the <hi>Papists,</hi> than to them; for these three are the only Parties he opposes by name. But if his Religion is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally discover'd by his Book, 'tis utterly impossible he should be either an <hi>Arian</hi> or <hi>Socinian.</hi> They both of 'em (from different Notions) believe JESUS CHRIST to be a meer Creature God, which Mr. TOLAND does not; and, to mend one Absurdity by a
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:63904:19"/>
greater, they join in paying their Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd Creature Divine Worship, which Mr. TOLAND judges impious and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous. His own words are these; <hi>Tho the Socinians disown this Practice</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pag. 27.</note> (of admitting Contradictions in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion) <hi>I am mistaken if either they or the Arians can make their Notions of a Dignify'd and Creature God capable of Divine Worship, appear more reasonable than the extravagancies of other Sects touching the Article of the Trinity</hi>; such as the Whimsies of <hi>EVTYCHES, GENTILIS,</hi> and the rest. In short, Mr. TOLAND had no natural occasion to declare his Sentiments relating to CHRIST's Person, that and the other particular Doctrines of the Gospel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Subject of the second and third Books he promises, and by which alone his Conformity or Dissent with the <hi>Common Christianity</hi> is to be discern'd. Nor had his Adversaries from the Press run into so many gross Mistakes, and been at the trouble of several no less unhappy than needless Conjectures, had they but Patience or Phlegm e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to attend the Publication of those Pieces.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:63904:20"/>It was objected also that he slighted the <hi>Sacraments</hi> (which is a term he never uses) by making them bare <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies.</hi> That he call'd 'em any where meer <hi>Ceremonies</hi> he absolutely denies, tho he now affirms with all Christians, that the Actions of <hi>breaking Bread</hi> and <hi>washing with Water</hi> are as much Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial under the <hi>New Testament,</hi> as <hi>Circumcision</hi> or the <hi>Passover</hi> were under the <hi>Old.</hi> But when Mr. TOLAND had a just occasion to mention the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,</hi> tho not to declare his Opinion concerning their Nature or Efficacy, 'tis evident he speaks there of those numerous <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of Human Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution which were added to 'em by the mistaken Zeal or Prudence of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Christians,<note place="margin">Pag. 153.</note> 
                     <hi>who,</hi> as he says, <hi>not having the least Precedent for any Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies from the Gospel, excepting Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism and the Supper, strangely disguis'd and transform'd these by adding to them the Pagan Mystick Rites</hi>; and of these appending Ceremonies he gives a large Catalogue in that Chapter. But he's so far from making any comparison be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Christianity</hi> and the <hi>Orgies</hi> of BACCHUS, as was likewise alledg'd,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:63904:20"/>
that on the contrary he severely handles those who blended such Corruptions with pure Christianity.<note place="margin">Pag. 153.</note> 
                     <hi>Thus,</hi> says he, <hi>lest Simplicity, the noblest Ornament of the Truth, should expose it to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Vnbelievers, Christianity was put upon an equal level with the Mysteries of</hi> CERES, <hi>or the Orgies of</hi> BACCHUS. To this may be added another Passage, where he affirms <hi>he could draw his Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel between Heathenism and those early Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions much larger,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pag. 162, 163.</note> 
                     <hi>to shew how Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity became mysterious, and how so Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine an Institution did, through the Craft and Ambition of Priests and Philosophers, degenerate into meer Paganism.</hi> Here, you see, 'tis not the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> but the unwarrantable <hi>Additions</hi> to it, wherein JESUS CHRIST never had any hand, which he compares with the <hi>Mysteries</hi> of CERES and the <hi>Orgies</hi> of BACCHUS. And what, pray, is the main body of the <hi>Popish, Eastern,</hi> or other Superstitions, but the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of those Rites of <hi>Heathen</hi> or <hi>Iewish</hi> Original which Mr. TOLAND justly explodes? Or is any body that draws a Parallel between <hi>Heathenism</hi> and <hi>Popery</hi> thought disaffected to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:63904:21"/>
Christianity? Indeed <hi>profest</hi> or <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis'd Papists</hi> will accuse him of such a Crime, but no <hi>understanding Protestant</hi> can ever be guilty of so much Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                  <p>'Tis possible more Exceptions were made to Mr. TOLAND'S Book in the <hi>Committee,</hi> or these not all in this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; but these were all whereof he could inform himself, and of which he gives the most compendious and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory account he can: being as ready to do the same in relation to all other Objections that shall fairly come to his knowledg. The greatest Hardship he complains of is, that, being an Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant of <hi>England,</hi> he should be molested in <hi>Ireland</hi> (where he was only fortui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tously born) for a Book he publish'd in another Country. His Errand hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, God knows, was neither to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate nor receive any Doctrines, new or old; and as he was far from ever designing to fix his constant Residence here, so he thinks himself liable to be disturb'd in any other place, whither his Curiosity or Business may lead him, as in this Kingdom; which is a way of proceeding hitherto unheard of in the

            <p>THere was enough said in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding <hi>Letter</hi> concerning the <hi>Socinianism</hi> laid to Mr. TOLAND'S Charge, and I doubt very much whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther now there be any <hi>Socinians</hi> in <hi>England</hi>; I am sure, no considerable Body of them: for the Theology of the <hi>Vnitarians,</hi> who vulgarly pass un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that name, is very different from that of SOCINUS. But these <hi>Vnita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> in one of their latest Prints dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own any Service intended their Cause by Mr. TOLAND'S Book; and all Sects, we know, are ready upon the least apparent Conformity to augment
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:63904:22"/>
their own Numbers, especially with such as they seem to value for their Learning or other Qualifications. In <hi>The Agreement of the Vnitarians with the Catholick Church</hi> occurs the following Paragraph.<note place="margin">P. 54, 55.</note>
               <q>The (Bishop of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester</hi>'s) eighth and tenth Chapters, are employ'd in opposing, and, as he thinks, in exposing and ridiculing some Interpretations of a few Texts of Scripture by the <hi>Vnitarians</hi>; and attacking a few Paragraphs in Mr. TOLAND'S Book, <hi>Christianity not Mysterious.</hi> I know not what it was to his Lordship's purpose to fall upon Mr. TOLAND'S Book. But if he would needs attack the Book, he should have dealt fairly. He should have discuss'd the main Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument in it, and not carpt only at a few Passages; and those too so mangl'd and deform'd by his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation of them, that I dare to affirm Mr. TOLAND does not know his own Book in the Bishop's Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation of it. I do not perceive, to speak truly, but that Book still stands in its full strength; if it has not also acquir'd a farther Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:63904:22"/>
by occasion of this so unsuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful nibling at it. But suppose the <hi>Bishop</hi> had disarm'd the <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, what is that to us? Do we offer this Book against the Trinity of the Realists? Was it written with Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to serve us? Does it contain any of our Allegations from Reason, against the Trinity of</hi> Philoponus, Joachim, <hi>and</hi> Gentilis? We desire him to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the Reasons in our own Books against the <hi>Trinity</hi> of the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theists.</hi> But to these he says not a word, but only falls upon Mr. TO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND'S Book; <hi>in which, or for which we are not in the least concern'd.</hi> Nor do I think the Learned and Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Author will hold himself to be interested to defend that <hi>Christianity not Mysterious</hi> with which his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship presents us.</q>
So far that cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated <hi>Vnitarian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>good Temper</hi> and <hi>sound Iudgment</hi> usually go together, and if the absence of the former be no Demonstration that the latter is also wanting, yet questionless it creates a very reasonable suspicion of it; for a bad Cause is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally supported by Violence and ill
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:63904:23"/>
Arts, while TRUTH establishes it self only by Lenity and Perswasion. This is so certain that when an undis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Person happens to be engag'd on the right side, and employs Force or Calumny in its defence, we always find he does it infinitely more harm than good. That such as receive Gain or Honour by any thing should op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose those who go about to destroy it, tho with design to introduce a better in the room of it, is no great wonder tho it be manifestly unjust. Thus the Silversmiths of <hi>Ephesus</hi> headed by DEMETRIUS rais'd a mighty Tumult against the Apostle PAUL for ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Trade, which was solely maintain'd by Lies and Impostures at the expence of the Peoples Credulity. The <hi>Primitive Christians</hi> were repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented by the <hi>Heathen Priests</hi> as Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istical, Rebellious, Incestuous, and in a word, polluted with all manner of Wickedness and Impiety; by which nefarious Artifices they procur'd those innocent Persons to be cruelly persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Infamy, Confiscation, and Death it self in all its shapes. The <hi>Waldenses, Wicclifists, Hussites,</hi> and the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:63904:23"/>
first <hi>Reformers</hi> were treated after the same manner by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; and when they could not seize their Persons, they never fail'd to load 'em with horrid, black, and monstrous Aspersions, that they might not be wanting to prejudice 'em all manner of ways, as if this had been the very Method prescrib'd in the <hi>Gospel</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Erroneous. Thus we read such accounts of LUTHER and CAL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIN'S Lives publish'd by the <hi>Monks</hi> of those Times, as paint 'em worse than Devils, and that make their Doctrine as different from what we know it to be, as the Historians were from telling Truth.</p>
            <p>I am sorry to observe among us any Remains of that implacable and bitter Spirit, tho such as distinguish themselves by their eminent Vertues retain no tincture of so mean and base a Disposition. The Character which that most excellent Person the late <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> has left on Record of the <hi>Socinians</hi> (when he was stre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuously arguing against their Opinions) ought to be a Model which no body should be asham'd to imitate. He
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:63904:24"/>
did not think to lessen his own Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or to hurt his Cause, when he frankly acknowledg'd them <hi>to be a Pattern of the fair way of disputing,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Four Serm. against the Socin.</hi> p. 57, 58.</note> 
               <hi>and debating matters of Religion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Heat and unseemly Reflections upon their Adversaries. They generally argue matters with that Temper and Gravity,</hi> says he, <hi>and with that freedom from Passion and Transport which becomes a serious and weighty Argument: and for the most part they reason closely and clearly, with extraordinary guard and caution, with great dexterity and decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and yet with smartness and subtlety enough, with a very gentle heat and few hard words: Vertues to be prais'd whereever they are found, yea even in an Enemy, and very worthy our Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Yet this great Man, who so candidly represents his Adversaries, was himself most scurrilously and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily handl'd by his own and the Enemies of the Government. And here I must do Justice to Dr. PAYNE lately deceas'd, who, as he tells the World in his Letter to the Bishop of <hi>Rochester,</hi> was desir'd by his Grace the present <hi>Arch-bishop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:63904:24"/>
answer Mr. TOLAND; and why should not every body that thinks him in the wrong take the same liberty of writing against him, as he did to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish his Thoughts before? Now if Mr. TOLAND'S own Judgment ought to be receiv'd in this case, the Doctor has in his two Sermons said more against him than the Bishop of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi> Mr. NORRIS, the Anonymous <hi>Oxonian,</hi> the Author of the Occasional Paper, Mr. BEVERLY, Mr. GAIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HARD, Mr. BROWNE, or any other Answerer; and yet instead of treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him like a <hi>Dominican Inquisitor,</hi> he uses, with some little warmth, such Grave and Christian Language as shews his Metropolitan's Judgment and Moderation in pitching upon him, as well as his own Skill and Sincerity in the management of his Trust.</p>

Morals of Christianity, while we are over earnestly disputing for the Faith of it; or perhaps <hi>only for some false and mistaken, or at least some useless Opinions, and over-nice and subtle Controversies about it.</hi> This has been the fault of those who have contended more for Victory than Truth, and more for their own Credit and Vain-glory than the Christian Faith; who tho they may be in the right, as 'tis ten to one that they are not (<hi>for Truth seldom dwells with such a Spirit of Rage, and Pride, and Passion, but rather with a quite other Temper</hi>) yet they great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly disserve the Cause they so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duly manage. And as they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver like to convince their Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, so they give others just ground to suspect that <hi>they supply want of better Reason and stronger Arguments with weak and impotent Calumny, with undecent and unbecoming Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections.</hi> This is as Criminal and as Unchristian as the <hi>Error</hi> or the <hi>Heresy</hi> they are so zealous against; and 'tis to be doubted <hi>'tis rather a false Fire and a hypocritical Zeal, not
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:63904:25"/>
for the Cause of God so much as their own</hi>; and that <hi>this is kindl'd not from the Altar, but some other place, and blown up by some private</hi> PIQUE <hi>and sinister Designs,</hi> that thus blazes out to such an outrageous degree as to consume and destroy, not only <hi>its Adversaries</hi> if it were in its power, but even the most vital and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial Parts of Christianity, even <hi>Peace, Love,</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi>; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends for the <hi>Christian Faith</hi> with such a most <hi>Diabolical</hi> and <hi>Vnchristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Temper.</hi> This is very far from the Spirit of Christ and Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and however precious the Faith be, yet the Apostle tells us, <hi>if we had all Faith, and understood all Mys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, and all Knowledg, yet without Charity we are nothing,</hi> however great we may be in our own Thoughts.

Happiness of the <hi>Society</hi> by his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, Learning, Industry, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: And who, in a word, are not willing to deprive themselves of real and certain <hi>Advantages</hi> for the sake of uncertain, contested, or useless <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations</hi>; as if one that wants it should reject the profer'd Service of an honest and able Accountant, because he believes not a World in the Moon; or not allow an Ingenious Man's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation to be agreeable, for ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culing the Fable of St. PATRICK'S Purgatory.

'Tis like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise clear as the Sun they were Mr. TOLAND'S Enemies that made, or continue all the needless stir about his Book, and not his Friends, who
