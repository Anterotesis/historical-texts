            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For (to say the truth) the Regiments that should have seconded <hi>Vrrey,</hi> not doing their parts so well as they ought, forced his partee to make somewhat a disorderly retreat, and the Prince to send hasty succours to them, which the Queenes Regiment (commanded by my Lord <hi>Iermyn</hi>) was ordered to doe, which his Lordship performed with much Gallantry, being received very steadily, by a strong body of the Enemies Horse, and with a Composednesse in the Officer that commanded them very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably. For his Lordship advancing before his Regiment, with the Marquesse <hi>de la Vieuville</hi> on the one hand, and the Lord <hi>Digby</hi> on the other (the Enemies Volley of Carabines given them smartly at lesse than 10 yards) being past, the Commander somewhat for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder than the rest, was plainely seene to prye into their countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and removing his leavell from one to another to discharge his Pistoll as it were by Election at the Lord <hi>Digbyes</hi> head, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any more hurt, (saving onely the burning of his face) than hee himselfe received by my Lord <hi>Iermyn's</hi> sword, who (upon the Lord <hi>Digbyes</hi> Pistoll missing fire) ran him with it in to the back, but he was as much beholding to his Armes there, as the L. <hi>Digby</hi> to his head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peece. Immediately upon this shocke, the Queens Regiment was so charged in the Reare by a fresh body of theirs, that the greatest part of it, shifting for themselves, the Lord <hi>Iermyn,</hi> accompanied with the French Marquesse, and the Officers onely of his Regiment, thought it as safe a way as well as the most honourable, to venture forwards through their whole Army, rather than to charge back through those that had invironed him, and so with admirable successe (the unhappy losse of that gallant Marquesse excepted) he brought 4 Colours and all his Officers off safe, having made their way round, through the grosse of the enemies Foot. The L. <hi>Digby</hi> being stonn'd, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Regiment of the Enemies by a brave Charge, which Prince <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert</hi> in person made upon them with his owne Troop, wherein his Highnesse horse was shot in the head under him, but yet by Gods blessing brought him off; and so the Enemies horse being beaten up quite to their Foot, and Cannon, the night comming upon us, gave a period to that action. That night we quarterd in the field some 2. miles distant from the Enemy, who by the next morning was stolen away as far as <hi>Hungerford;</hi> whereupon, the Prince conjecturrng rightly the course they would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

The Rebels thus happily overtaken in their flight, consultation was held of the way to prevent their farther evading us, and it was resolved on for the best, to draw all the Kings Army that night into a large field on the other side of <hi>Newbury,</hi> adjoyning to those closes where the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy had made this haul, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
