            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Here the moſt earneſt hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſhall be adequately ſatiated, and the moſt ſtupid inappetency (unleſs it be volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily habitual and perverſly obſtinate) may be awakened to an earneſt ſearch of that Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue by the genuine repreſentation of its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable value and raviſhing beauty; and the eaſie, plain and ſure means of attaining it here held forth: But being a little may be by farr too much in the ordinary (yea, I had almoſt ſaid univerſal) way of talking much like a Perroquet of Virture, without any living ſence of it in the ſpirit, its beſt not to divert the <hi>Reader</hi> from that Fountain where it flows living; I mean, that Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker who can truely in a moſt ample ſence ſay with David, <hi>Credidi propter quod &amp; lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quutus ſum</hi>; I believed, and therefore I have ſpoken: and with the maſter of Virtue, <hi>Verba quae loquor non mea ſunt ſed patris qui me miſit</hi>; the words which I ſpeak are not mine, but the Fathers which hath ſent me.</p>
            <p>Only this being likely the firſt that hath appeared in our Language of the Writings of

that extraordinary Organ of God's Spirit, ANTONIA BOURIGNON, it may be both ſuitable and acceptable to give the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Searcher of ſolid Truth ſome entry into the unparalelled greatneſs of the thing, by a brief recital of ſome memorable things of that perſon, and of the thoughts of ſome few of them, whoſe Souls that ſame Spirit touched by that Perſon and her Doctrine, who was the Spring and Life of both.</p>

                  <p>I Have long ago reſolved for my ſelf to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to gain my living by the moſt abject and contemptible Works and Employs in the World; and I have reaſon to lay my acount ſo; for certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if I preached in a Church where there were perſons, how ever little more knowing, or of more worldly power than here; I would never be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, only becauſe I manifeſt the deceipts that reign in Religion and in Sects.</p>
                  <p>I moſt willingly leave that precious Soul Mrs. <hi>Bourignon</hi> to ſleep and reſt in Jeſus Chriſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I dare not nor will not pray you to ſalute her in my Name; I pray God only ratifie the Saluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:65025:3"/>
and divine Benediction that you tell me ſhe wiſhes to me—</p>
                  <p>— I marvel not at what you write of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God which is in Mrs. <hi>Bourignon,</hi> that they who are with you will judge and think and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal with the ſpirit of Zelots, ſeeing I find no true Knowledge of God, nor of his ſon, nor of the Holy Spirit in men. Seeing God ſhews the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Grace to you and to me, to ſee and feel that the Spirit of God is in her.
<q>(— pauci quos aequus amavit, Jupiter —)</q>
God give alſo Grace, that it may be for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Glory of his Name, and to our Souls Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Though before I ſaid I durſt not nor would not have you to ſalute that <hi>Child of God</hi> Mrs. <hi>Bourignon</hi> from me, yet do it if you can conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently; I deſire earneſtly to ſee Mrs. <hi>Bourignon</hi> while ſhe is yet alive; for men are not worthy that ſhe ſhould be ſo long.</p>
                  <p>I know not what to make of the miniſtry: I have long deplored the imprudence I had when I engaged in it.</p>

                  <p>IT is now three years ſince Mr. <hi>P.</hi> began to addreſs your Writings to me. I had no ſooner

ſeen or read them, but I judged you were of God. I received the Truths of them the rather, becauſe God had already told me ſeveral like or near unto them. Since that time I have been fully perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in my interiour, and am ſo dayly more, that you are wholly filled with the Holy Spirit: and nothing is capable to make me believe the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, although I were the only perſon in the world of that mind: And I think not ſtrange that you are wholy filled with it, ſeeing you have employed ſo many years to attain it: I mean, that you prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe Holineſs, and have given your ſelf to the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying of your ſoul, and the other things that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it from God.</p>
                  <p>I ſee, you poſſeſs alone all the Truths whereof all the other Sects and Religions of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> have only a part; and that you have them in your Soul, and in your Books, without any mixture of error: whereas on the contrary, I ſee no Sect that hath not more or leſs of Errors, as their Authors did more or leſs come near to God internally. You alone diſcover fully the falſe Piety, wherein the devout of this World are deceived.</p>
                  <p>As I do firmly believe then, that being filled with God, he wills that you be a Chanel and Conduit, through which he will flow into the Souls of them that are diſpoſed and fitted to receive him: I deſire that he may flow from you into me, and that being in me, he put there the fruits of his Spirit —</p>

            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <p>— Yet Mr. <hi>P.</hi> my Friend, among other things he wrote to me from you, having ſaluted me in your name two different times: I deſired and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that theſe ſalutations might be ratified by God; and thereupon I have reſolved to repreſent unto you ſomething for the good of my ſoul. Which I do moſt humbly and before God. I ſee alſo, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good Souls from divers places deſire to become yet better, ſome by your Letters, and the reſt by coming as near unto your Perſon as they can; and that you have the Charity to ſtretch forth your arms unto all of them. I hope alſo you will hold them forth to me the more willingly, becauſe I am af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with the ſenſe of my ſins, and for my not having Love enough to my God, and that there be yet many things to be amended in me, if I may bear the Image of God or of Jeſus, as I deſire. I ought the rather to do ſo, even with great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction and Sbame, that God hath repleniſhed my ſpirit with ſeveral moſt rare Graces and unknown Lights; which will render me ſo much the more damnable before him, if he have not Mercy on me.</p>
                  <p>I own, that all the knowledges which God hath
<pb facs="tcp:65025:4"/>
for ſo many years, and does continue dayly to pour into my Soul, as that of the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> of the converſion of <hi>Jews</hi> and Pagans, of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> of Satan reigning in all States and Conditions, Sects and Religions under the name of Chriſt, the vanity of human litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or that which they call <hi>Theologie,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtudying, or compoſing Books; which I ſee by the Light of Faith to be meer deluſions of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and ſo many other ſecrets which God ſpeaks often in the ear of my Soul; are all nothing in reſpect of the holineſs it muſt be filled with, that it may ſee God. And that if it have not the laſt, though it did divinely poſſeſs all theſe others, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan might well entertain it therein, and even teach it more, provided he might keep it always cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive under one or more ſins.</p>
                  <p>It was upon that very foundation that I did paſſionatly love and ſtudy human Literature, in which Satan would willingly have nouriſhed me, and entertained my ſpirit all my life, in detaining me thereby from the ſearch and from the true a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration of God in the Soul. So I was already in the profeſſion of the Miniſtry, even for ſome years, that I had not any true knowledge of God, and moſt ignorant of true Religion. Theſe things could get no entry into my <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, finding it ſo full of prejudices in favour of the reformed religion, and againſt all other Sects, as alſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to Books and worldly Sciences. This is it that
<pb facs="tcp:65025:5"/>
made me leave the <hi>Romiſh Church,</hi> in which I was born, and lived to the age of <hi>22.</hi> or <hi>23.</hi> years, apprehending that I ſhould periſh if I died in it, believing alſo that the <hi>Reformed Church</hi> was altogether holy, I was abuſed or impoſed on therein. From one <hi>Babylon</hi> which I left I'm come into another. If I were yet in that of my Nativity, I would no more leave it, but with my Soul and Spirit, and would ſanctifie my ſelf there as well as in ſo many other Sects, which I perceive now to be all but works or Idols of mens hands. So many Pantings, Prayers, Studies and other things which I have employed to attain to the quality of Miniſter, I had employed them to the ſanctifying of my ſoul. Alſo I know that the charge of Paſtor, which I have exerciſed more than theſe ten years, is a charge meerly po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litique and human, and that has nothing Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nor of God, but vain in the perſons exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing it, and in them that yield themſelves the ſubjects of it. And although for ſome years I have preached Truths unknown unto me, and alſo which men cannot nor will not know, to wit, that God is a Spirit, and that he is to be worſhipped as ſuch: Yet I find it is a ſubtil Deceit to pretend to ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie men without being holy our ſelves, and that theſe good wills do not always come from the holy Spirit: hence I am perſwaded, that as long as Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are not holy, God will not work any thing by them: and that I do firmly believe, that God hath at
<pb facs="tcp:65025:5"/>
preſent in his Anger curſed the Miniſters and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of the <hi>Reformed Churches.</hi> I ſay farther, that it is impoſſible for a good man to exerciſe it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God without partaking with mens ſins.</p>
                  <p>This is one of the reaſons that oblige me to write to you; and becauſe I believe you give no counſel but after God's mind, I deſire your advice herein, and wiſh God give me Grace to follow it: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Miniſtry being both in me and in others, ſuch as I have juſt now deſcribed it, if I ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in it, or not: that is, I deſire to know by you what is Gods will concerning me; many reaſons oblige me to leave it off; and I cannot tell what other points of conſcience do yet retain me in it. If it were God's will that I ſhould forſake it, it would be in the deſire of coming as near unto you as I could, eſpecially if I were aſſured to be in the leaſt uſefull to aid you as much in the glorifying of God (I mean in carrying that <hi>new and everlaſting Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi> unto the World,) as I ſhould hope you would be unto me for my ſouls welfare.</p>
                  <p>Another reaſon obliging me to write to you is, that notwithſtanding ſo many Graces that God hath put into my Soul, yet I am not ſatisfied in my Conſcience: I am yet wrathful, and am carnal in Marriage. Theſe two ſins have very ſore and often afflicted my Soul; even I dare not promiſe unto God that I will not commit them any more: for I have promiſed too often to him, and have fallen therein too too often again. My Soul has been in great ſorrow for it, and has learnt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
<pb facs="tcp:65025:6"/>
to put it ſelf below all groſs ſinners; alſo God would ſo humble me thereby, that I never reprove ſin or ſinners, nor ever ſpeak of them, but I fall into greater my ſelf. It is in this and in other things that you ſhall judge proper, that I deſire you would give me ſome rules to lead my Life after God, in the things of God, and in the things of the World: would to God it may be to my Salvation.</p>
                  <p>But there is enough ſaid and asked for the firſt time: I am in the bottom of my Soul, and deſire to be yet more,</p>

                     <p>AFter by your counſel and recommendation I began to read Mrs. <hi>Antonia Bourignons</hi> Writings, I felt as it were a fighting againſt them, and they ſeemed to me not to deſerve ſo much praiſe; yet conſidering that your eſteem muſt depend on a well-grounded knowledge, becauſe you knew the Gentle-woman, you converſed with her, and have accurately examined her writings: Hence I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to read more attentively: whence immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a ſublim wiſdom laying open man's interiour diſplayed it ſelf. The numerous difficulties that occurred in the beginning, do evaniſh as my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is with more attention. Yet I cannot as yet aſſent unto all, perhaps becauſe I have read only few of them, and have put fewer of them into practiſe, without which theſe vritings ſeem not underſtandable, as alſo the intelligence of Holy Scripture, is promiſed only to them who obey the will of God.

Our corrupt Nature lays many obſtacles in the way, and the ſeducing world ſtrengthens it: eſpecially in the Art to which I have (perhaps without God's conduct) addicted my ſelf, in which a thouſand diſtractions do dayly occur, an Act ſo uncertain, and ſo filled with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts, that I doubt if it may be exerciſed with a ſafe Conſcience, before I would demonſtrate and amend its Errors; but I know not the ſource of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, Sin.

As her Spirit and Tongue began to be looſed from the Sleep and ſilence of Infancy, the firſt Expreſſion ſhe was capable to give of what impreſſion her Soul received, was a grain of admirable and divine Wiſdom, which fructified unto everlaſting Life. At the age of four years, her Parents ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving inſtructed her piouſly in the Goſpel and Life of Jeſus Chriſt, ſhe asked ſtill, <hi>Where are the Chriſtians? Let us go to the place where Chriſtians live: Where are they whom Jeſus Chriſt taught? Take me to them that live as Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> O moſt profound and divine! They in their worldly Wiſdom would undeceive her, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that there in <hi>Flanders</hi> they were <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and followed Chriſt. She ſaid, <hi>That could not be; for Chriſt commended Poverty, they were altogether for Riches; Chriſt deſpiſed honours, and Pleaſures, chooſing meanneſs and trouble: but they were earneſt for what he rejected, and ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his choice, (that they lived no ways like Chriſt</hi>) O Great God! <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Pſ. 8.</note>

diſcerning a worldly Life from a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and far beyond the old Philoſophy Studied procedure, ſeeking a man among men, moſt natively tattling out, where are the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> amidſt <hi>Chriſtians</hi>? men fight and diſpute, and write and preach, and what not, who ſhall have the beſt Religion, and Chriſtianity moſt pure and flouriſhing: Lo God will bring them to agreement; and how he ſets a Girle of four years old amidſt them, and puts in her little Mouth theſe ſtammering words, <hi>where are the Chriſtians?

               <p>It is true in the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that <hi>God will perfect his Praiſe out of the mouth of Babes:</hi> but in the World we muſt expect the Truth and Praiſe of God from a mouth that can ſpeak <hi>Latin,</hi> or even <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Hebrew;</hi> and for the more aſſurance, there muſt be a great many of theſe wiſe Heads aſſembled to make a Synod or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, not to ſleight our Theological Docto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities

and Maſterſhips by giving heed to this babe. So they laughed her iterated and earneſt Demands to ſilence; yet neither that nor the ruder treatment ſhe met with, as it encreaſed, were ſo far from extinguiſhing that divine ſpark God had kindled in her, that they ſerved ſtill to encreaſe its flame: for this firſt repulſe made her turn more in to God in her own heart, detecting the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of worldly things, ſhe ſought of him the Grace to live as <hi>Chriſtians</hi> did, and even then every thing was to her occaſion of tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to him with different prayers, ſuitable to him who was her only Councellour and Companion, until her ſiſter, much addicted to the Vanities of the World, would needs have her follow, ſhe ſaid to every body, ſhe had no ſpirit to converſe and accommodate her ſelf to others; and by that artifice the Devil prevailed ſo far as to make her follow the company and mode of the Youth of the World, only to pleaſe them, to ſhew that ſhe had ſpirit enough to appear brisk; in which ſhe ſucceeded ſo well, or rather ſo ill, that quickly ſhe obſcured her ſiſter, gaining the favour and goodliking of all, and pleaſing her Parents extreamly, being of a meek, humble, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fable and jovial Humour, and a good Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that her Father employed her in his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, which ſhe managed with a great deal
<pb facs="tcp:65025:11"/>
of dexterity and induſtrie. But all this coſt her the loſs of that communion ſhe had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly with God, as familiar as one Child with another.</p>
               <p>Yet God had pity on that poor Creature wandring from him, he gave her often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward invitations, even amidſt her divertiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and <hi>will you then leave me for another? ſhall you find a Lover more perfect and faithful than I am?</hi> This pierced her heart ſo as to make her flow into Tears; but upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſhe would charm her ſerious thoughts, and the habit of Vanity, and Tentations got the aſcendant on her: at length God ſent more aſſiſtance to his call, by filling her ſpirit with the terrible thoughts of Death, Judgment and Eternity. Sometimes ſhe would regret, rent her cloaths, and deteſting her vanity, throw away all her Ornaments of Folly; again ſhe would yield to the tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of company and Divertiſments. In theſe conflicts God fortified her, ſhe became pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with ſo great fear of the Judgment of God, that ſhe durſt not ſhut her eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of her ſins, which ſhe thought were ſo great that no body ever had committed the like; not that ſhe had done any evil or unhoneſt thing after the world, whoſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty is conſiſtent with turning away from God, and going to all the Devils provided
<pb facs="tcp:65025:11"/>
regularly and in form with approbation and priviledge: but becauſe ſhe had left her ſweet Entertainments with God for world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Divertiſments, after ſhe had received ſo many Graces from him, ſhe ſaw that ſo great a ſin that Hell and all the pains of Hell were not ſufficient to puniſh her ingratitude. God ſeeing her correſpond to the tracts of his divine Mercy, redoubled them on her, that ſhe was ſwallowed up of contrition, paſſing the whole nights on her knees, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the bottom of her Soul, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? Ah! Lord, what ſhall I do that I may be acceptable to thee? My God, my God! where art thou? what ſhall I do that I may find thee again?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After ſhe had taſted long and deep of that bitter deſolation, wherein the ſoul finds it ſelf as abandoned and rejected of God, which they that have taſted call <hi>the Pains and Sorrows of Hell,</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and other Saints, God began to heal: The firſt return ſhe had of God into her Soul was (in anſwer to that continual Prayer, <hi>Lord what wilt thou have me to do?</hi>) the whole of the Goſpel, theſe words, <hi>Forſake all earthly things; ſeparate your ſelf from the affection of the Creatures; renounce and deny your ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Her Viciſſitudes of Deſolation and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation ſucceeded until God purified her
<pb facs="tcp:65025:12"/>
from all task or ſtain of her vain converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and uſually theſe inward piercing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions were preparatives to ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Graces or favours of God.</p>
               <p>And it is incredible what floods of Tears and of Contrition it coſt her before ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered her former Familiarity with God, and her no leſs incredible ſtrict ſevere Auſterity in a mortifying Life, which ſhe continued many years by a principle of juſtice, and its firſt mover was the love of God: until God appointed her to return to an ordinary way of living, while God's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary divine communications to her flowed more and more, during all her life, like a ſtream, ſtill encreaſed until its ending a mighty River into the vaſt Ocean, which in the ſame degree encreaſed in her ſoul that Conſtancy, divine Love and all Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and Graces as not moved were more eſtabliſhed by all the aſſaults which the craft and malice of Hell did eagerly ſpue out all her life while ſhe purſued her firſt ſearch of <hi>True Chriſtians</hi>: which when ſhe could not find any true knowledge of a Chriſtian Life and ſelf-ſeeking among all the devout and Religious Perſons, whoſe earthly-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs ſhe eaſily diſcovered through all their fair Pretexts, ſhe turned the more in to God in her Heart, where he trained her in the
<pb facs="tcp:65025:12"/>
true <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and told her, <hi>She muſt not ſeek it in the World, but in her own heart with God, and in Solitude</hi>; whereupon ſhe did over the belly of all Oppoſition, Tentations, Allurements of Friends, Riches, and all worldly advantages, moſt generouſly and conſtantly forſake all, ſeeking that beloved ſolitude where ſhe might enjoy God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſturbance. God gave her a Spiritual ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, retiring her Heart and Soul from all that was not himſelf, yet retained her from other to make her a Light to lead other good Souls out of the <hi>Egypt</hi> of this World, into the ſame Wilderneſs of heavenly-mindedneſs. The traverſes ſhe met with, her conſtant Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, and all the ſteps of her conduct ſo ſignally diſpoſed by the immediate hand and Councel of God, as its unaccountable and vaſt, ſo it is beyond the bounds and deſign of this ſhort preliminary to inſiſt on; who deſire a more ſatisfying Account, may be ſatisfied by the <hi>Hiſtory of her Life,</hi> written part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by her ſelf, partly by a faithful and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious eye and ear Witneſs.</p>
               <p>Her deſire was to be unknown and unno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed; yet many perſons of good-will of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſorts came to her acquaintance, who owed and owned unto her (as the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Gods Spirit) their Converſion, their Enlightening, their Inflaming in divine
<pb facs="tcp:65025:13"/>
Love, their Comforting and Strengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and their Eternal Life; teſtifying, as they were living and ſtanding Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, that her Words, her Writings, her Works, and all her Life had an unuttera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble divine efficacy and power of converting and ſaving Souls that were well diſpoſed, infinitly beyond all the enervate and lifeleſs Means and Ordinances in the hands of the moſt elaborate and erudite heads, exerciſing that trade for their dayly bread, without the ſpirit of it; under which, alas! its too vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and by all that have but the leaſt ſpark of ingenuity confeſt, and of ſincerity regre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that we live moſt part ſo little or not at all moved from our earthly biaſs of ſelf, which declines us ſo much to Hell, that if we get but a little ſurvey of the Earth, we never attain, nor it may be ſeek, any true glimpſe of heavenly things: which gives us to notice the ſame proportion of illuminating, enlivening and invigorating force of painted Preachings to real ones, as there is of the ſun painted on a board to that in the Firmament.</p>
               <p>Several who with good applauſe had long exerciſed the function of conducting and directing Souls, as Miniſters and Fathers in the Church, not of the leaſt erudition, but of the moſt uprightneſs, made it their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to learn at this illiterate Maid the emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

Vanity of their former fruitleſs Labours, and to begin again from the A, B, C, of Solid Virtue, under her direction, owning more Solid Light and Divine Life from ſome few Rays of her Spirit, than from all their Schools and Books, Studies and Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings.</p>
               <p>Notice only one notable Matter in the way; In an Hoſpital of poor Girles ſhe charitably governed, ſhe diſcovered them all to be Witches in expreſs compact with the Devil, and that a vaſtly ſurpriſing greater part of the world than is uſually by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent thought, are ſuch, by evidences ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying and convictive to the moſt doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that will not be obſtinate.</p>
               <p>Paſſing from her firſt appearance in the World to her firſt publique appearance to the World.</p>
               <p>On the ſecond of December 1667. ſhe departed from <hi>Mechline</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and came to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> with deſign to ſatisfie the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitation of her friends, and God's will of having the Truth promulgate and known by the printing her Writings, entituled, <hi>The Light of the World</hi>; and at the convenient ſeaſon of ſailing to go for Holſtein, where in the Iſle of <hi>Nordſtrand</hi> ſhe had bought a Farm from Mr. <hi>de Cort,</hi> the Director of the ſaid Iſle, and Proprietor of moſt of it, who was going
<pb facs="tcp:65025:14"/>
with her. In honour and imitation of the obſcure mean Life of Jeſus Chriſt, that ſhe might be unknown, ſhe hired a little Houſe by the ſhore, in a very retired place; but falling ſoon into a ſore and dangerous ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſhe was obliged to yield to Mr. <hi>de Corts</hi> bringing a phyſitian of his acquaintance, who with another he had told of her, coming to know her, could not abſtain from telling others, that quickly her fame was through all the Country; and one of her Letters to the Dean of <hi>Lille,</hi> which is the 5<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> 
                  <hi>Letter in the ſecond part of Light ariſen in Darkneſs,</hi> and is the firſt of all her Works that was prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, coming out in the beginning of the year 1668. made her ſo famous, that every one was earneſt to ſee her, and converſe with her.</p>
               <p>She ſeeing it God's will to manifeſt her, reſolved to give free entry and audience to all that pleaſed. She was then viſited for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a year and a half from all places by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of all ſorts of Profeſſions, Religions and Opinions, by Theologues, Phyloſophe's, Rabbins, imaginary Prophets, and all the moſt curious and expert in all Arts and Sciences. Almoſt all did eaſily diſcover in her the divine Light whereby God would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive his love in their Souls, with moſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and convincing Touches and Motions
<pb facs="tcp:65025:14"/>
of his ſpirit; but they could not come to the Marriage of the Lamb for their Farms, their Merchandiſes, their Offices and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, their Wives and Children; and the Love of the World and the things of the World were in them, and ſtiffled the Love of the Father, and all the Proteſtations they had made to follow Chriſt, forſaking all for him, excepting two or three, who forſook all, and followed the Truth of God in her to death.</p>
               <p>Of the many memorable things paſſed in theſe Viſits, you ſhall be diverted but with two or three.</p>
               <p>Before ſhe had any Acquaintance or Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits there, Mr. <hi>de Cort</hi> told her, that the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſts</hi> were good and pious men, having a great eſteem of the Graces which God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on her; and that they proteſted, if they might come to her, it ſhould be in Humility, as little Children, ſubmitting to the Light of God: She anſwered prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That is not true, theſe are great men, who will hardly ſubmit themſelves to the truth, and become little Children; God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing their diſpoſition to her better than themſelves knew it. And they ſhewed at firſt to be touched; but no ſooner did ſhe, without deſigning any perſon, diſcover the nature and properties of Hypocriſie, and the
<pb facs="tcp:65025:15"/>
general corruption even in the moſt devout and holy, but they finding themſelves pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, roſe all up againſt her by the artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces deſcried in the Letters ſhe wrote then in the 3. part of <hi>Light ariſen in Darkneſs,</hi> and 2. and 3. Part of the <hi>Funeral of Falſe Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie.</hi> Mrs. B. in one of her Letters to them, having written (not conſidering) when ſhe ſought after them, <hi>that there were no more true Chriſtians, and God told her ſhe ſhould be the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of true believers.</hi> Leſt that eſpecially that <hi>mother of true believers</hi> ſhould ſtumble theſe erudide heads, ſhe would ſcore it out; but God ſaid to her, <hi>what's written, let it ſtay written:</hi> and indeed no ſooner had they that in their hands, but they made ſuch a dirty hubub, her Pride, her Pride, that though her after-wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings ſatisfie any that have common ſenſe on that head, theſe men have not yet come to themſelves.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Serrarius</hi> famous enough for his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondencies and his Writings, was of the firſt that knew and recommended her every where; he would lead her every where as a living Goſpel, that ſhould enlighten all the world; he would cauſe print all her Writings, and even of his Titles and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces to them yet extant: but ſeeing at length that ſhe would not ſwerve from the pure Truth God revealed in her, to ſecond his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb facs="tcp:65025:15"/>
Opinions of the reſtoring a <hi>Levitical</hi> Worſhip of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and his eſteem of a certain Seducer at that time ariſen in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtine,</hi> he rejected her for his own Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Comenius,</hi> ſo famous among the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, his Learning not having puft him up, as it does ordinarily, fell out with Mr. <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarius</hi> becauſe of his injuſtice againſt Mrs. <hi>Bourignon,</hi> and retained a Veneration for her all the reſt of his Life, and on his Death-Bed deſired a laſt viſit of her: ſaying, <hi>O That Holy Maid! where is ſhe then? may I be ſo happy as to ſee her yet once before I die? all the Knowledge and Sciences I have attained, are but productions of reaſon and of Human Spirit and Study; but ſhe has a Wiſdom and Light that come only from God immediatly by the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> After ſhe had ſeen him, and was gone, he ſaid of her with tranſports of joy to them that viſited him, <hi>I have ſeen an Angel of God! God has ſent me his Angel to day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God did alſo let her ſee how far the beſt cultivated human ſpirit is blind, and far from the Kingdom of God, by conferences ſhe had with ſome <hi>Carteſians,</hi> both Divines and meer Phyloſophers: ſhe had a diſcourſe with the Profeſſors <hi>Heydan</hi> and <hi>Burmannus</hi>; but <hi>Nicodemus</hi> was too great a Doctor, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand Chriſts Language or learn of him;
<pb facs="tcp:65025:16"/>
though ſo blind as to deny that the Spirit blows where he liſts at preſent, and his Voice to be heard, to infer that we muſt not abandon our Veſſel to the conduct of his divine Inſpirations, but ſteer by human ſpirit and reaſon. She wrote to him on that occaſion <hi>Letter</hi> 12. <hi>of the firſt part of the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of falſe Theologie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Phyloſophers would perſwade her that ſhe came near to their Principles, but God ſhewed her their Nullity and errour. She told them their diſeaſe, that they would comprehend all by the activity of human Reaſon, and not give place to the Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of divine Faith, which requires a ceſſation of our Reaſon and Spirit, that God may diſplay that divine Light, which gives the only true Knowledge of God; but the mean paſs that Reaſon with all its equipage of Ideas and clear and diſtinct Conceptions will be at to defend or regulate it ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God at Death felt a <hi>Carteſian</hi> gentleman even in this life, who in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found ſtupid ſecurity they are all leavened with after their once doubting to the full, Scorned Mrs. <hi>Bourignons</hi> admonitions, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, laughing; <hi>You call your ſelf the Mother of believers by the Truths you ſay you perſwade and make them believe; and I who have clear and evident demonſtrations, by which I can perſwade</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:65025:16"/>
                  <hi>reaſonable ſpirits, and make them believe much better; I ſhall be the Father of believers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this poor <hi>Father of believers,</hi> who was otherwiſe a man of ſpirit of a good benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent nature, and a perſon of quality, being a little after in a deadly Diſeaſe, in the flower of his age, God opened his eyes to ſee his poor ſtate, and lament his error; he began to cry with Tears night and day, <hi>O my underſtanding! my underſtanding! where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to haſt thou brought me! Alas! my Reaſon I relied ſo much on, what aſſiſtance canſt thou give me now? Thou canſt not now give me Salvation, nor the hope of it! I muſt be damned, there can be no mercy for me.</hi> A friend comforting him the beſt he could, he wholly diſconſolate asked continually, <hi>Think you than there is yet any mercy to be hoped for my Soul?</hi> and then looking and toſſing about cryed again, <hi>My underſtanding! my underſtanding! alaſs! where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to haſt thou led me</hi>! Then to the firſt Friend, <hi>Go tell deſire that good ſoul</hi> (Mrs Bourignon) <hi>to pray to God for me; that I may obtain pardon of that ſin: for otherwiſe I am damned; or I muſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a flul long Purgatory: O! if I could recover from this Diſeaſe, I would turn wholly to God, and would follow altogether another way:</hi> but when he told Mrs. <hi>Bourignon</hi> of it, ſhe anſwered: <hi>he ſhall not recover, but he ſhall die; for if he did recover, he would fall deeper in that pernicious</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:65025:17"/>
                  <hi>Error.</hi> As in effect he did, in a good and ſound Judgment, in great contrition, ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Jeſus Chriſt crucified<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>God having ſhown her experimentally by that frequent converſation, how little hope remains of converting the world, by the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle welcome, and leſs Correſpondence the Truth met with, even with the beſt and wiſeſt of all ſorts; he brought her with the two or three, that, ſeeing the means of purifying their ſouls to the Love of God, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king out their ſalvation, in her company, would ſell all for that Pearl of great Price, maugre the tentation that loſt the young man in the Goſpel; for they had great Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Reputation too: I ſay, he brought them from <hi>Holland</hi> to <hi>Holſatia.</hi> And as from the beginning, God did in all her after courſe unto himſelf, ſerve himſelf of the manifold Malice and Perſecutions of Satan againſt the Truth and Light of God, to confound that blackfiend and all his Helliſh Works of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; his violent Perſecutions to extinguiſh it, ſerved but as wind to kindle it; his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to cut off the Meſſenger of it in one place, ſerved but to carry her further to more places and perſons, as with a general embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, his ſecret Blows God did more ſecretly often forewarn her of in ſpirit; his outward open Violences he often no leſs wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb facs="tcp:65025:17"/>
averted; his calumnies and Accuſations of Hereſie did but bring the Truth to more admirable and dazling Evidence and bring to light more and more divine and ſaving myſteries, which ript up all his helliſh He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies and Myſteries of Iniquity, to the gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his malicious ſpirit, and all the like inſtruments of his fury, while the Bread of Life was aboundantly diſpenſed to hungry ſouls, whom it ſhall nouriſh unto Eternal Life, when all the Wicked ſhall be cut off, and the Meek ſhall inherit the Earth.</p>
               <p>For the more particular Account of her divine Pilgrimage, ſee the <hi>Hiſtory of her Life,</hi> and take here a ſhort Bill of that heavenly chear now diſpenſed in her Writings, that took up the ſpare hours of her many diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions at <hi>Amſterdam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The funerall of falſe Theologie</hi>; in the <hi>firſt</hi> part of which ſhe ſhews the Confuſion, the Ignorance, Corruption, Inſenſibility and foundamental Errors of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and even of Conductors and modern Divines. In the <hi>ſecond,</hi> their Preſumption, Envy, Pride, Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy, and Head ſtrongneſs. In the <hi>third,</hi> that all their Theorie and Practices are no more but Phariſaical, without divine Faith. In the <hi>fourth,</hi> that the Devil has great power over men; over the wicked and even over the beſt, whom by theſe other he turns away
<pb facs="tcp:65025:18"/>
from following God, and engages them to co-operate to the Evil of others, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes them draw back after they have aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned the World. That is a work of ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar efficacy and profit. Scarce did ever man read it without being touched in his ſoul, even the moſt wicked, who became pale, and as ſtruck dead with it.</p>
               <p>Upon occaſion of ſome converſe ſhe had with ſome <hi>Carteſian</hi> Philoſophers, ſhe compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>The Holy Perſpective</hi>; wherein ſhe ſhews, that Men, and particularly <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> have loſt the Light of God, which is true and divine Faith, to be led by corrupt Reaſon, and by a falſe or moſt faint Light they draw from nature, ſo perverſe, brutiſh, carnal, and groſs as it is become by ſin: that this is it that has deſtroyed all <hi>Chriſtian-religion,</hi> and brought it to the Blindneſs and Darkneſs wherein it is immerſed: and that God may reſtore it its firſt ſtate, there is no other way but to <hi>abandon</hi> that falſe Guide of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and to reſign our ſelves to God, that he may himſelf revive in us that divine Light of Faith which we have extinguiſhed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The New Heaven and New Earth:</hi> in which is ſhewn, in what Glory the World and Man were created: how they have miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly faild from it; how they entertain and even encreaſe their Miſery; and by what
<pb facs="tcp:65025:18"/>
means they ought to return into the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition God requires to reſtore them to their firſt Glory, and renew all the world. God ſhowed her in Spirit the Glory and Beauty of the firſt World, not ſupportable by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Eyes. All was bright, tranſparent, ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with Light and unſpeakable Glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God's laſt Mercy:</hi> in which by a reaſon enlightened by Faith, not perverted by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Studies and Prejudices, ſhe leads eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man of good judgment to a conviction of the ſpiritual things which Faith diſcovers, and unto which every man's Reaſon, when conducted by a perſon that is illuminated by Faith, renders ſo convincing Teſtimonies, that they who will yield themſelves to its Touch, are moved and preſſed to ask of God a ſaving and divine Knowledge of them by the Light of Faith.</p>
               <p>With all theſe are intermixed many other divine Lights and profound Myſteries, which God had reſerved to this end of the laſt hour, able to enlighten, to quicken, to inflame to ſtrengthen, to encourage, and to raviſh any that have not renounced all intereſt in heavenly things.</p>
               <p>If any find difficulties in her Writings, conſider, that ſhe having no further human Learning than that having learnt it, ſhe did once read the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> and finding
<pb facs="tcp:65025:19"/>
it the ſame with what God ſpake in her Soul, ſhe cloſed the Book to apply ſeriouſly to the doing of it, ſeeking no more reading, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, conferring or other ſtudy, than that of purifying her ſoul from earthly Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and ſins, in following Jeſus Chriſts Doctrine and Example. She could not ſpeak after the Rules and with the Cautions of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Literature, far leſs by the pedantry of the Schools; it were then moſt cruel inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to judge her by them.</p>
               <p>Again, we muſt not ſuppoſe when ſhe treats of a matter, what ſhe does not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in that place, that ſhe denies it, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire her to treat ſo fully (more than her ſcope there requires) as the Scholaſtiques, who handling a matter at their tour, adduce all they can relating to it.</p>
               <p>In the Third place, to underſtand her Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, as all others divinely inſpired, the Key is a good Will, Humility and Prayer: to a Malign, a Corrupt, Proud, Self-wiſe and Self-powerful Reader no entry in them, no favour from them, but that of Death.</p>
               <p>And the center, end and aim of theſe Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings being the Love of God, by renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing our ſelves, the Creatures and ſin, the Devil, the World and the Fleſh; the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we are from this, the greater diſcord and contradiction between theſe Writings and our
<pb facs="tcp:65025:19"/>
corrupt hearts and blind ſpirits: and if ever we will be reconciled, it muſt be by valuing, loving, eſteeming, and ſubmitting to them, as they are conducive to theſe ends, and the difficulties will all quickly evaniſh: this way the Diſciples of Chriſt, of Prophets and Apoſtles entered into their Maſters Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>

Is it not in the deepeſt and final ſincerity of my heart that I proteſt openly, that the words of eternal life were with incomparable Purity, Evidence, Clearneſs, and Solidity in that Soul which thou didſt ſanctifie, and are yet in her holy Writings? In truth, the way that is there recommended as neceſſary to Salvation, is the only and the true way; there is no danger to <hi>abandon</hi> our ſelves wholly and entirely in it: for it is the very Truth: it is the Truth it ſelf. It is the pure Truth. There is none, Lord, there can be none other in Heaven nor in Earth. There is none other way unto eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life than that which thou haſt put into the Mouth, in the Writings, and in the Life of thy moſt holy hand-maid <hi>Antonia Bourignon.</hi> I praiſe

            <p>There is briefly repreſente the whole ſubject handled in this divine Treatiſe; which is more ſpecially noted at the beginning of each <hi>Letter,</hi> that you may, kind <hi>Reader,</hi> view as in a Table, and beter retain in your memory the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſtructions, therein delivered.

<pb facs="tcp:65025:22"/>
under the Preſs in the <hi>German and Low Dutch Tongues,</hi> were taken away by force and violence, and rent. While I conſider theſe obſcure enemies of the truth that Scripture offers it ſelf to me; that, <hi>Every one that Doth (and will do) evil, hateth the Light; and cometh not to the Light, leſt his deeds be reproved: and this is the Condemnation, that Light is come into the world; and men Love Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs rather than Light, becauſe their Deeds are Evil.</hi> It is far otherwiſe with him <hi>who doth (and will do) the Truth; for he cometh to the Light, that his Deeds may be made manifeſt, becauſe they are wrought in God,</hi> Joh. Ch. 3. I pray the God of Truth, that he graciouſly pleaſe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct and lead you in the way of Truth, that you never refuſe to come to the Light. Farewell.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Cannot abſtain from imparting unto you, theſe twenty four letters; which I have written to one of my particular Friends, where I ſhew him what Solid Virtue is: becauſe it is a matter ſo neceſſary for the preſent time, when we ſee falſe virtue reign, or ſuch as is only apparent to the eyes of men; and while ſo many perſons deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, perſwading themſelves that they have true Virtue; whereas they have nothing but fine Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations. They think themſelves Humble, when they can talk well of Humility; and think they have the Love of God, when they deſire to have it: notwithſtanding they have in effect only the Love of themſelves: and it is but Deceit and Falſhood, when they ſay they have the Love of God. They do not ſo much as know the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of their Nature; ſeeing they think they may follow that corruption without ſinning, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they do no evil reproveable before men, and have a will to do well and love God. Which notwithſtanding is not ſufficient to be ſaved; for good deſires without effect, are nothing before God. They are indeed Foundation ſtones, ſerving to the building of true Virtue: For without good De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires we cannot do good Works. We muſt firſt have the deſire, and after put it in execution; which is wanting to many perſons of a good will; who content themſelves to be of a good will, and hope with that, all ſhall go well; without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering,
<pb facs="tcp:65025:23"/>
that the holy Scripture ſays to all in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, <hi>Depart from evil, and do Good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the Evil is in our corrupt nature, which no perſon ought to ignore: yet few depart from that corruption, and moſt love and follow it. thinking they do well: which is a great abuſe and preſumption of ſpirit; for we cannot do good, except we depart from evil; and he that does not reſiſt that corrupt Nature, and renounce it, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not acquire true Virtue, which few perſons com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend: and thence is it that they have only apparent Virtues, and no real ones.</p>
            <p>Therefore is it that I have reſolved to cauſe print theſe twenty four Letters, which treat of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; that they who aſpire unto it, may ſee the ſtate wherein they are, and alſo if they have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired any degrees of it: or if their Virtues be only imaginary.</p>
            <p>I do not preſent this matter of true Virtue to all in general; ſince many ſhould find it too dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to be obſerved: for ſuch as yet love them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or the things of the earth, cannot have all their mind bent to acquire this Virtue; nor tend to the ſpiritual diligence, which it requires.</p>
            <p>But I ſpeak to the free and generous ſouls, who have abandoned the world to follow Jeſus Chriſt, and ſuch will eaſily underſtand me; for none is better diſpoſed to underſtand me, than he that will practiſe true Virtue. And others, who have not that deſire, may content themſelves to know the Commands of God in general, ſeeing they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire not to a greater perfection. So I ſay to them, as St. <hi>John</hi> to the ſoldiers, <hi>Uſe no Violence nor fraud to any perſon; and be content with your Wages.</hi> He ſaid ſo to them, becauſe he found them not diſpoſed for greater perfection. And every one is
<pb facs="tcp:65025:24"/>
free, to tend to what degree of perfection he will: So St. <hi>John</hi> chooſes of two Evils the leaſt, in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling the Soldiers, to be content with their Pay, and do no Violence: but if theſe Soldiers had ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded unto <hi>Chriſtian-perfection,</hi> doubtleſs St. <hi>John</hi> had counſelled them, to ceaſe from being Soldiers, and to forſake all that they poſſeſſed, as Jeſus Chriſt did to the young man in the Goſpel, after he ſaid he had kept the Commands of God.</p>
            <p>I ſay the very ſame to them to whom I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent this matter of true Virtue, in theſe twenty four Letters, (which is but the beginning of my deſigns) to ſhew wherein it conſiſts in every thing. To theſe, namely, who will follow it, and to none other: ſeeing that were <hi>to caſt Pearls before Swine, or the Childrens Bread unto Dogs.</hi> Thoſe are ſouls yet earthly and attached to the honours, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and goods of this life; and conſequently are not in a diſpoſition to put true Virtue in practice. It ſeems enough to them not to tranſgreſs groſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and externally the Commands of God; becauſe they know no other Evils, but what are expreſſed in theſe Commands.</p>
            <p>But the ſouls who have abandoned the world, to follow Jeſus Chriſt, and to revive in his ſpirit, muſt labour with all their force to acquire this true Virtue, in renouncing the corruption of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And they may well be aſſured, that they can never arrive at a truely <hi>Chriſtian Life,</hi> unleſs they have overcome the inclinations of that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature. Therefore muſt we labour with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in the mortification of our ſenſes, that we may carry the Victory over that Corruption, which ſin hath brought unto human nature; without that our Virtue is falſe, or only apparent, and in no wiſe Virtue before God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:65025:24"/>For if you ſhew me a perſon, ſober, and chaſt, and upright in his buſineſs, who imparts his Goods to the Poor, who faſts at appointed times, with many other good Deeds; and yet follows the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of corrupt nature: I eſteem nothing all theſe Virtues, if there is not a renounciation of his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature, and he hath not entirely renounced his own will: for all theſe things together come not near the Victory, which is in maſtering the motions of corrupt nature.</p>
            <p>And St. <hi>Paul</hi> names yet greater Virtues, than theſe I have named; when he ſays: <hi>If I had the Gift of Prophecy, and Faith that could remove Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and gave all my Goods to nouriſh the Poor, I am nothing if I want Charity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now Charity is nothing elſe but the love of God, which we cannot obtain but in renouncing ſelf-love, and hating the Corruption of our nature: for we can never do good except we firſt depart from evil; and all ſorts of evil are contained in the corruption of our nature, ſince it is fallen into ſin. So that we can never arrive at true Virtue, but by renouncing that corruption; nor at the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of which the Apoſtle ſpeaks, without having overcome it. So I ſay with him, unto all that would attain to true Virtue, that all other good actions ſhall be nothing, until we have ſurmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and overcome the corruption which ſin hath brought unto humane nature, ſince all ſorts of evil ſpring thence; and therein can no good be found. Though the blindneſs of men, makes them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume that they can do all well, yet they do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together evil, ſo long as they act according to the motions of corrupt nature. And it is only arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance and preſumption of ſpirit, that they think themſelves wiſe, and willing to do all good. For
<pb facs="tcp:65025:25"/>
if man were wiſe, he would always diſtruſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, nor dare undertake any thing; fearing to do evil; ſince that is in him; and there cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed out of a veſſel, other than what is in it.</p>
            <p>When Man was newly created by God, in the ſtate of innocence, he was full of all good, and all ſorts of good proceeded from him: but ſince he is fallen into ſin, he is filled with all evil, and there can nothing proceed out of him, but all evil.</p>
            <p>That is a general rule, and by it ought every one to regulate his life, if he would be ſaved: for there is no exception: ſeeing all men have been corrupted by <hi>Adam's</hi> ſin, and conſequently are filled with evils, none excepted.</p>
            <p>It is true, mens natures differ, in manners and conditions: one is Meek, another Harſh; one is Proud, another Humble: but that is from their natural temperament; becauſe man being compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of four Elements, Water, Fire, Earth and Air; his Manners naturally are diſpoſed with proportion to the element, which predomines in him. For every one hath in his nature divers diſpoſitions. He that in the forming of his body hath contrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted more of Fire, than of the other Elements, will be more cholerique, and luxurious, becauſe the Fire hath more power in him, than the Air Water or Earth. Another who in his formation hath contracted more of Water, will be more dull in his Manners, ſlow in comprehending any thing, and leſs couragious. He that in his formation hath received more of Earth than of other Elements, ſhall be more heavy, lazy and rude in his Manners. Finally, he that in his Formation hath contracted more of Air than other Elements, will be in his manners more light, and inconſtant, and more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in ſpirit, and prompter to good, or evil:
<pb facs="tcp:65025:25"/>
and by theſe natural temperaments, all men are of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers complexions and different manners, according as they have contracted of their Parents the intempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Elements, of which their body is formed.</p>
            <p>But in reſpect of Grace, they are all of a like nature; and are by ſin all fallen into the ſame cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, one as well as the other; and ſo they all need to combate that corruption; ſince they are all equally corrupted by ſin, which they muſt maſter, if they would be ſaved, without going to perſwade that one is better than another, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath in his nature a better temperament. For that nature is nothing as to Grace; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he that hath more of Fire, will be more Virtuous, then he that hath more of Water; ſeeing in caſe he ſerve himſelf of that natural heat, to love God, he will love him ſo much the more: and if he employ his Anger, to defend Juſtice and Virtue, he will do much more good than a phlegmatick perſon, who ordinarily loves only his eaſe. It is the ſame with them, that in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperature of their nature, have contracted more Air, than other Elements; for they will always be more ſubtil, to diſcover Evil, and more prompt to do good; when they will apply themſelves to the ſearch of true Virtue. As he that hath more of Earth, then other Elements, will be more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and grave; and if he apply himſelf to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, he will be more conſtant and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering in it, than the other three. And ſo eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one may be agreeable to God in the ſtate and condition wherein he is produced; provided he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Talent which he hath received, to the Glory of God, and the Salvation of his Soul. Therefore ſays David: <hi>Let all ſpirits praiſe the Lord.</hi> That <gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s not as if he would ſay, that the Devils and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb facs="tcp:65025:26"/>
men praiſe the Lord, ſeeing theſe blaſpheme him: but he gives to underſtand, that all ſpirits, that will become true <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> praiſe the Lord, though they be all of divers natural complexions; ſeeing God is no Reſpecter of Perſons, and does not regard whether we have more of Fire, or of Water, or Earth, or Air, in our natures, but with what affection every one will love and ſerve him.</p>
            <p>Which I regard alſo in writing of Solid Virtue: I mean not to make it heavy and difficult: I would only make it known, to them that will follow and practiſe it; becauſe I love ſuch: So I cannot leave them in ignorance, nor let them pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, amidſt their good will, for want of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wherein true Virtue conſiſts.</p>
            <p>That is it, which hath engaged me to deduce that matter at length, leſt theſe ſouls, which are ſo dear to me, ſhould periſh by ignorance; as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have already, who thought they had acquired true Virtue: while they had only apparent ones, or curious Speculations of Virtue; not knowing that it conſiſts in the overcoming of corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in true Humility, and voluntary Poverty. Though Jeſus Chriſt hath ſo much taught it by Word and Works, yet it is not followed in the practice; for want of good Explication, and the Light of the Truth. Which God having given me, I will willingly impart it to others; in ſending to light this firſt part of true Virtue. And with time and opportunity, I ſhall preſent more, to the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, and the Salvation of ſouls, who aſpire after true Virtue and Perfection. What I offer them at preſent is with good heart, as a Preſent come from heaven, which ſhall ſhew them the light of the Truth, and manifeſt the deceits of falſe Virtue, as alſo the means to arrive at that which is ſolid and true.</p>

            <head>THE FIRST LETTER. That all Chriſtians ought to learn of Jeſus Chriſt Meekneſs, Mildneſs, Gentleneſs, and Lowlineſs of Heart.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>Written to one deſirous of true virtue: Shewing him, that to attain thereto, we muſt have ſubmiſſion and obedience, by which we may begin to learn meekneſs, lowlineſs and humility of heart.</p>
            </argument>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Dear Child;</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Perceive you have not yet compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended well what Jeſus Chriſt tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; ſaying, learn of me, for I am meek and lowly, and humble of heart: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe upon occaſion you do not exerciſe it enough; but yield looſe reins to your nature: for when it enclines to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, you ſpeak harſhly; and ſometimes uſe force and violence to fulfil what you have reſolved, as well in ſmall matters as in great: which does not teſtify humility of heart, ſeeing the humble heart yields willingly to another in things not evil, and does not imagin that another ought to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low our will. But it is always willing to follow anothers will in whatever is not contrary to God, and the perfection of its own ſoul</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe you may well have obſerved that in me; for ordinarily I inform my ſelf of the will of my brethren, to Know what they love beſt in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different things; and I have more contentment to do any thing after their deſires, than after my own;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65025:31"/>
for that yields me more quiet and inward peace, feeling a certain ſatisfaction to ſee them content and joyful. And even my nature enclines to it, by the habit which I've uſed to reſiſt my own will in every thing: and being overcome, it rules over all things, and has no grudge for whatſoever comes contrary to it, provided it be not againſt the glory of God or the love of our neighbour. All be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide is indifferent to me; if it is rain, or fair weather; if I eat harſh meats or ſweet, when they wrong not my health; if I be alone, or in company, ſo that the one be as wholeſome as the other: And finally, I'm as well content to be in one coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey as another; providing I have the ſame occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to live well. And ſo I am comforted in every event: whether I be ſick or in health, I have no chooſe, in caſe I honour God as well in one ſtate as in another: it is all one to me, and I would never chooſe any thing, ſo that I receive from the hand of God whatſoever comes to paſs: and ſo I as always content and joyful.</p>
            <p>If you knew but to learn that method, you would be very happy, and continually in quiet: whereas now, fretting and diſcontent, you diſquiet and trouble your Spirit, and are burthenſome to others, and ſo hinder mutual love: for a bitter word is pleaſant to no body, and a mild one mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifies the heart, even of a furious perſon. I know your heart is good; and that you hate no perſon, notwithſtanding to judge by the tone of your voice, one would ſay, that you are envious, and they that know not your heart, think you are in rage: you muſt know, that they are not always diſpoſed to bear with you, and that may marr the peace, and diminiſh charity, which Jeſus Chriſt hath ſo much recommended to Chriſtians; Saying, <hi>if you love</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:65025:31"/>
               <hi>one another, thereby ſhall all men know that you are my diſciples</hi>; I believe you love the brethren in the bottom of your heart; but ſometimes you ſpeak to them, as if you hated them, and would not hear them ſpeak. If they ſpoke as you do, you would have difficulty to ſuffer them: So you ought to conſider that they have much to ſuffer that you ſpeak ſo harſhly. They do very well in ſuffering you, but it is no advantage for your ſoul: for if all the world ſhould bear with you, that will not juſtifie you before God, nor will your nature for that change its evil inclinations; but be ſtrengthned in them: And ſo you ſhall be in danger to live and die imperfect; which you would regret much before God, when too late.</p>
            <p>Therefore it is much better, to endeavour now to overcome that bilious humour, which is in your nature; than be Slave to a wrathful paſſion, which maſters you, whereas you ſhould govern it: and uſe it only when it concerns the maintaining the truth and defence of the glory of God. Then is it that there is place for anger, as the ſcripture alſo ſays, <hi>be angry, and ſin not.</hi> But we muſt never be angry for things indifferent, and of ſmall import; much leſs ſpeak harſhly, becauſe Jeſus Chriſt ſays, we muſt be meek and lowly of heart. That is a leſſon he gives to all Chriſtians; and exhorts them to learn it of him; rather than the other marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous things he did on earth. He does not bid them learn to raiſe the dead, to heal the ſick, or to do other miracles. But expreſly to learn of him to be meek, lowly and humble of heart.</p>
            <p>And therefore is it (my Child) that I counſel you to labour to acquire that meekneſs, ſince it is good, wholſome and taught by J. Chr. himſelf, who pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed it; and tells, that we ſhould learn it of him.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65025:32"/>
I know very well that you will find ſome little repugnancy to it, and that you muſt do violence to your nature, ſeeing it inclines always more to harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs than to meekneſs, but we muſt take the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven by force; for it is written, <hi>that the violent take it by force.</hi> Eternal life deſerves well a little ſuffering, and alſo the violence which we muſt uſe to reſiſt our evil habits; for theſe ſufferings are but of ſhort continuance, whereas the eternal joy they purchaſe ſhall never end. Theſe conſiderations may well make the greateſt afflictions we can endure in reſiſting our ſelves, appear but light. Therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve with your ſelf to overcome that paſſion of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, it is it which torments you moſt, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the devil moſt advantage againſt your ſoul.</p>
            <p>Watch over your ſelf therefore, that you may reſiſt it upon occaſion; for the firſt motions of anger are not in your power, becauſe of the evil habit, which your parents have not correcterd in your youth: and ſo it is become as natural to you, and is ſtirred up almoſt at every occaſion. You ought therefore to uſe continual prayer, to reſiſt theſe continual mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The ſin is not to feel them, but to conſent to them: and therefore when you feel the motions of anger, give not place to them; but return in to your ſelf, and pray to God for ſtrength to reſiſt them. In that caſe hold your peace, becauſe you would not ſpeak meekly as Jeſus Chriſt teaches you ſhould: and when others ſpeak what you are unwilling to hear; with-draw, rather than anſwer them. So ſhall you by little and little overcome that inclination; and become meek and gentle. As for humbleneſs of heart, it conſiſts in ſubmitting willingly to the will of others in all good, or indifferent things. And believe aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly, that ſo long as you find a repugnancy to yield to anothers will, its a token that your heart is not
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65025:32"/>
humble: ſince it would have another to yield to it, and will not yield to him. An humble heart always diſtruſts it ſelf, and deſires rather to obey than to command: it ſubmits always its opinion to that of others, and will not contend to maintain its own; eſteeming it the leaſt of any, and therefore yields wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly to every body in matters good, or indifferent.</p>
            <p>My Child, if you had that humility of heart which J. Ch. requires, you would be happy, and content; for nothing would ever arrive againſt your will: which being ſubmitted to God, would always receive every thing from his hand, although they came by wicked men, or the devil himſelf, which could not hurt you when you refer them to God. And the devil will not long vex a humble heart; for humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity diſpleaſes him; he flyes from the humble, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he cannot gain upon them: and he ſearches out the proud, becauſe they are more liker himſelf: As the birds of one feather flock together. Therefore if you will be free from the devil, be humble of heart; for ſo ſoon as you've learnt that vertue, he will inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly flee from you, and at length ſtrive no more againſt you; but you muſt have a true humility of heart, not conſiſting in humble outward actions, but in the inward motions of your heart, which from the bottom ought not to deſire to be eſteemed and honoured, far leſs followed and obeyed: but a hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble heart honours and eſteems others and obeys them willingly, ſeeing there's nothing gives more quiet to man than obedience; for he that has no more to do but obey, needs not deviſe in his mind what to do or ſpeak; he hath but to hear what is ſaid to him, and follow it; Living ſo as a Child, without care, except that of pleaſing God, which ſhould yield great quiet outward and inward.</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe no body (even naturally) can deſire to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65025:33"/>
command, at leaſt without he have a proud and arrogant heart, deſiring dominion over others; for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and obedience is pleaſant and agreeable; and we find by experience, that he who takes his own will, hath often regret and diſſatisfaction after, and is diſcontent for doing ſo. Which flows thence, that our proper will is corrupted by ſin; and ſo produces all ſorts of noxious corruption to him that follows it. How many have ruined and made themſelves miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for all their life, by following their own will? One hath engaged himſelf in ſome marriage to his hurt; another follows the wars, taken ſome charge; or undertaken ſome buſineſs which hath empoveriſh't and rendred them miſerable: yea and by grief and melancholy cauſed their death. And all this, becauſe they would follow their own will; without taking counſel, or ſubmitting to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. And ſuch are forced to ſuffer and endure the adverſities which their own wills have cauſed; but he that can find a diſintereſſed perſon, and obeys him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to God; is moſt happy and content: As the proverb is, <hi>He that plays the fool by counſel does it well.</hi> That is, not that any folly is good, but to ſhow that he who ſubmits his will to God and the goſpel councels; does always well, alhough men ſhould judge it folly; as moſt part do at this day judge it to follow theſe councels expreſly according to the letter. So it is folly to human ſence, to deſpiſe the goods, riches and pleaſures of this life, to become humble and mean with Jeſus Chriſt; but he that playes the fool at that rate, fool's well.</p>
            <p>Not that I would counſel you (my Child) to be ſubmiſſive and obedient in matters of importance to men, that live yet after their proper wills (as well as you) for that would oft times be evil, the corrupt will of another being evil as well as yours.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65025:33"/>
Yet it will be profitable for your perfection to obey them in things indifferent, or of ſmall conſequence, when they do hurt to no perſon: And thereby you ſhall overcome your own corruption; and ſhall accuſtom your ſelf to ſubmit to what is well-pleaſing to God, voluntarily; for habit changes into nature; and he that accuſtoms himſelf to ſubmit to men for his own perfection; it will be eaſie and pleaſant to him to ſubmit to God for the ſame, doing it without any repugnance of his nature: which being accuſtomed to obey in indifferent things, will find pleaſure to obey in good things; and hence your heart may find always quiet and contentment.</p>
            <p>But ſo long as you ſhall be unexerciſed in this obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and ſubmiſſion of your Spirit, you will have troubles and debates in your ſelf, and ſhall not be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of others, nor united in the ſame will with them: as God hath commanded us; ſaying, <hi>be united together in one will</hi>: which we do not yet obſerve; for our wills are as diverſe as there as different perſons of us, which teſtifies a pride of heart in all, far from obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the counſels which J. C. teaches: viz. <hi>to learn of him, who is meek, and lowly, and humble of heart:</hi> that leſſon ought to be well kept, and practiſed upon every occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. We have ſubject enough: for being an aſſembly of perſons that endeavour after perfection, there is no fear of doing evil in obeying one another; as it often happens in the world, where we cannot ſubmit to any perſon without offending God, ſeeing they are all full of ſins and evil inclinations; which we muſt reſiſt rather than obey: for many well-enclined per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, have loſt themſelves by endeavouring to pleaſe the wicked, and by that means had part in their ſins.</p>
            <p>We are by the grace of God free of that danger, ſeeing all our company are perſons of a good will and labour for the perfection of their ſouls; ſo that you
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65025:34"/>
cannot do it to yield to them in indifferent, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally in good things. Examin always if what they counſel or propoſe be good, and when you cannot aſſuredly find that it is ſuch; examin if it is evil, if it may do hurt, or bring prejudice to any body: and if you think ſo, you muſt excuſe your ſelf from yielding with all the mildneſs you can: and ſo you ſhall irritate no body, though you follow not their will: But if you reſiſt them with harſh and pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing words, deſigning to correct or rebuke them, you had better hold your peace as ſpeak.</p>
            <p>But I'm unwilling to believe, that ſuch caſes will happen in our company; becauſe I truſt none of them will ever give himſelf to evil things; they may well afford occaſion one to another to exerciſe patience; for being all imperfect, every one hath his own failing which Chriſtian-charity ought to ſupport: and that ſhould perfect you together: for if you had nothing to bear with in your brother, you ſhould never know how far you have advanced in virtue, ſeeing the heart of man is deceitful, and flatters it ſelf al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, and knows not it ſelf till the emergents and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions offer, which try how much meekneſs and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility it hath, which it would not know other ways: And conſequenly, you ſhould love the opportunities of ſuffering; that you may be exerciſed in Chriſtian perfection. You will not always have ſo much op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, as now, while all the brethren are yet ſo imperfect, and humility of heart ſo little put in practice. So let not the preſent occaſion eſcape; for what is paſt, is not in your power; and what's to come is uncertain. There is only the preſent moment, we have to uſe for perfecting our ſelves. Look not to the failings of others; for every one muſt labour for his own advancement, and not render an accompt of his brother. Do ſo as having nothing elſe to do, but to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65025:34"/>
perfect your ſoul, and fulfil the will of God; for there is only that which concerns you: for if all the men in the world were Saints, and you not, their virtues would not in the leaſt profit you; and alſo if you be virtuous, and all others vicious, that will not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh your virtue: for God will not require an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of others from you; but will judge every one according to his works.</p>
            <p>So that when you have overcome your ſelf, you overcome all the world, and nothing can let your perfection; for even the faults of others, will ſerve you, as a means to exerciſe your patience, and become meek, mild and humble of heart, as J. Ch. counſels: And the virtues of others will excite you to greater virtue; ſo that you ſhall rule over every one; for he that hath overcome his paſſions, is king over all the earth, and hath ſubjected all things to himſelf; not being moved for whatſoever happens. Behold a bleſſed ſtate, and yet eaſie to be attained, provided they embrace the means. They may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one paſſion at once; and ſo get over them all in the end. I counſel you to begin with obedience, ſeeing with it you may overcome divers of your paſſions at once. For I ſhall frequently order you things which your nature has a repugnancy againſt; and if you perform them without gain ſaying, you ſhall ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come its corruption, although they be but ſmall inconſiderable matters, you obey in: for it is the fault of that corruption, not to yield willingly to another, and would always be in the right, and thinks it hath reaſon in all it imagins: which proceeds from the haughtineſs of heart, that would always have deference, and will yield to none: It thinks always it ſelf wiſer and clearer-ſighted than another. And from that you muſt diſengage it, and oblige it to ſubmit to every one in things good or indifferent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:65025:35"/>As for me, I did ſo; and have thence found great advantages for the perfection of my ſoul; I ſubmitted always my ſelf to whomſoever I converſed with; and have endeavoured from the beginning to diſcover their inclinations, that I might conform my ſelf to them; and I did it ſo abſolutely, that ſometimes I perceived not the evil that was in them, to oppoſe it: but ſince, that God has given me more light, I obey not men, but in things that are good or indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. And I exhort you, my dear Child, to do the ſame; that you may become by little and little agreeable to your heavenly father. Which is the earneſt deſire of her who loves your ſoul, to render it unto God, unto whom it belongs.</p>

            <head>THE II. LETTER. That all Chriſtians ought to learn of Jeſus Chriſt Meekneſs, Lowlineſs and Humility of heart.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>Shewing wherein conſiſts meekneſs and lowlineſs; which are fruits of the Holy Spirit; and cannot be obtained, unleſs we renounce our own will, ſubmitting to the will of God.</p>
            </argument>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Dear Child;</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Perceive you have not yet comprehended the words of J. Chriſt, where he ſays: that we muſt
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65025:35"/>
               <hi>learn of him to be meek and lowly, and humble of heeart.</hi> Therefore you muſt know what that meekneſs is, otherwiſe you cannot love it; for one cannot have a perfect love for what he does not at all know; and the reaſon why true virtue is ſo little loved, is becauſe it is ſo little known: many think it is a viſible, material and bodily thing, and thence is hypocriſie bred in mens hearts; who perſwade themſelves, that they are vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, becauſe of doing ſome external good works: whereas there is nothing of the eſſence of virtue in them: for true virtue is a Spiritual thing, which ſhould poſſeſs the hearts of men; and it cannot be ſeen nor felt, but by the operations it produces, ſpringing from the bottom of the heart: and if theſe operations proceed not from that bottom, but are only ſtudied, or practiſed to pleaſe men, or for our proper ſatisfaction; they are but moral and temporary virtues, which add nothing to our ſouls, and cannot have the recompenſe of eternal life.</p>
            <p>They may indeed be a mean to attain to true vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, when our deſign is to aſpire and arrive at it; but the miſery is, that many reſt at theſe means and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal virtues, as if that were the end. And ſo they think they have virtue indeed; whereas they have it only in ſhadow, not in reality.</p>
            <p>And therefore is it, that I teach you what true virtue is, and particularly what is that meekneſs which J. Ch. ſays <hi>we muſt learn of him.</hi> It is nothing elſe but a peace, quiet, and tranquillity of Spirit, which reſides in the bottom of our ſoul; and all theſe are Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual qualities, which cannot be ſeen or felt but by their outward operations. But the eſſence of that virtue of meekneſs is a divine quality, and you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not judge by the outward actions if one poſſeſſes it: for one may well learn to ſpeak mildly, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the mildneſs which J. Ch. ſays we muſt learn of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65025:36"/>
him. We may learn meek words like a Perroquet, and ſpeak ſo perhaps for civility or by hypocricy: for I have known perſons that appeared moſt meek in their carriage, who inwardly were wicked and arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant. And therefore we muſt not amuſe our ſelves at that outward mildneſs which is often deceitful, and but natural: for there are perſons ſo faint-hearted that they fear to ſpeak a harſh word, left it give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves trouble by as harſh an anſwer: and that Silly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs makes them mild and calm both to good and evil. And yet ſuch dare believe, that they have the virtue of meekneſs, when it is only a vice of ſloath and injuſtice; which makes them yield to the ſin of others, inſtead of reſiſting it with diligence and courage; but they will not take ſo much trouble.</p>
            <p>It is not then that falſe meekneſs, which I exhort you unto, my Child; for ſo you ſhould not learn that which J. Ch. teaches: but I would gladly make you comprehend what is that true meekneſs, that you might love and follow it. It is then an inward peace, a quiet of conſcience, and tranquillity of Spirit, which dwells in the bottom of our ſoul: behold what that meekneſs which J. Ch. recommends to learn of him, contains; Himſelf practiced that meekneſs all the time of his mortal life: and you may obſerve from that, if there be at preſent any ſouls poſſeſſed by his Spirit; that is, who have effectually thoſe three qualities in their ſouls; for otherways they cannot be poſſeſſed of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>Obſerve well in me, If I have peace in my ſoul, quiet of conſcience and tranquillity in my Spirit: And if you diſcover in me theſe qualities, believe aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly that you may obtain them alſo; <hi>for God refuſes not his graces to them that ask and deſire them:</hi> and he will be loath to refuſe that of meekneſs when J. Ch. ſays, that we muſt learn it of him; for he will not
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65025:36"/>
command us to learn, that which is impoſſible. God is juſt, and therefore he hath not taught us any thing by Jeſus Chriſt, but what he will readily give us.</p>
            <p>That Spirit of meekneſs and gentleneſs is the Holy Spirit; which J. Ch. ſays ſhall not be refuſed to any; bringing us this compariſon, to the purpoſe; <hi>who is he of you, who when his ſon asks bread, will give him a ſtone; or if he demand fiſh, will give him a ſerpent?</hi> And he Draws this concluſion; <hi>If you then being evil, know to give good things to your children, how much more ſhall not your heavenly father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All the evil conſiſts in that we do not deſire him; and that deſire cannot be great in us, as long as we do not know him. Many ſay, that the Holy Spirit does not work in ſouls now adays as he did in the days of J. Chriſt rand his Apoſtles; becauſe they do not ſee him in form of a dove, as he appeared at the baptiſm of J. Chr. or as tongues of fire, as on the Apoſtles at Pentecoſt, which is a very feeble argument: For the Holy Ghoſt is not limited to times, being an eternal God, who gives his gifts and bears his fruits at all times; and will do to all eternity, ſeeing he can never be barren nor idle, operating always in the ſouls that are diſpoſed thereto: and if we ſee not now theſe tongues of fire, that dove, or other external ſigns, it is becauſe we need them no more now, the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel law and the doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt being ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently confirmed; at leaſt there is no Chriſtian (as I believe) that calls it in queſtion.</p>
            <p>Moreover, theſe external forms added nothing to the ſouls of thoſe that received the Holy Ghoſt: but ſerved only to convince the hard-heartedneſs of the incredulous. And therefore true believers have no need to ſee external figures, to believe that the Holy Spirit dwells yet in the ſoul of him that is thereto
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65025:37"/>
diſpoſed. They can well examin it themſelves knowing but what the Holy Spirit is, what are his gifts, what his graces, and what his fruits: of which the meekneſs we muſt learn of Jeſus Chriſt is one: And though it be declared in divers places of Scripture, yet it is all the ſame thing. For J. Ch. ſays, <hi>Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly</hi>; and St. <hi>Paul</hi> puts among the twelve fruits of the Holy Spirit <hi>goodneſs and benigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>; which is the ſame thing pronounced in different words and is in ſubſtance, the peace, quiet, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of Spirit, reſiding in the ſoul, that hath theſe three internal qualities. Theſe ſigns are aſſured teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the habitation of the Holy Spirit. For the natural Spirit cannot give true peace, nor true quiet, nor true tranquility of Spirit, as give the meekneſs and lowlineſs which J. Chriſt ſays <hi>we muſt learn of him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe by theſe, My Child, you comprehend ſufficiently what is that meekneſs and lowlineſs which J. Ch. teaches. And alſo that you have remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked enough, that I poſſeſs it in my ſoul: ſeeing you ſee me in inward peace, quiet of conſcience, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility of Spirit, without notable change; but yet you know not how you may come to feel the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of that meekneſs of J. Ch. in your ſoul. I know certainly you love them ſo far as you know them, but you know not how to attain to them: Which I ſhall alſo teach you, if you will give good attention, and follow my counſel; for it is very eaſie to obtain the meekneſs which J. Ch. teaches, if you will empty your ſoul of what hinders it, and abſolutely become a diſciple of J. Ch. and follow his doctrines. And if you feel not in your ſoul, true inward peace, quiet of conſcience and tranquility of Spirit, you may believe you have not yet learnt of J. Ch. his meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and lowlineſs; and ſo you muſt embrace the means to attain to it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:65025:37"/>The firſt and fundamental means is abſolutely to will and deſire it; which I believe by the grace of God you do. In the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. place you muſt endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move all impediments, which retard that peace, quiet, and tranquility of Spirit: theſe impediments are in our corrupt nature; for from ſin men are fal<gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> into a continual trouble, war and diſquiet; and our paſſions being diſordered, breed all theſe; and they cannot be governed, ordered and kept in peace except we have reſiſted and overcome them, and alſo altogether renounced our natural inclinations: and then is it that we find peace, quiet and tranquility of Spirit, and not before.</p>
            <p>Behold wherefore it is, that J. Ch. ſays, <hi>we muſt Deny our ſelves if we would be his Diſciples</hi>; for that renouncing of our paſſions alone, is the true means to attain to that peace, quiet, and tranquillity of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: For ſince ſin came, our paſſions bereave us of theſe; which before ſin, were well regulated, and temperate, bringing joy, peace and tranquility to our ſouls; whereas now we feel the quite contrary: For if we ſuffer our paſſions to rule, they will lead us to intemperance, ſadneſs and diſquiet of Spirit. So that it is impoſſible for one that lives according to his natural ſenſes, to learn the Meekneſs and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs which J. Ch. teaches us. And it is for that he adds the goſpel doctrine: <hi>That we muſt Deny our ſelves.</hi> For th'one cannot be without the other: if we will be meek and lowly, as J. Ch teaches, we muſt of neceſſity deny our ſelves; ſeeing our nature hath nothing but harſhneſs and fretting, which cauſes trouble of Spirit, and diſquiet in the will, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention with our neighbour: for he that has not meekneſs in himſelf, cannot have peace with his neighbour; except it be a Diſſembled or civil peace; which yields not inward quiet, nor tranquillity of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65025:38"/>
Spirit. As I believe, My Child, you feel in yourſelf; for though you have a quiet of conſcience, becauſe you have abandoned the world, and the occaſions of ſin; yet you have not that inward peace which would render your Spirit tranquile and peaceable. For you act yet with Diſturbance, which proceeds from corrupted and diſtempered paſſions. So if you knew to vanquiſh that, and calm theſe unprofitable agitations, it were your great advantage, and you would eaſily obtain the meekneſs which Jeſus Chriſt teaches: as alſo lowlineſs, and gentleneſs; ſeeing theſe two are knit together: meekneſs of heart en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genders gentleneſs toward our neighbour: for he that is tranquile and peaceable in himſelf, will not trouble his neighbour, nor give any occaſion of fretting; ſeeing the meekneſs of the good, quenches the wrath of the wicked. And though one that has learnt the meekneſs and gentleneſs of Jeſus Chriſt were ſurrounded with troubles of all ſorts, he will yet keep a tranquile Spirit. Becauſe he does no more follow the motions of his corrupt nature, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains peace, quiet and tranquility of Spirit, where it is obtained by the meekneſs and gentleneſs of J. Chr.</p>
            <p>My Child, if you would alſo learn that Leſſon, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to Deny your ſelf, and not follow your own will in any thing. For Since it was corrupted by ſin, it always enclines to evil; ſuſpect whatever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from your own will, and follow it in nothing; it is it which bereaves you of the meekneſs and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs which Jeſus Chriſt teaches; and we have no greater enemy in the world than our proper will. If you could well comprehend that truth, doubtleſs, you would not follow it in any thing; and you would Diſtruſt even your Good Wills and intentions, and ſuſpect them; but becauſe you know not yet well, that your proper will is ſo evil, you do not
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65025:38"/>
diſtruſt it: Notwithſtanding is betrays you often; and it leads you to do evil often when you would do good; your bottom and inward intention is good, but your proper will oppoſes your good deſires, and makes you often do the contrary of what you have well reſolved. If I were in your place, I would not follow my own will in any thing, and hold all my own beſt wills for evil; ſeeing there can never come good out of what is altogether corrupt; as our will is become through ſin, ſo that no good can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from it. Whatever is good, muſt proceed from God: And whatever is evil, from the Devil, and the corrupted will of man. It is as a fire, which kindles in our nature luxury, anger, and all ſorts of intemperance: it is inſatiable; never ſatisfied; ever deſiring what it hath not; reſtleſs in its deſires; turbulent in its ſearches; ever panting, and never refreſhed nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; in the end our proper will creates us more evil than the Devil himſelf; who could in no wiſe hurt us, if our proper will did not conſent thereto. So that when we have overcome our own will, we have overcome the devil alſo. For he can never make us ſin, but in moving our will to ſubmit to him: It is for that, that I ſaid, man can never have a greater enemy than his proper will; and conſequently every one in particular, and all men in general, ought to make war with their proper wills: yet how few eſteem it their enemy, and a great many idolize it; eſteeming themſelves happy that they can follow it in every thing, without conſidering that it brings death to the ſoul; and hinders the will of God to be fulfilled in us. For he that follows his own will is not ſubject to the will of God; ſeeing theſe two are always contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. So that he who will accompliſh the will of God muſt of neceſſity renounce his own will; and who will learn of J. Chriſt meekneſs and lowlineſs, muſt refuſe
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65025:39"/>
every thing to his proper will: and ſo be ſhall poſſeſs in his ſoul peace, quiet and tranquility of Spirit; which I pray God grant you by renouncing your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per will? which is the only means to make you hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in this world, and to all eternity; as wiſhes ſhe that deſires your Salvation.</p>

               <salute>My Child;</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Believe you underſtand ſufficiently by my former what that meekneſs and lowlineſs is which we muſt learn of J. Ch. how it is pleaſant to obey; how mans proper will is corrupted by ſin; and how we muſt now fight with and overcome it, if we will find peace in our ſouls, quiet of conſcience, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility in our Spirit.</p>
            <p>But you cannot comprehend how you may ſo
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65025:39"/>
know the will of God in every thing, to follow it, in quitting your proper will.</p>
            <p>Believe me, that ſcruple proceeds from your corrupt nature, which would willingly be diſpenſed, or excuſed from being obliged to renounce your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per will, which it loves and would follow, if it can eſcape the obligation of reſiſting it; and ſo perſwades it ſelf, that it does not know the will of God in every thing, to do it. The heart of man is even ſo deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that it perſwades its proper underſtanding that we know not the will of God, and conſequently can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not follow it in every thing. But that is a deceit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by Satan, to amuſe us by falſe reaſons and fine appearances of truth: which are in effect but wicked falſities. For all Chriſtians can know the will of God if they take pains to inform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but for the moſt part they are willing to be ignorant of it, becauſe they have not a mind to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh it when they do know it; And they do cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly beyond doubt know it; but the love they bear to themſelves, and the little love they bear to God, makes them ſay, that they know not his will; &amp; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they have the confidence to ſay (lying) they would do it if they knew it. For that is falſe; but mans heart deceives ſometimes it ſelf, ſo that it ſelf does not know the deceit; and gives it ſelf to believe that its falſhoods are truth, which cauſes ſeveral to live in quiet, believing themſelves aſſured in the midſt of perils of their Salvation.</p>
            <p>Therefore we may well deſire to diſcover the truth in a matter of ſo great concern, on which depends our eternal happineſs: and never ſleep upon a falſe bolſter of Deceiving ſuppoſitions; for he that ſins igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly, goes ignorantly to hell. Seeing all Chriſtians are obliged to know the will of God, which is alſo clearly manifeſted to them by his commands, and yet
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65025:40"/>
more particularly by the doctrine of J. Ch. for there be few Chriſtians that know not that God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded men <hi>to love him with all their heart, and their neighbour as themſelves</hi>; and there are yet fewer that obſerve theſe commands; and with that they ſay, If I knew the will of God, I would follow it; and ſo they lie to God and to themſelves, perſwading themſelves they ſpeak truth: ſo great is the darkneſs in which men live at this day, in regard of their Salvation.</p>
            <p>We may truly ſay, that it is at this day that they are abandoned to the Spirit of error and wickneſs; and that the Scripture ſays with good reaſon, <hi>that all men are liars</hi>: ſeeing they now lie to themſelves to the prejudice of their eternal ſalvation; and that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times without knowing it. For in that they ſay, if they knew the will of God, they would follow it; is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood, both in the well-intentioned and in the wicked; ſince we ſee in effect, that neither the one nor the other do it, in the firſt command, viz. <hi>to love God with all our heart, and our neighbour as our ſelves.</hi> For to love God with all our heart, we muſt love nothing elſe but him only; otherwiſe our heart were divided and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: inſtead of being whole in the love of one God: ſo that if we love riches, and the pleaſures of this life, and honour, &amp;c. we do not love God with all our heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though we know that to be his will. And when we envy the happineſs of our neighbour, and do not aſſiſt him in his need, we do not love him as our ſelves; and we often do to him what we would not ſhould be done to our ſelves. Wherein we do not the will of God, though we know aſſuredly, that his will is, that we love our neighbour as our ſelves; and ſo we do not practice the will of God which we know: but we ſeek beſide that ſo clearly revealed, a more particular will in things little needful; and neglect to do his will in that which regards our eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:65025:40"/>It is therefore much to be feared, that we would not do the will of God in ſmall things, though we did know it; ſeeing we do it not in things ſo great and ſo advantagious to our eternal ſalvation. So that it were to tempt God, to ask what is his will in all things, while we do not fulfil it in the principal things, as are his expreſs commands and ſaving ordinances.</p>
            <p>I hear ſometimes ſaid, that it is a very ſweet thing and great happineſs to have the will of God diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in every thing; eſteeming that a particular grace and extraordinary happineſs. And yet if that mercy were given them; it is to be feared it would turn to their greater condemnation; <hi>for he that knows the father's will, and does it not, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes.</hi> And the reaſon why God does not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate himſelf to all Chriſtians, is, becauſe they are not ready nor diſpoſed to perform his will when it ſhall be contrary to their own. And therefore every one ought to endeavour to fulfil the will of God which he knows by his commands; rather than go to and demand of God particular things, ſo long as he does not perform the principal things, as are the commands of God or the counſels of J. Ch. and theſe counſels explain yet more particularly the will of God, than did the commands in general. For J. Ch. deduces particularly all what we ought to do and leave, to fulfil that command of loving God with all our heart, and our neighbour as our ſelves: Saying, <hi>Learn of me, for I am meek and Lowly</hi>; which teaches the love of God and of our neighbour: for the meekneſs ſignifies love of the goodneſs of God, and lowlineſs the Love of our neighbour. Meekneſs or goodneſs is one of the eſſential qualities of God, which ſeems to ſurpaſs his other qualities: it is like oyl among other liquors, which ſwims always above <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for we ſee in a<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>l Gods works his goodneſs ſuperabound over his other
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65025:41"/>
qualities; though that goodneſs be never ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from his juſtice and truth, yet it excels over them.</p>
            <p>For we ſee in many things where God hath ſtayed his wrath to give place to his mercy, when men would turn; as he did to the people of <hi>Nineveh,</hi> who by their ſins had juſtly merited that Gods juſtice ſhould be executed againſt them. Yea, and the truth of God had foretold their deſtruction within forty days: but as ſoon as that people returned to repentance, the goodneſs of God gets uppermoſt, and ſwims above his juſtice and truth, and pardons them by his great meekneſs and goodneſs; So that we may with truth ſay, that the goodneſs of God is over his other qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities. And ſeeing J. Ch. exhorts us, to be perfect as our heavenly father is perfect: we muſt labour particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly for that virtue of meekneſs and lowlineſs which Jeſus Chriſt teaches to learn of him: that we may tend to that perfection of our heavenly father; and when we have in the bottom of our ſoul juſtice and truth for a foundation to Chriſtian perfection, we muſt build upon that, meekneſs and gentleneſs; ſeeing that virtue will make us fulfil the command, of <hi>Loving God with all our heart, and our neighbour as our ſelves,</hi> wherein the ſcripture ſays, <hi>all the law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets are contained</hi>: and that becauſe juſtice and truth reſpects God; but meekneſs and goodneſs reſpects alſo our neighbour. And although one were juſt and true before God, he muſt alſo be meek and good; otherways he loves not his neighbour as himſelf; ſeeing he gives not that teſtimony of his love which that command requires: And becauſe only God knows the heart, it is not enough that goodneſs be in any, it muſt alſo be teſtified outwardly by gentleneſs, or elſe our neighbour ſhould not be edifyed thereby: and therefore is it that J. Ch. ſays, we muſt learn of him meekneſs and lowlineſs or gentleneſs: he ſpoke
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65025:41"/>
no ſuperfluous word in diſtinguishing meekneſs and gentleneſs; but he gives us to underſtand, that it is not enough to have goodneſs within us, but we muſt alſo teſtify it outwardly by meekneſs and gentleneſs toward our neighbour.</p>
            <p>Therefore, My Child, exerciſe your ſelf in that virtue, and pray to God that you may attain meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and gentleneſs: he will never be wanting on his part to give you his grace to practiſe them, if you will not be wanting on yours. It is one of his commands, and he will never fail to afford grace to obey in what he hath commanded; otherwiſe J. Ch. would not bid us <hi>Learn of him to be Meek &amp; Lowly,</hi> if he knew not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well that God will ſurely give theſe virtues to them that ſeek and deſire them: and if you do not feel them yet in your ſoul, it is a token, you have not yet enough demanded and deſired them. And it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps becauſe you have not till now diſcovered that they are neceſſary to ſalvation, and contained in the commandments of God, and ſo have not laboured to your power to acquire them: but you have ſimply followed the motions of your nature, which does not encline to meekneſs and gentleneſs, but to harſhneſs and fretting.</p>
            <p>But our nature is as a horſe, to which ſometimes you muſt uſe a Bridle, ſometimes Spurs, to make it turn and march where it is needful. And though it have repugnance to act contrary to its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and inclinations; we muſt not for that give it free bridle to go where it pleaſes, becauſe our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per will is always evil; ſince it was corrupted by ſin; and is no more capable to make one good deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination; but it ought to be kept in with a bridle, and governed by reaſon, as they do a horſe with a bridle, otherwiſe it would precipitate our ſouls into hell.</p>
            <p>Now your reaſon can eaſily perceive, that you
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65025:42"/>
muſt keep the commandments of God to be ſaved; and follow the counſels of J. Ch. to be a Chriſtian. It is then the duty of that reaſon to bridle and lead your nature into the way of Salvation, and ſure path of the goſpel law, ſeeing you would be a Chriſtian, and ſave your ſoul. You muſt not then obey the motions and inclinations of your nature, but God, who hath shown us particularly what is his will, by the goſpel advices which J. Ch. hath given us; ſaying, <hi>learn of me, for I am meek and lowly, and humble of heart:</hi> he could not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter expreſs what God requires of us, than by theſe expreſs terms of meekneſs and lowlineſs, and humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of heart. For every one can underſtand by theſe terms what is the will of God, and what he requires of all Chriſtians. Endeavour firſt of all to acquire theſe virtues: and after, if you need other particular know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to diſcover his will, without doubt, he will reveal them to you in due time, and will never be wanting to reveal to us, what we have a deſire to obey; no more than he will be wanting to give his graces neceſſary to attain to Chriſtian perfection. For he deſires our perfection more than our ſelves do; and ſo is far from refuſing his graces, that we may ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at it, if we will but ask them with humility of heart.</p>
            <p>For without humility of heart, no prayers are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God: and our meekneſs and gentleneſs cannot be good, if it is not accompanied with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility of heart. For one may be meek and gentle by nature, diſſimulation, or hypocricy, which is often ſin before God in lieu of virtue. For that ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>parent and phariſaticall lowlineſs is not praiſe-worthy but before men, and J Ch tells us, <hi>except our righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs exceed that of the phariſees, we ſhall not enter into the kingdom of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That we might underſtand, that no moral virtues,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65025:42"/>
that proceed not from the bottom of our heart, and ingendred there by a divine faith, can have an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal recompenſe; and are recompenſed only by the praiſe of men, who being material judge by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance; but God ſearches the hearts and tryes the conſciences. And therefore it is that Jeſus Chriſt ſays, we muſt have <hi>humility of heart, with meekneſs and lowlineſs:</hi> as being three things knit together, which cannot be ſeparated one from the other; no more than the three qualities of juſtice, goodneſs and truth, which correſpond to the three perſons in the Trinity, and are always joyn'd inſeparably in all his works, whereof if one were wanting, his work would not be perfect. Even ſo meekneſs and lowlyneſs ſhould be imperfect if they were ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from humility of heart, which ſhould beget infallibly true meekneſs and lowlyneſs; for an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble heart is always meek and lowly.</p>
            <p>See, My Child, by that Touch-ſtone, if you are arrived at that humility of heart; and endeavour to obtain it of God, and then you ſhall aſſuredly be meek and lowly, which is the deſire of</p>

            <p>I Exhorted you by my laſt to <hi>Humility of Heart</hi>; but I know not if you underſtand well what that <hi>humility of heart</hi> is, wherein it conſiſts, and by what means you may diſcover if you have it, or not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore I have reſolved to ſpeak very particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to you, that you may diſcern in every thing true Virtue, from falſe and only apparent Virtue: and to lay in your ſoul a good foundation, of ſolid virtue: without amuſing you (as do now adays ſo many perſons of good-will) with apparent or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary virtues, which before God are of little or no value.</p>
            <p>You have now ſufficiently heard what is that <hi>meekneſs and lowlineſs,</hi> which Jeſus Chriſt teaches we <hi>muſt learn of him</hi>: Endeavour now to diſcover what is that <hi>Humility of Heart</hi> which he teaches in that ſame counſel: For I ſhall ſhow you particularly what it is, what need we have to poſſeſs it, and what profit it brings to our ſouls, that you want it not through ignorance. Humility then is the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and accompliſhment of all virtues, and ought to be eſteemed above others; and ſo we ought to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour more to attain it, than any other virtue; ſeeing it begets of it ſelf ſeveral others, and baniſhes ſeveral vices, which cannot abide in an humble heart; as Pride, Preſumption, Avarice, Pomps, and Vain Glory, and many other ſins, which proceed from Pride of Heart: but when it becomes humble, then are all theſe vices baniſht.</p>
            <p>And to know what that <hi>Humility of Heart</hi> is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65025:43"/>
you are to believe that it is <hi>a perfect knowledge of ones ſelf.</hi> For he that knows himſelf well, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be proud, nor have an eſteem of himſelf. He will not glory in the Praiſes and Honours of Men; He will not deſire Riches, to be adorned or ſerved; for an <hi>humble heart</hi> believes that it deſerves nothing, and the leaſt things content and ſatisfie it.</p>
            <p>An <hi>humble Heart</hi> is not in wrath for being abaſed or deſpiſed, becauſe he ſeeth in knowing himſelf, that he deſerves nothing, but is worthy of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. And whereas that is not practiſed among men, it is becauſe they know not themſelves, and ſo eſteem themſelves worthy of Eſteem, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Riches and ſervice: and that makes them Proud. For if they obſerved well whence they are, what they are, and what ſhall become of them; it were impoſſible that they ſhould in the leaſt eſteem themſelves; on the contrary, they would ſee that they deſerve all ſort of Contempt, becauſe they are, as to the Spirit, frail, ignorant, and unconſtant; and as to the body, full of Miſeries, Infirmities and Diſeaſes, liable to death and corruption.</p>
            <p>All theſe things ſhould not Give matter of exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelf to man's underſtanding, or to make him eſteem himſelf in any wiſe: but rather ground to humble and abaſe himſelf before God and Men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his infirmities and miſeries: and yet we ſee they make themſelves great, are arrogant, eſteem much of themſelves, and in fine, believe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves worthy of all ſorts of Honours, Pleaſures, Riches, and ſervices; every one advancing himſelf with all his power, all that proceeds from thence, that men know not themſelves; for if they did, they would be aſhamed to glory in their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, folly and ignorance: For man hath nothing elſe in himſelf; and all theſe defaults are annexed
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65025:44"/>
to his corrupt nature. If you open but the eyes of your underſtanding, you ſhall ſee abundantly the miſeries of your ſpirit, and how it is agitated by divers motions and intemperate paſſions.</p>
            <p>Alſo, as ſoon as you open the eyes of the body, you ſee the bodily miſeries under which all men lye: and if you reflect whence the body of man proceeds, and of what ſubſtance it is formed, you ſhall find that he proceeds of an unclean and putrid matter, and from thoſe members of his parents bodys which are the moſt ſhameful. And thence he hath no ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to glory or eſteem himſelf in his origin, ſeeing it is from ſo vile and baſe things, which ought to give him occaſion of confuſion and humility. And even beaſts have more eſtimable qualities than men as to the body. For he would preſently be ſtifled in the filth accompanying his nativity, if he were not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by the aſſiſtance of others; and he would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſtarve with hunger and other neceſſities, if care were not taken to ſuſtain him: whereas the beaſts can help themſelves ſo ſoon as they come into the world.</p>
            <p>And if man will look forward into his life, he ſhall find that it is but a maſs of miſeries, linked one to another: What feebleneſs is in man's body? He can endure neither too much heat nor too much cold, a little over, in exerciſe, and he is wearied; he muſt reſt and ſleep, or he looſes his ſtrength and health; he muſt be cloathed and alimented, clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and cheriſhed; whereby his underſtanding is occupied in care, travail and diſquiet all the days of his life to relieve the infirmities of his body.

paſſions; as of Fear, Terror, Sadneſs, Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Anger, Jealouſie, and ſuch other ſorts of evils, to which man is ſubject during this miſerable life! where he hath no ſubject of glorying and eſteeming himſelf; but great reaſon to abaſe himſelf in the view of ſo many miſeries to which his ſin hath reduced him: which gives him good cauſe of ſubmiſſion and humility before God and Men; feeling himſelf mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable and infirm both in ſoul and body: for the Spirit hath its diſeaſes as well as the body; for do but take heed to yourſelf, and you ſhall find your ſpirit agitated by various ſuperfluous deſires, and uſeleſs thoughts which carry it away often againſt its inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the Apoſtle teſtifies, that <hi>it is not in the power of man to order his thoughts</hi>: which every one may feel. For when we would fix our heart on prayer, or other good exerciſe, it wavers here, and there, that we cannot retain it. So that we may truly ſay, that it is not in man's power to contain his thoughts: So infirm is his Spirit, that his Reaſon hath not the force to ſtay the courſe of his thoughts; which often ſway the reaſon whither it would not. So that man's Spirit is captivated under the tiranny of his diſordered paſſions, which often lead him into great evils, even contrary to his will: whereof the Apoſtle ſays: <hi>I approve not what I do, becauſe what I would not, that I do; and what I would, that I do not</hi>: To prove how many evils the ſpirit of man is ſubject, as well as his body; and that there is no ſubject of glorying in the one or th'other; ſeeing they are equally infirm and miſerable, changeable and inconſtant.</p>
            <p>For what mutations feel we not in our ſpirit? the variety and changing in one day, of Joy, Sadneſs, Hopes, Diſpleaſures and Deſires are ſcarce numera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; how many diverſe thoughts? we love at one time, what we hate at another; what we deſire
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65025:45"/>
one day, diſſatisfies us another: ſo that we know not our ſelves ſometimes what we would be at; and are often afflicted for having what we had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired.</p>
            <p>And if one ſhould write all the thoughts and deſires which paſs in the ſpirit of a man, himſelf would be aſhamed of his inconſtancy and inſtability, and would be far from haughtineſs for the qualities of his ſpirit, no more than for thoſe of his body; but would ſee ground of humility for his miſeries: for there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can elevate the heart of man in an eſteem of himſelf, but a blaſt of wind, which the Devil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires into his ſpirit, to precipitate him into the ſin of Pride by ſottiſh imaginations, which proceed from that air (which is in effect nothing) wherewith he is filled: For even all the ſciences of man's underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding are but figures formed of that wind; as we ſee figures in the air by the Clouds, appearing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times as if we ſaw Mountains moving, or Houſes, and Armies, all which notwithſtanding are but Clouds agitated by the wind, and repreſenting ſuch figures to our eyes.</p>
            <p>It is even ſo with mens Sciences, who fancy themſelves wiſe, when they are very ignorant. For I do not believe that they have yet truly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered one ſcience, even natural; and how can they then in myſtical (or ſpiritual) things? That is what Jeſus Chriſt ſaid to his diſciples, <hi>He that ſeeth me, ſeeth my father; but you know neither me nor the father.</hi> Notwithſtanding we will often ſearch cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly the profound Myſteries and divine Secrets; and we know not natural things, which we ſee and handle. One will vaunt in being a Doctor of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, another in Theology, another will be an Aſtronomer, and ſo of other ſciences; although
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65025:45"/>
they be all alike ignorant of what they profeſs, and think they know well. And that proceeds from that airy Pride which the Devil hath inſpired in to their Spirit; perſwading them, that they are wiſe, and worthy of honour and eſteem; though they be in effect ignorant and worthy of contempt.</p>
            <p>We ſee that Phyſicians eſteem themſelves wiſe, becauſe they have read Medicinal Authors; and theſe Authors are often as ignorant as they that read and follow them: becauſe all they have written is but vaniſhing figures, which waver in the air of their imaginations; and what the ancients have written, is followed by their poſterity: And ſo they think to cure the ſick by remedies coined in the air of mans imagination; who ſeem to have divers Sciences and Remedies, while they do but gueſs and hazard the lives of the ſick: and I believe the Phyſicians have killed many more than they've cured (to reckon the moſt common and ordinary) and that becauſe they have not diſcovered the Secrets of Nature, and know not the conſtitution of man's body, nor the origin of his diſeaſes; and conſequently cannot exhibit proper remedies for them; but often give what proves poiſon, to kill men, inſtead of curing them.</p>
            <p>And therefore there is no ſubject of glorying for being called a Doctor in Medicine: but rather of abaſement and confuſion for their great ignorance to the hurt of the Patient they take care of. And as that ignorance is great, in regard of bodily medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine; it is yet greater in regard of the ſpiritual; which is Theology; for it kills many more ſouls than medicine does bodies: and ſo th'one hath not ſubject of glorying of his skill, more than th'other; being they are equally ignorant, which do not add nor pare the one from the other, having each great ground of humility.</p>

            <p>YOu have ſeen by my laſt, what <hi>Humility</hi> is; where I have ſhown you, that it conſiſts in the knowledge of our ſelves; and that no perſon can ever be proud, but for lack of knowing himſelf; for in knowing themſelves, they will find ſubject enough to humble themſelves, by ſeeing their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities and miſeries both of ſoul and body: for he who will reflect ſeriouſly upon himſelf, he ſhall not only diſcover his own nothingneſs; but will judge himſelf much worſe than nothing; and conſequently will be far from eſteeming and magnifying himſelf, unleſs he be altogether a fool, and void of all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and underſtanding. For if he judge by an upright judgment, what he is, he ſhall ſee nothing but miſery and infirmities in his nature, and ignorance and Diſorder in his ſpirit; for a Beaſt knows more than he, for the conduct of its life; and is more moderate in eating and drinking, and other natural things, than man: and we ſee him frequently exceed in theſe things, which Beaſts do not. Thence is it that man is much more ſubject to diſeaſes than the Beaſts, becauſe they commit more exceſſes and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperances, than they.</p>
            <p>And when man finds himſelf more diſorderly and fooliſh in the conduct of his life than the Beaſts, ought he not to humble himſelf before God and men, as worthy of all confuſion? ſeeing God hath given him a Spirit, more perfect than any Beaſt; and yet he knows not to apply it to rule his paſſions and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, which often cauſes to him great evils, and ſometimes death. Which ought to be a great ſubject
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65025:47"/>
of humility and Contempt of himſelf: he can never, knowing that, magnify and eſteem himſelf; if it is not becauſe he is void of judgment and reaſon; which he looſes as ſoon as he gives entry to the vanities which the devil inſpires into his ſpirit to eſteem himſelf.</p>
            <p>Then he goes from one error to another, becauſe fallen from the Light of the Truth, and knows no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but falſhood, which that evil Spirit makes him believe, and inſpires into his Spirit, that he is worthy of Honour for his Wiſdom, or Riches, or Virtue; though he be contemptible even in all theſe very reſpects. For his Wiſdom is but folly before God; and his riches are but weighty charges, painful to be born, and cauſe trouble and diſquiet to preſerve them; and his Virtue cannot be other than feigned, ſeeing it is not founded on the knowledge of his nothingneſs, and truth of his miſeries.</p>
            <p>And Therefore vain-glory and eſteem of our ſelves can never be other than meer folly, which Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan inſpires and foiſts into mens ſpirits: ſeeing there is in them nothing eſteemable, as to the corrupted nature; but aboundance of miſeries worthy of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and Scorn.</p>
            <p>So that we may truly call a proud man a very Fool, becauſe he glories of his Miſeries, and jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges his Ignorance, Wiſdom, and his Troubles, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, For ſuch are temporal Riches, which create continual troubles and diſquiet, with a thouſand cares both to acquire them and to conſerve them.</p>
            <p>Some of the <hi>Pagans</hi> having diſcover'd that, threw all their Gold and Money into the ſea, to be freed from the care and diſquiet of keeping it, and live with liberty of Spirit.</p>
            <p>Which ſhould confound the <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> who em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys all the force of his body and induſtry of his
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:65025:47"/>
mind, to acquire Riches, ſo burthenſom to have and troubleſome to keep: when the <hi>Pagans</hi> by the Light of nature have had them in contempt, and thrown them from them, which they did becauſe they had a true knowledge of themſelves and of natural things. And thence alſo did they deſpiſe the Honours and Pleaſures of this life; and ſeeing them ſo miſerable, and of ſo ſhort continuance, one counted it not worth the pains to build a Houſe to lodge in, being content with a barrel to defend him from Sun and Rain: Another ſeeing that he could conveniently enough carry Water into his Mouth in the hollow of his Hand, would no more uſe a Cup. So firmly have theſe <hi>Pagans</hi> deſpiſed this preſent life, that they would not take any pleaſure therein, nor uſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted things but for urgent neceſſity, and the leaſt that might be, rejecting what's more.</p>
            <p>And ſo they did, becauſe they knew that all the pleaſures and Honours of this World are vain, falſe and deceitful; that they might obtain true ones, which are eternal; they longed therefore to be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from this miſerable life, which they eſteemed a Priſon, a Valley of Tears, as in truth it is.</p>
            <p>But men now adays diſcover not that: they eſteem themſelves happy in their Miſeries, and rich in their Poverty; they delight in their Chains and Bonds by blindneſs of ſpirit, and for want of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves, and the things they ſo priſe; and ſo they eſteem him happy who can take his pleaſure in eating and drinking, recreations, and other carnal ſatisfactions. Yet ſuch are abundantly more miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than thoſe that live ſoberly and chaſtly, and in poverty: He that can content himſelf with little, hath no need of much, and is more joyful in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiredneſs of ſpirit, than if he were in the midſt of pleaſant and divertiſing company.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:65025:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>Beſide, he needs not uſe much labour or trafique to gain money: Alſo he that lives ſoberly is better content with his courſe fare, than they that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their appetites, which are inſatiable by all their Dainties. And he that lives chaſtly, keeps his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the repoſe of his Conſcience. And he that does not delight in company and divertiſments, does not fear diſpleaſing men, nor ſtudies anxiouſly to be acceptable to them, as others who take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in them. They muſt be cloathed, and behave themſelves after the faſhion of the World; and for that they muſt gain money, that they may be well treated as others; which requires a continual care to provide all, that nothing be wanting, that they may appear like others; and that is a ſlavery from which we cannot be delivered, but by quitting the World.</p>
            <p>For he that will pleaſe the World, hath loſt his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberty, and cannot ſerve himſelf: He is as a hired Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, ſubjected to all ſorts of Vanities, to the great ones and wiſe ones of the world; whom he fears and reſpects more than God himſelf: and withal, that they reckon themſelves happy to be ſo engaged and bound to the World and its vanities, to which they willingly yield themſelves Slaves. For if they would retain their liberty, they would diſengage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from theſe human regards, and withdraw from worldly creatures, without yielding their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to be bewitched, in thinking its Slavery to be a Liberty, and its Fetters to be Chains of Gold for Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament; which is meer falſhood and vanity: for, to ſerve God only, is to reign; and to ſerve the World, is to be a Slave.</p>
            <p>Which theſe wiſe <hi>Pagans</hi> knew well, and therefore contemned the World and its honours and pleaſures. Yea ſome of them cared not to be viſited by Kings
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:65025:48"/>
and Emperors; ſo that one of them deſired, and bid a King that came to viſit him, <hi>Stand by, and be gone,</hi> complaining, <hi>That he kept from him what he could not give,</hi> namely, by interrupting from him the Sun-ſhine, which he eſteemed more valuable than all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the World.</p>
            <p>For which they had good reaſon; for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Charges afford alſo the greateſt Troubles; and he that is over others, is ſervant of all; for he muſt take care of them, and rule and govern them as he will anſwer to God; which may diſquiet and vex him all the days of his life, and puts in hazard his eternal Salvation. For he muſt not only reckon for himſelf, but alſo for all that have been under him, and bear for and with them the puniſhment of all that they have done amiſs; by order, ſufferance, or for want of inſtruction, and correction, according to the juſtice of God.</p>
            <p>Therefore is it that a Superior is more miſerable than another, in time and in eternity, which we may obſerve even in the Maſter of a Family, who muſt take care, and travail to entertain his Wife; Children and ſervants, while they are often without care, knowing that their Maſter muſt feed and cloath them in due time, that they want nothing: in which they are much happier than their Maſters; for they have only one ſervice to perform, and their maſter is burthened with ſeveral.</p>
            <p>Yet ſuch is the blindneſs of men, that every one deſires Charges, Eſtates, Superiorities and Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, which they could not deſire, if it were not by an air of pride, which the Devil hath inſpired into their minds, otherways it were impoſſible that men ſhould ſeek after Charges, but do their utmoſt to evite them. As ſeveral Saints have done formerly, ſome leſt they ſhould be obliged to undertake
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:65025:49"/>
the charge of Biſhops that was offered to them, reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red privately to evite it; and even one of the Popes, conſidering the heavy burthen of his Charge, exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his Popedom for a Deſart. So afflicting are Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Superiorities for them that have attained to know the truth of things; and their own miſery and frailty: and ſo they have contemned them, and thought it enough to ſee to themſelves, and deſired not a Poſterity to ſucceed to their Miſeries, which they knew too well to deſire them for their Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. They loved rather to live chaſtly, than to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create Children ſo miſerable as themſelves. In which they were very wiſe, being we ſee that in effect men wax worſe every day, and the Children are worſe than their Fathers, and Childrens Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren yet worſe, becauſe of the great corruption that is now among men, which augments even viſibly.</p>
            <p>So that he that knows the Truth, will be loath to multiply this perverſe Generation, but will expect that men reſume a true Chriſtian Life, and ſo may multiply in the ſpirit of Jeſus Chriſt a holy Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>Lo, what they that are wiſe deſire, but the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant think it a happineſs to produce Children Heirs of their Miſeries, becauſe themſelves do not know them; and ſo glory in their ſhame, without perceiving it: they would willingly be great and rich, that they may have Means to pleaſe their Senſes; and theſe Pleaſures ruin Soul and Body.</p>
            <p>For ſince Nature was corrupted by ſin, all the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of man are become brutiſh and inſolent, and know no more what is good or evil for them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate, without order or meaſure; and therefore the Scripture ſays, that <hi>the Eye is never ſatisfied with ſeeing, nor the Ear with hearing</hi>; to ſhow how our
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:65025:49"/>
ſenſes are diſordered and inſatiable: the more the eye ſees, the more it would ſee, and ſo the ear hear, and they are never ſatisfied. It is the ſame with the Feeling, Smelling and Taſte, the other three ſenſes.</p>
            <p>For whenever a man gives himſelf to <hi>ſatisfie</hi> his ſenſes, he is never fully <hi>ſatisfied</hi> nor content: For in every place he may find ſomething that ſmells un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſantly; and though he carry about Musk and Civet, that will not hinder that he breath not in the bad Exhalations and Vapours of the Air, cauſed by the corruption and filth of the bodies of Men and Beaſts, although he had but the ſtink of his own body, ſince all that proceeds out of it is naſty and putrid, which cannot ſatisfie his ſmell, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires always good ſmells and agreeable; and in loving that, we can never be content nor <hi>ſatisfied.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet leſs can we <hi>ſatisfie</hi> the ſenſe of feeling, it being inſatiable. They would have fine Linnen, Silks, ſoft Beds, ſmooth Coverings, and other things agreeable to the touch, which is not content with things that are ſufficient.</p>
            <p>But the ſenſe of Taſte exceeds all the others in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order and intemperance. For he that will <hi>ſatisfie</hi> his taſte and delicacy, renders himſelf miſerable, and in continual diſſatisfaction: For when he hath one food that is good, he deſires another as better; the Wine is too ſharp or ſtale for him, the Beer is too ſweet for his delicate taſte: he longs always for what he hath not, and what he cannot get: ſo inſolent are mans natural ſenſes, that they often tyrannize over the ſpirit with a thouſand tortures of Deſires, Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perances, Luſts, Exceſs and Gluttony, which bring Diſeaſes, Poverty and Death. And yet they call him happy who hath the means to ſatisfie his ſenſes, without diſcovering that they are corrupted by ſin,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:65025:50"/>
and therefore they beget all ſorts of Evils; which ſhe prays you to diſcover, who wiſheth your good.</p>

            <p>I Cannot entertain you too much of the Corruption of man, and the Miſeries to which he is ſubject during this miſerable life, to prevent your ever pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing your affections on it; but that you may <hi>learn the Humility of Heart</hi> which Jeſus Chriſt teaches, which will follow upon the knowledge of your ſelf: but you ſhall never attain it unleſs you examin in retail the miſeries and infirmities of your body and ſpirit, ſince it is that knowledge which ſhould teach you the <hi>Humility of Heart</hi> which Jeſus Chriſt requires.</p>
            <p>For if you remain in the general ignorance of men, you ſhall never attain to it: you will always think you deſerve Honour and Eſteem, ſeeing others like your ſelf honoured and eſteemed; and that they alſo take their pleaſures and ſenſualities, more than you do. But truſt me (my Dear Child) that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:65025:50"/>
proceeds from the blindneſs of their minds, and from the profound darkneſs in which they are, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out perceiving it: and they blind one another ſtill more by their practice; for one thinks he is as good as the other, and that he may do what another doth; and ſo one follows another blindfoldly, and thinks he doth but what is ſuitable for an honeſt man to do.</p>
            <p>But however great the number of blind are, that will not help you in particular; and that broad way will always lead to perdition, tho many tread it. The great number of miſerables will not leſſen your condemnation; on the contrary, it will augment your pains and miſeries, far from any ways mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them.</p>
            <p>Therefore is it that you muſt not regard if others be blind, and know not themſelves, eſteeming themſelves, and following their ſenſualities; for you ſhall not give an accompt for them. There ſhall only your own works follow you at Death, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to them ſhall you be judged. God affords you now the occaſion of Diſcovering the truth of all things; beware of neglecting it; but bleſs the Lord; for it is a great mercy he ſhows you beyond ſo many thouſands of perſons, who periſh for want of knowing themſelves, and for having never diſcovered the truth of things as they are before God. They amuſe themſelves to look one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, without penetrating into the ſtate of man, and what he is, whence he is, and whither he tends; though it is a thing of ſo great import, on which our eternal ſalvation depends.</p>
            <p>Therefore I exhort you to lay to heart the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of your ſelf, ſeeing that muſt rule all your actions, and make you become humble of heart, as Jeſus Chriſt teaches us to be. <hi>The truth of all</hi>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:65025:51"/>
               <hi>things ſhould deliver you from all evil</hi>; that is alſo the miſtreſs of virtues; for if you poſſeſs the Truth of God, that ſhall teach you all virtues, and deliver you from all vice: for the cauſe why man is vicious, and not virtuous, is becauſe he knows not the truth of things; and takes the Shadow for the Body, the Bark for the Wood; and ſo goes from evil to worſe.</p>
            <p>For if he knew truly what ſin is, and what vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, he would deliver himſelf from the one to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the other: ſince he would ſee clearly that ſin is a meer Tyrant, which tortures Soul and Body; and that virtue is beautiful, good, ſweet, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant. And ſo he could not retain himſelf from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſin, and loving virtue, ſeeing that is good and equitable; but for lack of knowledge of things, they love what they ſhould hate, and hate what is lovely: and to ſhow you what ſin is, know, that in it ſelf it is nothing but a diſorder of corrupted nature.</p>
            <p>For when God created man, he was well ordered, temperate and regular in all his natural functions: and he might enjoy the pleaſure of all his ſenſes without doing evil; becauſe all that God made was good; and he created beautiful things to pleaſe his ſight, and all the melodies of Beaſts, Men, and all melodious things to afford pleaſure to the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and all Flowers and pleaſant ſmells for his ſmelling; and all ſmooth and agreeable things for his feeling; and all good and ſavory things to afford pleaſure to his Taſte: ſo that he could allowably enjoy the Pleaſures of all his five natural ſenſes; becauſe all the other Creatures were created for the pleaſure and recreation of Man; who was ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, that he uſed all theſe things only for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation, with juſt order, weight and meaſure;
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:65025:51"/>
in praiſing his and their God: and in that ſtate he could not be diſagreeable to him.</p>
            <p>But after that he would abandon his dependance on God, and become wiſe in himſelf; he hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned all that beautiful order eſtabliſh't by God; and hath brought into his nature all ſorts of evil, diſorder and corruption; and that is called ſin: which is nothing elſe but a diſorder of the five ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which man can no more ſatisfie without ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, they being corrupted and diſordered: for if the eye pleaſe it ſelf now in looking on beautiful and pleaſant things, it is only to ſatisfie it ſelf; and not to refer them to God their Author, as he did before ſin: and if he hears melodious Sounds and Harmonies, it is only to delight and recreate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and that in this valley of miſeries, where he ought rather to mourn in embracing the chaſtiſements of God becauſe of ſin: and if he will <hi>ſatisfie</hi> his Smell by good odours, it is to repel the putridity which ſin hath brought upon nature: and if he will <hi>ſatisfie</hi> his Feeling, it is but to defile his Soul by unlawful pleaſures, which he takes in feeling; for it is not allowable for him to take pleaſure in any of his ſenſes after by ſin he hath overturned the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which God eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>And if he will ſatisfie his Taſte, he will fall into all ſorts of evils; for giving up himſelf to his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, that brings Intemperance, Gluttony, Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Sickneſs, and Death; as alſo Avarice, Deceit, Riot, and other Sins; which proceed from the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in Taſte, which is as a Mother, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genders all ſorts of evil. For a glutton muſt needs covet Riches to ſatisfie his appetite; and if he hath them not of his own, he endeavours to get them by any means he can, if it ſhould be Falſehood or Robbery. For the Taſte is inſatiable, and is
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:65025:52"/>
not content with a few things. I have known per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons addicted to the pleaſure of Taſte, who ſpent upon dainties great Riches which they poſſeſſed: and yet were never content, but continually deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red what they had not; and having gotten what they deſired, perhaps would not taſte it; but ſend again to ſeek ſome other thing; and ſo conſumed and ended their life in poverty, and without ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.</p>
            <p>I have known others, that would come that length to take the goods of others, to ſatisfie their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacies; and ſaid to me, <hi>That their Tongues could not be deprived of the pleaſures of Taſte, and they muſt needs ſatisfie it.</hi> I ſuppoſe there are more ſuch, though not known by me; for the appetite of Taſte is ſo bound up with the fleſh, that it is hardly overcome, having once got entrance, and being accuſtomed to pleaſe their taſte. And this pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Taſte begets Luſt alſo, by the affinity of the Belly with the genital parts, which are ſtimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted according as the Belly is well pack't. Moreover, the Appetite breeds Gluttony; for when it find's food agreeable, it devours to exceſs and intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; which cauſes ſeveral diſeaſes, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Death.</p>
            <p>For we ſee by experience, that ſeveral have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſick, and even died, by too much eating or drinking, or gluttonouſly eating things contrary to their health; which falls out but too frequently.</p>
            <p>And notwithſtanding all this, we ſee ſo many follow this ſenſe of taſte, which begets ſo many evils in prejudice of ſoul and body, and that becauſe they know not the truth of things, and have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined a pleaſure and contentment, where there is nothing but diſpleaſure and miſeries. For if they knew truly what is in the five natural ſenſes of man,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:65025:52"/>
they would ſee nothing there but vanity and miſery, ſince they were corrupted by ſin: and conſequently would never follow them, but reſiſt them in every thing, ſeeing they are truly vain; which they may ſee that will examin them narrowly: for what is in the ſenſe of ſeeing, but a pleaſure which is paſt in a moment: If, for example, looking on a beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing, you ſhut your eyes, in that inſtant you ſee it no more, and in your regard, it is no more; and if after by opening your eyes, you ſee it again, that ſight adds nothing to your ſoul or body, which cannot be nourisht by ſights if you ſhould continue them from morning till evening; all that cannot nourish nor fill us, nor give any thing but an airy pleaſure to our eyes, which alſo will not be refresht by theſe ſights; for the more they ſee, the more they would ſee. Wherefore the Scripture ſays, <hi>The Eye is never wearied with ſeeing, nor the Ear with hearing</hi>; for theſe two ſenſes are inſatiable, and never ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; for the hearing is as vain as the ſight, and ſeems even of leſs conſideration; becauſe it hath leſs impreſſion upon the mind, and paſſes as a blaſt of wind which we neither ſee nor feel more when it is gone. It is even ſo with Harmony and Sounds; for it is but a body of wind formed in the air, and diſſipated in it, and leaves nothing in him that hath heard it. No more does alſo the ſenſe of Smell, yielding only a ſmall ſatisfaction to the Noſtrils, and flys away with the wind, without leaving any thing in him that felt it, who is as ready to be filled again with ſtink as he was with perfume.</p>
            <p>So that we may ſee by experience, that the five ſenſes are truly vain and unworthy to be followed and affected by perſons of judgment, and that would come to the knowledge of the truth: for one muſt be a fool and blind to place his affections in things
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:65025:53"/>
ſo unworthy of man, as are the pleaſures of his ſenſes, which paſs like ſmoak; and cauſe ſo great evils to them that follow them, both ſpiritual and temporal: for he that will give his ſenſes their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, wounds body and ſoul, and renders himſelf miſerable in all his life; for he cannot have ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and compleat contentment by all the world; and he waſts his goods to pleaſe his ſenſes; woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his health by intemperance, and killing his ſoul by ſin; which is the diſorder of his natural ſenſes. For ſince they were corrupted, they have engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred death, bodily and ſpiritually in man, who cannot love his ſenſualities without turning away from God, and conſequently deprive themſelves of all good, and ſubject themſelves to all ſorts of evil; for there can be no good without God, but all ſorts of evil.</p>
            <p>And it is that (my Child) which I entreat you to conſider, that you may never place your affections but in God; and may renounce your ſenſes, ſeeing they are corrupted, and contrary to the will of God, and in themſelves evil and vanity. For what is in feeling but a ſenſual ſoftneſs, which adds nothing to man, and is ſo mean and unworthy of a man, that he would never ſeek pleaſure therein if the devil did not perſwade him that there is ſomething in it; it is ſo frail and contemptible, that it is not worthy a man's notice, or that he ſhould account it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſince it is but imaginary, not real.</p>
            <p>The ſenſe of taſte ſeems to have ſome pleaſure in it, ſeeing there are perſons that have no greater plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the world than to eat and drink well; and that ſenſe adds ſomewhat to mans body: Yet it is more repleniſht with miſeries than the other four, becauſe it hurts more both the ſoul and body of man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeeing it cauſes ſo many diſeaſes, and even death, by its exceſſes; and alſo, ſo many ſouls damn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:65025:53"/>

For what is more naughty than meat and drink? They have ſcarce paſt the throat but they become putrid and corrupt, and eſpecially the more fine and delicate corrupt more than the courſer.</p>
            <p>And for all that people love them, beſtowing pains and travail to attain them; which is a groſs blindneſs of mind; from which I pray God preſerve you, that your love may remain in God only, and you may know the truth of all ſalutary things; in the deſire whereof I remain</p>

            <head>THE VII. LETTER. He that ſerves the Luſts of his Senſes, by that ſame Renounces the Love of God.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>To the ſame, exhorting him to the effects of Humility, by the Renouncing of his ſenſes; ſhowing him, that no man can follow them, unleſs thereby he renounce the Love of God, which is the end of our Creation, and the eſſence of true Virtue.</p>
            </argument>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Dear Child;</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Deduced to you in my laſt, how vain and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable are the Pleaſures of the Senſes; and have
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:65025:54"/>
ſhewed you the truth of ſeveral things, that you might arrive to the Humility of heart which Jeſus Chriſt requires. It is much to underſtand well theſe things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but alſo you muſt ſet about the practice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and embrace in good earneſt the mortification of your ſenſes, following the truths you have known: otherways its a ſmall matter to know the Truth, if you put it not in practice: knowledge is very good: for you cannot practiſe what you know not: but if that knowledge be not fruitful, it cannot ſerve for our Salvation. We muſt needs put to our hand, and war againſt our corrupt nature; otherways we muſt die the eternal Death after the temporal.</p>
            <p>Which may eaſily be conceived, ſince mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is corrupted by <hi>Adams</hi> ſin; and hath quitted dependance on God, to depend of it ſelf. It muſt then of neceſſity remain in that corruption and ſin, until every man for his own particular have overcome that corruption and diſobedience which he hath contracted againſt God: or elſe he abideth in death, and dies damned eternally.</p>
            <p>For although <hi>Adam</hi> had not ſinned, all men in general and every one in particular, could have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and corrupted his way, by leaving dependance on his God; and that becauſe, all the men that were, or ſhall be, are all created free, and can continue in the dependance of God, and alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede from it, if they pleaſe: for God forces no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. So that he that is arrived to the uſe of Reaſon, hath the ſame liberty to ſin, and retire from depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on God, that <hi>Adam</hi> had before his ſin: yet with this difference, that <hi>Adam</hi> at the beginning had not in his nature that frailty and inclination to ſin and evil which men have; who proceeded from him after his ſin: for they have contracted that frailty and inclination to evil from their firſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:65025:54"/>
and alſo the infirmities of body which we ſee in all men, and feel in our ſelves; for no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is exempt from the evils which ſin hath cauſed in man's nature: Though it is free to all men to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that inclination to evil, which they feel in themſelves; as alſo, they can, by the Grace of God, overcome their infirmities, and the corruption of their five ſenſes; in not following them, but figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againſt them.</p>
            <p>And it is in that, that Jeſus Chriſt ſays, we muſt <hi>take the Kingdom of Heaven by Force, and the Violent take it ſo:</hi> That is, not that we ſhould fight by force to gain the Kingdom; for God created it for us, and he gives it us freely: but it is, that we muſt reſiſt with force the corruption of our nature, that we may enter into the Kingdom of Heaven: and ſo that we approve not in us, the ſin which <hi>Adam</hi> committed, and do not of our own proper will retire from dependance on God.</p>
            <p>Therefore it is the Scripture ſays, <hi>Our Life is a continual Warfare</hi>: For we muſt continually combat the corruption of our ſenſes; without that, we can never return to dependance on God, from which <hi>Adam's</hi> ſin hath withdrawn us; ſeeing our ſenſes (being corrupted) beget all ſorts of evil; and there needs no more but to follow them, and their incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to turn us away from God, and remain in the way of damnation.</p>
            <p>For no ſooner looſe we the reins to our Sight, but it pleaſes it ſelf to behold beautiful or curious things; and no ſooner have we conſidered them, but we covet them. And if we yield to the ſenſe of Hearing, the Heart delights in it, and the Affection is drawn to it. It is even ſo with Smelling, where the ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive part takes pleaſure. And if we pleaſe our ſelves in Taſte, all our care and ſtudy are put to ſearch
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:65025:55"/>
means to ſatisfie it and that ſenſe is more inſatiable than any other, and precipitates into all ſorts of ſins. Moreover, it excites the ſenſe of feeling; for he that pleaſes his taſte, ſeeks alſo to ſatisfie his feeling with pleaſure and ſatisfaction. Even all the five ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are moved only by the love we carry to our ſelves, and deſire of affording our ſelves pleaſure.</p>
            <p>All theſe things with-draw us aſſuredly from God, and dependance on him; and he hath commanded us, <hi>to love him with all our heart.</hi> So that he wills not that we fix our heart on things ſo frail and vile, as are the Sight, Hearing, Smelling Taſte, and Feeling: For it is unworthy of a divine Soul, which God hath given us, capable of loving an eternal God, who deſires and commands that we love him with all our heart. So that the man that hath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for his ſenſes, quits voluntarily the depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of God, ſeeing he does not ſubmit himſelf to his will, who demands that, we ſhould love him with all our heart.</p>
            <p>And that is, from the diſorder which the devil hath cauſed in man's nature, when he made it turn the affection upon the creatures, which is due to God alone. In which conſiſted the firſt ſin which man committed, and thence all other ſins draw their origin. For nothing can be evil or ſin, but what is committed againſt the will of God: and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but that can be evil, as nothing can be good but what is done by his will.</p>
            <p>So the Devil laboured violently from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world to pervert man from the will of God, who had created him to delight himſelf with him, and willed for that, that he ſhould love him with all his heart. There cannot be delight but with what is beloved; and therefore will God be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of man with all his heart; and that he place his
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:65025:55"/>
affections in nothing elſe but in him only. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil no ſooner perceived that, but he enticed him by the five natural ſenſes (which are as the five win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of our heart) to withdraw his heart and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections from God, and to place them on viſible and ſenſible things.</p>
            <p>The Devil then firſt moved <hi>Adam's</hi> heart to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the beautiful Creatures, which God had crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for him; he moved alſo his ſenſe of hearing, to give attention to the falſe perſwaſions of that old Serpent; who made him believe, that he ſhould know Good and Evil, if he did eat the fruit of the Tree which God had forbid him to eat of. He moved him to put his Hand to touch that Apple, his Smelling to ſmell it, and his Taſte to eat it: and by that means the Devil carryed <hi>Adam's</hi> Heart and affection to the Creatures, and turned him away from the Love he owed to God.</p>
            <p>If the Devil could have drawn man's Heart di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to love him, he had done it: but becauſe he is an inviſible ſpirit, he could not move the five na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Senſes of man to love him. And therefore he ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved himſelf of viſible and ſenſible creatures, to get himſelf indirectly loved by man; that by moving man to ſelf-love, and to uſe all the other Creatures to ſatisfie his ſelf-love, and conſequently withdraw him from the love of God, which he hath done with too much ſucceſs, ſeeing he hath cauſed <hi>Adam,</hi> and all that were to proceed from him, to diſobey againſt God: and ſo made him abandon that depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, that he would no more depend but upon his own will, and love nothing but himſelf.</p>
            <p>Behold the miſerable fall into which the Devil cauſed all men to fall into in <hi>Adam</hi>: And they all in general are born in that miſery and diſobedience ſince the fall of <hi>Adam</hi>; and come into the world
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:65025:56"/>
with that evil inclination to love themſelves, and follow the corruption of their ſenſes, which breeds all ſorts of ſins, becauſe they are now moved by an evil ſpirit, which is the Devil; whence no good can proceed: for the privation of all good is the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of all evil. So that he that hath rejected the love of God, and would not renounce himſelf, hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived himſelf of all ſort of good, ſeeing there is no other good but God; and is fallen into all ſorts of evil, that is to ſay, into the privation of all ſorts of Good.</p>
            <p>God never created any evil, but man produced it when he deprived himſelf of the Love of God, in which alone conſiſts all ſorts of Good. And that is the thing they call ſin, which ſignifies to turn away, and deſert God, who is all good; and in the privation of him is all evil. So that he that hath withdrawn his affections from God, to place them in the love of himſelf, or of any other creature, hath abandoned all Good, and embraced all ſorts of Evil. For there can be no other evil but the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of all good; into which man engages him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when he carrys his love and affections to any thing elſe than God. And what <hi>Adam</hi> did once by the inſtigation of the Devil, men do it for their own particular as often as they ſet their affections on any thing beſide God only.</p>
            <p>Obſerve a little, my Child, how often you have fallen into the ſame ſin with <hi>Adam,</hi> and loved any other thing than God alone: and alſo, if you are not actually addicted to your ſelf-love, and reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the love of your God: but I am not ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at it, becauſe you never knew that ſin conſiſted in that, and no perſon hath taught you it: for the men of this time are ignorant of that truth, as well as you; and they that are eſteemed the moſt
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:65025:56"/>
virtuous, are full of ſelf-love, though they think themſelves free from ſin, ſo far does the heart of man deceive it ſelf.</p>
            <p>But for your part, be wiſer; for though all men ſhould go to perdition, you muſt endeavour to ſave your own Soul. The great number of damned would not diminiſh your torments if you ſhould be damned with them, but rather augment them, by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gmentation of crys, blaſphemies, and noyſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Fire and Brimſtone, which ſhall augment in Hell with proportion to the number of damned. And therefore I counſel you to leave that common tract of the blindneſs of men, which eſteem no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſin, but the material things which they have preſcribed one to another to be evil. Things which God regards little, ſeeing he is a pure Spirit, whom not only theſe groſs material things offend, as they decifer ſins; as Drunkenneſs, Robbery, Whoredom and other material ſins, blameable before men: but God is offended to ſee the heart of man cleave to and love things ſo vile; ſince he created him to love his God only, who will delight himſelf with him: And yet man deſerts God to delight himſelf in the ſatisfaction he takes in eating, drinking and cloathing, and recreation with any other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>Which hugely diſpleaſes God, and man becomes his enemy by diſobedience, while he acts againſt the deſigns God had in creating him after his own image and likeneſs, to take his delights with him: notwithſtanding man, againſt the intention of God, delights in himſelf, and the Creatures that are leſs than himſelf. For whatſoever is created under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, is much below man, who is as the head and principal of all the works of God, and was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed over all the other inferiour works of God;
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:65025:57"/>
being made as a little God in his divine nature, which is encloſed in his Humanity.</p>
            <p>But the Devil, envious of his happineſs, from the inſtant of his creation, ſtrove to make him loſe that part of the divinity which God had beſtowed on him, he rendered him ſenſual and earthly, to make him leave the love of divine and heavenly things, which alone he ought to have loved; and by that means he had enjoyed all the other creatures at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; as maſter and Lord of all that was ſubjected to him. But the proud Devil could not ſuffer man in dominion over the other Creatures, he being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected and baniſht from the friendſhip of God, depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of all good, and repleniſht of all evil; ſo he by Rage and Envy attempted to deſtroy man with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and make him companion of his miſeries: and ſeeing man compoſed of a body and a ſpirit, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuated into his ſpirit, endeavouring to unite himſelf with him, under pretext of procuring good to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo made him imagin that he ſhould know all things as God, if he would eat the fruit God had forbid him to eat of; and theſe thoughts being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into <hi>Adam's</hi> ſpirit, gained his affection, and made him forget the Love and Obedience which he owed to God; beginning to love himſelf, and ſearch the means for his own ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>Now God had given man five natural Senſes, that he might prove all that God had created for him, provided he praiſed and thanked the Creator for ſo many good things: but he began to uſe his ſenſes to pleaſe himſelf, and attribute to himſelf the Favours and Graces God had beſtowed on him, as if they had been his own, and he the Soveraign, independent on God: for he pleaſed himſelf to ſee ſo many beautiful creatures, and attributed them to himſelf; and alſo to hear the pleaſant Melody
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:65025:57"/>
which God produced in nature, pleaſing himſelf in hearing them, without referring them to God; the ſame did he in ſmelling, taking his content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in all the good Odours which God had made to ſhow unto man his liberality; giving him not only the things neeful for the ſuſtenance of his being, but alſo Delectable things to procure him pleaſure: as are the objects of Sight, Hearing, and Smell; and man could well have ſubſiſted without the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of theſe; but God would oblige him to love him by exceſs of benefits: and ſo created ſo many good and beautiful Creatures, only for pleaſure to man, having created all ſorts of delicious fruits for his nouriſhment, and ſo many other creatures to ſatisfie his feeling; that he might lack nothing for ſuſtenance, and pleaſures, which he could uſe at pleaſure, provided he bleſſed the Lord who had made them for him.</p>
            <p>But ingrate man falls from that acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his God, and takes all his gifts for his proper ſatisfaction: and ſo he left the Love of God, and hath turned to love himſelf; which hath neceſſarily rendred him an enemy to God; for ſuch ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is inſupportable, though it were but commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by one man to another. For what man would be ſatisfied, to have deſired the friendſhip and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity of another, having with that aim beſtowed his goods on him in abandance, and procured him all ſorts of pleaſures and recreations, that he might faithfully keep friendſhip; if that ingrate Wretch forſook his Benefactor, to take his pleaſure in theſe ſame goods which he had ſo freely received; how much more then ſhould God reſent the ingratitude of man, while he places his love and affection in the things which God hath ſo liberally beſtowed on him, to oblige him to love him? and yet man
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:65025:58"/>
hath forſaken him, and pleaſes himſelf only in ſelf-love.</p>
            <p>That you ought to conſider well, My Child, that you render not your ſelf guilty before that great Majeſty, and Diſcover, if you be not obliged to embrace voluntarily, <hi>Adam's</hi> penitence; ſince you have fallen ſo often in the ſame ſin, in quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the love and Dependance of your God, to love your ſelf, and Depend on your proper will. So reſolve to renounce your five natural ſenſes, which are aſſuredly actuated by the devil: for ſince he got power over <hi>Adam's</hi> ſpirit, he hath after had it over that of all men; and will have it ſo long as they continue to live in their corrupt nature: from which I pray God Deliver you, and I remain forever</p>

               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:65025:58"/>
               <hi>in following the motions of corrupt nature. God created Nature,</hi> ſay they, <hi>and cannot be offended that we follow it.</hi> Several of my Aquaintance have been of that mind; they were given to Laſciviouſneſs, and told me, <hi>That God would not puniſh them for that, ſeeing himſelf had given them ſuch a Nature; and that it was needful to uſe it to multiply the world:</hi> So flattering themſelves in their Sins, to ſatisfie their ſenſes; and more, ſay they, <hi>God hath given all theſe to man, and we cannot be without Seeing; Hearing, Smelling, Feeling and Taſting:</hi> That's all true; but they had not light enough, to diſcern the miſerable ſtate into which man is fallen, by Sin, from that happy one into which God had created him.</p>
            <p>For then in that ſtate man could enjoy the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of his five Senſes; provided he loved and bleſſed God. But ſince he hath fallen into ſin, he can no more enjoy them without offending God; becauſe all the pleaſure he now takes in his five Senſes, is only to ſatisfie himſelf for his own Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Advantage: but before ſin was, the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of his Senſes ſerved only to bleſs, praiſe and glorify the Lord for the Benefits and Mercies he received of him. So that he no ſooner ſaw theſe beautiful things, but his heart was elevated to praiſe God, who had given him theſe beautiful Objects, theſe Melodies, fragrant Odours, delicious Taſtes, and Feelings. So that whatever he ſaw or perceived good or pleaſant, was to him matter of bleſſing God, and magnifying him for his Benefits.</p>
            <p>But ſince man is fallen into ſin, the ſame things are to him matter of offending God: for if he ſees any beautiful thing, he covets it to ſatisfie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and that Self-love retires him from the Love of God: and that is it which makes ſin, ſeeing he
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:65025:59"/>
hath commanded us to love him with all our heart; ſo that we cannot love theſe beautiful things, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out infringing that Command; ſeeing all our heart cannot be in the Love of God, when a part of it is upon beautiful things, fine odours, melodies, delights of the taſte and feeling: For that's a heart divided into as many parts, as there are Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent things it loves; and conſequently far from being intire in the Love of God, as he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us.</p>
            <p>But men are ſo blind, and do ſo blind one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, that every one perſwades himſelf that he loves God, while he loves only himſelf. It is as if they thought to pleaſe God with words, in ſaying with their mouth that they love him: but they deceive themſelves; for as long as they will ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their five natural ſenſes, they will not love God, ſeeing theſe being corrupt, will engender all ſorts of ſin, and conſequently the Death of the Soul. Notwithſtanding no man values theſe evils, and they think it is allowable to ſatisfie their ſenſes, and ſo follow them (often as much as they can) without believing they do evil, and not appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending that <hi>there is nothing more Deceitful than the Heart of Man;</hi> which often flatters it ſelf to its own deſtruction.</p>
            <p>But you, my Child, be more wiſe, learn the truth of things, without yielding your ſelf to be Deceived by falſe appearances. Never believe that it is allowable to take any pleaſure out of God, and far leſs that there is no evil in following your five natural ſenſes, ſince that cannot be without ſin: for though we give our affections but for an hour, to any thing that is not of God, we are for that hour turned from God to the creatures, which is ſin, ſince we do in that, what God hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:65025:59"/>
viz. <hi>We ceaſe to love him with all our heart.</hi> For we ought to love him always without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; and therefore is it, we muſt refrain our ſenſes, and give them laws, that they take no other liberty but to follow the will of God. We may well uſe theſe five natural ſenſes, and employ them to the Glory of God who gave them: for we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without ſeeing, hearing, ſmelling, feeling, and taſting; but we muſt not take pleaſure in theſe for our proper ſatisfaction: we muſt employ them only on things neceſſary; and thoſe that may ſerve to the Glory of God, and the good of our Neighbour.</p>
            <p>For example, man is made up of Soul and Body; he hath need to employ all his five natural ſenſes for the conſervation of the one and th'other: he muſt ſee and behold all things that may ſerve him for the perfection of his ſoul, and hear, touch, taſte and feel them, loving them as the means of his ſalvation: He muſt alſo look upon all things that he needs for entertaining his body; to which his natural ſenſes can afford him much help: for he muſt ſee things neceſſary, as a Houſe to Dwell in, Cloathes to cover him, food to nouriſh him, all that muſt be lookt on. He muſt hear the means to obtain them; ſmell them, that he take nothing hurtful in his aliments; touch and taſte them for that ſame end. For all things neceſſary are good; and it can never be ſin, to uſe them for neceſſity: But it is always evil to uſe them to ſatisfie our ſenſual pleaſures or ſelf-love; becauſe that is an affection we carry to our ſelves: and our affection and love ought to be to God alone; not to things ſo baſe and vile, which we may well uſe, but never love; ſeeing God will have our heart en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:65025:60"/>Which was figured by the earthly Paradiſe, where God placed man at the beginning of the world: He gave him a full liberty to eat of all ſorts of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious fruit; but reſerved that of one only tree, of which he forbad man to eat: and that to let us underſtand, that God does permit us to uſe all the Creatures, which he hath created for us, provided we keep our affection for himſelf only: ſo he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids us to place it on any thing elſe; as marks the firſt Command, <hi>to love God with all our heart</hi>; that is, that our heart ought not to be Divided, and parted to ſomething elſe, but be altogether to him. But men do not penetrate that, as they ought; they perſwade themſelves, that it is allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to love divers other things with God: in which they grievouſly deceive themſelves, while the Command, of God expreſſes punctually, viz. <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart</hi>: if then it had been permitted, to love other things with God, he had not added <hi>with all thy heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We make queſtions and Diſputes upon ſo many Myſteries of our faith, and ſo many degrees of virtue; and we leave behind the principal piece, in which conſiſts all faith and virtues. For what ſhall it profit a man to have penetrated all the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of Nature, and even all the Doctrines of Deep and myſterious Theology, if with all that he fulfil not the Command of <hi>Loving God with his whole heart?</hi> and have his heart Divided into many divers affections, all his knowledge will profit him nothing; we muſt then fulful that firſt Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to <hi>love God with all our heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know well there are ſeveral gloſſes to explain how we muſt love God with all our heart; one ſays, we muſt love him above other things, and where we have an ounce of love to our Money,

Honour, Pleaſures, Parents, or even our ſelf, we muſt have a pound for God; and that ſo we fulfil that firſt Command, and love God with all our heart. Others ſay, we muſt love him ſo, that if the caſe were we muſt loſe God, or our goods, parents or any other thing; that we ſhould loſe all rather than quit God. Others ſay, it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to fulfil that Command. And ſo every one attempts to extinguiſh in the ſpirit of man, the knowledge of the neceſſity of loving God with our whole heart: which is much to be lamented, and afflicts the heart, ſeeing ſo many men prefer the Gloſſes and Sentiments of men, to ſo expreſs Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of God. He had added in vain, the words, <hi>with all your heart,</hi> if we might put a part of our affections or of our heart in the creatures: Yet God never did any thing in vain. If he had not intended to ſhow, that men ought to love him, with all their affections indiviſibly, he had not added <hi>with all your heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſider a little (my Son) with your ſelf, by his grace, if God does not well Deſerve that we love him with all our heart: Our being, and all that we have, is from him; that whole heart, with which he will be loved, he gave it us; ſhould not that be great ingratitude to refuſe him, the heart he gave us himſelf, to the end it might be for himſelf alone? He gives us to enjoy ſo many Creatures, provided we keep our Heart for him, which is the only forbidden fruit.</p>
            <p>Is not that the leaſt God could demand of man, in beſtowing ſo many benefits on him? Ought not man of himſelf to offer unto God his Heart; with all other things although he were not commanded. Whatever we have or can have comes immediately from him, and conſequently all ought voluntarily
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:65025:61"/>
to be offered unto him, without conſtraint. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, on whom can we better beſtow our heart than on God? and who can render it more happy than he? If we beſtow it on our Parents or Friends, they cannot render it happy and content, even in this world. If we place it in the Riches, Honours and Pleaſures of this world, all theſe cannot ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate it, ſeeing they are like ſalt-water; the more our heart Drinks, the more it is parched. And therefore man is very unprovident to place his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in any other thing than in God. There is nothing but him that can ſatisfie and render us happy and content; ſeeing in God alone is all ſorts of Good, and out of him all ſorts of Evil.</p>
            <p>Never reſt then (my Son) on mens Diſcourſes; for they are Liars and Deceivers; and their gloſſes are invented only to flatter their looſeneſs, and that of others, who have no internal Light. So they ſay, <hi>it is impoſſible to keep that Command of loving God with all our heart</hi>; and they ſay ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have no will to do it. But God can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver command things impoſſible: beſide, mans ſpirit can eaſily comprehend, <hi>that it is not impoſſible to love God with all our heart</hi>; for there is nothing more natural to man than love; and there is no object more lovely than God. All that we ſee and know in nature, hath ſome defect; Fire is good, in that it warms and enlightens; but evil, in that it burns and ſmoaks: Water is good, in that it refreſhes and quenches thirſt; but evil, in that it is crude and cold; the Air is good for reſpiration, and to purge bad vapours; but evil in that it hath tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts: the Earth is good, for producing fruits; but evil in that it is miery, and that it produces pricking Thorns and Thiſtles: Gold, Silver, and other Metals are good, in that they ſerve mens
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:65025:61"/>
commodities; but evil for their heavineſs and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity: all the Plants and Fruits of the Earth have ſomething of good and ſomething of evil; and alſo all beaſts of the Earth, the Air, and the Water; and man eſpecially is compoſed of Good and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</p>
            <p>So that there is nothing amiable but God alone, ſince there can never be evil in him; and out of him nothing good to be loved, all being accompanied or mixt with evil. Evil is not an object of Love, nor worthy of our affection. Man then is created to love, and there's nothing more natural to him than love: He muſt needs love ſomething: For he may be as ſoon without life, as without love; for there's nothing but death puts an end to the love of earthly things; but the love which is in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can never end.</p>
            <p>It is created of God, who is eternal; it ſhall alſo endure eternally: but that love can have divers objects: one loves good things, another evil, a-third things mixed of good and evil. Now he that loves good things, loves God, ſince there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing good beſide him, and all the good that is in the Creatures comes from him: He that loves evil things loves the Devil, ſeeing there is nothing evil, but what comes from him. For God hath not crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted evil, nor any thing evil, it is the Devil alone, who hath produced all evils, in ſeparating himſelf from all good, and is by conſequence fallen into all evil, which is nothing elſe but the privation of all good. And he that loves the creatures, loves an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject compoſed of good and evil; for God created them all good, but the Devil by his ſubtil malice hath inſinuated the evil into the good when he gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man's will, who conſented to that mixture of good and evil. For God had created man free, ſo
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:65025:62"/>
he would not hinder him to uſe that liberty, which he had once given him. And therefore man is free, during this life, which is his time of tryal, where he may chooſe one of theſe three Objects, viz if he will love God, or the Devil, or earthly Creatures. Now there is no doubt but God is the moſt lovely Object, who hath nothing of evil.</p>
            <p>Wherefore then ſhould it be impoſſible, to <hi>love God with all our heart,</hi> as he hath commanded? there is nothing ſo lovely as him; and beſide, that love brings us all ſorts of good; for God is as powerful as lovely, and can render man happy in time and in eternity: O what Quiet, Joy and contentment even in this world hath a perſon that loveth God? and how much ſhall theſe Goods be augmented in Eternity? What diſquiet Grief and Trouble in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly hath a man that loves the Devil? for let him do all the evil he can, he is never pleaſed nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: his Conſcience can never be in quiet; and his joy can be only falſe and apparent, becauſe of the ſadneſs which ſin infallibly brings. For evil blinds the Soul, fills the Heart with dark and melancholy thoughts, dulls the Spirit, and tortures the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience as ſoon as the pleaſure of the evil is over. And after theſe temporal evils, he muſt look for greater and eternal ones; becauſe he hath loved the devil, who can give nothing but torments, having nothing elſe in his power. So that evil Object, is as little profitable as lovely. It is the ſame with the Creatures, while we cannot love them without the evils which they carry mixed with the good which God had put in them: And all the creatures of whatever nature, have no power to render us happy neither in this life nor in that to come: For if we love Riches (which are ſo much loved now adays) we are their Slaves, becauſe of the travail we muſt
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:65025:62"/>
uſe to get them, and the care and diſquiet to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them: nor can they afford us more than a little nouriſhment for our bodies, and Cloaths to cover us, which the poor can have alſo, and with leſs trouble: and if they think themſelves happy, becauſe they can ſatisfie their taſte in eating and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king deliciouſly, that is only a greater miſery, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing infirmities and diſeaſes, from which they that live ſoberly, are free: And if we love ſome human Creature, we are yet more miſerable, ſeeing we ſo ſell our liberty, and become ſubject to the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and inclinations of another. So that there is no happineſs for the man, that loves the creatures; ſeeing they have no power to make us happy in this world, and far leſs in eternity.</p>
            <p>And therefore there is nothing but the Love of God, which is profitable and amiable for man; and no other Object: we muſt then conclude from thence, that it is very poſſible to love him; and beſide that, it is profitable and neceſſary both for our tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and eternal happineſs, which I pray you to believe.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>NEver ſuffer your ſelf to be perſwaded, that it is impoſſible to Love God with all our heart, as theſe Ignorants falſly ſay: for there is nothing more eaſie, ſweet, pleaſant, honourable, and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than to love God with all our heart.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> it is <hi>moſt eaſie,</hi> ſeeing man is created to love, Love is the ſtrongeſt paſſion he hath in his nature, ſo that he can no more be without love, than with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out life; conſequently it is very eaſie to follow that natural inclination, where there in no need to do any violence, ſeeing the bent and inclination of man tends thither of it ſelf; and that its eaſie to follow a Love which is engraven in all both ſoul and body. No perſon then need doubt that it is moſt eaſie for him to love.</p>
            <p>But ſome doubt <hi>if it is eaſie to love God, being he is an object inviſible to nature, and we cannot love what we Know not but with great difficulty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That ſentiment is altogether brutiſh, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be in the mind of a reaſonable man, who by his reaſon can ſee; that there is a God, Author of all things; and that there is no creature that hath not its origine from a ſupreme cauſe, who is its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and Creator: or elſe they could not have being nor exiſtence. For although man be above all the other creatures, yet he cannot give light nor heat to the ſun, nor ſuſtain the Waters in the firmament, nor fructtifie the earth. All that muſt needs be from a ſupreme cauſe, whom he may know by his ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, his underſtanding can ſee clearly, even by his bodily eyes, in contemplating the beautiful or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:65025:63"/>
which is in all nature: we need but conſider the diſtinction of Seaſons, the production of Herbs, Plants, Beaſts, and of men. And though we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee the author of all theſe things, yet we can ſee his works palpably and viſibly The ſavage <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans</hi> did both know and confeſs, that there is a God, Author of Nature: and there are <hi>Chriſtians</hi> at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſo unnatural that they dare ſay, <hi>they know not God, becauſe they ſee him not with their fleſhly eyes.</hi> And from that they will argue, that they cannot love him, becauſe they know him not. They ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der themſelves in that like to the Beaſts which have no ſpirit to perceive other than natural things, and ſee them as though they ſubſiſted by themſelves. But men, having a ſpirit more noble than beaſts, comprehend even by their natural ſpirit, that there is a God, Author of Nature: which engaged ſome <hi>Pagans</hi> to ſet up Altars to the <hi>Unknow God.</hi> Some other of them at the Death of our ſaviour Jeſus Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Either nature is a diſſolving, or the God of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſuffers.</hi> Theſe things ought to make the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> of this time bluſh for ſhame, who ſay, <hi>They cannot love God whom they ſee not</hi>: So they ſhall be more puniſhed in Hell, than the <hi>Pagans</hi> that have applyed their ſpirit to know God, by nature. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as on the contrary, theſe <hi>Chriſtians</hi> do not at all ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to know him, neither by Nature nor by Grace, which they have received in the Evangelical Law; beſide that which God gave to <hi>Moſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe brutiſh <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> muſt neither believe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor the Law of God; to ſay, <hi>they cannot love God with all their heart, whom they do not know:</hi> For though they knew not God by his works, which yet they ſee and touch; they ſhould at leaſt know him by the Law of God, which would not enjoin to love God if he were not. Seeing then there is a God, there
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:65025:64"/>
is conſequently an Object amiable above all things; and man being full of love, ought to be eaſily carryed to love him: for love is always carryed to good and beautiful things; ſo that nothing ſhould be more eaſie to him than to love God, who is the ſource of all Good and Beauty.</p>
            <p>But all the difficulty man finds now to love him with all his heart, comes hence, that he doth not apply his ſpirit to diſcover and meditate the works and marvelous things of God; and ſo cannot know nor love him: but he gives himſelf to regard the earthly creatures in themſelves, and attributes to themſelves the little of good and beauty that is in them, and by that means carrys his affections to love the groſs Objects, which are viſible and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to his ſtupid ſenſes.</p>
            <p>It is difficult for ſuch perſons to love God; they cannot love heavenly Objects, while they regard only earthly ones: as they cannot comprehend eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal things, becauſe they contemplate only tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory. And that is not becauſe of their incapacity, ſeeing God hath made them capable of loving him: but becauſe by their free will, they chooſe to love the vile creatures more than him: and it is that vitious choiſe makes them ſay, <hi>that it is impoſſible to love God</hi>; and themſelves make that impoſſibility. They are like perſons, who ſtaying in a valley full of Snow, complain that they are cold, and that they cannot be warmed among that Snow; which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true: but if they would walk a little to get out of that Snow, and get up to the Mountain, they ſhould well feel, that it is full eaſie to become warm, where the ſun beſtows his rays. It is even ſo with earthly men, who pleaſe themſelves in the Snow of worldly luſtres: they ſay and think, <hi>it is impoſſible to be warmed by the Love of God,</hi> which is alſo very
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:65025:64"/>
true, ſo long as they remain in the affections of the pleaſures of this valley of tears. For nothing can warm them in the love of God, while there; all is but Snow, which cools them.</p>
            <p>He that hath his pleaſures in carnal things, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have them in ſpiritual: and he that puts his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in periſhing goods, cannot have them in eternal ones: and he that takes his pleaſures here in ſenſualities, cannot have them in ſpiritual things; ſeeing all theſe things are contraries, which can never abide together.</p>
            <p>So long then as a man feels himſelf cold in the Love of God, it is a token that he lives yet in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to the things of this valley of Snow, which are quenchers of the Love of God. He cannot then feel in himſelf other than an impoſſibility (or at leaſt, great difficulty) to love God with his whole heart. But if they would quit their affection to this valley of miſery, and mount up to the conſideration of eternal things; they ſhould ſoon feel the Sun of Righteouſneſs warm our Soul, and the Love of God fill our heart, which would not only find Facility therein, but alſo Sweetneſs, Pleaſure, Honour, and Profit: ſeeing in effect there is nothing more pleaſant than to love God.</p>
            <p>For me, I have experienced, that all love to the Creatures, is bitter, and that the Love of God only is ſweet and pleaſant: for when I loved Riches, they gave me aboundance of trouble to preſerve them; when I loved Honours, I found there many bitter and piercing diſpleaſures, when I was not eſteem'd or honour'd as I wiſhed; ſo that ſometimes one Sleight cauſed me more pain than a hunderd Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours had given me contentment: When I loved the pleaſures and delights of this life, I found there great bitterneſs, becauſe there is none of theſe pleaſures
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:65025:65"/>
that carry not its own pain with it: for the pleaſures of the taſte breed poverty and diſeaſes, and are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiable; they never ſatisfie: no more than thoſe of the fleſh, which reſemble Salt-water, the more one drinks, the more drought. I have remarked that in ſeveral carnal perſons, who (after having ruined their Body and Health in ſatisfying their concupiſcence) uſed all means to cure their infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities; and that to the end they might wallow yet more in their naſty pleaſures. And when I have loved any human Creature, it was always painful for me to ſatisfie and pleaſe them; and the fear of offending or looſing them, was unto me a continual anxiety. So that there is nothing but God alone whom it is eaſie and ſweet to love.</p>
            <p>Nothing is more pleaſant: for all other Loves have Grief mixed with their greateſt Pleaſures; we ſee young people marry with joy; there is nothing but mirth, Plays and Dances; but the Wedding is ſcarce over, and ſometimes ſooner, when we ſee them ſad and afflicted, penſive and melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; Diſeaſes attacque them, the Care of their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs and Houſhold diſquiets them, Fortune is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, and in the end their Pleaſures terminate in divers Griefs; the Pleaſures of the Fleſh in Pains, thoſe of the Pallate into Diſeaſes, Honour into Contempt and Slights; even as <hi>Haman's</hi> Pleaſure, when invited to the Queens Banquet, changed into Grief, when he ſaw that <hi>Mordecai</hi> would not ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him the honour he deſired; ſo do all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſures terminate in Diſpleaſure and ſadneſs.</p>
            <p>So that we can find no other true pleaſure in the world, but to love God only; which is full pleaſant, and alſo honourable: for what Honour is man capable of, approaching unto that of loving a God ſo mighty? who created Heaven and Earth,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:65025:65"/>
and all other things; and ſuſtains them by his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power; and who can give unto men eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Salvation. If we count it Honour that we love a King, a Prince, or other Perſon in Authority; how much ought we to think us honoured that we may love a God who is incomprehenſibly good and wiſe? and what Honour is it for a ſmall Worm of the Earth, ſuch as man is, that he may love God, who deſires to be loved of him; and even com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands him to love him with all his heart; As if God delighted to honour man; by requiring to be loved of him. And the honour of loving God is ſo conſiderable, that it paſſes all that man is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of in heaven or on earth.</p>
            <p>Moreover, it is alſo Profitable for him, ſeeing that love can render him happy in this world and to all eternity. Whereas all the Creatures together cannot procure us the one nor the other. What profit can we draw from the Creatures? who are unable to give us a Day, yea an hour, or even a moments life. What could they then to give us Eternal Life? All the advantage men can Draw one from another, is a little Money, Honour, or Pleaſure, which vaniſh, and moſt part ends in pain and grief, as I have before ſhown.</p>
            <p>And therefore we cannot truely call Pleaſures the Advantages and Profits that men cauſe one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. No more ought we to eſteem Honours, which are but a blaſt of wind, which vaniſhes in the air of a ſmall Diſgrace, and ſo leaves nothing in the perſon honoured, but a piercing grief, that he is no more honoured. What profit is it for a man to get of his fellow a little more money? It is only a more weighty charge to bear in this world; where the richeſt are the moſt miſerable; for they can never have more of their Riches, but a little
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:65025:66"/>
neceſſary nouriſhment and cloathing to cover them: all the reſt is ſuperfluous to them, and ſhould ſerve others, ſeeing he muſt not take for himſelf, but for pure neceſſity. What's over gives only the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet, Care and Trouble of Diſpenſing or beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>
            <p>So that a Lacquey is happier than his Maſter; he hath no care but for himſelf; but the Maſter muſt care for himſelf and all under him, and ſee that nothing be wanting to them, or elſe his ſervants will upbraid or deſpiſe him. Is not that a poor advantage, a little money that men can afford<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet he that receives it, is obliged to a thouſand thanks; and beſide, to take a more honourable ſtate; which brings him more Care and Diſquiet than he had before he was ſo rich. That teſtifies that nothing in this world can advantage man, or give him true Honour, Pleaſure, or Content. And ſo there is nothing but God, can render man happy in this life, and that to come: ſeeing all the advantages men reap one from another, ſerve but for their damnation. Their Pleaſures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire the Soul from God; their Honours cauſe them to fall into Pride, and their Riches into Avarice, which leads them to the broad way of damnation; and notwithſtanding they fancy themſelves happy, for having the good will of men; which is cauſe of their eternal miſery.</p>
            <p>But ſo great is their blindneſs, that they cannot ſee theſe miſeries, however evident; They per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade themſelves, that they are Happineſſes, that their Diſquiets are Peace, and their Diſpleaſures, Contentments. For how many perſons are there in the world, who ſtudy all the Days of their life to perfect themſelves in ſome Science, to be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of men? how many that labour, travail, and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:65025:66"/>
put themſelves in ſeveral hazards to gain a little money? and how many, that expoſe riches and life too, to preſerve their honour? Although all theſe things be vain, yet they love and eſteem them, often more than they do God: for we ſee them not do for him what they do for the Creatures; they render to them painful and hard ſervices; and imagin to themſelves that there is more difficulty to love God, than to love the World. Notwithſtanding <hi>the Love of God is eaſie, ſweet, pleaſant, honourable and profitable</hi>; as I have ſhown: but the love of the world is diſquieting, ſad, without repoſe, honour or profit, for time and for eternity.</p>
            <p>Which you may remark (my Child) by the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons I have above deduced to you; which ſhould open your eyes, to diſcern Falſhood from Truth: that you may never give place to the falſe perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which the blinded <hi>Chriſtians</hi> would eſtabliſh. They ſay, <hi>it is impoſſible to love God with all our heart</hi>; and ſo blaſpheme againſt him. For God could not command an impoſſibility: but all that he commands is good, eaſie, and pleaſant. And if you conſider narrowly his ten commands, you ſhall find but two of action, viz. That of <hi>lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God</hi>; and the other to <hi>honour Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> The other eight are but prohibitions to do evil: as not to <hi>kill, ſteal, bear falſe witneſs,</hi> and the reſt.</p>
            <p>Is it then impoſſible to abſtain from committing theſe evils, that theſe blinded minds ſay it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to keep the Commands of God? Believe not theſe falſhoods, but conſtrain your ſelf to get out of that valley of Snow, which is the Riches and Pleaſures of this life; and aſcend to the Mount of Conſideration of things eternal, and you ſhall

of Spirit, an inward Peace and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in your Soul: Which are things far more eſtimable than the vain Pleaſures and impure Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments, and aboundance of the Riches of this world; which can never ſatisfie our ſouls, being they are ſpiritual, and cannot conſequently be ſatisfied with material things.</p>
            <p>Therefore is it that there was never any man perfectly content and ſatisfied in this world, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he loved God with his whole heart. There is no other but ſuch an one who can be entirely content: for only the Love of God is capable ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſatisfie our ſouls; for they are little divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which cannot be fully contented out of God, from whom they proceeded.</p>
            <p>Therefore muſt you (my Child) labour to attain to that love: for when you have truely found it, you ſhall have all things, and you ſhall reign over all the world, having in contempt all that is not God. And you have no violence to uſe with God to obtain his love, ſeeing he gives it liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and freely, to all that deſire and ask it: and even compels men by an expreſs Command which he hath given them: but you muſt do a little vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to your ſelf to obtain that love; becauſe your affections are carried to other things than him, ſo you muſt reclaim them, and conſtrain them to return to their God, and in that, you ſhall have ſo many combats, as you have habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes to love other things than God. If you be then ſtrongly addicted to ſelf-love, or Love of other Creatures, your combats ſhall be ſo much the greater.</p>
            <p>But the buſineſs deſerves ſuffering well, ſeeing after we ſhall enjoy ſo great Good temporal and eternal, we ſhould ſpare nothing to gain ſuch a
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:65025:68"/>
Treaſure; the Pain ſhall paſs ſwiftly, and the Joy endure eternally. And therefore you muſt ſuffer willingly, to retire your affections from earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, and place them in God alone. I have ſufficiently ſhown you in my laſt, that, that is good, pleaſant, honourable and profitable. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains for you now to put it in practice.</p>
            <p>Examin once, what it is that you love beſide God, and then deteſt that love, and withdraw from it your heart: If you love objects without your ſelf, flee from them, as the enemies of your good; looſe from them your heart, and deſire no more to ſee them. And if your Affections be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied in Self-love, remove them from an object ſo little lovely, to place them in God, who only merits your affections, and nothing elſe. Proteſt then againſt that natural inclination of Self-love, and yield no more any thing to that nature, but things purely neceſſary; for it is your greateſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, to which you muſt not furniſh Arms to fight againſt you the better. You muſt know, that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature wars againſt the Love of God, as far as you yield to it; So give it the leaſt ſatisfaction you can, even till you have overcome it: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw then from it your Affections; you muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain it as a Horſe with Bridle, that it kick not; nor attempt, but to ſerve the maſter you love.</p>
            <p>Behold the means to render you free to love God with your whole heart: for as ſoon as your affections are retired from all Creatures, they will be aſſuredly carryed to love God their Creator; becauſe the Love of God is the element of our Soul; in which only it can live, recreate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it ſelf. That Love of God is the true cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our Souls, whither they fall of themſelves ſo ſoon as they are diſengaged of other affections,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:65025:68"/>
which are all vain. It is as with a Stone thrown into the Air, which will not reſt till it fall on the Earth, which is its center, unleſs it be retained with bonds or other thing.</p>
            <p>It is the very ſame with man's Soul, which is thrown into the air of the Vanities of this world; It cannot find reſt there: if we did not retain it by Force, by Baits and Allurements of Affection for earthly things, doubtleſs it would preſently fall into the Love of God, which is its center and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; where it can reſt and recreate it ſelf to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; becauſe the Soul hath nothing more ſuitable to its nature, than God, from whom it proceeded; and it can never repoſe till it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to him; and when it is compelled to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main out of its element; it is as a Fiſh which by Nets and Lines is forced out of the water: which is to it very diſagreeable, and cauſes to it Death, if it be not quickly returned into the water.</p>
            <p>The ſame happens to the Soul, when it ſuffers it ſelf to be entangled in the nets of earthly Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; it muſt quickly die, becauſe it cannot find there an element ſuitable to its divine nature, and ſo it languiſhes, withers, and dies an eternal death; unleſs it break the nets of earthly Affections, to return to its element, which is the Love of God.</p>
            <p>You muſt, my Son, labour that you may break all the bonds of earthly Affections: and ſo ſoon as you feel affection for any thing, that is not God, reſcind it quickly; for it is a chain which retains you out of your element: and though it ſhould be painful for you to looſe your heart, from any thing to which it enclines, theſe Pains ſhall quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly change into Conſolations: for you ſhall no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner be returned into the Love of God, but you
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:65025:69"/>
ſhall bathe in eaſe and pleaſure, as fiſh newly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the water, which is its element. It is for that Jeſus Chriſt ſays, that <hi>his yoak is eaſie, and his Burthen Light.</hi> He calls a Yoak our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural inclinations, becauſe we muſt conſtrain and retain them; and they are troubleſom and grievous to bear. For if we follow them, we precipitate our ſelves into a thouſand Evils; ſeeing nature, being corrupted by ſin, enclines always to evil. And theſe evils are often troubleſom and weighty to bear.</p>
            <p>I know well, that to us it ſeems grievous, that we may not in any thing follow our natural incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations: but if we take on that Yoak for the Love of God, it will become light and eaſie to us, as Jeſus Chriſt hath taught.</p>
            <p>No perſon can diſpence or excuſe himſelf from bearing it, ſince our firſt Father <hi>Adam</hi> laid it on the ſhoulders of all his Poſterity; all men in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and every one in particular, are charged with the miſeries which ſin brought upon human nature. They are all ſubject to Heat, Cold, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance of the Air, Hunger, Thirſt, Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and Diſeaſes of the Body, to Ignorance, and Inconſtancy of Spirit, and the diſorderly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Paſſions; for ſin hath brought all theſe things upon man's nature, which God created al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together perfect: but ſince all men have pertaken of <hi>Adam's</hi> Sin, they are alſo ſubject to his Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>
            <p>That is the Yoak which God hath given man to ſatisfie his divine Juſtice: So that all men coming into the world muſt bear that Yoak; will they or not, none can evite it. And it is a happineſs which man hath had above the Angels, while he can have Pardon of his ſin, for a ſmall time of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:65025:69"/>
as is this ſhort life: for the diſobedient Angels were confined to Hell without remiſſion: whereas man is only ſent for a ſmall time to this world, to do Penitence, and after return to God, whence he proceeded. And therefore men ought voluntarily to embrace that Penitence, to ſatisfie the Juſtice of God, when it is ſo light and ſhort, in regard of eternal Damnation; to which the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels were condemned when they diſobeyed God. And that Penitence is light and eaſie, when we will bear it as a Yoak, which God hath given us for our ſins.</p>
            <p>Therefore alſo Jeſus Chriſt calls it <hi>his Yoak,</hi> and not ours; to make us underſtand, that all the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of this life are light and eaſie, when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them from the Hand of God, and to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his divine Juſtice: but that ſame yoak, the ſame miſeries are full heavy and grievous, when we bear them grudgingly, or ſeek to be delivered, and diſcharged of them; which cannot be in this valley of tears, which is only a Priſon of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence, where we muſt ſtay, until the time of our Penitence be over, to ſome longer then to others, according to the ſentence of the great Judge.</p>
            <p>But if we will take this Life of Penitence for a time of delights and Pleaſure; we muſt make an eternal Penitence, which ſhall never end, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins even in this life: For although we ſhould em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy all the powers of our ſpirit, and forces of our body, to charm our Miſeries or evite ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings; they will not leave us for all that. And whatever we do or ſay, we muſt always feel heat and cold, diſeaſes of body and troubles of ſpirit, the changing of ſeaſons, and revolutions of times, and ſo many other accidents which befal man, during the courſe of his life: All that muſt be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:65025:70"/>
and painful to him, if he take it not as the Yoak of God: but if he embrace it affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably as Jeſus Chriſt did, all ſhall be light and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to him; as were unto our Saviour Miſeries, Perſecutions, Torment, and even Death: not that his nature was inſenſible of the Pains and Torments which they cauſed him; but he ſuffered all for the Love of God, which made the moſt heavy Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, and the bitter Gall of his cruel Paſſion ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to him eaſie, light and pleaſant.</p>
            <p>If you will, my ſon, be his Diſciple, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a true <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> embrace with him all the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of this preſent life: ſuffer patiently what ever befals you contrary to your will; and above all, deny and renounce your ſelf, as Jeſus Chriſt your Captain taught and practiſed. He warred againſt the inclinations of corrupt nature in every thing. For becauſe they tend always to Greatneſs and to receive Honour, he chooſed Meanneſs and Contempt: becauſe they tend always to covet ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, he would be poor: and becauſe they ſeek always their eaſe and Pleaſure, he choſe uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſufferings. So that he always cruſhed the inclinations of corrupted Nature; conſtraining it by the Bridle and Yoak of the Love of God, doing every thing contrary to the inclinations of that corrupted nature.</p>
            <p>Behold your Captain, who marches before you, and calls you to follow him; ſaying, <hi>If any man will come after me, let him take up his Croſs, and deny himſelf, and follow me.</hi> You muſt not, my Son, ſeek any other Maſter, nor hear other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; for men deceive and are deceived; who will take another way, than Jeſus Chriſt took; or will enter into life eternal, by means quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to thoſe which he uſed himſelf. If there were
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:65025:70"/>
another way of ſalvation, Jeſus Chriſt would have taught us it, and had followed it himſelf; ſeeing all he did upon the earth, was to give us an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that we might follow and imitate him. If then there were any thing better than to renounce our corrupt Nature, doubtleſs he had taught us it. Never go to perſwade your ſelf, that men are too frail to obſerve the Law of God and the Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counſels; ſeeing the one and the other was given us only for our frailty: for if we had been perfect, we had not needed any Laws: It is ſin which hath brought theſe Laws upon man.</p>
            <p>Yet you muſt not believe that the Laws are evil, ſeeing they are very good, and are the true means of our ſalvation: For without them man had never known his ſins, and had inſenſibly aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned God; living without ſtop, worſe than a Beaſt, not feeling nor knowing his miſery. You muſt know, that <hi>Adam</hi> was not aſhamed to ſee himſelf naked, before God called him, asking him, <hi>Adam, where art thou?</hi> yet he had ſinned, and his Wife alſo, in the Abſence of God; and lived ſtill freely after their ſin, as they had done before: but ſo ſoon as God called them, they began to fear and tremble, and be aſhamed: which made them flee and hide themſelves from him, not daring to appear before him as formerly. The ſame effect did the Law of God in mens minds in <hi>Moſes's</hi> Days; for then alſo had they quite forſaken their God, and lived without minding their duties, giving themſelves up to all ſorts of ſins, without knowing them; and for that would God give them a Law, that by it they might know their ſins, and ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from committing them. That Law was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of ten Commands, or ten things that they were to obſerve. It is not a Burthen laid upon
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:65025:71"/>
men by God, as ſome ignorants ſay, blaſpheming God. He hath not given them Commands which are impoſſible for them to obſerve; for theſe things were to be obſerved in all times, although they were not diſtinctly commanded or forbidden. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural reaſon ought ſufficiently to have taught man, <hi>that he should not Kill, Steal, commit Adultery, bear Falſe Witneſs, Covet his Neighbour's Goods, nor take the name of his God in vain:</hi> And that ſame natural reaſon was ſufficient to ſhow them, that they ought to love God with all their heart, ſince they had received of him their being, and all other things, and received continually benefits for their ſuſtenance. The ſame natural Light was ſufficient to ſhow to man <hi>that he should Honour his Father and Mother</hi>; ſince they have brought us up, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for us, nouriſhed and taught us in our ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der age. For ingratitude is an unnatural thing; for even the moſt ſavage Beaſts acknowledge their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactors.</p>
            <p>So that the Law of God, hath not charged man with any thing, that he was not obliged to in all times. For from his creation, he was obliged to Love God with all his heart, and to honour Father and Mother; which are the two things comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the ten commands: the other eight are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prohibitions of doing evil; which man was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways obliged to abſtain from, and ever ſhall. And the cauſe why God hath declared theſe things in form of Commands, is man's infirmity; who had ſo forgotten his duty, that he committed evil with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing it; and ſhould become ſtill worſe, if the Law of God had not been given him, as a Voice to reclaim him, and to aſk him, as to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, where art thou?</hi> for without that Law, he had not known his ſin.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:65025:71"/>It is given him as a Light in the midſt of his darkneſs, and as a Medicine, for his Evils: But men now adays call theſe mercies weighty Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, yea inſupportable to their frailty: which is a groſs ingratitude, and deſerves to be puniſht, and that God ſhould withdraw his Mercies from theſe ingrate and ſtupid perſons, ſeeing they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the benefits of the Law of God, and the ſweet and light Yoak of the Evangelical Law into Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſements and inſupportable Burthens; ſaying, <hi>that it is impoſſible to obſerve them</hi>: and ſo they belie the word of Jeſus Chriſt, viz. <hi>That his Yoak is eaſie, and his Burthen Light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Believe your Saviour, my Son, and hear not theſe lying men, that ſay the contrary: Abandon your ſelf to God, embrace the Evangelical Law; and you ſhall know by experience, that his Yoak is eaſie, and his burthen light. Which ſhe aſſures you of, who remains</p>

of the temptations with which the Devil vexed them that have reſolved to embrace true Virtue.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>NEver weary in the Service of God; the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of it is the difficulteſt. You know that Roſe-buſhes bear thorns before they bear Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: it is the ſame with true Virtue. It begins with Thorns, a little pricking to corrupt nature: but beautiful Roſes will come in their ſeaſon. True virtue hath nothing pricking in it, no more than the Roſe; for it is altogether ſweet, beautiful and fragrant; nothing is ſweeter than virtue. It gives Peace and pleaſure to the Soul; for Peace and Joy are fruits of the Holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>O what Peace and Contentment hath a virtuous Soul! it ſeeks nothing, fears nothing, nor hopes nothing, but in the promiſes of its God. It acquieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in his providence. It yields it ſelf to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted ſweetly at the will and pleaſure of the Lord. It is not diſquieted nor ſtraitned by any thing, but in peace expects what God will diſpoſe. It affects nothing, precipitates nothing; knowing that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and Long-ſuffering are the fruits of the Holy Spirit. It is meek in it ſelf, and toward its Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: for Goodneſs, Meekneſs, and gentleneſs are alſo fruits of the Holy Spirit, which he produces out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the ſoul he poſſeſſes. A virtuous ſoul is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways modeſt and moderate in all its actions, chaſte, continent and full of charity; becauſe the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, who produces in it true virtue, produces alſo his twelve fruits, which are ſweet and agreeable to God and Men. So that true Virtue, is deſirable, for the ſweetneſs it carries in it ſelf: It is deſirable for its. Beauty; for nothing is more agreeable and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:65025:72"/>
than true Virtue; for all good perſons eſteem and honour it, ſeeing it is more eſtimable and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable than all created things. It can well abide a narrow ſearch and near view; for the neavrer we approach it, the more we diſcover its beauty. It is alſo fragrant, as the Roſe; for true Virtue reliſhes in the noſtrils of every one; even of the Wicked, who often are engaged to eſteem it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they will not follow it. And if we hear ſometimes well inclined perſons, deſpiſe true Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, it is becauſe they know it not, and have been often deceived with apparent Virtues, wherewith the men of this time are filled, which cauſes that the true is not ſo reliſhed as it ſhould: but though it be not known nor eſteemed among men, yet it is ſweet, pleaſant, and ſavoury unto God, who loves true Virtue as his Spouſe, becauſe it is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted inſeparably with him.</p>
            <p>And therefore (my Child) you muſt endeavour to acquire that beautiful Roſe of true Virtue; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though you ſhould feel the pricking of Thorns in the plucking it. Theſe pains will quickly paſs, but the beautiful Roſe of Virtue will never fade. It ſhall be eternally beautiful, and of a good ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour before God: ſo you muſt ſpare nothing, to acquire true Virtue. If you feel pains therein, they ſhall change into repoſe: if you feel Grief, it ſhall turn to Joy: if Repugnance, it ſhall be changed into Contentment: for there is only the beginning which is difficult in the acqueſt of true Virtue.</p>
            <p>The reaſon is, becauſe it is then the Devil uſes all means to divert us from it: He knows well that he can gain nothing upon us when we have acquired it; and ſo he uſes all his forces at the beginning, to hinder us from arriving at it: that is the reaſon, why the Scripture ſays, <hi>My</hi>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:65025:73"/>
               <hi>Son, if thou wilt embrace true virtue, prepare your Heart for Temptation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Devil leaves them in quietneſs, who have only apparent virtues; or thoſe that have on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good deſires; becauſe he can enſnare them at his pleaſure: The firſt by preſumption of their ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe of apparent Virtues; and the others in precipitating them unto death, before they have brought their good deſires to effect: knowing well, that Hell is paved with Good-wills, which men had in this world, without putting them in practice: And therefore he leaves all ſuch perſons in peace, as well as the Worldlings; knowing well, that he ſhall not miſs them at one time or other: and ſo he leads them ſoftly to Hell, with a ſilken rope, without vexing or tempting them much.</p>
            <p>But ſuch, as have truely reſolved to follow Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and embrace true Virtue; he labours night and day to tempt them, and by all means, becauſe he knows, that he needs not pretend more to it, when they have arrived at true Virtue. Then they ſhall laugh at him and all his aſſaults; and ſo he attempts to ſhake them at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and to make them loſe heart in conſidering the difficulty there is in acquiring true Virtue.</p>
            <p>Firſt he ſhows them the Pains and Thorns, which they ſhall find in the mortification of their ſenſes: After he repreſents an impoſſibility to attain to ſo great perfection: He ſhows them alſo the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of other perſons, whom they eſteem good per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and tending to true Virtue. For it is enough to them to make a morally good outſide, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being at the trouble to mortifie their five na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſenſes, nor to renounce themſelves: and the Devil perſwades them, that that is not neceſſary for their ſalvation; but he is but a Deceiver and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducer
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:65025:73"/>
of Souls, that he may in the end render them partakers of his Miſeries.</p>
            <p>Keep your ſelf, My Son, from his deceipts, and give no ear to his ſuggeſtions; nor to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of your Nature. For neither the one nor the other can hinder you to arrive at true Perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; provided you have a firm Reſolution, God will aſſiſt you, and give you all that you need, if you remain faithful to him: And after you ſhall ſee, that through God you can do all things, and ſhall ſay with David, <hi>With my God I leap over walls.</hi> For ſo great is the power of true Virtue, that it makes appear light the things that are moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous to nature.</p>
            <p>That is it which Jeſus Chriſt intended by the compariſon, <hi>If you had Faith as a grain of Muſtard-ſeed, you ſhould remove Mountains:</hi> It was not ſo marvelous a thing to remove Mountains of Sand and Stone, ſeeing that would add nothing to our ſoul: but he ſpeaks of Mountains of difficulties, which we find in the acquiſition of true Virtue. It appears at the beginning as an inhabitable Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, whither one can never arrive.</p>
            <p>But if the Soul perſevere faithfully in its good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, it will revive by Faith in the Promiſes of God; and with it will remove all theſe Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains <hi>of imaginary</hi> difficulties; ſince in effect there is no difficulty in the acquiring of true Virtue We have no ſooner abandoned earthly Affections, but we mount with eaſe unto true perfection; for all the difficulties we apprehend, are but falſe viſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which the Devil hath placed, as Vizards to frighten them that begin in true virtue. But we need not fear, for the Mask being taken off, we find true Virtue, which is ſweet, pleaſant and agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And he that hath once diſcovered and known
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:65025:74"/>
it, finds no difficulty in it afterward; but on the contrary much Quiet and conſolation. Though the Devil will never ceaſe to tempt and purſue us. He tempted Jeſus Chriſt, and purſued him even to the Deſart, whither he had gone by the conduct of the Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>Therefore we muſt not be ſhaken, by the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations which the Devil makes us; but we muſt deſpiſe him, as an Enemy of God, and who hath no power over man, but what himſelf gives him: otherways the Devil is in his nature meer impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, who could not lift a pile of ſtraw from the ground, if man do not permit him. So man, when he is in the Grace of God, may well mock at the Devil; ſeeing then he cannot hurt him. He waits and goes about him indeed who is in the Grace of God, but cannot hurt him; unleſs he fall from that grace, or that he conſent to the Tentations and Suggeſtions of the Devil.</p>
            <p>It is nothing to feel Tentations, though they ſhould continue all the days of our lives, provided we do not conſent to them. It is but a ſmoak, which diſſipates in the air; It is not very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; but it cannot hurt him that does not approach it: even ſo is it with the Tentation of the Devil; it vaniſhes, if we do not follow it. It is the Devil's work to tempt, but man's to reſiſt thereto. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſays St. Peter, <hi>My Brethren, watch and be ſober, for your enemy the Devil goes about like a roaring Lion, ſeeking whom he may devour. Reſiſt him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, continuing firm in the Faith.</hi> He ſays ſo to teach us, that we muſt not ſleep in the Service of God, nor give up to follow our Appetites; but that we muſt be ſober, and watch with perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; for we have an Enemy who never ſleeps. We muſt overcome him by the ſtrength of faith,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:65025:74"/>
which is able to tranſport the greateſt Mountains of difficulties, that can ever preſent to our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
            <p>And if the Devil ſhould tempt us night and day, he cannot hurt our Soul, provided it remain in faith, which begets Hope in the promiſes of God: He hath ſaid, <hi>Come unto me all ye that are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt.</hi> He excepts none; but calls all men in general, and every one in particular; ſaying, <hi>they muſt come to him if they be heavy laden</hi>; and he promiſes to eaſe us. What ſurer caution would we have? we have there the Promiſe of God himſelf; for he ſays, <hi>That he will comfort us, if we go to him in need.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am willing to believe (my Son) that you are burthened with Tentations of the Devil; for he ſees that you ſeek after true Virtue; and ſo he will not fail to attacque you in the beginning, and ſo much the more as you have given him advantage over your Soul by your former ſins. He will not quit that fortreſs, but by force, ſeeing he hath ſo long been Ruler and Governour there. You muſt now then chaſe him by force; it is in that only <hi>that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven ſuffers Violence, and the Violent take it by Force.</hi> For we are the Children of God, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently Heirs of his Kingdom; ſo we have no need to take that Kingdom by force. It is given us freely of God. But we muſt uſe great force to reſiſt the Devil, and our corrupt Nature, which are the two Enemies of our Salvation, who would rob our ſouls of that Kingdom, though it belongs to us, as the inheritance of our heavenly Father: and that is the reaſon why he ſays, that <hi>the Violent raviſh it,</hi> and <hi>that we muſt take it by force.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not, that we muſt fight with Weapons of Iron, to gain that Kingdom: for all the bodily force
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:65025:75"/>
of Nature together could do nothing to the gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it: but we muſt fight our enemies with ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Weapons, of which the chief is faith; ſeeing it begets Love, and Hope toward God, the two Bucklers to defend us againſt all ſorts of Enemies.</p>
            <p>For he that loves God, fears nothing; ſeeing, <hi>Love is ſtrong as Death</hi>; and <hi>he that putteth his truſt in God, ſhall never be confounded.</hi> So that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ſhall never have power over him that reſiſts him, by faith. So, my ſon, fear nothing; perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in the good reſolution of attaining true Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. Give all your affections to love God, and you shall be ſtrong as Death. Place your Hope in God alone, and you ſhall never be confounded, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. For having theſe Arms, you need not fear the Aſſaults of your Enemy the Devil. He is as a chained Dog, and can go no farther than goes the Chain of man's conſent. If he come to vex you in the night, during ſleep, that cannot hurt you, ſeeing man does not uſe his free will while he ſleeps, and ſo cannot conſent to the Tentation of the Devil, which he knows full well: but he comes to vex man in ſleep, that he may get him to conſent (when awakened) to evil ſuggeſtions, which he excited in his ſpirit while aſleep: for a man aſleep, ſins not.</p>
            <p>But be prompt to evelate your ſpirit unto God as ſoon as you awake, and then the tentation ſhall vaniſh as ſmoak. But if you begin to agitate in your ſpirit, the things which you dreamed, by the Tentation of the Devil, and give your conſent thereto, or take pleaſure in it: then you fall into ſin, and ſhall conſent to the Devil; who is never more overcome than when we deſpiſe him. Therefore I adviſe you never to regard Dreams, or Evil thoughts which he repreſents to you aſleep; nay
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:65025:75"/>
nor thoſe which he offers when you are awake: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you cannot ſin, ſo long as you do not take pleaſure in, or conſent thereto.</p>
            <p>Although you ſhould be tormented all the days of your life by evil thoughts, that ſhall not make you loſe the Grace of God, ſo long as they diſpleaſe you. Yet you have cauſe, to humble your ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, for your former ſins: for if you had never ſinned, and willingly given entry to evil thoughts, the Devil would not have had the power to cauſe you to have them after againſt your will. But what is paſt is no more in your power: it remains only that you ſtrive for the time to come, never more to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to them. Remain then faithful to God, and perſevere in your good reſolution which you have taken to find true Virtue. Never weary in that ſearch; it deſerves well that you endure ſome trouble: for even the worldlings endure yet much more in the ſervice of the world. For what Diſquiets, Cares and Travails does not a Merchant ſuffer to gain a little Money? What pains muſt not a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man take, to preſerve his Honour? what Fatigue and Toil hath the Labourer and Tradeſmam to gain their Food, which you have in the ſervice of God without trouble! Will you not ſuffer a little Tentation of the Devil, to arrive at true Virtue, which is to buy at a very eaſie rate? For all that the Devil can do to you is inconſiderable, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the joy which attends you in Heaven: if you endure with perſeverance, he may well diſturb your Spirit with divers Tentations; but can never cauſe you to fall into ſin, without that your own will conſent to him. For when you have rendred your will to God, he will keep it well, and not permit that the Devil gain to make it conſent unto Evil. And what more the Devil can do is but a ſmall
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:65025:76"/>
matter. He ſhould have no power over your will, if he had not had ſo formerly, ſo he could not have troubled you ſo often. For I perceive often his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions againſt me, by you, againſt your will. He knows that I belong to God, and follow his will, which he contradicts to his power; but he cannot hinder that I know and practiſe it; and ſo hinder that you ſhould follow it, and cauſes you to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict it often in ſmall things, becauſe he cannot obtain that you ſhould oppoſe it in great things. He gains always a little, when he cannot gain much.</p>
            <p>I know well that is againſt your will, and what comes to paſs againſt it, comes aſſuredly from the Devil: for a man cannot be contrary to his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per will: what he wills, he deſires; and what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, effects it ſo far as he can: And therefore it is the Devil that does in him whatever he does againſt his own will. If you comprehended well that, (my Son) you would reſiſt him more, and would no more cauſe me ſo much pain, by the contradictions you make to the Will of God; which, by his Grace, I know in things great and ſmall; and it you muſt follow to your power. But you have not yet ſufficiently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the ſubtil Snares of that old Serpent; nor overcome your ſelf, nor human conſiderations, which are the Chains that yet hinder your flight to God: but do not loſe courage. If I have overcome the world, you may alſo overcome it, and ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come maſter of the Devil and of your ſelf. God is not partial, nor an Accepter of Perſons. He beſtows his Grace upon all them that ſeek and deſire it in truth. I wiſh you theſe deſires, and remain</p>

            <head>THE XII. LETTER. The Devil, the Enemy of true Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, Oppoſes it with all manner of Devices.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>To the ſame, to whom is ſhewn that it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to know the Wiles of the Devil, with which he oppoſes true Virtue, that we may evite them, which are ſhown in this and the following Letters: as <hi>1.</hi> That the Devil inſinuates himſelf into what is ſenſual in man. <hi>2.</hi> That he ſuits himſelf to the impulſes and inclinations of every one, leaving the reſt in quietneſs.</p>
            </argument>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Son;</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Spake much to you in my laſt of the tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Devil, becauſe it is as neceſſary for you to know, in order to your ſalvation, as it is to know true virtue. For if you know only the good, you ſhall eaſily fall into the evil, even with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out perceiving it: and ſo ſhall ſometimes follow evil, thinking that you do well. But ſince I have undertaken to teach you all things neceſſary to ſalvation, I muſt ſpeak to you of the malice of the Devil, and how he tempts men to lead them to perdition: as he hath already led many, even ſuch as have never diſcovered, that is was the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil who incited them to do evil, and ſo have ſuffered themſelves to be ſeduced inſenſibly by him; though they have been perſons well enclined, yet have they been loſt by ignorance.</p>
            <p>For ignorance does not excuſe; before God.
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:65025:77"/>
Every one is obliged to know what he ought to do and leave, that he may pleaſe the Lord. If then I ſhould now ſpeak to you only of the beauty and excellency of virtue, and you knew not the Wiles of Satan, whereby he attempts to hinder men to arrive at it; doubtleſs you ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver enjoy it; he would ſtop you in the way by one means or other. So that I judge it more neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that you know the Malice of the Devil, and the power he hath over men, when he is unknown to them, than to teach you the Deepeſt Myſteries of Divinity. For all ſciences together could not make you holy; but the Malice of the Devil ſhould lead you to Damnation if you knew it not.</p>
            <p>Therefore, I pray you to apply diligently your ſpirit to comprehend, that all ſorts of Evil come from the Devil; as all ſorts of Good comes from God. There is only theſe two things that are good and evil. So that whatſoever is good, in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or on Earth in all the Creatures, in every place, proceeds immediately from God: and all that is evil in every thing, comes from the Devil. For he being by his ſin ſeparated from God, is fallen into all evils: There is no good but in God alone; and in the privation of good conſiſts all evil. All that is infallible.</p>
            <p>Evil then is no real thing, and God never gave it a being, but all good things come ever from God; whence it follows, that the privation of all good, is all evil. So that, the Devil being ſeperated from God, (who is all good) is conſequently fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all evil, which is nothing elſe but a privation of all good. That miſerable Nothing is the Devil, who by his free will would ſeparate himſelf from all good: and it is that ſeparation which makes all evil. There can be no other evil, but the want
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:65025:77"/>
and deprival of all good, ſeeing God never crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Evil. Now nothing can have a being, but what God created; and having never created evil, it cannot be other thing, but a curſed Nothing; which we call evil. And that evil is in its eſſence in the Devil, as Good is in God, without mixture: for there can be no Evil in God; and there can be no Good in the Devil.</p>
            <p>But we find a mixture in the other Creatures, which have partaken of Good from God, and evil from the Devil; and ſo they can be mixed of theſe two things: and are good or evil in proportion as they partake of the one or the other. God gave unto man all ſorts of Goods in aboundance, ſince he had the power to give them. And the devil (that impotence) hath given nothing to man, but ſo much evil, as he hath obtained conſent from the free will of man, and no more: for he is nothing but miſerable impotence.</p>
            <p>And to know, that the Malice of the Devil, and the Sin of Man, are but nothings, you need but conſider, what we ſee and touch in nature. For we ſee aſſuredly that Hunger and Thirſt, is but the want of Meat and Drink; Cold is but the privation of Heat, and Death the privation of life; and ſo is it with all other ſorts of evils, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal man; which are only the privation of the Goods which he needs for his ſuſtenance, temporal and eternal.</p>
            <p>For, though we ſay, that there are in Hell, pains and Torments, Fire, Ice, Sadneſs, Bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and all ſorts of Pains. All theſe are nothing in effect but the privation of the goods, which man ſhould have had, to be happy, <hi>viz.</hi> all ſorts of Contentments in God, all Pleaſure, all Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and Delight, Refreſhment, Peace and Joy
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:65025:78"/>
eternal. But the privation of all theſe things, makes the Torments and Sufferings of Hell; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out need that there ſhould be material Fire, Ice, or Famin. It is enough, that the ſoul of man be deprived of all good, to ſuffer all ſorts of evil. We may ſee that yet more clearly in a new born Infant, if it be left without the good of aſſiſtance, it is reduced to all ſorts of evil, and will die, without our touching it, to do it any evil; for we deprive it of life in depriving it of aſſiſtance. It is the ſame with the malice of the Devil, and the Sin of man. They are only privations of Good, which notwithſtanding cauſe Pains and Torments incomprehenſible to mans ſoul. And all that is repreſented to us by fire, Hunger, and other Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Hell; which is nothing, in regard of the reality of the Pains and Torments, which a ſoul ſuffers that is deprived of the Grace of God.</p>
            <p>For that ſoul is not only fallen into the Cold of Ice, and Heat of Fire, but alſo into all other ſorts of Torments; becauſe the privation of the Grace of God, is the poſſeſſion of all ſorts of evil: and ſeeing that Grace cauſes us all ſorts of Good, its privation muſt needs throw us into all evil.</p>
            <p>Now whatſoever lives in nature, generates al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, becauſe there is in it a bent and inclination to produce its like. Herbs and Plants yield their ſeeds and ſprigs or branches; nothing remains un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful, that lives in nature; every kind produces its like to its power. Beaſts produce after their kinds; men produce human Creatures; ſpirits, ſpirits; every one according to their nature. The good ſpirits, which are the Angels of God, produce always good ſpirits; the evil, which are the Devils, produce evil. The one and th'other of theſe ſpirits, attempt to produce in the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:65025:78"/>
ſouls of men, their own ſort. And as men are the nobleſt of all the Creatures, there is neither Angel nor Devil hath power over him, but ſo far as man gives them. The good Angels always incite men to good: the evil, who are the Devils, to evil. And that by the deſire that each of theſe ſpirits hath, to render men like to themſelves; the Devil endeavours to render the ſouls of men deviliſh, and the good Angels to render them An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical. Man in the mean while remains free to yield himſelf to be begotten unto good, or evil: for none of theſe ſpirits can force man: they can but incite him. Every one attempts to render him of his own party: but ſince the Devil hath corrupted man's nature, he hath alſo more power over it than the good Angel, which hath not advanced it to good as the Devil to evil. All the good in man comes from God only, and not from the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, who being a pure ſpirit, hath not power, but over the ſpirit of man, in repreſenting to him good things: but the Devil, as a ſubtil ſpirit, hath inſinuated himſelf into the ſpirit of man, by means of the human nature. And as the vital ſpirits in man are in his blood diſperſed throw his whole body; ſo does the ſpirit of the Devil mix and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe it ſelf with the vital ſpirits of man; and works much more upon his nature, than the good Angel; who cannot joyn with the corruption of that nature, becauſe he is a ſpirit altogether pure; but the Devil is impure, and accords well with the impurity of our corrupted nature. And therefore he is always more united with us than the good Angel, who does not delight but in the pure ſpirit of man: For he finds nothing conform to his Angelick nature, but the ſpirit of man; becauſe our human nature is too groſs
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:65025:79"/>
and earthly, to be united with the Angelick Nature.</p>
            <p>But the Devil, as an impure Beaſt, wallows freely in the fleſh and blood, that he may gain the ſoul of man. He ſo mixes himſelf with the blood of man, that he eaſily moves all the parts of his body to do evil; but man knows not that it is the Devil: For he is ſo united to corrupt nature, that though we feel his motions, we think that they proceed but from our own nature. Which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe man cannot comprehend, that the Devil ſhould ſo mix with fleſh and blood, ſince he is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Spirit without Body, as he is truely: but the Devil hath that ſubtilty to joyn himſelf to the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſpirits of man, to move the fleſh to Luxury, Wrath, and other vicious Paſſions.</p>
            <p>You may ſee that, my Son, by your proper ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience: For if you mark well the diſpoſition of your ſentiments, you ſhall find that you have been often carryed away with vicious paſſions, even againſt your will; and that you have perceived them with regret, which cannot proceed from your ſelf, for your will cannot contradict it ſelf. If you had naturally a will to the pleaſure of the fleſh, it would not diſpleaſe you, but contrariwiſe you would take pleaſure in it, and be glad that you might effectuate it. But when that carnal thought or deſire diſpleaſes you, and you regret it, that is a token that it comes from a ſpirit which is without you, and yet is in you, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that you know how he is there. Yet you ſee well, by the operations which he does there, that that proceeds not from your own will, which cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire what diſpleaſes it, but it complains with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> where he ſays, <hi>the Good that I would, I do not; and the Evil that I would not, that I do:</hi> and that
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:65025:79"/>
to ſhow us, that there is in us an evil ſpirit, who is the Devil, who often acts in us contrary to our will. Which is but too true, and what every one may experiment in himſelf; provided he will exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min himſelf narrowly. For though the Devil be an inviſible ſpirit, yet he renders himſelf viſible by his operations. And ſince there is no other Evil but the Devil, we muſt conclude, that all the Evils we do againſt our will, proceed from him only.</p>
            <p>For he endeavours always to cauſe us to ſin, and to loſe the grace of God, that he may have us Companions of his miſeries, by cauſing us to loſe all good, which conſiſts in the Grace of God; to cauſe us to fall into all ſorts of Evil, which is the privation of all ſorts of Good. The Devil is in that ſtate, and ſo attempts to beget others mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable as himſelf; and that with as much Care, Labour, and Deſire, as men can beſtow to beget their like.</p>
            <p>Behold the curſed inſtrument which acts always in man, to make him loſe the Grace of God: Which you muſt know (my Son) if you will ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at true Virtue. For if the Devil remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to you, he will gain you by one means or other: it is all one to him, provided he catch men; and he hath divers ſorts of Snares, proper for the condition of every one. He ſpies out the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of every man, that he may attaque him where he is weakeſt.</p>
            <p>When he ſees one addicted to covet the Riches of this world, he will give him proſperity, that he may fix his heart thereon. If that ſucceed, then hath he gained the man; ſeeing his affections can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be unto God, ſo long as as they are in his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. Not that the Devil can give men Riches; for he is but a poor Wretch, who hath nothing
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:65025:80"/>
but miſeries: but he hath power over the minds of many men, whom he moves to labour and give profit to ſuch, as he hopes to gain by addicted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to Riches. So that he brings forth occaſions to make them proſper by his adherents. Now they that know not the Wiles of the Devil, think that it is the Bleſſing of God, when they ſo proſper: The Devil ſo blinds their underſtanding, that they diſcover not even that theſe Proſperities cauſe them to fall into ſeveral ſins. For he that is rich, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ordinarily proud, he exceeds in Pomp, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity Delicious Fare, Idleneſs, Luxury, and divers other Exceſſes, which he could not commit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was rich: So it is eaſie to conjecture, that it could not be by the Bleſſing of God he acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red theſe Riches. But men are at preſent ſo blind in that point, that they attribute to God what the Devil does to draw them to Hell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one by oneway, and another by another; For he is ſo ſubtil that he will be loath to tempt one by things contrary to their inclination. If he ſees one liberal, and that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vets not the Riches of the World, he will make him exceed in Liberality, in giving, prodigueing and neglecting what is neceſſary for himſelf: and ſo he will make him give his Riches to them that will offend God, by what he gives them. And if he ſee another Addicted to Luxury, Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies, or Drunkenneſs, he is often content with ſome of theſe ſins, and lets him do well in other things.</p>
            <p>For it is enough to the Devil, if he hold us bound by one only ſin, wherein we have our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections that is enough to keep us out of the Graces of God; ſeeing we muſt not with-draw our heart, to place it in any thing, but in God alone. Yet the Devil always incites man to do all the evil,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:65025:80"/>
he can: But there are many, who would not give themſelves to many Vices, though they be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to ſome one: Such ſorts of perſons are not much moleſted by tentations of the Devil; but he lets them reſt quietly in the ſin to which he ſees them moſt addicted, without tempting them by others. When then he hath no hope to carry men to greater Evils, he contents himſelf to keep their ſouls faſt by one Chain until Death, that he may after drag them to hell with him. The miſery is, that men will not be aware; for they that are not addicted to many ſins have always hopes of their ſalvation. <hi>I confeſs,</hi> ſays one, <hi>I'm enclined to Luxury; but I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow much on the poor, and will wrong no man.</hi> Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſays, <hi>It is true, I'm given to Drinking; but I am kind and obliging to my neighbour.</hi> A third, <hi>It's true, I love Riches, and Honours; but I alſo attend the Service of God, I go frequently to Church, and to Solemnities and Devotions.</hi> A fourth ſays, <hi>I'm given to feeding and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy; but I hate no perſon.</hi> And ſo with a thouſand Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes they think to evite damnation, and to abtain ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, while they are not addicted to many Vices and Sins.</p>
            <p>But the Devil, derides all theſe Excuſes; he would have of all ſorts of perſons in Hell: them that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit more ſorts of ſins, and thoſe alſo that are addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to one or two ſorts. For there are in Hell all ſorts of ſtates and degrees, even as there is in the world: where one is of higher condition than another. Thoſe that have here committed more ſins, ſhall be in greater damnation in Hell, than others. I pray God deliver you from that unhappineſs, and remain</p>

For the corruption of nature comes from the Devil, and we need but follow it to become little Devils: as if we but follow the Light of God, we ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come little Gods: for the good ſpirit and the evil alſo beget always their like when joyned and united to the ſoul of man. They produce always fruits of their own nature. When man's will then joyns with the Corrruption of his Nature, it needs
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:65025:81"/>
no other Devil from without to tempt it; having in it ſelf that little Devil of Corruption, which the great one hath engendered there. And when it obeys that Corruption, it obeys the Devil him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: For the Corruption of Nature and the malice of the Devil are the ſame thing, even as a man's Child is another man. Men are groſly ignorant in that they think they are not tempted of the Devil, when they do not feel in themſelves pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-natural evils: and they call the Malice of their Nature, a Fragility, without having ever ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conſidered, whence that natural wickedneſs comes to them.</p>
            <p>God never created evil; but he made man alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether perfect, and with an inclination and will to Good, without knowing any thing of evil: and therefore of neceſſity the wickedneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to evil, which man feels in his nature, muſt come from the Devil: and it ſelf may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Devil, ſeeing there is no other evil but him, as there is no other good but God. So that they that follow the inclinations of their corrupt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, march quietly to eternal Damnation. And the Devil does not drive ſuch with tentations; but ſtands afar off to ſee them go on, knowing well, that they ſhall become dayly worſe, if they but follow ſimply the inclinations of their corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>Which few are aware of; but they will find themſelves deceived at Death; for during their life they think it is no evil, to follow their natural inclinations: <hi>yea,</hi> ſay ſome, <hi>God created Nature, and cannot be offended that we follow it.</hi> That is one of the greateſt Tentations, and is a ſentiment which opens a door to all ſorts of evils. It is true, God created nature, and wills that man uſe it; but
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:65025:82"/>
the Devil hath ſo corrupted Nature that man can no more uſe and follow it without ſinning, ſince it is corrupted. Man cannot even do any natural function now, without ſinning againſt God; and that as long as he hath not overcome the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his nature. For if the natural man eat and drink, he does it with affection: now that affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ought to be carryed to God alone; ſo he ſins, when he turns it elſewhere: and when he gives his affection to ſee, hear, ſmell, taſte, or feel; he loves ſomething elſe than God. But he ought to love him with all his heart, and not place his affections on other things, beſide him alone: and ſo long as man puts his affection on eating, drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, cloathing or lying, &amp;c. he is turned from all good, which is God, and turned to all evil, which is the privation of all good. It is the ſame if we love our Riches, Honours, and Pleaſures; for we are turned from God, unto the love of our ſelves; when we love the Pleaſures of the fleſh, and not thoſe of the ſpirit; and that exchange of affection cauſes us to fall into all evil, ſeeing it deprives us of all good.</p>
            <p>If then we will depart from all evil, and poſſeſs all good, we muſt of neceſſity reſiſt and overcome the inclinations of corrupt nature: otherwiſe we ſhall inſenſibly fall into all ſorts of ſin. For it is enough to carry us to Hell, to follow corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>And therefore (my Son) you muſt die to your ſelf firſt, if you would arrive at true Virtue: ſeeing as long as corrupt nature is not entirely mortified in you, you cannot live in the ſpirit of Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe for that you muſt become a new creature, and deteſt that old corruption, which the Devil hath intruded into the Works of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:65025:82"/>
God; for its that is our Enemy, and cauſes us all ſorts of Evil. Notwithſtanding the ignorant think it a happineſs when they can follow their natural inclinations, although it is in effect the ſource of all Evils. Which you may well ſee, by the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which I have formerly deduced. For although God hath created Nature, and ordained that it ſhould be ſuſtained, by aliments, and alſo re-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it ſelf by generation: yet he would always have the Heart and Affections of man to himſelf entirely, without parting.</p>
            <p>God willingly permits that man eat, and drink and generate, and uſe his five natural Senſes for his neceſſity: but he will alſo that we place not our Affections and Heart on theſe, which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires to be preſerved for himſelf only indiviſibly. We may then well uſe all theſe things, but not faſten our heart on'em.</p>
            <p>For when in the beginning man was created in Grace, he did eat, drink, generate, and uſe his five natural ſenſes: becauſe he could do all that with thankſgiving to God. When he taſted of good things, he praiſed God, who had made them ſo ſavoury for him: when he ſaw beautiful things, he praiſed their Author in admiring thoſe Beauties. If he ſmelled good Odours, or heard pleaſant Melody, or touched ſmooth and pleaſant things; he rejoiced in God, bleſſing him, in that he had not only given him the things neceſſary for entertaining his life, but alſo for Pleaſure and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. All theſe things then ſerved man only to bleſs their Creator, and glorifie him in his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And man deſired not Generation, but to encreaſe the Praiſes and thankſgiving which they owed unto God.</p>
            <p>Behold how man uſed all theſe things well, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:65025:83"/>
the devil had corrupted his Nature: but ſince he is turned from God to carry his affections to himſelf, as he does at preſent; he deſires not genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but for his own ſatisfaction, and not for aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting the Glory of God, but to wallow in concupiſcence; for they have more inclination to enjoy the Pleaſures of the Fleſh, than to produce Children to glorifie God. And when men enjoy the pleaſures of their ſenſes, and uſe the beautiful and good creatures, it is more to ſatisfie themſelves, than to bleſs and magnifie God, who gives them: So eſteeming more the gift than the giver.</p>
            <p>From all which we ſee, that what ſerved unto man for bleſſing, when he was in Grace, ſerves now as a means of ſinning, and loſing the Grace of God. Yet we find men ſo blinded with ſelf-love, that they perſwade themſelves, they can ſee, hear, ſmell, taſte, and feel, all that is good and pleaſant, and praiſe God in the mean while: which is but falſhood. For ſince man's Nature was corrupted, it no more refers any thing to God; but in all theſe things pleaſes it ſelf; and uſes them as if it were worthy of them, as it was before ſin. But that is a groſs Error; for corrupt nature cannot ſeek the Glory of God; it ſeeks only its own, and hath no intention to bleſs and praiſe God for what it poſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. This deſire of ſatisfying the five ſenſes, is common to all that live according to corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, none excepted.</p>
            <p>Therefore thoſe that ſay, that <hi>they know to uſe good and pleaſant things, in praiſing God,</hi> do but flatter themſelves. For, to do that, they muſt have overcome corrupt nature: which they have not yet done, ſince we ſee them ſearch after good and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant things for their ſatisfaction. But if they had overcome corrupt Nature, they would no more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:65025:83"/>
it in any thing; For that corruption is never ſo mortified in this life, but it would ſoon revive, if they granted to their nature eaſes and pleaſures.</p>
            <p>But the ſoul that is regenerated in Jeſus Chriſt, knows well, that Nature muſt be kept under ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection and reſtraint, during this ſhort life, which is a time of penitence; where we muſt ſuffer, if we will enjoy after. Which ſhews, that thoſe, who ſay, <hi>they may enjoy all beautiful and good things here, praiſing God</hi>; are very ignorant, and deceived by the Devil. For they think themſelves to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated in the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt; which is falſe: ſeeing his Spirit doth not teach that we ſhould taſte the Pleaſures of this life, and uſe all that's good and pleaſant: But he teaches penitence, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing our ſelves; to be poor in Spirit; to forſake all that we have; to watch and be ſober. All that is not to enjoy whatever is good and pleaſant. For Jeſus Chriſt teaches to take the leaſt, and to chooſe the loweſt place. If then theſe perſons, had but attained however little of the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, they would be far from ſaying, that <hi>they have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome the corruption of their nature, and are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> while they do things quite contrary to what he did and taught.</p>
            <p>For if it were permitted to the Regenerate, to take their pleaſure, and to enjoy whatever is good and pleaſant in nature; doubtleſs Jeſus Chriſt would have done ſo: ſeeing there was never any perſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated, and had overcome the corruption of Nature, ſo perfectly as he: And yet he ſpeaks of nothing but <hi>ſuffering, becoming poor, bearing the Croſs, and denying our ſelves:</hi> Theſe imprudents muſt think themſelves more perfect than he, ſeeing they ſay, <hi>they may well taſte all what is good and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant in nature, provided they thank God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:65025:84"/>Notwithſtanding our Lord deprived himſelf of all theſe things, to give us example. Do you not ſee, my Son, that it is a cunning device of Satan, to deceive them that aſpire unto Virtue? For he fills their Spirit with preſumption aſſoon as he hath got them to digeſt ſome curious ſpeculations of the ſpiritual life. They imagin that they are already regenerated in the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, although they live altogether according to the corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the old <hi>Adam.</hi> Such perſons are very far from true Virtue: And it is to be feared, that they ſhall never arrive at it, ſeeing they think themſelves in it already; but they are far from it, and they had better never have begun to be virtuous, than to take up falſe Virtues. Theſe ſins are worſe than others becauſe of their Hypocriſie. They think themſelves virtuous, and they are yet full of Vices and Sins. I deſpair more of theſe apparent devout perſons than of the perſons of the World, who have any Fear of God; for they have the beginning of Virtue; which th'others have not, who cannot fear God, believing themſelves regenerated in the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt. They fancy themſelves to be in Aſſurance, and they are in the midſt of Perils and Dangers of loſing their ſouls, by Preſumption, and the Deluſion of the Devil, who attempts always to turn aſide them that deſire to follow true virtue.</p>
            <p>He firſt by ſome inward Conſolation and ſweetneſs endeavours to fix them on it by ſelf-love; for corrupt nature loves to be comforted. But the new Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner no ſooner takes his pleaſure in theſe ſenſible Sweetneſs and Conſolations, but he falls. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, that he will not mind his duty in reſiſting the corruption of his nature, when he is faſtned to theſe ſenſibilities: But will think he hath already over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come it, when he feels delight, and conſolation in
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:65025:84"/>
Spiritual things; whereas before he felt none, but in natural things: And that makes him believe that he is already at the height of Perfection, though he be not yet at the firſt degree; which is the Tears of Penitence, and regret for offending God, and the deſire to walk henceforth in his Fear, which is the beginning of all Virtue.</p>
            <p>But the Devil diverts that Fear, and perſwades them, <hi>that they are already virtuous, becauſe they deſire to become ſo.</hi> And ſo does the Devil amuſe thoſe that begin; and he would willingly keep them all their life with Sweetneſs &amp; inward Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, which the Devil can give, and alſo man's own Nature. For as ſoon as they with-draw from the Vanity of the World, they find great quiet; ſince it is a Slavery to ſerve the World. There they torture and rack their underſtanding by care to maintain themſelves well in honour and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to be well cloathed and adorned, and to be followed and eſteemed. What Diligence muſt not a Worldly Perſon uſe to pleaſe men? What Fear of incurring Diſgraces? How muſt he diſſemble, and ſuffer to have mens Favour and keep it? How much toil to gain ſufficiently to maintain him ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably? What Device and Cunning muſt he uſe to get Eſteem, and to avoid Contempt? In fine, he that ſerves the World, hath nothing but toil and diſquiet: but he that hath reſolved to quit it, to ſerve God, begins to be looſed from the weighty yoak of pleaſing the World, and to find himſelf in much more quiet and contentment. Which is pleaſant to nature; but if it pleaſe and fix it ſelf upon theſe Pleaſures, it will not advance in Virtue; but live in ſelf-love, inſtead of the love of God; And in that the Devil forwards Nature mightily, in augmenting theſe ſweetneſſes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:65025:85"/>
Conſolations, to fix the perſon the more to them.</p>
            <p>God beſtows alſo Sweetneſs and conſolations upon them that begin, to draw them the more eaſily from Earthly Affections, to the Love of himſelf, by ſenſible Conſolations, which the ſoul finds in his ſervice. But whenceſoever they come, we muſt never reſt thereon, nor take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in any thing, that is not God: For all Sin came into the World by man's loving the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and taking his pleaſure in them. And when we take pleaſure in Inward Conſolation, we turn from God, in loving that ſenſibility: It is permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to feel and perceive them, ſince God gives them ſometimes, but we cannot addict our ſelves to them, without ſinning, no more than to other things beſide God: For our whole heart ought to be employed in the Love of God only.</p>
            <p>I know well the Devil attempts to turn us from that Love by all ſorts of occaſions; and he no ſooner ſees one retire from the Love of the World, Riches, Honours and Pleaſures; but he attacques them by the affection of Virtue, and inward conſolations, to with-draw their Hearts thereby from that pure Love of God. Be then upon your guard, my Son, leſt the Devil enſnare you, under pretext of Virtue: Which Care ſhe wiſheth you, who remains,</p>

               <p>To the ſame; to whom is diſcovered a fifth and ſixth Artifice of the Devil, by which he cauſeth men to apply themſelves to the knowledge of the Truth, and Myſterial and Spiritual things; to the end that <hi>(5)</hi> they may comprehend them, or <hi>(6)</hi> that they may unſeaſonably inſtruct others.</p>
            </argument>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Son;</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have not yet expoſed to you all the Wiles and Devices of the Devil; as it is impoſſible for me to diſcover them all: but I ſhall yet tell you of more, which I have experimented my ſelf, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſuch as I have ſeen in others.</p>
            <p>You muſt then know, in what manner he treats with ſpiritual perſons; otherwiſe he might ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce you without your knowing it; and you ſhould ſometimes take for Operations of God, what were Operations of the Devil. For he transforms him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into an Angel of Light, and does in us almoſt the ſame things which the Spirit of God does; he gives light to our underſtanding, and makes it conceive myſtical things and deep divine myſteries; for having been an Angel of God, he knew his will, but did not put it in practice. He attempts to cauſe men to do the very ſame. He does not hinder them to read myſtical things, and to take pleaſure in them, while they are in themſelves beautiful and pleaſant. He gives alſo curioſity to
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:65025:86"/>
deſire to underſtand them, that they may be able to ſpeak well of them: but he hinders with all his might, that they ſhould bring them into practice. For he knows well that it is written, that <hi>he that knew the Will of his Father and did it not, ſhould be beaten with many ſtripes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Malice is ſo great, that it is his ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to ſee man in the greateſt miſeries; and the deeper he ſees man precipitated in Damnation, the more he rejoiceth; and for that is it he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites always to do more Evil: and knowing that it is a greater Evil to know myſtical things, and not practiſe them; than to be ignorant of them, or unable to know them: He gives light to the man's underſtanding, to make him underſtand and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend well theſe divine things, and ſo much the more as he reaps his advantage; ſeeing he that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands nothing of theſe, will be always more humble, than he that does underſtand them well. For he boaſts and glories without reaſon; but the other fears God becauſe of his Ignorance, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts himſelf unworthy to receive his Graces while he can ſay nothing in divine things: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the other, becauſe he can, thinks himſelf a Saint.</p>
            <p>I have known ſeveral in that ſtate, whom I could not help, becauſe they thought themſelves wiſer than me in myſtical things: Yea, I have ſeen clearly that the Devil teaches myſtical things. For divers Sorcerers have told me, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil taught them divine things, and catechized them even as a Miſſionary: and I found in effect that they underſtood as much of divinity as ſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines who have ſtudyed in it all their life.</p>
            <p>I knew in particular one man, who ſpoke as Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely as an Angel of Heaven could; and when
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:65025:86"/>
I heard him at firſt, I thought to have found ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſelf, and remained ſeveral years in that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. For I had never heard any ſpeak ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundly of the internal and myſtique Life, as him: but at length he diſcovered to me that all was but Hypocriſie. Which I could hardly believe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the good Opinion I had conceived of him, and his inward diſpoſition: So I asked him, <hi>where he had learnt thoſe profound Secrets of the inward and myſtique Life, ſeeing he had not ſtudied, nor under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood Latin?</hi> He anſwered <hi>That he had an Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be eſteemed of men; and to effect it, he had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Birth nor money, being a poor countreymans</hi> Son, <hi>but ſeeing that Virtue was eſteemed among Perſons of Virtue and Honour, he conceived that by learning it, he ſhould be eſteemed of ſuch perſons</hi>; which did alſo ſucceed to him. For every one eſteemed him as a Saint, as he had in his Diſcourſe and outward Comportment the appearance of it. He was Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt; walked among men without regarding them; he was always the firſt at Church on days of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities, and Devotions; he gave liberally to the Poor; and ſometimes put off the Cloaths of his own body, to cover ſome miſerable Body he ſaw Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, becauſe he had no ſubſtance to give them Money; He ate and drank ſoberly; ſincere and true in his words; ſhewed to be in continual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God. And with all theſe fine appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Virtues, he was by compact joyned to the Devil; as he confeſſed ſeveral times himſelf at the end of his life; and died enraged, renouncing God, and calling upon the Devils, of whom he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained becauſe of the Torments they cauſed him to ſuffer.</p>
            <p>Behold how men deceive themſelves, in belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them to be virtuous, who can ſpeak well of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:65025:87"/>
Virtue: and the Devil himſelf teaches his Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to talk well. For that man told me, that <hi>the Devil incited him to buy ſeveral good Books, as</hi> Taulerus, Cantſvelt, Johannes a Cruce, <hi>and other good myſtique Authors; that by reading them, and retaining what he read, he might ſpeak like them; and by ſuch diſcourſe be eſteemed one enlightned of God.</hi> Notwithſtanding that Light came from the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; which befalls alſo many others, who are but Beginners in Virtue, even againſt their intention, and without that they perceive it; and that, to ſtay them in theſe Lights, and pleaſant Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Divine things.</p>
            <p>Therefore (my Son) be never curious to know much, nor that you may be able to talk well of Virtue: but be careful to practiſe well what you know. For God will call you to an accompt of it: Seeing <hi>much ſhall be required of him to whom much is given.</hi> Be faithful to the firſt light God gives you; and he ſhall give you more afterward. Go not out of your ſelf to communicate it to others, before you have put it in practice your ſelf.</p>
            <p>The Devil uſes alſo that deceit, and thereby turns away many from following true virtue: For he gives them at the beginning a certain fervour and deſire to convert all the World. And that aſſoon as they have in themſelves any ſenſible joy and ſweetneſs, or have received ſome particular Light from God, or have taken the reſolution to abandon the World to ſerve God; they would gladly impart all that to others, before they have received ſufficiently themſelves; and by that means the Devil diſtracts their minds, and makes the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle they had to vaniſh, without any profit arriving to others. It is of ſuch perſons, the Scripture ſays, that they <hi>riſe too early in the morning.</hi> For they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:65025:87"/>
give true Virtue to others, while they have it not themſelves. And ſo all goes away in words and diſtractions: and in the end themſelves remain with empty ſouls, from which by little and little is diſpelled all the humour they had taſted of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. They think to do good to others, and they profit no perſon, but loſe their time unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably.</p>
            <p>Be aware of this Deceit, my Son, and go not out from your own heart before you be ſent. There are enough, who make it their trade to Teach others: but very few that teach themſelves. If it come that you have ſome Grace from God, keep it hid until it be God's will that you ſhould diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it: otherwiſe you put your ſelf in peril of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting ſeveral ſins, while you ſhall not perceive it. For there can eaſily ſlip into your heart ſome Vain-glory, when you have received any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Grace: and even when you have only the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of forſaking the World, the better to ſerve God; that can give you to eſteem your ſelf more than another: heware alſo of publiſhing it, before you have done it. It is beſt to do, and be ſilent: for to ſpeak of theſe things, gives ſatisfaction to your nature; for it is much pleaſed to ſpeak of good things; ſo it is beſt not to give it matter of vain complacency; but to ſuffer the good Seed which God hath caſt into your Soul to ſpring up ſecretly, until it bud, and ſend forth branches out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, ſpringing from the root within; and in the end bear fruit; whereof every one may gather with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out your loſs or hurt.</p>
            <p>Which will come, when you have overcome all human conſiderations, and Vain-glory; and then ſhall true Virtue appear ſufficiently in all your works, without needing to make your trade to
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:65025:88"/>
teach others. Then ſhall your actions teach them: and works are much more effectual Sermons, than Words. For it happens often, that <hi>they that ſpeak well, do evil.</hi> And for that words effect nothing in the Souls of others, though good, unleſs they know that theſe words come from his heart that pronounces them: and then they have more force to work in the Souls of others: but to ſpeak of divine things and of Virtue, without the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of them, is as tinkling Braſs ſounding, or as a Perroquet that ſpeaks without reaſon: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, the uſeleſneſs of theſe words to others, they endanger their own ſoul by Vain-glory.</p>
            <p>For the Ignorant eſteem for Virtue, virtuous words, and praiſe them, as if it were reality; though they be not at all eſtimable; for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil himſelf can ſpeak well of divine things, as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times perſons whom he poſſeſſed have ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me.</p>
            <p>I heard a Story, how one time the Devil took the form of a Human Body, and a Religious Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, and in that equipage came and preſented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to a Monaſtery, where there was kept a great Solemnity: and becauſe of the Feaſt, a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of people. Now the preacher of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent fell ſuddainly ſick; whereat the Prior was much vexed, having no perſon to preach; but at that inſtant it was that the Devil came in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Habit and knokt at the Gate, and <hi>asked liberty to lodge in the Convent:</hi> and when he preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelf before the Prior, to have his Bleſſing (as do ordinarily the Religious Strangers) he askt the <hi>reaſon of his ſadneſs?</hi> Who anſwered, <hi>It was becauſe of the ſuddain ſickneſs befallen the Preacher, that was to preach at that hour</hi>; and <hi>that he feared the Murmur and Scandal which that might cauſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:65025:88"/>
               <hi>there was no Preacher to ſupply the want.</hi> The Devil anſwered, <hi>That he would willingly make the Sermon:</hi> which rejoyced much the Prior, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God had ſent him that Miniſter in his Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. The Devil then going up unto the Chair, preached ſo powerfully and ſo wiſely, of the <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God,</hi> of the <hi>State of the Bleſſed,</hi> and <hi>that of the Damned,</hi> that moſt of the Hearers wept with compunction, and were aſtoniſhed to hear ſo clear a deduction of all theſe things.</p>
            <p>But a ſimple Religious Perſon of that <hi>Convent</hi> had a Revelation from God, that it was the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; whereof he advertiſed the prior, who having ended his Functions, cauſed the preacher to come before him, and <hi>conjured him by God, to tell who he was.</hi> He anſwered, <hi>that he was the Devil.</hi> The prior askt, <hi>how it was poſſible, that he could preach ſo beautiful Truths, and ſo profitable for the ſalvation of Souls.</hi> To which he anſwered; <hi>I reap my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by that; for thoſe that have heard me ſpeak theſe Truths, can find no more cloak of ignorance. I have declared to them the State of the Bleſſed and that of the Miſerable, and the juſt judgments of God: and they were all moved. But they are ſo addicted to ſelf-love and the love of earthly things, that they will not put into practice what I have taught them: but on the contrary. will follow their old Cuſtoms, and forget the Truths which I have preached to them:</hi> and after that he vaniſht like ſmoak, in preſence of the Prior, and ſome other of the Religious; leaving a noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Stink behind him.</p>
            <p>This hiſtory ſhews enough, that the Devil can well ſpeak the truth, and good things, when he ſees he can make his advantage of it; and therefore ſhould we not eſteem it a Virtue to be able to talk well of good things? Virtue conſiſts only in
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:65025:89"/>
the practice: and ſo imagin not, that you ſhall do well to ſtudy much, that you may ſpeak ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagiouſly of Virtue: that would be but Vanity without Profit.</p>
            <p>But endeavour to ſtudy well the knowledge of true Virtue, to the end you may put it into pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice; and your practice ſhall teach others. Never read any thing to learn to talk well: but read the Books which teach the practice of Virtue: ſuch as is that of <hi>Thomas a Kempis,</hi> or other ſuch like. For the high and difficult queſtions cannot make you holy: but will inſpire your heart with Vanity and Pride.</p>
            <p>Now, ſeeing we ought to evite even the ſhadow of evil, we muſt conſequently beware of reading Unprofitable things, or elevating matters of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie and hidden Myſteries; ſeeing all theſe things do no more but fill our Spirit with wind, not bringing any profit to the ſoul, but much hurt. For as a Veſſel filled with ſome liquor; cannot receive any other thing, without mixing with what is in it or ſpilling it over; It is the ſame with our underſtanding, when it is repleniſhed with curious ſtudies of whatever matter: For then the light of the Holy Spirit cannot be poured into it pure. It is mixed with our proper thoughts, and ſo there is nothing but confuſion. And in that Confuſion, as in troubled water, the Devil fiſhes, and diſſipates quite that Light.</p>
            <p>And therefore it is that ſo few ſouls receive purely the light of the Holy Spirit. They are not empty; but filled with fine ſpeculations of My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtique things; Others have their minds filled with Medecine; Others with Aſtrology; and ſo of other ſtudies. They cannot comprehend why they ſhould not have the Light of the Holy Spirit, as well as
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:65025:89"/>
ſome other particular ſouls, which they ſee and know to poſſeſs it. But they need not be aſtoniſht at that; for the Holy Spirit cannot enter into a ſoul filled with ſomething elſe: It muſt be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether void of it's own Curioſities, before it can be diſpoſed to receive the wiſdom of the Holy Spirit. It ſhould then deſire to know nothing, beſide what God wills that it ſhould know: and conſequently ſhould not apply it ſelf to read any Book, but ſuch as enlightens the underſtanding in the knowledge of true Virtue. Neither muſt you read theſe things curiouſly, or much at a time; you ſhould pauſe, and conſider what you find there profitable for your ſoul.</p>
            <p>I would not altogether ſtop the curioſity you have, to read my Writings, or thoſe of others, who treat of ſolid Virtue: For that Curioſity is neceſſary at the beginning; for you cannot learn if you be not curious to know. We muſt know before we can love. If then you knew not the Truths which I write, you could not practiſe them. So we may give liberty to that curioſity, to know good things. You muſt not read only to nouriſh, or ſatisfie it: but to learn the truth. You cannot diſcover it too much; though ſome natural ſatisfaction mix it ſelf, it ſhall not hurt you, provided you reſt not on that pleaſure.</p>
            <p>They tell us, <hi>that</hi> Mary Magdalene <hi>went to</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt <hi>becauſe they ſaid to her that he was a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful man, and ſpoke well.</hi> Notwithſtanding that vain curioſity led her to the knowledge of the truth. But after her firſt curioſity vaniſhing, ſhe gave her ſelf to the practice of the Truths which ſhe had heard from him.</p>
            <p>Do you the ſame, My Son. Search curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly the Books which treat of ſolid Virtue; and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:65025:90"/>
neglect no occaſion to find them; ſeeing they ſerve as means to know the will of God; and becauſe God often ſpeaks to the ſoul by the means of a good Book, moving the heart to the affection of eternal things, and contempt of temporal; you muſt only diſcern, whether you read divine things for your own ſatisfaction, or if you do it only to enlighten your ſoul in the knowledge of the Truth of God. If it is for the laſt, there is no evil, that you give your ſelf to long reading. Stay your ſelf only on the matters, which move your heart to the Love of God; without going further, until you have found means to practiſe it well.</p>
            <p>I did that in my young years, when firſt I ſaw the <hi>New Teſtament</hi>; and when I underſtood there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by what a Goſpel Life was, I cloſed the book <hi>for twenty years,</hi> and exerciſed my ſelf to practiſe what is contained in it. And ſo I found the Light of the Holy Spirit, without uſing Books to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct me. In which you may imitate me, when you have ſufficiently read what may avail to the perfection of your ſoul. Which ſhe wiſhes to you, who remains</p>

            <argument>
               <p>To the ſame, Diſcovering to him a ſeventh Wile of the Devil, by which he carries us out of our ſelves; that comparing our works with thoſe of others, we may from our Virtue contract vain-glory. And an Eighth, by which he incites us to immoderate Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and Mortifications of the Body. And fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally a Nineth, in which he excites us to immodera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in ſpiritual good works toward our Neigbour; as unſeaſonably to Inſtruct, Convert, Reprove or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect him.</p>
            </argument>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Son;</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Muſt diſcover to you yet another Device of Satan, by which he does gain ſeveral well en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined perſons, even ſuch as have a good will, who are not only reſolved to labour for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of true Virtue, but would alſo put it in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice. For when he cannnot amuſe them by fine ſpeculations, and curious ſearches to be capable of talking well of ſpiritual things, becauſe they have diſcovered, that to talk well of and underſtand well a Virtue, is but Vanity, when it is not put in practice: and that ſo they have abſolutely reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to fall to the practice, in the exerciſe of good works.</p>
            <p>Then comes he to tempt by virtue it ſelf, and by the practice of good works. He endeavours to intrude Vain-glory upon true Virtue; and ſecretly
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:65025:91"/>
juſtles in Self-eſteem and Contempt of others with good works: None is exempt from that Vanity at the beginning of their converſion. For all men carry in them an inclination to Pride, when they come into the world, and alſo every one muſt combat and oppoſe it, if he would attain to Salvation. But this Pride is harder to be diſcovered, when it furrs it ſelf into Virtue, lurking in the heart without appearing outwardly; as does that which proceeds from plenty of Riches, and the honours which men give. For that Vanity ſhews it ſelf ſufficiently outwardly; for he that is proud of his Riches, will ſhew to the world his Riches and Liberality: by Prodigality in ſeveral things, as in Moveables, Cloaths, Meat, and Drink, willing in every thing the beſt and deareſt, to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his vain-glory; and muſt alſo be ſerved with Pages and Servants. So that his outward Actions diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover ſufficiently the Pride of his Heart: but ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Pride keeps it ſelf hidden even under a cloak of Humility. For we ſee ordinarily beginners in virtue give themſelves to Faſting, Watching and Prayer, to humility in their Cloathes, to ly on hard Beds, and other Macerations of their Body; and alſo to exerciſes of Works of Mercy ſpiritual and corporal.</p>
            <p>Into which the Devil eaſily intrudes himſelf; for if he can gain nothing by vain-glory in our good works, becauſe the man overcomes it by the Grace of God: He attaques us by Exceſſes in them; and moves us to faſt to exceſs, that it may ruin our health or unfit it for neceſſary labour: and to obliege us after to ſubſtantious or delicate food, and ſo precipitate us again into delicacy.</p>
            <p>Lo! how the Devil attempts to ſway us from one extreme to another, and eſpecially him that is not
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:65025:91"/>
well acquainted with his wiles. He hath brought ſome to death by exceſs in faſting, and macera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the body: I know that is rare in the time we live in, when none will embrace penitence, moſt part loving ſenſuality. Yet among the ſmall number of Penitents, the Devil inſinuates himſelf, cauſing them to exceed. For when he can no more make them fall by eaſe and ſenſualities, he does it by exceſs in good Works. And Prayer being the beſt of all, he cauſes them to tye themſelves to a number of vocal Prayers; to over-charge them, and diſquiet them, when they have not time to wait and fulfil theſe ordinary Prayers; which makes the man ſorrowful and diſſatisfied, thinking he does not pleaſe God, when he does not fulfil all his ordinary prayers by cuſtom: and in that thought he is ſad and penſive, and uneaſie to them he converſes with.</p>
            <p>The Devil draws his advantages from exceſs in prayer; for it hurts the head when too vehement, and brings often confuſion in their affairs and hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſholding: I have known Women ſo addicted to their prayers and devotions, that they neglected their families to go to Church frequently at ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities and Devotions; and with all they thought they did well, without diſcovering the cunning of the Devil, who made them ſin inſtead of doing good.</p>
            <p>For God is a God of Order, and not of Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and he ſays expreſly, <hi>that our Prayers ſhould not be as thoſe of the Phariſees, who uſe many words, ſeeing the Lord knows what we have need of before we ask it.</hi> And if we think to gain time for Prayer by watching, the Devil will diſturb our ſpirit, for want of ſufficient ſleep, that he may weaken us, and in ſhort time deſtroy us. I have expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:65025:92"/>
all theſe things, and ſometimes fallen into ſo great extremities, that if God had not marve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly maintained me, I ſhould have been dead long ago, by exceſs in faſting, watching, and lying hard; which God hath ſince ſhewen me to be but a diſorderly fervour, which cannot be long continued; and that the Devil finds his advantages in it, and eaſily inſinuates therein thoughts of vain-glory; becauſe they think themſelves better than others, while they uſe theſe mortifications of the body, though they be no more, but means to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie our Intemperances and Luxury. For if we were well diſpoſed, we ſhould not need Watchings, Faſtings, and other Macerations of the body. It is not our Fleſh that can ſin, but the will only, which we muſt compel more to do well than our fleſh: ſeeing this is but as a Horſe which ought not to be whipt when he rides willingly; which he does as well covered with a Sadle of Leather, as with one of Velvet; and contrariwiſe. Even ſo our Heart may be as virtuous, when our Body is covered with velvet as when with Leather: ſeeing the outward habit brings nothing to the Soul. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, a ſimple habit covers often Hypocriſie, and cauſes pride in the Heart. And therefore we muſt never be tyed to theſe outward things; for the Devil thereby finds opportunity. But we muſt be tyed to God alone, on whom the Devil hath no power; as he hath on all our outward actions, even the beſt.</p>
            <p>For the Devil furrs himſelf into works of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Mercy and Charity; he perſwades us, that it is well done to inſtruct the Ignorant, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh the faulty; which in effect profits no more in this miſerable time, when men periſh not by Ignorance, but by pure malice. For every one
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:65025:92"/>
would profeſs to teach virtue, and very few will practice it. I exerciſed my ſelf about nine years in teaching of the ignorant, without profiting any thing in the ſalvation of their Souls. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, I had the diſſatisfaction to hear ſome of them ſay, to whom I had ſhewn the Chriſtian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Virtue, <hi>That they could now do greater Evils, than they could do before; becauſe now they could cover their wickedneſſes with feigned Virtues, which they could not do before they learn't to talk of Virtue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So it is not adviſable that we diſtract our ſelves to go and teach others, unleſs we ſee that our teaching will be profitable to their Salvation whom we would teach: and we muſt uſe in this great diſcretion, otherwiſe the Devil vould amuſe us all our life in teaching the Ignorant, thinking we did a work of ſpiritual Mercy, which yet ſhould be no profit to others, and much hurt to our ſelves. We muſt indee<gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ave Charity to teach our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; but not exceed therein, nor have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreet Zeal toward ſuch as ſearch not after the Salvation or Perfection of their Souls themſelves. For the Devil himſelf would feign ignorance, and deſire of us inſtruction, to diſtract us from our own perfection. I have known perſons poſſeſſed of the Devil, who went continually ſearching pious Souls, to be inſtructed in Chriſtian Perfection. Theſe are ſuch as the ſcripture calls <hi>ſilly Women, ever lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and never come to the knowledge of the Truth.</hi> For they care not to put it in practice, although they knew it; but ſeek only to amuſe us, and cauſe good perſons to loſe their time, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not advance in Virtue while they are attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in vain to procure it to others.</p>
            <p>There is the profit the Devil draws from works of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ritual
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:65025:93"/>
Mercy, both in inſtructing Ignorants and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhing the Faulty: for ſo evil is our time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, that we can no more reſiſt the evil; it is enough to endure and ſuffer it with regret. If you ſhould ſpeak to admoniſh men for their Oaths, Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, Robberies, Lies, and Infidelities, and other groſs Sins; they would leap in your face, curſe you, deſpiſe you, calumniate and hate you. So that inſtead of doing them any work of Mercy, you ſhould excite them to greater ſins, and put your ſelf in danger of being abuſed and perſecuted, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any profit. As I have known perſons zealous for the Glory of God, who could not ſuffer the wicked in their preſence; and reproved their Vices, and admoniſhed them upon occaſions; And theſe have often run the hazard of being killed by them they admoniſht; the Devil attempting ſo to extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate them.</p>
            <p>Which alſo happened to one of my Friends, who was <hi>Poiſoned</hi> for being over-zea<gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap> for the Glory of God, and over-fervent in oppoſing Evil: And therefore we muſt in all things uſe diſcretion, if we would evite the ſnares, which the Devil ſpreads every where, to catch ſouls. Yet we muſt not therefore neglect to inſtruct the Ignorant, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh the Faulty, when we find perſons diſpoſed to profit thereby. Yea, we muſt have in our heart the Charity of St. <hi>Paul, who wished to be accurſed for his brethrens Salvation.</hi> Which appears to be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Zeal; but it proceeded from the Charity of his Heart toward his Neighbour, and forgetting of himſelf: For he regarded more the Glory of God than his own Salvation or Advantage, ſeeing he was but one perſon to glorify God, and his brethren a great number.</p>
            <p>So that exceſs could not come of the Devil, ſeeing
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:65025:93"/>
he had no intereſt or profit by it. He knows that God does the will of them that he loves, and ſo he might foreſee, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> would obtain the Prayer which he made for his Brethren; He knew alſo that God would not damn St. <hi>Paul</hi> for his great Charity which he carryed to his Brethren, offering his own Salvation that they might be ſaved. He could have no extrance there, ſeeing Charity is God himſelf, on whom the Devil hath no power: but he hath much over all our external actions, when they are done without diſcretion. Therefore was it St. <hi>Anthony</hi> ſaid, <hi>Diſcretion is the greateſt of all Virtues</hi>; ſeeing they are diſorderly when not regulated with Diſcretion: For Faſtings, Watchings, Prayers and Works of Mercy, and other Virtues, are not good when Diſcretion is wanting. It is good to admoniſh and inſtruct our Neighbour in a fit ſeaſon, and when he deſires it; but when he does not ſeek it, or will not ſuffer it, we muſt withdraw teſtifying that their imperfections and ſins diſpleaſe us, without going to correct or reſtrain them authoritatively. For God hath not given us our Brother in charge; he is left free as well as we: ſo we ought not to help him but by Charity as far as he hath need, and deſires it; not farther.</p>
            <p>God does equally the ſame with all men; he pleaſed to have them free, and ſo conſtrains them in nothing. Now we muſt not preſume to be more juſt or charitable than God, in willing to obliege our Neighbour to do well by force, and forſake his Sins and Vices, if he does not of himſelf entreat us to counſel and admoniſh him, when he fails.</p>
            <p>For one man ought never to go to compel an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other in what regards his perfection, ſince God hath created us free, and will not that we ſhould be Slaves; but wills that our ſouls ſhould be his Spouſes,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:65025:94"/>
to yield themſelves voluntarily to his Love: But all Conſtraint is Slavery: So we muſt never uſe raſhneſs to force men to do well, or conſtrain him to forſake his ſins. God will have us free during the time of our tryal, which is this ſhort life. And it is the Pride and Preſumption of our ſelves, to go to inſtruct or correct our Neighbour by authority; who is ſometimes better before God than our ſelves, though he have not ſo many moral Virtues, or outward Appearance of Good: which we often learn and obſerve, that we may be agreeable to men; who deſpiſe always what is reprehenſible be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. That is the reaſon of politique perſons abſtaining eaſily from groſs and external ſins, that they may appear good; which is often leſs virtue, than that of ſuch as ſpeak rudely, and commit open evil. The beſt is to teach and preach to our ſelves, and to have Piety and Charity for others, when we think they do evil, and we cannot hinder them. It belongs to Judges to repreſs external Malifices, to preſerve good Policy.</p>
            <p>But you, who are a free perſon, take not the charge of others, but labour to learn well true Virtue, and to put it in practice: for the Devil cannot deceive you there; as he can eaſily in the exerciſe of external Works of Mercy bodily or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, which you would do: but he inſinuates himſelf more eaſily in the bodily, than ſpiritual, being more ſenſible and viſible, and ſo more praiſed and applauded of men; who eſteem nothing more than liberality. When then they ſee one that <hi>feeds the hungry, gives drink to the thirſty, cloaths the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, lodges ſtrangers, viſits the ſick and buries the dead:</hi> They hold him for a Saint. But it is rare to find ſuch now adays, in the miſerable age wherein we live. For generally men are filled with Avarice
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:65025:94"/>
and Covetouſneſs; and ſeek only their own proper intereſts, without troubling themſelves with the neceſſities of their Neighbour. Charity is cold in mens hearts, and they eſteem him virtuous, who gives a little out of his ſuperfluities to the poor, or does any other outward merciful work.</p>
            <p>Now the Devil eaſily furrs himſelf into all theſe things; and if we diſcover not his ſubtilties, we may do many works of corporal mercy which ſhall turn to his honour. For he that does theſe things to be eſteemed of men, is a Hypocrite, as were the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> to whom Jeſus Chriſt ſo often up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided their Vice: They did truely many works of mercy ſpiritual and corporal; but thoſe did not ſave them. For Jeſus Chriſt deſpiſed them, calling them ſo often <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> notwithſtanding all their good works.</p>
            <p>And even though we do them not to be ſeen and praiſed of men, yet the Devil can find his advantage therein by the vain complacency which we take from them within our ſelves. For it is always more honourable to give than to receive. And there are ſome ſo naturally given to liberality; that they will readily give what they have need of themſelves, only to ſatisfie their natural inclination. Others are ſo diſpoſed naturally to action, that they will willingly incommode themſelves, to give Meat and Drink to the Hungry and Thirſty, to lodge Strangers, cloath the Naked, viſit the Sick, and bury the Dead; And that by a natural inclination they have to do ſo.</p>
            <p>And therefore, my Son, you ought well to diſcern the Spirit which moves you to do Works of Mercy, as well ſpiritual as corporal: For the Devil often moves our hearts to multiply them, and do them to exceſs, to diſtract us from inward entertainment;
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:65025:95"/>
and to hinder us, that we may never attain to true virtue; And that ſo we may reſt upon Virtues, which men eſteem ſuch, as are external works of Mercy, which are generally praiſed without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment. But they can well be Sins, inſtead of Virtues: From ſuch, My Son, you muſt keep you well, that the Devil deceive you not. Which you are advertiſed of by</p>

               <p>To the ſame; ſhewing him a Tenth Artifice of the Devil, in our Corporal Good Works taward our Neighbour; which he often brings about to his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: Yet we muſt not therefore ceaſe from them, but joyn Moderation in them, and put away human Conſiderations, and Pride, which attacque us in this time of Tryal.</p>
            </argument>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Son;</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Believe it ſurpriſes you, that I ſaid in my laſt, that <hi>Works of Mercy are often done to the Honour of the Devil.</hi> Yet it is moſt true; but for want of thoroughly conſidering the matter, that offends the tender-conſcienced, and them that by a natural eaſineſs accounts all good, they believe blindly,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:65025:95"/>
that all that's called Good is ſo, and that all ſort of good works are agreeable to God, which is falſe. For the Devil inſinuates himſelf into our beſt actions, to render them evil: And he hath done ſo from the beginning of the world, bringing evil into all the Works of God, which were all created good.</p>
            <p>We may find that in our ſelves; for though God created Man altogether good and perfect, yet we feel that he is now evil and imperfect. He was created to honour God; and moſt men honour the Devil, and obey him in every thing, inſtead of obeying their Creator. All judicious perſons ſee that in the conduct of men now adays to be true. And yet they will not believe, that mens good works are done to the honour of the Devil: and ſo they there that they eſteem more their good works, than thoſe of God. For man, though created of God alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether holy and perfect, ſerves to the honour of the Devil: And wherefore ſhould we not believe, that men's good works ſerve thereto? So ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, though otherways judicious, here fail groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p>But that is not ſtrange, ſeeing the Devil blinds their underſtanding, that they ſhould not ſee the truth of things, but be led by their own inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ſimplicity. For it is much more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to nature, to believe that we do good, than to think that we do evil; and that our good works ſerve to the Honour of God, and not to that of the Devil. For man feels in himſelf a ſatisfaction when he does well, and he hath an ambition to tend to do what is moſt eſtimable. Then being more honourable to ſerve God, than the Devil, men perſwade always themſelves, that they ſerve God, eſpecially when they apply themſelves to
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:65025:96"/>
Works of Mercy, Notwithſtanding the Devil reaps often the glory, more than God. So when the Devil ſees any turn from ſin, and keep himſelf from evil doing, to which he can no more engage him; he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces him ordinarily to do many good works, that he may have eſteem and ſatisfaction in himſelf; And by that he renders the good work evil; or he cauſes the merciful perſons to be much eſteemed and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, that he may make them fall into vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory.</p>
            <p>The Devil hath alſo the art to diſquiet our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, by the care of merciful works both ſpiritual and corporal; And I was exerciſed my ſelf with that Temptation. For in my youth I took care of the poor ſick, I viſited them frequently, I helpt and ſerved them to my power; And alſo I aſſiſted all ſorts of poor and neceſſitous perſons; I endeavoured to reconcile them that were at variance; and to engage the ſlothful to labour; and in ſhort, I laid theſe rhings ſo much to heart, that I ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the cauſe of all ſorts of afflicted that aſkt my aid. And I was grieved to ſend any away unrelieved. I but I found my ſelf at length ſo occupied, that my ſpirit had no more recollection. and I was ſo importuned by theſe poor, that I behoov'd to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from helping them more, and that partly to recover commerce with God, which I had loſt by the voluntary diſtraction, which theſe poor gave me: And partly becauſe I diſcovered daily their Wickedneſs and Deceits. For aboundance ſought my help, only that they might live more at their eaſe, and to commit more ſins; as in effect they did. I gave often Alms, which the Poor uſed in Drunkenneſs, Gluttony and Luxury; and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came idle and lazy. For when they had not ſo great neceſſity to labour, they neglected to undertake
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:65025:96"/>
any work, for their entertainment; becauſe the Alms gave them it with leſs care and pains. Alſo I found them Liars and Deceitful; for they often feigned Neceſſities, Diſeaſes or Infirmities, when there was no ſuch thing. And ſo I ſaw my aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance gave them more matter of ſinning. They ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died to lie cunningly to get wherewith to live in idleneſs. But when my deſign was to do all that I could for the Glory of God, and found that theſe Works of Mercy, turned to that of the Devil, by the inward indiſpoſition of thoſe I would have aſſiſted, now I cannot do any Work of Mercy ſpiritual or corporal, before I know, if it shall be for the Glory of God or not.</p>
            <p>For I love far rather to ceaſe, than to do evil; not that I fear Doing evil upon my part, in aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting my Neigbour in all ſorts of occaſions, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, and without exception of perſons. For I know that God regards always our intentions, and ſees whether they be upright, and aim at his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or at our own, But my fear is in regard of the Poor, who receive our aſſiſtances unworthily; and employ our benefits only to the honour of the Devil: And it is ſo that I underſtand, that Works of Mercy are done to his Honour. I know that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſtrange to you, my Son; but you had not well conſidered my reaſon. For if you will examin the ſtate of men now adays, you will find it ſo corrupt, that it is impoſſible more to exerciſe Works of Mercy, without ſinning in thoſe to whom they are done. For moſt part are Covetous, Unjuſt, Deceiveas, and filled with all ſorts of ſins. And aſſiſting and ſuſtaining them, we co-operate to their ſins. Which we can do in nine manners, as I have elſewhere ſhewn, viz. in <hi>councelling, aſſiſting, defending, contributing,</hi> not <hi>hindering,</hi> (when
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:65025:97"/>
able,) not <hi>accuſing</hi> to them that would hinder it, <hi>partaking, praiſing,</hi> or <hi>flattering evil.</hi> Now all theſe ways of ſinning are in part committed when we aſſiſt the wicked, which we know to be ſuch. For if you know that one covets earthly goods, and give him of them, you co-operate to that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, whether the perſon be poor or rich: the quantity of Goods makes nothing to the ſin, which is committed within the heart, and it is it which cleaves to the goods of this world, inſtead of cleaving to God: And ſin is nothing elſe but that turning from and abandoning God. If then we turn from him, for much money or for little; that does not diminiſh the ſin of Concupiſcence in the heart. It is the ſame with a proud perſon: for if you give him goods or ptofits, you maintain his pride, and become partaker of his ſin, which ſhall be charged on you. Alſo if you give to a Glutton, or a Sloathful Perſon, you contribute to all the ſins which he ſhall commit with your gifts. You ſin alſo if knowing a Liar, or Thief, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful Perſon, you praiſe him, inſtead of decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his wickedneſs to others: for you render your ſelf guilty of all the evils which he ſhall do, becauſe others are not advertiſed and aware of his wickedneſs; Which were it not diſſembled or excuſed, could not hurt ſo many perſons who are deceived becauſe they are ignorant of it; and ſo they yield to him without knowing that they do evil.</p>
            <p>And therefore, my Son, I would advertiſe you, that you let not your ſelf be deceived ignorantly, and for not knowing the ſubtil crafts of the Devil; For ſo he makes himſelf to be honoured, and brings his own glory out of mens beſt actions, when he can no more bring them to evil actions. It is all one to him, if he enſnares us by things good, or evil: He
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:65025:97"/>
does as he that would draw one out of the water; for it is all one if he get hold of his Hand or his Arm; he takes hold where he can moſt eaſily; And when he cannot draw him ſo, he draws by his Feet, Head or Hair, without conſidering much if he takes him by the one or the other.</p>
            <p>The ſame does the Devil with our ſouls, which are in peril of drowning in the raging ſea of this world: God will ſave them by true Virtue: and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Draws contrariwiſe with all his might. For when he ſees he cannot draw them to him by mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt ſins, he draws them by Virtue it ſelf, and by Works of Mercy, which are done moſt part to his honour and glory, unleſs we be ſtrictly on our guard, and diſcover his deceits, that we may evite them. So we muſt purifie our intentions, and ſeek nothing in all our good works but the Glory of God alone: reſiſting all the tentations the Devil can make us; proteſting againſt vain-glory, and all human conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. And ſo it is that we may evite all ſorts of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs and Confuſion; and proceed always with diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to regulate our good works.</p>
            <p>Behold the means to do them not to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Devil; For I would not ſay, that we ſhould ceaſe from good works; we cannot do too many, if we do them with diſcretion. But we muſt labour that the Devil or Sin be not mixed with them; as it ordinarily happens; becauſe men are not wary enough leſt the Devil ſhould mix himſelf into things that are good and holy in themſelves. He was not wanting to tempt Jeſus Chriſt during his Faſt in the Wilderneſs, although nothing could be more holy and perfect than that retreat, whither the Spirit of God had led him, that he might entertain himſelf with his heavenly Father, free from all diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: And nothing more pure than the intentions
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:65025:98"/>
of our Saviour: He ſays: <hi>He came not into the world to accomplish his own Will, but the Will of him that ſent him.</hi> Notwithſtanding the Devil had the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to go to tempt him ſeveral times: by Vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory, <hi>in preſenting to him the Kingdoms of the World</hi>; as alſo <hi>the Stones to convert into Bread, for his Hunger:</hi> He tempted him alſo by the Scripture, ſaying, <hi>That be ſhould throw himſelf down from the pinacle of the Temple, becauſe it is written, that the angel ſhall preſerve us,</hi> &amp;c. Are not theſe full cunning wiles of the Devil, while he uſes the moſt holy things to tempt Jeſus Chriſt? He attempts to catch him, by his Faſts, his confidence in God, and by glory in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting him all the kingdoms of the World.</p>
            <p>How then ſhould he leave untempted frail and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Creatures, like us? For what is man there that muſt not confeſs himſelf far ſhort of the leaſt of Jeſus Chriſt his perfections? Who is he that retires to the Deſert, to give himſelf to entertainment with God, out of the Dangers and Divertiſments of the world? Who refuſes the kingdoms and Riches of the Earth? Who is he among the ſpirituals, that does not tempt God by his Temerity and Preſumption? For they no ſooner receive any particular Light or Grace from God, but they Glory and eſteem them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, beyond others And no ſooner do they forſake ſin, to give themſelves to Works of Mercy, but they think God is beholding to them, and that every body ſhould eſteem them: Which happens to all that begin to ſerve God and follow true Virtue, excepting none, becauſe of the corruption of our nature. He that ſays or believes the contrary is deceived, and walks not in rhe Truth and the knowledge of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. For all men in general, and every particular, brings theſe natural inclinations with him, coming into the world; they are all proud, preſumptuous,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:65025:98"/>
covetous of honour, riches, and pleaſures; Always prefer themſelves to others, and eſteem themſelves worthy of all goods and honour: Yea they think God oblieged to them for the leaſt good action they do; becauſe the Devil hath furred into mans nature that pride of life, which inflames the heart of man, and hinders him to abaſe himſelf and acknowledge his faults. We ſee that even <hi>Adam,</hi> did not hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble himſelf after his ſin, but endeavoured to excuſe it, ſaying, <hi>The Woman which thou gaveſt me, temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me to eat of the Apple; and she ſaid, The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent beguiled me.</hi> All which proceeded from the pride which the Devil had already planted in the heart of our firſt Parents, and conſequently in the hearts of all men that were to proceed from them. For all are ſtained with that ſin of Pride; and ſo they will not acknowledge their faults, but defend them to their power; Which alſo remains with them till death: unleſs they overcome that corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of nature by true Virtue; And when they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at that, they overcome the Devil. For he hath no power but over his own works, or the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption which he hath cauſed in our nature. That being once overcome, we revive in the ſtrength of the grace wherein <hi>Adam</hi> was created. And when man finds himſelf united to God by the love he hath to him, then he ſcorns at the Devil, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a new creature: And ſo will no more have any fellowſhip with that corruption, wherein he was born.</p>
            <p>Yet ſuch an one muſt be upon his guard; for the Devil, who ſeduced our firſt parents, when in the ſtate of Grace may well ſeduce a man that is regenerated in it; ſo long as he lives in his time of tryal, which is this miſerable life; for God will prove mans fidelity to him: He created him free; that liberty then muſt needs be proved, otherwiſe
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:65025:99"/>
it ſhould be conſtraint. For if God had willed abſolutely to conſtrain him to love him, he had been happy, as Gods ſlave: But he would honour man much more, in creating him free, that he might entertain himſelf with him. He would then chooſe the ſoul of man for his Spouſe; and not his Slave; And therefore it muſt have a time of proof or adviſement to reſolve, if it would joyn and unite with its God, or not.</p>
            <p>Now this time of tryal was this preſent life, in which <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould have given teſtimony of his fidelity to his God. Notwithſtanding he was ſo imprudent, as to break the fidelity he owed to the Spouſe of his Soul; would go joyn himſelf to crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, unworthy of his love: And ſo he interrupted the covenant and fellowſhip which God would make with his Soul, even until his ſin and infidelity were purged by repentance. That is the reaſon why his time of tryal was turned into one of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence, which <hi>Adam</hi> underwent faithfully all the time of his life: But the pride which his firſt ſin hath planted in our hearts; makes us often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe him, and wiſh evil to him becauſe of the hurt he cauſed us: As if he were the cauſe of our dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which is a great error.</p>
            <p>For although <hi>Adam</hi> had never ſinned, yet other men might always have damned themſelves by their own ſins during their time of tryal. For each one for himſelf ſhould in this time have given teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his fidelity to God; ſince all men and every one in particular were of the ſame nature and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and alſo in the ſame ſtate, with <hi>Adam</hi> before his ſin. And there is at preſent no other difference betwixt the ſtate of man now, and that of <hi>Adam</hi>; but that ſince ſin came, men are born with an inclination to Evil, whereas <hi>Adam</hi> had
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:65025:99"/>
inclination to Good only when he was created. With that exception we are of the ſame condition with <hi>Adam,</hi> and created for the ſame end; that our ſouls ſhould be ſpouſes to God, provided we remain faithful to him during the time of our tryal and peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, which we muſt attend in this life; which is full ſhort in regard of that of <hi>Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if we knew the truth of things, and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the ſnares of the Devil, to shun and evite them in our good actions; we might hope to attain again to an eternal union with God. For <hi>Adam's</hi> ſin cannot damn us, if our own ſins do it not; ſeeing God hath pardoned <hi>Adam's</hi> ſin, in caſe he ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled his repentance. And he hath alſo pardoned all other men upon the ſame condition: but the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of men now adays is, that they know not thoſe things; and will here enjoy inſtead of ſuffering. Which is a falſe perſwaſion of the Devil, who inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuates himſelf into the holieſt things, while we perceive it not. Which is a truth, ſhe exhorts you to believe, who is careful of your Soul.</p>

               <salute>My Son;</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN my former, I ſet before your eyes, how the Devil tempts men many ways, and inſinuates himſelf into Virtue it ſelf, that he may direct our good works to his own honour and glory: which very often comes to paſs. But I fear leſt by yet ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſort of tentation, he catch you; which you could not diſcover if you were not forewarned of it. To wit, when you have well conſidered the power and wiles of the Devil, and find in your experience, that it is he who incites you to do evil, It is to be feared that you will lay the blame upon the Devil, becauſe ſometimes you do evil againſt your will. For mans heart is ſo proud, that he will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs his fault, and ſo ſeeks for the cauſe of his ſins without himſelf. Which you may the rather do becauſe I have deduced to you at length, that all evils come from the Devil, and all good from God: but though that be moſt true, we muſt not therefore imagin, that the Devil of himſelf can ever force us to do evil. For he is a miſerable impotency, who hath no power over our ſouls, hearts and wills, but ſo much as we give him. The Devil may well repreſent evil to our ſpirit, and incite our wills to follow it; and incite our corrupt nature: but he can never force us, ſo long as our will remains firmly reſolved not to conſent to evil.</p>
            <p>The Devil is as a chained Dog, who can go no further than his Chain permits him; and God will give him no more power than the will of man deſires. For though he permitted him to tempt <hi>Job,</hi> by the loſs of his Goods, Children, Friends, and Health; he did not permit him to cauſe him to fall
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:65025:100"/>
into ſin. And although <hi>Job</hi> curſed the day of his Nativity, he did not herein offend God, nor fall into any ſin; For he curſed only the malediction which ſin brought into human nature; which all men have reaſon to do, in feeling the pains and ſufferings which ſin hath cauſed to us.</p>
            <p>For before ſin, man was not ſubject to any Evil; and he enjoyed all Good, without mixture of evil; He was not annoyed with hunger or thirſt, heat or cold, he had no labour to weary him, he needed no ſleep, nor had any alteration in ſoul or body, was not ſubject to diſeaſes nor death. So that man had enjoyed all ſorts of delights in this world; and the time of tryal being over, confirmed in Grace, he had lived eternally happy and bleſſed.</p>
            <p>But ſin hath deprived him of all that happineſs, and hath reduced him to all ſorts of ſuffering and miſery. Which <hi>Job</hi> conſidering in the midſt of his miſeries, he had reaſon to curſe the day of his birth, when he ſaw himſelf in inevitable miſeries. You muſt conſider that <hi>Job</hi> did not curſe the day that God created him in; on the contrary, he bleſſed him for all, becauſe he was his faithful Servant, and ſo he deſired to ſatisfie divine Juſtice for all his ſins, which he had committed. Now becauſe he ſo deſired, God permitted the Devil to tempt him in divers manners, that <hi>Job's</hi> faithfulneſs might be manifeſt before all men, and the Devil himſelf.</p>
            <p>But they that underſtand not the way of God, judge that <hi>Job</hi> was impatient; which is falſe: For his ſoul rejoyced, in that God pleaſed to uſe him as a mirrour of patience, to confound the Devil; who could never make him fall into ſin, though he eſſayed it ſo many ſeveral ways. God knew that <hi>Job's</hi> heart was ſubmitted to his holy will, and that he offered himſelf continually to him, to be proved
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:65025:101"/>
in what manner it pleaſed him. And becauſe of theſe wiſhes, God permitted that the Devil might tempt him. Now if the Devil had had power over man, he had not needed to ask God's permiſſion to tempt <hi>Job</hi>; for he would have done it of himſelf, without any permiſſion.</p>
            <p>But he hath no power over man, ſave what he by his own free will gives him. Beſides, God can never do any evil to man, nor permit that it befall him, without the conſent of his free will. So if we commit ſin, it is of our own free will; as alſo when we damn our ſelves: for God can never damn any perſon, without doing the greateſt evil that ever was: which cannot proceed from God, who can never do any evil. But it is our ſins that damn us, and not God: for if there were no ſin, there ſhould be no damnation: and ſin depending on man's free will, we muſt not attribute our damnation, either to God, or to the Devil: ſeeing God gives us always Grace in aboundance to ſave us; and the Devil hath no power to damn us.</p>
            <p>So that man alone is truly blameable for the ſins which he commits; and ought never to attribute the fault to the Devil, becauſe he cannot wrong us, if we will not. He may well bark, as the chained Dogs, but he cannot bite us, unleſs we approach him: And therefore, my Son, you ought never to believe that the Devil is the cauſe of your evil doing, though all evils come from him; he cannot effect them in us, without our conſent. He may well afflict our Body or Spirit; when we deſire to purge our Souls by ſuffering.</p>
            <p>Then God ſuffers him to tempt us, by the moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutary things: As he may permit the Devil to bring to poverty a Good Man, when he ſees that he would forget himſelf by Worldly Goods; God loving his
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:65025:101"/>
Soul, ſo takes away his Riches as the occaſion of the Damnation of his Soul. Sometimes alſo he takes away his Honour, or his Health, leſt theſe ſhould hinder the perfection of his Soul. And it is not always directly mans will that theſe things ſhould be taken away from him; for he complains ſometimes of it: but when God takes them away, it is always with the indirect will and conſent of man. For example, the perſon does not deſire to be poor, afflicted, or ſick; but deſires that God ſend him every thing that is neceſſary for his ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And God regarding that good will, removes from him whatever might hinder the advancement of the deſired Salvation. And that is a fatherly Love which God bears to Man, and not a Puniſhment, as the natural ſenſe takes it, and complains of it: But it is truely what the perſon deſired in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of his ſoul, viz, ſalutary things. And the Prophet even prays God, <hi>That he would conſtrain his rebellious will.</hi> By which we may ſee, that God never afflicts a perſon, without his will and conſent direct or indirect.</p>
            <p>Becauſe he created him altogether free, he cannot be touched to good or evil: no more by God, than by the Devil, who can never cauſe man to ſin againſt his will direct or indirect. But man does not always know the indirect will he hath to ſin, and for that ſays or believes, that it is the Devil that makes him ſin, againſt his will; but that is only an excuſe for their ſin.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, the Devil can tempt man againſt his will, but cannot make him ſin againſt his will; he may trouble his ſpirit, and make him remember what he ſhould forget, And forget what he ought to mind: But if the perſon be well upon his guard, and will not do evil, he ſhall diſcover eaſily that
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:65025:102"/>
that comes from the Devil, being againſt his will; and ſo will betake himſelf to continual Prayer to God, which Jeſus Chriſt hath ſo much recommended to us, as moſt neceſſary for our ſalvation. Since we have continually an Enemy to combat, we muſt continually have Arms to defend us: and that will be neceſſary all the days of our life: That is it which the Apoſtle counſels us, <hi>To pray always, without ceaſing</hi>: Becauſe we have always need of divine ſuccour and help, againſt the continual Aſſaults which the Devil gives us. For it is his buſineſs and employ to do the moſt evil he can; And as a Merchant accounts himſelf happy to gain much Money by his Trafick, or an Artiſt by his Labours; ſo alſo the Devil accounts himſelf happy in gaining many ſouls to himſelf, that he may exerciſe on them his Cruelty and Malice. And therefore he never ceaſes for his part to labour, and invent new ſnares to catch the ſoul of man. And when we ſhut the door of our heart to him on one ſide, he attempts to enter by ſome window on the other.</p>
            <p>So that, all human wiſdom is not able to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all the Subtilties of Satan; who being a moſt ſubtil ſpirit, ſurpaſſes in ſubtilty the capacity of man's ſpirit. And therefore is it that he muſt of abſolute neceſſity uſe <hi>continual Prayer,</hi> to diſcover the tentations of the Devil, which he cannot know without a divine Light; and yet leſs hath he po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to reſiſt them, without the aſſiſtance of God: Whom he ought continually to invocate, and call for help, without intermiſſion; Seeing the Devil never ſleeps, and watches over us when we reſt. But the ſtrength of Faith, and Hope in God, can make us overcome the Devil, and deſpiſe him, as but miſerable impotence: Seeing he can never make

us fall into any ſins, without the conſent of our own will, which refuſing him, he can in no wiſe hurt man, although he ſhould tempt him with all his might, during all his life. Theſe tentations ſerve only for greater and true virtues to the man: becauſe he paſſes the time of his tryal, in teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying his faithfulneſs to God; while he does not conſent to the tentations the devil offers.</p>
            <p>And I account it a much happier ſtate to be tempted, than not to be ſo, while we reſiſt the tentations, ſeeing they purge our ſouls, and ſatisfie the Juſtice of God, who hath in Juſtice enjoyned penitence for our ſins, which we muſt needs accompliſh, during the time of our tryal, which God hath limitted ſince the creation of man.</p>
            <p>And if we will not voluntarily ſuffer the tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Devil now, we muſt ſuffer aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly more ſenſible pains after our death, when the ſoul (being ſeparated from this mortal body) feels more vividly the ſeparation from his God, than it does when joyned with its mortal body, which diverts the ſenſe of that ſeparation by its five natural ſenſes, which <hi>ſeeing, hearing, taſting, ſmelling,</hi> and <hi>feeling,</hi> groſs and earthly things, are ſuſpended and amuſed, that he cannot feel ſo lively the ſeparation of his ſoul from God; and ſo charms his great miſery, with the amuſements of earthly things.</p>
            <p>Which are nothing but truely Charms and Bewit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings: for though we ſee by experience, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any perſon in the world, was fully ſatisfied and content with earthly things, although enjoying all they could demand of them; ſo love we them, and that love ruins us from the Love of God, without that we feel the pain of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:65025:103"/>But after death all theſe groſs and earthly things being ended as to us, thence ſhall we feel vividly the abſence of God, becauſe not diverted more with other things; and that ſhall endure until the time of our tryal ſhall be paſt, which God alone knows how long it ſhall endure. But it is moſt certain, that he that will not voluntarily endure the tentations of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil in this preſent mortal life, ſhall aſſuredly ſuffer them more ſenſibly after death; ſeeing no evil ſhall remain unpuniſhed, and no good without recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe. And he that does the good of reſiſting the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, in not following his tentations, muſt expect an everlaſting Reward; and therefore methinks, not to be tempted in this mortal life, is the greateſt of all tentations. Since it deprives us of the good of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying the Juſtice of God, and oblieges us to ſuffer afterward more ſenſible pains.</p>
            <p>And therefore, my Son, be not offended to feel the tentation of the Devil, but reſiſt it valiently, for the Glory is in the combat, and not in Idleneſs and Reſt; ſeeing while we feel not tentation, it is a ſign that the Devil holds us in a lethargique ſleep, to cauſe us to die an eternal death inſenſibly and without pain. But when he combats us with all his forces, it is a ſign that he does not hold us, and that he fears to loſe us. Therefore take courage, and pray God with an humble heart, that he may give you ſtrength, to overcome the Enemy. But never ſay, <hi>it is the Devil makes you do evil:</hi> but ſmite on your Breaſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs your guilt; ſince the Devil cannot compel you to do evil, but only your perverſe will, when it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to his tentations.</p>
            <p>For if the Devil could ſpeak, when you ſay that it is he made you do evil, and ſin, he would give you the lie; and ſay, <hi>that it was not he that made you ſin; but that it was your own will, without the conſent</hi>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:65025:103"/>
               <hi>of which, you cannot ſin.</hi> You may well ſin, without the Devil; for his malice hath entered into us by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam's</hi> firſt ſin: but the Devil cannot bring forth ſin in us without our conſent. You are always free to do evil, though the Devil do not tempt or compel you; becauſe your nature was corrupted by the firſt ſin, and thence all men from <hi>Adam</hi> bring with them in their nativity that corruption and inclination to evil.</p>
            <p>But when man is arrived to the uſe of reaſon, he ought thereby to diſcern good from evil: and chooſe which he will follow. Yea, he hath a natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, which makes him diſcern evil from good; for we ſee often a Child without any Diſcretion, be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed for having done evil; and his countenance te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies ſufficiently that he knows when he commits evil: And therefore we ought never to believe, that we cannot diſcern good from evil, to make choiſe: for that is but to flatter our ſelves.</p>
            <p>For lo! the wickedeſt man in the world, however blinded in his ſins, knows aſſuredly well enough when he does evil: but he hath no will to change his wickedneſs into good, or he hath not the courage to reſiſt the Devil, and that becauſe he hath given him ſo much power over his ſpirit. Otherwiſe man hath in him a good judgment, beyond any other creature: and by that judgment he can aſſuredly know and diſcern good from evil: And it is free for him to chooſe the good and hate the evil, by an abſolute act of his will, which the Devil cannot hinder.</p>
            <p>And moreover, he hath power to reſiſt the Devil by faith, and hope in God, who never fails, to come to the relief of a man who asks and deſires it.</p>
            <p>And therefore, my Son, you muſt never ſay, <hi>that the Devil made you do any evil:</hi> which were to make you his ſlave, and teſtifie your ſubjection to him, as are the Sorcerers, who have given
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:65025:104"/>
him their ſouls, and promiſed to obey him. For ſuch have truely oblieged themſelves to do all the evil he pleaſes: and when they do it not, he beats and abuſes them.</p>
            <p>But you being a Child of God, and voluntarily ſubject to him, you muſt nor fear that the Devil can conſtrain you to ſin againſt your will, and ſo never attribute to him the fault you commit your ſelf. It is true, the Devil firſt incites good perſons to ſin; but they ſhould deſpiſe him, and not follow him, yea, and mock at his tentations. But we muſt always watch over his ſurpriſals, and never ſleep in the way of true virtue. Believe then the Apoſtle's counſel, where he ſays, <hi>My Brethren, be ſober, and watch,</hi> for that very reaſon, <hi>becauſe the Devil goes about us like a roaring Lion, ſeeking to Devour us.</hi> We muſt reſiſt him couragiouſly; and not ſay, <hi>I was not thinking of the Devil, when I fell into evil.</hi> For he deſires willingly that we do evil without thinking on it. That is his beſt recreation. For it does not fall out that good perſons do evil, but while they ſleep, and think not of evil: Then is it that the Devil acts moſt in us, and cauſes that we think not of it, till after the evil is committed. But our negligence or Sleepineſs will not find excuſe before God, ſeeing we are oblieged to watch always, if we would arrive at true Virtue. To which, ſhe exhorts you, who careth for your ſoul.</p>

            <head>THE XVIII. LETTER. The Good and Evil Spirit are known by their Fruit.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>To the ſame, giving him the ſigns to know, whether it is the Good or Evil Spirit that moves us: ſhewing alſo a twelfth Artifice of the Devil, by which he cauſes us to impute our Vices to our natural propenſions, without ſuſpecting him to lurk therein, that he may remain unknown.</p>
            </argument>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Son;</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I ſee yet one difficulty which occurs to your Spirit: to wit, How you ſhould diſcover, when the Devil inſinuates himſelf into your good Actions; and how you ſhall know that it is he that moves you to do good, that he may catch you; or to cauſe that what you do with a good intention, turn to his Honour. For you proteſt, that you will not obey him, nor follow his tentation in any thing, when you diſcover and know that he tempts you. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me, my Son, that is moſt eaſie to diſcern; provided you have an abſolute will to reſiſt the Devil. It is very good and moſt eaſie to diſcover, if it is the good or evil ſpirit, who moves us in all our actions and words, to do or ſay any thing, ſmall or great, becauſe theſe two ſpirits have their qualities and conditions quite different, and work in us quite contrary operations, and diſpoſitions. So that you may as it were feel with your finger, if it is a good or an evil ſpirit, which moves you to ſay or do any thing, by the diſpoſitions you shall feel in your Soul.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:65025:105"/>For the good ſpirit produces in our ſouls Charity, Joy, Peace, Patience, Long-ſuffering, Goodneſs, Bounty, Meekneſs, Chaſtity, Faith, Continence, and Modeſty: And the evil ſpirit on the contrary produces therein Self-love, Sadneſs, Trouble, Impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, Raſhneſs, Wickedneſs, Fretting, Pride, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, Intemperance, Inequality, Unconſtancy, and Impurity: which are all things contrary to the fruits of the good Spirit. And as the tree is known by its fruit, ſo may we know the evil ſpirit by the fruit he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces in our ſouls: And therefore we muſt always examin, if our enterpriſes or the will or intentions we have to do or leave undone any thing, produce in our ſouls Charity, Peace, Faith, Joy, and the reſt: And then we may be aſſured that our enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and wills are from God; ſeeing they bring unto us the fruits of his ſpirit.</p>
            <p>But if on the contrary, we feel in our ſouls Self-love, Sadneſs, Impatience, and the reſt; we may well be aſſured that our deſires and enterpriſes are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by the Devil. Which is a firm and ſure rule. We need not then amuſe our ſelves at fine ſpeculations, to diſcover if we be moved by the Devil to do or leave undone any thing, while we feel in our ſelves the effects of a good or an evil ſpirit. For the Devil will never incite to Charity, ſeeing it is a divine Quality, which the Devil hath not in his power, and which unites ſouls to God: But he draws from ſelf-love all manner of advantage, and declines the ſoul from the love of God.</p>
            <p>For he that loves himſelf, covets Pleaſures, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Riches, and all that is not God; and ſo he is ſad, and is not in the capacity to acquire true Virtue, for he hath not courage to reſiſt the tentation of the Devil; but ſuffers himſelf rather to be overcome by dark melancholy Thoughts. But the good Spirit
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:65025:105"/>
baniſhes theſe thoughts by the joy which it brings to the Soul: And although there were all ſorts of occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Sadneſs externally, even for our ſins; that good Spirit comforts and rejoyces the bottom of the ſoul amidſt the moſt ſenſible Troubles and Pains. When we have then inward joy in the midſt of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings it is an aſſured teſtimony that the holy Spirit dwells in us. Which hath often rejoyced me in the midſt of Suffering and Perſecutions: I felt therein a great joy in the bottom of my Soul, in lamenting my ſins; and I thanked God that he gave me theſe Tears of Repentance.</p>
            <p>But the Devil gives only counterfeit and external joys, which afflict and grieve the heart when they are over: that is the cauſe why we ſee worldly perſons always ſearch after new Recreations and Divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: For th'one is no ſooner gone, but Melancholy and Sadneſs ſeiſes the heart, who would ſo divert himſelf: and for that he hunts inſatiably after new divertiſments, without finding withal true Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which we cannot have but by the joy of the Holy Spirit, and that joy is not to be found among the Divertiſments of the World. I was aſtoniſht, to hear one day of a perſon, who would re-eſtabliſh <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that he ſearcht for a great Houſe with a Garden, to divert himſelf and walk therein, as alſo that he muſt ſometimes go to walk in the field, or go in a Barque of Pleaſure or Boat, to divert him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; which gave me enough to underſtand, that the Holy Spirit had not yet brought forth his fruits in his ſoul, though he was accounted a Saint. For then ſhould he not have needed human Divertiſments to be joyful by.</p>
            <p>As for me, I know by experience, that I have more joy and contentment in my ſoul, in Solitude, and far from human divertiſments; than I have in
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:65025:106"/>
mens converſation, or amongſt the moſt divertiſing Objects. Which gives aſſurance, that my joy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the Holy Spirit. It muſt needs be that it comes not from human means: for it were my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, never to come out of my Cloſet, and to hear nothing but in my own heart and inner man.</p>
            <p>But the Joy which proceeds from the evil Spirit, terminates and ends always in Sadneſs and Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, with an earning after new Divertiſments, to divert that Sadneſs; ſo that it is moſt eaſie to Diſcover, if it is the good or evil ſpirit; which dwells in our ſouls, by the Diſpoſitions and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which we feel in them; when we have the deſire to do or ſay any thing, we need not ſo much go to conſider if it is in appearance good, or indifferent, to know if it comes from God, as to examin the diſpoſition which that deſire brings into our ſoul: to wit, if it is in Peace, and waits for the effect of its deſires with Patience and Long-ſuffering. For that is a ſign the Spirit of God hath given us that deſire, and that it is his will that we effect it: but if we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that that deſire to do or ſay any thing marr our Peace; and diſturb our Spirit with impatience, and attempt to precipitate us before the time of fulfilling our deſires; That is a ſign that it comes from an evil ſpirit: And if the deſire, or thing is good in it ſelf, it is a ſign that the Devil would mix and inſinuate himſelf into that good work, to reap his Glory thence. However, we muſt not ceaſe to do or ſpeak what is good in it ſelf, but we muſt be on our guards, that we ſuffer not the Devil to inſinuate himſelf in it. We muſt then uſe continual Prayer, to have God's ſuccour and Aſſiſtance, and Strength to overcome the tentation, which the Devil offers us, while we are doing good.</p>
            <p>We muſt never ceaſe from doing Good Works, becauſe of the tentation of the Devil; For he
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:65025:106"/>
would gladly always hinder them if he could; But we muſt examin well the inward diſpoſition of our Souls, to diſcover if the Devil does not inſinuate himſelf therein, that we may purifie our intentions, and beware that the Devil find no advantage therein. And if you will know, my Son, when it is God that inſpires any thing to you; remark always if it is accompanied with Goodneſs, Benignity, Faith, Continence and Chaſtity: For God never gives inſpirations that are not accompanied with theſe conditions: But the Devil often gives inclinations to do good with Fretting, Malice, Deſpite, Diſpair, Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, Levity, and Impurity. I have ſeen ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times perſons that gave to the Poor by Deſpite and Fretting, upbraiding and reproaching them, without any faith of an eternal Reward. I have ſeen others aſſiſt at publique Devotions with inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and lightneſs; And now adays almoſt all marry by incontinence and impurity. All theſe things, though good in themſelves, are induced and excited by the evil ſpirit; ſince they tend to an evil end, though good in appearance. And therefore muſt we always be upon our guard, and watch againſt ſo powerful an Enemy, who attempts to ſurpriſe us in all our actions, both good and indifferent, that he may render them evil: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt ſtudy well to diſcern the good ſpirit from the evil: Which we may do, ſeeing there are aſſured marks to know them. Never ſay then, My ſon, that you know not if it is God or the Devil who moves you to do or omit any thing: but rather acknowledge with Humility of heart, that you are not vigilant enough and diligent to diſcover that evil ſpirit, who dazles your under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that you ſhould not know him. For
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:65025:107"/>
every word you ſpeak or action you do, you may diſcover if it comes of the Devil, provided you make a ſerious reflection upon your ſelf; But the miſery is, that we are diſtracted and wandering, and the Devil makes us forget what we ſhould remember, and puts in our mind what we ſhould forget, that he may bring confuſion in all our behaviour.</p>
            <p>Remark well that Advertiſment, and you ſhall find by experience, that it is but too well grounded; for ſince the Devil can no more make you fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to manifeſt ſins, he will always endeavour to make you contradict the holy ſpirit, which you do not yet know well. You have indeed reſolved in general to obey him, and follow him; as you have done in abandoning the World, in looſing your affections from earthly goods, and deſiring to follow Jeſus Chriſt in his Lowneſs and Humility. All that proceeds from the Spirit of God, who hath governed you in the moſt important things, and the Devil could not hinder it. But now he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacques you in ſmall things and of little import, that he may hinder you to do the will of God in every thing; and often he gains your will to make it contrary to the will of God in common and ordinary things. For if you reflect upon your ſelf, you ſhall find there a certain oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to whatever I propoſe to you, which comes often even contrary to your will; yea, you are vexed that you ſhould have ſo oppoſed or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted me. Yet on the firſt occaſion you do it again: which cannot proceed of your ſelf, ſince you are diſpleaſed at it. Now it is a firm and true Rule, that whatever Evil we do againſt our will, comes of the Devil; and not of our ſelves. I know that Spirit of contradiction which you have
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:65025:107"/>
againſt what I deſire, comes not of your own will. For you would gladly obey me in every thing, ſeeing you know that I never deſire any evil: But you cannot in effect obey me in things good and ſalutary, which comes aſſuredly of the Devil, who is a ſpirit directly contrary to the Spirit of God, which governs me. For he moves as ſoon as I ſpeak, and brings ſome contradiction or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to what I propoſe; he is troubled enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and frets, and would cauſe among us Thunder and Lightning, as Heat and Cold do which occur in the air; Which you do often, and know not to help it, becauſe you have not ſufficiently Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered that it is the Devil does it in you againſt your will: For you alledge ſometimes reaſons, as if you would ſuſtain his Quarrel, and ſhew that you have reaſon to contradict me; which you could not do, if you believed that I have the Spirit of God, from whom no evil can proceed: But the Devil makes you forget that, and excite in you a ſpirit of contradiction: to which your nature is alſo enclined, which is the cauſe you Diſcover not ſufficiently that it is the Devil; and attribute it to your natural inclination. Which yet is not ſo, though it mix it ſelf with the Devil's motion. It is his cuſtom, to follow every ones natural inclination, to cover himſelf the better that he be not known.</p>
            <p>And by that Device, he remains unknown, each attributing his fault to his nature, one would be ſupported in his Anger; Another in his Sadneſs and Moroſity; Another in his Luſt. Saying often, <hi>I cannot help theſe things, it is my Nature.</hi> That is a language the Devil hears gladly; becauſe ſo he lurks unknown, and makes us go from evil to worſe unto death: But they that have eſteemed
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:65025:108"/>
the Malice and Wickedneſs of the Devil, natural Weakneſs and infirmities, ſhall ſee clearly at death that it is Deviliſh Malice which mixes it ſelf with every ones natural inclination. And the Devil labours always to diſcover theſe natural inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that he may the better play his part, and remain unknown under that covert of natural infirmities.</p>
            <p>And ſo he amuſes many, that they never think it is the Devil, becauſe he is ſo ſtraitly united with their natures: and that is his ſubtility. He knows well, he ſhould not be ſo much obeyed, if he gave tentations contrary to ones natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, and ſo he follows always every ones Nature, and augments the inclinations which he finds there. If he meets with a Cholerique perſon, he ſtirs him up the more to Anger. If a Luxurious, or Sad perſon, he augments their Luxury or Sadneſs to gain them all on the weakeſt ſide; he does as an Enemy, that would attacque a City, he will not aſſault where it is fortified, but where it is weakeſt; if he find ſome corner of the wall broken, he attempts to break it more, that by it he may enter the Town<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being the moſt advantagious entry for him: And the Devil our Town Enemy does the very ſame; he cannot ſurpriſe us in things wherein we are on our guard: ſo he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacques us where we do not expect it: and by that means he gains eaſily our will, and makes it obey him in what we have inclination to.</p>
            <p>We muſt then always make a ſerious reflection on all our words and actions, and then we ſhall eaſily diſcover, what comes from the devil; ſeeing it hath always his qualities, and produces within us the fruits of Envy, Trouble, Impatience, Sadneſs, and others which I marked above. We
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:65025:108"/>
may alſo remark enough the qualities of the things the Devil cauſes us to do; For if you will examin your ſelf narrowly, you ſhall always find ſomething in your words untrue or diſſembled, or ſpoke by vain complacency to pleaſe men: which makes that there is not always Juſtice in your words; For he that ſpeaks by the good Spirit, is true in the bottom, and never ſpeaks any thing to pleaſe or flatter men: but declares natively the truth of things; as well what is contrary to himſelf, as what is advantagious: ſeeing he ſeeks only to pleaſe God alone.</p>
            <p>To know if our actions are excited by the Devil or not, you need but mark, if they be done for the Glory of God, or for your own, and if you ſeek not your ſelf therein. For the Devil will always incite us to ſeek our ſelves in all that we do. He knows well that Self-love mars the Love of God: And ſo he excites our underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to conſider, if what we do or ſay ſhall be advantagious to us, if it ſhall give us Pleaſure, Honour or Profit: and when we obſerve none of theſe advantages in it, he ſlackens our courage, that we do not accompliſh our undertaking, nor proſecute our work.</p>
            <p>The good Spirit on the contrary incites always to labour for the Glory of God, and Aſſiſtance of our Neighbour: And ſo he that is guided thereby does nothing for his own proper intereſt, but endeavours to his power to aſſiſt his Neighbour in need: becauſe the Charity, which that good ſpirit carries in it, attends more the common good than his own particular.</p>
            <p>By that, my Son, you may obſerve all your words and actions, to know if they are excited by the good or evil Spirit; For theſe are infallible marks to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcern
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:65025:109"/>
the ſpirits, if from God, or the Devil, without amuſing you to Speculate or ſeek to diſcover the Devil in himſelf, ſince he is an inviſible ſpirit, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible to your underſtanding: but you ſhall always diſcover him infallibly by his qualities, and the fruits which he produces in your ſoul, and your inward diſpoſition will tell you it.

            <p>I See you are grieved in Spirit becauſe the Devil hath power to tempt men ſo many divers ways; but you ſhould rejoyce, while you learn the truth of every thing. For if you knew it not, the Devil would ſeduce you by ignorance, as he hath done ſo many thouſands who have obeyed him, becauſe
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:65025:109"/>
they did not know it; they thought to follow the will of God, while they followed certainly that of the Devil, and ſo have periſhed inſenſibly.</p>
            <p>For before God Ignorance does not excuſe ſin; every one is oblieged to know what he ought to do and omit, to attain to Salvation. We need not think to ſay to God after death, <hi>Lord, I knew not this or that;</hi> or I <hi>thought not I did evil in that;</hi> for all excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes will be uncurrent coyn, which will not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived nor approved of him; ſeeing we have aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly the means to find, if we have the deſire to ſeek. What ſhould we ſay, to ſee a man poor and miſerable, overcharged with his enemies, when he will not be at the pains to labour or ſeek a better way of living, and would needs ſleep and reſt at his eaſe, though he knew himſelf to be ſurrounded by his Enemies? we ſhould certainly ſay, that man were the cauſe of his own miſeries, and of all the evil that may befal him. And why will you not judge alſo, that he who neglects to ſearch the means of his ſalvation, and to diſcover the wiles of the Devil his Enemy; is the cauſe of his own Damnation? for it can be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted only to our ſelves, ſeeing we have aboundantly the means to find if we had a true deſire to ſeek. Tell me, I pray you, what cauſe of ignorance can a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> pretend, who reads and hears the Goſpel, and the Teachings of Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles; to which he gives credit, and accords that they teach that there is a Devil who is our Enemy, and who ſeeks to Devour us; that our life is a continual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat; that we muſt watch and pray, that we enter not into tentation. Notwithſtanding men will not do either the one nor the other; but live at eaſe, without fighting; they remain in quiet amidſt the danger of their Enemies.</p>
            <p>And which is ſtrange, when any would waken
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:65025:110"/>
them out of that Lethargique Sleep, they are grieved and diſſatisfied, notwithſtanding that Sleep will aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly procure them eternal Death, if they do not awake to fight their Enemies. We cannot hinder that theſe Enemies aſſail us every where: but they are unwilling to be diſcovered, becauſe an Enemy diſcovered is half vanquiſht.</p>
            <p>And therefore, my Child, you ought to rejoyce rather than be ſorrowful, that God permits that I now diſcover ſo many wiles of the Devil; For you cannot make that he be not wicked, and that all manner of malice proceeds not from him; nor can you hinder that he tempt men, ſince our firſt parents have given him that power: and if they had not done it, we give him dayly the ſame power over us, which he got over them, by the conſent of our will to his tentation; It being ſo, we muſt fight, or render to him; which were lamentable. For we were created true Children of God, after his Image and Reſemblance: And we should become by our Sloath, Children of the Devil; which you muſt never ſuffer; but endeavour to diſcover the evil, and reſiſt it to your power: And bleſs God alſo, that he ſends you his Light, that you may know it, and beware of it; without afflicting your ſelf ſo much becauſe the Devil hoth power to tempt men.</p>
            <p>For tentations purifie the ſoul, and render it agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God: He takes pleaſure to ſee us fight his and our Enemies: And he gives us ſtrength and aid if we perſevere conſtantly: yea he hath prepared for us Triumphant Lawrels and Eternal Rewards of Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory. Therefore you muſt not give place to that feebleneſs of ſpirit; to languiſh becauſe the Devil hath power to tempt men, ſince it is not in you to take it from him: he hath too long poſſeſſed it.</p>
            <p>For ſince he made himſelf the Enemy of God, he
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:65025:110" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hath had power to do in himſelf all the evil he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; although his evil cannot hurt man unleſs he conſent. For man hath full liberty to reſiſt him; as the Devil hath full liberty to tempt us. If that were not true, he could never have tempted <hi>Adam</hi> our firſt Father, who was altogether holy and perfect at his Creation; and had not in his beginning given any occaſion to the Devil to tempt him. But the Devil being created free, as well as man, he had power to do all the evil he pleaſed in himſelf. For he would even be equal with God, which is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter evil than to tempt <hi>Adam</hi> in his innocence: And that of tempting men now is yet far leſs, ſeeing they are corrupted by the firſt Sin; And it is yet leſs when he tempts them, that have ſo often conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him with deliberate will. And therefore, my Son, you have no ground to fret becauſe the Devil hath power to tempt you; but you ought truely to regret, that you have by your paſt ſins given him ſo much power over your ſoul. Reſolve now to war againſt him with manly courage, and hinder that he get more power over your ſoul, by reſiſting his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; for that is a holy and ſalutary Reſolution.</p>
            <p>But that Grief which you conceive becauſe the Devil hath power to tempt you and others, comes from him. He makes us always deſire things impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and ſuch as are not in our power, that he may afflict and diſcourage us. For he knows well, that a grieved and diſcouraged perſon, is not well fitted to reſiſt his tentations, and that in that ſtate he can eaſily lead him from one evil to another. And therefore he often cauſes vain griefs; ſuch as is that, which proceeds from that the Devil hath ſo much power to tempt men, and alſo the diſturbing grief for our ſins paſt, which are no more in our power.</p>
            <p>Theſe are Extremities into which the Devil at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:65025:111"/>
always to precipitate us. It is true, we ought to regret that we have willingly given the Devil ſo much power over us; and more lament our by paſt ſins: but we muſt not therefore reſt in theſe griefs, ſeeing they would mar the Graces of God in us. It is better to go to God by love and amendment of life, than by Melancholies, which proceed from the Devil: for before his entry there was nothing but all joy in the world and in the heart of man. So that ſadneſs is truely a quality of the Devil; and ſo man ought to Deſpiſe it if he ſeeks after true virtue. He ought indeed to have a ſincere regret from his heart, that he hath offended God, and beg pardon of him as often as he remembers his ſins: but he ought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to ſuffer himſelf to be overcome of grief, ſince what's paſt is not in his power; And though he ſhould deſtroy himſelf, he can never make that what is paſt ſhould not be.</p>
            <p>He ought then for penitence of his by-paſt ſins, endeavour a true converſion to God; departing from evil to do good, deteſting ſin to embrace true virtue. Which is a true contrition, much more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, than tears and immoderate ſadneſs, which the Devil ordinarily gives them that begin. Of which you muſt beware, my Child; for God would be ſerved with a ready and joyful heart: And he ſays, <hi>that he treats with the converted ſinner, as if he had never offended him.</hi> You ſhould then rejoyce for the Grace God hath given you to forſake the World, and to turn from Vanity unto the Truth, which you now diſcover; and not afflict your ſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Devil hath ſo much power to tempt men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeeing that power cannot be exerciſed, but on thoſe that give or have given him their full conſent: and that all things turn to good to them that fear God. When the Devil tempts you, remember that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:65025:111"/>
hurt you without your own conſent; and your reſiſting his tentation renders you agreeable to God. For your ſoul muſt be proved, as Gold in the Furnace, which grows ſtill the purer by continuing in the fire. Even ſo is a ſoul purified by long tentation, if it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main firm in reſiſting; and nothing can hurt it, but ſin; from which if it abſtain, it carries the victory over its enemies; and all they can do againſt it are but falſe allarms, which try its Fidelity and Vigilancy.</p>
            <p>And therefore, we muſt not deſire that the devils power ſhould be taken from him; but earneſtly pray to God for ſtrength to reſiſt him, and fight until death. For Jeſus Chriſt in the prayer which he left to <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> hath not asked to be free from tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but only not to be led to follow the tentation, and to be delivered from evil: And ſince there is no other evil but ſin, we pray only to be delivered from it, and not from tentation; which is often profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſalutary for us; yea, ſometimes neceſſary to our frailty. For our nature is ſo feeble and corrupted, that it could not remain faithful to God out of tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; forgetting ordinarily it ſelf in too much Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity; we ſee daily among men, that he that proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, becomes proud, and fixes in the world as in a place of abode, and permanent: And on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that he that is in Adverſity and tribulation, becomes humble, and hath his recourſe to God. I ſpeak of ſuch as are well-meaning and pious; for to the wicked all turns to evil: If they Proſper, they offend God the more; if they are in Adverſity, they blaſpheme him, and deſpair.</p>
            <p>And all theſe things arrive in temporal Proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Adverſities; ſo do they alſo to them that ſeek after true Virtue: for not being tried by Tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ſufferings, they ſhould not perſevere in Virtue. Although they were arrived at the profoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:65025:112"/>
knowledge of divine Myſteries, had the Gift of Prophecying, and doing Miracles; all that ſhould vaniſh into ſmoak, except they Paſs through the furnace of Tentations, and Afflictions. For we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in this life arrive at that degree of Perfection, in which <hi>Adam</hi> was at his Creation: who yet fell full ſordidly into ſin againſt his God. He forgot God, and turned himſelf to the Creatures; for he had all ſorts of Proſperity, Joy, Content and Pleaſure, and knew not evil; he could not imagin that his turning from God, would render him ſo miſerable, having never felt any Miſery.</p>
            <p>But after he was tempted of the Devil, and ſaw by experience, that earthly Pleaſures and Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments had rendered him ſo miſerable; he was loath to ſtay longer in them, and loved rather to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Sufferings, and Patience, as he did all the time of his life, as to remain in the pleaſures of an earthly Paradiſe: which had made him forget his God, by ſenſible Pleaſures. And if <hi>Adam</hi> a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo noble, ſo holy and ſo perfect as God created him, could not remain conſtant in the fidelity which he owed to his Creator, before his tryal of tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as he certainly did after them, how ſhould we, contemptible and frail Creatures, born with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion to evil, be able to remain faithful to God, without being proved by tentation? Our ſouls ſhould be like wood ſilvered on the out-ſide, which ruſts with a little rain: but we muſt endeavour to render them Silver or Gold, purified by the fire of tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and afflictions; otherwiſe we can never arrive at true Virtue, to which you, my Son, aſpire.</p>
            <p>And therefore, rejoyce, rather than afflict your ſelf, becauſe the Devil hath power to tempt you; for his tentations ſerve to perfect your ſoul, and to acquire true Virtue; at which you cannot arrive,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:65025:112"/>
without paſſing through the furnace of Tribulations and Tentation of the Devil. That Furnace is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument moſt neceſſary for the perfection of your ſoul. So Conſtrain your ſelf to embrace them, as St. <hi>Andrew</hi> embraced the Croſs, Saying, <hi>O Good Croſs.</hi> Say alſo, <hi>O bleſſed Tentation! ſeeing by it I shall become more agreeable to God.</hi> You have perhaps when in the World, loved your miſtreſſes Favours or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours: Shew now that you have choſen Jeſus Chriſt for your Lover, love and carry willingly his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours and Livery, eſteem as love-favours all the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations which the Devil gives you: becauſe Jeſus Chriſt was cloathed all the days of his life with Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and Sufferings, both from Devils and Men. You muſt then wear his Livery if you will be his Servant.</p>
            <p>Do you not feel, my Son, that the Devil tempts you every day? yea, every hour and moment; and for that you have need to fight and reſiſt conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, if you would be ſaved. It is a good ſign, that you perceive and feel the tentation: for many feel it not at all, and follow in every thing the tentation of the Devil. Would you willingly be ſeiſed with that Lethargy? and would you wiſh that the Devil ſhould tempt you no more? that were an evident ſign, that he held you as his own; for ordinarily he tempts but little the perſons that do his will eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. He leaves ſuch in quiet, and they are well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent not to be vexed with tentations. They ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin themſelves to be then in a good ſtate, though they be in effect in the greateſt of all tentations. But God hath delivered you from that danger, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king you know and feel the tentation; So you can no more be ignorant of it. For I have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you it too plainly; and you feel it alſo upon occaſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:65025:113"/>I ſee by the eyes of the Spirit, that the Devil moves your paſſions, ſo ſoon as I open my mouth to ſpeak to you; and I feel, that your inward motions are ſtirred up to oppoſe and contradict mine: Which cannot proceed from your ſelf; for you have reſolved aſſuredly to follow and hear me; becauſe, you are convinced in your conſcience that the ſpirit of God governs me; And yet you cannot do it upon occaſion; and you feel fightings againſt what-ever I propoſe to you. Now if you will not reſiſt thereto, you ſhall always follow the will of the Devil, which you deſire not to do.</p>
            <p>You muſt then watch continually; and be never weary to reſiſt the Devil, no more than he is to tempt you. The greateſt aſſault he gives you now, is to make you contradict and oppoſe my will and deſires. And that becauſe he ſees, that if you follow my will, you follow aſſuredly the will of God, ſeeing I have no other will but his: And therefore it is that he acts continually in you to contradict me; and your ſpirit ſtrives againſt mine, as <hi>Gabriel</hi> did with <hi>Lucifer.</hi> You muſt reſolve to which you will give the Victory. If you will that the ſpirit which is in you have the Victory, that ſhall be the Devils will: But if you will that the ſpirit which is in me, carry it; you muſt combate your own, and hold it ſuſpect in every thing. For from a ſpirit that is evil can nothing good proceed. Now you cannot doubt but the ſpirit which is in you is evil, ſeeing it oppoſes it ſelf to mine, and does the things which you would not of your own will do; and that you have diſpleaſure from the bottom of your ſoul, that you contradict me, and are not conformed to my will. For your own will cannot be contrary to it ſelf, and cannot will that which it wills not.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:65025:113"/>And ſo we muſt conclude, that it is the evil ſpirit who acts in you, contrary to your own will: and ſince you will not obey him, you ought to be very glad that I reſiſt him upon occaſion. For I hold him for my Enemy, and will oppoſe him with all my power in every one in whom I perceive him, all I do in you. I am then ſure that it is the Devil, that evil ſpirit, who gives and inſpires in you theſe oppoſitions to my will; For if it were not he that oppoſes, you would follow all my will and deſires with joy.</p>
            <p>Reſiſt then valiently all your proper inclinations, and hold ſuſpected all the motion of your corrupt nature; to which the Devil is united, and by theſe motions he acts in you: But receive my ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, and follow that which I encline to, and you ſhall follow aſſuredly the Spirit of God: So ſhall you carry the victory over that evil ſpirit, who troubles you now. Ply and ſubmit your underſtanding under the Holy Spirit, and never believe your ſelf wiſer than him in any thing. For men are now abandoned to the ſpirit of error; and their beſt Sciences are but Ignorance, their Wiſdom Folly; And although you think ſometimes to have reaſon to contradict me, do it not: And after you ſhall ſee that your reaſon cannot be better than mine, which you may experiment, while I remain.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>To the ſame; to whom is ſhewn a Fourteenth ſnare of the Devil, more pernicious than the reſt, viz. Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Negligence: He is moved to Spiritual Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, by conſideration of the diligence uſually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on temporal things, which the Children of this World adminiſter with more Care and Prudence than the Children of Light do Spiritual Things.</p>
            </argument>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Son;</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Perceive, it appears ſome what difficult to you, to watch continually ſo narrowly over all your Words and Actions: But believe me, if you do it not, the Devil will aſſuredly ſurpriſe you in every thing: And you ſhall obey him without knowing it. For he is a moſt cunning ſpirit, who watches always, without reſt. And therefore it is neceſſary, deſpiſing all difficulties to reſolve ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely for the combat, if you will obtain ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and tend to true Virtue. For without fighting, there is no Victory; and except you apply your ſpirit, to watch diligently over all your actions and words, you ſhall fall into all ſorts of evil.</p>
            <p>And therefore is it, that they call Negligence a mortal or capital ſin. Now Negligence is not underſtood to be a mortal ſin, as ſignifying the want of bodily travail and labour: for many perſons
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:65025:114"/>
are not oblieged to bodily labour, having other occupations of Body and Spirit more profitable and neceſſary ſometimes than bodily Labour: And when they apply themſelves to thoſe good and uſeful things, they fall not into that ſin of Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, which is called mortal; for every one ought to occupy himſelf in different things, according to his condition or diſpoſition.</p>
            <p>A ſick perſon cannot labour bodily, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo not in Spirit neither, becauſe of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, and ſo he falls not into the mortal ſin of Negligence: for he may by acting reſignation to the will of God, be more diligent, than one that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours both in Spirit and Body. A good Maſter of a Family labours often more in eying and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over his Servants, than he that delves the Ground. An Artiſt labours more by ordering well the Building of a Houſe, than the Workman that builds it; And ſo with other perſons, who perform their duty, every one in his ſtate and vocation.</p>
            <p>So that we muſt not believe, that that ſin of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence is committed by them that labour not corporally, but by all them that neglect to watch over their ſouls, and to diſcover the tentation of the Devil: Seeing ſuch neglect their eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and conſent tacitly to the tentation of the Devil; which is certainly a mortal ſin, and cauſes Eternal Damnation: that is it, wherefore this Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence is accounted among capital ſins, and ought to be called Mortal, ſince it cauſes Death to the Soul.</p>
            <p>For he that, through Negligence, does not re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſiſt the Devil, he leaves his ſoul a prey to him; And he that ſearches not all means to find true Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, ſhall never obtain it; but dying without it, ſhall never come to eternal Happineſs: And therefore
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:65025:115"/>
you muſt of neceſſity have ſpiritual Diligence, if you would be ſaved; For it were but flattering of your ſelf to think, that God will receive your Excuſes, when you ſhall ſay, <hi>I did not know that the Devil had ſo much Subtilty and Power over us to tempt us:</hi> or if you ſhould think to excuſe your ſelf before God by your Frailty and Weakneſs, you could not abſtain from ſin, and could not attain to true Virtue, becauſe you could not find the way. For all theſe Excuſes and falſe Reaſons God will not accept, becauſe he ſearches the Reins, and tryes the Conſciences, and ſees the leaſt motions of our wills; And he knows (without needing witneſſes) what Diligence we have given to watch over our Souls, and what Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to evite ſin, and follow true Virtue.</p>
            <p>For God is not as men, who amuſe one another by the falſe Philoſophy which they've learnt in the Schools: which ſerves only to maintain wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and excuſe the malice of their likes. They invent ſmooth words, to make wickedneſs appear Truth, and pleaſe themſelves with theſe fine words, and ſuffer themſelves to be perſwaded, that Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood is Truth, when adorned with the fine terms and words of their falſe Philoſophy. But God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards the Eſſence and Reality of the thing, and ſees even to the bottom of our Souls; and ſo he knows if we have done all Diligence in earneſt to diſcover the deceits of the Devil, and find the means to arrive at true Virtue; and finding that we have done neither the one nor th'other we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, without place for Excuſes.</p>
            <p>And ſo my Child, you muſt not be deceived: Think not to find Excuſes before God, when you have lived in ſpiritual Negligence; for he will not accept them. He hath given you a Body and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and that to apply them both diligently to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchew
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:65025:115"/>
evil and follow good. But the miſery is, that men now adays are fallen into ſo profound an ignorance, that they employ body and ſoul in Care and Diligence to acquire the things of the earth, and render themſelves by that means incapable of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſpiritual Diligence: for when a Veſſel is filled with dung, there can be nothing that is good put in it.</p>
            <p>Alas! what are all the Cares of the buſineſs and affairs of the world, other than Dung, which hath filled your Spirit? You were a diligent Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant; and your care and diligence hath heaped up money to you: but now what will you do with that money? you cannot expend it for Meat and Drink and Cloathing, nor can you carry it with you at Death; and if you leave it to your Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they ſhall thereby become more vicious, and proud. So that every way you muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that your ſpirit hath been always filled with the dung of cares and diligence for earthly things; And it is no wonder that ſo you could not diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the wiles of the Devil, nor the means which advance unto true Virtue, becauſe your Diligence was employed about other things. But now, when the Goodneſs of God hath diſcovered to you the truth of theſe things, you muſt endeavour to uſe that Diligence to diſcover the tentations of the Devil, and the means to arrive at Virtue, which formerly you uſed in your temporal affairs. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you would not then let ſlip any occaſion, wherein you ſaw any profit, without accepting it; and that you ſuffered not your ſelf to be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, when you could diſcover the Deceits they would put on you.</p>
            <p>Now if you had ſuch vigilance, for the goods which paſs away ſo ſwiftly, and can give no help at death: how can it now be difficult for you to
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:65025:116"/>
uſe the ſame diligence to diſcover the Devil, and the ſure way of true Virtue, that you may thereby gain Goods that ſhall never end? Ought you not rather to double your Diligence, Care, and Study to acquire eternal Goods, than to find difficulty in it; which you found not to acquire the goods of this world. Think you them more worthy than the eternal? I do not think ſo of you, ſeeing there is no compariſon betwixt them. For temporal goods afford nothing to our ſouls, but care to preſerve them, and regret to leave them: whereas vigilance to acquire eternal Goods, brings an inward Joy, Hope in God, and repoſe in the Soul: And beſide, we cannot live in ſpiritual Negligence, without being in that mortal ſin of ſloath.</p>
            <p>I know you deſire not to live in ſin: but you have not ſufficiently diſcovered in what that ſin of Sloathfulneſs conſiſts. It appears to you a repoſe, to live without tentations, and without watching ſo preciſely over your words and actions: but that ſmall Repoſe you might have in this life, ſhould cauſe you eternal Diſquiet.</p>
            <p>For we are not come into this world to reſt, but to be careful, to watch and to labour for our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation ever until we have obtained it. We muſt not then go to change the order of God. He hath ſent us into this world, as unto a place of Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or into a Priſon of Penitence, to ſatisfie his divine Juſtice: And we would yet live here in eaſe, without Care, or Diligence, or watching againſt our Enemies. Though worldly perſons watch ſometimes night and day, to gain a little Money, ſome vain and empty Honour, or infamous Pleaſure. Believe me, theſe Worldlings ſhall riſe up againſt us in the day of judgment, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found us, that they have watched, laboured and
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:65025:116"/>
cared more in the ſervice of the world, than you have done in the Service of God.</p>
            <p>Apply your ſelf then to the Diligence neceſſary for diſcovering the Wiles of the Devil your ſworn Enemy; for he will not ceaſe to tempt you, and endeavour to ſurpriſe you, as long as you live in this world; ſo you muſt not ceaſe to watch over your actions and words, that you may reſiſt him always: And that is the reaſon, why the Scripture ſays, <hi>Our Life is a continual Warfare.</hi> Nor muſt you take that Spiritual Diligence for a difficult thing, for it will become eaſie by uſe: and it is moſt neceſſary, uſeful, and profitable, far beyond that of things temporal and corporal; As things dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and eternal, are much more eſtimable, than tranſitory and mortal ones: And yet we ſee the men of the world take ſo much care for the preſent life, which is of ſo ſhort continuance. For a Gentleman will take heed to all his words and actions, that he do or ſay nothing againſt his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation: He hath alſo always his ſpirit occupied to perceive if others carry that Reſpect and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to him, which he deſires; and all his care is intent to perſerve his reputation in this world, neglecting no occaſion to maintain it. He expoſes ſometimes even his life for a point of Honour; or takes away the life of another, of whom he thinks he hath received ſome affront.</p>
            <p>And what care, ſtudy and fatigues do they take who would perfectionate themſelves in ſome Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whether in Divinity, Law, or Medecine? what frequenting of ſchools? How many Books muſt they buy, and how many Maſters muſt they ſeek? And care to obſerve things well, to come to ſome reputation of a learned man? Now though all ſuch Honours be vain and periſhing, yet you know,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:65025:117"/>
my Son, how much care a Merchant muſt adhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit to order his affairs: There are many who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect often their eating and drinking and ſleeping to attend conſtantly their profit. How much care takes a Labourer or Tradeſman, to gain their food? And God gives you yours ſo liberally, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Care or Trouble, that you may the better take care of your Salvation, and labour the more for the perfection of your ſoul.</p>
            <p>Is it then juſt that you ſhould complain of a little difficulty you have to watch over all your words and actions, to find true Virtue and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Snares of the Devil? Methinks that is the leaſt a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> can do to attain to eternal life and happineſs. For man is created for no other end but that happineſs and eternity. If then he is capable (as it appears that he is) to watch &amp; be careful, and labour for things temporal and tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, how much more ought he to do the ſame for eternal things? we ſee that Merchants go by Sea and Land, and put their life in hazard to gain a little Money. We ſee Tradeſmen pained and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by exceſſive labour, and that they do mean, abject and naſty works, to gain their poor nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment. We ſee hired Servants ſubject to the will of their Maſter, and watch and attend with dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence the ſervices they owe them, and that to gain a ſmall wage or fee. And a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> will not do all theſe things, to keep himſelf out of the Snares of his Enemy, and to acquire true Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which conducts his ſoul to eternal life: Were it not a great weakneſs to ſay, that it is difficult to watch always over our words and actions, to become agreeable to God? While we ſee all men doing the ſame thing, upon accounts that no way deſerve it. How much care takes a faithful Page
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:65025:117"/>
to ſerve his Maſter? Hee'l ſtudy almoſt night and day to do what he knows is pleaſing to him: and performs with diligence what he knows to be his will; And when he hath ſerved him well and gained his friendſhip, he obtains nothing but a pitiful tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Wage.</p>
            <p>I have heard a Story related of a Servant, who had faithfully ſerved a Prince, ſo that he was well ſatisfied with him; And for that promiſed that he would give him, whatever he ſhould demand. It happened a long time after that promiſe that the Servant fell ſick, and was in great danger of death, and when he felt himſelf at the extremity, he entreated earneſtly to be viſited by his prince. The Prince being come to his bed-ſide, aſkt him, what he would demand of him. The Servant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, <hi>that he might not die of that diſeaſe, and that he might live yet ſome years.</hi> The maſter Anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; that it was not in his power, and that he muſt demand of him ſomething elſe. After the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant demanded of him one years life, or a Moneths, or in end one days life? But the Prince continued to anſwer, that he could not do what he demanded, ſince it was beyond his power, and that he muſt demand of him things poſſible, as Money, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decines, or other Benefits, that were in his power. But the ſervant replied, that he needed neither Money nor other Service, nor Medecines, which could not prolong his Life one day: And ſo he demanded of him aſſurance of his Salvation, ſince he could not prolong his life; that if he muſt die, he might do it with peace, and in aſſurance to die happy, and to be ſaved. That demand afflicted much the Prince, and made him anſwer, that his Salvation depended upon the Grace and Mercy of God, and conſequently it was not in his power to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:65025:118"/>
and far leſs to give it him. Which grieved the Servant ſo exceedingly, that turning away from his Prince, and turning his face to the wall, he ſaid, <hi>O Miſerable man that I am, have I paſſed all the days of my life to ſerve and pleaſe a Maſter, who is not able to aſſiſt me in my greateſt need, nor give me one hours life? I will not henceforth ſerve ſo impotent a Maſter.</hi> And in that reſolution he made a vow to God, <hi>That if he would reſtore him his health, that he would forſake men, and retire to the Deſert, to ſerve God alone, and attend the perfection of his Soul, and ſo give himſelf to a Lord, that could give him Life and Salvation.</hi> Which he did in effect; for God having reſtored him to health, he retired to the Deſert, and there lived a good life during ſome years, and in the end died well. Does not that Hiſtory open your underſtanding, to underſtand the blindneſs of men, who ſpare nothing in the ſervice of the world; but beſtow therein their care and labour without ſcruple to pleaſe men ſuch as themſelves, or to gain a little earthly Goods?</p>
            <p>For Although that Story were not true: (as I believe firmly that it is) Yet we ſee dayly that every one cares and labours for a little Money, or a little Favour, which they expect from men; though it is moſt certain, that they can give us nothing that's ſolid, and that they leave us at death, not having the power to give us an hour of life.</p>
            <p>Ought we not to have ſhame and confuſion, to ſay or think, that it is difficult to watch always over our Words and Actions to diſcover the Snares of the Devil, and the means to attain true Virtue? While thereon depends our eternal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and there is nothing can concern us ſo nearly as that. For the devil ſnatches all occaſions to
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:65025:118"/>
ſurpriſe us: And if we are not well on our guard, we ſhall not ſpeak one word, nor do one action, whereby he will not cauſe us to ſin, although we do not perceive it. For he will make us ſpeak, what we ought to keep in ſilence; and be ſilent of what we ought to ſpeak; to draw thence his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and to bring diſorder, and confuſion in all, to make us ſin, or others by our means. And therefore, pray I you, to be diligent and to watch over all your actions, that you may overcome the Devil, and arrive at true virtue. Which ſhe wiſhes you, who loving your Salvation, remains forever.</p>

            <head>THE XXI. LETTER. Spiritual Diligence neceſſary, beyond all other Virtues.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>To the ſame; ſhewing him how neceſſary Spiritual Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence is, to confirm the mind in virtue; And to remove yet two Impediments of the Devil, Viz. <hi>(15)</hi> ſins of Omiſſion wherewith the Devil tempts good perſons: and <hi>(16)</hi> ſelf-love, which every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where mixes it ſelf and is a continual ſin.</p>
            </argument>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Son;</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU muſt know that Spiritual Diligence is the moſt neceſſary of all the Virtues, without
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:65025:119"/>
which you cannot perſevere in any Virtue; and the Devil will always labour to cauſe you to loſe them by degrees, if you keep not firmly that of Spiritual Diligence.</p>
            <p>For if he ſee you to have obtained the Virtue of Humility, he will excite occaſions of Pride, as the Praiſes of men, Proſperity in temporal Goods, and ſuch like, to make you loſe your Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, which you have already obtained, by the Grace of God. Be always on your guard then, with Spiritual Diligence, otherways you ſhall inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly looſe Humility, before you be aware. Which befel my ſelf; for after God had given me the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Humility, I felt again Pride riſe in my heart. I felt a diſſatisfaction when men gave me no Title of Honour or Reſpect, but called me ſimply by my Name. I even murmured at their incivility; and though I teſtified nothing of it outwardly, my Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility was notwithſtanding weakened inwardly.</p>
            <p>So that if God had not given me ſpiritual Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, to watch continually over my Soul, I had aſſuredly loſt that comely Virtue of Humility, as alſo that of Voluntary Poverty. For after I was entirely freed from the Covetouſneſs of this worlds Goods, and had effectually forſaken them, I felt covetous thoughts many years after: For certain pious perſons having demanded of me, to put ſome Money in fellowſhip with them in their buſineſſes; which I did with intention to beſtow all the Gain upon the Poor; but after I had made that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, I began to argue with my ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If it was not enough to leave them the half of the Gain, or ſome part of it, and keep the reſt for my ſelf.</p>
            <p>But examining my Conſcience with Spiritual Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, I diſcovered, that the Devil intended by
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:65025:119"/>
that to cauſe me to relapſe into the Covetouſneſs of the goods which by Virtue I had abandoned: Which befel me alſo again after many years. One time while I was at <hi>Malines</hi> about ſome buſineſs, I conceived a deſire to buy ſome Laces (which are made there in aboundance) with deſign to ſell them dearer at <hi>Liſle,</hi> and ſo ſave the expenſe of my Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. Now after I had boughr them, and ſaw ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of gain I thought I might well keep that gain for my ſelf, though I was then in a houſe of poor, which I had undertaken to govern for Charity, and to employ thereon all my Labour and Induſtry, for entertaining thoſe Miſerable Girles, without ſeeking my own particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.</p>
            <p>But the Devil endeavours always to ſurpriſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of a good will by moſt ſubtil ſnares, unleſs they remain firmly fixed in ſpiritual Diligence, and watch over all their words and actions. For though it ſeemeth often that our actions are good, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, and for a good end; yet the Devil furs himſelf therein; and attempts to get his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. And when he cannot gain much, he contents himſelf with little, but yet brings always ſome hurt to the perfection of our ſouls, or that of others. So that we muſt be diligent, that he may gain nothing. For he cannot hurt us when we perceive it, and have our wills fixed on God, and a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to tend to true Virtue. For when we diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the ſnares of the Devil, we ſhall aſſuredly reſiſt them: but if we fall into ſpiritual negligence, hee'l enſnare us in all things; and I believe we ſhall not ſpeak a word, from which he ſhall not draw ſome advantage againſt our ſouls, or thoſe of others. For he will make us be ſilent of what we ſhould ſpeak for our advancement ſpiritual or temporal,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:65025:120"/>
or for the good and edification of our Neighbour. In all ſuch caſes the Devil will play the dumb, and keep us ſilent, when we ſhould ſpeak: At another time hee'l play the Orator, making us ſpeak and diſcourſe, what we ought to be ſilent of, and ſo will draw from our words great ſin. For both good and evil perſons are often offended at our words. If we ſpeak the Truth, they are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to hear it. For it is as a two-edged ſword, and ſo even pious perſons themſelves cannot ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it while it reproves, ſince correction is never agreeable in the time when it is adminiſtred: but if we ſpeak falshood, or ſay any thing to pleaſe men, the wicked as well as the good ſhall be thereby ſtumbled; For our example will fortifie the wicked in their wickedneſs and falshood; and the good shall be offended that we who profeſs Virtue are not true in every thing, and will yet pleaſe the world and worldlings: So that on every hand we give advantage to the Devil; in ſpeaking or keeping, ſilence; And that as long as we have not obtained ſpiritual Diligence, to watch over all our words and actions.</p>
            <p>For if you will, my Child, reflect upon your ſelf, you ſhall experience, that you do or ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without ſinning. But becauſe the Devil holds you yet in Spiritual negligence, you perceive it not but by chance.</p>
            <p>For he obſcures your memory, that you ſhould not remember what's neceſſary; and repreſents to your mind what you ought to forget: And by that makes you do his will, as well in Spiritual as in temporal concerns; for it is indifferent to him by what he enſnares you: But he will be loath to tempt by evil actions, ſuch as ſeek to become Jeſus Chriſt's Diſciples; He tempts them but by Omiſſions, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:65025:120"/>
that they will not follow his ſuggeſtions in evil things, though readily in omiſſions: and ſo he makes them forget, or neglect the things that are for the Glory of God, and the Salvation of their Souls, or that of others. Now he gains much more with good perſons, by theſe Omiſſions, than he could do by actions: ſeeing evil actions diſpleaſe welmeaning perſons, and are reprehenſible before men: And therefore they would not commit them, although the Devil did tempt them; if it were only for avoiding a bad example, or ſcandalizing their Neighbour.</p>
            <p>But ſins of omiſſion are more ſecret and difficult to diſcover, and conſequently more dangerous for ſouls, which have not ſpiritual diligence. For they fall inſenſibly, and without perceiving it in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual negligence; And when they are fallen therein, they often know not that they have ſinned: Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting that neglect to the weakneſs of their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory or infirmity of their Underſtanding; without perceiving, that the Devil occaſions the forgetting of things neceſſary for the ſoul and body of man: which is a ſubtil Snare of Satan. So, my Son, you muſt watch well, leſt he ſurpriſe you igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly. For it will not be enough before God to ſay, <hi>I thought not of it, or I forgot</hi>; Seeing we are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways bound to think of, and remember the things that are neceſſary, and ſalutary: hence is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, <hi>He that ſins ignorantly goes ignorantly to Hell:</hi> And it is ſaid ſomewhere, <hi>That Ignorance does not excuſe Sin.</hi> To ſhew that ſpiritual Diligence is eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially neceſſary for him that would work out his Salvation; and that God admits no excuſes, in what man is oblieged to do.</p>
            <p>I believe among men, every one will be ready to juſtifie and excuſe himſelf; for being all frail and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:65025:121"/>
they flatter and excuſe alſo ſuch as are like themſelves when they love them. Then they attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to fragility what proceeds from ſpiritual ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence; but God who tryes the Reins, and ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches the Conſciences, makes another judgment of our actions and omiſſions. He will condemn for ſin, whatever we have neglected to do, for his glory, and our Salvation, or for the Salvation of others, when it was in our power. It will not be enough to ſay to God: <hi>I have not found;</hi> if you have not done neceſſary duty to ſearch.</p>
            <p>There are perſons ſo imprudent to believe, that God will not take an accompt of them, for what they have not known. In which they shall find themſelves far deceived at Death. For we are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways oblieged to ſearch, what we need to find: And we should abſolutely know the means by which we may arrive at Salvation: as are the Commandments of God and the Goſpel Precepts: And he that performs not what is there ordained, cannot be ſaved. It will not be enough for him to ſay, I did not know what God required, nor the Goſpel-law, ſeeing he is oblieged to know both; and to do all poſſible diligence to learn them, that he may do them. If then we have not that ſpiritual Diligence for our Salvation, we shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver obtain it. For we are oblieged to know what is neceſſary to Salvation: and the ignorance of theſe things will not excuſe the ſin: So much the rather, becauſe Jeſus Chriſt ſays, <hi>Seek and you shall find; pray and you ſhall receive; knock and it ſhall be opened to you.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 John. 12:15.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Which is not to ſay, (as many ignorants alledge) that Jeſus Chriſt hath ſatisfyed all for us: ſeeing he exhorts us to ſeek the Kingdom of Heaven,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:65025:121"/>
to pray, to knock, and to do all that we can to obtain it: Teaching thereby that that ſpiritual di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence is neceſſary to Salvation: And theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade themſelves that they ſhall obtain it by the diligence of another. Which is but a flattery to Deſtroy us: while the Apoſtle admoniſhes us ſo much, <hi>To watch and pray, that we enter not into Tentation.</hi> For if the merits of Jeſus Chriſt had ſatisfied all, what need had we to watch and pray; we needed but to remain in eaſe and quiet, in expecting that Jeſus Chriſt had ſatisfied all for us. Then we needed not to do any thing. For it ſhould be in vain to knock, pray, and ſearch, if all were found and obtained by the merits of Jeſus Chriſt; Which may well let you ſee, my Son, that men are at preſent given up to a Spirit of Error, and that they know not the truth of things: for they make one another believe Falshoods for Truths, and would by their gloſſes annul the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>But that Doctrine excites always unto Spiritual Diligence: for Jeſus Chriſt ſays, <hi>We muſt pray al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, and without ceaſing.</hi> That is to ſay, that we muſt always be diligent to watch over all our words and actions: Otherwiſe we ſhall not ſpeak one word without committing ſin, nor do any action that ſhall not be defiled; ſo long as we remain and live in corrupt nature, wherein we are born.</p>
            <p>For that corruption loving it ſelf turns to its own glory and profit all that we do or ſay: Which is a continual ſin, which we cannot evite but by Spiritual Diligence, or continual Prayer, which is the ſame thing. For being continually attacqued by ſin, we muſt continually combat it, or yield and rendet our ſelves its Slaves: And though there
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:65025:122"/>
were no other Devil, but the Corruption of mans Nature; we behoved notwithſtanding to combat it continually: ſeeing that Corruption is as much an Enemy of our Salvation as the Devil.</p>
            <p>If you will, my Son, examin well your own ſelf, you ſhall find by experience, that you do not one ſingle action which (though good in it ſelf) is not defiled with ſelf-love and ſelf-ſeeking; and that you ſpeak not one word, which you aim not for your own advantage, or praiſe, or to excuſe and juſtifie your ſelf. For Self-love ſearches always his own eaſe and ſatisfaction, and will not have the blame in any thing. Yea it would appear in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent in the moſt manifeſt faults it commits; It ſpeaks to excuſe them, reaſons to maintain its opinions, or what it hath fancyed or undertaken to maintain. In fine, it employs all the forces of body and ſpirit to diſown its guilt. So proud is that corrupt nature, that it will not be blamed in any thing, if it can evite it. Now all theſe things are manifeſt ſins, which rob our heart of the Love and Honour of God, to make us love and eſteem our ſelves; And ſo infring the Command, <hi>To Love God with all our Heart</hi>: while we love our own glory, and eſteem our ſelves with all our heart.</p>
            <p>I have often declared, that the reſſence of ſin conſiſts, in that man retires his affections from God, to place them in any thing elſe beſide him: So we muſt conclude, that man falls ſo often into ſin, as he turns to love himſelf; And he falls ſo often into the love of himſelf, as he will juſtifie or excuſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſince there is nothing juſt or excuſeable in his corrupt nature. It is by ſin become altogether evil; and cannot of it ſelf do any Good, ſpiritual or
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:65025:122"/>
temporal; But is filled with all ſorts of evils, from which no good can proceed.</p>
            <p>That is a truth, to which all the world would readily acquieſce, if they were diſengaged of ſelf-love; for then ſhould they ſee, that <hi>they are ſlow to all good, and bent to all evil.</hi> That they are ignorant, impotent, and in ſhort, all that we do in this life is only to be eſteemed, or to evite the contempt and humiliations that may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal us.</p>
            <p>Which proceeds from that Pride of Life, which ſin hath planted in the bottom of the hearts of all men that come into the world. They bring with them that pride which makes them live in continual ſins, if they do not reſiſt it continually by Spiritual Diligence, and watch not over all their Words and Actions to limit and regulate them by the Law and Will of God; Which cannot be done without that Spiritual Diligence, which ought to rule all our words and actions, if we would attain to Salvation.

               <salute>My Son;</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Cannot over much explain the worth and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of <hi>Spiritual Diligence</hi>; ſince it does oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion your eternal Salvation, and all the good things we attain in this life and that which is to come. Conſider well that neceſſity, that you may apprehend it, and put it into practice; ſince there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon depends your eternal happineſs. For though you had acquired ſeveral other Virtues, yet the Devil could eaſily enſnare you by Spiritual Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; and ſuffer you to do well for a time, that he might enſnare you after.</p>
            <p>He hath not been able to hinder you to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the world, to give your ſelf to the Service of God; ſeeing that was your abſolute reſolution. Neither could he hinder, that you have deteſted ſin, and undertaken to follow true Virtue. But he attends you in the paſſage, that he may ſtop your courſe and hinder your perſeverance by divers tentations, and by occaſions which he will excite, to withdraw you from your good purpoſe. He will excite men of good will to render your
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:65025:123"/>
reſolution ſuſpect, even upon pious pretext. Hee'l make you ſometimes doubt, if you ſhould not do better to remain in the world, and make your Light to ſhine to others, to enlighten them again; he will repreſent to you, if you had not better yet merchandiſe, that you might aſſiſt your Neigbour out of your ſuperfluity or by your good Example. For the Devil tempts by all ſorts of means; and when he cannot bring us to evil actions, he inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuates himſelf into our good works; yea even into our good intentions, and mixes therein ſome of his venom, a little when he cannot much.</p>
            <p>He gives ſometimes a wearineſs in the way of Virtue, and makes appear burthenſom what is in it ſelf light: giving the Soul a backwardneſs or difficulty in well doing, or in overcoming it ſelf. Alſo he takes away the Hope of ſurmounting our imperfections, and arriving at true Virtue, that he may render our ſouls ſlack and lazy, becauſe they ſee not the means whereby to arrive at true Virtue. So that he confounds our ſpirits, that they may not diſcover the truth of things as they are before God: but that they ſhould occupy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves always with apparent Virtues, and curious Speculations. And therefore is it we have need of continual Prayer, and ſpiritual Diligence, if we would perſevere in the ſervice of God, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Devil would gain us by the one or other way, Let us then watch always, that he make not our firſt Fervour cool, and ſlacken our good reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of embracing ſolid Virtue.</p>
            <p>He will attempt, even when we have obtained true Virtue, to lead us into Spiritual Negligence; perſwading us, that we may well reſt at eaſe, ſeeing we have acquired it, and that we cannot advance further. I have known ſuch perſons, as
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:65025:124"/>
ſaid to me, That they were arrived at the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degree of perfection, to which they could attain. And they ſaid ſo becauſe they had read all they could read; And ſo they judged, that to read more, was but to repeat what they had already read and underſtood: Which was to me a great Pride, and a Spiritual Negligence, which the Devil had planted in their heart, to make them periſh by that Negligence. For not to advance in Virtue, is to fall back and recoil; ſeeing man never attains that perfection that he ought.</p>
            <p>It is written in the holy Scripture, <hi>Be ye perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect:</hi> To teach us, that we ſhould tend to the perfection of God, and never reſt in the way of Virtue; but always tend to a higher degree of perfection; even to the laſt moment of our life, to follow the nearer the perfection of our heavenly father. But the Devil, envious of our happineſs, endeavours to his power to divert us. He ſerves himſelf of ſpiritual Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, when he cannot prevail by evil deſires and actions. It is alike to him by what means he enſnare our ſouls, provided he can in the end retain them to himſelf, be therefore upon your guard, my Son; and before all embrace ſpiritual Diligence, as that which is moſt neceſſary for the perſeverance of your Virtue,</p>
            <p>For though there were no other Devil to tempt us, but the Corruption of our Nature, it is ſufficient to give continual exerciſe, to combat it. For it is ſo corrupted by ſin, that it produces continually evil effects in our ſoul, to cauſe it to periſh eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally; We need but follow that nature to be damned, as I have elſe where told you. The reaſon is, becauſe it neither wills nor deſires, but what is evil, and tends to ſelf-love. It is true,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:65025:124"/>
man was created by God perfect, and in that ſtate of perfection he did all good, bleſſing and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring God; and ſo enjoyed every thing without ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: but ſince man abandoned that ſtate of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection by his ſin, he is become ſo corrupted, that whatever he does or ſays, tends only to his own glory, or ſatisfaction, which is to ſin: Seeing all Glory belongs to God alone, and man ought to ſeek nothing, but to pleaſe him; and as often as he does otherways, he offends him: And therefore muſt you have that ſpiritual Diligence, to watch over all your words and actions, except you would live in continual ſins.</p>
            <p>For if we eat and drink, it is ordinarily to pleaſe our taſte, and ſenſuality, inſtead of taking theſe neceſſary things with praiſing the Lord, who made them. If we cloath our ſelves, it is alſo for our own ſatisfaction, eaſe, and glory, inſtead of cloathing our ſelves in humility, and with confuſion, becauſe our ſin made us aſhamed, and neceſſitated us to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our body, to preſerve us from the injuries of the air, which the ſame ſin rendered intemperate in Heat, Cold, and tempeſts.</p>
            <p>For before Sin, man was altogether naked, without shame, and had no neceſſity to cloath himſelf, being cloathed only with Glory and Light. He was Lord and Governour over all the Elements, which were ſubmiſſive and obedient to him, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſing him only for his contentment and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. But now, that is, ſince ſin hath corrupted human nature, man cannot take pleaſure in walking on the Earth, in the refreshing of the Wind or Water, without ſinning; becauſe he does all theſe things, only for his own ſatisfaction, inſtead of doing them to ſatisfie God alone. If man ſtudy, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, or undertake any thing, it is always for his
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:65025:125"/>
own glory and proper ſatisfaction or profit: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of undertaking all theſe things for the Glory of God only; and to apply all the forces of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and powers of his ſpirit, to glorify God, who gave us them.</p>
            <p>He alſo does often glory vainly in the gifts and talents which he hath received of his God, and attributes them to himſelf; as if he were the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietary of them, and independent of the Author of all Good: And ſo forgets what is written, viz. <hi>That every good Gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of Lights.</hi> They come not then from man's power, who inclines to nothing, but to do evil: And conſequently, if man can labour, ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or do any other good and neceſſary thing; theſe are graces and favours, which God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him, and can take from him in a moment. And therefore man hath not reaſon of glorying, or to attribute to himſelf the leaſt good thing; Which he does notwithſtanding, either through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or malice: So he hath need to watch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, if he would abſtain from ſin: otherwiſe he ſhall fall every moment, without percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it.</p>
            <p>For ſince he is corrupted by ſin, he cannot have a good thought, nor ſpeak one word that is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, and mixed with ſelf-love, or ſelf-eſteem: which I could ſhew you, my Son, in your own experience, if you were capable: but all your thoughts and words are mixed with impurity.</p>
            <p>I know well, you are reſolved in the bottom of your ſoul, in general, to pleaſe God, and no more to ſin; yet you do it as often as you ſeek your own ſatisfaction. You do it through ignorance, becauſe you have not ſufficiently diſcovered how much hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature is corrupted by ſin; and you have not
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:65025:125"/>
eſteemed it evil to follow it. On the contrary, you, and all other men, who live according to their corruption, have held it for a good thing, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their own wills, as far as they did not induce them to do any thing evil and reprehenſible before men. For every one walks in his darkneſs, and have no light to know their miſeries, and the ſtate into which ſin hath brought them; And that ignorance makes them live at eaſe in their ſelf-love, without holding it for ſin; though in effect that ſelf-love is the eſſence of all ſorts of ſins.</p>
            <p>For if man kill, ſteal, commit adultery, or do any other thing, forbidden in the commands of God: it is only to ſatisfie his ſelf-love. If he ſeeks his profit, pleaſure, or eaſe, if he eſteem or boaſt of himſelf, it is all to ſatisfie that love; the ſame if he ſeek the honours and pleaſures of this world. In fine, Self-love is the womb in which are engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred all ſorts of ſin; and it entriely robs our heart of the Love of God: Which being pure, cannot remain with the impure love of our ſelves. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is it that it need not appear ſtrange to any, that they cannot obtain the Love of God, though they deſire it: For they can never obtain it, while they continue in the love of themſelves. And they ſhould rather account themſelves unworthy of the Love of God, than raſhly to deſire that God ſhould come to reſide in a heart filled with ſelf-love, and polluted with ſins.</p>
            <p>They that would have the Love of God, and will not forſake that of themſelves, are very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent; ſeeing they would make ſo unſuitable a match, as is that of the Love of God (in which conſiſts all ſorts of good) with ſelf-love (in which conſiſts all ſorts of evil) which is intolerable, and unworthy of good Reaſon: for it is the ſame as if
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:65025:126"/>
they would joyn Heat and Cold in the ſame place, which is contrary to nature, which will never ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that; but theſe two contraries ſhall ſo wreſtle together, that the ſtronger ſhall hold the place alone. For if we put Fire in the Water, it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed, when it cannot overcome the Water: but if the Fire is ſo great that it can conſume the Water, it becomes victorious, and deſtroys the Water.</p>
            <p>It is even ſo with the Soul that deſires the Love of God. It is the place where is the Cold of Self-love, and the Heat of the Love of God: And when that Self-love is the ſtronger, it extinguiſhes entirely the Fire of the Love of God. But if the Love of God kindle more in the Soul, it baniſhes quite Self-love.</p>
            <p>Which arrives unto the purified ſouls, which ſcarce feel any more their Self-love, when that of God hath gotten the upper-hand in the ſoul. They live and die in that love, and deſpiſe Self-love. But he that lives in Self-love, is a Slave of ſin, and commits it upon all occaſions. But he that would evite theſe Perils, should have ſpiritual Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, to watch over all his words and actions, to reſiſt the corruption which ſin hath brought unto human nature; which is ſo corrupted by ſin, that it can produce no more any good, temporal or ſpiritual, ſince retired from the Love of God, wherein is all good; it is fallen into Self-love, wherein is all evil; which produces always its like.</p>
            <p>So that whatever we do by our natural motion, it is altogether evil and ſin: And if you could well comprehend that Truth, as it is, you should al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways diſtruſt your ſelf: and never dare to do or undertake any thing, if you would not do evil,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:65025:126"/>
and fall into ſin. But man's rashneſs, and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance renders him bold, to undertake things ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and temporal: As if he were wiſe and free of corruption; which often precipitates him into great faults and ſins: which they do not perceive until after they are committed; and ſo cannot be helpt, I believe, my Son, that you have often experienced that in your ſelf, without knowing whence theſe faults proceeded, ſeeing your will was to do all well: believe me, they proceed all from ſpiritual negligence, and becauſe you know not yet ſufficiently the corruption of your nature, which you have followed while in the world, you thought your ſelf full wiſe, when you could order your temporal affairs to your profit: You have not perceived, that the Devil could well help you in that; that by procuring you proſperity, he might detain you always in the affection of earthly things; and that you ſhould neglect eternal ones, as other Merchants, of your profeſſion, do yet: Who inſtead of labouring for the Goſpel-pearl, labour to follow the will of the Devil, the Enemy of their ſouls, without perceiving it.</p>
            <p>Yea, they think it a Bleſſing of God that they proſper in temporal Affairs: but it is often a Curſe, ſeeing <hi>God gives his Friends temporal Adverſities, and reſerves for them eternal Joys.</hi> But to men that have done ſome temporal good in this world, but have not overcome the corruption of their corrupt natures, God recompences the temporal good they have done in this world, with temporal proſperities, becauſe God leaves no Good without Recompence, nor Evil without Puniſhment. Wherefore I pray you, my Son, to watch over your ſoul with ſpiritual Diligence, that you let not one word or action eſcape, that proceeds from
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:65025:127"/>
your corrupted nature: ſeeing it produces all ſorts of ſins, which would finally lead you to eternal damnation.</p>
            <p>But labour to reſiſt manfully the corruption of your nature, by a Spiritual Diligence. So you muſt always watch over your words and actions, that the Devil gain you not by ſpiritual Negligence, which ſhe wiſhes you, who loves your ſoul.</p>

            <head>THE XXIII. LETTER Spiritual Diligence is neceſſary to Salvation.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>To the ſame; To whom is ſhewn the Neceſſity of Spiritual Diligence, to watch over all the actions of our corrupt nature, and proper will, and to acquire the Knowledge of our ſelves. Moreover, that Spiritual Negligence, is a Fountain of all Evils, and is alone ſufficient to damn us; becauſe it renders our ſoul rude, and like to a curſed ground, which bears only Thorns and Thiſtles, and ſo, is far from Meekneſs, Lowlineſs, and Humility of Heart.</p>
            </argument>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Son;</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have entertained you largely of the Neceſſity of Spiritual Diligence, which we muſt have in this perilouslife. I have shewn you how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary it is unto Salvation, and that without it
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:65025:127"/>
none can be ſaved, becauſe of the many enemies we have to war againſt.</p>
            <p>I muſt now ſhew you all the Evils, which Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Negligence cauſes; It is a Peſt in the good Air of Virtue: for although you had acquired a great number of Virtues, they could not ſubſiſt in your ſoul without Spiritual Diligence, ſeeing in this world we cannot be free of enemies, who attacque us continually. We might well be for ſome time, in repoſe in Virtue: but that repoſe ſhould be the moſt dangerous combat of our ſouls, which thinking to take reſt, as did the rich man in the Goſpel, who had his Granderies filled; but it was ſaid unto him, <hi>thou Fool, this night thy Soul ſhall be required of thee, and whoſe ſhall then theſe things be?</hi> The ſame ſhall be ſaid to them, who think they have acquired ſo many Virtues, and yet have not Spiritual Diligence. For they ſhall find themſelves deceived at Death, becauſe they have not watched over their Virtues, having ſuffered the corruption of their nature to reign.</p>
            <p>For if you be not Diligent in Virtue, to watch and be aware, that Vain-glory inſinuate not it ſelf; it will take away all the force and merit of your Virtue: Seeing God ſays, <hi>That he reſiſts, the Proud, and that he cares not for Offerings and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices</hi>pb. So he hath no need of our virtue, when it is accompanied with eſteem of our ſelves, or with Vain-glory, as when we artribute any good unto our ſelves; ſeeing we are truely filled with all evils, where is no good. For man's nature is ſo corrupted by ſin, that there remains to him no good ſpiritual or temporal. So that we may with truth ſay, that there remained nothing in man after ſin, but ignorance, malice, and power to do evil. I know my Son; You have to oppoſe, that man
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:65025:128"/>
by his nature can do ſome good; as we ſee the wicked do in regard of their temporal affairs; They gain Money, and aſſiſt their Neighbour. One can Write well, another make Accompts, one can Paint well, another is a good Carpenter, or other Mechanique, which is good and neceſſary for the preſent life: How then can we ſay with truth, that man can do no good, even in temporals: It appears neceſſary that I ſhould explain my ſelf, that I be not argued of falshood; I know that all men in general, and every one in particular<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> believe that they have ſomething good in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and that they can do well according to their knowledge. Which is alſo true in regard of ſome, even imperfect before God; ſuch are they that have the ſkill to exerciſe ſome Art, or Trade which they have learnt. I experienced that in the Girles of my Hoſpital at <hi>Liſle</hi>; for they did very well what I had taught them; Though otherways I knew, that they had given their ſouls to the Devil, and were joyned to him by explicite compact. That did not hinder, that they ſhould learn well to ſew, cleanſe, ſpinn, read and write, and manage Houſholdrey, and ſeveral other things which they did very well. So that it would appear not to be true, which I averred, viz. <hi>That man hath nothing good in him, and can do no good.</hi> For we ſee they do ſeveral goods things, even to the view of men. But you muſt know, that all the good they do, proceeds not from them, but from God, who hath beſtowed it on them by particular Grace and Mercy, or elſe they have learnt it of other men.</p>
            <p>For it is a certain truth, that man hath not of himſelf any thing but ſin, and that he can do no good ſpiritual or temporal; ſince all good comes from God; and all evil from man, and the Devil:
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:65025:128"/>
But when one hath learnt any good from God, he can teach it to his Neigbour. But he cannot have that good of himſelf, becauſe ſin hath filled him with all evil, and deprived him of all good. And we cannot bring out of a thing, what is not in it. For if the Fire were not latent in the Flink, it would not come out, by ſtriking on the Iron, and if Virtue were not in a ſoul, it would not appear upon occaſion. So as it appeared in <hi>Job,</hi> in the midſt of ſo many tentations: For he bleſſed God, ſaying, when he was informed of the Death of his Children, <hi>God gave them, and God hath taken them; bleſſed he his holy</hi> Name. Which was a Grace; which he had received of God, It was planted in his Soul, and ſo produced fruit in its reaſon.</p>
            <p>But he that lives yet in the corruption of his nature, can produce nothing but ſins, and evil, ſince he hath nothing but that in him; and no good can proceed out of his ſoul, becauſe there is none in it. Therefore man is ſottiſh to believe that he can do good temporal or ſpiritual, ſeeing in effect, he ruins whatever he touches, and can do no good, but by the particular Grace of God.</p>
            <p>But becauſe man does not ſufficiently ſtudy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Diligence, that he may come to know him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he eaſily perſwades himſelf, that he is wiſe to do things, ſpiritual and temporal, without no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticing, that his nature is altogether corrupted by ſin. He ſpeaks, works and acts of himſelf, as if he knew to do any good, though all that proceeds from the corruption of our nature is evil.</p>
            <p>Man then ought always to have that diſtruſt of himſelf, that he never follow his own proper will; for whatever proceeds from it is evil; and he that believes not that Truth, ſhall fall into many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:65025:129"/>
and ſins. Therefore is it that Jeſus Chriſt hath taught <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to deny themſelves; and more, he gives himſelf an example of that denial: Saying, <hi>I am not come to do my own Will, but the Will of him that ſent me.</hi> Now if there could in all the human nature, be a good will, it was aſſuredly that of Jeſus Chriſt; and we learn in the Goſpel, that he renounced altogether his own will: Saying to his Father, <hi>Not my Will, but thine be done.</hi> And he ſaid ſo becauſe he knew, that the wills of all men were corrupted by <hi>Adam's</hi> Sin; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently cannot be followed, without doing evil. And therefore Jeſus Chriſt himſelf would not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his own Will, knowing well, that (as to his mortal nature) his own proper will was evil; <note n="*" place="bottom">Which is ſolidly proved in the 2. part of Solid Virtue, letter 6.</note> as are thoſe of all other men, unto whom he would make himſelf like, when he put on our Mortality. Now if Jeſus Chriſt prays his Father, that his proper will, be not done; how much more ought man, corrupted by his own ſins, beſide the corruption of <hi>Adam's</hi> ſin, which all men have contracted from him? It is thence that their wills are become evil; and ſo produce all ſorts of ſins; which we cannot evite, but by a ſpiritual Diligence, watching con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually over the motions of our proper will, that we may reſiſt ſin.</p>
            <p>For if we fall into ſpiritual Negligence, our own will ſhall always have the upperhand, and govern all our words and actions, which ſhall be always evil; and ſo we ſhall commit continual ſins, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out perceiving it; and it is by that ſpiritual negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence alone, that ſouls periſh inſenſibly, and from which all ſorts of evil proceed. We may ſee that Truth in temporal and corporal things; for when they are neglected, they catch always hurt. If we
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:65025:129"/>
neglect a new born Infant, it muſt of neceſſity die for lack of vigilance: If we take not care after to teach it, in ſpeaking, walking and labouring, it ſhall grow up like a Beaſt; and when it is come to the uſe of reaſon, it muſt labour, trade, or ſtudy, if it would ſubſiſt, and have neceſſary aliment. So that, all ſorts of evils ſhould befal it by that negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, in things corporal; and it would even rot and be eaten of Vermin, if neglected to be cleanſed.</p>
            <p>What evils does not negligence bring in civil matters? Countreys and Citties are ruined by want of fore-ſeeing; for if a Lord or Governour of a Countrey, be not diligent to watch over what he hath in charge, his Enemies will ſurpriſe him, and he will loſe his Honout, and Goods, while aſleep. And if the magiſtrate of a City, be not diligent to watch over his Citizens they ſhall forget their duty, and introduce into the Republique evils which after they cannot remedy: and that becauſe they have by their Negligence ſuffered them too long. The ſame is it with the Maſter of a Houſe or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety: If he neglect to watch over his Subjects, he ſhall find himſelf oppreſſed with confuſion, which he cannot redreſs afterward. Negligence in buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, empoveriſhes many, and loſes their Honour by infamous Banquerupts.</p>
            <p>Alſo by Negligence, are loſt the Grain and Fruit of the Earth; when we do not ſow and reap them in due ſeaſon: It deſtroys the Houſhold Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion; brings Ruſt on the Iron; Moths in Cloaths; and Rotting in Linnens, and in fine, negligence brings many Rich Men to Poverty; Diſgraces thoſe that were in Honour and Reputation, it brings damage and evil unto every thing, even to the ſmalleſt things. For if but one ſtitch in your Stoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings ſlip, and you neglect to mend it, that ſtitch
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:65025:130"/>
will quiekly become a great hole, and in the end rent the whole ſtocking, which your Diligence might have preſerved for ſome years. It is even ſo with many other things which diligence preſerves in good order, whereas by negligence they are deſtroyed, and brought to confuſion; yea, it often cauſes death.</p>
            <p>For if a Diſeaſe were well attended at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, it were often eaſily cured: but negligence renders it difficult, and ſometimes incurable; as if a Pleuritique be let blood too late, he muſt die: and if the nature of the ſick be not known to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply timely ſuitable remedies for his indiſpoſition, he muſt die.</p>
            <p>That is the reaſon, that men now adays live ſo ſhort a while, in regard of <hi>Adam</hi> and his ſucceſſors, who lived to ſeveral hunderds of years, becauſe they knew the diſpoſition of nature better; each knew what was good and needful for himſelf on every occaſion: but now, while men are ignorant of Nature, they take often Remedies contrary to their evils, and neglect ſuch as might cure them.</p>
            <p>But this corporal or civil Negligence, though it cauſes ſo many evils, is nothing in regard of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Negligence: Seeing the firſt cauſes only tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and tranſitory evils; and the other, eternal ones. It deprives man of all ſorts of good, and ſubjects him to all ſorts of evil, which is eternal damnation. For he that hath not Spiritual Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to watch againſt the Enemies of his Soul, and for the means he ſhould embrace to his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he muſt perish by that only Negligence, though he committed no other ſin; for it is of our Souls, that the Scripture ſays, in the perfect ſenſe, <hi>The Ground that is not laboured, shall bring forth</hi>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:65025:130"/>
               <hi>Thiſtles and Bryars</hi>: becauſe the ground of our Souls became curſed by ſin, and being fallen into that Curſe, it can no more bear any wholſom fruit, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out beſtowing on it a great Diligence. We muſt trench and till it with the iron of penitence, to tilk the Tares, and bad Weeds of Corruption, which have ſprung up in the earth of our ſouls, For if theſe be not rooted out, they shall ſuffocate al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the good grain of true Virtue, which should thereby be ſtifled, though ſowed in good quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in our ſouls: we muſt maintain it by a continual Diligence, otherwiſe it will bear no fruit; we muſt watch over our Enemies; we muſt always reſiſt the inclinations of that corrupt nature; and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we muſt continually ſtudy the knowledge of our ſelves. For he that knows not himſelf, is ignorant of all, and cannot arrive at the Virtue <hi>to be Meek and Lowly and Humble of Heart</hi> which Jeſus Chriſt ſays, <hi>we should learn of him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No other means can be found than that, he that knows not the Miſeries, Ignorance, and Maledi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, wherein ſin hath brought us, cannot be meek. He shall on the contrary be fierce and arrogant, and preſume to be worthy of honour and eſteem: which shall alſo take away and hinder his Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs toward his Neighbour; and alſo his Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Heart. For he that knows not himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thinks he hath need of no perſon, and conſequently will not be meek nor kind toward his Neighbour; and yet leſs Humble of Heart: which comes for want of knowledge of his Miſery, and the miſerable eſtate into which ſin hath reduced him: and ſo he cannot humble himſelf, according to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Jeſus Chriſt which is ſo good and ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, unto which I exhort you, my Son, that

               <p>To the ſame; advertiſing him, that the continuation of that Subject is interrupted by the Devils exciting the Wiſe of this World, Enemies of Virtue, and Friends, of corrupt Nature, to diſtract the mind of the Writer by their diſputes, Lies and Calumnies, and all manner of Perſecutions.</p>
            </argument>

            </opener>
            <p>I have yet many things to ſay to you, of ſolid Virtue: but the time is wanting to me at preſent, ſeeing my Enemies are all <hi>earning</hi> to hinder it. I doubt not but it is the Devil, our common Enemy, who will not ſuffer that we ſpeak of ſolid Virtue Beſide, he keeps men at preſent in ſpiritual Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, with apparent Virtues; and they take them for ſolid and true ones, therefore would he make them reſt in the Love of themſelves, without arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at ſolid Virtue.</p>
            <p>Now while he cannot hinder that I should diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it, becauſe God diſcloſes it to me; he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to his power to hinder its being published: He induces divers perſons to write againſt me, to take up my time, in anſwering them; and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain me with matters of Contention, inſtead
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:65025:131" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of that of ſolid Virtue. Which bereaves me of my time, and gives me the diſpleaſure of leaving this Treatiſe of ſolid Virtue. Yet I muſt apply my ſelf to repel the Calumnies and Lies which they have diſperſed againſt me in divers places. As ſome in England have alſo done,</p>
            <p>So I was obliged to write a Large advertiſment againſt them; for if I did not give teſtimony to the truth, againſt ſo many fall accuſations and ſies, which they've made; I should be guilty of the ſin which theſe falſe accuſations produce; and should be the cauſe, that good perſons did not follow the Truths which I propagate from God. For ſo many falſe reports would render them ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect; the rather when I am not attacqued by the common people; but by the miniſters and learned, which are eſteemed worthy of credit.</p>
            <p>Theſe wiſe and learned ſtrive at preſent to kill the ſpirit of Jeſus Chriſt, as ſuch like before killed his body; you have ſeen the defamatory treatiſe, which <hi>John Berckendal,</hi> in name of the Miniſters of <hi>Calvins</hi> Reformation, in <hi>Altena,</hi> hath compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed againſt me. And I was obliged to give te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony to the truth, againſt ſo many falshoods, by a great Teatiſe; whereto are joyned the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of a great many perſons, yet alive, and worthy of credit. That work hindered me from writing more to you of ſolid Virtue: though I know that to be very profitable and neceſſary for you, and for all that deſire and aſpire at becoming <hi>true Chriſtian</hi> as you do.</p>
            <p>There are at preſent ſo many perſons deceived by apparent Virtues, and who learn always and never come to the knowledge of the Truth. They think they are already in true Virtue; whereas they are yet altogether in the love of themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:65025:132" rendition="simple:additions"/>Therefore is the Devil ſo angry, when I write of true Virtue; leſt the Deceit of the falſe be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by the true. But the Devil cannot hinder me to know it, ſince God diſcovers it to me: ſo he attempts to bereave me of the time to write it, that neither you, nor other ſouls that aſpire after it, should know it. That is the cauſe why he incites divers perſons to write againſt me, that ſo I may not have time to write of ſolid Virtue. He labours to occupy me always in oppoſing Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers. But he deceives himſelf: for among the refutations of the calumnies of my Enemies, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termix always ſomething of ſolid Virtue. It ought to be unto you, My Son, a Diſcipline to regulate well your life, and become a true diſciple of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Examin well then all that comes from my pen, and you shall always find therein more and more enlightning and wholſom inſtruction; which you shall find principally in the (23) Letters which I have written laſt to you, concerning the words of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly, and humble of heart:</hi> all that matter shall ſuffice for aliment to your ſoul, until I can write more unto you, which I shall do when I have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered two treatiſes, which the Diſciples of <hi>Laba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die</hi> have compoſed againſt me. I have not yet had leiſure to read them; but I conjecture that they shall be, as the reſt, full of Errors and Calumnies. And that, becauſe all they that follow the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of corrupt nature, are in error and falshood, and are not in quiet nor at peace with the Truth; becauſe theſe are two contraries, which always exclude one th'other. And therefore is it, that all theſe learned Schollars oppoſe the doctrine which I advance. It is not ſuch as they have learnt in the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:65025:132" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Schools, beſid<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> neither will they approve any thing but what maintains them in Honours, Profit, Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and Commodities of this life. To which the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt is quite contrary: For it ſpeaks of nothing but poverty, Contempt, ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, and Perſecution for Righteouſneſs ſake; And by conſequence, the Doctrine of the learned now adays, is altogether Antichriſtian; that is to ſay, contrary to that of Jeſus Chriſt. Not that their words are diſſonant; for they read the ſame Goſpel which Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles taught; but they gloſs and explain ſo the words of the Goſpel, that they bring forth a quite perverſe ſence; Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they live in quiet; though all their actions, manners, and deſires be quite contrary to the Goſpel Doctrine.</p>
            <p>For every one now idolizes his own proper will; And Jeſus Chriſt ſaid, <hi>That we muſt renounce it.</hi> Methinks all <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> is become at preſent the people of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> which adored the great <hi>Diana</hi>; with this difference, that <hi>Chriſtians</hi> now adays adore the <hi>Corruption of the fleſh,</hi> whereas thoſe adored a <hi>Statue of gold or Silver.</hi> For we ſee theſe learned ſtrive who can beſt find out ſubtil Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by which they may flatter men in their ſins, or perſwade them, that they may well follow the motions of their corrupt nature, and withall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to Salvation; So that every one follows that Doctrine, without perceiving that it is evil.</p>
            <p>That is the reaſon, <hi>why every one adores that Diana of corrupt nature as a Goddeſs;</hi> And ſo they beſtow all their time and goods to nouriſh, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and ſatisfie corrupted nature. And more, they think, there is no evil in ſo doing, while the miniſters and learned do the ſame; and promiſe Salvation to the people that live in that Idolatry.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:65025:133"/>But they ought to teach in effect, the mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of their ſenſes, the corruption of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, how much it is ruined by ſin, and finally, the neceſſity of denying our ſelves, to be ſaved; as Jeſus Chriſt taught by word and works.</p>
            <p>But theſe ſavage Paſtors will not teach ſo unto their flocks; and will yet leſs put it in practice themſelves; Yea, nor will not ſuffer another to teach theſe <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Truths. It is for that, they purſue me every where, and would gladly exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate me becauſe I have written of true Virtue. The ſame befel St. <hi>Paul</hi> by them of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> who would exterminate him, when he taught the truth: Saying one to another, <hi>That they ſhould loſe their gain if they ſuffered</hi> Paul <hi>to continue preaching Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> That he would ruin the worſhip of the great <hi>Diana,</hi> and cauſe that the Goldſmiths ſhould gain no more in the Workmanſhip of the Image of <hi>Diana.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It goes juſt ſo with theſe learned ones, who are as the maſters of the great <hi>Diana</hi> of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature; which every one adores for his own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. But the Learned are the Maſters, to gain Money by the worſhip and adoration of corrupt nature: So they ſpeak and teach the people ſuch things as pleaſe their corruption; and endeavour to pleaſe men, that they may receive advantages of them, which they will not loſe.</p>
            <p>When then I begin to ſpeak of true Virtue, they are all allarmed againſt me, as they of <hi>Epheſus</hi> were againſt St. <hi>Paul</hi>: But theſe learned take alſo the Judges to their aſſiſtance, and perſecute me, that I ſhould be baniſht, or be diſcharged to write or ſpeak of true Virtue. Some wiſh me dead, others burnt, others that I were thrown in the midſt of the Sea, that I might ſpeak no more of
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:65025:133"/>
ſolid Virtue, and ſo their gain and trade be not diminiſht, and their ſhops become unfrequented; that is, that they ſell no more their frivolous Diſcourſes to pleaſe men. It is that, which at laſt allarm'd them ſo at <hi>Flensburg,</hi> whither I had gone about ſome buſineſs; for the Miniſters no ſooner had any ſuſpicion, that I was in their Town, but they preached in divers Churches, that I am an arrant and pernicious perſon, that I have a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliſh Doctrine, and finally no perſon ſhould lodge me.</p>
            <p>So that I behoved to come out ſecretly, leſt I ſhould be maſſacreed by the Rable and Children: whom the preachings of the Miniſters had ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated againſt me: For they had ſpoken of me with great ſpite and horrours, proclaming publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that my Doctrine is worſe than that of the <hi>Jews</hi>: Adding beſide, that my doctrine is a maſs of all the old Hereſies that ever were in the world.</p>
            <p>Yet I will not teach any thing, by my Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings or Diſcourſe, but what Jeſus Chriſt taught; And if there is any thing contrary to that in them, I deteſt and revoke it; as I have often offered to revoke, all that they would ſhew me to be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the holy Scripture.</p>
            <p>But it is not for Errors they perſecute me, or any evil in my Writings; ſeeing they can ſhew me nothing ſuch therein, They perſecute me then becauſe I declare truely, what is true Virtue, and how a true <hi>Chriſtian</hi> ſhould live, to be a Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Jeſus Chriſt. I know well they mask theſe things; ſaying, <hi>that there are Errors in my Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings:</hi> But no perſon ſhews me theſe errors. They know not what to ſay, to contemn the truths which I maintain; For the Learned ſaid firſt, <hi>that</hi>
               <pb n="208" facs="tcp:65025:134"/>
               <hi>I bring nothing of new; and that they taught and preached tho ſame things twenty years agot</hi>: But when they ſaw in the Book entituled, <hi>The teſtimony of the Truth,</hi> particulars and truths more clear in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Myſteries, than thoſe they learnt in the Schools; they ſay preſently <hi>that they are Errors; and that never any perſon wrote ſuch things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that, it behoved, that God ſhould regulate all according to their ſtudies; And ſhould not give any new Graces to men now adays: But that he ſhould meaſure his Light by the rule of their ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtique doctrine; and ſhould, not ſend the <hi>Holy ſpirit, promiſed by Jeſus Chriſt who ſhall teach all Truths.</hi> Men then reſiſt that Holy ſpirit, and will not hear of other Truths, but thoſe they have learnt in the Schools.</p>
            <p>It is every lamentable to ſee men ſuch enemies of their eternal Happineſs, in rejecting the Light of the Truth, which comes in this laſt time: as the Prophets of God have fore-told: <hi>That he will pour out his Spirit on all fleſh, and that your Sons and Daughters ſhall prophecy, and the Old Men ſee Viſions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now becauſe I repeat the ſame things, with many others from God, they would kill me, as was done to the ancient Prophets: they think to hinder by that, that true Virtue ſhould be known and far more, practiſed.</p>
            <p>But though they should kill me, the Spirit of God shall not die for that; And rhe Truth ſhall always be true. For if I should not ſpeak it, the Dead would ſpeak or the Stones, to declare it unto men: And tho, theſe Miniſters put me to death; God hath yet more than a hunderd millions of perſons, whom he can uſe to declare the ſame Truths, which I advance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:65025:134"/>And therefore, my Son, I exhort you to retain them well, and put them in practice: for though I were not in the world, you muſt nevertheleſs ſave your own ſoul; coſt what it will, if you will enjoy God to all eternity. Which ſhe wiſhes you with all her heart, who loves your Happineſs.</p>

<pb n="211" facs="tcp:65025:135"/>
teach us all Truths, ſeeing you diſcern not yet well Evil from good, and love all indifferently by a natural goodneſs, as did <hi>Adam,</hi> who knew very well the Conſolation and Quiet which a Soul finds in entertaining it ſelf with God; but knew not what Evil was, becauſe he had never proved it. He was created in Pleaſures and Delights, and converſed with his God, in peace; without appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending the Evil which might come upon him, in abandoning God to pleaſe himſelf with the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; And therefore did he ſo eaſily fall into ſin, before he perceived the Miſchiefs and Miſeries it would cauſe him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And almoſt the ſame is befallen you, my dear Brother; for when you enjoyed ſweet enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment with God, you remained in the ſenſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of corrupted nature, by which you have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly loſt commerce with God; becauſe ſo ſoon as he ſees one take pleaſure in any thing elſe but himſelf, he retires by little and little, and leaves the Soul to live to it ſelf, which precipitates it ſelf often into divers Evils, becauſe our proper will engenders death, ſince it was corrupted by ſin.</p>
               <p n="3">3. You did love Good, and do yet love it, but you have not enough hated Evil, becauſe you did not well know it, perſwading your ſelf, that you did well enough, when you ſupported it in others, not perceiving that we can ſin in another nine ways; the <hi>Firſt</hi> is in Conſenting thereto: 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, in Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it; 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. in Tolerating it: 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, in Aſſiſting it: 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, in Defending Evil: 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, in Commanding it: 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, in Partaking with it: 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, in not Hindering it when in our power: 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, in Hiding it from him that would hinder it.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:65025:136"/>4. All theſe are not enough conſidered, and we eaſily fall into them without conſidering it. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we deſire to pleaſe God, the Devil often ſurpriſes us by ſins without us, when he perceives that he cannot prevail to get us to commit them in our ſelves; for he hath as much power over us by the ſins which we commit in another, as by them we commit in our ſelves; ſeeing they ſhall both alike be imputed to us; and if I did not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſe you of it, you might eaſily fall into them without perceiving it.</p>
               <p>For example; you converſe with perſons that are avaritious, proud, or ſtained with any other ſins: they ate ſubject and inferiour to you as your Wife and Children, or your Men or Maid-ſervants: or Hirelings, or whoever they be over whom you have authority, notwithſtanding leſt you ſhould diſpleaſe them, or loſe their friendſhip, you conſent to their committing of ſin, without Daring or will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to reſiſt it. All theſe ſins which are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with your conſent, shall aſſuredly be imputed as if you had committed them your ſelf: To coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel to do evil, that you will not ſo long as you fear God; but for ſuffering it, in others I doubt you do it ſometimes, becauſe you have not enough of hatred to ſin; as when you ſee one deceive in ſelling to or labouring for you, and yet continue to buy of him or employ him in labour, that is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly to ſuffer the evil which he commits.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It were better to be in neceſſity, without dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with them that ſell or labour by Avarice, Fraude or Deceit; for the Soul is more precious than the Body, which ought rather to endure its neceſſities, than to ſupply them to the prejudice of its ſoul, which is aſſuredly defiled by ſuffering
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:65025:136"/>
the ſins of another, and yet more by aſſiſting and helping evil, as he that would give goods to one that is Avaricious, Gluttonous, Proud, Slothful or a Drunkard, would aſſiſt him to go on in his ſins, and commit more with the Gifs and aſſiſtances he affords him: and if we defend or excuſe the Evil of another, we alſo become guilty of the ſame; for we ought never to excuſe or defend it, leſt we ſo maintain the Evil-doer in his ſins, to commit which our corrupt Nature needs no encouragment, and whoever affords it, is partaker of the ſin of the other. Although it is commonly ſaid, <hi>That we should excuſe the Faults of other, and aſſiſt Sinners</hi>; that is a falſe Theologie, very hurtful to the Upright, who are often deceived by Evil for lack of knowing it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Alſo you are not in hazard to <hi>command</hi> Evil, ſo long as you fear God, neither would you ever partake with manifeſt ſin, as with Robbery; for God hath delivered you by his Grace from Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice; Yet you muſt take care to hinder evil when in your power, or elſe the omiſſion would render you partaker of the Evil committed; and even ſo when you do not declare it to them that would hinder it. All theſe ſins or part of them may be committed by good men, who aſpire after Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, particularly when they are of a good diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition naturally they take all in good part.</p>
               <p>I have ſometimes ſlipt into ſome ſuch Faults by too much natural goodneſs or human regard; but after God ſhewed me clearly theſe ſins which we commit in another, which I impart to you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I love your perfection as much as my own by a true <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Charity; ſeeing that you aſpire unto its perfection, which I will alſo shew wherein it conſiſts; for the darkneſs of this world is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:65025:137"/>
ſo great, that the ſouls that are well enclined know nor whither they walk in regard of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, taking often the falſe for true, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect for perfect, and that becauſe they have now taught ſo many divers means to perfection, that one knows not which to take for the ſureſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Of Religions and external pious exerciſes,</note> One ſays we muſt go frequently to Church, and frequent the Sacraments. Another places <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Perfection in entering into ſome Religious Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity or Convent. Others in faſtings and Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating the Body. All theſe things were Good if well uſed, but theſe are not the end, nor that wherein <hi>Chriſtian</hi> perfection conſiſts; For theſe may be performed by them that shall never attain to ſalvation: becauſe no external thing perfects the ſoul, nor can they defile it. They are only the means whereby we more eaſily attain to virtue, or by abuſe fall more eaſily into ſin.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Every Soul in particular ought to uſe the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal means which excites them moſt to <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> Virtue; and evite alſo things that engage them unto ſin; for it is written, <hi>Whoſo loveth hazard, shall perish in it.</hi> So that he that feels himſelf ſo weak in Chaſtity that he hath not the force to look upon Woman, without luſt, he ought not to look upon one; and he that drinks drunk when he hath Wine, ought alſo to abſtain from it: and ſo of all other things, though in themſelves they be not evil, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of our infirmity they cauſe Evil; as others occaſion Good and Virtue in our Soul, when theſe means of perfection are uſed for their end.</p>
               <p n="9">9. For example, if you find by a true experience, that you are more united to God in going to Church,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:65025:137"/>
or frequenting the Sacraments; you are obliged to uſe theſe means as much as poſſible: For every one ought always to ſeek his own further perfection: but if thoſe means effect nothing in your ſoul, you ſhould not uſe them; and if you return better into God, in being shut up in your Cloſet, you are obliged to remain there, and not divert your ſelf by going to Church; and if your Soul feels more union with God in Solitude than when you ſeek that union by frequenting the Sacraments, you ought to keep you ſolitary, and there feaſt inwardly with your God; for <hi>a Good Conſcience is a Continual Feaſt</hi>; where the ſoul repoſes and recreates it ſelf with his God. And therefore it hath not always need of external means to excite it ſelf to that Union.</p>
               <p n="10">10. For often God prevents it with a ſpiritual joy and Contenrment: without that it knows whence that Joy had its origin; for God is a Spirit no ways tyed to material things, neither to Time, Places, nor any means whatſoever; he being a Spirit, and the Soul a Spirit, they comunicate in ſpirit: and he that hath need to ſeek God in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Religions and Fellowſhips, is not very far advanced in the Knowledge of God, and knoweth not yet the place where he feedeth at Noon, nor where he reſteth at Night: for if he knew that, he would not run from one Religion to another to find God; but would remain fixed in himſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>the Center of our Hearts</hi> is the Palace of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, where God reſts and takes his delights. All the Fraternities and Religions in the world cannot give that <hi>Union with God</hi>; we muſt find it in our ſelves; and though the perfecteſt Societies, may well ſerve as means to lead us to <hi>Chriſtian-perfection,</hi> yet they cannot ſave us without the inward Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</p>

<pb n="220" facs="tcp:65025:140"/>
human Conſiderations, <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Math. 6. v. 2, 3.</note> which can never be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſed in eternity, becauſe we have here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their Reward. What we do by Self-love is recompenſed by our ſatisfaction: and what we do by human Conſiderations is recompenſed by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency of men: ſo that we can never in juſtice pretend any thing elſe, being fully ſatisfied in this World after the pretenſions and ends which we have had in doing our good works. Although they have been covered with the cloak of the Glory of God, or Charity toward our Neighbour, all hath been in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect but vanity. Therefore is it that he who will be converted, muſt aſſume <note n="(b)" place="bottom">Rom. 6. v. 4.</note> a life wholly new, and believe that he hath never done one only action purely for the Love of God. Which he ſhall know ſufficiently by examining all the ſins againſt the Holy Spirit, and them which we commit in another, with the eight Beatitudes, and the other ſolid Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. Every one may thereby ſee how far he is alienated from the ſtate of the Bleſſed, which Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt hath declared in theſe eight Beatitudes; and if he hath the will to acquire them, how he muſt take up a wholly new life, and become as a Child newly born, who ſuffers himſelf to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by his heavenly Father. Neither age nor learning can hinder that we abandon our ſelves unto God, ſuffering our ſelves to be ruled as it pleaſeth him: becauſe the more we are advanced in age, the more muſt we make haſte to recover our Salvation, becauſe we have but the ſmall time that our life endures. The converſion of perſons in age ſhould not be deferred one day, leſt their life eſcape, and there be no more recovery, becauſe <note n="(c)" place="bottom">Heb. 9. v. 27.</note> after death there is no more remiſſion.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ſaid unto her, That it was very deſirable to be of the number of them who ſhall be converted; and that I would be the firſt to abandon my ſelf wholly unto God as a little Child.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid</hi>: Sir, no perſon can be entirely conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted if he do not know the ſins; and alſo the true vertues. Theſe two things are neceſſary: For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe men ſhould think they were converted, while they were yet full of ſins, and had not yet acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red any ſolid Virtues. Therefore is it that I have ſpoken unto you ſo particularly, that you ſhould not remain in the darkneſs which invirons all the men in the World.</p>
               <p>There ſhould yet be found many who would turn and be converted: but very few who know their internal ſins, and yet fewer who know what true Virtue is. All theſe would make converſions falſe before God: for if they do not know their hidden ſins, they cannot amend them; and if they do not know what true Virtue is, they cannot practiſe it. The ignorance of theſe two things hinders that they cannot be converted unto God, nor yield themſelves to be governed by him.</p>
               <p>That then muſt be learned firſt of all, to know the ſtate of their Soul, in what degree of ſin it is, and alſo in what degree of true Virtue. If theſe things were known, there ſhould be yet many who would embrace the ſpirit of penitence, and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don themſelves unto God as little Children: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they know not the ſtate of their Conſcience,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:65025:141"/>
many periſh inſenſibly, <note n="(f)" place="bottom">Iſ. 5. v. 13.</note> not knowing their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries. If you will, Sir, be abandoned unto God as a Child, think that all that you have done hitherto is of no value; and caſt your ſelf <note n="(g)" place="bottom">Pſ. 37. v. 5.</note> in Gods Arms, who is your Father, as a Child who cannot ſpeak, that he may teach your every thing. He ſhall do it aſſuredly: For it is his deſire, <note n="(h)" place="bottom">Ezek. 18. v. 23.</note> that we be converted unto him: when we withdraw from him by our ſins, he ſuffers it, becauſe he will not retract the free will which he hath once given us: for he is <note n="(i)" place="bottom">Rom. 11. v. 29.</note> immutable in all his works: but ſo ſoon as we return unto him by penitence, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives us as the father did his prodigal Child, <note n="(k)" place="bottom">Luk. 15. v. 24.</note> accepts us for his Child, and Heir of his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. But if you think to continue in your proper wiſdom, you ſhall never receive the Holy Spirit: You muſt become ſimple as a Child, and not will any more to uſe your proper will, remitting and repoſing it wholly in Gods hands, giving him the reins of your proper will, that he may guide it, and conduct it whither he pleaſeth, and that you may no more be able to abuſe it, as hitherto you have done: which you muſt confeſs with regret: for if our will had been ruled by God, we had never come into ſuch Extremities of all Evils.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ſaid unto her, That I muſt confeſs that my will had not been ruled by God, becauſe I had not known as at preſent the manner of abandoning my ſelf unto God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, no man can ever be ſaved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he know that he muſt be entirely abandoned unto God: becauſe that is the firſt and laſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment which he hath given unto man: and to ſpeak better, it is the only thing which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of man. If we would abſolutely depend upon
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:65025:141"/>
God we ſhould fulfil all the Law and the prophets. That is the only thing neceſſary. All that I can ever have ſaid, Sir, is comprehended in the DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PENDANCE which we ought to have upon God, becauſe he hath never required any thing elſe of man, (and alſo ſhall never for the future ſo long as the world laſts) but that dependance which he owes unto God. It is a very ſmall matter that he requires of us. It is alſo great ingratitude <note n="(l)" place="bottom">Deut. 32. v. 6.</note> that we deny him that <hi>Dependance</hi> upon him: ſeeing he is the Lord and Creator of every thing, that he hath created us of nothing, and giveth all that we have, to enjoy it in full liberty, provided on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we have always the acknowledgment that we depend upon him in every thing. Could that great God demand leſs of a little Earth-worm, than the acknowledgment of the <hi>Dependance of his God?</hi> It is athing ſo juſt, that although God had never teſtified that he deſired that of Man, he was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged always to acknowledge it; ſeeing all came truely-from him, and he had enriched him with ſo many Graces and Prerogatives, which obliged him unto a continual acknowledgment, even al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he had never had more than a natural rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: for they ſay, that brute and cruel Beaſts have acknowledged ſome good deed of men all the days of their life; and man with an underſtanding ſo compleat will not acknowledge the <hi>Dependance</hi> which he hath upon God, nor ſubmit his will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto that of God, although he be ſo good <note n="(m)" place="bottom">Prov. 23. v. 26.</note> as to deſire it: for if God were not an Exceſs of Goodneſs, he would rather diſdain men, of ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle worth, than to permit them to unite their will unto his. Nevertheleſs he permits and deſires it, yea threatens and rejects them who will not do it, as

                  <note n="(n)" place="bottom">John. 3. v. 8.</note> when he would not be waſhed by him. If we had but a very little judgment, we ſhould ſay unto God, that he ſhould not permit only our will to be united unto his; but rather, that ours ſhould be wholly annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and he exerce his over us only and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I asked her, How ſhe underſtood that, in ſaying,</hi> That the acknowledgment of the Dependance of God, was the only Commandment of God, <hi>ſeeing he hath made ſo many divers ones.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, there is only that Commandment alone eſſential; all the others are accidental. For when God had created <hi>Adam,</hi> and all men in him <note n="(o)" place="bottom">Pſ. 8. v. 7.</note> he gave him the power over all ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate things, having ſubjected all living Creatures unto him, that he might rule over all as a little God, without reſerving any thing, but that he ſhould always acknowledge the dependance which he had upon his Creator; beſide that, that he might, rule over every thing as a Dependent Deity: and to denote that Dependance, he forbids him to eat of the fruit of one only Tree; permitting him to taſte all the others: which ſignified, that man might uſe, enjoy, and rule over every thing, provided that he always acknowledged his dependance upon that ſupreme Deity, of whom he held every thing: and if <hi>Adam</hi> had not forgotten himſelf, in forſaking that Dependance, to depend upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he had never received any other Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from God, nor all other men after him; but the Juſtice of God was obliged to make other Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments unto him for Penitence of his Diſobedience: he enjoins him <note n="(p)" place="bottom">Gen. 3. v. 17, 19.</note> 
                  <hi>to labour the Earth, and gain his living with the ſweat of his face</hi>; which was the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:65025:142"/>
Cummandment which God made unto man, which yet is only accidental by <hi>Adam's</hi> fall, and not eſſential by the Will of God, who loved well to ſee him free, without ſubjecting him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any thing but himſelf alone.</p>
               <p>And when he made the Commandments given unto <hi>Moſes</hi> for the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that was alſo by accident; for if they had not forgot themſelves in ſo many divers ſins, which withdrew them from the Dependance of God, he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver given them divers Commandments; but fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leſt his People ſhould periſh through Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, he gave them always Commandments, that by means of them they might know their ſins, and amend them, otherwiſe God had never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained man unto any thing elſe, but to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him as ſuperiour of all thing: becauſe God had created him to <note n="(q)" place="bottom">Prov. 8. v. 31.</note> take his delights with him, in full liberty, and without conſtraint, not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſubject him unto any other Law than that <note n="(r)" place="bottom">Cant. 2.4.</note> of Love: whence appears that all theſe other Commandments are but accidentally appointed, becauſe of the ſins which men have committed in divers times, who if they would yet at preſent reaſſume that Dependance upon God, they ſhould not need all the other Commandments nor Precepts: becauſe all are but means to attain unto that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance of God; and that we might ſee and know all the things which hinder us to abandon our Will unto that of God; and that knowing them by the Commandments, we might remove and correct them, that we might be able to enter again into that Dependance which was firſt enjoyned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, as the only thing neceſſary unto our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: as it is yet at preſent even as then.</p>

                  <hi>I ſaid unto her, That it was very agreeable to hear that there was but one only thing to be done to be ſaved; that I would gladly take that ſhort way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid</hi>: No, Sir, <note n="(ſ)" place="bottom">Luk. 10 42.</note> there is nothing but one only thing to be done for Salvation: but there are many to be omitted, which give us great Impediments and Diſturbances. We omit to do what ſerves us as means to arrive at that Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and we do what mars it. The Penitence which God gave unto <hi>Adam</hi> to gain his living with the ſweat of his face, is very little obſerved by men at preſent. Every one will live without la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring, and they account it a happineſs to have Riches to live at eaſe. That is very far to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the means which God hath taught us ſo ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily. After <hi>Adam</hi> had ſinned, and all men in him, he had by his free will departed from that Dependance upon God, to become wiſe of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: he had rendered himſelf with all his Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity miſerable: becauſe all the Miſeries which we endure are engendered by willing to do our own will. We muſt not impute all our Miſeries unto <hi>Adam,</hi> but only unto our own faults, which we our ſelves commit. If we had only <hi>Adam's</hi> Sin, we ſhould only have the Penitence to <hi>labour for our living,</hi> and <hi>endure the Intemperance of the Elements</hi>;
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:65025:143"/>
but our own ſins cauſe unto us a thouſand other ſorts of ſufferings. If we would labour, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure heat and cold, or other intemperances of the ſaid Elements, and remit the Dependance of our Will unto that of God, <note n="(t)" place="bottom">Pſ. 81. v. 14, 17</note> we ſhould quickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into the bleſſed ſtate wherein <hi>Adam</hi> was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; for our Penitence ſhould be accompliſhed in this ſhort life, which is much ſhortened by the Mercy of God; and then we ſhould enjoy an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal beatitude, which ſhould never end: but ſince our proper actual Will would not depend upon God, but upon it ſelf, following its proper incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, it hath cauſed us many other Evils, which we attribute unto God, or unto <hi>Adam</hi>; and if we regarded them truely, we ſhould ſee that they take their origin and reign from our proper Will, and nothing elſe: For our diſeaſes are often cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by our intemperance in Eating and Drinking, or other Exceſſes of the body, which we commit to ſatisfie our proper Will, which precipitates us ſometimes into ſome ſtate that cauſeth us a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pains, or ſome Employment, or Traffique, which lead us into great Troubles of Proceſſes, Quarrels, Diſquiets, or other Poverties and Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: And all that proceeds from that we would not ſubmit our Will unto that of God, who would have ruled us as a good Father his Child, having loved rather to follow our own Will, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go all manner of Calamities in this world, and be in peril of ſuffering after greater ones, which ſhall never end: becauſe he that will not be guided by God, can never be ſaved: ſeeing our proper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct ſhall lead us into abyſes of all manner of Evils, temporal and eternal: becauſe our proper Will is ignorant, precipitant, never ſatiated nor
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:65025:144"/>
ſatisfied, not ſtaying for any ſorts of Evils: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it diſcover its Miſeries, it does not amend them, but attributes them unto another, to <hi>Adam,</hi> or elſe to God: and ſo flattering themſelves al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in their own Will, they perſiſt therein un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til Death, which gives beginning unto eternity of Miſery: becauſe no perſon can be ſaved of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and if they will not give their Will unto God, from whom can they expect Salvation? It is great blindneſs, Sir, not to know theſe Truths, which are ſo evident; ſeeing we feel our impotency, and know that we have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved all from God, and cannot hope for any thing but from him. And with all theſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, we will not abandon our Will into his, loving rather to be miſerable and periſh in the end by following our own.

univerſal Darkneſs which is at preſent in the world: Every one imagins to himſelf that he will abandon himſelf unto God, when there is nothing like it: for if that were true, we ſhould not ſee men ſo earneſt to negociate, or traffique, nor run through Cities and Countrys to gather Money, nor alſo to ſolicit for of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, ſtates, or benefices; becauſe every one remitting himſelf into the Dependance of God, would la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to have only his neceſſities, and no more, knowing well that this life is ſhort, and that the neceſſity ſufficeth unto a Sojourner, who will be loath to burthen himſelf with things uſeleſs or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous unto his Voyage, which would be a burthen to him. All mens Cares, Goings &amp; Comings, or pretenſions for things preſent, are as many Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which affirm that they will not abandon their will unto God, but will follow their own proper will, leaving the penitence which God hath enjoyned, to exalt themſelves into States, Honours and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, ſeeking to live at our eaſe, inſtead of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to fulfil the Penitence due unto our ſins. We act directly contrary unto the Will of God, becauſe we cannot be ignorant that he requires that Submiſſion and Penitence of us. And with all that we ſay by word, that we are abandoned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, and look upon it as a thing impoſſible, that we ſhould refuſe him our will; which diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers always the more our blindneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ſaid unto her, That there was truely horrible dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs over the univerſal World; and that I my ſelf was environed with them, in believing that I would be abandoned unto God, while I had yet many cares for this life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid</hi>: Sir, you ſee well that your abandon is not true, ſo long as there are yet cares for this life. It were to have great diſtruſt of God, that after we
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:65025:145"/>
were abandoned unto his governing, we ſhould yet have Cares for temporal things. God, who hath created all things for man, can he refuſe him his neceſſities, when he were abandoned unto him? If he <note n="(u)" place="bottom">Math. 6. v. 26.</note> nouriſheth the Birds of Heaven, who labour not, ſhould he not nouriſh men in labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring? We are exceeding full of falſe perſwaſions, which flatter us to our ruin. For it is aſſured, that he who hath reſolved to abandon himſelf unto God, ſeeks no more earthly things, but thoſe which are eternal. God makes him ſee ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that what is here below are but tranſitory things, which the Servant of God should not touch but with the extremity of his foot, becauſe they are unworthy of a Soul dedicated unto God, which regards no more any thing but to pleaſe him. And if you, Sir, have other Cares, believe aſſuredly, that you are not yet abandoned unto him: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that <hi>abandon</hi> conſiſts in <hi>a ceſſation from every thing, to receive from God only</hi>; and the leſs ſelf acts, the more we receive. There needs no more but TO CEASE, AND TO RECEIVE. For all our Cares and Diſquiets, or activity for the things of this life, are all Impediments, which extinguish the operations which God would produce in our Soul. We muſt ceaſe and reſt, to let the Holy Spirit act alone. If our will be <hi>abandoned</hi> unto God, he will <note n="(w)" place="bottom">Pſ. 73, v. 23, 24.</note> rule it wiſely.</p>
               <p>Let us yield our ſouls unto his Government, and let us labour for accomplishing the penitence due unto our Sins, that we may have things neceſſary for the entertainment of our body: and then we may truely ſay, that we are abandoned unto God, not before: becauſe the States, Cares, and Affairs of the World, are all Impediments unto that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon</hi>:
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:65025:145"/>
yea, even ſo many divers means of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as men practiſe at preſent are all great Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments, ſince there is only that <hi>Abandon</hi> alone neceſſary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ſaid unto her, That that little word</hi> Abandon <hi>comprehended great things; that it was nevertheleſs the Philoſophers Stone to diſcover the eternal Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, unto which I aſpired.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, that word of ABANDON UN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TO GOD comprehendeth <note n="(x)" place="bottom">Pſ. 73. v. 25, 26.</note> all things: for he that is abandoned unto him, knows him and loves him, and knows alſo true Virtue to follow it, and the falſity of Vices to evite them: becauſe God <hi>abandons himſelf</hi> unto the Soul which is <hi>abandoned unto him,</hi> and the Holy Spirit lives in it; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining with it, replenisheth it with his Gifts to know every thing, and with his fruits to entertain it: ſo that all our happineſs depends on <hi>abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> our Will unto that of God; and not in many divers things, as men imagin. There needs no more but that <hi>abandon</hi> to be reunited in Grace and Favour with God, entirely converted unto him, and out of all ſorts of dangers. If you <note n="(y)" place="bottom">Luk. 15. v. 18.</note> be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>abandon</hi> your ſelf unto God, he shall preſently receive you, and convert you unto himſelf; and if <note n="(z)" place="bottom">Pſ. 18. v. 5, 7.</note> you be in fear of his Judgments, and of this dangerous time, <hi>abandon</hi> your ſelf unto him, he shall preſerve you, and ſave you. There is nothing to be done but that alone, <hi>to abandon your ſelf unto God, and remain under his dependance.</hi> Is not that a thing moſt reaſonable, that a Creature remain under the Dependance of its Creator? muſt there be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments and Conſtraints to oblige him unto a duty ſo juſt, ſo good, and ſo advantagious? There is no right, divine, human nor civil that can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:65025:146"/>
us from ſo juſt a thing. Notwithſtanding we rebel againſt all manner of rights to adhere unto our proper Will, which is ſo wicked and inſolent, which percipitates us into ſo many ſorts of evils; for all the Miſeries which we find in this life, proceed from our proper Will: and as the <hi>abandoning</hi> of it unto the Will of God, <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Pſ. 37. v. 5, 6, 7.</note> is the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all good; ſo the poſſeſſion of it is <note n="(b)" place="bottom">Iſ. 65. v. 3.</note> the conſummation of all manner of Evils; ſo that he who will be converted, needs nothing elſe but to remit his will into the power of God: In doing that he fulfilleth all the Law and the Prophets: becauſe they teach us nothing elſe but means to attain to that <hi>abandon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ſaid unto her, That being ſuppoſed, as it is moſt true, that in acknowledging always that we depend upon God in every thing, we need no other Precept nor Commandment; that it was a marvel that she had taught me ſo many means.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid</hi>: Sir, I have ſpoken to you of the ſtate of the World and of the Church, that you refer no more thereto by pious Beliefs. I have alſo told you, that we are arrived in the reign of Antichriſt, leſt you ſhould be deceived; and alſo that the world is judged, that you flatter not your ſelf by falſe hopes, believing that it ſhall yet endure, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in negligence.</p>
               <p>I have alſo ſhewed you true Virtue, that you be not deceived by that which is only apparent; having alſo declared unto you the ſins againſt the Holy Spirit, and them which we commit in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, that you might be ignorant of nothing that ſhould hinder your <hi>abandoning unto God</hi>: for the ignorance of Good and Evil would deſtroy us inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly; and as we are fallen in the time of univerſal Darkneſs, the common Enemy might very eaſily
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:65025:146"/>
deceive you, as he doth all the world, perſwading you that you are <hi>abandoned unto God,</hi> when you lived yet wholly unto your ſelf. For that have I explained ſo many things particularly to you, that you might make a good diſcretion of the Truth from Falſhood: and that you might aſſuredly <hi>aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> your ſelf unto God according to your deſires. And as you can never do Good <note n="(c)" place="bottom">Pſ. 34. v. 15.</note> without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from Evil, nor depart from it without knowing it; I have therefore laboured to diſcover unto you the good and the evil which reigns at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the world, to give you the aſſured marks to know if you are <hi>abandoned unto God</hi> in truth, or not; and as the Commandments of God are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us to diſcover unto us what hinders us to be <hi>abandoned</hi> unto him, and alſo the Evangelical Law, that by means thereof we might remove all the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments of our <hi>abandoning</hi> us unto God: Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Poverty being the means to diſengage our proper Will from deſiring periſhing Goods; Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity to diſengage the ſame Will from deſiring the Pleaſures of the Fleſh; and Obedience to diſengage our deſire from accompliſhing our proper Will; ſo all the other Evangelical Councels, which teach us to omit the things that hinder our <hi>abandoning</hi> our ſelves unto God: So I judged it neceſſary to declare unto you all the things which give let unto that <hi>abandon</hi> unto God, and alſo them that may ſerve us as means to facilitate unto us that <hi>abandon,</hi> which is the only thing eſſential <note n="(d)" place="bottom">Iſ. 58. v. 13.</note> which God requires of all them who will be ſaved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I asked Her, if it was ſufficient to reſolve abſolutely, that I will from henceforth abſolutely depend upon God, and no more uſe my own proper Will in any thing?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid</hi>: Sir, that Reſolution is a great begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:65025:147"/>
but it were to be feared, that we ſhould not effectually put it in practice through our evil ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits ſo long inveterated. Our proper will having always ruled, how can it be entirely ſubjected, unleſs by the means which Jeſus Chriſt hath deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us in his Goſpel, which are as ſo many degrees or ſteps to mount unto that <hi>abandon</hi>? for otherwiſe we might yet make falſe ſuppoſitions; as we have done heretofore until now. But when we put in practice the Evangelical doctrine, we ſhall thereby diſcover, how far we are advanced in that <hi>abandon unto God</hi>: for if our frailty had not needed theſe means, God had not taken human fleſh to come and teach us them: becauſe he can do nothing unprofitable. You muſt then ſtay upon that, Sir, and take up ſimply that Evangelical Doctrine, which ſhall teach us all things palpable unto our ſenſes; which following, we shall aſſuredly arrive at that <hi>abandon</hi>: for that is the true way, the moſt short, and moſt ſure way. Although God hath in divers times ſent Prophets and holy Perſons to tell men by what means they might recover that <hi>abandon</hi> unto God, yet have they never done it in ſuch perfection as Jeſus Chriſt when he was upon Earth: becauſe he hath omitted nothing, but hath taught all, ſo punctually, that men shall never need other inſtructions: becauſe that is the laſt Mercy which God will exerciſe toward men, who muſt expect nothing after the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt; and what hath been taught before or ſince, hath been nothing comparable unto that Evangelical Doctrine: we muſt embrace and follow it, if we will be ſaved, becauſe it teacheth us all the means of accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Law of God.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>I rendered her many thanks for the Goodneſs which she had to tell me ſo many things profitable unto my Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, promiſing to practiſe them as much as it were poſſible for me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>SHe ſaid</hi>: Sir, in the practiſe conſiſts your Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: for it is a very ſmall matter to know all the Conduct of the World, with all its Sciences and Secrets: if all that do not ſerve you as means to work out your Salvation, all <note n="(e)" place="bottom">Ecl. 12. v. 8, 9.12.</note> is vanity and deluſion: yea, Wiſdom shall be unto our greater Condemnation, when we do not put in practice the Good which we know, and do not flee and hate what we know of Evil. I had not enlarged to declare to you ſo many things of Good and Evil, if I had not remarked that you deſire to put them in practiſe: for to know the Eſſence of Virtue without practiſing it, is nothing elſe but vain Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations; and to know the Evil without eviting it, is a worſe curioſity, which fills our underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, without fruit.</p>
               <p>I have ſpoken of <hi>True Virtue,</hi> that you might fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it rather than the falſe; and alſo of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Church,</hi> that you might not follow it as holy.</p>
               <p>I have ſpoken unto you of <hi>the Reign of Antichriſt,</hi> that you be not deceived by its falſe appearances of
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:65025:148"/>
piety: declaring unto you <hi>that more then three fourth parts of the World are of his compact,</hi> that you might work out your Salvation with fear, and might not truſt your ſelf unto any perſon, becauſe the moſt Wicked are the greateſt Hypocrites, that they may the better deceive.</p>
               <p>I have told you, <hi>That we are in the judgment, and that the laſt Plagues are begun</hi>: that you might not refer your Salvation unto another time: becauſe that which remains unto us is ſhort.</p>
               <p>I have told you, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt shall come upon Earth to judge the Good and the Wicked, and shall there exterminate all Evils;</hi> that you might aſpire after that Felicity, and depart from the Miſery of them who ſhall be ſent to Hell.</p>
               <p>I have told you, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt shall remain upon Earth to reign there with all the Righteous eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally;</hi> that the expectation of that Glorious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing might give you ſtrength to ſuſtain with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience the Plagues and Tribulations which muſt ſhortly arrive, the like whereof have not yet been ſeen.</p>
               <p>I have told you, <hi>That the world shall endure eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, and that none of the Creatures shall periſh in their kinds:</hi> that the hope of your Felicity might not be founded upon imaginary Goods, and that we may in ſome manner comprehend what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment the Souls and Bodies of the Bleſſed ſhall have when all malignity ſhall be removed from every thing; that all the Elements and other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſhall then ſerve for Delights unto man, who shall rule over all, united unto Jeſus Chriſt in Body and Spirit; and that, that you might contemn the Pleaſures of this preſent Life by the hope of theſe to come.</p>
               <p>I have told you, <hi>that the</hi> Jews <hi>shall turn unto God,</hi>
                  <pb n="237" facs="tcp:65025:148"/>
                  <hi>and be his People; and that the</hi> Catholiques <hi>ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected and abandoned:</hi> that you might never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe any perſon; for the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> people, the moſt contemned of all Nations, ſhall be the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted; and <note n="(f)" place="bottom">Matth, 3. v. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>of Stones ſhall be made Children of Abraham</hi>; and that you might willingly leave the Maxims of the <hi>Romiſh Church,</hi> which ſhall for its Evil-doings be quickly extermined.</p>
               <p>I have told you, <hi>That Man is created for no other end, but to take his delights with God;</hi> that you may no more ſeek any thing upon Earth, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn every thing, to enjoy that Entertainment with God; having alſo told you, <hi>that this preſent Life is only a time of Penitence;</hi> that all your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours be performed in that Spirit of Penitence, unto which God hath ſubjected all men for their Sins.</p>
               <p>Finally, Sir, I have told you, <hi>That all the Laws, the Prophets, and all Virtues conſiſt in the abandon of our Will unto that of God:</hi> that you be not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by ſo many other divers things; but might paſs your Life joyfully under that Dependance of God, which is the leaſt thing we could render un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God for ſo many Benefits which we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of him, which he permits us to enjoy, provided we depend upon him in all things: ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving alſo ſhewed you, <hi>That ſo many divers means which the Prieſts, Monks, and Religious teach us as means to procure our Salvation, are things that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw us therefrom, by which we are ſeduced and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived:</hi> becauſe they make us refer more to men than unto God: which is an Idolatry that hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected all <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> in which none ſtudy to <hi>aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> their will unto the will of God; but every one enjoys and diſpoſes of it at his own pleaſure, as if
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:65025:149"/>
every one were ſoveraign of himſelf. One will be Great, and another Rich; one will rule over others, and be followed and ſerved; one goes in a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot, another upon Horſeback; finally, every one will follow his ſolace and pleaſures after his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per inclinations, believing with all that to work out their ſalvation, becauſe the Prieſts and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious promiſe it to them. Theſe are new Gods and new Saviours, who have changed unto us the Order eſtabliſhed by God, our Father and Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and the Practice which his Son Jeſus came to teach us. They conduct us by the way of Hell, perſwading us, that it is that of Paradiſe: with theſe perſwaſions every one ſuffers himſelf to be deceived and ſeduced, there being no perſon in <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> that believes that he cannot be ſaved without abandoning his will unto that of God: which is nevertheleſs an eternal Truth, which ſhall never change, whatever man do: if he do not acknowledge the Dependance which he hath upon God in every thing, he ſhall never be ſaved; and if he do not aſſume the Evangelical Councels as the true means taught by God for returning into that dependance, he ſhall never be ſave: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God teacheth nothing unprofitable, but only things expreſsly neceſſary, unto which all the world muſt yield: which no perſon doth, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving men more than God: though the moſt part be ruled by the Devil, who gains unto himſelf the moſt part of men by means of theſe ſavage Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, who abandon the Sheep in the power of the infernal Wolf, to make them periſh with themſelves eternally, in retiring them from God to attract them to themſelves.</p>
               <p>I have alſo told you, <hi>That there are no more any true Chriſtians upon Earth:</hi> that you might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:65025:149"/>
one, and ſhould not ſuppoſe blindly to be ſuch: becauſe there can be no <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> but they who follow the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt: all others are deceived in believing it: for God doth not change for the changing of men: we are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent as much obliged to depend upon God as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> the firſt man was; and as much obliged to labour the Earth as he, although we had done no other ſin than that which he committed in us: we muſt alſo now follow the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, as did the firſt <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> becauſe that Doctrine is immutable, and shall never change: ſo he that doth not follow it, is not a true <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and cannot be ſaved without becoming ſuch. No per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon muſt flatter himſelf in that point. We muſt imitate Jeſus Chriſt, or <note n="(g)" place="bottom">Joh. 15. v. 6.</note> perish eternally: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are all fallen into that ſin of Ingratitude, that we will not depend upon God, as well by the will of <hi>Adam,</hi> as of our own proper will: and ſo we have need to aſſume that Evangelical Law, that we might return into that Dependance upon God, which is ſo juſt and reaſonable.</p>
               <p>Although God had never demanded it of man, he ought by divine and human Right to render unto God that ſubmiſſion of his free will; and he would aſſuredly do it if he were not diverted by men like himſelf: becauſe even natural reaſon obligeth him to depend upon him; from whom he receiveth every thing; which human wiſdom hath diverted, having found ſo many Studies and Arguments to favour our proper will, that all men believe it to be lawful to follow it without offending him, who pleaſed to reſerve it for himſelf. Sir, <note n="(h)" place="bottom">Math. 15. v. 24.</note> theſe are all blind, who lead the blind, and all fall into the ditch. Be you never of that band; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:65025:150"/>
in the Light which God sheweth you. I have ſpoken TRUTH unto you, not affecting to be believed or followed; but only to tend and aim at your Salvation. All that I have told you is neceſſary for you, if you will uſe it well: becauſe we cannot love God without knowing him, nor follow Virtue without comprehending it: we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not alſo evite the Deceit without diſcovering it, nor eſcape the Paws of the Devil without turning away therefrom: make good uſe of all theſe things, and you shall be happy in this world and in the other. I doubt not but my manner of ſpeech may have given you pain and difficulty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they do not accord with your Philoſophy, Theology, or other Scholaſtique Sciences. But believe that I have never made profeſſion of any human Sciences: I love rather to be ignorant of than to know them; and if I could learn in a quarter of an hour all the Sciences of the Schools, I would not employ ſo little time thereto: becauſe I know that human Sciences are great Impediments unto the Holy Spirit; and alſo that the time is come, <note n="(i)" place="bottom">Iſ. 29. v. 14.</note> when God shall deſtroy the Wiſdom of the Wiſe, and bring to nothing the Prudence of the Prudent: and ſo I cannot uſe fine Diſcourſes, but ſuch only as make known the native Truth: the words, the terms, may well be debated and controlled: but never the true ſenſe, which is true. I will not diſpute with the Wiſe, ſeeing God shall shortly overcome them by the effects of my words; nor alſo polish my Language, becauſe the ſimple nativeneſs pleaſeth God more than the rhetorical Eloquences, ſubject unto vanity: for he that ſpeaks that he may ſpeak elegantly, is filled with vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory, willing to renounce which, I ſeek only
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:65025:150"/>
ſimple words, that may expreſs my conceptions.</p>
               <p>I believe, Sir, that you have ſufficiently under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood me; and that I can ſay no more to you to co-operate unto your Salvation; there remains no more but to put it in practice. Which you ſhall do more eaſily in ſolitude, or the deſert, than elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, becauſe of the corruption of men which are great letts unto us, and alſo the power which the Devil hath at preſent over their ſpirits, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch them that are yet ſound and entire. Flee then, Sir, that you may evite all theſe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, leſt you might be diverted from your good propoſal, and ſhould look back <note n="(k)" place="bottom">Gen 19. v. 26.</note> as <hi>Lot's</hi> Wife, who was changed into a Statue of Salt. Yet a little Penitence, and after God will deliver you to enter into the joy which ſhall never end. That is it I wiſh unto you, in giving you Adiew.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I was grieved to hear that ſhe would leave me, praying her not to withdraw, ſeeing I would follow what ſhe had taught me, which was nothing elſe but Self-denial, and Dependance upon God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid unto me:</hi> Sir, it ſhall be more pure that you remain alone: for I am only a Creature as you are, and we muſt cleave unto the Creator alone, without interruption: <note n="(l)" place="bottom">Iſ. 58. v. 13, 14.</note> he ſhall conduct you at his pleaſure, provided you be <hi>abandoned</hi> unto his will; you need no more inſtructions of any perſon. I have told you more than ſufficient to conduct you unto union with God. It ſhould be hereafter only repetitions of things foreſaid, which ſhould bereave your time and mine, which it is better to employ in the practice than in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions. Leave me in my liberty, and take you alſo yours: God hath not created us together. He ſhall ſave us, though ſeparated in body. True
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:65025:151"/>
Union conſiſts in a conformity of will with God, and not in particular Conferences. I muſt confeſs, I have often diſtracted my ſelf from entertainments with God to ſpeak to you of ſo many divers things: but I judged them neceſſary for your Salvation: therefore have they not been grievous unto me: but now, when you know the truth of many things, it is not neceſſary to ſpeak more unto you. God ſhall always teach you enough, provided you continue faithful unto him. He hath never refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed what men ask for their Salvation. You muſt have no more any other pretenſions. Let the <note n="(m)" place="bottom">Pſ. 46. v. 3. &amp;c.</note> World be overturned; Let the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh; Let the Elements be moved againſt ſinners; all that cannot touch you, provided you keep you firmly united with God. Leave willingly every thing to find that union. If I be with you or not, it is a ſmall matter, provided you be with God, that ſhould ſuffice; becauſe he alone can ſave you, and none elſe. There is always mixture when a Creature cleaves to its like. I have often deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them who hold themſelves addicted to perſons, although it were under ſome pious pretext. I will not do my ſelf what I deſpiſe in others.</p>

                  <hi>I ſaid unto her, That ſhe had promiſed to explain to me the</hi> 24. <hi>Chapter of St. Matthew, that ſhe ſhould at leaſt give me it before ſhe left me.</hi>

we live at preſent. Theſe are not Fables made at pleaſure; but Truths proceeded out of the mouth of Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, which every one ought well to apprehend, and follow the councels which he gives. They are moſt ſalutary and moſt proper <note n="(n)" place="bottom">Luk 21. v. 36.</note> for eſcaping the evils to come, which hang over our heads. I muſt give it in writing for an eternal remembrance, that men may obſerve if all that it contains ſhall not be effected in our time. Do not oppoſe what you ſhall find con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to your ſtudies, or old impreſſions, becauſe the Holy Spirit ſhall give perfect and unheard of intelligences of the Holy Scriptures; becauſe we are arrived in the fulneſs of time. If you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them with Humility of Heart, you ſhall underſtand all things in perfection: but you muſt become <hi>a Child,</hi> and ceaſe from being a Wiſe Man; becauſe <note n="(o)" place="bottom">Pſ. 25 v. 14.

               <p>
                  <hi>I brought unto her the text of the goſpel, with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to ſubmit my underſtanding unto the Light of the Holy Spirit entirely to my power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, that Submiſſion is the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion requiſit: For if you would act the Doctor or wiſe learned man, you ſhould put oppoſition un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Light of the Holy Spirit, ſource of all Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.

You muſt always believe and maintain that he is more wiſe than all the Doctors that ever were in the world, and that we learn more by a little ray of his Light, than by an hundred years of moſt aſſiduous ſtudy. Therefore <note n="(p)" place="bottom">1 Cor. 8. v. 12.</note> render all your Wiſdom Ignorances, and <note n="(q)" place="bottom">Math. 18. v. 3. 1 Pet. 2. v. 2.</note> become as an Infant newly born again, that you may receive theſe new Intelligences, which ſhall give you more light than ever all the Old Fathers together have had: becauſe they have never diſcovered the <note n="(r)" place="bottom">Math. 13. v. 44.</note> hidden Treaſures; becauſe the time was not yet come. Every one ſpoke according to his thoughts, and not as it was really, becauſe it was <note n="(ſ)" place="bottom">Rev. 5. v, 1 — 9.</note> a cloſed Book, which none was worthy to open but Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, ſince he was killed and put to death. There is not hitherto any thing accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed of all the Holy Scriptures but that death, which ſhall diſcloſe the marvellous things of God, which have remained hidden until now, and begin to be revealed unto them who ſhall be humble of heart: but the wiſe <note n="(t)" place="bottom">Iſ. 29. v. 14.</note> ſhall periſh with their wiſdom.

               <p>
                  <hi>I aſked her, How it were poſſible to leave all Sciences humanly acquired, to become a Child, when one is an Aged Man?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>SHe ſaid</hi>: Sir, except you do it, you ſhall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. It is Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt <note n="(y)" place="bottom">Math. 18, v, 3,</note> who ſaith it: and he cannot lie; but he urgeth that neceſſity of becoming Children by Threatenings of not entering into the Kingdom of heaven: which were the greateſt evil that can befal man. It were better never to be born, than not to be ſaved: and ſeeing we cannot be ſaved without becoming Children, we muſt do it at any rate. Would you, Sir, eſteem more the Honour of the World, or your acquired Science, than the Kingdom of heaven? That were very lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſeeing all the things of this world do but paſs as the Bird which cutteth the Air, and leaveth no trace of its way after it; ſo we, when we ſhall be paſſed through this world, there ſhall remain nothing of our Sciences or Studies, nor of our Honour and Reputation: all endeth with us; and if there remain in the ſpirit of others any reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:65025:153"/>
that we were wiſe and learned, that is inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible unto us after death. If we have pleaſed our ſelves therein in our life, the ſufferings of theſe complacencies attend us in the other world: and inſtead that it ſhould be a happineſs to us that we have been wiſe, it is a great miſery to us to have loſt the Kingdom of Heaven by the ſame wiſdom. Forſake all theſe human Conſiderations, Sir, and become a Child though you be aged. You muſt make the more haſte, leſt time and life eſcape: Never conſult <note n="(z)" place="bottom">Gal. 1. v. 16.</note> fleſh and blood, for they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and corrupt us. <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Eccl. 37. v. 17, 18.</note> Let us conſult only our divine Soul, which is reaſonable; and it ſhall tell you, that nothing is better nor more reaſonable than to <hi>abandon</hi> our free will unto God, who hath given us it, and to ſubmit it unto his government as a little Child: that on that depends our eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Happineſs; and that nothing elſe can ſave us: becauſe without that Dependance, there is no Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ſaid unto her, That I knew moſt clearly that truth, that there was no Salvation without the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance of God: asking, how I could now ignore Sciences formerly acquired, ſeeing I could not make my ſelf not to have them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, nothing can hurt you if all be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto God. You cannot ignore what you know by means of your Studies: but you can well ſubmit all theſe Sciences unto God, and account them as Ignorances; as in effect they are. Apply no more your ſpirit unto the ſtudy of Sciences, and believe them to be all vain in reſpect of the Wiſdom of God. You ſhall know that you are abandoned unto his will, when <note n="(b)" place="bottom">Pſ. 73. v. 25, 26,</note> you ſeek no more any thing upon Earth, neither Learning nor
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:65025:153"/>
Wiſdom, nor deſire to know any thing elſe but what may render you acceptable unto God: For he that is abandoned unto him without Deceit, moves himſelf no more but for what regards his Glory, all the reſt toucheth him no more. If he is wiſe, or ignorant, it is indifferent unto him. Wiſdom ſerves him for what regards the Glory of God, and in no wiſe to rule upon Earth; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well that he who is abandoned unto God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Sciences, is as great as he who is ſo with much Learning: and even as we may well be Poor of Spirit in poſſeſſing Riches; ſo can we poſſeſs much learning, and withal be ſimple of Spirit: when we have ſubmitted all our Learning unto God, he ſerves himſelf of it as he pleaſeth: but ſo long as we will rely on and make account of them, we are not yet become Children, to have entry into the Kingdom of Heaven. And ſeeing God ſheweth you, Sir, that there is no Salvation without dependance on him, put your ſelf prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly therein, without conſidering if you have Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or any thing elſe: For (as the Proverb is) <hi>God makes Mercury of all wood:</hi> we muſt not regard our ſelves, but his will, who deſires that all men, of whatever conditions, hold themſelves under his Dependance, remitting their free wills into his power, without uſing the ſame themſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ſaid unto her, That abſolutely and irrevocably I abandoned my ſelf unto God to be a true Child; but that I had yet ſome repugnancy to renounce the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Ha, Sir, you muſt never renounce the Holy Church: but rather die: but you muſt only renounce the abomination which is crept in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church of theſe days. Do you not ſee that ſhe hath falſified her faith unto her law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:65025:154"/>
Husband Jeſus Chriſt: and hath not remained faithful unto him? I ſhould be glad that you could ſhew me one only point of the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt that ſhe obſerves, or one only thing that ſhe practiſeth, that is not contrary to the Life and Doctrine of her lawful Husband, who deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from heaven unto the Earth to teach her them, as well by his Works, as by his Words: all which things are deſpiſed by her who ſhould be his law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Spouſe. I have often ſpoken to you of her Exceſſes, and Adulteries: will you yet hold her for the Holy Church, while the Devil <note n="(c)" place="bottom">2 Theſ. 2. v. 4,</note> hath placed his throne in her? what weakneſs of ſpirit, to feel repugnancy to forſake ſo evil a thing upon frivolous perſwaſions that it is holy! while God hath given us an underſtanding and reaſon; it is for no other end but that we may diſcern evil from good, that we may not periſh blindly: and now you would change Gods deſigns, in ſtifling your underſtanding and reaſon, to follow evil blindly: and ſeeing it ſo openly evil, you form ſome fooliſh imagination, that it is yet good; That muſt come only from a meer bewitching of ſpirit: becauſe reaſon, even natural, diſcovers ſufficiently unto us, that the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church at preſent is not the Spouſe of Jeſus Chriſt: becauſe ſhe doth not in any thing follow her husband; and that two things ſo alienated cannot make confederacy. How can you have repugnance to leave her who hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken her God? If Beaſts, and inſenſible Creatures, and all the Elements, have ariſen againſt man when he did forſake the Dependance of his God; how ſhould man, ſo reaſonable, not ariſe againſt that Church, which hath forſaken the Dependance of her God, to will no more dependance but upon
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:65025:154"/>
her ſelf? we ſhould rather have repugnancy to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main under her, than to forſake her: or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we have leſs reſentments of the offence done unto our Creator, than the Beaſts and elements, or inanimate things, which have always reſented the injury done unto their Creator; yea, at the death of Jeſus Chriſt <note n="(d)" place="bottom">Math. 27. v. 51.</note> the <hi>Stones did rent,</hi> and the <hi>Sun was darkened.</hi> Have you leſs affection for God, Sir, then theſe ſtones, in not reſenting the continual injuries which that Church doth unto God? If a beautiful Angel is become a Devil for having deſired in his heart to be equal unto God, what ſhall become of her which preferreth her ſelf unto the ſame God without willing to him in any thing? I regret yet your blindneſs in that point, Sir; and cannot believe that your repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy cometh from your reaſon, but ſome habitual ſenſibility which you have unto the Church: For if your Underſtanding did apply it ſelf to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the origin of that repugnancy, it ſhould ſee clearly that it cometh from the pious affection which you have for the Church; but that you do not take it where it is: becauſe men are deluded in that, as in other things, by terms and words of men: and when they hear <hi>Rome</hi> named <hi>the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Church,</hi> that word engenders in us affection for her, without penetrating if ſhe be that of which they ſpeak: when we would deceive a Child, and keep him in fear of his Father, we put his Cloak and Hat upon a Fagot in ſome place, ſomewhat obſcure, which the Child perceiving, he believeth that it is truely he, and feareth and reſpecteth him. But if he drew near, and lift up the Cloak, he ſhould ſee that he was deceived, and that what he held for his Father, is only ſome Wood.
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:65025:155"/>
Verily, Sir, in the Darkneſs wherein we live at preſent, they do the very ſame with us, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>Rome</hi> with the Cloak of the Holy Church, and cloathing it with the Head of Jeſus Chriſt; we fear and reſpect it, as if it were our true Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Holy Church, authoriſed by Jeſus Chriſt, and his lawful Spouſe: but when we draw near, and lift up that Cloak, we ſhall ſee that there is nothing but Wood, inſtead of Sanctity, which cannot be profitable unto us, except to warm us in the Winter. Verily, Sir, we muſt not be ſo much Children in what regards our eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. We muſt not walk blindly in a matter ſo important. If men apply all their ſpirit to make a Hoſe, or a Shoe, why ſhould they not apply it more to ſave their Soul? It is good to have the <note n="(e)" place="bottom">Math. 10. v. 16.</note> ſimplicity of the Dove in regard of God: for he that hath abandoned himſelf unto him, hath no more but to ſuffer himſelf to be conducted as a little Child: but we muſt have the Prudence of the Serpent to beware of men, who can deceive or be deceived: and when they ſay to us, <hi>behold the Holy Church</hi>! we muſt obſerve narrowly, if it is truely her, or if it is a Fagot covered with her Mantle. It is for that only that God hath given us an underſtanding, that we may <note n="(f)" place="bottom">1 Cor 20. v. 15.</note> always diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern true good from falſe, eſpecially in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our Salvation: becauſe all other things are vain and periſhing, unworthy of a ſerious appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of ſpirit; ſeeing it ought not to be applyed but unto things eternal, for which we are created: and our miſery proceeds from that we make more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſearches to diſcover the turns and courſes of the affairs of the world, than thoſe of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. In which the Scripture hath reaſon to ſay,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:65025:155" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that <note n="(g)" place="bottom">Luk. 16. v. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>the Children of this world are more prudent than the Children of the Kingdom:</hi> becauſe before engaging in any State, Office, or Traffique, they will always ponder if it be truely advantagious and profitable: and they will be loath to rely upon the Words of men, and believe blindly that a thing is good before they have firſt experienced it. If they have ſo much providence for what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards the Earth, how much ſhould we have for what regards Heaven? we found our Salvation blindly upon what they tell us, that <hi>Rome is our Mother the Holy Church,</hi> and we do not ſound that affair which concerns us ſo much, to know if true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhe hath the quality of our true Mother, and if ſhe is confederated with our true Father, who is immutable in all his qualities, unto which that Spouſe muſt always be conform. We muſt ſee if ſhe whom they call our Mother, hath the Spirit and Practice of our Father; and if we find nothing like it, we muſt renounce her, and account her deceitful and lying, unworthy of our affection.</p>
