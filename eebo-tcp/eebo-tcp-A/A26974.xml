            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O prevent your trouble and miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in the peruſal of theſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations: I have two things here at the entrance to acquaint you with. Firſt, The occaſion of all theſe Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings: Secondly, The true ſtate of the Controverſies here managed. The firſt Diſputation is upon a Queſtion of conſiderable weight, whether Chriſt as Chriſt, and ſo as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, Prieſt and King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be the Object of that Faith by which we are juſtified? Three points eſpecially my Reverend Brother Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> was pleaſed to publiſh his Reaſons againſt, which in my <hi>Aphoriſms</hi> I had aſſerted. Theſe being vindicated by me in an Apologie, he renewed the conflict in his Treatiſe of the Sacraments. The firſt
<pb facs="tcp:60968:3"/>
about the Sacraments I have defended again in a Volume by it ſelf. The ſecond is this in hand, which I had finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about fifteen or ſixteen months ago. The third is about the Inſtrumental efficiency of Faith to our Juſtification, of which I had alſo begun above a twelve month ſince. But it hath lately pleaſed our wiſe and gracious Lord to call this Reverend Brother to himſelf: whereupon, though this firſt Diſputation was gone ſo far, that I could not well recall it, yet the others, which was not out of my power, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to condemn to perpetual ſilence. If you ask me a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this reſolution, I muſt deſire that my diſpoſition and paſsion may go for part of a Reaſon this once. The grief of my heart for the loſs of this precious ſervant of Chriſt would not permit me to appear any further in a way that ſeemed to militate with the dead, and with one whoſe death, we have all ſo much cauſe to lament. Alas, that our ſin ſhould provoke our dear Father, to put out the precious Lights of his Sanctuary, and to call in ſuch experienced faithful Labourers, while ignorance, and error, and prophaneſs, and all Vice doth ſo plenteouſly ſurvive. When theſe plants of Hell do thrive upon us, under all our care to weed them up: what will they do when the Vineyard is left deſolate? Though God in mercy is raiſing up a ſupply of young ones, that may come to be Pillars in their dayes: yet alas, what difference will the Church find between theſe, and their grave experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Guides: and how many years ſtudy, and experience, and patience, is neceſſary to ripen theſe tender plants, to bring them to the ſtature, and ſtability, and ſtrength of ſuch as this Bleſſed ſervant of Chriſt, that is now taken from us. The ſenſe of our loſs doth make it doubly bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to my thoughts, that ever I was unhappily engaged in any way of ſerving the Lord of Truth, which muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein
<pb facs="tcp:60968:3"/>
ſo much contradiction of ſuch a friend of Truth. As it is for God, or for Truth, or for the uſe of the Church, I dare not diſown it; but as it ſavoureth of diſagreement (though neceſsitated to it) it is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful to me to think of, or review. But our diſeaſes will have their pains. We muſt bear the ſmites of our own and our Brethrens weakneſſes, rather then neglect the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Chriſt, his Church and Truth. We quickly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don one another, and at the furtheſt Heaven agreeth us all: But the benefit of our ſearch, though mixed with our infirmities, may be ſomewhat ſerviceable when we are gone.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Diſputation is yet more ungrateful to me, then the firſt: the Reverend Brother whom I contradict being as high and dear in my eſteem as moſt men alive; indeed being an Honour and Bleſsing to the Church in this unworthy Generation. The Lord preſerve him long for his ſervice. But my Defence here alſo is neceſsitated. 1. I did my beſt to have prevented the Neceſsity, and could not: I mean, not by diſwading him from oppoſing me in Print, for that might have hindered the Church of the Benefit of his Oppoſition (for ought I knew, till I had ſeen it:) But by trying firſt, whether I could receive or give ſatisfaction. 2. I had publickly obliged my ſelf, if this Reverend Brother did Diſſent, to ſearch again: and by an Epiſtle, became more accountable to the world for Diſſenting from him then other men. 3. His Name deſervedly precious in the Church, hath the greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to over-lay the Truth, where humane imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on engageth him againſt it. Yet do I not blame him for beginning this Conteſt with me; but take the blame to my ſelf that might occaſion it, by diſhonouring his Name by a temeracious prefixing it to my undigeſted papers,
<pb facs="tcp:60968:4"/>
(though nothing but High eſtimation, and Affection was my Motive.)</p>
            <p>The Letters that paſt between us were never intended for the view of the world: And therefore I muſt deſire the Reader to remember it, if ſometime I be more preſsing and vehement, then manners and reverence require; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we uſe to ſpeak freelier in private among friends, then in the hearing of the world. And yet I thought it my duty now to joyn them with the reſt for theſe Reaſons. 1. Becauſe ſome paſſages in the Writings of this Reverend Brother, do in a manner invite me to it. 2. Becauſe the matter requireth me to ſpeak the ſame things; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is as good affix the old, as be at the ſame labour needleſly again. 3. And it can be no wrong to him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is my own Papers that are the main bulk of what I publiſh: His Letters being brief, and annexed but as the occaſions of mine. 4. But eſpecially, I was brought to think it meet, by the open blame that I have received from ſome very dear and Reverend Brethren, for not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting this publike Conteſt. And therefore I thought good to let them ſee, that I was not wholly wanting to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it.</p>
            <p>If there be any paſſages in theſe Writings too eager or provoking (which I muſt needs ſuſpect even where I have not obſerved them, as being conſcious of too keen a ſtile, forgetting the perſons while I ſpeak meerly to the words and matter,) I do intreat my Brethren to pardon it, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not deſigned to their provocation or diſhonour, and as I heartily do the like by theirs, and as I hope God will do both theirs and mine. And I do adjure the Reader to be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lieve that this Controverſie: for all our infirmities is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged with a very high eſteem and honour of thoſe Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Brethren, whom I am neceſsitated to gainſay. Nor
<pb facs="tcp:60968:4"/>
would I have it be any diſhonour to them (though an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe to me,) that they have been the Aſſailants, and begun the conflict: for the Truths of God muſt be precious to us all, and I doubt not but they were confident that it was ſome dangerous errour, which they ſet upon, and I have here proved to be the Truth. Nor is it any ſuch wrong to either ſide, to be openly contradicted, that Reaſons may be openly produced, and men may have ſome further help, to ſee into theſe Points. Let the proud ſwell or ſmart, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are thus proclaimed fallible, and miſtaken; but the Humble that are devoted ſervants to the Truth, are of another ſpirit, and have learnt another leſſon.</p>
            <p>And if any Papiſt or enemy to our unity and Peace, ſhall from theſe Writings predicate our diſſentions or diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, let them know to their faces, that even theſe differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as momentous as they ſeem, are not neer ſo great as are commonly publiſhed among themſelves: nor are they for Number one to twenty, perhaps to a hundred, that are agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated in their Schooles, and the writings of their Doctors: Had we ſuch differences as thoſe of the <hi>Jeſuit Caſuiſts</hi> opened by <hi>Montaltas</hi> the <hi>Janſenian</hi> in his Myſterie of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitiſm,</hi> out of their own writings, ſomething they might then ſay againſt us. Yea I doubt not but we differ with more hearty Chriſtian Love, then they agree; and have more real union in our controverſies, then they have in their Articles of Faith, and are neerer one another in our ſmaller differences, then the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Italians</hi> are in their very Fundamentals.</p>
            <p>The third Diſputation was called forth by Mr. <hi>Warner</hi>'s Treatiſe of the <hi>Object and Office of Faith,</hi> and takes up the ſubject of the firſt Diſputation, with ſome others.</p>
            <p>When that was in the Preſs, Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi>'s Book againſt <hi>Infant Baptiſm</hi> came forth, in which I found the Pap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb facs="tcp:60968:5"/>
that I ſent to him (upon his importunity) printed without my conſent, (which if God will, I ſhall yet vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate.) And therefore ſeeing that it is his way, I thought he might do the like by other Papers, which formerly I had wrote to him on this ſubject of Juſtification. And therefore thinking it fitter that I ſhould publiſh them (of the two) then he, (I have ſaved him the charge of printing them, and annexed them to theſe.</p>
            <p>The fourth Diſputation was added, becauſe it is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heart of our Controverſie, which moſt of our Diſputes about the inſtrumentall Cauſality of Faith as to Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and the other Concomitant, are reſolved into.</p>
            <p>That the Reader may underſtand theſe Diſputations the better, I ſhall here at the entrance ſhew him the face of the way that I maintain, and alſo of the way that I op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>The way that I plead for is contained in theſe Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <hi>1.</hi> Man having broken the Law of Nature or works, is loſt, and diſabled to his own Recovery, or to do any works by which that Law will ever juſtifie him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Jeſus Chriſt hath Redeemed him from this loſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, by his Incarnation, Life, Death, Reſurrection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> fulfilling the Law by his obedience, and ſuffering for our not fulfilling it, and thereby ſatisfying the Lawgiver, and attaining the ends of the Law, and more: making him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf an example to us of holineſs, and becoming our Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, High Prieſt and King, to ſave us from all ſin and enemies, and recover us to God, for our Salvation, and his Glory and Pleaſure.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Offices and Works of Chriſt, are for other ends as well as for our juſtification; even for our Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Glorification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The Believer ought not to confound the offices, works,
<pb facs="tcp:60968:5"/>
or ends and effects, but to apprehend them as diſtinctly as he can.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The ſame Offices of Chriſt are exerciſed in the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting ſeveral works: He doth juſtifie us both as Prieſt, Prophet and King: and he ſanctifieth us as Prieſt, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet and King, His Death purchaſing both our juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſanctification; and his Teaching ſhewing us the way to both, and his Kingly Office conferring both, though moſt notably our juſtification; and the Prophetical effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more of our ſanctification, then of our juſtification.</p>
            <p n="6">6, We muſt have part in Chriſt himſelf as our Head, in order of Nature before we can partake of juſtification, Sanctification, (as following our firſt faith) or Glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation from him.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Though our Phyſical Communion with Chriſt is ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by a Phyſical change on the ſoul; yet our Right to him and to Juſtification, and other following benefits is the effect of a free Gift, or Teſtament, or Promiſe, and that Promiſe or free Gift is our Title, which is <hi>Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum juris,</hi> or the efficient Inſtrumental cauſe.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Chriſt and pardon, or juſtification, and Right to Heaven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are given us by one and the ſame Deed of Gift: ſo that he that hath Right to Chriſt, hath by the ſame Title &amp; on the ſame terms Right to theſe his benefits.</p>
            <p n="9">9. This Promiſe or Gift is conditional; though it be but the Condition of a free Gift that is required.</p>
            <p n="10">10. No mans works, Repentance or Faith is his proper Title to pardon or life, nor any proper meritorious cauſe of it; nor any efficient. Principal or Inſtrumental cauſes of his Right; No act of ours can be more then a meer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of that Right; and a <hi>Cauſa ſine quâ non</hi> (which, as it is an act that's pleaſing to God, and hath the Promiſe of a Reward, the Fathers called improperly by the Name
<pb facs="tcp:60968:6"/>
of Merit, which yet leſs fitly agrees to the Condition of our firſt Juſtification then of our Glorification.)</p>
            <p n="11">11. Chriſts pardon and life are given by this Goſpel-Promiſe on condition of our faith in Chriſt, that is, if we become Believers in Chriſt; or Chriſtians; which is, If we accept of Chriſt as offered in the Goſpel, and that is, to bring us from our ſins and ſelves to God, by the acts of his Teaching, Prieſtly, and Kingly Office; Or, if we believe in Chriſt as Chriſt. So that it is not any one ſingle act of Faith that is the condition of Juſtification: nor are the ſeveral Benefits of Chriſt given us on condition of ſeveral acts of Faith; as if we had Right to pardon by one act, and to Chriſt himſelf by another, and to Adoption by another; and to Heaven by another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nor have the ſeveral acts of our faith as divided an Intereſt in procurement of the Benefits as Chriſts actions had: But it is one and the ſame entire faith in Chriſt as Chriſt, that is the condition of all theſe conſequent ſpecial Benefits; without diviſion in the procurement. So that the Belief in Chriſt as our Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher and King hath as much hand in our Juſtification, as believing in him as Prieſt; it being the backwardneſs of nature to the acceptance of Chriſts Government and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that is a ſpecial Reaſon why faith is made the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of that pardon, which Nature is not ſo backward to accept.</p>
            <p n="12">12. The Reaſons to be aſsigned, why faith in Chriſt is made the condition of Juſtification, is, <hi>1.</hi> The will of the free Donor. <hi>2.</hi> The fitneſs of faith to that Office; as being ſuited to Gods Ends, and to Chriſt the Object, and to mans neceſsitous eſtate. Not only becauſe it is the Receiving of Righteouſneſs, but for all theſe Reaſons to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, in which its aptitude doth conſiſt; and its Apti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to the Honour of the Redeemer and free Juſtifier is
<pb facs="tcp:60968:6"/>
the principal part of its Aptitude: it being impoſsible that God ſhould prefer man as his ultimate and before himſelf.</p>
            <p n="13">13. Though the Reaſon why Faith is made by God the condition of our Juſtification, muſt partly be fetcht from the Nature of Faith, which ſome call its Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentallity in apprehending Chriſt, yet the Reaſon why we are <hi>Juſtified</hi> by Faith, muſt be fetched from the Tenour of the Promiſe and Will of the Promiſer. So that though the Remote Reaſon be that Aptitude of Faith, which is the <hi>Diſpoſitio material;</hi> yet the formal neereſt Reaſon is, becauſe God hath made it the condition of the Gift, which ſhall ſuſpend the efficacy till performed, and when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, the benefit ſhall be ours.</p>
            <p n="14">14. As Faith hath its denomination from ſome one or few acts, which yet ſuppoſe many as concomitant and conſequent: So thoſe concomitant and conſequent Acts have their anſwerable place and Intereſt in the foreſaid Conditionality, as to our part in Chriſt and Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="15">15. And therefore it was not the Apoſtles meaning to ſet Faith againſt theſe concomitant acts, (as Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, hope in Chriſt, deſire of Chriſt, love to Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) and to exclude theſe under the notion of Works: but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily to ſuppoſe them in their order.</p>
            <p n="16">16. The burdenſome works of the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be ſuch as from the dignity and perfection of that Law, would juſtifie men by procuring pardon of ſin, and acceptance with God, are they that the <hi>Jews</hi> oppoſed to Chriſts Righteouſneſs and Juſtification by Faith, and which <hi>Paul</hi> diſputeth againſt, and conſequently againſt any works, or acts, or habits of our own, oppoſed to Chriſt, or this way of free juſtification by him.</p>
            <p n="17">
               <pb facs="tcp:60968:7"/>17. The not looſing our Iuſtification and Title to Chriſt and Life, hath more for its condition, then the firſt Reception or Poſſeſsion hath. And ſo hath the final Iuſtification at judgement, if men live after their firſt believing.</p>
            <p n="18">18. Juſtification at judgement, being the Adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to Glory, hath the ſame conditions as Glorification it ſelf hath.</p>
            <p>Reader, <hi>In theſe Eighteen Propoſitions, thou mayſt fully ſee the Doctrine that I contend for, which alſo in my Confeſſion, Apologie, and this Book I have expreſſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And now I will ſhew you ſomewhat of the face of the Doctrine, which the Diſſenters commonly do propugne, but not ſo largely, becauſe I cannot open other mens Doctrine ſo freely and fully as I can do my own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. They agree with me that Chriſts Righteouſneſs is the meritorious or material cauſe of our Iuſtification, though ſome add that it is the formal cauſe, I ſuppoſe it is but a miſtaken name.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They agree that Chriſt, and pardon, and Life, are Given us by the Goſpel-Promiſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They yield that an entire Faith in Chriſt as Chriſt, is the condition of our Right to his entire Benefits.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But they ſay that the Acts of Faith in thier pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement of the Benefits, have as divers an Intereſt as the Acts of Chriſt, which Faith believeth.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And they ſay, that it is ſome one act (or two, or ſome of them) that is the ſole juſtifying act, though others be compreſent.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb facs="tcp:60968:7"/>6. This Iuſtifying act ſome call the Apprehending of Chriſt as a Sacrifice: ſome Affiance, or Recumbency, or Reſting on him, as a Sacrifice for ſin, or as others, alſo on his active Righteouſneſs, or an Apprehenſion of Chriſts Righteouſneſs; or as others, A perſwaſion that his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is true; or an Aſſent to that truth; or as others, an Aſſurance, or at leaſt a Belief, <hi>fide Divinâ,</hi> that we are juſtified.</p>
            <p n="7">7. They ſay, that the neereſt Reaſon of our Iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by this faith is, becauſe it is an Inſtrument of our Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, or of our Apprehending Chriſts Righteouſneſs: And ſo, that we are juſtified by Faith as an Inſtrumental efficient cauſe; ſay ſome: and as a Paſsive Receiving Inſtrument, ſay others.</p>
            <p n="8">8. They ſay, that there being but two wayes of Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication imaginable, by faith, or by works, all that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert the former way (if they deſpair not of Iuſtification) fall under the expectation of the latter: And I grant that Scripture mentioneth no third way.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Therefore ſay they, ſeeing that <hi>Pauls</hi> Iuſtification by Faith, is but by the act before mentioned: whoever looketh to be juſtified, in whole, or in part, by another act (as by Faith in Chriſt as Teacher, as King, by deſiring him, by Hoping in him, by Loving him, by diſclaiming all our own righteouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) doth ſeek Iuſtification by Works which <hi>Paul</hi> diſputes againſt, and ſo ſet againſt the only true Iuſtification by Faith.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Yea, and they hold, that whoever looks to be Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by that act of faith, which themſelves call the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying act, under any other notion then as an Inſtrument, doth fall to juſtification by works, or turn from the true Iuſtification by Faith.</p>
            <p>By theſe unwarrantable Definitions, and Diſtinctions,
<pb facs="tcp:60968:8"/>
and additions to Gods Word; A lamentable perplexity is prepared for mens ſouls, it being not poſsible for any living man to know, that he juſt hits on the juſtifying Act, and which is it, and that he takes in no more, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo that he is not a Legaliſt, or <hi>Jew,</hi> and falls not from Evangelical Iuſtification by faith in Chriſt. So that Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification by faith in Chriſt as Chriſt, (conſidered in all eſſential to his Office,) is with them no Iuſtification by faith in Chriſt, but juſtification by Works, ſo much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned by the Apoſtle, the expectants of which are ſo much condemned. I have gathered the ſum of moſt of the Diſſenters minds as far as I can underſtand it. If any particular man of them, diſown any of this, let him better tell you his own mind: For I intend not to charge him with any thing that he diſowns. The Lord Illuminate and Reconcile all his people, by his Spirit and Truth. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>hough I have oft ſpoken to this Queſtion in the ears of the world, as taking it to be of very great Conſequence; yet upon the Invitation of this opportunity, I ſhall once again attempt a brief Diſcuſſion of it; and the rather, becauſe the Anſwers of a Reverend Brother (Mr. <hi>Blake</hi>) to my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Arguments, and his Arguments for the contrary opinion, may wrong the Truth and the ſouls of men, if their Fallacy be not manifeſted by a Reply.</p>
                  <p>And I ſhall firſt ſpeak ſomewhat of the Importance of the Queſtion, and then of the ſense of it, and then endeavour a
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60968:13"/>
clear Reſolution, and the Confirmation thereof, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of the contrary conceits.</p>
                  <p>And for the firſt, I ſhall give you my thoughts of it in theſe two Propoſitions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Propoſition</hi> 1. The difference amongſt Proteſtants about this Queſtion is not of ſo great moment, that either party muſt <hi>Eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomine</hi> be judged to deny the Eſſentials (or Fundamentals) of the faith, and ſo to be of a different Religion from the other, or to fall ſhort of Salvation.</p>
                  <p>I lay down this Propoſition firſt, Becauſe of the Papiſts who ſtand looking upon all our differences with a mind too like the mind of the Devil; rejoycing in them, and endeavouring to encreaſe them, and to make them ſeem greater in the eyes of the world than indeed they are, that ſo they may make uſe of them for the reproaching of our Profeſſion, and take an advantage from them to make the truth and Servants of Chriſt become odious unto others.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, And I do it alſo for the ſake of ſome (even too many) among our ſelves, that ſpeak of controverſies as they are concerned in them, or as the party to whom they joyn doth ſpeak of them, or as they appear to them in the dark, or at a diſtance, or upon a haſty ſuperficial ſearch; but have not the skil (nor ſome of them, the will) to open the true ſtate of a Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and make the difference appear no wider, then indeed it is.</p>
                  <p>To the proving of the Propoſition, it muſt be obſerved, Firſt, that the Affirmers do yield, that it is not the Doctrine or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Chriſt, but his blood that is the Ranſome for one ſins, and his Righteouſneſs that is the ſole Meritorious Cauſe of our Juſtification: and that believing in Chriſt as Prophet and King, is not a proper Inſtrument of our Juſtification; and that Chriſt as a Ranſome for us, and a deſerver of our Juſtification, is the formal Object of that other act (which accordingly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in him) and not of this act of believing in him as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet and King.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, it is granted by them that are for the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, that it is our duty to believe in Chriſt as a Prophet and King and that it is of neceſſity to ſalvation, yet to Juſtification it ſelf; For they yield that it is the <hi>Fides quae Juſtificat,</hi> the faith
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60968:13"/>
by whch we are Juſtified, but not <hi>qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Juſtificat,</hi> or that it Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth not <hi>quà talis,</hi> as ſuch: They yield alſo that it is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Juſtification, for ſo they confeſs that Repentance it ſelf is; but they only ſay, that it is not the Inſtrument of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, as they think the other act is. So that the difference is here: They yield all that we affirm (if I can underſtand them;) but they affirm ſomewhat more themſelves, which we do not yield: They grant that believing in Chriſt as our Teacher and Lord is a Condition of our Juſtification, and the <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ides quae Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficat</hi>; which is all that I deſire: But then they add, that the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in Chriſts blood and Righteouſneſs is the Inſtrument of our Juſtification, and that it juſtifieth <hi>qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> talis;</hi> which we utterly deny, if the words be properly taken; and <hi>Tropes</hi> ſhould not upon choice be made the terms of our Queſtion, while there are plainer to be had. So that by this time its eaſie to ſee that neither of theſe opinions are ſuch as muſt unchurch or damn us, or make us Hereticks. Firſt, We that are for the Affirmative are out of that danger; for we hold no more poſitively then is yielded us by the other. All that they can charge us with; is this Negative, that [believing in Chriſts blood doth not properly Juſtifie as an Inſtrument (that is, as an efficient Inſtrumental Cauſe of our Juſtification) nor yet <hi>qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> talis:</hi>] And I think they will not lay our ſalvation on the Affirmative, when they conſider what we yield (of which more anon) And on the other ſide, we are far from paſſing any damning ſentence on them that are for the ſaid Inſtrumentality; eſpecially as we perceive it commonly held. Let no Papiſt therefore inſult over us and ſay, we are diſagreed in our fundamentals, unleſs he be reſolved to do it in deſign againſt the light of his own conſcience. I the rather premiſe this Caution, becauſe I hear that the Papiſts do mutter thus againſt us already to ſilly people that cannot ſee their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit: They ſay, [Is not the death of Chriſt a fundamental? and yet ſome ſay that he died for All, and ſome ſay he died only for the Elect; ſome ſay he paid the <hi>Idem,</hi> and ſome but the <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tundem</hi>] but they tell not the people the true ſtate of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, and wherein we are agreed, or that they differ as much about the extent of the death of Chriſt among themſelves, without ſuch a charge. Chriſt is the Foundation: but yet whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60968:14"/>
his hair were cut, or not, or whether he were thirty three or thirty five, or fifty years old when he died; or whether he was buried in a Garden, or in a Sepulchre of ſtone, theſe are not the foundation. So much to the firſt Propoſition for narrowing our difference.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Propoſition</hi> 2. Though this controverſie be not of ſuch Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as is denied, yet is it of great weight, and the Conſequents of the Errors of one party hereabout, are ſuch, as if they were held practically and after the proper ſenſe of their expreſsions, would be a great hinderance to ſalvation, if not plainly hazard it. And therefore the queſtion is not to be caſt by, as needleſs or unprofitable. It is ſo neer the great matters of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Juſtification, and the nature of faith, that it is it ſelf the greater. And if <hi>Ameſius</hi> ſay true, that truths are ſo concatenat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that every Error muſt by conſequence overthrow the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, then it muſt be ſo in this. The conſequents ſhall be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned anon in the Arguments, where it will be more ſeaſonable. And in great matters, it is not a contemptible Error which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth but in miſ-naming and miſ-placing them: It is a very great help to the clear and full underſtanding of Truths, to have right Notions and Methods. And the contrary may prove dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to many others, when the particular Patrons of thoſe miſtakes may be in no danger by them. For perhaps their firſt Notions may be righter than their ſecond; and they may not ſee the conſequents of their miſtakes; and yet when ſuch mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes in terms and methods ſhall be commended to the world, other men that hear and read their words, and know not their hearts and better apprehenſions, are like enough to take them in the moſt obvious or proper ſenſe, and by one diſorder to be led to more, and to ſwallow the Conſequents as well as the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leading Premiſes. And therefore I muſt needs ſay, that this point appeareth of ſuch moment in my eyes, that I dare not deſert that which I confidently take to be the Truth, nor ſacrifice it to the honor or pleaſure of man</p>
                  <p>For the explication of the terms it is needleſs to ſay much, and I have neither time for, nor mind of needleſs work. By <hi>[Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication]</hi> here we mean not either Sanctification alone, or ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and remiſſion conjunct as making up our Righteouſneſs,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60968:14"/>
as the Papiſts do: (though we deny not but ſometime the word may be found in Scripture in ſome ſuch ſenſe:) For thus it is paſt controverſie, that our juſtification, that is, our ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as to all that followeth faith, is as much, if not much more, from our belief in Chriſt as Teacher and King, as from our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in him as a Ranſome. But by Juſtification we mean that Relative Change which Proteſtants ordinarily mean by this word; which we need not here define.</p>
                  <p>The Prepoſition <hi>[By]</hi> (when we ſpeak of being juſtified by faith) is not by all men taken in the ſame ſenſe. Firſt, Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time its uſed more ſtrictly and limitedly to ſignifie only an effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, or the Intereſt of an Efficient cauſe. And thus ſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines do ſeem to take it, when they ſay that we are juſtified by faith in Chriſts blood and Righteouſneſs, and not by faith in him as a Teacher or a Lord: which occaſioneth the Papiſts to ſay our difference is wider then indeed it is: For the word <hi>[By]</hi> hath an ambiguity and in their ſence, we yield their Negative though not their Affirmative, in the laſt-mentioned concluſion. Secondly, Sometime the word <hi>[By]</hi> is uſed to ſignifie a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionality, or the Intereſt of a condition only in ſpecial. And thus we take it when we explain our ſelves in what manner it is that we are juſtified by faith, and by theſe queſtioned acts in particular. And therefore thoſe Proteſtants that diſpute againſt us who are for the Affirmative, do (if I underſtand them) deny only the propriety of the phraſe which we uſe, but not the thing or ſenſe which we expreſs by it; for they grant that theſe acts of faith are Conditions of our Juſtification, when they have never ſo much diſputed, that we are not juſtified by them, and ſo a ſmall ſyllable of two letters, is much of the matter of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, ſometime this word is uſed to ſignifie the Intereſt of any other cauſe as well as the Efficient, and that either general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or eſpecially of ſome one. This Paper is white <hi>By</hi> the white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as the formal cauſe: we are moved to a godly life <hi>By</hi> God and ſalvation as the final cauſe <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Sometime the term <hi>[By]</hi> is taken yet more largely (and fitly enough) for all or any <hi>Means</hi> in General, or the intereſt of any means in the attainment of the End. And
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60968:15"/>
ſo it comprehendeth all Cauſes, even thoſe <hi>Per accidens</hi> and Conditions as well as Cauſes, and all that doth but remove im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments. And in this comprehenſive ſenſe we take it here in the Queſtion, though when we come to determine what is the ſpecial Intereſt of faith in Juſtification, I take it in the ſecond ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>Take notice alſo, That I purpoſely here uſe this phraſe [we are Juſtified by Believing, or by Faith] rather than theſe, [juſtifying faith] or [Faith doth juſtifie us.] And I here foretell you, that if I ſhall at any time uſe theſe laſt expreſſions, as led to it by thoſe with whom I deal, it is but in the ſenſe as is hereafter explained. The Reaſons why I chooſe to ſtick to this phraſe, rather then other, are; Firſt, Becauſe this only is the Scripture phraſe, and the other is not found in Scripture; (that I remember) It is never ſaid, that [Faith doth juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie us] though it be ſaid that [we are juſtified by faith.] And if any will affirm, that I may uſe that phraſe which is not found in Scripture, he cannot ſay, I muſt uſe it. And in a Controverted caſe, eſpecially about ſuch Evangelical truths, the ſafety of adhering to Scripture phraſe, and the danger of departing from it is ſo diſcernable, (and ſpecially when men make great uſe of their unſcriptural phraſes for the countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of their opinions,) I have the more reaſon to be caute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. Secondly, Becauſe the phraſes are not alwaies of one and the ſame ſignification. The one is more comprehenſive then the other, if ſtrictly taken. To be juſtified by faith] is a phraſe extenſive to the Intereſt of any Medium whatſoever: And there are Media which are not Cauſes. But when we ſay that [Faith doth juſtifie us] or call it [juſtifying Faith] we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs a Cauſality, if we take the word ſtrictly. Though this laſt phraſe may ſignifie the Intereſt of a bare Condition, yet not ſo properly and without ſtraining as the former. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Author of the ſeond Treatiſe of Juſtification, is of the ſame mind as to the uſe of the terms; but he conjectures another reaſon for the Scripture uſe, then I ſhall ever be perſwaded of, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is becauſe <hi>Credere</hi> is not <hi>Agere,</hi> but <hi>Pati</hi>; to <hi>Believe</hi> is to <hi>Suffer,</hi> and not to <hi>Act</hi>: that it is a <hi>Grammatic all Action,</hi> but <hi>Phyſically a Paſſion.</hi> Though I think this no truer,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60968:15"/>
then that my brains are made of a looking glaſs, and my heart of marble; yet is there ſomwhat in this Reverend mans opinion, that looks toward the truth afar off. For indeed it intimateth that as to Cauſality or Efficiency; faith is not Active in the juſtifying of a ſinner, but is a meer condition or moral diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, which is neceſſary to him that will be in the neareſt Capacity to be juſtifyed by God.</p>
                  <p>The laſt words, <hi>[Believing in his blood]</hi> I uſe not as the only way that is taken by the Opponents; but as one inſtance among divers. For they uſe to expreſs themſelves ſo variouſly, as may cauſe us to think by many (as we know it of ſome) that they take more waies then one in oppoſing us. Firſt, Some of them ſay, that the only Act of faith that juſtifieth, is our believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Chriſts blood, or ſufferings, or humiliation. Secondly, Others ſay, That it is the believing in, or apprehending, and reſting on his whole Righteouſneſs, even his Obedience as Obedience, to be it ſelf imputed to us. Thirdly, Other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Divines ſay, that it is the apprehending and reſting on his Habitual, as well as Active and Paſſive Righteouſneſs; that his Habits may be imputed to us, as our Habitual Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and his Acts as our active Righteouſneſs; in both which together we are reputed perfect Fulfillers of the Law; and his ſufferings as our Satisfaction for our breaking the Law. As for thoſe that mention the Imputation of his Divine Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs to us, they are ſo few, and thoſe for the moſt part ſuſpected of unſoundneſs, that I will not number it among the Opinions of Proteſtants. Fourthly, Others ſay, that the juſtifying Act of Faith is not the apprehenſion of Chriſts Righteouſneſs or Ranſome; but of his Perſon, and that only as he is Prieſt, and not as Prophet or King. Fifthly, Others think that it is the apprehenſion of Chriſts perſon, but not in his intire Prieſtly office; for he performeth ſome Acts of his Prieſtly office for us (Interceſſion) after we are juſtified: Therefore it is his Perſon only as the Satisfier of juſtice, and Meritor of Life, which they make the adequate Object of the juſtifying Act of Faith. Sixthly, Others ſay, that it is both his Perſon and his ſatisfaction, Merit, Righteouſneſs yet, Pardon and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication it ſelf, that is the adequate Object: By which they
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60968:16"/>
muſt needs grant that it is not one only ſingle Act, but many. Seventhly. One Reverend man thats now with God (Biſhop <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi>) underſtanding that I was engaged in this Controverſie, did of his own accord acquaint me with his Judgement, as tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to reconciliation: And becauſe I never heard any other of the ſame mind, and it hath a conſiderable aſpect; I ſhall briefly and truly report it as he expreſſed it. He told me, that there are two Acts (or ſort of Acts) of Faith. By the firſt we receive the <hi>Perſon</hi> of Chriſt as a woman in Marriage doth firſt receive the <hi>Perſon</hi> of her Husband. This is our Implantation into Chriſt the true Vine, and gives us that Union with him, which muſt go before Communion and Communication of his Graces, and ſo before juſtification. The ſecond of Faiths Acts are thoſe that apprehend the Benefits which he offereth; Of which Juſtification is one and this is ſtrictly the <hi>Juſtifying</hi> Act of Faith, and followeth the former. So that (ſaid he) it is true that the firſt Act which apprehendeth Chriſts perſon doth take him as King, Prieſt, and Prophet, as Head and Husband that we may be united to him: but the following acts which Receive his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits do not ſo, but are ſuited to the ſeveral benefits.]</p>
                  <p>The opinion is ſubtile, and I perceived by his Readineſs in it, that it was one of his old ſtudied points, and that he had been long of that mind; my anſwer to him was this: [You much confirm me in what I have received: for you grant the principal thing that I deſire; but you add ſomething more which I cannot fully cloſe with, but ſhall plainly tell you what are my apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of it. Firſt, You grant that the act of faith by which we are united to Chriſt, and which goes firſt, is the Believing in, or Receiving whole Chriſt as Prieſt, Prophet, and King. This will do all that I deſire. Secondly, You add, that another act, even the Receiving of his Righteouſneſs is after neceſſary, that we may be juſtified Your reaſon ſeems to be drawn from the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the effects: Union goes before Juſtification, therefore the uniting act goes before the juſtifying act. This is it that I deny; My Reaſons are theſe. Firſt, Scripture diſtinguiſheth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our Union with Chriſt and our Juſtification: but no where between the uniting and juſtifying acts of faith. Secondly, The nature of the thing requireth it not, becauſe faith juſtifies not
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60968:16"/>
by a Phyſical cauſality, as fire warmeth me; but by the moral intereſt of a condition: and the ſame act may be the Condition of divers benefits. Thirdly, Scripture hath expreſſ, made the Receiving of the perſon in his Relations to be the Condition of the participation of his benefits: [As many as received <hi>him,</hi> to them gave he power to become the ſons of God; <hi>John</hi> 1.12. <hi>whoever believeth in him ſhall not periſh,</hi> but, &amp;c. <hi>believe in the Lord Jeſus, and thou ſhalt be ſaved,</hi> &amp;c.] Fourthly, Your own Similitude cleareth what I ſay: Though the wife have not <hi>poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> of all that is her husbands as ſoon as ſhe is married; yet ſhe hath <hi>Right</hi> to all that is her part, and poſſeſſion of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits meerly <hi>Relative,</hi> which conſiſt but in a <hi>Right.</hi> The accepting his perſon in marriage is the condition to be by her performed to inſtate her in his Honours ſo far as ſhe muſt partake of them. When ſhe is made a wife by that Conſent, there needs not any other act before ſhe can be noble, honourable, a Lady, a Queen, <hi>&amp;c:</hi> For the former was the full condition of the firſt poſſeſſion of this benefit; and the benefit immediately reſulteth from the Union. Fifthly, I conceive that theſe two acts which you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are but one moral work (though divers Phyſical acts) and to be done without any interpoſition of time, before we can have Chriſt for Union or Juſtification. For the end is Eſſential to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations: and he that receives Chriſt, muſt take him to ſome end and uſe: and that muſt be to Juſtifie, Reconcile and ſave him; to bring him to God that he may be bleſſed in him. He that doth not receive Chriſt to theſe ends, receiveth not Chriſt as Chriſt, and therefore cannot be united to him: and he that doth thus receive him, doth both thoſe acts in one which you require. Sixthly, And the caſe is much different between Phyſical and Relative benefits: For its true, that when we are united to Chriſt, we may have after need of renewed acts of faith to actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the Graces of the Spirit Inherent in us; For here <hi>Right</hi> is one thing, and <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> is another: But the <hi>Relation</hi> of Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, Juſtification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are benefits that ariſe from the promiſe or free Gift by a meer reſultancy to all that are united to Chriſt; and whoever hath preſent Right to them, even thereby hath poſſeſſion of them, ſo that this anſwereth your Reaſon. For there is no ſuch diſtance of time between our Union with Chriſt
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60968:17"/>
and Juſtification, as that any acts of our own muſt interpoſe; but they are <hi>in eodem inſtanti,</hi> and differ only in order of nature. In ſum, we prove a promiſe of pardon to all that receive Chriſt himſelf, and believe in him: If any will affirm the neceſſity of any other act before we can be juſtified, it is incumbent on them to prove it.</p>
                  <p>This was the ſubſtance of my Anſwer, to which the Reverend Biſhop ſaid no more; whether ſatisfied or not, I cannot tell: But I thought meet to recite his Judgement, both becauſe it comes ſo neer the matter, and becauſe I know not of any other that ſaith the ſame or ſo much of ſeeming ſtrength againſt us.</p>
                  <p>Againſt all theſe ſeven particular Opinions, I am now to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Theſis; when I have firſt told you, in certain diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and propoſitions, how much I grant, and what I deny; which I ſhall in ſhort diſpatch.</p>
                  <p>And here I need but to rehearſe what I have ſaid already to Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> pag. 3.4. or to give you ſome ſhort account of my thoughts to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, We muſt not confound Juſtification by Conſtitution or Guift, and juſtification by the Sentence of the Judge, and the Execution of that ſentence, which are three diſtinct things.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We muſt not confound Juſtification with the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or feeling of Juſtification.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We muſt diſtinguiſh between our firſt Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from a ſtate of ſin, and our daily Juſtification from particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Acts of ſin.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Between that which is neceſſary on Chriſts part, and that which is neceſſary on our part to our Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Between Chriſts purchaſing our Juſtification, and his actual juſtifying of us.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Between theſe two ſenſes of the phraſe <hi>[juſtified by Fatih] viz.</hi> as by an efficient Cauſe, or as a meer Condition.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, Between the Cauſality of faith in the Phyſical effects of ſanctification on the ſoul, and its conducing to the efficacy of the Promiſe in our Juſtification.</p>
                  <p>Propoſition 1. <hi>Ex parte Chriſti,</hi> We eaſily grant that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60968:17"/>
it is not his Teaching, or Ruling us, but his Ranſome and Obedience that are the Meritorious cauſe of our Juſtification and Salvation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Propoſition</hi> 2. Therefore if Chriſt did juſtifie us <hi>per modum objecti aprehenſi</hi> in the neareſt ſenſe, as the Belief of ſacred Truths doth make a Qualitative impreſſion on the ſoul in our Sanctification, and the exciting and acting, of our Graces then I ſhould confeſs that it is only that Act of Faith which is the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of this Object, that doth help us directly to the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the Object.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Propoſition</hi> 3. But it is not ſo: For the Object juſtifieth us cauſally by way of Merit and Moral procurement, and the benefit of that Merit is partly the Promiſe conveying to us Juſtification, and partly Juſtification conveyed by that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe (not to ſpeak now of other benefits) and the Promiſe conveyeth Juſtification by Moral Donation as a deed of Gift, or a Pardon to a Traytor: Therefore the Gift flowing purely from the Will of the Giver, and the Promiſe or deed of Gift being the Immediate Inſtrumental efficient Cauſe of it, as it is <hi>ſignum voluntatis Donatoris,</hi> our Belief or Apprehenſion <hi>qua talis</hi> cannot juſtifie us, nor have any nearer or higher intereſt in our Juſtification, then to be the Condition of it, as it is a free Gift. And therefore the Condition muſt be judged of by the will of the Donor expreſſed in his Promiſe, and not immediately by the conceits of men concerning its natural agreeableneſs to the Object in this or that reſpect.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Propoſition</hi> 4. Yea, Even <hi>ex parte Chriſti,</hi> though he Merit Juſtification by his Ranſome and Obedience, yet he <hi>actually juſtifieth</hi> us as King of his Church, and that in regard of all the three ſorts or parts of Juſtification. He <hi>giveth</hi> it conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutively by his Promiſe, as <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Legiſlator</hi> and <hi>Benefactor,</hi> on theſe terms of Grace. He <hi>ſentenceth</hi> us Juſt, as our Judg; and he <hi>executeth</hi> that ſentence as a <hi>Juſt</hi> Judge, governing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Laws. So that if Faith <hi>did</hi> juſtifie <hi>ex natura rei,</hi> which they call its <hi>Inſtrumentality,</hi> I ſee not yet but that the apprehenſion of Chriſt as Lord and Judge muſt juſtifie us, becauſe the Object apprehended doth thus juſtifie us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Propoſition</hi> 5. I eaſily grant that in our <hi>Sanctification</hi> or the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60968:18"/>
exciting and exerciſe of our Graces, the caſe ſtandeth as the Opponents apprehend it to do in Juſtification. This Intereſt of the Act muſt be judged of by the Object apprehended. For it is not the Belief of a <hi>Promiſe</hi> that feareth us, but of a <hi>Threatning</hi>; nor the Belief of a <hi>Threatning</hi> that <hi>Comforteth</hi> us, but of a Promiſe. For here the Object worketh immediately on our minds, <hi>per modum objecti apprehenſi</hi>: But in Juſtification it is not ſo, where God is the Agent as a Donor, and there can be nothing done by us, but in order to make us fit Subjects; and the change is not <hi>Qualitative</hi> by an <hi>Object</hi> as ſuch, but <hi>Relative</hi> by a <hi>Fundamentum</hi> which is <hi>without</hi> us in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and nothing <hi>within</hi> us but a qualifying Condition, without which it will not be done.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Propoſition</hi> 6. Accordingly I eaſily grant, that the <hi>Senſe,</hi> or <hi>Aſſurance</hi> of Juſtification in our Conſciences is wrought by the <hi>Object</hi> as an <hi>Object</hi>: Becauſe this <hi>Aſſurance</hi> is a part of our <hi>Sanctification.</hi> But that Object is not directly Chriſts <hi>Ranſome,</hi> but the <hi>Promiſe</hi> through his blood, and our <hi>own Faith</hi> which is the condition of that Promiſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Propoſition</hi> 7. I eaſily grant that Faith in Chriſt <hi>as Lord</hi> or <hi>Teacher</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> is not the Inſtrumental efficient Cauſe of our Juſtification: They need not therefore contend againſt me in this. But withall I ſay, that faith in his Prieſt-hood is not the Inſtrumental efficient Cauſe neither; though I allow it to have a nearer Phyſical Relation to the Ranſome which merit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our Juſtification.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Propoſition</hi> 8. Though there is a greater ſhew of Reaſon to aſſert the Intereſt of the ſingle Belief in Chriſts Prieſt-hood, for a <hi>particular Pardon,</hi> then for our <hi>firſt general Pardon</hi>; yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is but a ſhew, even there alſo. For it is not only the apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves to his blood or Ranſome, but it is alſo the applying our ſelves to whole Chriſt, to make up the whole breach, that is the Condition of our <hi>particular</hi> Pardon, (ſo far as a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Act of ſaith is a Condition) which though it be not a Receiving Chriſt for Union with him, as we did in the beginning, yet is it a receiving him <hi>ad hoc et ſecundum quid</hi>; and a renewed Conſent to his whole Office, and adheſion to him as our ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, remedy for recovery from that fall, by freeing us both from the guilt and ſtain of Sin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:60968:18"/>
                     <hi>Propoſition</hi> 9. It is undoubtedly the duty of every Sinner, in the ſenſe of his guilt and miſery, to fly to the Ranſome of Chriſts blood and the Merit of his Obedience, as the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to Gods Juſtice, and the Purchaſer of our Juſtification. And he that doth not this, how willing ſoever he may ſeem to learn of Chriſt as a Maſter, or to be ruled by him, yet cannot be juſtified or ſaved by him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Propoſition</hi> 10. I eaſily grant that Faith <hi>qud Chriſtum Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetam et Dominum recipit,</hi> doth not juſtifie; but only <hi>fides quâ Chriſtum Prophetam &amp; Dominum recipit, &amp; quâ eſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſionis Conditio praeſtita.</hi> But then I ſay the ſame alſo of Faith in Chriſt as Prieſt, or in his Righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>Having explained my meaning in theſe ten Propoſitions, for preventing of Objections that concern not the Controverſie, but run upon miſtakes, <hi>I ſhall now proceed</hi> to prove the Theſis, which is this.</p>
                  <p>Theſis. <hi>We are juſtified by God, by our Believing in Chriſt as Teacher and Lord, and not only by Believing in his blood or Righteouſneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argument</hi> 1. My firſt Argument ſhall be from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of thoſe that we diſpute with. They commonly grant us the point contended for: Therefore we may take it for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by them. If you ſay, What need you then diſpute the point, if they deny it not whom you diſpute with? I Anſwer, ſome of them grant it, and underſtand not that they grant it us, becauſe they underſtand not the ſenſe of our Aſſertion. And ſome of them underſtand that they grant it in our ſenſe, but yet deny it in another ſenſe of their own; and ſo make it a ſtrife about a ſyllable. But I ſhall prove the Conceſſion, left ſome yet diſcern it not.</p>
                  <p>If it be granted us, that Believing in Jeſus Chriſt as Lord and Teacher, is a real part of the Condition of our Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then is it granted us, that by this believing in him we are juſtified as by a Condition (which is our ſenſe, and all that we aſſert) But the former is true: Therefore ſo is the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>For the proof of the Antecedent (which is all) Firſt, Try whether you can meet with any Divine that dare deny it, who
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60968:19"/>
believeth that Faith is the Condition of the Covenant. Secondly, And I am ſure their writings do ordinarily confeſs it. Their Doctrine that oppoſe us, is, That Faith is both a Condition and an Inſtrument: but other Acts, as Repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be Conditions, but not Inſtruments. And thoſe that have waded ſo far into this Controverſie, ſeem to joyne theſe other Acts of Faith with the Conditions, but not with the Inſtrument. Thirdly, They expreſly make it antecedent to our Juſtification, as of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral neceſſity, <hi>ex conſtitutione permittentis</hi>; and ſay it is the <hi>Fides quae juſtificat</hi>: which is the thing deſired, if there be any ſenſe in the words. Fourthly, They cannot deny to Faith in Chriſt, as Lord and Teacher, that which they commonly give to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and moſt of them to many other Acts. But to be a Condition (or part of the Condition) of Juſtification is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly by them aſcribed to Repentance; therefore they cannot deny it to theſe acts of faith. So that you ſee I may fairly here break off, and take the <hi>Theſis pro Conceſſa,</hi> as to the ſenſe. Nothing more can be ſaid by them, but againſt our phraſe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be proper to ſay that we are juſtified By that which is but a bare Condition of our Juſtification, which if any will deny: Firſt, We ſhall prove it by the conſent of the world, that apply the word <hi>[By]</hi> to any Medium: And Dr. <hi>Twiſs</hi> that told them <hi>(contr. Corvinum)</hi> over and over that a condition is a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium, though it be not a cauſe; and I think none will deny it. Secondly, by the conſent of many Texts of Scripture: But this muſt be referred to another Diſputation, to which it doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, <hi>viz.</hi> about the Inſtrumentality of faith in juſtifying us, which, God willing, I intend alſo to perform.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argument</hi> 2. The uſual language of the Scripture, is, that we are juſtified by faith in Chriſt, or by believing in him, without any excluſions of any eſſential part of that faith. But faith in Chriſt doth eſſentially contain our believing in him as Teacher, Prieſt, and King, or Lord: therefore by believing in him as Teacher, Prieſt and Lord, we are juſtified.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is paſt the denial of Chriſtians, as to the firſt part of it. And for the ſecond part, the whole cauſe lyeth on it; For the <hi>Minor</hi> alſo is paſt all controverſie. For if it be eſſential to Chriſt as Chriſt to be God and man, the Redeemer, Teacher,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60968:19"/>
Prieſt and Lord: then it is eſſential to faith in Chriſt (by which we are juſtified) to believe in him as God and man, the Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Teacher, Prieſt and Lord. But the Antecedent is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: therefore ſo is the Conſequent.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon of the Conſequence, is, becauſe the act here is ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified from its Object. All this is paſt further queſtion.</p>
                  <p>All the Queſtion therefore is Whether Scripture do any where expound it ſelf, by excluding the other eſſential parts of faith, from being thoſe acts by which we are juſtified? and have limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our juſtification to any one act? This lyeth on the Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers to prove. So that you muſt note, that it is enough for me to prove that we are juſtified by faith in Chriſt Jeſus: for this Includeth all the eſſential acts; till they ſhall prove on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that it is but <hi>ſecundum quid,</hi> and that God hath excluded all other eſſential acts of faith ſave that which they aſſert: The proof therefore is on their part, and not on mine. And I ſhall try anon how well they prove it.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, let us ſee what way the Scripture goeth, and obſerve that every Text by way of Authority, doth afford us a ſeveral Argument, unleſs they prove the excluſion.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15, 16, 17. [<hi>Go ye into all the world and preach the Goſpel to every Creature: he that believeth and is bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized ſhall be ſaved; and he that believeth not ſhall be damned: and theſe ſigns ſhall follow them that believe,</hi> &amp;c.] Here the faith mentioned, is the believing of the Goſpel, and the ſame with our becoming Chriſtians: and therefore not confined to one part or act of ſaving ſaith. That Goſpel which muſt be preached to all the world, is it that is received by the faith here mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; But that Goſpel doth eſſentially contain more then the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſts Prieſthood: therefore ſo doth that faith.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>It is not Juſtification but Salvation that is there pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is that Salvation whereof Juſtification is a part: It is ſuch a Salvation as all have right to as ſoon as ever they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and are baptized, which comprehendeth Juſtification: And the Scripture here and everywhere doth make the ſame faith without the leaſt diſtinction, to be the condition of Juſtification and of our Title to Glorification: and never parcels out the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60968:20"/>
ſeveral effects to ſeveral acts of faith; except only in thoſe Qualities or Acts of the ſoul which faith is to produce as an efficient cauſe. To be juſtified by faith or Grace, and to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by faith or Grace, are promiſcuouſly ſpoken as of the ſame faith or Grace.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>John</hi> 3.15, 16, 18. <hi>He that believeth in him ſhall not periſh, but have everlaſting life.] [He that believeth on him is not condemned.] Not to be condemned,</hi> is <hi>to be juſtified.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation and Juſtification are oppoſed in Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8, 33, 4. Here therefore a <hi>ſaving</hi> faith and a <hi>juſtifying</hi> are made all one. And it is <hi>[Believing in Chriſt]</hi> without excluſion of any eſſential part, that is this faith; It is <hi>[Believing in the Name of the only begotten Son of God.]</hi> ver. 18. which is more then to believe his Ranſom.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>John</hi> 3.35, 36. <hi>The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand, he that believeth on the Son, hath everlaſting life; and he that believeth not the ſon, ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi>] To have Gods wrath abide on him to be unjuſtified. And the unbelievers oppoſed to the Believers before mentioned, are ſuch as <hi>[Believe not the ſon:]</hi> which phraſe cannot poſſibly be limited to the affiance in his blood: It is the [<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>] often tranſlated <hi>Diſobedient:</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, ſaith <hi>Willet,</hi> both unbelieving and diſobedient, but rather <hi>Diſobedient,</hi> properly it is <hi>unperſwadable.</hi> But of this more anon. And the faith here mentioned is <hi>[Believing on the ſon]</hi> entirely, without excluſion of any eſſential acts; nay expreſly including the act in queſtion, by ſhewing that it is faith in Chriſt as Lord, into [whoſe hands the Father hath given all things] as the connexion of theſe words to the foregoing doth manifeſt.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16, 17, 18. <hi>I am not aſhamed of the Goſpel of Chriſt, for it is the power of God to ſalvation to every one that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth—for therein is the Righteouſneſs of God revealed from faith to faith, as it is written, the juſt ſhall live by faith.</hi>] where ſaving and juſtifying faith is made the ſame, and that is to be a believer of the Goſpel, or in Chriſt, without limitation to any one eſſential part of it.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.22. <hi>[Even the Righteouſneſs of God, which is by faith of Jeſus Chriſt, unto all, and upon all them that believe.]</hi>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:60968:20"/>
Here it is faith in Jeſus Chriſt by which we are juſtified, which therefore includeth all that is eſſential to it.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 25. <hi>It is ſaid to be by faith in his blood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. But there is not a ſyllable confining it to faith in his blood <hi>alone.</hi> It ſaith not, <hi>(by faith only in his blood)</hi> Secondly, The ordinary courſe of Scripture is to call it by that name <hi>(faith in Jeſus Chriſt)</hi> which comprehendeth all thats eſſential to it. But ſometime upon ſpecial occaſions, its denominated from ſome one notable act or part. And that is, when it is the ſcope of the text, to denote more the diſtinct Intereſt of that part of Chriſts Office which is related to that act of faith, then any ſole Intereſt of that act of faith it ſelf. And ſo the Apoſtle here mentioneth faith in his blood as a ſpecial act, becauſe he now draweth them eſpecially to obſerve that blood which is the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of it; and in other places he inſtanceth in other acts of faith; but commonly ſpeaks of it entirely. And I think the Opponents will grant that as <hi>(only)</hi> is not here expreſſed, ſo neither is it implyed: for then it would exclude alſo, faith in the reſt of his ſatisfactory Humiliation, or at leaſt, in his active Righteouſneſs, if not in his Perſon or Relation: of which more anon.</p>
                  <p>So <hi>verſ.</hi> 18.30, 31. Its called <hi>(faith)</hi> entirely, or without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction by which we are juſtified; and therefore none of the eſſentials are excluded.</p>
                  <p>But it would be too tedious to recite the particular Texts: Its known, that <hi>[by faith]</hi> and <hi>[by believing]</hi> in Chriſt, without excluſion or limitation, is the common pleaſe of Scripture, when it ſpeaks how we are juſtified: as many further be ſeen, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1, 2. &amp; 9.32. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16. (<hi>we are juſtified by the faith of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and by believing in Jeſus Chriſt, as oppoſed to the works of the Law; but not by faith in his Prieſthood, or Ranſom, as oppoſed to faith in him as our Lord and Teacher) <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.11, 24, 25, 26. &amp; 5.5.6. <hi>Eph</hi> 2.8, 9. &amp; 3.12, 17. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.30. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. throughout, <hi>John</hi> 6 35, 40, 47. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.42, 43. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10 10. <hi>Acts</hi> 23.39. From theſe and many the like I argue thus.</p>
                  <p>The Scripture doth aſcribe our Juſtification to faith; and doth not limit it to any one part of faith excluding the reſt: Believing in Jeſus Chriſt as Redeemer, Prophet, Prieſt and King, is eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally this faith. <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:60968:21"/>If the Scripture ſpeaks of faith eſſentially, not limiting it <hi>ad partem fidei,</hi> then ſo muſt we: But the Scripture doth ſo; <hi>Ergo'</hi> &amp;c. It is nowhere more neceſſary then in ſuch caſes this to hold to the Rule, of not diſtinguiſhing <hi>ubi lex non diſtinguit.</hi> Firſt, Becauſe it is an <hi>adding</hi> to the <hi>doctrine</hi> of Chriſt in a point of weight. Secondly, Becauſe it ſavoureth of a preſumptuous <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction</hi> from the <hi>Condition</hi> Impoſed by Chriſt himſelf. If a Prince do make a General act of Oblivion, pardoning all Rebels that will enter into Covenant with him, wherein they conſent to Accept his pardon, and take him for their Soveraign Lord; He that ſhall now ſay, that Returning to his Allegiance, or conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Princes Soveraignty, is no part of the Condition of the Traytors pardon, but that they are pardoned only by accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a pardon, and not by the other act, will certainly be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>adding</hi> to the act of his Prince, and of detracting from the condition by him required; and ſo is it in our preſent caſe.</p>
                  <p>If God ſpeak of any thing eſſentially, we muſt not preſume without ſufficient proof of the reſtriction, to expound it only <hi>de parte eſſentiali.</hi> If he invite a Gueſt to his marriage feaſt, he means not the mans <hi>head</hi> only, or his <hi>heart</hi> only: for neither of theſe is the man. If he require a lamb in ſacrifice, we muſt not expound it of the <hi>head</hi> only, or <hi>heart</hi> only of a Lamb.</p>
                  <p>To this Argument (briefly in my Apology) Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> (having firſt excepted at the newneſs of the phraſe [Lord-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer] doth anſwer thus [I <hi>ſay, Chriſt is to be received as the Lord our Redeemer, and as our Maſter or Teacher; but faith in Juſtification eyes Redemption, not Dominion.</hi>] Repl. Firſt, The Phraſe <hi>[Faith in Juſtification]</hi> is as unacceptable to me, as <hi>[Lord-Redeemer]</hi> is to you: not only for the Novelty, but the ambiguity, if not the falſe Doctrine which it <hi>doth</hi> import. Firſt, If the meaning be <hi>[Faith as it is the Condition of our Juſtification,]</hi> then its contrary to your own Conceſſion after, that this ſhould eye Chriſts Prieſt-hood only; and its an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth, which you utterly fail in the proof, or do nothing to it. Secondly, If you mean <hi>[Faith in its effecting of our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,]</hi> then it importeth another miſtake, which you have not proved, <hi>viz.</hi> that faith doth effect our Juſtification.

If I may Judge by your Doctrine elſewhere expreſſed, you mean only <hi>That the act of Faith which accepteth of Juſtification, is the only Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Juſtification</hi>; of which in its due place: It may here ſuffice to ſay again, that I affirm not that in queſtion to the be Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it. Be not offended that I enquire into the ſenſe of your ambiguous phraſe, which I truly profeſs, is to me not intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, till you have <hi>explained</hi> in what ſenſe it is that you intend it; and therefore my enquiry is not needleſs.</p>

                     <hi>Ar.</hi> 3. If the Scripture doth (not only by the ſpecificke Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, as was laſt proved, but alſo) by deſcription, and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning thoſe very acts, include the believing in Chriſt as our Lord and Teacher, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in that faith by which as a Condition, we are juſtified; then we are juſtified by believing in Chriſt as our Lord and Teacher, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not only as a ſacrifice or Meriter of Juſtification. But the Antetedent is true: therefore ſo is the Conſequent.</p>
                  <p>I prove the Antecedent by many Texts.</p>
                  <p>Rom. 10 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. <hi>For Chriſt is the end of the Law
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60968:22"/>
for Righteouſneſs to every one that believeth. — But the Righteouſneſs which is of faith ſpeaketh on this wiſe: Say not in thy heart, Who ſhall aſcend into Heaven? that is to bring Chriſt down from above: or who ſhall deſcend into the deep? that is to bring up Chriſt again from the dead: But what ſaith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that is the word of faith which we preach, that if thou ſhalt confeſs with thy mouth the Lord Jeſus, and ſhalt believe in thy heart that God raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved; for with the heart man belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth unto Righteouſneſs, and with the mouth confeſſion is made unto Salvation.</hi>] Here it is evident, that it is a <hi>Believing unto Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</hi> that is mentioned, and therefore it is the Believing by which we are juſtified. And then it is evident that the faith here called <hi>[a believing unto Righteouſneſs]</hi> is the believing in the <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi>; expreſly Chriſt as Lord and Saviour, is made the Object of it; and is not confined to a believing in one part of his Prieſthood only. Alſo <hi>[that God raiſed Chriſt from the dead]</hi> is the expreſſed object of this faith. And the Reſurrection of Chriſt is no part of his ſacrifice or meer Prieſtly Office.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.24, 25. <hi>[But for us alſo, to whom it ſhall be imputed, if we believe on him that raiſed up Jeſus our Lord from the dead.]</hi> Here it is evident that it is Juſtification it ſelf that is the Benefit ſpoken of, even the <hi>Imputing of Righteouſneſs</hi>: And that faith here is mentioned as the Condition of <hi>that</hi> Imputation <hi>[If we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve]</hi> And that this faith is deſcribed to be firſt a believing <hi>in him that raiſed Chriſt,</hi> and not only <hi>in Chriſt.</hi> Secondly, A be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving <hi>in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord,</hi> who is the expreſs object of it; and ſo his Lordſhip taken in; and thirdly, a believing in his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,</hi> and not only in his blood or obedience. So that I ſee no room left to encourage any doubting, whether we are juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by believing in Chriſt as Lord, and in his Reſurrection, and in God that raiſed him, as the Condition of our Juſtification.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>John</hi> 1.9, 11, 12. <hi>[That was the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world. — He came to his own, and his own received him not: But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the ſons of God, to them that believe in his Name.]</hi> Here it is manifeſt, Firſt, that it is the faith by which we are juſtified that is ſpoken of; for its commonly agreed
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60968:22"/>
that Juſtification is here included in Adoption, or at leaſt that its the ſame act of faith by which we are adopted and juſtified. Secondly, Alſo that the object of this faith is Chriſt as the <hi>Light,</hi> which is not his meer Prieſthood. Thirdly, And that it is his perſon in his full office, and not ſome ſingle benefit. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it is called <hi>[his Name]</hi> and <hi>[Believing in his Name]</hi> is more then conſenting to be juſtified by his blood; and in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-ſenſe comprehendeth his Nature and Office: and is all one as taking him as the true Meſſiah, and becoming his Diſciples: Fifthly, And its much to be Noted, that it is not by way of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical efficacy by apprehenſion (as I take Gold in my hand, and ſo receive poſſeſſion of it) that faith hath its neareſt Intereſt in our Adoption: but it qualifieth the ſubject diſpoſitively in the ſight of God, and ſo God gives men <hi>Power</hi> thereupon to become his ſons.</p>
                  <p>So the forecited words, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.31, 35, 36.

                  </p>
                  <p>And ſo <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.22 23, 24. <hi>[He hath committed all judgement to the ſon, that all men ſhould honour the Son, even as they honor the Father; Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, he that heareth my word and believeth on him that ſent me, hath everlaſting life, and ſhall not come into Condemnation]</hi> Here the faith mentioned is that which freeth men from <hi>Condemnation,</hi> and therefore is it by which we are <hi>Iuſtified:</hi> And the object of it is the <hi>Word</hi> of Chriſt (and therefore not only his Prieſthood) and the <hi>Father as ſending the Son,</hi> even to his whole office of Redemption.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, that faith by which our Juſtification is continued, it is begun by this (both they and we are agreed in, though ſome yield not that any thing more is required to its continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.) But the faith by which Juſtification is continued, is the <hi>Belief of the Goſpel, which is preached to every Creature</hi> and not only one branch of it. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.21, 22, 23. And it is called, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.6. a <hi>Receiving Chriſt Ieſus the Lord.</hi>

have life through his Name:</hi>] That faith by which we have life, is certainly it by which we are juſtified: for as Juſtification is part of that life, ſo Right to Eternal life is given on the ſame terms as Juſtification is. And the object of this faith here is, Chriſt in Perſon and entire Office, the ſon of God by whoſe Name we have life.</p>

[The faith there mentioned, is that by which we <hi>have Chriſt and Life</hi>]: And the Object of it is, <hi>[the Son of God]</hi> and <hi>[God]</hi> and <hi>[the record that God gave of his Son]</hi> even <hi>[that God hath given us eternal Life, and this life is in his Son.]</hi>

                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.27, 28, 29. The faith there mentioned, is called <hi>[a comming to Chriſt weary and heavy laden, that he may give them reſt,]</hi> which muſt comprehend Reſt from the Guilt of ſin and puniſhment. And the Act of that Faith is directed to Chriſt as one to whom <hi>all Power is given by the Father,</hi> and as one whoſe yoak and burden we muſt take upon us. But I ſhall add no more for this.</p>
                  <p>To this laſt Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> ſaith, <hi>pag.</hi> 504. <hi>This Text ſhows the Duty of men to be, not alone to ſuch reſt and eaſe from Chriſt, but to learn of Chriſt and follow him: But neither their learning nor their imitation, but faith in his blood, is their freedom or Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi> Repl. Properly neither one act of faith nor other is our Juſtification. Faith is a <hi>Quality</hi> in the Habit, and an act in the exerciſe: and Juſtification is a <hi>Relation.</hi> Faith is a part of our Sanctification; Therefore it is not our Juſtification. But ſuppoſing you ſpeak Metonymically, I ſay both acts of faith are our Juſtification, that is, the <hi>Condition</hi> of it. And the Text proves it, by making our Subjection not only a Duty, but an expreſs Condition of the Promiſe. And this Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onality you here before and after do confeſs or grant.</p>

                     <hi>Argument</hi> 4. If we are juſtified by Chriſt as Prieſt, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet and King conjunctly, and not by any of theſe alone, much leſs by his Humiliation and Obedience alone; then according to the Opponents own Principles (who argue from the diſtinct Intereſt of the ſeveral parts of the Object, to the diſtinct In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the ſeveral acts of faith) we are juſtified by believing in Chriſt as Prieſt, Prophet and King, and not as Humble and Obedient only. But we are juſtified by Chriſt as Prieſt, Prophet and King, <hi>&amp;c. Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The Conſequence is their own. And the Antecedent I ſhall prove from ſeveral texts of Scripture, and from the nature of the thing, beginning with the laſt.</p>
                  <p>And firſt it is to be ſuppoſed, That we are all agreed that the blood and Humiliation of Jeſus Chriſt, are the Ranſome and Price that ſatisfieth the Juſtice of God for our ſins, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly muſt be apprehended by the Believer: And many of us agree alſo, that his Active obedience as ſuch, is part of this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, or at leaſt, Meritorious of the ſame effect of our Juſtification. But the thing that I am to prove, is, that the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious Cauſe is not the only Cauſe and that Chriſt in his other actions, is as truly the efficient Cauſe, as in his meriting, and that all do ſweetly and harmoniouſly concur to the entire effect; and that faith muſt have reſpect to the other cauſes of our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and not alone to the Meritorious Cauſe, and that we are Juſtified by this entire work of Faith, and not only by that Act which reſpects the ſatisfaction or merit. And firſt, I ſhall prove that Chriſt doth actually juſtifie us as King.</p>
                  <p>The word <hi>Juſtification,</hi> as I have often ſaid (and its paſt doubt) is uſed to ſignifie theſe three Acts. Firſt, Condonation, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutive Juſtification, by the Law of Grace or Promiſe of the Goſpel. Secondly, Abſolution by ſentence in Judgement. Thirdly, The Execution of the former, by actuall Liberation from penalty. The laſt is oftener call'd Remiſſion of ſin; the two former are more properly called Juſtification.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, As for the firſt of theſe, I argue this: If Chriſt do as King and Benefactor, (on ſuppoſition of his antecedent Merits,) Enact the Law of Grace or promiſe by which we are juſtified, then doth he as King and Benefactor juſtifie us by Condonati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60968:24"/>
or conſtitution. For the Promiſe is his Inſtrument by which he doth it. But the Antecedent is certain, therefore ſo is the Conſequent.</p>
                  <p>As the Father by Right of Creation was Rector of the new created world, and ſo made the Covenant of Life that was then made: ſo the Son (and the Father) by Right of Redemption is Rector of the new Redeemed world, and ſo made the Law of Grace, that gives Chriſt and Life to all that will believe. As it is a Law, it is the Act of a King: As it is a Deed of Gift, it is the Act of a Benefactor: as it is founded in his death, and ſuppoſeth his ſatisfaction, thereby it is called his Teſtament. In no reſpect is it part of his ſatisfaction or Humiliation or Merit itſelf, but the true effect of it. So that Chriſts merit is the Remote Moral Cauſe of our Juſtification, but his granting of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe or Act of Grace, is the true natural efficient Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Cauſe of our Juſtification, even the Immediate Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Juſtification by ſentence of Judgement is unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably by Chriſt as King: For God hath appointed to Judge the World by him. <hi>Act.</hi> 17.31. and hath committed all Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to him, <hi>John</hi> 5.22. And therefore as Judge he doth juſtifie and Condemn. This is not therefore any part of his Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Obedience, by which he ranſometh ſinners from the Curſe. To deny theſe things, is to deny Principles in Politicks.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, And then for the Execution of the ſentence by actual liberation, there is as little room for a doubt, this being after both the former, and the act of a Rector, and not of a Surety in the form of a ſervant. So that it is apparent, that as the Merit of our Juſtification is by Chriſt in his Humiliation; So our actual Juſtification in all three ſenſes is by Chriſt as King.</p>
                  <p>And therefore Faith in order to Juſtification, muſt according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſpect him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As the Teacher of the Church; Chriſt doth not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately juſtifie, but yet mediately he doth, and it is but mediately that he juſtifieth by his Merits. The Goſpel is a Law that muſt be promulgate and expounded, and a Doctrine that muſt be taught and preſſed on ſinners, till they receive it and believe,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60968:25"/>
that they may be juſtified: And this Chriſt doth as the Teacher of his Church. And Faith muſt accordingly reſpect him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt was part of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation by Power and Conqueſt, and not of his Humiliation; and yet we are juſtified by his Reſurrection, as that which both ſhewed the perfection of his ſatisfaction, &amp; by which he entred upon that ſtate of Glory, in which he was to apply the benefits.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The Interceſſion of Chriſt is a part of his office, as he is a Prieſt for ever after the order of <hi>Melchizedeck</hi>: but it is no part of his Humiliation or Ranſome. And yet we are juſtified by his Interceſſion: And therefore Faith muſt reſpct it for Juſtification.</p>
                  <p>Let us now hear what The Scripture ſaith in theſe caſes, <hi>Mattthew</hi> 9.6. [<hi>But that you may know that the Son of man hath Power on earth to forgive ſins,</hi> &amp;c.] Here it is plainly made an Act of Power and not of Humiliation, to forgive ſins.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.27, 28, 29. <hi>All things are delivered unto me of my Father,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Come to me all ye that are weary,</hi> &amp;c. ſo <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18, 19. compared with <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15, 16. ſhew that it is an act of Chriſt exalted or in Power, to pardon, or grant the promiſe of Grace.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>John</hi> 5.22, 23, 24. it is expreſs of the ſentence.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 10.42, 43. he is preached as the <hi>Judge of quick and dead,</hi> and ſo made the Object of the faith, by which we have Remiſſion of ſins.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.25. <hi>[Who was delivered for our offences, and raiſed for our juſtification.]</hi> And this Reſurrection (as is ſaid) was part of his Exaltation. And the Apoſtle thence concludes (as is aforeſaid) that this is the faith that is Imputed to us for Righteouſneſs <hi>[If we believe in him that raiſed up Jeſus our Lord from the dead.]</hi> verſ. 26.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33, 34. <hi>[Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? it is God that juſtifieth: who is he that condemneth? it is
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60968:25"/>
Chriſt that died, yea rather that is riſen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who alſo maketh interceſſion for us.]</hi> Here <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> and <hi>Seſſion at Gods right hand,</hi> and the <hi>interceſſion of Chriſt,</hi> are all made the grounds or cauſes of our Juſtification, and not only Chriſts death; Yea, it is expreſt by <hi>[it is Chriſt that died, yea rather that is riſen,</hi> &amp;c.]</p>
                  <p>1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.1, 2.3, 4. The faith by which <hi>Paul</hi> tells them they were ſaved, had Chriſts Reſurrection for its object, as well as his dying for our ſins.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8.9, 10. <hi>Pauls</hi> way of Juſtification was firſt to <hi>[win Chriſt, and be found in him]</hi> and ſo to have a <hi>Righteouſneſs of God by faith in Chriſt</hi> (whole Chriſt,) <hi>and not that of the Law: that he might know the power of his Reſurrection,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The true Nature of this faith is deſcribed, 1 Pet. 1.21. <hi>[Who by him do believe in God that raiſed him from the dead, and gave him Glory, that your Faith and Hope may be in God.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. <hi>[The like Figure whereunto even Baptiſm, doth now alſo ſave us — by the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt, who is gone into Heaven, and is on the right hand of God; Angels and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities, and Powers, being made ſubject to him.]</hi> It is certain that the ſalvation of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> conſiſteth very much in Remiſſion of ſin or Juſtification.</p>
                  <p>In a word, it is moſt evident in Scripture, that merit and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction are but the moral, remote preparatory Cauſes of our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification (though exceeding eminent, and muſt be the daily ſtudy, and everlaſting praiſe of the Saints) and that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting nearer efficient cauſes, were by other acts of Chriſt; and that all concurred to accompliſh this work. And therefore even <hi>ex parte Chriſti,</hi> the work is done by his ſeveral acts, though merited by him in his humiliation only. And therefore it is paſt doubt on their own principles, that faith muſt reſpect <hi>all,</hi> in order to our Juſtification. And the faith by which we are juſtified muſt be that of the Eunuch, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.37. that <hi>believed with all his heart that Chriſt was the ſon of God,</hi> and ſo received him as Chriſt entirely.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argument</hi> 5. If it be a neceſſary Condition of our <hi>being baptized for the Remiſſion of ſin,</hi> that we <hi>profeſs</hi> a belief in more then Chriſts Humiliation and merits then is it a neceſſary Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60968:26"/>
of our <hi>actual Remiſſion of ſin,</hi> that we <hi>really believe</hi> in more than Chriſts Humiliation and Merits: But the Antecedent is certain. For the Preſcript, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19, 20, and the conſtantly uſed form of Baptiſm, and the Texts even now mentioned, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. <hi>Act.</hi> 8.37. do all ſhew it: And I have more fully proved it in my Diſpute of Right to Sacraments. And the Conſequence is undeniable: And I think all will be granted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argument</hi> 6. If the Apoſtles of Chriſt themſelves before his death, were juſtified by believing in him as the ſon of God, and the Teacher and King of the Church, (yea perhaps without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving at all in his Death and Ranſom thereby) then the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in him as the ſon of God, and Teacher and King, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct with believing in his blood, are the faith by which we are now juſtified. But the Antecedent is true: therefore ſo is the Conſequent.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon of the Conſequence is, becauſe it is utterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable that the addition of further light and objects for our faith, ſhould null the former, and that which was all or ſo much of their juſtifying faith, ſhould be now no part of ours.</p>
                  <p>The Antecedent I prove, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.21.22, 23. [<hi>From that time forth began Jeſus to ſhew unto his Diſciples, how that he muſt go unto Jeruſalem, and ſuffer many things of the Elders and chief Prieſts and Scribes, and be killed, and be raiſed again the third day: then</hi> Peter <hi>took him and began to rebuke him, ſaying, Be it far from thee Lord, this ſhall not be unto thee</hi>] &amp;c. — John 12.16. <hi>Theſe things underſtood not his Diſciples at the firſt; but when Jeſus was glorified, then,</hi> &amp;c. Luke 28. <hi>[Then he took unto him the twelve, and ſaid unto them; Behold, we go up to Jeruſàlem, and all things that are written by the Prophets concerning the ſon of man, ſhall be accompliſhed: For he ſhall be delivered to the Gentiles, and ſhall be mocked and ſpitefully intreated and ſpit upon, and they ſhall ſcourge him and put him to death, and the third day he ſhall riſe again: And they underſtood none of theſe things; and this ſaying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were ſpoken.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Luke 24.20, 21, 22. [<hi>The chief Prieſts and Rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him; but we truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that it had been be which ſhould have redeemed Iſrael: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60968:26"/>
all this to day is the third day ſince theſe things were done; and certain women alſo of our company made us aſtoniſhed which were early at the Sepulchre — O fools and ſlow of heart to believe all that the Prophets have ſpoken! Ought not Chriſt to have ſuffered theſe things, and to enter into his Glory?</hi> verſ. 45. <hi>Then opened be their underſtanding that they might underſtand the Scripture.</hi>]</p>
                  <p>John 20.9. <hi>[For as yet they knew not the Scripture that he muſt riſe again from the dead.]</hi> By all this it is plain that the Diſciples then believed not <hi>Chriſts death or Reſurrection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet that they were juſtified, is apparent in many Texts of Scripture, where Chriſt pronounceth them <hi>clean by the word which he had ſpoken,</hi> John 15.3. and oft called them <hi>bleſſed,</hi> Mat. 5. &amp; 16.17 <hi>Luke</hi> 6. And he ſaith that <hi>the Father loved them:</hi> John 16.27. They were <hi>branches in him the living Vine, and</hi> exhorted <hi>to abide in him,</hi> John 15 5, 6, 7.— And that they were <hi>Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> is oft expreſt, and particularly that they <hi>Believed in him as the ſon of God,</hi> and <hi>truſted it was he that ſhould redeem Iſrael:</hi> that is by <hi>Power,</hi> and not by <hi>Death</hi>: and that they took him for their <hi>Maſter and Teacher, and the King of Iſrael</hi>; ſome of them deſiring to <hi>ſit at his right and left hand in his Kingdom, and ſtriving who ſhould be the greateſt about him,</hi> John. 16.27. <hi>The Father himſelf loveth you, becauſe ye have loved me, and have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that I came out from God.</hi>] John 1.49. <hi>[Nathaniel an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered and ſaith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the ſon of God: thou art the King of Iſrael]</hi> Here was the ſaving faith of the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.16. <hi>Simon Peter anſwered and ſaid, Thou art Chriſt, the ſon of the living God.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>But was it poſſible for them to be juſtified without the blood of Chriſt?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> No: as to the Fathers acceptance, his blood even then before it was ſhed, was the meritorious cauſe of their Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: But they were juſtified by it, without the knowledge or belief of it, thought not without faith in Chriſt as the ſon of God, the Meſſiah, the Rabbi, and the King of Iſrael. Which alſo ſhews that faith did not then juſtifie them in the new Notion of an Inſtrumental cauſe apprehending the purchaſing cauſe; or that the effects of Chriſts ſeveral acts were not diverſifyed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſeveral acts of faith to thoſe as Objects.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:60968:27"/>I hope all that have Chriſtian Ingenuity will here underſtand, that I ſpeak not this in the leaſt meaſure to diminiſh the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency or neceſſity of that act of faith which conſiſteth in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving on Chriſt as crucified, or in his blood and Ranſom! Or that I think it leſs neceſſary then the other to us now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe the Diſciples then were juſtified without it. I know the caſe is much altered; and that is now of neceſſity to Juſtification that was not then. But all that I endeavour is, to ſhew that we are juſtified by the other acts of faith, as well as this, becauſe it is not likely that thoſe acts ſhould not be now juſtifying, in conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with this, by which men were then juſtified without this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argument</hi> 7. If the ſatisfaction and merits of Chriſt be the only Objects of the juſtifying act of faith, then (according to their own principles) they muſt on the ſame reaſon, be the only obiects of the ſanctifying and ſaving acts of faith. But the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and merit of Chriſt are not the only Objects of the ſanctifying and ſaving acts of faith: therefore not of the juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying.</p>
                  <p>To this Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> anſwereth, by finding an Equivocation in the word Merit; and four terms in the Syllogiſm (as in other terms I had expreſſed it.) And ſaith <hi>[We look at Chriſt for ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification as ſatisfying Iuſtice, and meriting pardon and remiſſion, not as meriting ſanctification.]</hi> Repl. But this is his miſ-under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of plain words The term <hi>[Meritor]</hi> was not equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal, but the General comprehending both effects: And that which he nakedly affirms, is the thing which the Argument makes againſt. Here it is ſuppoſed as a granted truth, that we can be no more ſanctified, then juſtified without Chriſts blood and merits: and ſo the ſcope of the Argument is this: Chriſt as a Ranſom and a Meritor of ſanctification, is not the only object of the ſanctifying act of faith: therefore by parity of Reaſon, Chriſt as a Ranſom and Meritor of Juſtification, is not the only object of the juſtifying act of faith. The Antecedent of this Enthymeme or the <hi>Minor</hi> of the Argument thus explained, is not denied by them. They confeſs that faith for ſanctification doth receive Chriſt himſelf not only as the Meritor of it, but as Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher Lord, King, Head, Husband; and doth apply his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular promiſes. But the meriting ſanctification by his Blood
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60968:27"/>
and Obedience, is no part of Chriſts Kingly or Prophetical Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, but belongs to his Prieſthood, as well as the meriting of juſtification doth. For Chriſts ſacrifice layes the general Ground-work of all the following benefits, both Juſtification, Adoption, Sanctification, Glorification: but it doth immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly effect or confer none of them all; but there are appointed wayes for the collation of each one of them after the Purchaſe or Ranſom. So that if the apprehending of the Ranſom which is the general Ground do only juſtifie; then the apprehending of the ſame Ranſom as meriting ſanctification, ſhould only ſanctify. And neither the juſtifying nor ſanctifying acts of faith ſhould reſpect either Chriſts following acts of his Prieſthood, (Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion) nor yet his Kingly or Prophetical office at all. And therefore as the ſanctifying act muſt reſpect Chriſts following applicatory acts, and not the purchaſe of ſanctification only; ſo the juſtifying act (to ſpeak as they) muſt reſpect Chriſts fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Collation or application, and not only his Purchaſe of Juſtification. And then I have that I plead for: becauſe Chriſt effectively juſtifies as King.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argument</hi> 8. It is the ſame faith in Habit and Act by which we are Juſtified, and by which we have right to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of ſanctification (for further degrees) and Adoption, Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But it is believing in Chriſt as Prophet, Prieſt and King, by which <hi>we</hi> have Right to the ſpirit of ſanctification, to Adoption and Glorification: Therefore it is the believing in Chriſt as Prophet, Prieſt and King, by which we are juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> I ſuppoſe will not be denyed; I am ſure it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly granted. The <hi>Major</hi> I prove thus.</p>
                  <p>If the true Chriſtian faith be but one in eſſence, and one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided Condition of all theſe benefits of the Covenant then it is the ſame by which we are juſtified, and have Right to the other benefits (that is, they are given us on that one undivided Condition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But the Antecedent is true: as I prove by parts thus.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That it is but one in eſſence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I think will not be denied; If it be, I prove it, firſt from <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.5. <hi>There is one faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, If Chriſt in the Eſſentials of a Saviour to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in, be but <hi>One,</hi> then the faith that receiveth him, can be
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60968:28"/>
but One: But the former is true: Therefore ſo is the later. Thirdly, If the belief in Chriſt as Prophet, as Prieſt, and as King, be but ſeveral Eſſential parts of the Chriſtian faith, and not ſeveral ſorts of faith, and no one of them is the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian faith it ſelf alone (no more then a Head or a Heart is a humane body,) then true faith is <hi>but one</hi> (conſiiſting of its eſſential parts) But the Antecedent is undoubted, therefore ſo is the Conſequent.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, And as Faith in Eſſence is but One faith, ſo this One faith is but One undivided Condition of the Covenant of Grace, and it is not one part of faith that is the Condition of one benefit, and another part of another, and ſo the ſeveral benefits given on ſeveral acts of faith, as ſeveral conditions of them: but the entire faith in its Eſſentials is the condition of each benefit: and therefore every eſſential part is as well the Condition of one promiſed benefit, as of another. This I prove: Firſt, In that Scripture doth nowhere thus divide, and make one part of faith the condition of Juſtification, and another of Adoption, and another of Glorification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore it is not to be done. No man can give the leaſt proof of ſuch a thing from Scripture. It is before proved that its one entire faith that is the Condition. Till they that divide or multiply conditions according to the ſeveral benefits and acts of Faith, can prove their diviſion from Scripture, they do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we find in Scripture not only <hi>Believing in Chriſt</hi> made the One Condition of all benefits; but the ſame particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar acts or parts of this faith, having ſeveral ſorts of benefits aſcribed to them (though doubtleſs but as parts of the whole conditions.) Its eaſie, but needleſs to ſtay to inſtance.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Otherwiſe it would follow by parity of reaſon, that there muſt as many Conditions of the Covenant as there be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits to be received by it, to be reſpected by our faith: which would be apparently abſurd. Firſt, Becauſe of the number of Conditions. Secondly, Becauſe of the quality of them. For then not only Juſtification muſt have one condition, &amp; Adoption ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Sanctification another, and Glorification another, and Comfort and Peace of Conſcience another, but perhaps ſeveral
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60968:28"/>
graces muſt have ſveral conditions, and the ſeveral bleſſings for our preſent life and Relations and Callings, and ſo how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſorts of Faith ſhould we have as well as juſtifying faith? even one faith Adopting, another Glorifying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And (as to the quality) it is a groundleſs conceit that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief or Acceptance of every particular inferiour mercy ſhould be our title to that particular mercy: For then the covetous would have title to their Riches, becauſe they accept them as from Chriſt, and the natural man would have this title to his health, and life, and ſo of the reſt: whereas it is clear that it is faith in Chriſt as Chriſt, as God and man, King, Prieſt and Prophet, that is the condition of our Title, even to health, and life, and every bit of bread ſo far as we have it as heirs of the Promiſe.</p>
                  <p>The promiſe is that <hi>all things ſhall work together for good</hi> (not to every one that is willing to have the benefit, but) <hi>to them that love God,</hi> Rom. 8.28. <hi>If we ſeek firſt the Kingdom of God and his Righteouſneſs,</hi> (<hi>not</hi> righteouſneſs alone, much leſs pardon alone) <hi>other things ſhall be added,</hi> Matth. 6.33.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, If the Receiving of Chriſt as Chriſt, eſſentially, be that upon which we have title to his benefits, then there are not ſeveral acts of faith receiving thoſe ſeveral benefits, neceſſary as the condition of our Title to them. But the Antecedent is true: as I prove thus.</p>
                  <p>The Title to Chriſt himſelf includeth a title to all theſe bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits (that are made over to the heirs of Promiſe:) But on our acceptance of Chriſt we have title to Chriſt himſelf: therefore upon our acceptance of Chriſt (as the ſimple condition) we have title to all theſe benefits.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. [<hi>He that ſpared not his own ſon, but gave him up for us all, how ſhall he not with him alſo freely give us all things</hi>?] ſo that <hi>all things</hi> are given in the gift of Chriſt, or <hi>with him.</hi> Therefore <hi>Receiving him</hi> is the means of <hi>Receiving all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1 John 5.11, 12. <hi>[God hath given us eternal life, and this life is in his ſon: He that hath the ſon hath life; and he that hath not the ſon hath not life.]</hi> So that accepting Chriſt as Chriſt, makes him ours (by way of condition;) and then our life of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſanctification is in him and comes with him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Coming to Chriſt</hi> as Chriſt, is the ſole undivided condition
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60968:29"/>
of <hi>Life,</hi> John 5 40. <hi>Ye will not come to me that ye may have Life.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet here I muſt crave that Ingenuous dealing of the Reader, that he will obſerve (once for all, and not expect that I ſhould on every call recite it) that though I maintain the unity of the condition, not only in oppoſition to a <hi>ſeparating</hi> diviſion, but alſo to a diſtributive diviſion of Conditions; yet I ſtill maintain theſe three things. Firſt, that <hi>quoad materiale Conditionis,</hi> that faith which is the condition, doth believe all the eſſential parts of Chriſt office <hi>diſtinctly</hi>; and ſo it doth not look to his <hi>Exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> in ſtead of his <hi>Humiliation</hi>; nor <hi>è Contra</hi>; but looks to be <hi>Ranſomed</hi> by him as a <hi>ſacrifice,</hi> and <hi>meritoriouſly</hi> juſtified by his <hi>Merits,</hi> and <hi>actually</hi> juſtified by him as <hi>King, Judge,</hi> and <hi>Bne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor,</hi> &amp;c. And that it eyeth alſo <hi>diſtinctly</hi> thoſe <hi>Benefits</hi> which ſalvation doth <hi>eſſentially</hi> conſiſt in (at leaſt.) And it takes Chriſt finally to Juſtifie, Adopt, Sanctifie, Glorifie, <hi>&amp;c. diſtinctly.</hi> But ſtill its but one condition on which we have Title to all this.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That I maintain that in the <hi>Real work</hi> of <hi>ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> the ſeveral acts of faith on ſeveral objects are diſtinct efficient cauſes of the acting of ſeveral Graces in the ſoul. The Belief of every attribute of God, and every Scripture truth, hath a ſeveral real effect upon us: But it is not ſo in <hi>Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> nor any receiving of <hi>Right</hi> to a benefit by Divine <hi>Donation</hi>; for there our faith is not a true efficient cauſe, but a Condition: and faith as a condition is but One, though the efficient acts are divers. The Belief of ſeveral Texts of Scripture, may have as many ſanctifying effects on the ſoul; But thoſe are not ſeveral conditions of our Title thereto. God ſaith not I will excite this Grace if thou wilt believe this Text, and that grace if thou wilt believe that Text. In the exerciſe of Grace God worketh by our ſelves as efficient cauſes: but in the Juſtifying of a ſinner, God doth it wholly and immediately himſelf without any Co-efficiency of our own, though we muſt have the diſpoſition or Condition.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I ſtill affirm, that this One undivided condition may have divers appellations from the Reſpect to the <hi>Conſequent</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits (for I will not call them the <hi>effects</hi>;) This one faith may
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60968:29"/>
be denominated (importing only the Intereſt of a condition) a <hi>juſtifying</hi> faith, a <hi>ſanctifying</hi> faith, an <hi>Adopting</hi> faith, a <hi>ſaving</hi> faith, <hi>preſerving</hi> faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this is only, if not by extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick denomination, at the moſt but a Virtual or Relative di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction; As the ſame Center may have divers denominations from the ſeveral lines that meet in it: Or the ſame Pillar or Rock may be Eaſt, Weſt, North, or South, <hi>ad laevam, vel ad dextram,</hi> in reſpect to ſeveral other Correlates: Or (plainly) as one and the ſame Antecedent, hath divers denominations from ſeveral <hi>Conſequents.</hi> So if you could give me health, wealth, Honor, Comfort, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> on the condition that I would but ſay One Word <hi>[I thank you</hi>:] that one word, might be denominated an enriching word, an honouring word, a comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing word from the ſeveral Conſequents. And ſo may faith. But this makes neither the <hi>Materiale,</hi> nor the <hi>Formale</hi> of the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be divers: either the faith it ſelf, or condition of the Promiſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argument</hi> 9. If there be in the very nature of a Covenant Condition in general, and of Gods impoſed Condition in ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, enough to perſwade us that the benefit dependeth uſually as much or more on ſome other act, as on that which accepteth the benefit it ſelf: then we have reaſon to judge that our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication dependeth as much on ſome other act, as on the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of Juſtification; but the Antecedent is true, as I prove: Firſt, As to Covenant Condition in general, it is moſt uſual to make the promiſe conſiſt of ſomwhat which the party is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of, and the condition to conſiſt of ſomewhat which the Promiſer will have; but the Receiver hath more need to be drawn to. And therefore it is that the Accepting of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit promiſed is ſeldome, if ever, expreſly made the Condition (though implicitly it be part;) becauſe it is ſuppoſed that the party is willing of it. But that is made the expreſs condition, where the party is moſt unwilling: So when a Rebel hath a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don granted on condition he come in, and lay down arms, it is ſuppoſed that he muſt humbly and thankfully accept the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; and his returning to his allegiance, is as truly the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his pardon, as the putting forth his hand and taking it is. If a Prince do offer himſelf in maraiage to the pooreſt Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60968:30"/>
and conſequently offer Riches and Honors with himſelf, the accepting of his perſon is the expreſſed condition, more then the accepting of the riches and honors; and the latter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth on the former. If a Father give his ſon a purſe of gold on condition he will but kneel down to him, or ask him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſome fault: here his kneeling down and asking him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, doth more to the procurement of the gold, then putting forth his hand and taking it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, And as for Gods Covenant <hi>in ſpecie,</hi> it is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that God is his own end, and made and doth all things for himſelf. And therefore it were blaſphemy to ſay that the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace were ſo free as to reſpect <hi>mans</hi> wants only, and not Gods Honor and Ends, yea or man before God. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nothing is more certain then that both as to the ends, and mode of the Covenant, it principally reſpecteth the Honor of God. And this is it that man is moſt backward to though moſt obliged to. And therefore its apparent that this muſt be part, yea the principal part of the condition. Every man would have pardon and be ſaved from hell: God hath promiſed this which you <hi>would have,</hi> on condition you will yield to that which naturally you <hi>would not have.</hi> You <hi>would have</hi> Happineſs; but God <hi>will have</hi> his preeminence; and therefore you <hi>ſhall have</hi> no Happineſs but in him. You <hi>would have</hi> pardon: but God <hi>will have</hi> ſubjection, and Chriſt <hi>will have</hi> the honour of being the bountifull procurer of it, and <hi>will</hi> be your Lord, and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, and Sanctifier as well as Ranſom: If you will yield to one, you ſhall have the other. So that your Juſtification dependeth as much on your Taking Chriſt for your Lord and Maſter, as on your receiving Juſtification or conſenting to be pardoned by him. Yea the very mode of your acceptance of Chriſt himſelf and the benefits offered you, (that you take them thankfully, lovingly, humbly, renouncing your own worth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary parts of the condition of your pardon. There is as great a Neceſſity laid upon that part of the Condition which Chriſts honour lieth on, and that in order to your Juſtification, as of that part which directly reſpecteth your Salvation. And me thinks common reaſon and ingenuity ſhould tell you that it muſt be ſo, and that its juſt and meet it ſhould be ſo. And therefore
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60968:30"/>
I may ſafely conclude <hi>ex natura rei,</hi> that the taking of Chriſt for our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eacher and Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is as truly a part of the condition of our Juſtification, and our Juſtification lieth as much upon it, as the Affiance in Chriſts ſufferings.</p>
                  <p>If you ſay, <hi>[But the efficiency is not equal, though it be equally a Condition]</hi> I anſwer; Neither of them have any proper effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency in juſtifying us, unleſs you will unfitly call the <hi>Conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality</hi> an <hi>Efficiency,</hi> or the <hi>Acceptableneſs</hi> of believing in the ſight of God, an efficiency; there is no ſuch thing to be aſcribed to our faith as to the effect of Juſtification. But this belongs to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Controverſie.</p>
                  <p>I know not what can be ſaid more againſt this, unleſs by the <hi>Antinomians</hi> who deny the covenant of Grace to have any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Condition, but only a priority and poſteriority of Duties. But the expreſs conditional terms of the Covenant do put this ſo far out of doubt, and I have ſaid ſo much of it in other writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that I ſhall not trouble my ſelf here with this ſort of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries: Only to prevent their miſtake, I ſhall tell them this: that in a condition there is ſomewhat <hi>Eſſential,</hi> and that is found in the conditions of Gods Promiſe; and therefore they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per conditions: and there is ſomewhat <hi>Accidental</hi>: as Firſt, ſometime that the thing be <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncertain</hi> to the Promiſer: This is not in Gods Conditions: It is enough that in their own nature the things be contigent. Secondly, That the matter of the condition be ſomewhat that is gainfull to the Promiſer, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe have a merit, or moral cauſality: But this is ſeparable: In our caſe it is ſufficient that it be ſomewhat that God <hi>liketh, loveth,</hi> or is pleaſing to him, though it properly merit not.</p>
                  <p>And the evident Reaſon why God hath made ſome Promiſes conditional, is, that his Laws and Promiſes may be perfectly ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the nature of man on whom they muſt work, and ſo may ſhew forth Gods Infinite Wiſdom, and may in a way agreeable to our natures attain their ends: and man may be drawn to that which he is backward to by the help of that which he is natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more forward to, or by the fear of that evil which naturally he doth abhor: As alſo that the Holineſs of God may ſhine forth in his Word; and it may be ſeen that he loveth Juſtice, Holineſs, Obedience, and not only the perſons of men: and ſo
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60968:31"/>
all his Attributes may be ſeen in their conjunction and the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that thence reſulteth in the Glaſs of his Word.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argument</hi> 10 If the condemning Unbelief which is the Privation of the faith by which we are juſtified, be the Not-be-believing in Chriſt as King, Prieſt and Prophet, than the faith by which we are juſtified, is the believing in him as King, Prieſt and Prophet. But the Antecedent is true: therefore ſo is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent.</p>
                  <p>Only the Antecedent needs proof, though the Conſequence have the hard hap to be denyed alſo.</p>
                  <p>Here note, that by <hi>The condemning <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief,</hi> I mean that which is the peremptory-condemning ſin according to the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Commination of the Goſpel: Where I ſuppoſe firſt, that there is a condemnation of the Law of Nature or works which is ſimply for ſin as ſin. Secondly, And a diſtinct condemnation by the New Law of Grace, which is not ſimply for ſin as ſin, but for one ſort of ſin in ſpecial, that is, the final rejection of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy: And of this ſort of condemnation I ſpeak in the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The confirmation of this diſtinction I ſhall be further called to anon by Mr. <hi>Blake.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Antecedent I prove. Firſt, from <hi>John</hi> 3.18, 19, 20, 21. [<hi>He that believeth on him is not condemned,</hi> (There's the juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith:) <hi>But he that believeth not, is condemned already.</hi> (Theres the condemning unbelief, contradictory to the juſtifying faith) <hi>[Becauſe he hath not believed in the name of the only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Son of God:]</hi> (here is a ſpecial condemnation proved, diſtinct from that by the Law of works.) [<hi>And this is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation</hi> (that is the condemning <hi>ſin or cauſe</hi>) <hi>that light is come into the world, and men loved darkneſs rather then light, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their deeds were evil</hi>] <hi>For every one that doth evil hateth the light,</hi> &amp;c. The 19 verſe deſcribeth the Condemning unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and the 20. gives the reaſon of mens guiltineſs of it. And the unbelief deſcribed is a ſhunning or not coming to Chriſt as he is the Light to diſcover and heal their evil deeds. So that if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictories will but ſhew the nature of each other, I think our controverſie is here plainly reſolved.</p>
                  <p>So is it in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.12. <hi>[Kiſe the Son left he be angry, and ye periſh from the way; when his wrath is kindled but a little, bleſſed
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60968:31"/>
are all they that put their truſt in him.]</hi> The faith that ſaves from puniſhment, ſaveth from Guilt: The faith that ſaves from Guilt, is juſtifying faith: The faith here deſcribed, is that which ſaves from puniſhment: And the faith here deſcribed is <hi>[kiſſing the Son,]</hi> which comprehendeth ſubjection, and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and love; and is the ſame for all that, which is after called <hi>[truſting in him.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So <hi>Luke</hi> 19.27. <hi>[But thoſe mine enemies which would not that I ſhould raign over them, bring hither, and deſtroy them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me.]</hi> Unwillingneſs to have Chriſt raign over them, is here made (not a common, but) the ſpecial condemning ſin, called commonly Unbelief; and ſo is the contrary to juſtifying faith.</p>
                  <p>So <hi>John</hi> 3.36. [<hi>He that believeth on the Son,</hi> (this as all confeſs, is juſtifying faith) <hi>hath everlaſting life: and he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth not the Son, ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath of God abid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on him.</hi>] Here it is apparent that this Unbelief is the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, the contradictory or contrary to juſtifying faith. Firſt, becauſe they are ſo directly oppoſed here denominatively, that elſe the words would be equivocal, and not intelligible. Secondly, Becauſe the contrariety of effects alſo is added to put the thing paſt doubt. <hi>[The wrath of God abideth on him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>]</hi> is contrary to <hi>juſtifying,</hi> which takes the <hi>wrath</hi> of <hi>God</hi> off him; eſpecially conſidering, that it is curſing, comminatory, obliging wrath that is principally meant; the great executing wrath being not on men till their damnation.</p>
                  <p>And that materially this unbelief thus oppoſed to juſtifying faith doth conſiſt in contumacy, rebellion, or unperſwadableneſs, is plain in the words, [<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>] which ſignifie <hi>[They that are contumacious or diſobedient to the Son, or unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwadable.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.10, 11, 12. This faith and unbelief are oppoſed; and the unbelief conſiſteth in <hi>[not believing the record that God hath given of his Son]</hi> and that record is not only concerning Juſtification, or the merit of it.</p>
                  <p>So 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.12. <hi>[That all they might be damned, who believed not the truth, but had pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs.]</hi> So 2 Theſſ. 1.8, 9, 10. <hi>[That obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60968:32"/>
Chriſt]</hi> is the deſcription of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers,</hi> oppoſed to <hi>[them that believe,]</hi> ver. 10.</p>
                  <p>So <hi>Jo.</hi> 8.24. <hi>[If ye believe not that I am he, ye ſhall die in your ſins,]</hi> which as to the act and effect is contrary to juſtifying faith. And <hi>[that I am he]</hi> is not only <hi>[that I am the Ranſome]</hi> but alſo <hi>[that I am the Meſſiah and Redeemer.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So John 16.8, 9. <hi>[He willl reprove the world of ſin.</hi>— (not only in general that they are ſinners, but of this ſin <hi>in ſpecie</hi>) <hi>becauſe they believed not in me.</hi>]</p>
                  <p>Many texts may be cited where juſtifying faith and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unbelief are deſcribed from acts of the underſtanding (though the will be implyed) as <hi>believing, or not believing that Chriſt is the ſon of God,</hi> &amp;c. which cannot poſſibly be reſtrained to his Ranſom and Merit alone.</p>
                  <p>The Conſequence cannot be denyed, if it be but underſtood that this unbelief doth thus <hi>ſpecially</hi> condemn, not in general as ſin, or by the meer greatneſs of it, but as the privation of that faith by which only men are juſtified. For Privatives ſhew what the Poſitives are. And if this unbelief did condemn only as a ſin in general then all ſin would condemn as it doth: but that is falſe. And if it condemned only as a great ſin, then firſt, every ſin as great would condemn as it doth; and ſecondly, it would be Derogatory to the preciouſneſs and power of the Remedy, which is ſufficient againſt the greateſt ſins, as great: It remains therefore that as it is not for the ſpecial worth of faith above all other Graces, that God aſſigned it to be the condition of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; ſo it is not for a ſpecial greatneſs in the ſin of unbelief that it is the ſpecially condemning ſin, but as it is the Privation of that faith (which becauſe of its peculiar aptitude to that Office, is made of ſuch neceſſity to our Juſtification.</p>
                  <p>But ſaith Mr, <hi>Blake</hi>
                     <q>[<hi>This is like the old Argument; Evil works merit condemnation: therefore good works merit ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. An ill meaning damns our good meaning; therefore ſaves.]</hi>

to the deſcription or nature of the thing, of which it is the Privation, or that argueth from the Law of oppoſites and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions, doth argue like him that argues from the moral ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable efficiency, or effect of the one, to the like efficiency or ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the other?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, But underſtand me to argue from the effect it ſelf if you pleaſe, ſo it be as affixed by the unchangeable Law or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of God: I doubt not but the Argument will hold good. As under the Law of works it was a good argument to ſay <hi>[Not-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect-obeying is the condemning evil: therefore perfect-obeying is the juſtifying condition.]</hi> So is it a good argument under the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace to ſay, <hi>Not-believing in Chriſt as King, Prieſt and Prophet, is the ſpecially-condemning unbelief; therefore believing in Chriſt as King, Prieſt &amp; Prophet, is the faith by which we are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi>] The main force of the reaſon lyeth here, becauſe elſe the Covenant were equivocating, and not Intelligible, if when it ſaith <hi>[He that believeth ſhall be ſaved; and he that believeth not ſhall be damned.]</hi> it did ſpeak of one kind or act of faith in one Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and of another in the other. If when it is ſaid, [<hi>He that believeth ſhall be juſtified from all things,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>he that believeth not ſhall be condemned</hi>] <hi>[if you believe you ſhall not come into condemnation; but if you believe not, you are condemned, and the wrath of God abideth on you] [He that believeth ſhall be forgiven, and he that believeth not ſhall not be forgiven]</hi> I ſay, if the Affirmative and Negative Propoſitions, the Promiſe and the Threatning do not here ſpeak of the ſame believing, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, then there is no hope that we ſhould underſtand them, and the language would neceſſitate us to err. Now the Papiſts Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument <hi>ab effectis</hi> hath no ſuch bottom; <hi>Bad works damn, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore good works ſave.</hi> For the Covenant is not <hi>[He that doth good works ſhall be ſaved, and he that doth bad works ſhall be condemned]</hi> But <hi>[he that obeyeth perfectly ſhall be juſtified, and he that doth not ſhall be condemned]</hi> Or if they argue from the threatning of the Goſpel againſt bad works, to the merit of good, <hi>quoad modum procurandi,</hi> it will not hold, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Evil works procure damnation by way of merit: therefore good works procure ſalvation by way of merit.</hi> For there is not <hi>eadem ratio,</hi> and ſo no ground for the Conſequence; Nor did I argue <hi>ad modum pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curandi</hi>;]
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60968:33"/>
                     <hi>Rejecting Chriſt as King doth condemn by way of merit; therefore accepting him as King doth ſave by way of merit</hi>] This was none of my arguing: But this <hi>[Rejecting or not believing in Chriſt as King, is part of that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief which is by the Law of Grace, threatned with condemnation: therefore accepting or belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in Chriſt as King, is part of that faith which hath the Promiſe of Juſtification]</hi> And ſo if a Papiſt ſhould argue, not <hi>ad modum procurandi,</hi> but <hi>ad naturam actus &amp; effecti</hi>; I would juſtifie his Argument <hi>[Raigning ſin, Rebellion, or the abſence of Evangelical good works, is Threatned by the Goſpel with condemnation at Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: therefore good works have the Promiſe of ſalvation, or ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification at Judgement.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that I may and muſt thus underſtand the Condemning Threatning, and the Juſtifying promiſe, to ſpeak of one and the ſame faith, I am aſſured by this: becauſe it is uſual with God in ſcripture to imply the one in the other. As in the Law of works with perfect ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, the promiſe was not expreſt, but imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Threatning <hi>[In the day that thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt die.]</hi> So in the Goſpel the Threatning is oft implyed in the promiſe <hi>[He that believeth ſhall not periſh]</hi> When the Lord ſaith <hi>[The ſoul that ſinneth ſhall die]</hi> It implyeth that <hi>[the ſoul that ſinneth not ſhall not die.]</hi> And though we cannot ſay the like of the prohibition of <hi>Eating</hi> the forbidden fruit, that is, becauſe the ſame Law did on the ſame terms prohibite all other ſin as well as it. And <hi>[in the day that thou ſinneſt, thou ſhalt die]</hi> doth imply <hi>[if thou ſin not, thou ſhalt not die.]</hi> So <hi>[he that believeth, ſhall be ſaved,]</hi> doth imply, <hi>he that believeth not, ſhall be condemned.</hi> And ſo, <hi>If thou believe, thou ſhalt be juſtified,</hi> implyeth, <hi>If thou believe not, thou ſhalt not be juſtified.</hi> If you conſent not to this, you then muſt maintain that this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant excludeth not Infidels from ſalvation, the term <hi>only</hi> being not implyed in the promiſe of pardon to <hi>Believers</hi>: But if you grant all this, (as ſure you will) then it is moſt evident that <hi>Believing</hi> is taken in the ſame ſenſe in the promiſe, and in the threatning: For no man breathing can tell me, either how a Promiſe to one kind of faith, can imply a threatning againſt the want of another kind or act of faith; or elſe what that other faith muſt be that is ſo implyed, if not the ſame. And
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60968:33"/>
if it be the ſame faith that is implyed (which is a moſt evident truth) then it will follow, that if I prove the Threatned unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief to be a Rejecting of Chriſt as King, the faith then that is made the condition of the promiſe, muſt be the accepting of him as King as well as Prieſt. But I have proved that not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in Chriſt as King, is part of the unbelief that is ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly threatned werth condemnation: therefore believing in him as King is part of that faith which hath the promiſe, or is the Condition of Juſtification.</p>
                  <p>But ſaith Mr. <hi>Blake, [I further anſwer, Rejecting Chriſt as King, is a ſin againſt the moral Law, which damns: Yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more then ſubjection to the Moral Law is required than a ſinner may be ſaved]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Repl. For my part, I know no Law but moral Law. Its a ſtrange Law that is not Moral, as it is a ſtrange <hi>Animal</hi> that is not <hi>quid Phyſicum.</hi> But yet I partly underſtand what ſome others mean by the phraſe <hi>Moral Law</hi>; but what you mean I cannot tell, for all your two volumns. And its to ſmall purpoſe to diſpute upon terms whoſe ſenſe we be not agreed in, nor do not underſtand one another in: And you muſt better agree with yourſelves before you agree with me: I cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile <hi>theſe ſpeeches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> of the Covenant, <hi>pag.</hi> 111. <hi>I know no other Rule but the old Rule: the Rule of the Moral Law: that is with me a Rule, a perfect Rule, and the only Rule.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> here. <hi>pag.</hi> 563. <hi>Yet ſomewhat more then ſubjection to the Moral Law is required, that a ſinner may be ſaved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I am confident you will allow me to think you mean ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more <hi>ex parte noſtri</hi> and not only <hi>ex parte Chriſti</hi>: And can that <hi>ſomewhat more</hi> be required without any Rule requiring it? And yet I find you ſometimes ſeeming offended with me, for telling you I underſtand you not.</p>
                  <p>But I further anſwer you: The rejecting of Chriſt as King, is no further a ſin againſt the Moral Law, then the accepting him as King, is a duty of the Moral Law. Will you not believe this without a Diſpute, when you are told by <hi>Paul,</hi> that <hi>where there is no Law, there is no tranſgreſſion,</hi> and elſewhere that <hi>ſin is a
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60968:34"/>
tranſgreſſion of the Law?</hi> And need not ſtand to prove that the ſame Law which is the Rule preſcribing duty, is the Rule diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering ſin, even that ſin which is the Privation of that duty. I deſire no Readers that will not receive theſe things without any more arguing.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> adds <hi>[<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief, if we ſpeak properly, doth not at all condemn, further then as it is a breath of a Moral Commandment. The privation of which you ſpeak, only holds the ſentence of the Law in force and power againſt us: which me thinks ſhould be yeur judgement as well as mine, ſeeing you are wont to compare the new Law (as you call it) to an act of oblivion: And an act of oblivion ſaves many, but condemns none. —]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Repl.</hi> It is in more then one thing I perceive that we differ. But this is a truth that you muſt not ſo eaſily take out of our hands. Though having had occaſion to ſpeak largely of it elſewhere, I ſhall ſay but little now.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Again, I know no Commandment that is not moral. But if you mean by <hi>Moral</hi> the Commandment either meerly as delivered by <hi>Moſes,</hi> or as written in Nature; I am not of your mind, nor ever ſhall be. To be void of the belief of theſe Articles of the faith [<hi>that this Jeſus is the Chriſt, that he was actually conceived by the Holy Ghoſt, born of the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>ſuffered under</hi> Pontius Pilate, <hi>was crucified, dead and buried: Roſe again the third day, aſcended into Heaven; ſitteth in our nature at the right hand of God; gave the Holy Ghoſt to his Apoſtles to confirm the Doctrine of the Goſpel</hi>] with many more; doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn further then as it is a breach either of the Moſaical or Natural Law: yea in ſome reſpects as it is no breach of thoſe Laws.</p>
                  <p>And yet the ſame ſin materially may be a breach of ſeveral Laws; and condemned by ſeveral.</p>
                  <p>Secondly you very much miſtake my judgement here, if you think it the ſame with yours: Nor will the mention of an act of oblivion juſtifie your miſtake I ſuppoſe an Act of obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion may poſſibly have a Penalty anexed, (as, that all that ſtand our, and accept not of this pardon by ſuch a year or day, ſhall be remedileſs, and lyable to a greater Penalty,) And I think if no Penalty be named, there is one implyed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:60968:34"/>For my part, I am ſatisfied that the Remedying Law, or the Law of Grace, hath its ſpecial Threatning, when I ſo often read it, <hi>[He that believeth ſhall be ſaved, and he that believeth not ſhall be damned]</hi> and <hi>[unleſs ye believe that I am he, ye ſhall die in your ſins.]</hi> And I take it to differ from the Threatning of the law of works, thus.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In the matter of the condition; which is not ſin in general; any ſin: but a <hi>ſpecial</hi> ſin, <hi>viz.</hi> the final rejecting the Remedy; that is, Refuſing to turn to God by faith in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In the Penalty: Firſt, The Goſpel Penalty, is Non-liberation from the curſe of the Law. Not to be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or ſaved. This had been but a Negation, and not Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, if there had been no Chriſt and Goſpel: But it is a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and penal, now, becauſe by a ſpecial ſin, we forfeit our hopes and poſſibilities. Secondly, As to the degree, I find it will be a far ſorer puniſhment, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. The Law of greateſt Grace doth threaten the greateſt puniſhment. Thirdly, And doubtleſs in Hell, Conſcience will have a ſpecial kind of Accuſations and ſelf-tormentings, in reflecting on the refuſals of the remedy, and treading under foot the blood of the new Covenant; which is a puniſhment that was never threatned by the Covenant of works. Fourthly, And there will be a Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a greater Glory, then ever was promiſed under the Law of works. Fifthly, As alſo of a ſpecial ſort of eternal felicity, conſiſting in loving the Redeemer, and ſinging the ſong of the Lamb, and being his members, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, And as there are theſe five differences in the Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, beſides that of the Condition of it, ſo is there a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble modal difference in the conſummation it ſelf. <hi>viz.</hi> that of the Law of works was not peremptory, excluding a Remedy: but the Threatning of the Law of Grace is peremptory, exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all further Remedy to all Eternity: which I think is a moſt weighty difference. I know, this is not much pertinent to our preſent Controverſie; but you have made it neceſſary for me thus to touch it: But I ſhall not digreſs now to prove it to thoſe that ſee it not by its own light: But I muſt ſay, that if I ſhould be drawn by you to deny it, I ſhould have but a
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60968:35"/>
ſtrange Method of Theology in my underſtanding, and ſhould think I let open the door to more Errors then a few.</p>
                  <p>So much for the proof of the <hi>Theſis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Principal work is yet behind, which is to confute the Arguments of the Opponents. I call it the Principal work, becauſe it is incumbent on them to prove, who make the limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and reſtriction, and add a new propoſition to the Doctrine of the Goſpel: and till they have proved this propoſition, our ground is good; we ſay that [<hi>Believing in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is the faith by which we are juſtified</hi> [and this is paſt denyal in the Scriptures. They ſay, that <hi>[Believing in him as a Ranſom and Purchaſer, or apprehending his Righteouſneſs, is the only act of faith by which we are juſtified,]</hi> and not alſo Believing in him as Lord, Teacher, Interceſſor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When they have proved the reſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and excluſion, as well as we prove our Aſſertion that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth no eſſential part of faith, then the work is done, and till then they have done nothing.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, before I come to their Arguments, I ſhall conſider of that great Diſtinction, which containeth much of their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and which is the principall Engine to deſtroy all, our Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the contrary. And it is to this purpoſe.</p>
                  <q>[<hi>Believing in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt as King, Teacher,</hi>] &amp;c. <hi>is the</hi> fides quae Juſtificat, <hi>but it juſtifieth not</hi> qua talis; <hi>but</hi> qua fides in Chriſtum ſatisfacientem, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Fides qua Juſtificat, <hi>muſt be diſtinguiſhed from</hi> fides quae Juſtificat. <hi>A man that hath eyes doth hear, and that hath ears doth ſee; but he heareth not as he hath eyes, but as he hath ears; and he ſeeth not as he hath ears, but as he hath eyes. So faith which believeth in Chriſt as King doth juſtifie, but not</hi> qua talis, <hi>as it believeth in him as King, but as it believeth in him, or apprehendeth him as our Righteouſneſs.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Repl.</hi> As juſt and neceſſary Diſtinction riddeth us out of the fruitleſs perplexity of confuſed diſputings; ſo unſound Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, eſpecially with ſeeming ſubtilty, are Engines to deceive and lead us into the dark. The laſt time I anſwered this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, I was ſo improvident as to ſay, that, it <hi>[it is the general <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>heat]</hi> meaning no more then <hi>a Fallacy,</hi> and thinking the word had ſignified no worſe: But Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> publiſheth this Comment on that ſyllable [<hi>And as it ſeems you have met with a pack of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtors,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60968:35"/>
and that of the moſt Learned in the Land, that out of their great Condeſcenſion have written for your ſatisfaction. This word you think ſounds harſhly from Mr.</hi> Crandon, <hi>as indeed it doth, and is no ſmall blemiſh to his great pains; you may then judge how it will ſound from your ſelf in the ears of others.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such inſinuations, as if it were to breed diſſention between thoſe Learned Brethren and my ſelf, are not fair dealing. Firſt, I do not remember one or two at moſt of all thoſe Brethren, that in their Papers to me uſed that diſtinction! How then can you tell the world in print, that it ſeems I have met with a pack of Impoſtors, even them you mention? Did you ever ſee my Papers, or theirs? Did they ever tell you that this diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is in them? I ſolemnly profeſs it was not in my thoughts ſo much as to intimate that any one of their Papers was guilty of that diſtinction. But if you will ſay ſo, what remedy But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I intimate ſo much in my words; In what words? when I ſay, that <hi>[all that I have to do with, grant the Antecedent]</hi> and whats that to the queſtion in hand? many a hundred may grant that this act is the <hi>fides quae,</hi> that aſſert not the other act to be the <hi>fides quâ,</hi> and allow not the uſe of the diſtinction which I reſiſt. But perhaps its my next words that imply it [<hi>For the general cheat is by the diſtinction of fides qua and qua,</hi> &amp;c.] But ſure it cannot be underſtood, that its general with al the world, nor ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral as to all that I have had to do with: There is no ſuch thing ſaid or meant by me; for then it muſt extend to all that are of my own mind: and I told Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> enough of the contrary as to the perſons he mentioneth, by telling <hi>him</hi> how they owned not the Inſtrumentality of faith, and then they cannot well main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this uſe of this diſtinction. It is the general deceit or cheat of all that are deceived by it; and of moſt that in this point oppoſe me. But if Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> think either that all that vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe me their writings, do it by way of oppoſition (when many do it but by explication and reconciliation) or that all that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe me, do oppoſe me in that point, he thinks no truer then here he writes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly. And as he feigneth me to ſpeak of many reverend perſons that I never meant, ſo he feigneth me to take them actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for Impoſtors, becauſe I take the diſtinction for a cheat.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60968:36"/>
But is it not poſſible that it may cheat or deceive themſelves, though ſome never utter it to the deceiving of others? Much leſs as impoſtors with an intention to deceive: I would you had never learned this art of confutation.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, But I perceive how you would take it if I had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed this to your ſelf. And what is this, but plainly to forbid me to diſpute with you? (which I had never done on other terms then for Defence.) Can I not tell you that your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a Fallacy, but you will thus exclaim of me, as making you an Impoſtor? why then if you be ſo tender, who may deal with you? On the ſame grounds, if I ſay that your Major or Minor is falſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you may tell the world I make you a Lyar; and I muſt either ſay as you ſay, or let you alone; leſt by contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction I make you a Lyar or an Impoſtor. Prove that ever I blamed Mr. <hi>Crandon</hi> for ſuch a paſſage as this, if you can. It is not <hi>[this word]</hi> thus applyed, but other words that I excepted againſt; I will not yet believe it all one to call an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or diſtinction a <hi>cheat</hi> or <hi>fallacy,</hi> and to call the perſon a Cheater and Deceiver, and that deſignedly, as purpoſely diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling his Religion.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> proceeds.
<q>
                        <hi>[And I much marvel that this diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that everywhere elſe would paſs, and be confeſſed to be of neceſſity, to avoid confuſion in thoſe diſtinct capacities in which men uſually act, ſhould here not alone be queſtioned, but thus branded. Does not every man that undergoes various relations, variouſly act according to them? And do not men that make ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, addreſs themſelves in like variety? He that is at once a Husband, a Parent, a Maſter, a School-maſter, a Phyſician, acts variouſly according to all of theſe capacities. Some come to him as a Father, ſome as a Maſter, ſome as a Teacher; all of them come to him as a Phyſician: But only they that come to him as a Phyſician are cured by him. Believers through faith go to Chriſt that hears all the Relations mentioned. But as they ſeek ſatisfaction in his blood-ſhedding, which is an act of his Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, they are juſtified.]</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Repl.</hi> I ever granted that we are juſtified by truſting in Chriſts blood: But not <hi>[only]</hi> by that.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It was God that ſought ſatisfaction in Chriſts
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60968:36"/>
blood, the Believer ſeeks for the fruit of that ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, But now to the diſtinction, I ſhall tell you freely my thought of it, and the reaſons of my reſiſting your uſe of it, and then anſwer your reaſons for it.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, We muſt underſtand what it is that is diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: whether the Habit of faith, or the Acts? As far as I am able to underſtand them, they that underſtand themſelves, do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to diſtinguiſh of the Habit by a virtual diſtinction, and their meaning is [<hi>The Habit of Faith which produceth both theſe acts doth juſtifie: but not as it produceth the act of believing in Chriſt as Lord, Teacher,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but as it produceth the Act of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in his blood</hi>] that is, <hi>[The habit is the remote cauſe, and the act is the nearer cauſe; and the habit juſtifieth by this Act, and not by the other.]</hi> I verily think this is their meaning; I am ſure this is the moſt probable and rational that I can imagine. But then firſt, This contradicteth their ordinary aſſertion, that it is not the Habit of faith, but the act by which we are juſtified. Secondly, Then they do not mean that the act of believing in Chriſt as Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is ſo much as the <hi>fides qua,</hi> which if they will ſpeak out and make no more ado, the controverſie will be much better underſtood. For then it is a queſtion thats eaſily apprehended, <hi>Whether only the act of faith in Chriſts ſatisfaction do juſtifie, or the believing in Chriſt as King, Prieſt and Prophet, or all that is eſſential to Chriſtian faith</hi>] This is a plain caſe; which <hi>fides qua</hi> and <hi>qua</hi> do not illuſtrate.</p>
                  <p>But then I muſt add, that this begs the queſtion as uſed by them, but decideth it not. And as <hi>[qua]</hi> reſpecteth but the Matter of the condition; q. d. <hi>The habit as it produceth this act, and not that, is the condition of Juſtification</hi>] (for elſe it juſtifieth neither <hi>as</hi> it produceth the one or the other,) ſo it is the very Queſtion between us, Whether it be one act, or the whole eſſence of the Chriſtian faith that is the Condition?</p>
                  <p>And this ſuppoſeth the determination of other controverſies that are not yet determined. There are three opinions of the Habit of faith. Firſt, that the ſeveral acts of faith, have ſeveral habits. Secondly, that the divers acts have but one habit of faith diſtinct from the habits of other graces. Thirdly, That

faith, love, and all graces have but one habit. If the firſt hold, then the diſtinction as before explained, hath no place. If the laſt hold, then the Habit of Love, or Fear, may be on the ſame ground, ſaid to juſtifie.</p>
                  <p>If I have before hit on their meaning, then the diſtinction of the Habit is <hi>virtualis,</hi> and the diſtinction of the acts is <hi>realis,</hi> and they totally exclude all acts, ſave that which they fix upon; not from being preſent, but from a co-intereſt. But from what intereſt? Of a Cauſe? that we deny even to all: Of a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? that they grant to theſe which they exclude.</p>
                  <p>Next, we muſt underſtand the members of their Diſtinction: And ſometime they expreſs one branch to be <hi>[fides qua juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat]</hi> and ſometime [<hi>fides qua apprehendit Chriſtum ſatisfacien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem,</hi> &amp;c.] As to the former, it cannot be contradiſtinct from <hi>[faith in Chriſt as Lord,]</hi> but from faith as <hi>ſanctifying,</hi> &amp;c. it being but a denominative or virtual diſtinction of one and the ſame faith, from the ſeveral conſequents. And ſo I eaſily grant that <hi>fides qua juſtificat, non ſanct ficat vel glorificat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> and ſo of all the conſequents of it. As it is the condition of one, it is not the condition of the other: which is no more, then to ſay that there is between the conſequents <hi>Diſtinctio realis,</hi> from whence the antecedent (Really the ſame) may be denominative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or virtually diſtinguiſhed: As the ſame man that goeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a hundred particular men, hath a hundred diſtinct Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to them, as <hi>Before</hi> them all. The very ſame condition in a free Gift, may be the condition of many hundred benefits, and accordingly be Relatively and denominatively diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; when yet it is as truly the condition of all as of one, and hath equal intereſt as to the procurement.</p>
                  <p>And as for the other phraſe that <hi>[fides qua recipit Chriſtum ſatisfacientem, juſtificat,]</hi> properly it is falſe Docrine; if <hi>qua</hi> ſignifie the neareſt Reaſon of faiths intereſt in procuring juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; for then it is but to ſay that <hi>[fides, qua fides, juſtificat]</hi> which is falſe. The denomination and the deſcription expreſs but the ſame thing; <hi>fides</hi> is the denomination; and <hi>Receptio Chriſti</hi> is the deſcription: if therefore it juſtifie <hi>qua Receptio Chriſti,</hi> then it juſtifieth <hi>qua fides,</hi> that is <hi>qua haec fides in ſpecie</hi>: which is to aſcribe it to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>credere</hi> with a witneſs. And elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60968:37"/>
I have diſproved it by many Arguments.</p>
                  <p>But if <hi>qua</hi> be taken leſs properly, as denoting only the apti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of faith to be the condition of Juſtification, then ſtill the Queſtion is begged. For we ſay, that as the act of believing in Chriſts blood-ſhed hath a ſpecial aptitude in one reſpect, ſo the act of believing in his Reſurrection, Interceſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving him as King, Teacher, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> hath a ſpecial aptitude in other reſpects, upon which God hath certainly made them the Conditions of our Juſtification with the other.</p>
                  <p>But if any ſhould diſtinguiſh of the act of faith, and not the Habit, and ſay that <hi>[fides qua credit in Chriſtum ut Regem, juſtificat, ſed non quâ credit in Chriſtum ut Regem]</hi> I accept the former as being all that I deſire, and grant the latter: But then I ſay the like of the other act of faith, that [<hi>fides quâ credit in Chriſtum ſatisfacientem non juſtificat,</hi> becauſe <hi>fides quà fides, non juſtificat, ſed fides quâ conditio praeſtita.</hi>] And I think I need to ſay no more for the opening the Fallacy, that this diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on uſeth to cover.</p>
                  <p>And now I come to peruſe all that I can find that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to ſupport this diſtinction. And the moſt is certain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſimilitudes, that have little or no ſimilitude as to this.</p>
                  <p>The common ſimilitude is [<hi>A man that is</hi> oculatus <hi>heareth, but not</hi> qua oculatus, <hi>but</hi> qua auritus, &amp;c.] Repl. Firſt, If you take <hi>quà</hi> ſtrictly, the affirmative is not true. For then <hi>àquatenus ad omne,</hi> every man that is <hi>auritus</hi> would hear: whereas he may ſtop his ears, and be where is no ſound, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And a man that hath eyes may wink, and be in the dark, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Secondly, If <hi>quà</hi> ſignifie the aptitude, or cauſal intereſt, I deny the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude; It is <hi>diſſimile</hi>: and the reaſon of the difference is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; for a mans eyes are Phyſical efficient cauſes of his ſight, and his ears of hearing; naturally in their aptitude and potenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality determined to their proper objects: but ſaith is no effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſe of our Juſtification, or of our intereſt in Chriſt at all; much leſs a Phyſical efficient cauſe. But the Intereſt it hath is Moral, which dependeth on the Donors will; and it is no higher then that of a condition: and therefore the act that Phyſically hath leaſt reſpect to the object, may in this caſe if the Donor
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60968:38"/>
pleaſe, do as much to procure a Title to it, as that which hath the neareſt phyſical reſpect to it. As if you have a deed of Gift of a Countrey on Condition you will diſcover a Traitor, or marry one that oweth it: here the alien act hath more inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in procuring your Title, then your <hi>Apprehending,</hi> or tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the ſoil, or taking poſſeſſion, yea or accepting the deed of Gift it ſelf. So God hath made our Accepting of whole Chriſt to be the condition of life and pardon; and conſequently, the Accepting him in other Relations (in which he deſtroyeth ſin, advanceth God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) doth as much to our Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as the accepting him at our Ranſome.</p>
                  <p>Now to Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> Reaſons: when he ſaith that <hi>this diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction would paſs every where elſe as neceſſary,</hi> he is much miſtaken: for as he doth not tell us at all what ſort of diſtinction it is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Realis, Rationis, Modalis, Formalis, Virtualis,</hi> &amp;c. ſo I could give him an hundred inſtances in which it will not paſs in any tolerable ſenſe, but what are his own ſelect inſtances, from a mans various Relations to the variety of his actions and their effects. But is it Chriſt or the believer that you put in theſe various Relations? Its plain that you mean Chriſt: But thats nothing to the queſtion: I maintain as well as you that Chriſt performeth variety of works, according to the divers parts of his office, and that he meriteth not Juſtification as King, but as a Sacrifice; as he effectively juſtifieth, not as a ſacrifice, but as a King; and he teacheth as a Teacher<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this was never denyed by me. But the queſtion is whether the Intereſt of the ſeveral acts of our faith be accordingly diſtinct? which I deny, and <hi>confidently</hi> deny. In the works that Chriſt doth in theſe ſeveral Relations, there is <hi>diſtincti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> realis,</hi> and Chriſt is the proper efficient cauſe of them. But though our faith muſt accept Chriſt in all theſe Relations, and to do the ſeveral works in the ſeveral Relations, yet it is no proper cauſe of the effects, and (as I ſaid) the intereſt it hath in the procurement is meerly moral, and that but of a condition, and therefore it is to be judged of by the will of the Donor.</p>
                  <p>But you ſay that <hi>[only they that come to Chriſt as a Phyſician are cured by him]</hi> Repl. Very true: I never denyed it: But not only <hi>By coming to him as a Phyſitian</hi>; eſpecially as the Worker of this one part of the cure.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Blake. <hi>I ſhall take the bodlneſs to give in my Arguments, to make good that faith in Chriſt</hi> qua <hi>Lord, doth not juſtifie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt, That which the types under the law, appointed for atonement and expiation, lead us unto in Chriſt, our faith muſt eye for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement, expiation, and reconciliation; this cannot be denyed: Theſe Levitical Types lead us doubtleſs to a right object, being Schoolmaſters to lead us unto Chriſt, and ſhaddows whereof he is the ſubſtance: As alſo to that office in him (who is the object of faith) which ſerves for that work: But thoſe types lead us to Chriſt in his Prieſtly office, for the moſt part as ſacrificing, ſometime as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceding, John</hi> 1.29. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18. <hi>A great part of the Epiſtle to the</hi> Heb. <hi>is a proof of it.</hi>]</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply</hi> I grant you both Major and Minor: but the queſtion is a meer ſtranger to the Juſt concluſion. Firſt, it will not follow, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our faith muſt eye Chriſt as Prieſt for Reconciliation, that therefore it muſt eye him only as Prieſt for Reconciliation. And if <hi>only</hi> be not in, your excluſion of other acts of faith follows not.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, No, nor if it were in neither: for <hi>ex perte Chriſts</hi> for Reconciliation <hi>only</hi> Chriſts Prieſthood is to be eyed as the meritorious cauſe (ſpeaking in their ſenſe that take the prieſtly office to comprehend not only Chriſt as Sacrificer, but as ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, yea &amp; as obeying in the form of a ſervant, the ſicneſs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>off now paſs by:) but <hi>ex parte noſtri,</hi> the ſo eying him is not the <hi>only</hi> act of faith by which we are juſtified: ſo that <hi>for</hi> is ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:60968:39"/>
and either ſignifieth Chriſts procurement of our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, or <hi>ours</hi>: In the former ſenſe grant as aforeſaid, theſe Types ſhew us that Chriſt <hi>only</hi> as Prieſt and ſacrifice doth ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie for us. But as to the procuring <hi>Intereſt</hi> of our faith, theſe Types ſhew us not that <hi>only</hi> this act procureth our Intereſt. Nor is there a word in the texts you mention to prove any ſuch thing: <hi>Jo.</hi> 1.19. ſaith that, Chriſt <hi>[the Lamb of God taketh away the ſin of the world,]</hi> but it doth not ſay that only believing in him as the Lamb of God is the faith upon which we have part in his blood. and are juſtified by him. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18. tels us we <hi>were Redeemed by his precious blood</hi>; but it doth not tell us that only believing in that blood is the faith by which we have intereſt in it; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily thus deſcribes that faith, <hi>ver.</hi> 21. <hi>[Who by him do believe in God that raiſed him from the dead, and gave him glory, that your faith and hope might be in God.]</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. tells us that <hi>he was made ſin for us,</hi> &amp;c. but it ſaith not that our believing thus much only, is the full condition of our Intereſt in his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; But contrarily expreſſeth it by <hi>[our own being reconciled to God]</hi> to which <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Types which you mention, were not all the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel (or Covenant of Grace, or Promiſe) then extant: If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there were any other parts of Gods word then, that led them to Receive Chriſt entirely as the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as the King and Teacher of his Church, and promiſed life and pardon on this condition, your Argument then from the Types alone is vain; becauſe they were not the whole word (unleſs you prove that they exclude the reſt, which you never can.) And indeed not only the very firſt promiſe of the ſeed of the woman, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> doth hold out whole Chriſt as Prieſt, and Prophet and King, as the object of juſtifying faith, but alſo many and many another in the old Teſtament. And the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> which you cite, doth begin with his Kingly office as the object of our faith in the two firſt chapters, which are almoſt all taken up in proving it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, you confeſs your ſelf that Chriſt as <hi>Interceding</hi> is the object of juſtifying faith; and if you mean it of his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly interceſſion; that was no part of his meritorious obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience or humiliation. Its true indeed, that it is for the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60968:39"/>
or Collation of the fruits of his blood, and ſo is much of his Kingly and Prophetical office too.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Blake. <hi>Secondly, That which the Sacraments under the Goſpel, ſetting forth Chriſt for pardon of ſin, lead us unto, that our faith muſt eye for Reconciliation, Pardon and Juſtification. This is clear. Chriſt in his own inſtituted ordinances will not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guide us; But theſe lead us to Chriſt ſuffering, dying for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin,</hi> Mat 26 28. — <hi>A broaken, bleeding, dying Chriſt in the Lords Supper is received.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply,</hi> Firſt, I hope you would not make the world believe that I deny it; Did I ever exclude a dying Chriſt from the object of juſtifying faith? But what ſtrange Arguments are theſe, that are ſuch ſtrangers ſtill to the queſtion? you prove the incluſion of <hi>[faith in Chriſt dying,]</hi> but do not ſo much as mention the excluſion of the other acts of faith, which is the thing that was incumbent on you.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If you ſay that <hi>[only]</hi> is meant by you, though not expreſſed, then I further reply, that this Argument labouring of the ſame diſeaſe with the laſt, requireth no other anſwer. Firſt, The Sacraments being not the whole Goſpel, you cannot prove your <hi>Excluſion</hi> from them unleſs you prove ſomewhat <hi>excluſive</hi> in them (which you attempt not, that I ſee,) Secondly, If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you underſtand the Minor excluſively as to all other parts of Chriſts office, I deny it, and the texts cited ſay not a word to prove it. Thirdly, And if they did, yet faith may eye a dying Chriſt only as purchaſing Pardon; and yet <hi>ex parte Chriſti</hi> that act that ſo eyeth him may not be the only act that is the condition of our Title to a dying Chriſt or to the pardon purchaſed. Fourthly, And yet (though it would not ſerve your turn) even <hi>ex parte Chriſti,</hi> your excluſion is ſo far from being proved that its contradicted both by the Sacraments and by Scriptures: much more <hi>ex parte noſtri,</hi> your <hi>excuſion</hi> of the other acts of faith. For, Firſt, In Baptiſm its apparent (which is appointed for our ſolemn initiation into a ſtate of Juſtification; which the Lords Supper is not.) Firſt, Chriſt foundeth it in his Dominion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18. <hi>All power is given to me in Heaven and Earth; go ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> &amp;c. Secondly, He maketh the very nature of it to be an entering men into a ſtate of Diſciples, and ſo engaging them
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60968:40"/>
to him as their Maſter, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. <hi>Go ye therefore and Diſciple (or teach) all Nations baptizing them.</hi> Thirdly, The words of the Jews to <hi>John (If thou be not that Chriſt nor</hi> Elias, <hi>nor that Prophet, why baptizeſt thou?</hi> John 1.25.) and their flocking to his baptiſm, and the words of <hi>Paul,</hi> I <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.15. <hi>(I thank God that I baptized none of you, — leſt any ſhould ſay, that I baptized in my own name)</hi> do plainly ſhew that baptizing was then taken, as an entering into a ſtate of Diſciples. And I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore proved that baptiſm doth liſt us under Chriſt the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, King and Maſter of the Church. Fourthly, And therefore the Church hath ever baptized into the name of the Father Son and Holy Ghoſt, with an abrenunciation of the fleſh, the world and the devil, not only as oppoſite to Chriſts blood, but as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſites to his Kingdom and Doctrine. Fifthly, And the very water ſignifieth the ſpirit of Chriſt as well as his blood: Though I think not, as Mr. <hi>Mead,</hi> that it ſignifieth the ſpirit only. Sixthly, And our coming from under the water was to ſignifie our Reſurrection with Chriſt, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. ſhews. So that it is certain that Chriſt in all parts of his office is propounded in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm to be the object of our faith, and this baptiſm comprizing all this, is ſaid to be <hi>[for the Remiſſion of ſin.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, And though the Lords ſupper ſuppoſe us juſtified, yet he underſtandeth not well what he doth, that thinks that Chriſt only as dying is there propounded to our faith. For, Firſt, In our very receiving we profeſs Obedience to Chriſt as King, that hath enjoyned it by his Law. Secondly, And to Chriſt our Teacher that hath taught us thus to do. Thirdly, The ſigns themſelves are a viſible word (of Chriſt our Teacher) and teach us his ſufferings, promiſes, our duty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Fourthly, By taking, eating, and drinking, we renew our Covenant with Chriſt; And that Covenant is made with him not only as Prieſt, but as the Glorified Lord and King of the Church. On his part the thing promiſed which the Sacrament ſealeth, is, (not that Chriſt will dye for us, for thats done already, but) that Chriſt will actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally pardon us on the account of his merits. And this he doth as King: and that he will ſanctifie, preſerve, ſtrengthen, and glorifie us: all which he doth as King, though he purchaſed them as a ſacrifice. On our part we deliver up our ſelves to him
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60968:40"/>
to be wholly his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even his Diſciples, and Subjects, as well as pardoned ones. Fifthly, Yea the very bread and wine ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and drank do ſignifie our ſpiritual Union and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Jeſus, who is pleaſed to become one with us, as that bread and wine is one with our ſubſtance. And ſurely it is to Chriſt as our Head that we are United, and not only as dying for us: and as to our Husband, who is moſt dearly to be loved by us, and is to rule us, and we to be ſubject to him, being made bone of his bone, and fleſh of his fleſh; <hi>Ephe.</hi> 5.23, 24, 25, 30. Sixthly, We are to do it as in remembrance of his death, ſo alſo in expectation of his <hi>comming,</hi> which will be in Kingly Glory, when he will drink with us the fruit of the Vine new in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of his Father.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object</hi> But Chriſt doth not pardon ſin in all theſe reſpects. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But in the Sacrament he is repreſented to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in entirely in all theſe reſpects. Secondly, And he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doneth as King, though he merit it as a ſacrifice. And as his Sacrifice and Merit are the cauſe of all that following, ſo there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ſpecially repreſented in the Sacrament, not excluding but including the reſt. Thirdly, Believing in Chriſt as King and Prophet, even as his offices reſpect his Honor and our ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, may be as truly the condition of our Juſtification, as belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in his blood.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>Reply. <hi>Concedo totum</hi>: The concluſion can be but this <hi>[therefore faith muſt go to the blood of Chriſt for attonement]</hi> Who ever queſtioned this I But your Theſis which you ſet at the Head of your Arguments, was [<hi>Faith in Chriſt</hi> qua <hi>Lord doth not juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie</hi>] which is little kin to any of your Arguments.</p>
                  <p>But in the explication, you have here, at laſt, the term <hi>Only,</hi> and therefore I may take that to be ſuppoſed in the Argument; But then with that Addition. I deny your Minor. The texts mentioned ſay nothing to prove it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. hath no <hi>only</hi> in it, nor any thing excluſive of the other acts of Chriſt: And if it had, yet it would not follow
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60968:41"/>
that all other acts of our faith were excluded. As his blood is the meritorious cauſe, and ſo the foundation of all the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, and ſo all the Applying Cauſes are ſuppoſed in the mention of it and not excluded ſo are all other acts of our faith in the mention of that act.</p>
                  <p>

                     <hi>Ephe.</hi> 1 7. and 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7 do neither of them exclude either the other acts of Chriſt, or other acts of faith: Nay <hi>John</hi> ſeems to make ſomewhat elſe the condition on our part, then the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in that blood only, when he ſaith there <hi>[If we walk in the Light as he is in the Light, we have fellowſhip one with another, and the blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Son cleanſeth us from all ſin]</hi> Or if you think this <hi>[if]</hi> denoteth but a ſign, yet other texts will plainly prove more.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, If I were to go only to the blood of Chriſt for atonement, yet it would not follow, that going to that blood only for it, is the <hi>only</hi> act of Faith on which Juſtification is promiſed or given me in the Goſpel, as is before declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Blake. <hi>You demand, [Will you exclude his Obedience, Reſurrection, interceſſion]? To which I only ſay, I marvell at the queſtion: If I exclude theſe, I exclude his blood: His ſhedding of blood was in Obedience,</hi> John 10.18. Phil. 2.8. <hi>his Reſurrection was his freedom from the bands of death, and an evidence of our diſcharge by blood: His Interceſſion is founded on his blood. He inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes not as we by bare petition, but by merit: He preſents his blood as the high Prieſt in the Holy of Holies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Repl.</hi> It was the thing I had to do, to prove that <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. and thoſe other texts, are not excluſive of all but his blood, and that the word <hi>Only</hi> is no more meant, then it is expreſſed in them. And now you grant it me: And needs muſt do it, while Scripture tells us, that <hi>by the Obedience of one, many are made Righteous,</hi> Rom. 5.19. <hi>and that he is Riſen for our Juſtification,</hi> Rom. 4 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>5. and that <hi>Righteouſneſs ſhall be imputed to us, if we believe on him that raiſed up Jeſus our Lord from the dead.</hi> ver. 24.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60968:41"/>
and <hi>It is God that juſtifieth: who is he that condemneth? it is Chriſt that dyed, yea, rather that is riſen again, who is even at the right hand of God; who alſo maketh Interceſſion for us, Rom.</hi> 8 33, 34. he that believeth all theſe texts will not add <hi>only</hi> to the firſt, at leaſt if he underſtand them; for they do not contradict each other. Well! but you marvell at my queſtion! I am glad of that! Are we ſo well agreed, that you marvell at my ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of this difference? To ſatiſfie you, my queſtion im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed this Argument. If the Reſurrection, Interceſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be not in thoſe texts excluded, nor faith in them, then we may not add <hi>only</hi> to interpret them; but <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Ergo.</p>
                  <p>But let us hear the reaſons of your marveling. Firſt, As to Obedience, you ſay <hi>His ſhedding of blood was in Obedience.</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. But though all blood-ſhed was in Obedience, yet all Obedience was not by blood-ſhed, nor ſuffering neither. And the text <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19 ſeems to ſpeak of Obedience as Obedience, and not only as in blood ſhed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, You ſay <hi>His Reſurrection was his freedom,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Anſ.</hi> But Suffering is one thing, and freedom from ſuffering is another thing. I herefore faith to our juſtification muſt eye Chriſts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt and freedom from death as well as his death it ſelf. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Reſurrection was an act of Power, and his Entrance on his Kingdom, and not a meer act of Prieſthood: Nor will you ever prove that faith (to Juſtification) muſt only look at the Reſurrection as connoting the death from which he riſeth.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, You ſay, <hi>His Interceſſion is founded on his blood,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> So is his Kingdom and Lordſhip, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14 9. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.9, 10. It ſeems then faith in order to Juſtification muſt not only look at Chriſts blood, but that which is founded on it. His Government, in Legiſlation, Judgement, Execution, is all founded in his blood. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe <hi>he hath drank of the brook in the way, therefore did he lift up the Head,</hi> Pſalme 110.7.</p>
                  <p>You add <hi>He Interceeds by Merit.</hi> Anſwer. Not by new purchaſing Merit, but by the virtue of his former Merit, and the collation of the effects of it from the Father. And ſo he Reigneth and Governeth both by virtue of former Merit, and for the applying that Merit and attaining of its Ends.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:60968:42"/>Whereas therefore you ſay <hi>If I exclude theſe, I ſhall exclude his blood</hi>; It is a weighty Anſwer. And the like you may ſay alſo of his Kingly and Prophetical office. The operation of them are ſo woven and twiſted together by infinite wiſdom, that all do harmoniouſly concur to the attainment of the ends of each one; and if you lay by one, you lay by all; you exclude Chriſts blood as to the end of Juſtification, if you include not his Kingly and Prophetical offices, and look not to him as making the Covenant or Grant of pardon in his blood; and as teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and perſwading and working us into Union with himſelf that we may have part in his blood: and as conferring daily the fruits of his blood as King, in Renewed pardon of daily ſins; and as juſtifying us at Judgement as King and Judge. His blood is a Foundation without a building, if you take it without all theſe: Overlook theſe, and you deny it as well as by over-looking his Reſurrection.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, <hi>Seſſion at Gods Right Hand</hi> which is one thing that the Apoſtle inſtanceth in, <hi>Romans</hi> 8.35. is his Glorification it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>And when you ſay [<hi>He preſents his blood as High Prieſt,</hi> &amp;c.] I anſwer. But not as a renewed ſacrifice; preſenting it is not ſhedding it, or offering it in ſacrifice. And the preſentation is not a minding God of what he knows not, or hath forgot, or an arguing with him to extort his Mercy; but as the value and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſts ſacrifice hath its continual Being before God, ſo Chriſt doth give out all his benefis to his Church as procured and received from the Father by the merit of his ſacrifice: and this is his Interceſſion. But your arguing yiedeth, that to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, we muſt not only believe in Chriſt as ſhedding his blood for us on earth, but alſo on Chriſt as preſenting his blood for us in heaven: which is enough to my ends.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Blake. <hi>You tell me further that the thing I had to prove was not the excluſion of faith in his commands, but of faith in Chriſt as Lord and Teacher. I can no more diſtinguiſh Lord and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand than I can Blood and Sacrifice; it being the office of a Lord to Rule, as of blood to make atonement.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Repl.</hi> Firſt, If you cannot diſtinguiſh, there's no remedy but you muſt err by confuſion. Its obvious to an ordinary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60968:42"/>
that even <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Sacrifice</hi> may as well be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed as <hi>Earth and Man,</hi> or <hi>Ink and Writing; [Blood]</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying only the matter, yea but part of the matter; and <hi>[a Sacrifice]</hi> ſignifying that matter with its moral Form.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, And its as obvious that <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Command</hi> do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe differ then <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Sacrifice</hi>; for <hi>Lord,</hi> as it ſignefieth princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally a Proprietary, is <hi>toto caelo</hi> diſtinct from command, as ſtanding in another <hi>ſeries</hi>: And <hi>Lord</hi> as it ſignifieth a Rector, doth differ from Command, as the efficient from the effect; which is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then as part of the matter doth from the whole informed.</p>
                  <p>It is no Argument againſt the truth which I maintain, that you cannot diſtinguiſh theſe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If it be <hi>the office of a Lord to Rule</hi>; then you may well diſtinguiſh betwen the office and the work: But indeed in the firſt ſenſe, <hi>Lord</hi> ſignifieth a Proprietary, and but in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond a Rulers Power; which is not alwayes properly called an Office neither; no more then the Soveraign is properly an Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, To make <hi>Atonement</hi> is not all one as to <hi>be a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> which was your former term: for Atonement is the effect of a Sacrifice: not of blood as blood, but as a Sacrifice meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious and accepted.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, And as to the point in difference between us, the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is palpable and weighty between believing in Chriſt as King, and believing or obeying his Commands. As his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Power belongs to the <hi>Conſtitution</hi> of his myſtical body or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publike, and his commands that flow from it to the <hi>Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>: ſo Subjection to his Power and Relation, and conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this conſtitution do enter us into the Body and unite us to him: when believing and obeying his <hi>Laws for Adminiſtration,</hi> do follow as the fruits. If you could have diſtinguiſhed between the Root and Fruits, between Faith and Obedience, between <hi>making Diſciples, and teaching to obſerve,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19.2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>or becoming Diſciples,</hi> and <hi>Learning</hi>; you might have diſtinguiſhed between <hi>becoming a Subject</hi> and <hi>obeying.</hi> And what ever you do, I am ſure others of your way do grant, that <hi>Receiving Chriſt as Lord and Teacher,</hi> is the faith that juſtifieth, though not <hi>qua talis,</hi> but they will not ſay ſo by receiving or obeying his
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60968:43"/>
                     <hi>Governing</hi> Laws, which are diſtinct from the conſtitution or fundamental Law.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Blake. <hi>You yet tell me it was fitteſt for</hi> Paul <hi>to ſay, by faith in his blood; becauſe he intends to connote both what we are juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by</hi> ex parte Chriſti, <hi>and what we are juſtified by</hi> ex parte noſtri; <hi>but the former principally. To this I ſay. If this were fitteſt for</hi> Paul, <hi>then it is unfit for any to come in with Animiadverſions, and tell us of any other thing</hi> ex parte Chriſti, <hi>or</hi> ex parte noſtri <hi>for Juſtification. I pray you reſt here and we are well agreed. Here is Chriſts Prieſtly Office on his part alone, and I am reſolved to look no further.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Repl.</hi> Though I may not hope to change you, if you are Reſolved, yet I may take leave to render a reaſon of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary as peremptory Reſolution: I am reſolved to look further <hi>ex parte Chriſti,</hi> then to his blood, yea or his whole Merit yea or whole Prieſt-hood for my Juſtification; even to whole Chriſt, and in ſpecial to his Regal conſtitution and ſentence. Yet I reſt where you deſire me, as to the Truth of what I ſaid; and if we are agreed, its better then I can perceive in your other words. Firſt, Though <hi>Paul</hi> there mention the <hi>Prieſtly office alone,</hi> yet that's not all his Epiſtles, nor all the Scriptures; nor doth he here exclude the reſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It may be fitteſt to <hi>Pauls</hi> deſign in that particular diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to mention <hi>faith in his blood,</hi> and yet it may be fit for another to come in with animadverſions, and tell you of more neceſſary both <hi>ex parte Chriſti &amp; noſtri.</hi> Its common to expreſs our meaning of a <hi>whole</hi> in a ſummary notion taken from a chief part: And indeed in Political diſcourſes it is hard to meet with a fitter way of expreſſion.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf was not of your opinion, nor Chriſt neither, and yet it was not unfit for them to diſcover it. The ſame <hi>Paul</hi> that here thought it fitteſt to mention <hi>faith in his blood,</hi> did elſewhere think it fit to mention <hi>Jusſtification by his Obedience,</hi> and <hi>that he Roſe again for our Juſtification</hi>; and to promiſe Jmputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Righteouſneſs to us, <hi>if we believe on him that raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up Jeſus our Lord from the dead,</hi> Rom. 4.24, 25. with the like paſſages before mentioned. But moſt frequently it is the comprehenſive phraſe of <hi>[believing in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord]</hi>
                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:60968:43"/>
that he uſeth. The ſame Chriſt that calleth himſelf ſo oft the Lord and Maſter of his followers, excludeth not thereby his other Relations And when he ſaith in one place <hi>[I am the Vine]</hi> he may freely ſay elſe where, [<hi>I am the good Shepherd</hi>:] And he that ſpeaketh of <hi>laying down his life for the ſheep,</hi> doth not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by make it unfit to mention other Paſtoral a is for them. And he that tels us of <hi>eating his fleſh and drinking his blood,</hi> intended not the excluſion of the <hi>ſpirit that quickneth.</hi> I am therefore Reſolved by his Grace to adhere to whole Chriſt as the object of that faith which is the Condition of Juſtification. And I think this full comprehenſive faith is ſafer then the groundleſly diſtinguiſhing faith; and this Doctrine more agreeable <hi>to the</hi> Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Blake.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>Our faith muſt look on Chriſt ſo as to obtain righteouſneſs by him, by virtue of which we may appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God as righteous: But it is by his Obedience as a ſervant that we obtain righteouſneſs, and ſtand before God as righteous,</hi> Rom. 5.19. <hi>by the obedience of one many are made righteous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Repl.</hi> Firſt, I grant the whole: but its nothing to our Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. Its a ſtrange error that runs through ſo many Arguments, that they ſhould be impertinent to the queſtion. You ſhould have concluded that <hi>Faith in Chriſt</hi> qua <hi>Lord, doth not juſtifie</hi>] which <hi>in terminis</hi> is the concluſion that you undertook to prove: whereas all that this Argument will conclude, is, that [<hi>our faith muſt look at Chriſts obedience for Righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c.] which I have ſaid no more againſt then you have done.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, But if <hi>[Only]</hi> be implyed as adjoyned to <hi>[obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence]</hi> then it will exclude his ſuffering as ſuffering in that formal reſpect, and take it in only as the Matter of his Obedience.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, And by this Argument you deſtroy what you not only mantained, but reſolved to ſtick to in the laſt, that is, that it is not fit for any one to tell us of any other thing then faith in his blood for juſtification, and that you are reſolved to look no further then Chriſts Prieſtly office alone. For Obedience extendeth further then blood-ſhed: therefore if we are juſtified by Chriſts whole obedience, then by more then his blood. Yea you will be put hard to it to prove, that all Chriſts obedience was offered by him as a Preiſt to his Father: It belongs to a
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:60968:44"/>
Subject, a Servant, a Son to obey; but obedience is far from being proper to a Prieſt.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, If you intend the Major excluſively as to all other conſiderations of the object, I ſtill deny it as falſe. Our faith (even as the condition of Juſtification) muſt look at Chriſt, <hi>not only</hi> to obtain Righteouſneſs by him, but alſo to ſubject our ſelves to his Teaching and Government, and to glorifie him in and for his Mercy.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Yea, the Minor it ſelf is false, if you imply the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive <hi>Only.</hi> For we obtain Righteouſneſs and are juſtified before God effectively by Chriſt as King firſt by conſtitution, and ſecondly, by ſentence, as well as meritoriouſly by Chriſt as Prieſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Blake. <hi>Fifthly, That way that Chriſt took to bring us to God, our faith muſt eye and follow: But Chriſt by death the Sacrifice of of himſelf brings us to God,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.18. <hi>Chriſt alſo hath once ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ſins, the juſt for the unjuſt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Repl.</hi> Still the ſame error: an <hi>Ignoratio Elenchi.</hi> I grant the whole, but the concluſion's wanting. Did I ever deny that <hi>faith muſt eye and follow Chriſts death to bring us to God?</hi> yea for Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. But you ſhould have ſaid <hi>[by his death alone]</hi> or you ſay nothing. And when you prove that by his death alone Chriſt brings us to God, you will do ſomewhat. And yet if you did, it would not follow that we are brought to God in Juſtification only by eying the cauſe of Juſtification as ſuch.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mr. Blake. Sixthly, As Chriſt freeth us from the curſe, ſo he ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies us, and in that notion our faith muſt look to him for Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This is plain; Juſtification being no other but our acquittal from the curſe, which is the ſentence of the Law of</hi> Moſes, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.8. <hi>but Chriſt freeth us from the cauſe in ſuffering as a Sacrifice, not ruling as a Lord,</hi> Gal. 3.13. <hi>Chriſt hath Redeemed us,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Repl.</hi> Firſt <hi>[Only]</hi> is again left out in the Major propoſition, and ſo I grant it: But if it be implyed that <hi>faith muſt look to him for Juſtification only in that notion as he juſtifieth us, yea only as he meriteth Juſtification,</hi> then I deny it, and you ſay nothing to prove it. Secondly, The excluſive of your Minor is a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous error: Chriſt freeth us from the curſe by Juſtifying us as a King, and teaching, and ruling, and ſanctifying us; and not only
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60968:44"/>
by becoming a curſe for us: For if you here put in <hi>[Only]</hi> you plainly exclude all his Obedience as ſuch, and much of it mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially: for it is not a <hi>curſed</hi> thing to obey God. The Law curſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for diſobeying: therefore Obeying is not the Curſe, nor is it materially a Curſe to Love God, and Truſt him, and be zealous for his Glory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The whole office of Chriſt is imployed in freeing us from the Curſe: and when <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, he was made a Curſe to free us, he never ſaid or thought that he did nothing elſe to free us; for an hundred texts do tell us of more.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, And on the by I muſt ſay, that I am not of your mind in the deſcription of Juſtification; for, omitting the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie whether Juſtification only free us from the Curſe, I do not believe that this curſe is only the ſentence of the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> If it were, either you muſt prove that all the Gentile world that heard not of it was under the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> (which abundance of moſt Learned men deny with better grounds then you have to affirm it) or elſe that all theſe are under no curſe for Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to remove. The Law of Nature was materially part of the Moſaical Law; but the form denominateth.</p>
                  <p>So much to Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> Arguments, which are ſo little to the purpoſe, that if the weight of the cauſe, and the prejudice of ſome Readers did not call more earneſtly for a Reply, then any apperance of ſtrength in them, I had ſpared my ſelf and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Labor. But that <hi>[Chriſt as Chriſt is the object of that faith by which as a Condition we muſt be juſtified] and ſo that we are not juſtified only by believing in his blood, but alſo by believing in him entirely as Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, and by becoming his Diſciples, or true Chriſtians,]</hi> this is a truth, that deſerveth more then my Pen to defend it; and that while God affordeth me time and ſtrength, I ſhall never deſert.</p>

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60968:47"/>
againſt the Negative or Affirmative of the Queſtion, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach ſo bitterly thoſe that maintain them, without any diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or explication; as if either the error lay in the terms, or the terms were ſo plain and univocal, that the Propoſitions are true only on one part, what ſenſe ſoever they be taken in. No doubt but he ſaith true, that ſaith that Works are the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Juſtification: and he ſaith as true, that ſaith they are not, if they take the terms in ſuch different ſenſes as commonly Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puters on theſe Queſtions do take them. And its paſt all doubt that [<hi>a man is juſtified by faith without the works of the Law</hi>; and that <hi>it is not of Works, but of Grace</hi>: and its as certain that [<hi>a man is juſtified by works and not by faith only</hi>; and that by <hi>their Words men ſhall be juſtified, and by their Words they ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</hi>] Gods word were not true, if both theſe were not true.</p>
                  <p>We muſt therefore neceſſarily diſtinguiſh: And firſt of Works.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Sometime the term, <hi>Works</hi> is taken for that (in general) which makes the <hi>Reward to be not of Grace but of Debt</hi>: Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious works: Or for ſuch as are conceited to be thus merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, though they be not. And thoſe are materially, either <hi>Works of perfect obedience without ſin,</hi> (ſuch as <hi>Adam</hi> had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his fall, and Chriſt had, and the good Angels have,) or elſe <hi>Works of obedience to the Moſaical Law,</hi> which ſuppoſed ſin, and were uſed in order to pardon and life, but miſtakingly by the blind Unbelievers, as ſuppoſing that the dignity of the Law did put ſuch a dignity on their obedience thereto, as that it would ſerve to life without the ſatisfaction and merit of Chriſt, or at leaſt muſt concur in Co-ordination therewith. Or elſe laſtly, they are Goſpel duties, thus conceited meritorious.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, But ſometime the word <hi>Works</hi> is taken for that which ſtandeth in a due ſubordination to grace: and that firſt, moſt generally, for <hi>any moral virtuous Actions,</hi> and ſo even faith it ſelf is comprehended and even the very Receptive or fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duciall act of faith: or leſs generally, for external acts of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, as diſtinct from internal habitual Grace: and ſo Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, Faith, Love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are not Works: or for all acts ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and internal, except faith it ſelf. And ſo Repentance,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60968:47"/>
Deſire after Chriſt, Love to him, denying our own Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, diſtruſt in our ſelves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are called Works. Or elſe for all Acts external and internal beſides the Reception of Chriſts Righteouſneſs to Juſtification: And ſo the belief of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, the Acceptance of Chriſt as our Prophet and Lord by the Title of Redemption, with many other acts of faith in Chriſt, are called works: beſides the diſclaiming of our own Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and the reſt before mentioned.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As for the word <hi>Juſtification,</hi> it is ſo variouſly taken by Divines, and in common uſe, that it would require more words then I ſhall ſpend on this whole Diſpute, to name and open its ſeveral ſenſes; and therefore (having elſewhere given a brief ſchem of them) I ſhall now only mention theſe few which are moſt pertinent to our purpoſe. Firſt, Some take <hi>Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> for ſome Immanent Acts of God, and ſome for Tranſient. And of the former ſome take it for Gods eternal Decree to juſtifie, which neither Scripture calleth by this name, nor will Reaſon allow us to do it, but improperly. Sometime its taken for Gods Immanent preſent Approbation of a man, and Reputing him to be juſt, when he is firſt ſo conſtituted. And this ſome few call a Tranſient Act, becauſe the Object is extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick: But moſt call it Immanent, becauſe it makes no Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on that object. And ſome plead that this is an eternal act without beginning, becauſe it is Gods eſſence which is eternal; and theſe denominate the Act from the ſubſtance or Agent; And other ſay, that it begins in time, becauſe Gods Eſſence doth then begin to have that Reſpect to a ſinner which makes it capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ſuch a denomination: And ſo theſe ſpeak of the Act de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominatively, formally, reſpectively: Both of them ſpeak true but both ſpeak not the ſame truth.</p>
                  <p>Sometime the word <hi>Juſtification</hi> is taken for a tranſient Act of God that maketh or conduceth to a change upon the extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick object. And ſo firſt, Its ſometime taken by ſome Divines, for a Conditional Juſtification, which is but an act that hath a tendency to that change; and this is not actual Juſtification. Secondly, Sometime it is taken for actual Juſtification, and that is threefold. Firſt, Conſtitutive: Secondly, Sentential: thirdly, executive. Firſt, Conſtitutive Juſtification, is firſt either in the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60968:48"/>
qualities of the ſoul, by inherent holyneſs; which is firſt perfect, ſuch <hi>Adam (once)</hi> and the Angels, and Chriſt had; ſecondly, or Imperfect, ſuch as the ſanctified here have. Secondly, Or its in our Relations: when we are pardoned and receive our Right to Glory: This is an act of God in Chriſt by the free Gift of the Goſpel, or Law of Grace: and it is firſt, The firſt put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a ſinner into a ſtate of Righteouſneſs, out of a ſtate of Guilt. Secondly, Or it is the continuing him in that ſtate, and the renewing of particular pardon upon particular ſins. Secondly, Sentential pardon or Juſtification, is, firſt, by that Manifeſtation which God makes before the Angels in heaven. Secondly, at the day of Judgement before all the world. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Executive Juſtification, <hi>viz.</hi> the execution of the aforeſaid ſentence, (leſs properly called Juſtification, and more properly called pardon) conſiſteth in taking off the puniſhment inflicted, and forbearing the puniſhment deſerved, and giving poſſeſſion of the happineſs adjudged us: ſo that it is partly in this life, <hi>viz.</hi> in giving the ſpirit, and outward mercies, and freeing us from judgements (And thus ſanctification it ſelf is a part of Juſtification) and partly in the life to come, in freeing us from Hell, and poſſeſſing us of Glory.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, As for the word <hi>Condition,</hi> the Etymologiſts will tell us, that it firſt ſignifieth <hi>Actionem condendi:</hi> and then, <hi>Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem, qua quid conditur,</hi> and then <hi>qualitatem ipſam per quam con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere aliguis, vel condi aliquid poteſt; &amp; hinc eſt pro ſtatu qui fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus eſt rem condendo; &amp; deinceps pro omni ſtatu, quem perſona vel res aut cauſa quoquo modo habet aut accipit.</hi> But we have nothing to do with it in ſuch large acceptions, in which all things in the world may be called Conditions. <hi>Vid. Martin. in Nom.</hi> They come nearer our uſe of the word, when they expound it by, <hi>Moderatio, Circumſcriptio, determinatio, limitatio.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Many other acceptions of the word in Phyſicks by <hi>Zabarel, Claudius Alberius</hi> and others; you may ſee in <hi>Goclenii Lexic. Philoſoph. in nom. conditio.</hi> But we are not in a Phyſical, but a moral diſcourſe, and therfore muſt be underſtood according to the ſubject matter. It is therfore a Civil or Legal Condition that we have to enquire <hi>after,</hi> and muſt fetch our deſcriptions from Lawyers, and not from Phyſicks, and therefore it is but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful equivocation in ſome Opponents, to fetch their oppoſition from Phyſical inſtances.</p>
                  <p>The Lawyers give us divers Definitions of Condition, but for the moſt part they come all to one in ſenſe. Some ſay, <hi>conditio eſt Lex adpoſita hominum actionibus, eas ſuſpendens,</hi> Prat. <hi>Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio</hi> (ſay others) <hi>eſt modus qui ſuſpendit actum, donec co exiſtente confirmetur.

They are commonly divided into <hi>Caſuaeles, Poteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivas, &amp; mixtas.</hi> The moral operation of Conditions as ſuch, is not in cauſing the effect when performed, but in ſuſpending the effect till performed. The reaſon of the appointing of them for ſuch ſuſpenſions is various: ſometime its becauſe the perſon Giving, promiſing, or otherwiſe conſtituting the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is uncertain of the event of the performance, and would not have the effect come to paſs without it. But thats not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies: ſometime though he might be ſure of the event of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, yet if he that is to perform the Condition be uncertain, it may make way for this conſtitution. It is therefore a vain Plea of them that ſay, God appointeth no conditions of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60968:49"/>
becauſe the event is not to him uncertain. Saith <hi>Mat. Martin in nom. Cond. Defimri ſolet Diſpoſitionis ſuſpenſio ex eventu incerto futuro ei oppoſito.

                  <p>The firſt cauſe of the Condition, is the Requirer, whether he be Teſtator, Donor, Stipulator, Legiſlator, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſo the Condition of the Law or Covenant of Grace, is firſt, <hi>Gods</hi> condition <hi>as the Impoſer.</hi> Secondly, And its the condition of each <hi>Subject</hi> as <hi>obliged</hi> to perform it. Thirdly, And the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of each <hi>profeſſing Chriſtian</hi> as having <hi>Promiſed</hi> the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance. Fourthly, And the condition of <hi>true Chriſtians</hi> only as <hi>actual Performers</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p>The condition of the Goſpel hath ſeveral reſpects according to the various reſpects of the Law that doth impoſe it. Its the <hi>Condition of a free Gift</hi>; for the Goſpel is a free Gift of Chriſt and Life: It is the <hi>Condition of a Promiſe</hi>; becauſe much of the Goſpel benefits are future. It is the <hi>Condition of a Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> becauſe Chriſt dying did leave this to the Church as his laſt Will, and it was confirmed by the death of the Teſtator. It is the <hi>Condition of a premiant Law,</hi> and Act of Grace and oblivion; becauſe God made it as Legiſlator and Rector of the world in order to the conducting of his people to their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſ: It is the condition <hi>of a Minatory Law,</hi> in that it is a duty commanded on pain of death and for the avoiding of that death.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The prepoſition <hi>[by]</hi> in our preſent queſtion, may ſignifie, either the uſe and Intereſt of any Medium in General; or elſe of a true <hi>cauſe</hi> conſtitutive or efficient. So much of the terms.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:60968:49"/>
                     <hi>Propoſition</hi> 1. Since <hi>Adams</hi> fall, it is impoſſible for man to be juſtified by a perfect ſinleſs Obedience of his own, (except Chriſt only:) and conſequently impoſſible for him to be juſtified by the Law conſidered in that form and tenor as it was given to <hi>Adam</hi>: for all men are ſinners; and that Law will uſtifie no ſinner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Propoſition</hi> 2. By the works of the Moſaical Law, no man can be juſtified. And therefore the Jews ſeek Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs where it is not to be found, while they think that pardon of ſin and acceptance with God are to be obtained by the bare works of that Law: while they overlook or reject Chriſt who is the end of that Law for righteouſneſs to every Believer Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally now that Law is Abrogated or ceaſed, it were a double error to expect Juſtification by its works.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Propoſition</hi> 3. Much leſs can they be juſtified by the foreſaid Law, who in ſtead of fulfilling it, do but falſely imagine that they fulfill it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Propoſition</hi> 4. No man can be juſtified by works properly meritorious, becauſe no man hath any ſuch at all; nor may we once imagine that we have any ſuch works as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of (and the Jews thought they had) which make the reward to be not of Grace but of Debt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.4. much leſs that we are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by ſuch; even Goſpel works and faith it ſelf do not juſtifie on this account, and a conceit that they are thus meritorious would but turn them into condemning ſins.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Propoſition</hi> 5. No act of mans, no not faith it ſelf can ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie as an act or work, nor as <hi>This act in ſpecie</hi> that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the neareſt and formal reaſon of its juſtifying Intereſt <hi>muſt</hi> not be fetcht either from the General or ſpecial nature of the act it ſelf: and therefore it is not faith as faith, that is, as it is an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of Chriſt or recumbency on him, that Juſtifyeth: nor yet as an Inſtrument thus acting. The nature of the act is but its aptitude to its office or juſtifying Intereſt, and not the formal cauſe of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Propoſition</hi> 6. No work or act of man is any true proper cauſe of his juſtification, (as Juſtification is commonly taken in the Goſpel:) neither Principal or Inſtrumental. The higheſt Intereſt that they can have, is but to be a condition of our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60968:50"/>
and ſo a <hi>Diſpoſitio moralis,</hi> which therefore ſome call <hi>canſa diſpoſitiva,</hi> and ſome <hi>cauſa ſine qua non,</hi> and its indeed but a <hi>Nominall cauſe,</hi> and truly no <hi>cauſe</hi> at all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Propoſition</hi> 7. Whatſoever works do ſtand in <hi>oppoſition</hi> to Chriſt, or <hi>diſjunct</hi> from him, yea or that ſtand <hi>not in a due ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> to him, are ſo far from Juſtifying even as conditions, that they are ſins which do deſerve condemnation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Propoſition</hi> 8. Works, as taken for the Imperate Acts of Obedience external, diſtinct from the firſt Radical Graces, are not ſo much as conditions of our Juſtification as begun, or our being put into a Juſtified ſtate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Propoſition</hi> 9. Repentance from dead works, denying our our ſelves, renouncing our own Righteouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (much leſs external Obedience) are not the receptive condition of our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, as faith is, that is, <hi>Their</hi> nature is not to be an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Acceptance of Chriſt that is, they are not faith and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are not deſigned on that account to be the Condition of our Juſtification.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Propoſition</hi> 10. God doth not juſtifie us by Imputing our own faith to us in ſtead of perfect Obedience to the Law, as if it were ſufficient, or eſteemed by him ſufficient to ſupply its place; For it is Chriſts Righteouſneſs that in point of value and merit doth ſupply its place: nor doth any work of ours juſtifie us by ſatisfying for our ſins: for thats the work of Chriſt the Mediator: Our faith and love and obedience, which are for the receiving and improving of him and his Righteouſneſs and ſo ſtand in full ſubordination to him, are not to be made co-part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of his office or honor.</p>
                  <p>Affirm. <hi>Propoſition</hi> firſt. We are juſtified by the merits of a perfect ſinleſs Obedience of Chriſt (together with his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings) which he performed both to the Law of nature, the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Law which was proper to himſelf as Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, as the ſubject obliged.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Propoſition</hi> 2. There is ſomewhat in the nature of faith it ſelf <hi>in ſpecie,</hi> which makes it fit to be <hi>elected and appointed</hi> by God to be the great <hi>ſummary Condition</hi> of the Goſpel; that it be <hi>Receptive</hi> (an Acceptance of Chriſt) is the nature of the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60968:50"/>
thing: but that it be a condition of our Juſtification, is from the will and conſtitution of the Donor and Juſtifier.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Propoſition</hi> 3. There is alſo ſomewhat in the nature of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, ſelf-denyal, renouncing all other Saviours, and our own righteouſneſs, deſiring Chriſt, loving Chriſt, intending God and Glory as our end, (procured by Chriſt,) confeſſing ſin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which make them apt to be <hi>Diſpoſitive Conditions,</hi> and ſo to be comprized or implyed in faith the ſummary Receptive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as its neceſſary attendants at leaſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Propoſition</hi> 4. Accordingly God hath joyned theſe together in his Promiſe and conſtitution, making faith the <hi>ſummary and receptive Condition,</hi> and making the ſaid acts of Repentance, ſelf-denyal renouncing our own righteouſneſs &amp; diſclaiming in heart Juſtification by the works of the Law, and the renouncing of all other Saviours, alſo the deſiring and loving of Chriſt offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the willing of God as our God, and the renouncing of all other Gods and ſo of the world, fleſh and devil; at leaſt in the reſolution of the heart; I ſay making theſe the <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitive Conditions,</hi> which are ever implyed when faith only is expreſſed, ſome of them as ſubſervient to faith, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſome of them as real parts of faith it ſelf. (Of which more anon.)</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Propoſition</hi> 5. The Goſpel promiſeth Juſtification to all that will <hi>Believe,</hi> (or are <hi>Believers.</hi>) To be a <hi>Believer</hi> and to be a <hi>Diſciple</hi> of Chriſt, in Scripture ſenſe is all one, and ſo is it to be a <hi>Diſciple</hi> and to be a Chriſtian: therefore the ſenſe of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is, that we ſhall be juſtified, if we become true <hi>Chriſtians</hi> or <hi>Diſciples</hi> of Chriſt; and therefore juſtifying faith compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth all that is eſſential to our Diſciple<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſhip or Chriſtianity as its conſtitutive cauſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Propoſition</hi> 6. It is not therefore any one ſingle Act of faith alone by which we are juſtified, but it is many Phyſical acts conjunctly which conſtitute that faith which the Goſpel makes the condition of Life. Thoſe therefore that call any one Act or two by the name of juſtifying faith, and all the reſt by the name of works, and ſay that it is only the act of recumbency on Chriſt as Prieſt, or on Chriſt as dying for us, or only the act of apprehending or accepting his imputed Righteouſneſs, by

which we are juſtified, and that our Aſſent, or Acceptance of him as our Teacher and Lord, our deſire of him, our love to him, our renouncing other Saviours and our own Righteouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are the works which <hi>Paul</hi> doth exclude from our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and that it is Jewiſh to expect to be juſtified by theſe though but as Conditions of Juſtification; theſe perſons do miſtake <hi>Paul,</hi> and pervert the Doctrine of Faith and Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and their Doctrine tendeth to corrupt the very nature of Chriſtianity it ſelf.

                     <hi>Propoſition</hi> 7. Sincere obedience to God in Chriſt is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our continuance in a ſtate of Juſtification, or of our not loſing it.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Propoſition</hi> 8. Our Faith, Love, and Works of Love, or ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Obedience, are conditions of our ſentential Juſtification by Chriſt at the particular and general Judgement (which is the great Juſtification.) And ſo as they will prove our Intereſt in Chriſt our Righteouſneſs, ſo will they materially themſelves juſtifie us againſt the particular falſe Accuſation of being fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally impenitent, Unbelievers, not Loving, not obeying ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely. For to deny a falſe accuſation is ſufficient to our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Propoſition</hi> 9. As Glorification and Deliverance from Hell, is by ſome called Executive pardon or Juſtification; ſo the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid acts are conditions of that execution, which are conditions of Juſtification by the ſentence of the Judge.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Propoſition.</hi> 10. As to a real inherent Juſtice, or Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in this life we have it in part (in our Sanctification and Obedience) and in the life to come we ſhall have it in perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                        <pb n="79" facs="tcp:60968:51"/>I Come now to prove the ſum of the Affirmative Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, together ſo far as they reſolve the Queſtion in hand, <hi>viz.</hi> that works or acts of man have ſuch an Intereſt in our Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and are ſo far conditions as is here aſſerted.</p>
                     <p>My firſt proof is from thoſe Texts of Scripture which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſpeak of Juſtification by ſuch acts or works.</p>
                     <p>If we are juſtified <hi>By</hi> our words and works, then are they no leſs then conditions of Juſtification. But we are juſtified <hi>By</hi> them. <hi>Ergo.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The Conſequence of the Major is plain, firſt, In that the Prepoſition <hi>[By]</hi> doth ſignifie no leſs then the Intereſt of ſome means: but theſe Works can be no means, but either a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or a cauſe, which is more: A cauſe, the perſons that now I deal with, will not affirm them to be: If they do, then they aſcribe much more to them then to be a condition. Secondly, The Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of faith it ſelf is expreſſed by no higher terms then <hi>[By,]</hi> that is, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <p>The Minor is expreſs, 1. <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.36, 37. <hi>[For by thy words thou ſhalt be juſtified, and by thy words thou ſhalt be condemned].</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>) This ſpeaks of Juſtification in this life.</p>
                     <p>When men argue againſt Juſtification by our <hi>words</hi> or <hi>works,</hi> I deſire 1. to underſtand whether it be the <hi>words</hi> or the <hi>ſenſe</hi> that they argue againſt. If the <hi>words,</hi> then it is either againſt the uſe of them <hi>ſimply,</hi> as being falſe or unmeet: or elſe againſt <hi>unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> uſe of them. For the former they have no ground; for you ſee it is the expreſs language of Chriſt himſelf and his Apoſtle. And as to the later, I eaſily grant that no Scripture phraſe ſhould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonably uſed. But if it be not the words but the ſenſe that they blame, why then do they harp ſo much on the words themſelves, and raiſe the moſt of the odium from thence? And
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:60968:52"/>
what is the unwarrantable ſenſe? I know not of any lower ſenſe that they can put on theſe words, then what importeth the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of a condition: As for that of <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. they ſay little to it. And as to that of <hi>James,</hi> they interpret it differently among themſelves. Firſt, Some of them ſay that <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks of Juſtification before men, and others ſay he ſpeaks of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before God. The former are eaſily confuted (as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the text to that alone) by the expreſs words of the Text. For, firſt, <hi>ver.</hi> 23. it expreſly ſpeaks of Righteouſneſs by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Imputation, and of Gods accepting <hi>Abraham</hi> into friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Secondly, The text ſpeaks of that Juſtification which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curreth with Salvation, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. [<hi>can faith ſave him</hi>?] Thirdly, It ſpeaks of the Death of faith without works, as to <hi>Profiting,</hi> ver. 16.17. which is different from <hi>manifeſtation.</hi> Fourthly, It inſtanceth in the ſecret act of <hi>Rahab,</hi> and ſuch an act of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> as we read of no men that then juſtified him for, nay they were liker to condemn him. Fifthly, Men may juſtifie an Hypocrite as ſoon as the truly godly, and can but conjecture at the faith by the works. But the ſcope of the text ſhews that it is no ſuch frivolous juſtification that is here meant.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, They that ſay that it is juſtification before God that is here meant, (as no doubt it is) have yet divers interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the word <hi>Works.</hi> Some ſay, that by <hi>Works</hi> is not meant <hi>[Works themſelves]</hi> indeed, but a <hi>working</hi> faith. To them I ſay, firſt, I deny it, and wait for better proof then is yet brought. Secondly, The text nameth <hi>[works]</hi> expreſly twelve times in a few verſes: which is not uſual in ſpeeches ſo tropi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call as this is ſuppoſed to be. Thirdly, In many or moſt of the texts, that interpretation would make the words non-ſenſe, as the peruſall will declare. Fourthly, If the word <hi>[works]</hi> did emphatically ſignifie the <hi>[working nature]</hi> of faith, or faith not <hi>qua fides,</hi> but <hi>qua operans,</hi> it will be all one as to the matter in queſtion, and yield what I deſire.</p>
                     <p>Others ſay that by <hi>works</hi> is indeed meant the <hi>works themſelves</hi> properly; but then they ſay that the text ſpeaks not of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification of the perſon by them, but of faith by them, for faith, ſay they, alone doth juſtifie the perſon, and works only juſtifie faith. Anſwer, But firſt, this contradicteth the expreſs text: for
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:60968:52"/>
                        <hi>verſe</hi> 14. It is the Salvation of the perſon that is denyed; and <hi>ver.</hi> 21. It it the juſtification of <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf that is there mentioned; and <hi>ver.</hi> 24. it is the <hi>man</hi> that is ſaid to be <hi>juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by works and not by faith only</hi>; and <hi>verſe</hi> 25. it is <hi>Rahab</hi> her ſelf that is ſaid to be <hi>juſtified by works.</hi> Secondly, The anſwer contradicteth themſelves, or granteth what I deſire: for if works juſtifie the faith, they muſt needs juſtifie the perſon <hi>in tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> againſt any accuſation of groſs Infidelity and Hypocriſie. Sometime the perſon is juſtified when his Action cannot be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied (as in caſe of ſatisfaction and pardon:) but to juſtifie the action it ſelf, is the higheſt ſort of juſtifying the perſon.</p>
                     <p>So that all other Interpretations being either overthrown, or reſolved into that which we maintain, I need to ſay to more for the defending of it.</p>
                     <p>My next proof is from thoſe texts that ſay, we ſhall be <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to our works, and rewarded according to our Labour,</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.9, 10. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.8. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.16, 17. <hi>Matthew</hi> 16.27. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If men ſhall be juſtified <hi>according</hi> to their works, then thoſe works are no lower then a condition of that juſtification: But the Antecedent is true, as I prove thus. If men ſhall be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to their works, therefore they ſhall be <hi>juſtified</hi> according to their works: The reaſon of the Conſequence is evident; becauſe <hi>judging</hi> is the <hi>Genus,</hi> which comprehendeth Juſtification and condemnation as its <hi>ſpecies.</hi> The reaſon alſo of the conſequence of the former Argument is apparent: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the term <hi>[of judging according to works]</hi> doth in the common uſe of men ſignifie ordinarily that which they call the <hi>Meritum cauſae,</hi> but never any thing lower then a bare conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: nor can any lower tolerable judiciary ſenſe be put upon them, as might eaſily be ſhewed if it were worth the ſtanding on.</p>
                     <p>My next proof is from thoſe texts that expreſly promiſe the pardon of ſin on condition of Repentance, Confeſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If Repentance, and other acts are made by the Goſpel, conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of pardon, (and our firſt general Pardon) then are they made conditions of our firſt admiſſion into a ſtate of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But the Antecedent is plain, in <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38. <hi>Mar.</hi> 14.
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60968:53"/>
                        <hi>Luke</hi> 13.35. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.67. and 1.16, 17, 18. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.11, 16. and 18.28, 29, 30, 31, 32. <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.13. <hi>Act.</hi> 3.19. with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more. The Conſequence is plain, in that <hi>Pardon</hi> is by very many made the whole of our Juſtification; and by others confeſſed a chief part; and by all its confeſſed to be made ours on the ſame terms as is Juſtification it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>My fourth Proof is from thoſe texts which make theſe kind of Acts to have the place of a condition in order to <hi>ſalvation</hi>; if they are conditions of ſalvation, then are they no leſs then conditions of our final Juſtification: But the Antecedent is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily acknowledged by the Opponents, and its proved, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.18, 19. <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.28. and 13.24 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.24, 25, 26, 27. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.14. <hi>John</hi> 12.26. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.20. <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.29. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.1, 2, 4, 6. and 5.12, 46. and 10.41, 42. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.5, 6. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.23, 24. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.10. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.7, 8. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.6, 9. <hi>John</hi> 5.22, 27, 28, 29, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Conſequence is proved good, firſt, In that final Juſtification and Glorification have the ſame conditions; as is plain, both in many Scriptures <hi>(mentioned)</hi> and in the nature of the thing: for that Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is the adjudging us to that Glory; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo far as any thing is the cauſe or condition of the Glory it ſelf, it muſt be the reaſon of the ſentence which <hi>adjudgeth</hi> it to us. Secondly, And ſalvation is as free as Juſtification, and no more deſerved by man: and therefore the Apoſtle equally excludeth works from both, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.5, 8, 9. <hi>By Grace ye are ſaved, through faith, and that not of your ſelves, it is the gift of God; not of worke, leſt any man ſhould boaſt.</hi> ſo <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5, 6, 7. more fully. Now if <hi>Salvation by grace through faith without works,</hi> exclude not ſincere obedience from being a Condition of <hi>Salvation,</hi> then <hi>Juſtification by grace through faith without works,</hi> doth not (in Scripture ſence) exclude ſincere obedience from being the condition of our <hi>final Juſtification,</hi> nor Repentance from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the condition of our <hi>juſtification as begun</hi>: (for there is <hi>ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem ratio,</hi> and the Text makes the one as free without works, as the other) But the Antecedent is plain in the Scriptures, <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>My fifth Proof is from thoſe texts that in terms ſeem to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:60968:53"/>
a <hi>cauſality</hi> to ſuch obediential acts, which can be interpreted of no leſs then a <hi>conditionality</hi>; ſuch are <hi>Luke</hi> 19.17. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.31, 23, 34, 35, 40, 46. <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.16, 17, 18. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34.26, 27. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 91.9, 14. <hi>Mark</hi> 7.29. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.22, 23. <hi>John</hi> 16.27. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.10. and 3.4. and 7.14, 15. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And though ſome of theſe texts ſpeak not of Divine acceptance to life; yet firſt, ſome do; ſecondly, and the reſt ſpeak of no mercy but what is as freely given as <hi>Juſtification.</hi> A mans own works are exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded other Means and parts of ſalvation, as well as that.</p>
                     <p>I run over theſe briefly and generally, both becauſe I expect that the bare texts without my Comments, ſhould work upon the Conſiderate, and becauſe I have been ſo much upon it former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in other writings (as Confeſs. §. 3. <hi>p.</hi> 
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But the chief thing that I further here intend, is to anſwer ſome Objections, that by a Reverend Brother in his ſecond part of his Treatiſe of Juſtification are brought againſt me.</p>
                     <p>But before I come to his Arguments, its neceſſary that I a little animadvert on his Deſcription of Juſtification, that we may firſt agree upon the ſenſe of our terms, or at leaſt, know how to underſtand one another.</p>
                     <p>Treat. <hi>Of Juſtification. p.</hi> 126. [<hi>Juſtification is a gratious and juſt Act of God, whereby through Chriſt our Mediator and Surety, a ſinner, but repenting and believing, is pronounced juſt, and hereby put into a ſtate of Reconciliation and favour with God, to the praiſe of Gods glorious attributes, and to the Believers eternal ſalvation. I ſhall not examine this Deſcription by accurate Logical Rules,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, Doubtleſs an accurate, rather then popular definition would as ſoon be expected from you, as from moſt; and here as anywhere in a Treatiſe purpoſely on the Subject.

are made righteous by the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi>; which if not meant of inherent holineſs doth imply that the righteouſneſs we have by Chriſt, is not meerly declarative, but alſo conſtitutive; and indeed, one is in order before the other; for a man muſt be righteous, before he can be pronounced or declared ſo to be.]</p>
                     <p>Treat. <hi>p. The Application of (Juſtification) is attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> I know not of any ſuch, except firſt, where Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification is taken for Sanctification. Secondly, or as the Holy Ghoſt is made the Author of the Promiſe, though I doubt not but he is the Author of faith alſo.</p>
                     <p>Treat. 16. <hi>The</hi> Socinians <hi>ſay Chriſt juſtifieth only In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentally, not principally; even ſo faith is ſaid to ſave: but this cannot be, becauſe Chriſt is God as well at Man, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be inſtrumental, but principal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> As they err on one hand, that ſay Chriſt juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>only</hi> Inſtrumentally (which flows from their blaſphemous denyall of his God-head) ſo its an error on the other hand, to ſay that Chriſt cannot be Inſtrumental, but principal; I prove the contrary; firſt, If Chriſt may be an Officer appointed by the Father to the Redemption, and ruling of mankind, then may he be an Inſtrument. But, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Ergo, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, If Chriſt may be a means, he may be an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but he may be a means, for he is called by himſelf the way to the Father: and a way is a means.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, He is called the Fathers ſervant: therefore he may be an Inſtrument.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, He is ſaid to come to do his Fathers will, therefore he is his Inſtrument.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, All <hi>Power</hi> is ſaid to be given him, even the Power of judging, <hi>John</hi> 5.22. and <hi>Matthew</hi> 28.18, 19. therefore he is the Fathers Inſtrument in judging.</p>
                     <p>And your reaſon is invalid, (<hi>viz.</hi> becauſe Chriſt is God) for he is Man as well as God, and ſo may be Inſtrumental.</p>

                        <pb n="85" facs="tcp:60968:54"/>Treat. <hi>p.</hi> 129, 130. <hi>It ſounds as intolerable Doctrine in my ears, that Chriſt our Mediator did only expiate by his death ſins againſt the Law and Covenant of works, but that thoſe that are againſt the Covenant of Grace,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> A ſin is againſt the Law of Grace or Goſpel, firſt, becauſe it is againſt ſome object revealed in the Goſpel, which the ſin is againſt, (as Chriſt) Thus ſin was expiated by Chriſt: 2ly. As it is againſt a Precept of the Goſpel and thus it is expiated by Chriſt: 3ly. As it is a breach of a mans own Promiſe or Covenant made to Chriſt upon the Goſpel invitation. And thus it is expiated by Chriſt. 4ly. Or as it hath reſpect to the Goſpel commination, ſo as to make a man the object of the actuall curſe of this New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, or the perſon to whom its proper penalty is become actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally due; as every ſin made the penalty of the firſt Law actually due to us. This is it that I have ſaid, that Chriſt doth not expiate, and none but this. Some Divines ſay, the Goſpel hath no proper curſe or commination &amp; penalty.

And if after all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, you will ſtill carry it in confuſion, or intimate that men hold intolerable Doctrine, omitting their explications, and by generals making that theirs which they diſclaim: our next reply ſhall be patience; or if you think indeed, either that the Law of Grace doth oblige any under the penalty of reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dileſs non-liberation, beſides the finally Impenitent and Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, or that Chriſt dyed to expiate any mans predominant final Impenitency or Unbelief, I will not trouble you with any other conſutation then a denyal of it.</p>

                        <hi>Anſwer.</hi> The Word <hi>Ingredient</hi> is more ambiguous then to be worthy the labour of diſcuſſing: But your aſſigned difference I ever did allow. And yet muſt we voluminouſly differ, when I have told you that I allow it? But then I add, that this difference is in the nature of the acts, and in their aptitude to their office. But in the general nature of <hi>being Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of pardon,</hi> which is the neareſt reaſon of their intereſt, they agree, though upon ſeveral reaſons they are made conditions.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſwer.</hi> I ſaid ſo too in my Aphoriſms. But the reaſons of a learned man (Dr. <hi>Wallis</hi> in his friendly animadverſions) have perſwaded me that it is unſound.</p>
                     <p>Treat. <hi>p.</hi> 129. <hi>It is aſſerted, that Juſtification called</hi> in Titulo, <hi>or virtual, is nothing but the Grant of it in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: But I ſee not how that can be called our Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, That which is aſſerted, is, firſt, That the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, is the Inſtrument juſtifying. Secondly, That the moral act of the Goſpel-Grant (and Gods Will by it) is Juſtification <hi>in ſenſu activo.</hi> Thirdly, That the Relation reſulting there-from, is our paſſive Juſtification.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Can you ſee how a Princes pardon under his hand-writing can be the Inſtrument of a Traitors pardon; and how the moral or civil Action of that Inſtrument, and of the Prince by it, can be active pardon; and how the Relation effected by it can be paſſive pardon? If you can ſee it there, you may ſee it here: And if you cannot, many a one can.</p>
                     <p>Treat. <hi>It is the ſign or Inſtrument declaring it: not juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation it ſelf.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>An.</hi> Who ever ſaid, and where, that paſſive Juſtification (yea or
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:60968:55"/>
active) is the Goſpel it ſelf, or the ſign? The Letter is the ſign; The actual ſignification of Gods will thereby is the juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying act. The Relation thence reſulting on us, is our paſſive Juſtification. Theſe have been oft recited.</p>
                     <p>Treat. <hi>As the grant or promiſe of our Sanctification is not our Sanctification.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Good reaſon: The difference is not to you unknown: Sanctification (paſsive) being a Phyſical effect, muſt have a Phyſical cauſe, and therefore a bare moral cauſe cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it. But pardon or juſtification being but a Relative effect, may be produced <hi>per nudam reſultantiam à fundamento.</hi> 2. But ſuppoſe God had made a promiſe of Sanctification on condition of faith; would not the <hi>Right</hi> to Sanctification have reſulted immediately from this promiſe, the condition being performed? And that <hi>Right</hi> hath the ſame Relative nature, as conſtitutive Juſtification, and pardon it ſelf hath.</p>
                     <p>Treat. <hi>And as on the contrary our condemnation while we abide in ſin, or Gods anger againſt the ſinner, is not the threatning promulged, but that which comes from God himſelf.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Our Condemnation <hi>per ſententiam Judicis,</hi> is not the thing in queſtion, not yet the explication of it; but our conſtitutive condemnation. And that it is not indeed the Letter of the Law, (whoever ſaid ſo) but <hi>activè,</hi> it is the action of the Law, <hi>&amp; paſſivè ſumpta,</hi> it is the Relative effect of the Law.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. From your own Argument reverſt, I unreſiſtibly make good my Cauſe againſt you. Condemnation active is the Laws act, and condemnation Paſsive is the Laws immediate effect: therefore Juſtification is alike produced by the Promiſe or Gift in the Goſpel. The Antecedent is proved, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.18. <hi>he that believeth on him, is not condemned,</hi> (for the Obligation is diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) <hi>but he that believeth not, is condemned already.</hi>] Which muſt be by ſome Law, it being before Judgement and Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3 9. The Law in its delivery is called [the miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

And ſaith, <hi>Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Law ſaith, it ſaith to them that are under the Law] Rom.</hi> 3.19. When the <hi>Law comes, ſin reviveth, and we die, Rom.</hi> 7.8 9. therefore we are ſaid to be <hi>[delivered from the Law,] Rom.</hi> 8.2. <hi>&amp; Gal.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.6. And <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.21. <hi>If there had been a Law given which could have given life, righteouſneſs ſhould have been by the Law.</hi> Hence then is mention of being <hi>Iuſtified by the Law, Gal.</hi> 5.4. and mens being <hi>debtors to the Law, Gal.</hi> 5.3. And ſomewhat this way is implyed by <hi>Nicodemus, Iohn</hi> 7.51. <hi>doth our Law judge any man before, &amp;c.</hi>] In a word, what more common among Divines, then to ſay, <hi>[the Law curſeth or condemneth ſinners]</hi> And then it is not abhorrent from the nature of a Law of Grace, an act of Oblivion, to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve and juſtifie ſinners.</p>
                     <p>Treat. <hi>Neither then could we ſay, that we are juſtified by Chriſt given to us, but by the propoſition laid down in the Scripture, whereas all ſay that the</hi> objectum quod <hi>of our faith is</hi> ens incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexum, <hi>not the promiſe of Chriſt, but Chriſt himſelf pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Its no impoſsible thing to be juſtified both by Chriſt, and by the Promiſe. There is no ground to ſuppoſe co-ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates to be contraries. Why may not Chriſt given us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> juſtifie us as the meritorious cauſe, and a principal efficient; and his Goſpel-grant, as his Inſtrument? And accordingly each of them may be the object of faith. The principal object is an <hi>ens incomplexum,</hi> Chriſt himſelf: but a ſubordinat Object is both the Doctrine Revealing what he is and hath done, and the promiſe which offereth him to us, and telleth us what he will do. If a Princes Son redeem a woman from Captivity, or the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, and cauſe an Inſtrument under his own hand (and the Kings) to be ſent to her, aſſuring her of pardon, and liberty,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60968:56"/>
and honours with himſelf, if ſhe will take him for her husband, and truſt him for the accompliſhment? Is it not poſsible for this woman to be pardoned and delivered by the King, by the Princes ranſom, by the Prince eſpouſed, and by her marriage with him and by the Inſtrument of pardon or conveyance? You may be enriched by a Deed of Gift and yet it may be an <hi>ens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complexum</hi> that is beſtowed on you by that Deed, and enricheth you too. Your Money and your Leaſe, both may give you title to your houſe. The promiſe is Gods Deed of Gift, beſtowing on us Chriſt and pardon, or Juſtification with him.</p>
                     <p>Treat. <hi>Beſides,</hi> Abraham <hi>was Iuſtified, and he is made the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of all that ſhall be Iuſtified: Yet there was no Scripture-grant, or deed of gift in writing, declaring this: God then commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating himſelf to Belivers in an immediate manner.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Was there no Goſpel-grant then extant? no deed of Gift of Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs to all that ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve? Nothing to aſſure men of Juſtification by faith, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate communications to Believers? If ſo, then either there was no Church, and no ſalvation: or a Church and ſalvation without faith in Chriſt: and either faith in the Meſſiah to come for pardon and life, was a duty, or no duty: If no duty, then — If a duty, then there was a Law enjoyning it, and that Law muſt needs contain or be conjunct with a revelation of Chriſt, and pardon and life to be had by him. I ſuppoſe that whatever was the ſtanding way of Life and Juſtification then to the Church, had a ſtanding precept and promiſe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage to the duty and ſecure the benefit. I know not of duty without Precept, nor of faith without a word to be believed. But this word was not written! True! but what of that? Was it ever the leſs a Law or Promiſe, the Object of Faith, or Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Juſtification? The promiſe of the ſeed might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed by Tradition, and doubtleſs was ſo. Or if there had been no general conditional grant or offer of pardon through Chriſt in thoſe times, but only particular communications to ſome men, yet would thoſe have been nevertheleſs inſtrumental</p>

                        <pb n="90" facs="tcp:60968:57"/>Treat. <hi>Therefore to call this Grant or Conditional Promiſe in the Scripture,</hi> Whoſoever ſhall believe ſhall be juſtified, <hi>a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient act of God, is very unproper, unleſs in ſuch a ſenſe, as we ſay, ſuch a mans writing is his hand, and that is wholly impertinent to our purpoſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> There are two diſtinct acts of God here that I call Tranſient. The firſt is the Enacting of this Law, or giving this promiſe. If this were not Gods act, then it is not his Law or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. If it be his act, it is either Tranſient, or Immanent. I have not been accuſtomed to believe that Legiſlation, Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are no acts, or are Immanent acts. The ſecond is the continued Moral Action of the Word, which is alſo Gods Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by that Word as his Inſtrument: As it is the Action of a written Pardon to Acquit, and of a Leaſe to give Title, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſo the Law is ſaid to abſolve, condemn, command, <hi>&amp;c. What it ſaith, it ſaith to them that are under the Law:</hi> And to ſay, is to Act. Though phyſically this is no other Action, then a ſign performeth in ſignifying, or a <hi>fundamentum</hi> in producing the Relation, which is called the neareſt efficient of that Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now either you think that to <hi>oblige</hi> (the moſt eſſential act of Laws) to <hi>abſolve, condemn,</hi> &amp;c. are Gods acts by his Word, or not. If not, the miſtake is ſuch as I dare not confute, for fear leaſt by opening the greatneſs of it, I offend you. If yea; then either it is Gods Immanent act, or his Tranſient. The former I never to this day heard or read any man affirm it to be. That which is done by an Inſtrument, is no Immanent act in God: To oblige to duty, to give right to Impunity and Salvation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are done by Inſtruments, <hi>viz.</hi> the Word of God, as it is the ſignifier of his will: therefore they are not Immanent Acts. Moreover, that which is begun in time, and is not from Eternity, is no Immanent Act. But ſuch are the fore-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: becauſe the word which is the Inſtrument, was indited in time. Laſtly, that which maketh a change on the extrinſick ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is no Immanent act, but ſuch are theſe Moral acts of the Word: for they change our Relations, and give us a Right which we had not before, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore they are certainly tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:60968:57"/>
acts. A thing that I once thought I ſhould never by man have been put to prove.</p>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> And I deſire you to obſerve, that if it be no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour to Chriſt, that we be there (through his grace) ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly juſtified without his Imputed righteouſneſs, or pardon, or faith <hi>pro futuro,</hi> it cannot be any diſhonour to him here, that we ſhould repent, and believe, and be ſanctified, nor that thoſe ſhould be conditions of further mercy, and ſufficient of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to juſtifie us againſt any falſe charge that we are Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent unſanctified Infidels. If a perfect cure diſgrace not our Phyſitian then ſure an imperfect cure and the acknowledgement of it, is no diſhonour to our Phyſitian now.</p>

If I had not, yet you yield me what I deſire: If faith act not, but ſuffer, to our Juſtification, then is it no efficient Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental cauſe.

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Your ſcope in that page ſeems to be againſt any diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing whatſoever about works, in this propoſition, <hi>We are juſtified by faith, and not by works,</hi> If ſo, that we muſt not run to any diſtinction, but ſay, that in every motion or ſenſe, Works are excluded, and do juſtifie in none, then I profeſs it is paſt my uttmoſt skill to juſtifie you for accuſing <hi>Althamer</hi> as you do, for ſaying, <hi>Mentiris Jacobe in caput tuum:</hi> Yea if he had upon the reading of <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.36. riſen higher, and ſaid, <hi>Mentiris Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſte in caput tuum.</hi> For ſure he that ſaith <hi>[By thy words thou ſhalt be juſtified]</hi> Or <hi>by works</hi> a man <hi>unjuſtified, and not by faith only</hi>] can no way poſſibly be excuſed from that crime, if no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction may verifie his words; but they muſt then be taken as abſolutely falſe: which I will not be perſwaded of.</p>
                     <p>Treat. pag. 219. Serm. 23. Obſerv. <hi>That even the moſt holy and regenerate man is not Iuſtified by the works of grace which he doth. This truth is the more diligently to be aſſerted, by how much the error that confronts it is more ſpecious and refined, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by ſuch abettors, whoſe repute is not ſo eaſily caſt off as the former we ſpake of.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now you come purpoſely, I perceive to deal with me. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the repute of Abettors doth much to bear up opinions through the world, even with them that ſpeak moſt againſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit faith. But you need not deſpair of caſting off the repute of them you mention Mr. <hi>Robertſon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Crandon</hi> can teach any man that will learn that leſſon.</p>
                     <p>Treat. ib. <hi>The Queſtion is not, Whether we are Iuſtified by works, though flowing from grace, as meritorious or efficient of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification.
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:60968:59"/>
This the Opinioniſts we have to deal with, do reject with indignation. To make Works either merits or efficient cauſes of our Iuſtification before God, they grant it directly to oppoſe the Scriptures; yea they ſeem to be offended with the Orthodox, as gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving too much to faith, becauſe its made an Inſtrument of our Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification: therefore they are to be acquitted at leaſt from groſs Popery.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is one paſſage which I underſtand by your Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to you Sermons on <hi>John</hi> 17. you lookt for thanks for: and I do freely thank you for it: for the world is ſuch now, as that I muſt take my ſelf beholden to any man that doth injure me with moderation and modeſty. But you might have done that juſtice to us Opinioniſts, as to have put <hi>[any cauſes at all]</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of <hi>[efficient cauſes]</hi> when we had ſo often told you (the Orthodox) that we diſclaimed all true cauſality; and then your Reader would have been ready to hope that we are free alſo from the finer Popery as well as the groſs. But ſince I have heard of late times, what it is that goes under the name of Antichriſtianity and Popery, even with many that are able to call themſelves Orthodox, and others that diſſent from them, worſe then Opinioniſts; I confeſs I begin to have charitable thoughts of a man that is but freed from the charge of groſs Popery: and if thoſe tongues ſhould free him alſo from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of all the finer Popery, I ſhould begin to ſuſpect that ſomewhat is amiſs.</p>
                     <p>Treat. ib. 2. <hi>Although to maintain faith and Obedience to be the conditions, and a</hi> cauſa ſine qua non <hi>of our Juſtification, be the profeſſed and avowed Doctrine of the Socinians, yet ſome of late have aſſerted the ſame Doctrine, that yet abhor Socinian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm</hi>—.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> For this alſo I give you the thanks which you expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, on the foreſaid grounds. But if we aſſert the ſame Doctrine with the Socinians, either it is the ſame <hi>falſe</hi> Doctrine, or the ſame <hi>ſound</hi> Doctrine. If the later, you might as well have ſaid, the Socinians aſſert that there is a God, and ſo do we: But to

what purpoſe? If the former, then either it is falſe <hi>quoad ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minos,</hi> or <hi>quoad ſenſum.</hi> The former cannot be ſaid without abſurdity: the words can have no other falſneſs, but an unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, diſtinct from the ſenſe: And if the terms be any part of <hi>Socinianiſm,</hi> then Chriſt and <hi>James</hi> were guilty of <hi>Socinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm; quod abſit.</hi> If it be the ſenſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Firſt, I crave no other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the impartial Reader, before he judge, then to read the <hi>Socinians</hi> explication of themſelves, and to read my expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation here, and in my confeſſion. Secondly, And if he will alſo peruſe the Allegations in the end of that confeſſion, let him judge whether the Orthodox be not guilty of <hi>Socinianiſm.</hi> Or if he be tempted to believe Dr. <hi>Owens</hi> intimations, as if I had dealt injuriouſly with the Authors there alleadged, I only deſire him to turn to the places cited, and peruſe them in the Authors, and freely cenſure me.</p>
                     <p>Treat. 220. <hi>Neither is the queſtion about the neceſſity of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,</hi> &amp;c. — <hi>Only the queſtion is upon what account theſe are required in juſtified perſons; whether in ſome</hi> cauſality, <hi>or concurrence as faith is, only not with ſuch a degree of excellency? Whether good works be required as well as faith, ſo that we may ſay, juſtifying Repentance, juſtifying Law, (Love, it ſhould be) as well as juſtifying faith? This is poſitively and vehmently affirmed by ſome: but certainly thoſe Arguments and Reaſons they bring are too weak to gainſay the Torrent of the Orthodox Divines.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Upon the reading of this, I complained of hard mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the Preface to my confeſsion: to which you reply ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in your Preface to Sermons on <hi>John</hi> 17. I ſhall recite the reaſons of my complaint. Firſt, I did both at large in private writings to your ſelf, and publiquely to the world, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that I took neither faith nor works for any cauſes at all of our Juſtification; was it juſt then to make this the ſtate of the Queſtion, and ſay I poſitively and vehemently affirmed it? (for you deny not that it is me that you mean, and I know it by paſſages here agreeable to your private letters) Secondly, I never once imagined the difference between faith and holy obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:60968:60"/>
or ſanctification, to lie (in order to Juſtification) in the degree of excellency. I never to my remembrance ſo thought, or wrote, or ſpoke. But the difference I laid here, firſt, That (as to actual obedience, yea and Repentance) faith hath a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar aptitude to this office, as being a Receptive act, and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the object, as that object is fitted to our neceſsity. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That (as to aſſent, deſire of Chriſt, love to Chriſt offered, accepting him as Teacher, and Lord) they are eſſential acts of faith, and ſo differ not at all, as they are by many ſuppoſed to do. Nay, I rather expected that ſome ſhould have charged me with preferring Holineſs before faith in excellency, while I made faith but the ſeed, and holyneſs as the fruit; faith to be but the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting, and Obedience the performance of what we conſented to; and in a word, while I made perfect holineſs the end of faith, becauſe the end is better then the means: And I was glad when I found you ſaying the like, <hi>Vindic. Legis, Lect.</hi> 4. <hi>pag.</hi> 45. [13. <hi>Holineſs and Godlineſs inherent, is the end of Faith and Juſtification.</hi>] But little did I think to have been charged, and that by you, for making the difference to lie in faiths higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of excellency, and only in that. Thirdly, I never owned the phraſe of <hi>[juſtifying Repentance, juſtifying Love.]</hi> nor ever ſaid that we may as well uſe theſe as <hi>[juſtifying faith]</hi> And when none of theſe things were ever ſaid or written by me, ought you to have left on record to Generations, that <hi>[this is poſitively and vehemently affirmed.]</hi> On the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this dealing, I muſt ſay again, O what is man, and what a ſad caſe were we in, if the beſt of men were our Judges! when they will not ſtick deliberately to publiſh to the preſent and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Ages, that we <hi>poſitively and vehemently</hi> affirm thoſe things, which we never thought nor wrote, but have by Letters and in printed books both poſitively and vehemently, &amp; very frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profeſſed the contrary. Is here any room for further diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting? yea, when I have told you of this dealing, you own it ſtill, and defend it in your Preface to your Sermons on <hi>John</hi> 17. I ſhall therefore before I proceed, examine that Defence.</p>
                     <p>Preface. <hi>pag.</hi> 3. [Now when I had endeavoured to ſtate the Queſtion in a moſt candid and fair way between thoſe
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:60968:61"/>
that deny a <hi>Condition ſine qua non</hi> of our Juſtification, and thoſe who affirm. A Reverend and Learned Brother, judging himſelf concerned in this opinion likewiſe, doth complain of the want of Candor and truth in my ſtating of the Queſtion, when I rather expected thanks for my Ingenuity: — Now let any judicious Reader, that is acquainted with controverſie, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide, wherein any (and or truth may be deſired here. For I ſay <hi>[cauſality]</hi> which is a general word, not efficiency or merit; Again, I ſay, ſome cauſality, <hi>Cauſalitas quaedam,</hi> which is <hi>terminus diminuens:</hi> yea I added the word <hi>Concurrence,</hi> which might ſatisfie any how low I brought the Queſtion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Will you call to any <hi>judicious Reader,</hi> to tell you that which I particularly expreſt to you? Again, Then let the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Reader judge whether you ſhould have ſaid to the world, any of the forementioned particulars; Firſt, That I give any Cauſality to works as to Juſtification. Secondly, Or that I difference them only in degree of excellency. Thirdly, Or that I affirm, that we may ſay, juſtifying Repentance, juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Love, as well as juſtifying faith. Fourthly, And this is affirmed poſitively, and vehemently: and all this when I had poſitively and vehemently denyed them. Fifthly, Yea, and that <hi>only</hi> this is the queſtion between us.</p>
                     <p>And what do your defences do to juſtifie ſuch dealing? [you ſaid only <hi>Cauſality</hi> in general, and not <hi>Efficiency</hi> or <hi>Merit</hi>] And did not I openly and privately to you deny <hi>Cauſality</hi> in general, and not only <hi>Merit</hi> or <hi>Efficiency</hi>? and is that poſitive or vehement affirming it? Secondly, you ſaid, <hi>Cauſalitas quaedam,</hi> which is <hi>terminus diminuens.</hi>] <hi>If quoad eſſe cauſalitatis</hi> it be <hi>termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus diminuens,</hi> then the meaning is, that I make them no cauſes. But do you think any Reader will Engliſh <hi>Cauſalitas quaedam,</hi> by <hi>[no Cauſality]</hi> But doubtleſs you mean that it is <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus diminuens</hi> as to the quality or nobility of the cauſe. But firſt, I never heard before that <hi>quaedam</hi> was <hi>terminus diminuens</hi>; and if no Readers muſt underſtand you, but thoſe that know this to be true, I think it will be but few. Secondly, But what if that were ſo? Did you not know that I denyed even <hi>all cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality,</hi> how diminute ſoever <hi>quaedam</hi> can expreſs, if it be but
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:60968:61"/>
real. Thirdly, But you added <hi>[Concurrence]</hi> But it was in Concurrence with the ſeveral unjuſt paſſages before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and ſure the neighbour-hood of that word hath not force enough to make them all true.</p>
                     <p>Preface. <hi>[My Reverend Brother ſaith, He vehemently diſclaimeth all Cauſality of works in Juſtification: ſurely his meaning is all Proper cauſal efficiency, and ſo did I in the ſtating of it: But to deny Cauſality in a large ſenſe, is to contradict him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſwer.</hi> If ſo, what hope of Juſtice? Muſt I in paper after paper diſclaim all true Cauſality, and will you not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſwade the world of the contrary, but perſiſt in it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I will or not, and ſay I mean a <hi>[proper cauſal efficiency]</hi> Reader, I have no other remedy left, but to adviſe thee, that if yet after this it be affirmed the next time that I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim not all true cauſality, or mean not as I ſay, thou believe not the affirmation.</p>
                     <p>Preface. [<hi>For in his Aphoriſ.</hi> 74. <hi>Theſ. They both,</hi> viz. <hi>Faith and Works juſtifie in the ſame kind of cauſality, or medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate it (ſhould be media,) and improper cauſes, or as</hi> Dr. <hi>Twiſs</hi> cauſae diſpoſitivae, <hi>but with this difference, Faith as the principal, Obedience as the leſs principal. Here is cauſality, though im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper; Here is a</hi> cauſa diſpoſitiva: <hi>and yet ſhall I be blamed after I had removed Efficiency and Merit?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſwer.</hi> This is but to add injuſtice. When I have written at large that faith and works are no true cauſes of Juſtification, and after tell you that a condition is commonly called <hi>cauſa ſine qua non,</hi> which is <hi>cauſa fatua,</hi> and no cauſe at all, but meerly nominal, having by cuſtom obtained that name, and that Dr. <hi>Twiſs</hi> calls this <hi>cauſa diſpoſitiva</hi>: when I ſay that they have only a cauſality improperly to called, which indeed is no cauſality. Is it juſtice for you ſtill to perſwade the world that I mean <hi>ſome cauſality,</hi> though not <hi>efficiency</hi>? The thing I renounce: the name is not it that you only charge me with: if
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:60968:62"/>
you had, I was not the maker of it. It was called <hi>cauſa ſine qua non,</hi> before I was born: I muſt comply with common lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, or be ſilent: eſpecially when I tell you, I take it for no Cauſe. You give me ſuch juſtice as the hoaſt of the Crown Tavern in <hi>Cheap-ſide</hi> had, who (as <hi>Speed</hi> ſaith,) was hanged for ſaying merrily, that his Son was Heir of the Crown, and his expoſition would not ſave his life. I pray you hereafter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move more then Efficiency and Merit. I take not works to be either the material or formal cauſe of Juſtification, no nor the <hi>final,</hi> though you (in the words before cited) affirm it ſuch. Who then gives more to works, you or I? The final cauſe is ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, becauſe it cauſeth us to chooſe the means to it; Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not a means of our uſing, but an act of God. Therefore works are not properly the end of it, as to us.</p>
                     <p>And yet let me ſay this to you, leſt you ſhould miſtake me: As vehemently as I diſown all true cauſality of works to our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, I intend not to fall out with all men that call them cauſes. As firſt, Not with <hi>Piſcator</hi> nor ſuch other that call them cauſes of our final abſolution and ſalvation. Secondly, Nor with thoſe that call them meritorious in the ſame ſenſe as the Fathers did, though they unfitly uſe the word. Thirdly, Nor with thoſe that will ſay, that becauſe they pleaſe God, and ſo are the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his complacency and will, they may therefore, ſpeaking after the manner of men, be called <hi>Procatarctike</hi> cauſes of his act of Juſtification: and ſo that the Amiableneſs and deſirableneſs of faith and holineſs, is the cauſe why he aſſigned them to this Noble place and office. Fourthly, Nor with them that ſay, faith is a moral or a Metaphorical, paſſive or active Inſtrument of Juſtification. Though I ſay not as theſe men, I will not quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with them.</p>
                     <p>Preface. <hi>But I need not run to this; for my Arguments militate againſt works, at works juſtifying under any pretended Notion whatſoever.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſwer.</hi> By the help of this, I ſhall interpret all your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments. And if ſo, then they militate againſt the act of faith juſtifying under the pretended notion of an Inſtrument, unleſs
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:60968:62"/>
you will ſay that faith is no Act, or Inſtrumentality is no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended notion.</p>
                     <p>Preface. <hi>And this maketh me admire how my learned Brother could let fall one paſſage wherein he may be ſo palpably and ocularly convinced to the contrary by the firſt looking upon my Arguments; that which he ſaith is [the ſtrength of my Arguments, lies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſuppoſition, that conditions have a moral efficiency]— There is no one of theſe ten Arguments brought againſt Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by works, as a</hi> Condition ſine qua non, <hi>that is built upon this ſuppoſition, or hath any dependance on it, only in the fourth Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument after their ſtrength is delivered, I do</hi> ex abundanti, <hi>ſhew that a Condition in a Covenant ſtrictly taken hath a moral efficiency.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Firſt, you confeſs it is your Aſſertion, that ſuch Conditions have a moral efficiency. Secondly, I never ſaid that you made that a <hi>Medium</hi> in all your Arguments, nor that you intended that as their ſtrength; but that their ſtrength lyeth on that ſuppoſition; and if I have miſtaken in that, I will not ſtand in it: But I think to ſhew you that without that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition your Arguments have no ſtrength: which if I do, then judge at what you marvailed.</p>
                     <p>But its a farther act of injuſtice in you, in alleadging me <hi>Apol. pag.</hi> 8. ſaying that ſome conditions are impulſive cauſes, when I told you it is not <hi>qua</hi> conditions, but only as materially there is ſomewhat in them that is meritorious. I doubt not but the ſame thing may be the matter of a cauſe and a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall now return to your Lect. of Juſtification, and there ſpeak to the other paſſage in your preface, about juſtifying Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>Treat. <hi>pag.</hi> 220. [<hi>This therefore I ſhall (God willing) undertake to prove, that good works are not a condition, or</hi> a cauſe ſine qua non of <hi>our Juſtification.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſwer.</hi> But remember that it is Juſtification, either as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:60968:63"/>
in conſtitution, or continued, or as pronounced by the Judges Sentence, that the Queſtion comprehendeth, and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the putting us into a juſtified ſtate; And its works under any notion that you ſpeak of, and not only under the reduplication, <hi>quà</hi> works.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I diſtinguiſh between works in <hi>Pauls</hi> ſenſe, and works in <hi>Iames</hi> his ſenſe. And becauſe you ſay ſo much againſt diſtinguiſhing of <hi>works,</hi> (before) as deceitful; I will firſt prove the neceſſity of diſtinguiſhing. 1. Works in <hi>Pauls</hi> ſenſe are ſuch as make the Reward to be not of Grace, but of Debt. Works in <hi>Iames</hi> his ſenſe are not ſuch: therefore they are not the ſame. Works in <hi>Pauls</hi> ſenſe, are <hi>actions as valuable offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to God,</hi> and juſtifying by their value. But works in <hi>Iames</hi> his ſenſe, are none ſuch. Proved. The works that <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks of muſt neceſſarily be done: Works in <hi>Pauls</hi> ſenſe, we may not ſo much as imagine that we can do; <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as make the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of Debt, and not of Grace. Though the matter of ſuch works may be done, which Juſticiaries thus conceive of, yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch a notion, no man may once imagine that he hath them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Works in <hi>Pauls</hi> ſenſe are ſuch as ſtand in competition with Chriſt, or at leaſt, would be co-partners with him in a co-ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. But works in <hi>James</hi> his ſenſe are none ſuch, but ſuch as ſtand in a due ſubordination to Chriſt; ſuch undoubtedly there are: And ſuch <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks of.</p>
                     <p>That <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of works as Competitors with Chriſt, or as co-ordinate, an hundred Texts will prove; and the caſe is ſo plain, that I think it not worth the inſiſting on, ſeeing the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial reading over the Epiſtles may ſatisfie.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I diſtinguiſh of <hi>Juſtifying, quoad modum procurandi,</hi> or of the diſtinct Intereſts of mens actions therein, ſignified in the prepoſition <hi>[By.] Paul</hi> ſpeaks of Juſtification <hi>[By]</hi>
                        <pb n="103" facs="tcp:60968:63"/>
works, as <hi>by valuable</hi> deſerving cauſes, or procatar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctike cauſes, moving God to juſtifie us by their worth, or by ſome true cauſality <hi>procuring</hi> it. But <hi>Iames</hi> ſpeaks of Works as ſuppoſing the perfect Satisfaction and Merit of Chriſt, and that all that is valuable to the cauſal procurement of our Juſtification is to be found in him alone, and therefore he leaves no cauſality herein to works but takes them as a meer condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which ceaſe ſuſpending when performed. For the efficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of a condition, is only in ſuſpending till performed: And ſo Rebellion can ſuſpend; when the ceaſing of that Rebellion by obedience, doth not cauſe, but only ceaſe ſuſpending.</p>
                     <p>Now I anſwer to your <hi>Minor,</hi> that <hi>Abraham</hi> was not juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by works in <hi>Pauls</hi> ſenſe, but he was in <hi>Iames</hi>'s ſenſe, unleſs you will own the ſaying which you chide <hi>Althamer</hi> for. (Though I muſt ſay that in his <hi>Conciliationes Loc. Script. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thamer</hi> deals more mannerly with <hi>Iames.) Abraham</hi> was not juſtified by works, as making the Reward of debt, and not of grace: for he had no ſuch works: But <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtified 1. By the act of faith, as a condition: therefore by an act under ſome notion. I know of few Divines that deny that faith is a condition of Juſtification. 2. However you confeſs your ſelf that <hi>Abraham</hi> was Juſtified by faith as an inſtrument: and you ſay that it was by the act of faith (and not the habit.) And though you take this to be but a nominal act, and really a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, yet ſo do not others: for herein you are more ſingular (a thouſand to one, as far as I am able to underſtand) then I am in the Doctrine which you charge with ſingularity. 3. The faith that <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtified by, was not only a bare appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of Chriſts Righteouſneſs, but a receiving of Chriſt as Chriſt, which is called, <hi>Works,</hi> by your party. 4. It was either <hi>By</hi> or <hi>Becauſe</hi> of his External Obedience, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified. Proved. 1 By <hi>Iames</hi> 2.21. Was not <hi>Abraham</hi> our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther juſtified by works, when he had offered <hi>Iſaac</hi> his ſon up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Altar? 2. From <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.12, 16, 18. <hi>By my ſelf have I ſworn ſaith the Lord, for becauſe thou haſt done this thing, and haſt not with-held thy ſon, thine only ſon, that in bleſſing I will bleſs thee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And in thy ſeed ſhall all the Nations of the earth be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, becauſe thou haſt obeyed my voice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> But then I muſt add, that
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:60968:64"/>
this was none of <hi>Abrahams</hi> firſt Juſtification, for he was juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this; but it was a renewed Acceptance and Approbation of God, and a kind of ſentential Declaration thereof, by the voice of the Angel. But a Juſtification it was, and ſo <hi>James</hi> calls it.</p>
                     <p>Now let us hear your Replies.</p>
                     <p>Treat. pag. 221. <hi>This cannot be a ſolid Anſwer.</hi> 1. <hi>Becauſe the Apoſtle ſpeaketh generally of works in this deſcription of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, though in other places he ſometimes ſaith</hi> [the works of the Law] <hi>yet</hi> Abraham <hi>could not be Inſtanced in for ſuch works,</hi> &amp;c. — <hi>When we read the Holy Ghoſt ſpake generally of all works, who are we that we ſhould limits it to ſome? — By their interpretation, the believer ſhould be oppoſed only to ſome kind of works and faith,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The ordinary ſtrain of the Apoſtles ſpeech, being expreſſive of the <hi>works of the Law,</hi> is Expoſitory of the reſt, 1. Becauſe a few paſſages muſt be uſually expounded by many. 2. And becauſe a few (much more abundance of) limiting paſſages, muſt expound thoſe where the reſtriction is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Have not I ever yielded to you that all works are excluded from Juſtifying as works? but it follows not that therefore they are (as you may ſay) excluded under any Notion whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. And why might not <hi>Abraham</hi> be inſtanced in? Your proof is none. 1. Is it not a good Argument <hi>Negative, Abraham</hi> was not juſtified by works, therefore we are not? And a good Argument to prove the Antecedent: Becauſe he had no works that could juſtifie: No nor thoſe which were then truſted on to Juſtification. 2. Doth not <hi>Paul</hi> ſhew that he ſpeaks of theſe, when he proves his aſſertion, 1. Becauſe <hi>Abraham</hi> was then in uncircumciſion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.10. (what's that to Goſpel obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence?) 2. Becauſe the Law was long after the promiſe, and was not then given, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.17. 3. <hi>Paul</hi> maketh it all one to be juſtified by works, and to be juſtified by the Law; as abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of paſſages ſhew. A multitude of particular Texts do
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:60968:64"/>
expreſly ſhew that it is a Legal Iuſtification only that he ſpeaks of, and that he directly intendeth only Legal works. I will now inſtance but in one, <hi>viz. Rom.</hi> 4.13. compared with <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.18. [<hi>For the promiſe that he ſhould be heir of the world, was not to</hi> Abraham <hi>and his ſeed by the Law, but through the righteouſneſs of faith.</hi>] Now compare with this, the words of the promiſe it ſelf, <hi>[And in thy ſeed ſhall all the Nations of the earth be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, becauſe thou haſt obeyed my voice.]</hi> So ver. 16, 17. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou haſt done this thing,</hi> &amp;c.]</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Its not eaſie to conceive how any man can expect a Legal or Phariſaical Iuſtification by Evangelical works without a groſs contradiction: For example; to be juſtified Legally by Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical faith, deſire, love, thanks, joy, ſelf-denyal, confeſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are all palpable contradictions: And ſuch a mans faith muſt be thus expreſt; <hi>I expect to merit Iuſtification legally, by believing in Chriſt as the ſole Meriter of my Iuſtification and ſalvation, or by deſiring Chriſt, or by loving Chriſt as the ſole Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riter of my ſalvation: Or by thanking him, or rejoycing in him as the Sole-meriter of my ſalvation? Or I expect legally to merit Iuſtification, by denying that I can merit it, by any righteouſneſs of my own; or by confeſſing that I deſerve damnation by my ſins, or by praying or ſeeking for ſalvation by free gift, as merited only by Chriſt.]</hi> All theſe are palpable contradictions; and no man can hold both that knoweth what he doth.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Yet I will ſuppoſe that though no man can ſo truſt to his works for legal Juſtification, that are apprehended by him as <hi>Formally</hi> Evangelical, yet perhaps he may do it by ſome works that are <hi>Materially</hi> Evangelical, and fancied by him to be what they are not. And ſo I ſtill ſay, that though it were Legal works that <hi>Paul</hi> did directly diſpute againſt, yet conſequenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and indirectly he diſputeth againſt works commanded only in the Goſpel, if men will do them to Legal ends, and fancy them to be of the value legally to juſtifie them.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. I will therefore ſuppoſe ſome men to be ſo unreaſonable, as to expect a Legal Juſtification, by their believing or confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that Chriſt only can Legally juſtifie them, and not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and ſo I will grant you, that <hi>Paul</hi> doth (conſequenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally) exclude <hi>all works,</hi> even Evangelical works from Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:60968:65"/>
But though he exclude <hi>all works,</hi> yet not in every notion, nor doth he exclude <hi>All intereſt</hi> of All works in our Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. All works as <hi>valuable offerings,</hi> he excludes, and ſo as me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious, not only in point of Commutative Juſtice, but alſo in point of Legal worth and Legal Juſtice, as the Phariſees ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed them meritorious: All works he excludes from all proper Cauſality. But he doth not exclude all works from having any Intereſt at all in ſubordination to Chriſt. Do you verily believe that Repentance and Faith have no Intereſt in our Pardon, in ſub-ordination to Chriſt? If you ſay, <hi>No, not any,</hi> you contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict God, and your ſelf, and all the Chriſtian world. If you ſay, <hi>Yea, but they juſtifie not</hi> qua <hi>works</hi>; you ſay nothing to the controverſie: For I have over and over as loud as you, profeſſed that they juſtifie not <hi>formaliter</hi> as works. If you ſay they have any Intereſt: 1. Tell us better what it is. 2. And then you confute your general aſſertion. There's no Chriſtian that I know but will confeſs that the Goſpel works have the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of Declaring <hi>ſigns</hi> in our final Iuſtification. And few will deny that Repentance hath the intereſt of a neceſſary qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or condition to our firſt Juſtification. Now would you perſwade us that <hi>Paul</hi> excludeth this kind of Intereſt, or oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth faith to it? If not againſt the <hi>ſignal</hi> intereſt of works, then not againſt all Intereſt; therefore if <hi>Pauls</hi> general excluſion will conſiſt with your <hi>ſignal</hi> Intereſt, then I ſhall maintain that it will conſiſt with the fore-explained <hi>Conditional</hi> intereſt.</p>
                     <p>I will not therefore be guilty of your charge of limiting the Holy Ghoſt. If he ſpake of all works, I will believe he means <hi>All works.</hi> But 1. If he over and over near an hundred times at leaſt, explain himſelf as ſpeaking of the Law, I will not ſhut my ears againſt that explication. And 2. I will grant it is alſo <hi>all Evangelical Works,</hi> at leaſt by conſequence: But I need not therefore grant that becauſe he excludeth <hi>All Work,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he excludeth <hi>All kind</hi> of <hi>Intereſt</hi> of all works; but only that ſort which he diſputeth againſt.</p>
                     <p>Beſides all this, I muſt diſtinguiſh of <hi>Juſtification, Legal</hi> and <hi>Evangelical,</hi> reſpective to the promiſes and threatnings of the Law and Goſpel, which do differ. No works at all did ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie <hi>Abraham,</hi> from the charge of the Law, <hi>Thou art a ſinner,</hi>
                        <pb n="107" facs="tcp:60968:65"/>
as being the Righteouſneſs of the Law, and the matter of that Juſtification. Nor will any works at all ſo juſtifie us. But it doth not follow, that therefore no works will juſtifie a man from the falſe accuſation of being an Impenitent, Unbeliever, and ſo having no part in Chriſt, whoſe Righteouſneſs muſt ſtop the mouth of the Law: Or that no works are the matter of the righteouſneſs required in this Conſtitution, <hi>[He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth ſhall be ſaved: Repent that your ſins may be blotted out.]</hi> Which are here required as the condition of our freedom from the Law, by the righteouſneſs of Chriſt. In a word, <hi>Paul</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows a large diſpute to prove that no works of ours do anſwer the expectation of the Law, and ſo cannot juſtifie us them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from its Accuſation. Its an ill conſequence, that therefore <hi>Paul</hi> proveth that no works of mans do anſwer the ſpecial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution or condition of the Goſpel [<hi>Repent and Believe in Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c.] and ſo are not the Condition of our intereſt in that perfect righteouſneſs of Chriſt, which is the only <hi>valuable</hi> cauſe of our foreſaid Juſtification.</p>
                     <p>Treat. 222. <hi>Again, that works of all ſorts are excluded, is plain, if you conſider the Object of Iuſtification, who it is that is here ſaid to be juſtified, and that is, the ungodly. By the</hi> ungodly <hi>is one meant that hath not a ſufficient and adequate holineſs: ſo that</hi> Abraham <hi>though regenerated, yet as to Iuſtification is ungodly, he cannot ſtand before God, or endure, if all his imperfections be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired after. Now certainly he that fulfilleth the conditions of Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, cannot be called ungodly; for he doth all that is required.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Again, I grant all works excluded: but not in all their relations; nor are all their Intereſts in Juſtification excluded. 2. This Argument I ſhould not have expected from you. You confeſs that by <hi>ungodly,</hi> is meant ſuch, though Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate and holy, that have not an adequate holineſs: Adequate; To what? to the Law? or to the conſtitution of the condition in the Goſpel? Marvel not if I deny the Conſequence of your Argument, and if I be unable to digeſt your reaſon for it. You ſay, <hi>[He that fulfilleth the Condition of Iuſtification, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be called ungodly.]</hi> But what <hi>Condition?</hi> I confeſs he that
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:60968:66"/>
fulfilleth the <hi>Laws</hi> condition cannot be called <hi>ungodly,</hi> nor be unjuſtifiable by that Law. But he that performeth the <hi>Goſpel</hi>-Condition of liberation, may be called <hi>ungodly</hi> in the ſenſe you now mentioned, that is, unjuſtifiable immediatly for his works by the Law: or one that hath not an holineſs adequate to the Law. Though indeed he cannot be called <hi>Evangelically ungodly.</hi> I ſuppoſe you clearly ſee that your Argument makes as much againſt any Condition of Juſtification in us, as againſt works being the condition. For againſt faith it ſelf, being any Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, you may equally argue, [<hi>Its the ungodly that are juſtified: But he that fulfilleth the conditions of Iuſtification, is not to be called ungodly.</hi> Ergo, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] But if you take <hi>ungodlineſs</hi> (as you do) for unadequate holineſs (to the Law) I deny your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor. Can no man but the Perfectly obedient, perform the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of pardon in the Goſpel?</p>
                     <p>Treat. ib. <hi>So that this is very conſiderable, that all thoſe whom God juſtifieth, he juſtifieth them not for any thing they have of their own, or any conditions they have performed; but as ſuch who are ſinners in a ſtrict examination, and ſo deſerve condemnation, and therefore no works of grace are looked upon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> I have anſwered this fully in <hi>Colvinus.</hi> 1. Though Proteſtants oft ſay, that God ſaveth men <hi>for</hi> their obedience, and Scripture uſe the term <hi>[becauſe]</hi> oft, yet I am willing to yield to you that men be not ſaved nor juſtified <hi>for</hi> any thing of their own, or <hi>for</hi> any conditions: But yet he would <hi>not juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie</hi> them <hi>without</hi> the performance of ſome conditions; but would condemn them <hi>for</hi> the non-performance, even with a ſpecial condemnation, diſtinct from that which is <hi>for</hi> their ſins againſt the Law.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Colvinus</hi> was the firſt man, and you are the ſecond that ever I read (to my remembrance) ſaying that God juſtifieth men <hi>as ſinners. A quatenus ad omne valet conſequentia.</hi> If <hi>as ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> then all <hi>ſinners</hi> are juſtified. If not as performers of any Condition, then not <hi>as</hi> Believers! Theſe things want proof.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="109" facs="tcp:60968:66"/>Treat. ib. <hi>Laſtly, that all works are excluded, is evident by the Apoſtles allegation out of</hi> David, <hi>who makes mans bleſſedneſs to be in this, that God imputeth righteouſneſs without works.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This is ſufficiently anſwered in the former. 2. <hi>Paul</hi> hence immediately concludeth that Righteouſneſs comes not only on the Circumciſion: whence you may ſee what works he means. 3. Your ſelves expound the foregoing term <hi>ungodly,</hi> of men that have not <hi>adequate</hi> holineſs, though ſincere; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you muſt ſo take this equipollent term <hi>[without works]</hi> for <hi>[without that adequate holineſs]</hi>: but it follows not, that therefore its without any humane act. 4. Yet ſtill I grant this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that its without any humane act, conſidered as the matter of a Legal righteouſneſs, or as oppoſite to Chriſt, or co-ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate with him: but not without any humane act, as ſubordinate to Chriſt, and as the matter of that Evangelical righteouſneſs which is required in this Conſtitution <hi>[Repent and Believe the Goſpel] viz.</hi> ſincerely.</p>
                     <p>Treat. pag. 223. <hi>And indeed it is at laſt confeſſed, that its faith only that makes the contract between God and the ſoul: that good works are not required to this initial conſenting unto Chriſt, ſo as to make him ours, but in the progreſs. This is that in effect, which the Papiſts affirm in other words, That the firſt Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is only by faith, but the ſecond by good works.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> How would you have your Reader underſtand theſe two inſinuations? 1. Have I ſo oft aſſerted that which you call my Confeſſion, and put it into an <hi>Index</hi> of diſtinctions, leaſt it ſhould be over-lookt, and told you as much ſo long ago in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate writings, and do you now come out with an <hi>[Its at laſt confeſſed.]</hi> I hope you would not intimate that ever I denyed it: or that ever I wrote Book of that ſubject, wherein I did not expreſly averre it. But then (that you think not better of me then I deſerve) I muſt tell you, that when I ſtill excluded works from our <hi>begun</hi> Juſtification, it was external Obedience, and not Repentance, nor thoſe acts of faith (even the Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:60968:67"/>
Chriſt as Lord and Teacher) which thoſe that oppoſe me call works.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If you take it but for an argument to convince ſuch as I, that [<hi>the Papiſts hold it:</hi> Ergo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] I muſt complain that it is uneffectual: But if you intend it for another effect on other perſons, <hi>viz.</hi> to affright them with the ſound of ſo horrid a name, or drive them away by the ſlink of it, then you may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly attain your ends. But you ſhould have attempted it only by truth. Is it true, that <hi>[this is that in effect, which the Papiſts affirm in other words?]</hi> Yea is it not a notorious truth, that <hi>it is quite another thing which the Papiſts affirm in ſomewhat like words?</hi> 1. The world knows that the Papiſts by the firſt Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, mean the firſt infuſion of renewing ſpecial grace. 2. And that by the ſecond Juſtification, they mean, the adding of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther degrees of Sanctification, or actuating that which before was given. 3. That they hold, faith juſtifieth in the firſt Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication <hi>conſtitutivè.</hi> 4. And that works or holineſs juſtifie <hi>conſtitutivè</hi> in the ſecond Juſtification, even as <hi>Albedo facit al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum, vel doctrina indita facit doctum.</hi> On the other ſide, I have told you often privately and publikely, that, 1. By Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I mean not Sanctification, nor any Phyſical, but a Relative change. 2. That by firſt and ſecond, I mean not two ſtates, or works, but the ſame ſtate and works as begun, and as continued. 3. That faith juſtifieth neither <hi>conſtitutivè &amp; inhaerenter,</hi> nor as any cauſe, but as a Receiving Condition. 4. And that works of external obedience are but a diſpoſitive condition, and an excluſion of that ingratitude that would condemn. And now judge on ſecond thoughts, whether you here ſpeak the words of Truth or Equity.</p>
                     <p>Treat. ib. <hi>Againſt this general excluſion of all works, is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi> ver. 4. <hi>where the Apoſtle ſaith,</hi> To him that worketh the Reward is of debt; <hi>from whence they gather that works only which are debts, are excluded.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> I never uſed or heard ſuch a collection. All good works are debts to God; but our collection is, that works which are ſuppoſed by men to make the reward of Debt, and not of Grace, are excluded.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="110" facs="tcp:60968:67"/>Treat. <hi>But if this be ſeriouſly thought on, it makes ſtrongly againſt them; for the Apoſtles Argument is</hi> à Genere: <hi>if it be by works, its of Debt: therefore there are not works of Debt, and works of no Debt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If the Apoſtle argue <hi>à Genere,</hi> then he argueth not from an Equivocal term; and therefore of no works but what fall under his <hi>Genus.</hi> 2. And the Apoſtles <hi>Genus</hi> cannot be any thing meerly Phyſical, becauſe his ſubject and diſcourſe is moral: and therefore it is not every act that he excludeth. 3. Nor can it be every Moral Act that is his <hi>Genus</hi>: but only <hi>Works</hi> in the notion that he uſeth the word; that is, All ſuch Works as Workmen do for hire, who expect to receive wages for the worth or deſert of their works.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall therefore here confute your aſſertion, and ſhall prove that <hi>All works do not make the Reward to be of Debt, and not of Grace:</hi> and conſequently that <hi>Paul</hi> meaneth not either every Act, or every Moral Act, here; but only works ſuppoſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardable for their value! (What you mean by <hi>Works of Debt,</hi> and <hi>Works not of Debt,</hi> I know not: they are not Scripture words, nor my words; For ſtill I ſay, All Good works are of Debt to God from man.)</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argument</hi> 1. <hi>Ex natura rei</hi>; There are many Moral Acts that make not the Reward <hi>from men</hi> to be of Debt, and not of Grace: Much leſs will ſuch Works make the Reward from God to be of Debt, and not of Grace. The Conſequence is grounded on theſe two or three Reaſons. 1. God is infinitely above us; and therefore leſs capable of being obliged by our works then man. 3. God is our abſolute Proprietary, and we are wholly his; and therefore we can give him nothing but his own. 3. God is our Supreme Rector, and we are bound to a perfect fulfilling of his Law: and we are ſinners that have broak that Law, and deſerve eternal death: therefore we are leſs capable of obliging him by our works as our Debtor, then of obliging men (and indeed uncapable.) 4. Gods Reward is Eternal Glory, and mans is but ſome tranſitory thing: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are leſs capable of making God our Debtor for Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:60968:68"/>
and Salvation, then man for a trifle. This proves the Conſequence.</p>
                     <p>Now the Antecedent I prove by Inſtances. 1. If a man be ready to drown in the water, and you offer to help him out, if he will lay hold of your hand: this act of his is <hi>Actus humanus vel moralis,</hi> and yet makes not the deliverance to be of Debt, and not of Grace. 2. If a man be in priſon for Debt and you ranſom him, and offer him deliverance on condition he will but conſent to come forth on the account of your Ranſom: this moral Action makes not his Deliverance to be of Debt, and not of Grace. 3. If a man be condemned for Treaſon, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Ranſom made, you procure and offer him a pardon, on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition he will take it, or if you ſay, <hi>If you will give me thanks for it, or take it thankfully</hi>; or, <hi>If alſo you confeſs your Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>; or, <hi>If alſo you crave pardon of the Prince</hi>; or, <hi>If alſo you confeſs me your benefactor</hi>; or, <hi>If alſo you will profeſs your purpoſe to take up rebellions arms no more</hi>; or, <hi>If alſo you will openly profeſs the Princes Soveraignty, and renounce the Leaders of the Rebells, whom you have followed; <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon any one, or on all theſe conditions, you ſhall have a free and full pardon; without any coſt or ſuffering of your own.</hi> Do you think that any of theſe do make the pardon to be of Debt, and not of Grace? 4. If you give a man a Lordſhip on condition he take it as a free Gift from you, and pay you yearly a grain of ſand, or do ſome act of homage (as to ſay I thank you) which hath in it no conſideration of value, but only of acknowledgment of dependance, doth this make your Gift to be not of Grace? 5. If you give a beggar a piece of gold, on condition he will take it, and put off his hat, and ſay, I thank you. I will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that any of theſe Acts do make the Reward to be not of Grace. But if you bid them, <hi>Go and do me ſo many daies work for it,</hi> importing ſomewhat profitable or valuable for your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, then the caſe is altered.</p>

                        <hi>Argument</hi> 3. Thoſe works which a man cannot be ſaved without, make not the Reward to be of Debt and not of Grace. But there are ſome works that we cannot be ſaved without. Therefore there are ſome works that make not the Reward of Debt and not of Grace.</p>
                     <p>The Major is proved by the expreſs excluſion of works in this ſenſe, from ſalvation: both as begun, and as conſummate, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>who hath ſaved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but his own purpoſe and grace,</hi> &amp;c. Epheſ. 2.8, 9. <hi>For by Grace ye are ſaved, through faith, and not of your ſelves, it is the gift of God: not of works, leſt any man ſhould boaſt,</hi> Tit. 3.5, 6, 7. <hi>Not by works of Righteouſneſs which we have done, but according to his Mercy he ſaved us by the waſhing of Regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> — that being juſtified by his Grace, we ſhould be made Heirs according to the hope of eternal life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. <hi>For the wages of ſin is death, but the Gift of God is eternal life through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi>] Act. 4.12. <hi>Neither is there ſalvation in any other,</hi> Mat. 25.34. <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you,</hi> &amp;c.] whence Expoſitors conclude againſt works.</p>
                     <p>The Minor may be proved by an hundred texts, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.35. <hi>For I was hungry,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.12. and 2.23. <hi>Mark</hi> 13.34. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.13. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2 14. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17. <hi>He will judge every man according to his works,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argument</hi> 4. Thoſe works which Grace commandeth, and cauſeth the Godly to perform, do not make the Reward to be not of Grace, but of debt. But there are ſome ſuch works. <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The Major is evident: What Saint dare ſay, that he hath a work that makes not the Reward of Grace, eſpecially when it is a work of Grace?</p>
                     <p>The Minor is as true as Scripture is true, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.8. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.10. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.17. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.21. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.21. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.24. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. and 3.8, 14. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.10. &amp;c. — Dare any ſay that God hath not commanded good works? or yet, that he hath commanded us in the Goſpel, ſo to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:60968:69"/>
work that the Reward may not be of grace, but debt? Will any ſay that the Saints do no good works? or elſe that they do ſuch good works as make the Reward to be not of Grace but of debt? I hope not.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argument</hi> 5. Repentance is a moral Act: Repentance mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the Reward to be of debt, and not of grace: therefore there are ſome works that make not the Reward to be not of grace, but of Debt. The ſame I ſay of Faith it ſelf, and other Acts.</p>
                     <p>But perhaps ſome one elſe will object, that though its true that there be ſuch works, yet they have no Intereſt in the buſineſs of our Juſtification, and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> doth hence exclude them. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Firſt, It ſufficed to my laſt purpoſe to prove that there are works which will not bear his deſcription, and therefore are not they that he means. Secondly, But that thoſe other works have ſome Intereſt in the buſineſs of our Juſtification, I have proved in the beginning. Repentance hath the promiſe of Pardon: ſo hath faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I'le not unſeaſonably here digreſs to this, but refer you to what is ſaid before and after, and elſewhere more at large.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argu.</hi> 6. In ver. 5. the oppoſite term [he that worketh not] doth not ſignifie him that performeth no moral act. Therefore in the fourth verſe, [he that worketh] doth not ſignifie him that doth perform any moral act. The conſequence is undeniable from the evident immediate oppoſition, between him that work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and him that worketh not. The Antecedent I prove, Firſt, From the words of the Text, which mention one act, even believing, as oppoſite to working, and implyed in, or conſiſtent with not working. [To him that worketh not, but believeth.] Secondly, Becauſe elſe it would ſubvert the Goſpel. What ſenſe would you make of it if you ſhould inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret this and ſuch texts as this of all moral Acts? Such as Chriſtian ears would abhor. If [working] be the <hi>Genus,</hi> and the Text will hold as extended to Believing, Repenting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as the <hi>ſpecies,</hi> and that even in their due Evangelical notion: Let us try them a little in ſuch an Expoſition. <hi>ver.</hi> 4, 5. [to him that worketh, that is, Repenteth, Believeth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Reward is not of Grace, but of Debt. But to him that worketh not, (that
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:60968:69"/>
is, that Repenteth not, Loveth not God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Deſireth not Chriſt or Grace, believeth not in Chriſt,) but believeth in him that juſtifieth the ungodly, his faith (ſuppoſing he have it not) is imputed to him for righteouſneſs.] Is this a ſweet and Chriſtian ſenſe? If we ſhould run over an hundred ſuch Texts by ſuch an Interpretation, you would hear no ſweeter Melody.</p>

I grant, that if faith juſtifie not as a condition, but <hi>proxime</hi> in any other reſpect, then Faith and Repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> juſtifie not in the ſame manner: ſo that the ſameneſs of their Intereſt in the general notion of a condition, ſuppoſeth faith to be a condition; but if you can prove that it is not, I ſhall grant the difference which you prove. Now it is not our queſtion here, whether faith be a condition, or an Inſtrument; but whether other works (as you chooſe to call them) or humane acts be condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Scripture taketh not faith in the ſame ſenſe as my Oppoſers do, when it gives it the peculiar expreſſions that you mention. Faith in <hi>Pauls</hi> ſenſe, is a Belief in Jeſus Chriſt (in all the reſpects eſſential to his perſon and office) and ſo a hearty Acceptance of him for our Teacher, Lord and Saviour; (Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour I ſay both from the guilt and power of ſin) and as one that will lead us by his word and ſpirit into Poſſeſſion of eternal Glory which he hath purchaſed.] So that it includeth many acts of Aſſent, and a Love to our Saviour, and deſire of him; and it implyeth ſelf-denial, and renouncing our own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and all other Saviours, and a ſenſe of our ſin and miſery, at leaſt, Antecedents or concomitants; and ſincere Affiance and Obedience in gratitude to our Redeemer, as neceſſary conſequents: And this faith is ſet by <hi>Paul,</hi> in oppoſition to the bare doing of the works of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law (and conſequently of any other works with the ſame intention) as ſeparated from Chriſt who was the end and life of it, or at leaſt, co-ordinate with him; and ſo as the immediate matter of a legal Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and conſequently as mercenary, and valuable in themſelves, or meritorious of the Reward. This is <hi>Pauls</hi> faith. But the faith diſputed for by my Opponents, is the Act of recumbency or Affiance on Chriſt at Juſtifier or Prieſt, which they call the Apprehenſion of Chriſts righteouſneſs; and this as oppoſed to the Acceptance of Chriſt as our Teacher<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> our Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:60968:72"/>
Head, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (further then theſe contain his Prieſthood:) and oppoſed to Repentance, to the love of our Saviour, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying our own righteouſneſs, confeſſing our ſins, and confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Chriſt to be our only Saviour, Thankfulneſs for free grace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which are called <hi>works</hi> by theſe men, and excluded from being ſo much as Conditions attending faith in our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation or Remiſſion of ſin.</p>
                     <p>The caſe may be opened by this ſimilitude. A Phyſitian cometh to a populous City in an Epidemical Plague: There is none can ſcape without his help: he is a ſtranger to them, and they have received falſe informations and apprehenſions of him that he is but a mountebank and deceiver; though indeed he came of purpoſe in love and compaſſion to ſave their lives, having a moſt coſtly receipt which will certainly cure them. He offereth himſelf to be their Phyſitian, and freely to give them his Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote, and to cure and ſave them, if they will but conſent, that is, if they will take him for their Phyſitian, and thankfully take his medicine; His enemies diſſwade the people from believing in him, and tell them that he is a Deceiver, and that if they will but ſtir themſelves, and work, and uſe ſuch dyet and medicines as they tell them of, they ſhall do better without him; and a third party that ſeem to be friends, tell them, though you do take him for your Phyſitian yet muſt you work your ſelf to health, and take thoſe other medicines as well as his, if you will be cured. But the Phyſitian ſaith, its only your truſting in me that can cure you. Now here we are at a loſs in the interpreting of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. Some ſay, that they muſt be cured barely by believing or truſting in him, and not by taking his perſon in the full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of a Phyſitian, or at leaſt, not by taking his medicine, which they abhor, nor by exerciſing or ſweating upon it, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the dyet and directions which he giveth them. But I rather interpret him thus; in requiring you to take him for your Phyſitian, it is implyed, that you muſt take his medicines, how bitter ſoever, and that you muſt order your ſelves according to his directions, and muſt not take cold, nor eat or drink that which he forbiddeth you; for though it be only his precious medicine that can cure you, yet if you will take thoſe things that are deſtructive to you, it may hinder the working of it, and an ill
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:60968:72"/>
dyet or diſordered life may kill you. The working therefore that he excluded, was not this implyed obſervance of his directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but your own Receipts and Labourings, as above-ſaid.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. I further anſwer to your obſervation, that the ſame Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture that ſaith, <hi>[We are juſtified by faith]</hi> doth alſo ſay, that <hi>Except ye Repent, ye ſhall all periſh. Luke</hi> 13.3, 5. And <hi>Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Ieſus Chriſt for the Remiſſion of ſins,</hi> Acts 2.38. and mentioneth the <hi>Baptiſm of Repentance for the Remiſſion of ſin</hi>; and joyneth the <hi>preaching of Repentance and Remſſion, Luke</hi> 24.47. <hi>Repent and be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, that your ſins may be blotted out,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 6.37. <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give and it ſhall be forgiven you, Jam.</hi> 5.15. <hi>The prayer of faith ſhall ſave the ſick — and if he have committed ſins they ſhall be forgiven him, Mat.</hi> 6.14, 15. <hi>If you forgive men their treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes, your heavenly Father will forgive you; but if you forgive not,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mark</hi> 11.11, 25. <hi>Forgive, that your Father may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give you.</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.9. <hi>If we confeſs our ſins, he is faithful and juſt to forgive us our ſins,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.6, 7, &amp;c.

                     <p n="4">4. Laſtly, to your argument from the peculiar attributions to faith, I ſay, that we do accordingly give it its prerogative, as far as thoſe attributions do direct us, and would do more, if it were not for fear of contradicting the Scripture.</p>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though I could willingly diſpatch with one man at once, yet becauſe it is the matter more then the perſon, that muſt be conſidered, I muſt crave your Patience as to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering of this Paragraph, till I come to the Diſpute about faiths Inſtrumentality, to which it doth belong, that ſo I may not trouble the preſent Diſpute by the Interpoſition of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

                     <p>

                     <p n="2">2. By <hi>[the ſame manner]</hi> either you mean, <hi>[the ſame ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifically</hi> (as ſpecified from the Covenant and Object) as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from Jewiſh Righteouſneſs, or from all falſe waies, or all Mercenary meritorious works (ſo intended), or any <hi>manner</hi> that is not ſubordinate to Chriſt, and implyed in Believing.] And thus your Antecedent is true, and your Conſequence (in your ſenſe of faith and works) is falſe; Or elſe you mean <hi>[the ſame manner]</hi> in oppoſition to any additional act implyed in our firſt believing as its neceſſary Conſequent.] And thus your Minor or Antecedent is falſe. If you will not believe me, believe your ſelf, who as flatly ſpake the contrary Doctrine, as ever I did, being not as it ſeems in every Lecture of the ſame thoughts; <hi>pag.</hi> 118. you write it for obſervation in a different Character, thus <hi>[For though holy works do not juſtifie, yet by them a man is continued in a ſtate of Juſtification: ſo that did not the Covenant of grace interpoſe, groſs and wicked waies would out off our Juſtification, and put us in a ſtate of Condemnation.]</hi> But becauſe you may avoid your own authority at pleaſure many waies, I ſhall give you a better authority that cannot be avoided.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In our firſt Juſtification, we were not <hi>juſtified by our words</hi>: but in our laſt Juſtification at Judgement we ſhall, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.36, 37. therefore they ſo far differ in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In our firſt Juſtification we were not juſtified <hi>by our works</hi>; but afterwards we are, in ſome ſenſe, or elſe <hi>James</hi> ſpoke not by the Spirit of God, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.24. The Major is plain, in that the works of <hi>Abraham, Rahab</hi> and ſuch like, that <hi>Iames</hi> ſpeaks of, were not exiſtent at their firſt Juſtification.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="123" facs="tcp:60968:73"/>3. In our firſt Juſtification we are not Judged, (and ſo Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified) <hi>according to our works.</hi> But in the laſt we are: therefore they differ in the manner.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. In our firſt Juſtification we are not juſtified by the mouth of the Iudge, in preſence paſſing a final irreverſible ſentence on us: but in the laſt we are: therefore they differ in the manner.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Our firſt pardon is not given us on condition of our firſt forgiving others: but the continuance is, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.35. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6.14, 15.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Our firſt pardon is not given us <hi>if we confeſs our ſins</hi>: (For we may be pardoned without that): but the renewed or continued pardon is, if we be called to it, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.9.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Reconciliation and final Juſtification is given to us in title, <hi>If we continue in the faith grounded and ſettled, and be not moved away from the hope of the Goſpel,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.23.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. In our firſt Believing we take Chriſt in the Relation of a Saviour, and Teacher, and Lord, to ſave us from all ſin, and to lead us to glory. This therefore importeth that we accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſubmit unto him, in thoſe his Relations, as a neceſſary means to the obtaining of the benefits of the Relations. Our firſt faith is our Contract with Chriſt, or Acceptance of him as our Saviour: And all contracts of ſuch nature, do impoſe a neceſſity of performing what we conſent to and promiſe, in order to the benefits. To take Chriſt for my Saviour, is to take him to ſave me, <hi>viz.</hi> from the power and guilt of ſin; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if I will not be ſaved by him when I have done, but had rather keep my ſin, then I did but nominally and hypocritically take him for my Saviour. To take him for my Teacher and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his Diſciple, importeth my Learning of him, as neceſſary to the benefit.</p>
                     <p>And in humane contracts it is ſo. Barely to take a Prince for her husband may entitle a woman to his honours and lands: But conjugal fidelity is alſo neceſſary for the continuance of them: for Adultery would cauſe a divorce. Conſent and liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may make a man your Souldier: but obedience and ſervice is as neceſſary to the Continuance, and the Reward. Conſent may make a man your ſervant, without any ſervice, and ſo give
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:60968:74"/>
him entertainment in your family. But if he do not actually ſerve you, theſe ſhall not be continued, nor the wages obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Conſent may enter a Scholar into your School: but if he will not Learn of you, he ſhall not be continued there. For all theſe after-violations croſs the ends of the Relations. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent may make you the ſubject of a Prince, but obedience is neceſſary to the continuance of your Priviledges. All Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants uſually tye men to ſomewhat which is to be performed to the full attainment of their ends. The Covenant-making may admit you, but its the Covenant-keeping that muſt continue you in your priviledges, and perfect them. See more in my <hi>Confeſſ.</hi> pag. 47.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But I further anſwer you, that according to the ſenſe of your party, of the terms <hi>[faith and works]</hi> I deny your conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence: For with them <hi>[Faith]</hi> is <hi>[Works]:</hi> And though in <hi>Pauls</hi> ſenſe we are not at all juſtified by works; and in <hi>Iames</hi> his ſenſe we are not at firſt juſtified by works: Yet in the ſenſe of your party, we are juſtified by works even at firſt. For the Accepting of Chriſt for our King and Prophet, is <hi>Works</hi> with them: and this is <hi>Pauls</hi> faith, by which he and all are juſtified. Repentance is works with them: And this is one of Gods Conditions of our pardon. The Love and Deſire of Chriſt our Saviour is works with them: but this is part of the faith that <hi>Paul</hi> was juſtified by. The like I may ſay of many acts of Aſſent, and other acts.</p>
                     <p>Treat. Lect. 24. p. 227. Argu. 4. <hi>He that is juſtified by ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling a Condition, though he be thereunto enabled by grace, yet he is juſt and righteous in himſelf: But all juſtified perſons, as to Iuſtification, are not righteous in themſelves, but in Chriſt their Surety and Mediator.</hi>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If this were true in your unlimited latitude, Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Righteouſneſs were the certaineſt evidence of damnation. For no man that had inherent Righteouſneſs, <hi>i. e.</hi> Sanctification, could be juſtified or ſaved. But I am loth to believe that.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This Argument doth make as much againſt them that take
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:60968:74"/>
                        <hi>Faith</hi> to be the Condition of Juſtification, and ſo look to be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by it as a Condition, as againſt them that make Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance or Obedience the Condition: And it concludeth them all excluders of the true and only Juſtification. I am loth to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from you: but I am loather to believe that all thoſe are unjuſtified, that take faith for the Condition of Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. They are hard Concluſions that your Arguments in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Righteouſneſs in a mans ſelf is either <hi>Qualitaetive,</hi> or <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative,</hi> called imputed. As to the later, I maintain that all the juſtified are Righteous in themſelves by an Imputed Relative Righteouſneſs, merited for them by Chriſt, and given to them. And this belief I will live and die in be the grace of God. Qualitative (and Active) Righteouſneſs is threefold. 1. That which anſwers the Law of works, <hi>[Obey perfectly and live.]</hi> 2. That which anſwers the bare letter of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, (without Chriſt the ſenſe and end) which required an operous task of duty, with a multitude of ſacrifices for pardon of failings, (which were to be effectual only through Chriſt <hi>whom</hi> the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing Jews underſtood not.) 3. That righteouſneſs which anſwers the Goſpel impoſition <hi>Repent and Believe.</hi> As to the firſt of theſe, A righteouſneſs fully anſwering the Law of nature. I yield your Minor, and deny your Major. A man may be juſtified by fulfilling the condition of the Goſpel which giveth us Chriſt to be our Righteouſneſs to anſwer the Law, and yet not have any ſuch righteouſneſs qualitative in himſelf, as ſhall anſwer that Law. Nay it neceſſarily implyeth that he hath none: For what need he to perform a Condition, for obtaining ſuch a Righteouſneſs by free gift from another, if he had it in himſelf. And as to the ſecond ſort of Righteouſneſs, I ſay, that it is but a nominal righteouſneſs, conſiſting in a conformity to the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter without the ſenſe and end, and therefore can juſtifie none: beſides that none fully have it. So that the <hi>Moſaeical</hi> Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſo far as is neceſſary to men, is to be had in Chriſt, and not in themſelves. But the performance by themſelves of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel Condition, is ſo far from hindring us from that gift, that without it none can have it. But then as to the third ſort of righteouſneſs qualitative, I anſwer, He that performeth the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:60968:75"/>
Goſpel Condition of Repenting and Believing himſelf, is not therefore Righteous in himſelf with that righteouſneſs qualita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive which anſwereth the Law of works. But he that perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſaid Goſpel Conditions, is Righteous in himſelf. 1. <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litatively</hi> and <hi>actively,</hi> with that righteouſneſs which anſwers the Goſpel Conſtitution, [<hi>He that believeth ſhall be ſaved,</hi> &amp;c.] which is but a particular Righteouſneſs, by a Law of Grace, ſubordinated to the other as the Condition of a free gift. 2. And Relatively, by the Righteouſneſs anſwering the Law of Works, as freely given by Chriſt on that Condition. This is evident, obvious, neceſſary, irrefragable truth, and will be ſo after all oppoſition.</p>
                     <p>Treat. pag. 228. <hi>Yea I think if it be well weighed, it will be found to be a contradiction, to ſay they are Conditions, and yet</hi> a Cauſa ſine qua non <hi>of our Juſtification; for</hi> a cauſa ſine qua non, <hi>is no Cauſe at all: but a Condition in a Covenant ſtrictly taken, hath a Moral efficiency, and is</hi> a Cauſa cum qua, <hi>not a</hi> ſine qua non.</p>

If you will not believe me, nor Lawyers, nor cuſtom of ſpeech, then remember at leaſt what it is that I mean by a Condition, and make not the difference to lie where it doth not.

If my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Brother now will contradict me only as to the fitneſs of the word, and ſay that <hi>ſacer</hi> ſignifieth only <hi>execrabilis,</hi> I will not be offended with him, though I will not believe him: but ſhould ſo good and wiſe a man proclaim in print, that <hi>ſacer</hi> ſignifieth only <hi>execrabilis,</hi> and therefore that though in <hi>word</hi> I call Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture <hi>Sacred,</hi> yet in deed I make it <hi>execrable,</hi> I ſhould ſay this were unkind dealing. What! plainly to ſay that a <hi>Verbal</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie is a <hi>Real</hi> one; and that contrary to my frequent pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed profeſſions! What is this but to ſay <hi>Whatever he ſaith, I know his heart to be contrary.</hi> Should a man deal ſo with your ſelf now, he hath ſomewhat to ſay for it: For you firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs <hi>Repentance and Reſtitution to be a Condition</hi> (as I do) and when you have done, profeſs <hi>Conditions to have a Moral Effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency</hi> (which I deny): But what's this to me, that am not of your mind?</p>
                     <p>Treat. pag. 229. <hi>A fifth Argument is that which ſo much ſounds in all Books. If good works be the effect and fruit of our Juſtification, then they cannot be Conditions, or</hi> Cauſa ſine qua non <hi>of our Iuſtification. But,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I deny the Minor in the ſenſe of your party; Our
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:60968:76"/>
firſt Repentance, our firſt deſire of Chriſt as our Saviour, and Love to him as a Saviour, and our firſt diſclaiming of all other Saviours, and our firſt accepting him as Lord and Teacher, and as a Saviour from the Power of ſin, as well as the guilt; all theſe are works with you; and yet all theſe are not the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of our Relative Juſtification; nor any of them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As to External acts and Conſequent internal acts, I deny your Conſequence, taking it of continued or final Juſtification; though I eaſily yield it as to our Juſtification at the firſt. 1. All the acts of juſtifying faith, beſides the firſt act, are as truly effects of our firſt Juſtification as our other graces or gracious acts are. And doth it therefore follow that they can be no Conditions of our continued Juſtification? Why not Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as well as Inſtruments or Cauſes? Do you think that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the firſt inſtantaneous act of faith doth juſtifie, and no other after through the courſe of our lives? I prove the contrary from the inſtance of <hi>Abraham</hi>: It was not the firſt act of his faith that <hi>Paul</hi> mentioneth when he proveth from him Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by faith. As its no good Conſequence <hi>[Faith afterward is the effect of Iuſtification before; therefore it cannot afterward juſtifie, or be a Condition.]</hi> So its no good Conſequence as to Repentance, Hope, or Obedience, 2. It only follows that they cannot be the Condition of that Juſtification whereof they are the effect, and which went before them (which is granted you.) But it follows not that they may not be the Condition of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued or final Juſtification. Sucking the breſt, did not cauſe life in the beginning: therefore it is not a means to continue it: It followeth not. You well teach that the Juſtification at the laſt Judgement is the chief and moſt eminent Juſtification. This hath more Conditions then your firſt pardon of ſin had, yea as many as your ſalvation hath, as hath been formerly proved, and may be proved more at large.</p>
                     <p>Treat pag. 230. <hi>By this we may ſee that more things are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to our Salvation, then to our Iuſtification; to be poſſeſſors of heaven, and (than it ſhould be) to entitle us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</hi>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Its true, as to our firſt Juſtifying; and its true as to our preſent continued ſtate: becauſe perſeverance is ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to ſalvation. But its not true as to our final ſentential Juſtification: There is as much on our part required to that, as to ſalvation it ſelf. 1. The promiſe makes no difference. 2. The nature of the thing doth put it paſt doubt. For what is our fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Juſtification, but a Determination of the Queſtion by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſentence, on our ſide, <hi>Whether we have Right to ſalvation or not</hi>? The 25. of <hi>Matthew</hi> ſhews the whole.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I argue againſt you from your own Doctrine here, thus; If Juſtification be it that gives us Right or Title to ſalvation, then that which is the Condition of our Right to ſalvation, is the Condition of our Juſtification: the Antecedent here is your own Doctrine, and is partly true: And the Conſequence is undenyable; whereto I add, [But the Doing of Chriſts Commandments is the Condition of our Right to ſalvation: therefore alſo of our Right to Juſtification, <hi>viz.</hi> as Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate. The Minor I prove, from <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.14. <hi>Bleſſed are they that do his Commandements, that they may have Right to the tree of life, and may enter in,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>Whoſoever ſhall call on the name of the Lord ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Rom. 10.13. Acts 2.21. <hi>We are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by hope,</hi> Rom. 8.24. <hi>Who ſo walketh uprightly ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Prov. 28.18. <hi>Baptiſm doth ſave us,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.21. <hi>[In doing this thou ſhall both ſave thy ſelf and them that hear thee.]</hi> 1 Tim. 4.16. If he <hi>[have not works, can faith ſave him?] Iames</hi> 2.14.</p>
                     <p>Treat. ib. <hi>Its true, that Iuſtification cannot be continued in a man, unleſs he continue in good works: Yet for all that, they are not Conditions of his Iuſtification: they are Qualifications and Determinations of tht ſubject who is juſtified; but no Conditions of his Iuſtification. As in the generation of man, &amp;c. Light is neceſſarily required, and dryneſs, as qualties in fire, yet,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Its well you once more confeſs that the thing is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary! Our queſtion then is only of the nature, and reaſon of that neceſſity? Whether it be <hi>neceſſitas medii ad finem,</hi> as to
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:60968:77"/>
the continuance or conſummation of our Juſtification? This I hope you will never deny. If <hi>medii,</hi> then what <hi>medium</hi> is it? not a cauſe. If not a condition, then tell us what, if you can.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, You ſay nothing to the purpoſe, when you give us Inſtances of <hi>Natural</hi> properties and qualifications. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that ſome of them are not <hi>media</hi> (as Light to burning) the reſt that are <hi>media,</hi> are <hi>Phyſically</hi> neceſſary <hi>ad finem</hi>: But Firſt, We are not diſcourſing of Phyſicks, and Phyſical neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities: but of Morals, and moral neceſſity. Secondly, You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not here pretend (or at leaſt prove) that there is an abſolute Phyſical neceſſity <hi>ad finem</hi> to every one of the things in queſtion to their end. Thirdly, Much leſs that this is the neareſt reaſon of their Intereſt, and that God hath not morally ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradded the neceſsity of a Condition by his Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>I prove that the neceſſity is moral. Firſt, It is impoſed by way of Precept, which cauſeth a moral neceſſity. Secondly, The Precept hath varied at the pleaſure of God, there being more Duties now, then formerly were, and ſome ceaſed that were then impoſed.</p>
                     <p>Yea, That its a condition having neceſſity <hi>ad finem,</hi> is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. Firſt, Becauſe it is the <hi>modus promiſſionis</hi> impoſed on us by God as Promiſer in a conditional form of words, as neceſſary to our attaining of the benefit promiſed. [<hi>If thou confeſs with thy mouth the Lord Jeſus, and believe in thy heart that God raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved,</hi> Rom. 10.9. <hi>If you forgive men their treſpaſſes, your heavenly Father will forgive you,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>Mat.</hi> 64.15. Secondly, And it is not of Phyſical neceſsity; for then God could not ſave us without it, but by a Miracle. Whereas he ſaved men before Chriſt by believing in a <hi>Meſſiah</hi> in general, without beliveing that this Jeſus is he, and without believing that he was actually conceived by the Holy Ghoſt, born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> was crucified, buried, roſe again, aſcended, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And he ſaveth Infants, that themſelves believe not at all; ſo that when you ſay it is a <hi>qualification of the ſubject,</hi> you mean either <hi>[the ſubject as juſtified]</hi> and that is nothing to the buſineſs: for then the queſtion is not what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:60968:78"/>
our actions have to that which is paſt, but to that which is future. Or elſe you mean <hi>the ſubject as to be Juſtified at Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or here to be ſo continued.</hi> And then the queſtion ſtill remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, whether thoſe qualifications are means or no means? <hi>And if means, of what ſort, if not conditions</hi>?</p>
                     <p>Treat. <hi>pag.</hi> 231. <hi>The ſixth Argument: If Juſtification be by works as a condition, then one man is more or leſs Juſtified then another; and thoſe works are required to one mans Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which are not to another, ſo that there ſhall not be two godly men in the world Juſtified alike. For if faith Juſtified as a work, then he that had a ſtronger faith, would be more Juſtified then he that hath a weaker.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Firſt, I grant the concluſion, if you had taken Works in <hi>Pauls</hi> ſenſe, for the works of a hirling, or any that are ſuppoſed to juſtifie by their value.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, I deny your firſt conſequence: And I give you the reaſon of my denyal (I hope a little better then yours for the proof of it) Firſt, It is not the <hi>degree</hi> of Repentance or Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience that is made the Condition of our continued and final Juſtification: but the <hi>Sincerity.</hi> Now the ſincerity is the ſame thing in one as in another; therefore one is no more juſtified hereby then another. Secondly, You might as well ſay, that different degrees of <hi>faith,</hi> make different degrees of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But that is not juſt, becauſe it lies all on the ſincerity; therefore it is as unjuſt here for the ſame reaſon.</p>
                     <p>Your Reaſon is ſuch as I expected not from you. [<hi>For if Faith</hi> (ſay you) <hi>juſtifie as a work</hi>] But who ſaith it doth <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie as a work?</hi> Your Reader that ſuſpecteth nothing, but fair in your words, may think I do; when I have again and again in <hi>terminis</hi> diſavowed it. And do you think it is a cogent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon indeed, <hi>[If works or faith juſtifie as a condition, there will be various degrees of Juſtification: Becauſe if it juſtifie as a work, there will be various degrees.]</hi> The reaſon of the Conſequence is as ſtrange to me, as <hi>a baculo ad angulum.</hi> Once more: Firſt, Faith doth not juſtifie as a Phyſical act: Secondly, Nor as a Moral act, or virtue in general. Thirdly, Nor as a mercena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:60968:78"/>
meritorious act. Fourthly, But as an act adapted to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and ſpecially fitted to this gratious deſign, it is choſen to be the condition, and repentance and ſelf-denyal accordingly to attend it. Fifthly, And as the appointed condition, we are juſtified by it. Sure therefore it doth not juſtifie as a work. But how they will avoid your conſequence that ſay it juſtifieth as an Inſtrument, let them ſee.</p>
                     <p>As to your Conſequence, I anſwer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Firſt, That which is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary, is ſincere Repentance and ſincere Obedience; and this is the ſame in all. Secondly, But the matter of both theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſins repented of, and the duties of Obedience may differ in many particulars in ſeveral perſons. One may not have the ſame ſins to Repent of as another, and one may have ſome particular duties more then another: though in the main, all have the ſame ſin and duty. But this difference is no abſurdity, nor ſtrange thing. When Chriſt mentioneth the final Juſtification of ſome, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. and gives the reaſon from their works [<hi>for I was hungry and ye fed me,</hi> &amp;c.] I read of none that took it for an abſurdity, becauſe. Firſt, The poor. Secondly, Infants. Thirdly, Thoſe that dye before they have opportunity, do no ſuch works.</p>
                     <p>Treat. <hi>pag.</hi> 231. <hi>The ſeventh Argument. This Aſſertion according to the ſenſe of the late Writers (that are otherwiſe Orthodox, for I mean not the</hi> Socinians) <hi>will bring in a Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication two waies, or make a twofold Juſtification, whereof one will be needleſs. For they grant an Imputation of Chriſts Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs in reſpect of the Law; he fulfilled that, and ſatisfied Gods Juſtice, that the Law cannot accuſe us. And beſides this, they make an Evangelical perſonal Righteouſneſs by our own Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical works. Now certainly this later is wholly ſuperfluous; for if Chriſts Righteouſneſs be abundantly able to ſatisfie for all that righteouſneſs which the Law requireth of us; what is the matter that it removeth not all our Evangelical failings, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that righteouſneſs alſo? ſurely this is to make the ſtars ſhine, when the Sun is in its full luſtre. Thus it may be obſerved, while men for ſome ſeeming difficulty avoid the good known way of truth, they do commonly bring in Aſſertions of far more difficulty
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:60968:79"/>
to be received. In this caſe its far more eaſie to maintain one ſingle Righteouſneſs,</hi> viz. <hi>the Obedience of our Lord Chriſt, then to make two,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, This twofold Righteouſneſs is ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing needleſs, that all ſhall periſh in everlaſting torment that have not both. I doubt not but you have both your ſelf; and therefore do but argue with all this confidence againſt that which you muſt be ſaved by, and which you carry within you. As if you ſhould argue that both a heart and a brain are needleſs, and therefore certainly you have but one. But the beſt is, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding you have but one, doth not really prove that you have but one; for if it did, it would prove you had neither; and then you were but a dead man in one caſe, and a loſt man in the other. Firſt, Did ever any man deny the neceſſity of inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Righteouſneſs, that was called a Proteſtant? <hi>Object.</hi> But thats nothing to its neceſſity to Juſtification. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, its the very being of it that you plead againſt as needleſs, if your words are intelligible. 2ly. Its as groſs a contradiction to talk of a Righteouſneſs that makes not righteous, or will not juſtifie <hi>in tantum,</hi> according to its proportion, as to talk of whitneſs that makes not white, or Paternity that makes not a father, or any form that doth not inform, or is a form, and is not a form.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, If there be two diſtinct Laws or Covenants, then there is a neceſsity of two dſtinct Righteouſneſſes to our Juſtification. But the Antecedent is certain. I ſuppoſe it will be granted that Chriſts righteouſneſs is neceſſary to anſwer the Law of works. And I ſhall further prove that a perſonal righteouſneſs given from Chriſt, is neceſſary to fulfill the condition of the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant or Law of Grace, <hi>believe and be ſaved,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Chriſt did not himſelf <hi>fulfill</hi> the condition of the Goſpel for any man, nor ſatisfie for his final non-performance; therefore he that will be ſaved, muſt perform it himſelf or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh. That Chriſt performed it not in perſon, is paſt doubt. It was not conſiſtent with his ſtate and perfection to repent of ſin, who had none to repent of; to return from ſin to God, who never fell from him; to beleve in Chriſt Jeſus, that is, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept himſelf as an offered Saviour, and to take himſelf as a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:60968:79"/>
to himſelf, that is, as one that redeemed himſelf from ſin, to deny his own righteouſneſs, to confeſs his ſin, to pray for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Do you ſeriouſly believe that Chriſt hath done this for any man? For my part, I do not believe it. Secondly, That he that hath not ſatisfied for any mans final predominant Infidelity and Impenitency, I know you will grant, becauſe you will deny that he dyed for any ſin of that perſon (or at leaſt, your party will deny it.) Thirdly, All that ſhall be ſaved, do actually perform theſe conditions themſelves. I know you will confeſs it, that none (adult) but the Penitent, Believers, Holy, ſhall be ſaved. This ſort of Righteouſneſs therefore is of neceſſity.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The Benefits of Chriſt obedience and death are made over to men by a conditional Promiſe, Deed of gift, or act of oblivion. Therefore the condition of that Grant or Act muſt be found before any man can be juſtified by the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt. It is none of yours till you repent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve: therefore you muſt have the perſonal Righteouſneſs of faith and repentance, in ſubordination to the imputed righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, that it may be yours. And will you again conclude, that <hi>[Certainly this later is wholly ſuperfluous].</hi> Hath not God ſaid? <hi>]He that believeth, ſhall be ſaved; and he that believeth not, ſhall be damned.]</hi> And <hi>Repent and be converted, that your ſins may be blotted out.</hi> &amp;c.] Is it not neceſſary that theſe be done then, both as duty commanded, and as a condition or ſome means of the end propounded and promiſed? And is this wholly ſuperfluous? In Judgement, if you be accuſed to have been finally impenitent, or an Infidel, will you not plead your perſonal faith and repentance, to juſtifie you againſt that accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation? or ſhall any be ſaved that ſaith, <hi>[I did not repent or believe, but Chriſt did for me?]</hi> If it be ſaid that [Chriſts <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction is ſufficient; but whats that to thee that performedſt not the conditions of his Covenant, and therefore haſt no part in it?</hi>] Will you not produce your faith and repentance for your Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication againſt this charge, and ſo to prove your Intereſt in Chriſt? Nay is it like to be the great buſineſs of that day to enquire whether Chriſt have done his part or no? or yet to enquire, whether the world were ſinners? or rather to judge them according to the terms of grace which were revealed
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:60968:80"/>
to them, and to try whether they have part in Chriſt or not; and to that end, whether they believed, repented, loved him in his members, improved his Talents of Grace or not? Or can any thing but the want of this perſonal righteouſneſs then hazard a mans ſoul?</p>
                     <p>But you ask [<hi>If Chriſts righteouſneſs be able to ſatisfie, what is the matter that it removeth not all our Evangelical failings?</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>Anſw.</hi> Either you ask this queſtion as of a <hi>penitent Believer,</hi> or the finally <hi>impenitent <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbeliever.</hi> If of the former, I ſay, Firſt, All his ſins Chriſts righteouſneſs pardoneth and covereth; and conſequently all the failings in Goſpel duties. Secondly, But his predominant final Impenitency and Infidelity Chriſt pardoneth not, becauſe he is not guilty of it; he hath none ſuch to pardon; but hath the perſonal righteouſneſs of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former of the conditions of the Goſpel: And for the finally impenitent Infidels, the anſwer is, becauſe they rejected that Righteouſneſs which was able to ſatisfie, and would not return to God by him; and ſo not performing the condition of pardon, have neither the pardon of that ſin, nor of any other which were conditionally pardoned to them.</p>
                     <p>If this Doctrine be the avoiding the good known way, there is a good known way beſides that which is revealed in the Goſpel: And if this be ſo hard a point for you to receive, I bleſs God, it is not ſo to me. And if it be far more eaſie to maintain one ſingle righteouſneſs, <hi>viz.</hi> imputed only; it will not prove ſo <hi>ſafe</hi> as <hi>eaſie.</hi> If one righteouſneſs may ſerve, may not <hi>Pilate</hi> and <hi>Simon Magus</hi> be juſtified, if no man be put to prove his part in it? and if he be, how ſhall he prove it, but by his performance of the conditions of the Gift.</p>
                     <p>Treat. <hi>pag.</hi> 232. <hi>Argu.</hi> 8. <hi>That cannot be a condition of Juſtification, which it ſelf needeth Juſtification: But good works being imperfect, and having much droſs cleaving, need a Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication to take that guilt away.</hi>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt Again, hearken all you that have ſo long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed the Covenant to have any conditions at all: Here is an Argument to maintain your cauſe: for it makes as much againſt
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:60968:80"/>
faith as any other acts (which they call works) for faith is imperfect alſo, and needs Juſtification, (a pardon I ſuppoſe you mean; I had rather talk of <hi>pardoning</hi> my ſins, then <hi>juſtifying</hi> them, or any imperfections what ever.)</p>
                     <p>Secondly, But indeed its too groſs a ſhift to help your cauſe. The Major is falſe, and hath nothing to tempt a man to believe it that I can ſee. Faith and Repentance are conſiderable. Firſt, As ſincere. Secondly, As imperfect: They are not the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of pardon as <hi>imperfect,</hi> but as <hi>ſincere.</hi> God doth not ſay <hi>[I will pardon you if you will not perfectly believe,]</hi> but <hi>[If you will believe.]</hi> Imperfection is ſin: and God makes not ſin a condition of pardon and life. I am not able to conceive what it was that in your mind could ſeem a ſufficiennt reaſon for this Propoſition, that <hi>nothing can be a condition that needs a pardon.</hi> Its true, that in the ſame reſpect as it needs a pardon; that is, as it is a ſin, it <hi>can be no condition. But faith as faith, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance as Repentance is no ſin.</hi>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> The clean contrary is true, as of Juſtification in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and as among men, ordinarily. The action is firſt accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable, or juſtifiable, and ſo the perſon as the cauſe of that Action. But in our Juſtification by Chriſts ſatisfaction, our Actions are not juſtifiable at all, ſave only that we have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the condition of the Gift that makes his righteouſneſs ours.</p>
                     <p>Treat. <hi>pag.</hi> 233. <hi>This queſtion therefore is again and again to be propounded: If good works be the condition of our Juſtification, how comes the guilt in them that deſerveth condemnation to be done away?

to all; This condition is firſt a duty, and then a condition. As a duty we perform it imperfectly and ſo ſinfully: for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of it is a duty, but the perfection is not the condition, but the ſincerity. Sincere Repentance and faith is the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the pardon of all our ſins: therefore of their own Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections, which are ſins. Will you ask now [<hi>If faith be imperfect, how comes the guilt of that Imperfection to be pardoned? is it by a further condition, and ſo</hi> in infinitum?] No: it is on tht ſame condition: ſincere repentance and faith are the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a pardon for their own Imperfections. Is there any difficulty in this, or is there any doubt of it? Why may not faith be a condition, as well as an Inſtrument of receiving the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of its own Imperfection? I hope ſtill you perceive that you put theſe queſtions to others as well as me, and argue againſt the common Judgement of Proteſtants, who make that which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, to be the condition of pardon. [<hi>Repent and be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized</hi> (ſaith <hi>Peter</hi>) <hi>for the remiſſion of ſin;</hi> Of what ſin? is any excepted to the Penitent Believer? certainly no: It is of all ſins. And is not the imperfection of faith and repentance a ſin? The ſame we ſay of ſincere obedience as to the continuance of our Juſtification, or the not loſing it, and as to our final Juſtification. If we ſincerely obey, God will adjudge us to ſalvation, and ſo juſtifie us by his final ſentence, through the blood of Chriſt from all the imperfections of that obedience: what need therefore of running any further towards an <hi>infinitum?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Treat. <hi>ibid. The Popiſh party and the Caſtellians are ſo far convinced of this, that therefore they ſay our good works are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. And</hi> Caſtellio <hi>makes that prayer for pardon not to belong to all the godly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> It ſeems they are partly Quakers. But they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy ſouls, if ſuch an Argument could drive them to ſuch an abominable opinion. And yet if this that you affirm, be the cauſe, that Papiſts have taken up the doctrine of perfection, I have more hopes of their recovery then I had before; nay, becauſe they are ſome of them men of ordinary capacities, I take it as if it were done already. For the Remedy is moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious;
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:60968:81"/>
Underſtand, Papiſts, that it is Faith and Repentance and Obedience to Chriſt in Truth, and not in Perfection that is the Condition of your final Juſtification at Judgement, and you need not plead for perfection any more. But I hardly believe you, that this is the cauſe of their error in this point.</p>
                     <p>And you may ſee that if Proteſtants had no more Wit then Papiſts, they muſt all be driven by the violence of your Argument, to hold that Faith and Repentance are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
                     <p>And ſeeing you tell us of <hi>Caſtellio</hi>'s abſurdity, I would intreat you to tell us, why it is that you pray for pardon your ſelves; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you take <hi>Prayer</hi> to be <hi>Means</hi> to obtain pardon, or you do not: If not, then 1. Pardon is <hi>none</hi> of your end in praying for pardon. 2. And then if once it be taken for no means, men cannot be blamed if they uſe it but accordingly. But if you do uſe it as a means, then what means is it? Is Prayer any cauſe of Pardon? ſay ſo, and you ſay more then we that you condemn, and fall under all thoſe cenſures that <hi>per fas aut nefas</hi> are caſt upon us. If it be no cauſe of pardon; Is it a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition <hi>ſine qua non,</hi> as to that manner of pardoning that your prayer doth intend? If you ſay yea, you conſequentially recant your diſputation (or Lecture) and turn into the tents of the Opinioniſts. But if it be no condition of pardon, then tell us what means it is if you can. If you ſay, it is a duty. I anſwer, Duty and Means are commonly diſtinguiſhed, and ſo is <hi>neceſſitas praecepti &amp; medii.</hi> Duty as ſuch, is no means to an end, but the bare reſult of a command. Though all Duty that God commandeth is alſo ſome means, yet that is not <hi>qua</hi> Duty. And ſo far as that Duty is a means, it is either a <hi>Cauſe,</hi> (near or remote) or a <hi>Condition,</hi> either of the obtainment of the benefit, ſimply, or of the more certain, or ſpeedy, or eaſie attainment of it, or of obtaining ſome inferiour good, that conduceth to the main. So that ſtill it is a Cauſe or a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, if a means. If you ſay, It is an <hi>Antecedent.</hi> I ſay, <hi>qua tale,</hi> that is no means, but if a <hi>Neceſſary</hi> antecedent, that which is the reaſon of its neceſſity may make it a means. If you go to Phyſical prerequiſites (as you talkt of a mans ſhoulders bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:60968:82"/>
the head that he may ſee, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) you go <hi>extra oleas</hi>; Its a moral means that we treat of, and I think you will not affirm Prayer to be a means of phyſical neceſſity to pardon. If it were, it muſt be a Phyſical cauſe, near or remote, or a <hi>Diſpoſitio materiae</hi> of natural neceſſity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If you ſay, that prayer for pardon, is <hi>diſpoſitio ſubjecti,</hi> I anſwer, thats it that we Opinioniſts do affirm: But it is a <hi>diſpoſitio moralis,</hi> and neceſſary <hi>ut medium ad finem</hi>: and that neceſſity muſt be conſtituted by the Promiſer or Donor: and that can be only by his <hi>modus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſionis,</hi> which makes it in ſome meaſure or other a condition of the thing promiſed. So that there is no lower moral <hi>medium</hi> then a meer condition <hi>ſune qua non,</hi> that my underſtanding can hitherto find out, or apprehend.</p>
                     <p>Treat <hi>ibid.</hi> Paul <hi>Judgeth them dung and droſs in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to Juſtification; yea all things,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. But what are thoſe <hi>All things?</hi> 2. And what <hi>Reference</hi> to Juſtification is it? If <hi>All things</hi> ſimply in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to Juſtification, then he muſt judge the <hi>Goſpel</hi> dung and droſs as to the Inſtrumental collation of Juſtification; and the Sacraments dung and droſs as to the ſealing of it; and the Miniſtry dung and droſs, as to the preaching and offering it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching men to be reconciled to God: and Faith to be dung and droſs, as to the receiving of it; as well as Repentance and Faith to be dung and droſs as conditions of it; or Prayer, Obedience, as conditions of continuing it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Its evident in the text that <hi>Pauls</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>All things</hi> that ſtand in oppoſition to Chriſt, and that ſtand in competition with him, as ſuch; and not of any thing that ſtands in a neceſſary ſubordination to him as ſuch.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. He expreſly addeth in the text, <hi>[for the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus my Lord]</hi> this therefore is none of the [<hi>all things</hi> that are <hi>dung</hi>] for the <hi>All things</hi> are oppoſed to this. And it containeth that faith, which is <hi>works</hi> with the Opponents: for this is more then a recumbency on Chriſt as Prieſt: It is the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of him as <hi>Lord</hi> alſo. I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent I ſhall never learn to expound <hi>Paul</hi> thus <hi>[I eſteem All

                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. It is not only in <hi>reference</hi> to <hi>Juſtification</hi> that <hi>Paul</hi> deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth <hi>All things</hi>; but it is to the <hi>winning</hi> of Chriſt (who doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs is the Principle of Sanctification as well as Juſtification) and to be <hi>found in him,</hi> which containeth the ſum of his felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

                     <p>Treat. pag. 234, 235. <hi>Others would avoid this Objection, by ſaying, that Goſpel graces, which are the Conditions of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, are reducible to the Law, and ſo Chriſt in ſatisfying the Law, doth remove the imperfections cleaving to them. And they judge it abſurb to ſay, that Chriſt hath ſatisfied for the ſins of the ſecond Covenant, or breaches, which is ſaid to be only final un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief.</hi>

Indeed as it was in a large ſenſe diſcovered to the Jews, being the Covenant of Grace, as I have elſewhere pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> (Vindic. Legis) <hi>ſo it required Juſtifying Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. But take, it in the ſenſe as the</hi> Abettor <hi>of this opinion muſt do, juſtifying faith and repentance muſt be called the works of the Law.</hi>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Its eaſilier called <hi>Legion</hi> then faithfully reported, or ſolidly confuted. 1. Let the Reader obſerve how much I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd the diſpleaſure of Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> for denying the Moral Law to be the ſufficient or ſole Rule of all duty, and how much he hath ſaid againſt me therein; and then judge how hard a task it is to pleaſe all men: when theſe two neighbours and friends, do publikely thus draw me ſuch contrary waies, and I muſt be guilty of more then ordinary errour whether I ſay <hi>Yea</hi> or <hi>Nay.</hi> And yet (which is the wonder) they differ not among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But ſeeing your ends direct you to fetch in his contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, ſo impertinent to the reſt, its requiſite that the Abettor do better open his opinion, then you have done, that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may not have a Defence of he knows not what.</p>
                     <p>My opinion ſo oft already explained in other writings, is this.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That the Law of Nature as continued by the Mediator, is to be diſtinguiſhed from the Remedying Law of Grace, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the New Teſtament, the Promiſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (Whether you will call them two Laws, or two parts of one Law, is little co the purpoſe; ſeeing in ſome reſpect they are two, and in ſome but one.)</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That this continued Law of Nature hath its Precept and Sanction, or doth conſtitute the Dueneſs, 1. Of Obedience in general to all that God hath commanded or ſhall command.
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:60968:83"/>
2. And of many duties in particular. 3. And of everlaſting death as the penalty of all ſin. So that it ſaith, <hi>The wages of ſin is death.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. That to this is affixed the Remedying Law of Grace, like an act of Oblivion, which doth 1. Reveal certain points to be believed. 2. And command the belief of them, which other particular duties in order to its ends. 3. And doth offer Chriſt, and Pardon, and Life, by a Conditional Donation en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting that whoſoever will Repent and Believe ſhall be Juſtified, and perſevering therein with true obedience, ſhall be finally ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged to everlaſting life, and poſſeſſed thereof. Its tenor is, He that Repenteth and Believeth ſhall be ſaved, and he that; doth not ſhall be damned.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That the ſenſe of this Promiſe and Threatning is, <hi>He that Repenteth and Believeth at all in this life, though but at the laſt hour, ſhall be ſaved; and he that doth it not at all ſhall be damned.</hi> Or <hi>he that is found a penitent Believer at death,</hi> &amp;c. And not, he that believeth not to day or to morrow ſhall be damned, though afterward he do.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That the threatning of the Law of Nature was not at firſt Peremptory and Remedileſs; and that now it is ſo far Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medyed, as that there is a Remedy at hand for the diſſolving of the Obligation, which will be effectual as ſoon as the Condition is performed.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. That the Remedying Law of Grace, hath a peculiar pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty, that is, 1. Non-liberation, A privation of Pardon and life which was offered (For that's now a penal privation, which if there had been no Saviour, or Promiſe, or Offer, would have been but a Negation.) 2. The certain Remedileſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their miſery for the future, that there ſhall be no more ſacrifice for ſin. 3. And whether alſo a greater degree of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, I leave to conſideration.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. I ſtill diſtinguiſhed between the Precepts and the Sanction of the Law of Grace or New Covenant, and between ſin as it reſpecteth both: And ſo I ſaid, that Repentance and Faith in Chriſt (even as a means to Juſtification) are commanded <hi>in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie</hi> in the Goſpel, which conſtituteth them duties, but command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed conſequently <hi>in genere</hi> in the Law of nature under the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:60968:84"/>
of Obedience to all particular precepts: and whether al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Law of Nature require the duty <hi>in ſpecie,</hi> ſuppoſing God to have made his ſupernatural preparations in providing and propounding the objects, I left to enquiry. Accordingly I affirmed that Impenitency and Infidelity, though afterward Repented of, as alſo the Imperfections of true faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, are ſins againſt the General precept of the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the ſpecial precept of the Law of Grace, and that Chriſt dyed for them, and they are pardoned through his blood, upon condition of ſincere Repentance and Faith.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Accordingly diſtinguiſhing between the reſpect that ſin hath to the precept and prohibition on one ſide, and to the promiſe and threatning on the other, I affirmed, that the foreſaid Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency and Infidelity that are afterwards repented of, and the Imperfections of true Faith and Repentance are condemned by the Remediable threatning of the Law of Nature only, and that the perſon is not under the Actual obligation of the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Threatning of the Law of Grace; that is, that though as to the Goſpel <hi>Precept,</hi> theſe ſins may be againſt the Goſpel as well as the Law, yet as to the <hi>Threatning,</hi> they are not ſuch violations of the New Covenant, as bring men under its actual curſe; for then they were remedileſs. And therefore I ſaid, that its only final Impenitency and Unbelief, as final, that ſo ſubjects men to that Curſe or Remedileſs peremptory ſentence. The reaſon is, becauſe the Goſpel maketh Repenting and Believing at any time before death, the Condition of promiſed pardon: and therefore if God by death make not the contrary impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency and unbelief final, it is not that which brings a man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Remedileſs Curſe; (except only in caſe of the Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt, which is ever final.)</p>
                     <p n="9">9 Accordingly I affirm that Chriſt never bore, or intended to bear the peculiar Curſe of his own Law of Grace. 1. As not ſuffering for any mans final impenitency and unbelief, which is proved in his Goſpel conſtitution, which giveth out pardon only on Condition of Faith and Repentance: and therefore the non-performance of his Condition is expreſly excepted from all pardon, and conſequently from the intended ſatisfaction, and price of pardon. 2. In that he did not bear that <hi>ſpecies</hi> of
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:60968:84"/>
puniſhment, as peculiarly appointed by the Goſpel, <hi>viz.</hi> To be denyed Pardon, Juſtification and Adoption, and to be Remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in miſery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="10">10. Alſo I ſaid, that all other ſins are pardonable on the Goſpel Conditions; but the non-performance (that is, final) of thoſe Conditions is everlaſtingly unpardonable (and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently no ſin pardoned for want of them.)</p>
                     <p>Reader, this is the face of that Doctrine which Reverend Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren vail over with the darkneſs and confuſion of theſe Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral words; that I ſay, <hi>[Chriſt hath not ſatiſfied for ſins againſt the ſecond Covenant.]</hi> And all theſe explications I am fain to trouble the world with, as oft as they are pleaſed to charge me in that confuſion. But what remedy? This is the Legion of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and contradictions; which I leave to thy impartial judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to abhor them as far as the Word and Spirit ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince thee that they are erroneous, and to bleſs thoſe Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations and Countries that are taught to abhor them, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in their felicity that believe the contrary.</p>
                     <p>Treat. pag. 235. 2. <hi>If ſo, then the works of the Law are Conditions of our Juſtification, and thus he runneth into the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream he would avoid.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The works which the Law requireth to Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that is, perfect obedience, are not the Conditions of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. 2. Nor the fulfilling of the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law of Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. But from among duties in general required by the Moral Law, after the ſpecial Conſtitution of the Goſpel, God hath choſen ſome to be the Conditions of life. And if you believe not this, I refer you to Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> who will undertake to prove more.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But your aſſertion is groundleſs. I ſaid not that they are works of the Law. What if the Law condemn the neglect of a Goſpel duty? Do I call the duty, a work of the Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I ſay the Law condemneth the neglecters of it?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But are you indeed of the contrary opinion, and againſt that which you diſpute againſt? Do you think that the Law doth not threaten unbelievers, when the Goſpel hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:60968:85"/>
faith? Have I ſo much ado to perſwade the men of your party, that the Goſpel hath any peculiar threatning or penalty, and that it is truly a Law (which the <hi>Lutherans</hi> have taught too many) and now do you think that its only the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel that Curſeth impenitent unelievers, and that maketh puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due for the remnant of theſe ſins in penitent Believers? Let the Reader judge who runneth into extreams and ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.</p>
                     <p>Treat. ib. <hi>But above all, this is not to be endured, that Chriſt hath not ſuffered for the breaches of the New Covenant, and that there is no ſuch breach but final impenitency: For are the defects of our Repentance, faith and love in Chriſt, other then the partial breaches of the Covenant of Grace? our unthankfulneſs, unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, yea ſometimes with</hi> Peter, <hi>our grievous revolts and apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; What are thoſe but the ſad ſhakings of our Covenant-intereſt, though they do not diſſolve it? But it is not my purpoſe to fall on this, becauſe of its impertinency to my matter in hand.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> I rather thought it your purpoſe to fall upon it, though you confeſs it impertinent to your matter in hand. For I thought you had <hi>purpoſed</hi> before you had <hi>Printed</hi> of <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Reader, I ſuppoſe thee one that hath no pleaſure in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and therefore wouldſt ſee this intolerable errour bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced. To which end, beſides what is ſaid before, underſtand, 1. That I uſe to diſtinguiſh between a threefold breach of the Covenant. 1. A ſin againſt a meer <hi>precept</hi> of the Goſpel, which precept may be Synecdochically called the Covenant. 2. A ſin againſt our <hi>own Promiſe</hi> to God when we Covenant with him. 3. A violation of Gods conſtitution, <hi>[Believe and be ſaved, and he that believeth not ſhall be damned]</hi> making us the proper ſubjects of its Actual Curſe or Obligation to its peculiar pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. 2. On theſe diſtinctions I uſe to ſay as followeth; 1. That Chriſt ſuffered for our breaches of Goſpel precepts. 2. And for our breaches of many promiſes of our own to God. 3. And for our temporary non-performance of the Goſpel Conditions, which left us under a non-liberation for that time,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:60968:85"/>
(and therefore we had no freedom from ſo much as was execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.) 4. But not for ſuch violation of the New Covenant, or Law of Grace, as makes us the actual ſubjects of its Curſe or Obligation to Remedileſs puniſhment. Theſe are my uſual limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and explications. And do I need to ſay any more now in defence of this opinion, which my Reverend Brother ſaith is not to be endured? 1. Is it a clear and profitable way of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to confound all theſe, under the general name of Covenant-breaking? 2. Or is it a comfortable Doctrine, and like to make Congregations bleſſed, that our defects of repentance, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfulneſs, and unthankfulneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are ſuch violations of the Law of Grace, or the Conditions of the Goſpel, as bring us under its actual obligation to Remedileſs puniſhment? That is, in plain Engliſh, to ſay, We ſhall all be damned.</p>
                     <p>Treat. ib. Argument 9. <hi>If works be a condition of our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, then muſt the godly ſoul be filled with perpetual doubts, and troubles, whether it be a perſon juſtified or no. This doth not follow accidentally through mans perverſneſs from the fore-named Doctrine: but the very</hi> Genius <hi>of it tends thereunto. For if a Condition be not performed, then the mercy Covenanted cannot be claimed: As in faith; if a man do not believe, he cannot ſay, Chriſt with his benefits are his. Thus if he have not works, the Condition is not performed, but ſtill he continueth without this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit. But for works; How ſhall I know when I have the full number of them? Whether is the Condition of the</hi> ſpecies <hi>or</hi> indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduums <hi>of works? Is not one kind of work omitted when its my duty, enough to invalidate my Juſtification? Will it not be as dangerous to omit that one as all, ſeeing that one is required as a Condition?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Your Argument is an unproved Aſſertion, not having any thing to make it probable. 1. Belief in Chriſt as Lord and Teacher, is <hi>Works</hi> with the Opponents. Why may not a man know when he believeth in Chriſt as King and Prophet, and is his Diſciple, as well as when he believeth in him as Prieſt?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Repentance is <hi>Works</hi> alſo with the Opponents. Why may not a man know when he Repenteth, as well as when he belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="148" facs="tcp:60968:86"/>3. Do you not give up the Proteſtant cauſe here to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts in the point of certainty of ſalvation? We tell them that we may be certain that our faith is ſincere. And how? why by its fruits and concomitants, and that we take Chriſt for Lord as well as Saviour, or to ſave us from the power of ſin as well as the guilt? And is it now come to that paſs that theſe cannot be known? What not the ſigns by which faith it ſelf ſhould be known, and therefore ſhould be <hi>notiora?</hi> This it is to eye man, and to be ſet upon the making good of an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Let all Proteſtants anſwer you, and I have anſwered you. <hi>How will they know when they Repent and Believe, when they have performed the full of theſe? believed all neceſſary Truths? Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of all ſins that muſt be Repented of? Whether it be the</hi> ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies <hi>or individual acts of theſe that are neceſſary! Will not the omiſſion of Repentance for one ſin invalidate it? Or the omiſſion of many individual acts of faith? are not thoſe acts conditions?</hi> &amp;c. Anſwer theſe, and you are anſwered.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. But I ſhall anſwer you briefly for them and me. Its no impoſſible thing to know when a man ſincerely believeth, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penteth and obeyeth, though many Articles are Eſſential to the Aſſenting part of faith, and many ſins muſt be Repented of, and many duties muſt be done. God hath made known to us the Eſſentials of each. It is not the Degree of any of them, but the Truth that is the Condition. A man that hath imperfect Repentance, Faith and Obedience, may know when they are ſincere, notwithſtanding the imperfections. Do you not believe this? Will you not maintain it againſt a Papiſt when you are returned to your former temper? what need any more then to be ſaid of it?</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Your Argument makes as much againſt the making uſe of theſe by way of bare ſigns, as by way of Conditions. For an unknown ſign is no ſign to us.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. And how could you over-look it, that your Argument flyeth too boldly in the face of Chriſt, and many a plain Text of Scripture? Chriſt ſaith, John 15.10. <hi>If ye keep my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, ye ſhall abide in my love, even as I have kept,</hi> &amp;c. 14. <hi>Ye are my friends, if ye do whatſoever I command you,</hi> Mat.

7.21. <hi>Not every one that ſaith Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdom of heaven, but he that doth the will of my Father which is in heaven.</hi> 23, 24. <hi>Whoſoever heareth theſe ſayings of mine, and doth them,</hi> &amp;c. Mat. 5. throughout. verſe 20. <hi>Except your righteouſneſs exceed the righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, ye ſhall in no caſe enter into the Kingdom of heaven.</hi> 1 John 3.10. <hi>In this the children of God are manifeſt, and the children of the Devil: whoſoever doth not righteouſneſs is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.</hi>] An hundred ſuch paſſages might be cited. And will you meet all theſe with your objections, and ſay, [<hi>How ſhall I know when I have the full number?</hi> &amp;c.] Know that you have <hi>ſincere</hi> Faith, Repentance and Obedience, and you may know you perform that Condition of the Goſpel: elſe not.</p>
                     <p>Treat. pag. 236. <hi>That if good works be a Condition of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, then none are juſtified till their death; becauſe in every good work is required perſeverance, in ſo much that perſeverance is that to which the promiſe is made,</hi> Mat. 24.6. Heb. 10.38. Rev. 2.7, 20. <hi>So that it is not good works ſimply, but perſevered in that is required: and therefore no Juſtification to the end of our daies, ſo that we cannot have any peace with God till then. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth it avail to ſay, Juſtification is not compleat till then; for it cannot be at all till then, becauſe the Condition that gives life to all is not till then.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. And is not perſeverance in faith as neceſſary as perſeverance in obedience? Read <hi>Col.</hi> 1.23. <hi>John</hi> 15.2, 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and many the like, and judge. Will you thence infer that none are juſtified till death?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But a little ſtep out of the darkneſs of your Confuſion, will bring the fallacy of your Argument to the light, and there will need no more to it. The Goſpel conveyeth to us ſeveral benefits: ſome without any Condition, and ſeveral benefits on ſeveral Conditions. 1. Our firſt Actual pardon and Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and right to life, is given on Condition of our firſt Faith and Repentance: and not on Condition of External works of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, nor yet of the perſevering in faith it ſelf, much leſs in that
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:60968:87"/>
Obedience. 2. Our ſtate of Juſtification is continued on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the continuance of Faith and Repentance, with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Obedience. 3. Our particular following ſins have a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular pardon, on Condition of the Continuance of the habits and renewing of the acts of that faith and repentance, for known obſerved ſins. 4. Our full Juſtification by Sentence at Judgement, is on the ſame condition as Glorification, <hi>viz.</hi> On perſeverance in Faith, Repentance, Hope, Love and ſincere Obedience.</p>
                     <p>Prove now if you can that perſeverance is the Condition of our firſt pardon. Prove if you can that final perſeverance is the Condition of our continuance in a juſtified ſtate till now. You ſay, Juſtification and peace cannot be ours till the condition be performed. But what condition? of that gift? or of another gift? If of that, its granted: but its ſtill denyed that perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is any of the Condition of our firſt pardon? If of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gift; its no reaſon of your Conſequence. If you ſpeak of final Juſtification and Salvation, I grant you all thus far, that you have no full Right of poſſeſſing them but on perſeverance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor no Right at all, or certainty of Salvation, but on ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of perſeverance as neceſſary to the poſſeſſion. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if you can prove that we have no certainty of perſeverance, I will yield that we have no certainty of ſalvation.</p>
                     <p>Treat. <hi>Thus we have aſſerted this truth by many Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and though any one ſingly by it ſelf may not convince, yet altogether may ſatisfie — Now to the great Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> —</p>

If you may ſay as a Grammarian and a Logitian, when you meet with ſuch words in Scripture, [Theſe are Paronyma, and theſe Synonyma, and theſe Homonyma, and this is an univerſal, that a ſingular, that a particular, and that an indefinite; this is an efficient cauſe, that a material, formal or final; this is a noun, that a verb, the other a

Is this adding to the Scripture unjuſtly? If I did, when ever I read that we are juſtified <hi>by</hi> faith, collect thence that faith is an Inſtrumental cauſe, as if <hi>by</hi> were only the note of an Inſtrument, then you might have accuſed me of unwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table addition, or collections, indeed.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, If you have a mind to it, I am content that you ſay by the unſcriptural names (or additions as you ſpeak) of nouns, pronouns, verbs, antecedents, conſequents, efficient, or mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial cauſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and I will lay by the name of a condition, as you do of an Inſtrument: and we will only uſe the Scripture phraſe, which is, <hi>If you forgive men, your Father will forgive you; if we confeſs our ſins, he is faithfull and juſt to forgive: we are juſtified by faith without the works of the Law: A man is juſtified by works, and not by faith only: By thy Words thou ſhalt be juſtified. Every man ſhall be judged according to his works,</hi>] &amp;c. Let us keep to Scripture phraſe if you deſire it, and you ſhall find me as backward as any to lay much ſtreſs upon terms of Art.</p>
                     <p>Having gone thus far, I ſhall in brief give you a truer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>James</hi> then you here offer us. 1. They debate different queſtions. 2. And that with different ſorts of perſons. 3. And ſpeak directly of different ſorts of works. 4. And ſomewhat differ in the ſenſe of the word Faith. 5. And ſomwhat about the word Juſtification. 6. And they ſpeak of works in ſeveral Relations to Juſtification.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Queſtion that <hi>Paul</hi> diſputed was principally Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Juſtification be by the works of the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law, and conſequently by any mercenary works, without Chriſt, or in Co-ordination with Chriſt, or any way at all conjunct with Chriſt? The queſtion that <hi>James</hi> diſputed, was, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men are juſtified by meer believing without Goſpel-Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The perſons that <hi>Paul</hi> diſputed againſt, were, 1 The unbelieving <hi>Jews,</hi> that thought the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law was of
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:60968:89"/>
ſuch perfection to the making of men righteous, that there needed no other, much leſs ſhould it be abrogate. Where ſpecially note, that the righteouſneſs which the <hi>Jews</hi> expected by that Law, was not (as is commonly imagined) a righteouſneſs of ſinleſs obedience, ſuch as was required of <hi>Adam</hi>; but a mixt Righteouſneſs, conſiſting of accurate Obedience to the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law in the main courſe of their lives, and exact ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing according to that Law for the pardon of their ſins com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, (wherein they made expreſs confeſſion of ſin) ſo that theſe two they thought ſufficient to juſtifie, and lookt for the <hi>Meſſias</hi> but to free them from captivity, and repair their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And 2. <hi>Paul</hi> diſputed againſt falſe Teachers, that would have joyned theſe two together (the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, and Faith in Chriſt) as neceſſary to life.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>James</hi> diſputed againſt falſe Chriſtians, that thought it enough to ſalvation barely to believe in Chriſt, (or lived as if they ſo thought) its like miſunderſtanding <hi>Pauls</hi> Doctrine of Juſtification as many now do.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The works that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of directly, are the ſervices appointed by <hi>Moſes</hi> Law ſuppoſed to be ſufficient, becauſe of the ſuppoſed ſufficiency of that Law. So that its all one with him to be juſtified by the Law, and to be juſtified by works; and therefore he ofter ſpeaks againſt Juſtification by the Law expreſly, and uſually ſtileth the works he ſpeaks of, the works of the Law: yet by conſequence, and a parity of Reaſon, he may well be ſaid to ſpeak againſt any works imaginable that are ſet in oppoſition to Chriſt, or competition with him, and that are ſuppoſed meritorious, and intended as Mercenary.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks of no works, but Obedience to God in Chriſt, and that as ſtanding in due ſubordination to Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. By <hi>Faith</hi> in the Doctrine of Juſtification, <hi>Paul</hi> means our Aſſent to all the eſſential Articles of the Goſpel, together with our Acceptance of Jeſus Chriſt the Lord, as ſuch, and affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in him; that is, To be a Believer; and ſo to have faith, is with <hi>Paul,</hi> to be a Diſciple of Chriſt, or a Chriſtian: Though ſometime he ſpecially denominates that faith from one part of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:60968:89"/>
the object (the promiſe) ſometime from another (the blood of Chriſt) ſometime from a third (his obedience.) And in other caſes he diſtinguiſheth Faith from Hope and Charity: but not in the buſineſs of Juſtification, conſidering them as reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Chriſt and the ends of his blood.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>James</hi> by faith means a bare ineffectual Aſſent to the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion, ſuch as the Devils them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves had.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of Juſtification in its whole ſtate, as begun and continued. But <hi>James</hi> doth principally, if not only ſpeak of Juſtification as continued. Though if by works any underſtand a diſpoſition to work in faith, or conjunct with it (as Dr. <hi>Iackson</hi> doth) ſo his words are true of initial Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alſo.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The principal difference lyeth in the Relations of works mentioned. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of works as the immediate matter of a legal perſonal Righteouſneſs, in part or whole. But <hi>James</hi> ſpoak of Works, not as anſwering the Law, but as fulfilling the condition of the Goſpel, and implyed (as promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed or reſolved on) in our firſt believing, and ſo as ſubſervient to the Sacrifice, Merit and Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, as the avoiding of poiſon or dangerous meats (that may kill, though the conrtary cannot cure) is ſubſervient to the curing medicine of a Phyſician, and implyed in our taking him for our Phyſician at firſt.</p>
                     <p>And ſo much briefly to ſatiſfie you and the world of the Reaſons of my Diſſent from you, that I may not differ from ſo Dear and Reverend a Brother, without making it appear, that neceſſity did compel me.</p>
                     <p>That which I have paſſed over, being about the Inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of Faith, I ſhall ſpeak to, (if God will) together with Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> Reaſonings on that Subject, in another Diſputation.</p>
                     <p>

                        <p>I Received yours, which I acknowledge a Favour: but not ſo great as I expect. Your diſſent is ſo generally known, that I cannot but hope to know ſome of the Grounds of it. I hope you cannot ſo vehemently diſſent in points of ſuch Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and yet deny me a diſcovery of mine Error. The defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuch a work till you have wrote another Book, doth intimate what will be injurious to the Church, your ſelf
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:60968:93"/>
and me: If you intend to publiſh a Confutation, when I am dead, and deny me any help for conviction while I live. 1. The Church will loſe the fruit of my own Recantation. 2. And your ſelf, one part of the fruit of your Labor. 3. And I may dye in error unrecanted, and you (being now importuned for, your help) be guilty of it. If you did but know how gladly I would publiquely recant, you would not deny your help. You that would have ſo importuned me to deliberate, if you had known before, I hope will not deny your aſſiſtance for my recovery. I did not haſtily that I did. But though I wanted the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of conſulting you before, yet I hope it is not too late. I am confident if you know me, you are not ſo uncharitable as to think me uncurable. It is therefore your flat duty not to ſuffer ſin upon me. Let me therefore intreat you to ſend me one or two of your ſtrongeſt Arguments againſt ſome of the weightyeſt points in difference; and to anſwer mine. I know it is not an hours work with you to do that much; and I would beſtow twenty for you. If you ſuſpect that I will any way miſ-imploy your papers, you ſhall preſcribe me the Law therein your ſelf. Whether you will read <gap reason="foreign">

I thought it a greater novelty to ſay, <hi>Faith juſtifieth only or primarily as an Inſtrument,</hi> then to ſay, it <hi>juſtifieth as the Condition, which the free Lawgiver hath promiſed Juſtification upon.</hi> I knew it was no novelty to ſay, we muſt have a perſonal Righteouſneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that imputed: And I took it to be as old as the Goſpel, to ſay, that this conſiſteth in Faith and ſincere Obedience. I called it Evangelical, becauſe I trembled to think of having an inherent Righteouſneſs which the Law of works will ſo deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate. What you ſay of the <hi>[Efficacy of Obedience and Faith]</hi> I diſclaim both, as never coming into my thoughts: I acknowledge no <hi>efficiency</hi> as to <hi>Juſtification</hi> in either, but a <hi>bare conditionality.</hi> I aver confidently that I give no more to works, then our Divines ordinarily do, <hi>viz.</hi> to be a ſecondary <hi>part of the Condition of the new Covenant, and ſo of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as continued and conſummate, and of Glorification:</hi> only if I err, it is in giving leſs to Faith, denying it to be the <hi>Inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Cauſe of Juſtification,</hi> but only a condition.

Truly Sir I am little prejudiced againſt your Arguments; But had rather return into the common road then not, if I could ſee the Light of truth to guide me. I abhor affected ſingularity in Doctrine: therefore I intreat you again to defer no longer to vouchſafe me the fruit of one hours labour, which I think I may claim from your Charity and the Intereſt God hath given one member in another, and you ſhall hereby very much oblige to thankfulneſs</p>

                        <p>I Received your letter, and I returned ſome Anſwer by Mr. <hi>Bryan, viz.</hi> that now the daies growing longer and warmer, I ſhall be glad to take occaſion to confer with you mouth to mouth about thoſe things wherein we differ, for I conceive that to be a far more compendious way, then by letters, wherein any miſtake is not ſo eaſily rectified: I ſhall therefore be ready to give you the meeting at <hi>Bremicham</hi> any Thurſday you ſhall appoint that may be convenient with your health; that ſo by an amicable collation, we may find out the truth. In the mean
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:60968:94"/>
while I ſhall not wholly neglect your requeſt in your letter, but give you an hint at one of thoſe ſeveral Arguments that move me to diſſent from you; which although it be obvious, yet ſuch Arguments as moſt men pitch upon, have the greateſt ſtrength: and that is the peculiar and proper expreſſions the Scripture giveth to faith in the matter of Juſtification, and that when the Doctrine is purpoſely handled, as <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans.</hi> attributing it ſo to faith, as it excludes not the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, but the co-operation of any other. He doth ſo include faith, as that he doth exclude all works under any notion: for <hi>Abraham</hi> was then godly, and abounded in other Graces, yet the Apoſtle faſtens his Juſtification upon this: in ſo much that if a man would have deſired the Apoſtle to make a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between faith and other Graces, it could not have been done more evidently. As for the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> your ſence cannot be admitted to reconcile them, but rather makes that breach wider: the one ſaith, a Juſtification without works; you make Faith as well as works, though one primarily: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Orthodox both againſt <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Arminians,</hi> and <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> do ſweetly reconcile them. By the hint of this, I ſee a Letter cannot repreſent the vigor of an Argument. I ſhall only add one thing: we may hold Opinions, and diſpute them ſpeculatively in Books; but practically, and when we come to dye, we dare not make uſe of them. I know not how a godly man at his death can look upon his Graces as Conditions of the Covenant fulfilled by him; though the Grace of God and the Merits of Chriſt be acknowledged the procuring cauſe. The Papiſts alſo verbally come to that refuge: For how come the Imperfections in the Conditions to be pardoned, and conditions have a moral Efficiency? <hi>Raptim.</hi> But of theſe things more fully when I ſee you.</p>
                        <p>The Lord preſerve you an Inſtrument in his Church, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and ſanctifie all your parts and abilities for his Glory.</p>

                        <p>FOr the expreſſions of your love in your two Letters, and your offer to meet me for conference; I return you hearty thanks. But I told you of my weakneſs, which is ſo great that I am not able to travel, nor to diſcourſe to any purpoſe if I were with you: a few words do ſo ſpend me (except when I have a little eaſe, which fals out perhaps once in a moneth for a few hours unexpected) therefore I am reſolved to importune you once again, and if you now deny me, to ceaſe my ſuit. It is expected at <hi>London, Cambridge, &amp;c.</hi> that you write a confutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and you intimate your purpoſe to do ſo hereafter: which I will not diſſwade you from, ſo I might but ſee your Arguments, that before I dye, I might know whether I have erred, and not dye without repenting or recanting: and if I err not, that I might ſhew you my grounds more fully; And if you deny this requeſt to one that hath ſo even unmannerly importuned you, and yet purpoſe to do it, when I can neither be the better for it, nor defend my ſelf, you walk not by that Rule as I thought you did, nor do as you would be done by. But for my part, I have done my endeavour for information, and ſo have ſatisfied my own conſcience. For what ſhould I do? There is none in this Country that will attempt a convincing of me, by word or writing, nor for ought I hear, gainſay: and you are the neareſt from whom I may hope for it. In your laſt you overpaſs all the particulars almoſt touched in your former, and pitch on Juſtification by works. Where you mention <hi>Pauls</hi> attributing it to Faith, to which I have anſwered, and have no Reply. 1. Where you ſay <hi>Paul</hi> excludes the Co-operation of any other; I anſwer, So do I. And of Faith too I deny the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations as effective. 2. When you ſay, he excludes works under any notion, I anſwer. 1. Would I could ſee that proved. 2. Then how can <hi>James</hi> ſay true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. Then he excludes faith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the notion of an Inſtrument. 4. And Repentance under
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:60968:95"/>
the notion of a preparative, or condition. 5. But if you mean only that he excludes the co-operation, or efficiency of works, I yield as before. 6. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſly excludes only the works of the Law, that is, ſuch as are conſidered in oppoſition to Chriſt, or co-ordination as required by the Law of Works, and not ſuch as Chriſt himſelf enjoyneth in ſubordination to himſelf; ſo they keep that place of ſubordination. 7. <hi>Pauls</hi> Queſtion is, What is the Righteouſneſs which muſt denominate a ſinner juſt at the Bar of the Law? And this he ſaith is no Works (under any notion) no not Faith, but only Chriſts Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and ſo faith muſt be taken relatively: for certainly it is Chriſt, and not Faith that is that Righteouſneſs. Is not this all that our Divines ſay, or require? and ſo ſay I, over and over. But <hi>Paul</hi> doth not reſolve there [what is the Condition on which Chriſt makes over this Righteouſneſs of his?] ſo directly, but collaterally. 8. Or if you ſay he do: yet if <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeak of our firſt poſſeſſion of Juſtification, I ſay it is without, not only the operation, but the preſence of works, which is more then you ſay. 9. Or whether he ſpeak of begun, or continued Juſtification, I ſay we are juſtified without works in <hi>Pauls</hi> ſenſe: yea that they are not ſo much as a condition of the continuance of Juſtification. For works in <hi>Pauls</hi> ſenſe relate to the reward, as of debt, and not of Grace. As a man that works to yearn wages, as <hi>Paul</hi> plainly ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.4. To him that worketh, the Reward is not of Grace, but of Debt. Theſe works I diſclaim as ſinfull in their ends. But obeying the Goſpel, or being willing that Chriſt who hath redeemed us, ſhould rule over us, and running that we obtain, and fighting the good fight of faith, and ſuffering with Chriſt that we may be glorified with him, and improving our Talent, and enduring to the end, and ſo doing good works, and laying up a good foundation againſt the time to come: I think <hi>Paul</hi> excludes not any of theſe from being bare conditions, or <hi>cauſae ſine quibus non</hi> of our Juſtification at Judgement, or the continuance of it here. <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith excluded works in <hi>Pauls</hi> ſenſe, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but not works in this ſenſe, or in <hi>James</hi> his ſenſe. When you ſay my ſenſe for reconciling <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>James</hi> cannot be admitted. 1. I would you had told me what way to do it better:
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:60968:95"/>
and anſwered what I have ſaid in that. 2. Your reaſon appears to me of no ſeeming force. For firſt you ſay [the one ſaith a Juſtification by faith without works, you make Faith as well as works, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] <hi>Anſwer</hi> 1. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith not barely without works, but without the works of the Law. And I have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you what he means by works, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.4. 2. I ſay no more then <hi>James,</hi> that a man is juſtified by works, and not by faith on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: I believe both theſe Scriptures are true, and need no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling, as having no contradiction in the terms. And yet I ſpeak not ſo broad uſually, as <hi>James</hi> doth. Where you ſay that [the Orthodox do ſweetly reconcile them] I know not who you mean by the Orthodox. For I doubt not but you know the variety of interpretations to reconcile them. <hi>Piſcator</hi> and <hi>Pemble</hi> have one Interpretation, and way of Reconciliation. <hi>Calvin, Paraeus</hi> and moſt Divines another. <hi>Camero</hi> confuteth the beſt eſteemed, and hath another. <hi>Brochmond</hi> with moſt of the <hi>Lutherans</hi> have another. <hi>Jac. Laurentius, Althemor,</hi> and many more tell us of divers: which of theſe you mean by the Orthodox, I know not. But if you exclude all thoſe from the Orthodox, that ſay as I ſay in this, you will exclude as Learned Divines, and well reputed of, as moſt <hi>Europe</hi> hath bred, <hi>viz.</hi> excellent <hi>Conrad. Bergius, Ludov. Crecius, Johan, Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius, Johan. Bergius,</hi> &amp;c. Who though they all diſpute for Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by faith without works, underſtanding it of the firſt Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication (for moſt Divines have taken Juſtification to be rigidly <hi>ſimul &amp; ſemel</hi> till Dr. <hi>Downam</hi> evinced that it is a continued Act) yet they both take works for meriting works, that reſpect the reward as of Debt, and they ſay that otherwiſe Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is a Condition (or cauſe as they make it) of continuing, or not loſing Juſtification once attained. And is not that to ſay as much as I? And many more I can name you that ſay as much. And you approve of Mr. <hi>Bals</hi> book, which ſaith that <hi>works (or a purpoſe to walk with God) do juſtifie as a paſſive qualification of the Subject capable of Juſtification.</hi> You add that [<hi>we may diſpute,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but you know not how a godly man at his death can look on his Graces as Conditions of the Covenant fulfilled by him, &amp;c.</hi>] Which ſpeech ſeems ſtrange to me. I confeſs if I be ſo, I am ungodly. For I have been as oft, and as long in

the expectation of death as moſt men, and ſtill am: and yet I am ſo far from being afraid of this, that I ſhould live and dye in horror and deſperation, if I could not look upon the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Covenant of Grace fulfilled by my ſelf through goes workings. If by our Graces you mean Habits, I think it more improper to call them the fulfilling the conditions of the Covenant. For what you ſay of the Papiſts, you know how funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally almoſt they differ from me in this, confounding the Covenants Righteouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If it were not to one that knows it better then my ſelf, I would ſhew wherein. For your queſtion, How come the imperfections in our conditions to be pardoned? You know I have fully anſwered it, both in the Aphoriſms, and Appendix. And I would rather you had given me one diſcovery of the inſufficiency of that anſwer, then asked the Queſtion again. Briefly thus. Guilt is an obligation to puniſhment (as it is here to be underſtood) Pardon is a freeing from that Obligation, or Guilt and Puniſhment. All Puniſhment is due by ſome Law. According to the Law or Covenant of Works the imperfection of our Faith, Love, Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> deſerve puniſhment, and Chriſt hath ſatisfied that Law, and procured forgiveneſs of theſe imperfections, and ſo acquit us from Guilt and puniſhment. The new Law, or Covenant of Grace doth not threaten death to any but final Unbelievers, and ſo not to the imperfection of our Faith, Love, Obedience, where they are ſincere. And where the Law threatneth not Puniſhment, there is no obligation to Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (or Guilt) on the party from that Law, and ſo no work for Pardon. Imperfect believers perform the conditions of the new Covenant truly: and it condemneth none for imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of degree<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where there is ſincerity: No man is ever par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, whom the new Law condemneth, that is, final Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, or Rejecters of Chriſt. So that Chriſt removeth, or forgiveth that obligation to puniſhment, which by the Law of Works doth fall on us for our imperfections. And for the Law of Grace where it obligeth not to puniſhment, that obligation which is not, cannot be taken off: nor that man pardoned, that was never guilty. Your Queſtion occaſioneth me to be unmannerly in opening theſe eaſie things to you, that I doubt

What ever I was then thought by others, I confeſs I was ignorant, and am glad that God hath in any meaſure healed my ignorance, though with the loſs of my reputation of being Orthodox. Where you add that conditions have a moral effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, either you mean all or ſome; if all, or if this whereof we are in ſpeech, though I am loth to conteſt with you in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, yet I muſt confeſs I never read ſo much in any Author, nor can force my ſelf to believe it, <hi>Cauſa ſine qua non, eſt cauſa fatua.</hi> It is as <hi>Schibler</hi> and others, a meer Antecedent.

If you mean by moral efficiency any thing elſe which is indeed no efficiency, I ſtick not on meer words.</p>

Were it not then better to perſwade all people, even when they are whoring, or drunk, to truſt on Chriſt to pardon and juſtifie them? And then when they have the tree and cauſe, the fruits and ſignal effects will follow.</p>

                           <hi>Queſt.</hi> 24. Yea, Why do the beſt Divines preach ſo much againſt Preſumption? And what is Preſumption, if it be not this very faith which Divines call juſtifying? <hi>viz.</hi> the Truſting to Chriſt for Pardon and Salvation only, without taking him for their King and Prophet? If it be ſaid that this laſt muſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, though not juſtifie: How can the bare preſence of an idle Accident ſo make, or marr the efficacy of the cauſe?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Queſt.</hi> 25. If to be unwilling that Chriſt ſhould raign over us, be part of the directly condemning ſin, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.27. why is not the willingneſs he ſhould raign, part of ſaving, juſtifying faith?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Queſt.</hi> 26. Seeing reſting in Chriſt is no Phyſical apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of him (who is bodily in Heaven) nor of his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (which is not a being capable of ſuch an apprehenſion) How can that Reſting juſtifie more then any other Act, but only as it is the condition to which the Promiſe is made? Reſting on a friend for a Benefit, makes it not yours, but his gift does that. As <hi>Perkins</hi> (cited by me) <hi>To believe the Kingdom of France ſhall be mine, makes it not mine: But to believe Chriſt, and the Kingdom of Heaven, &amp;c. (vid. loc.</hi> where he ſaith as much as I) <hi>vol.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 662. If God had not ſaid <hi>[He that believeth ſhall be juſtified and ſaved,]</hi> would <hi>Believing</hi> have done it? And if he had ſaid, <hi>[He that repenteth, or loveth, or calleth on the name of the Lord, ſhall be juſtified or ſaved]</hi> would not theſe have done it? if ſo; then doth not faith juſtifie directly, as the condition of the Gift, Promiſe, or new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant?
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:60968:100"/>
And its <hi>apprehenſion</hi> is but its <hi>aptitude</hi> to be ſet apart for this Office: And if it juſtifie as a condition of the Promiſe: muſt not others do it ſo far as they are parts of the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>

                        <p>I Am ſorry that you are not in capacity for the motion I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered: I thought diſcourſe would not ſo much infeeble you, eſpecially when it would have been in ſo loving a way: And I judged it the more ſeaſable, becauſe I had been informed of a late ſolemn conference you had about <hi>Paedobaptiſm,</hi> which could not but much ſpend you, I ſhall preſs no more for it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this very letter doth abundantly confirm me, that let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are but a loſs of time: for one word might have prevented many large digreſſions. Is not that endeavour of yours in your ſeventh queſtion to prove out of my book, that Repentance is a neceſſary condition, or qualification in the Subject to be pardoned, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a meer impertinency? You earneſtly deſire ſatisfaction of your conſcience, therefore I cannot think you
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:60968:100"/>
do wilfully miſtake. For is that the ſtate of the queſtion with us? Is it not this, whether the Goſpel Righteouſneſs be made ours, otherwiſe then by believing? You ſay by believing, and Obedience. I ſay only believing. I ſay faith is only the condition juſtifying, or inſtrument receiving, you make a juſtifying Repentance, a juſtifying Patience: you make other acts of grace juſtifying as well: ſo that whereas heretofore, we only had juſtifying faith, now there are as many other qualities, and all juſtifying, as there are Graces. So that I do firmly hold (and it needs a recantation) that repentance and other exerciſes of Grace are antecedent qualifications, and are <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia ordinata,</hi> in the uſe whereof only pardon can be had. But what is this to you? Who expreſly maintain the righteouſneſs of the Covenant of Grace to be made ours, upon our godly working, as well as believing. If therefore you had ſpent your ſelf to ſhew that faith had no peculiar Inſtrumentality in our Juſtification, but what other Graces have, then you had hit the mark. What is more obvious, then that there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny conditions <hi>in juſtificato,</hi> which are not <hi>in actu juſtificationis</hi>? The faſtening of the head to the body is a neceſſary condition <hi>in homine vidente,</hi> but it is not <hi>in actu videntis.</hi> You grant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſome precedency to faith, but you make Faith and Works <hi>aequè,</hi> though not <hi>aequaliter,</hi> the conditions of Juſtification. I ſhould ſay much more to the ſtate of the queſtion, but I forbear. In other things you ſeem to come off; and though I do not ſay you recede from your Aſſertions, yet you much mollifie them, that I need not therein contend with you. But here is the ſtick. Let it be demonſtrated, that whereas the Scripture in the current of it attributes Juſtification to believing only: as <hi>through faith,</hi> and by <hi>Faith,</hi> and through <hi>faith in his blood,</hi> that you can as truly ſay, its received by love, and its through love of his blood ſhed for our ſakes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is a little of that much which might be ſaid to the ſtate of the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This I judge new Doctrine, juſtifying Repentance, juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Charity. And in my Letter I laid down an Argument, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. Concerning <hi>Abrahams,</hi> Juſtification, the Pattern of all others. To this you reckon up many Anſwers, but I ſee not the Argument ſhaken by it. Firſt you ſay, you <hi>exclude a co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:60968:101"/>
effective,</hi> but why do we ſtrive about words? You do not exclude <hi>works juſtifying,</hi> as well as faith, let the expreſſions be what they will. Whereas <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, he <hi>would be found ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Righteouſneſs which is by faith,</hi> you will add, <hi>and which is by love, by zeal.</hi> 2. You deſire <hi>it to be proved, that</hi> Paul <hi>excludes all works under any notion</hi>; I think its very eaſily done: Firſt, becauſe of the <hi>immediate oppoſition</hi> between Faith and Works; now you will contradict <hi>Pauls</hi> Argument, and give a <hi>tertium,</hi> works that are of Grace. But the Apoſtles oppoſition is ſo immediate here and in other places, between faith and any thing of ours, that he admits of no <hi>medium.</hi> 2. He inſtances in <hi>Abrahams</hi> works, and excludes them: now were <hi>Abrahams</hi> works, works done by the meer ſtrength of the Law? Did not <hi>Abrahams</hi> Obedience, and other works flow from Grace? Were <hi>Abrahams</hi> works in oppoſition to Chriſt? Yet even theſe are excluded. 3. He excludes all works under any notion by the oppoſition, juſtifying, covering, all is wholly attributed unto God. 4. The Aſſertion is univerſal: The Apoſtle ſaith, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out works in general, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. And he works not, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. Laſtly, By the teſtimony he brings from the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> that bleſſedneſs is where ſin is not imputed, whrere it is forgiven; Theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons do evidence that he excludes works under all notions in the act of Juſtification, though not from the perſon juſtified. 3. You ſay, <hi>how then ſaith</hi> James <hi>true</hi>? But I ask, if there be juſtifying works, how ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> true? But again, <hi>James</hi> ſaith true: for this faith which in reſpect of its act <hi>ad intra,</hi> doth only juſtifie, yet it works <hi>ad extra.</hi> The old Aſſertion is <hi>fides quae viva,</hi> not <hi>quo viva.</hi> You ſpeak of a ſeeming Antilogie among the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox in this reconciliation, but though all go not <hi>eadem ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

You ſay you acknowledge the Aſſemblies definition of reſting or receiving, you cannot take in that ſence, as they declare it, as the Scripture words which are Metaphorical, do imply: for its the reſting of a burdened ſoul upon Chriſt only for Righſeouſneſs, and by this Chriſts Righteouſneſs is made over to us; and its a receiving of Chriſt, as the hand embraceth any Object: now you make the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt made over to us in any other exerciſe of Grace as well as this. So that although you would willingly ſeem not to recede from others, yet you plainly do: and although you think your Aſſertions are but more diſtinct explications, yet they are indeed deſtructive Aſſertions to what our Divines do deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: neither may you, while you intend to diſpute, exactly build upon ſome homiletical or popular expreſsion in any mans book.</p>
                        <p>You reply to a ſecond part in my Letter: whether a godly man dying, may be affected according to your poſition, and thereupon you inſtance in <hi>Hezekiah, Paul,</hi> and that no man can dye with comfort without the evidence of theſe works. But is this the ſtate of the queſtion with us? Do you think that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a godly life to be a comfortable teſtimony, and a neceſſary qualification of a man for pardon? You cannot think that you
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:60968:102"/>
ſpeak to the point in this. But here is the queſtion, Can a godly man dying, think the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is made his by working or believing? Is it repent, and Chriſts Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is by this made yours, and reſt in Chriſt? Certainly the dying Chriſtian is in agonies directed to this reſting on Chriſt, to the eying of this brazen Serpent, not to be found in any thing but the Righteouſneſs by faith. Its an act of Dependance, not of Obedience that intereſts us in Chriſts Righteouſneſs. Its that puts on the robes of Chriſt, that our nakedneſs may not appear. And that is very harſh ſtill, which you expreſs, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the Righteouſneſs of the Covenant of Grace upon the conditions fulfilled by your ſe;lf, through Gods workings. I am unwilling to parallel this with ſome paſſages that might be quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of unſound Authors; but that I am confident, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever your Pen-writes, you have a <hi>tutiſſimum eſt</hi> to reſt only upon Chriſts Righteouſneſs, and that by bare reſting, and beleiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you look for a Righteouſneſs. As Philoſophers ſay, we ſee or hear <hi>intus recipiendo,</hi> not <hi>extra mittendo</hi>: otherwiſe <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> argues conſonantly enough, that Love would juſtifie as well as faith; but we ſay that <hi>Faith doth</hi> pati, <hi>Love doth</hi> agere.

                        <p>IF you doubt of the truth of my bodily infirmity, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you neither know my body nor mind. The diſpute at <hi>Bewdley,</hi> as it was almoſt at home, ſo I had the choice of the time, and ſuch ſtrength vouchſafed from God, which I cannot again expect, much leſs promiſe my ſelf. I told you I have ſome <hi>lucida intervalla,</hi> perhaps a few hours in a moneth: but if up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch uncertainty I ſhould draw you to a journey, and then ten to one fail you, I ſhould be injurious. But ſeeing you ſo far and freely condiſcend, if God wil ſhew me ſo much Mercy, as to enable this reſtleſs unceſſantly-pained <hi>Sceleton</hi> to ſuch a work, I ſhall be bold to ſend you word, and claim the favour you offer. In the mean time it is my duty to let you know, I have received your Letter, and to return your hearty thanks for it, though it be not that which I hoped for, and ſhall now ceaſe to expect. I am convinced now as well as you that Letters are but a loſs of time: but your Arguments or direct anſwers to my Queſtions, would have been for my advantage, a precious improvement of it: but ſeeing I may not be ſo happy, I muſt reſt content. It ſtill ſeemeth to my weak underſtanding to be no impertinency to prove that your ſelf affirm Repentance, Confeſsion, Turning, Forgiveing others, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> to be more then ſigns, <hi>i. e.</hi> to be conditions to qualifie the Subject to obtain forgiveneſs; and to tell you that I ſay no more, and to tell you ſtill, that you give more to faith (and ſo to man) then I; but I give no more to works for ought I deſcern then you; I am ſure then our ordinary Divines do: And if I do miſtake herein, you have little reaſon to ſuſpect me of willfulneſs; though of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as much as you pleaſe. As for the ſtate of the Queſtion between us, which you ſpeak of, I am a ſtranger to it, and know not what you mean. I never came to the ſtating of a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion with you; nor did you ſtate any to me in your letters, but mentioned your vehement diſſent from ſeveral paſſages in my book, and therefore I had reaſon to think that you fell upon the Queſtions as there they were ſtated; ſo that it is <hi>intime &amp; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dullitùs,</hi> pertinent to my queſtion, which is impertinent to yours.
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:60968:103"/>
You ſay the queſtion is, [<hi>Whether the Goſpel righteouſneſs be made ours otherwiſe then by believing</hi>?] and tell me that I ſay <hi>[by believing and obedience]</hi> when I never ſtated ſuch a queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor ever gave ſuch an anſwer. I ſuppoſe by <hi>[Goſpel Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs]</hi> you mean Chriſts Righteouſneſs given to Believers: Now I have affirmed that <hi>[thoſe only ſhall have part in Chriſts ſatisfaction, and ſo in him be legally righteous, who do believe and obey the Goſpel, and ſo are in themſelves Evangelically righteous.]</hi> But your phraſe <hi>[made ours]</hi> doth intimate that our firſt poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſts Righteouſneſs ſhould be upon Obedience as well as Faith; which I never affirmed: But Chriſts Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is <hi>continued</hi> ours on condition of obeying him, though not <hi>made</hi> ours ſo: and we ſhall be juſtified at Judgement alſo on that condition. As it is not marriage duty, but Contract which is the condition of a womans firſt Intereſt in her Husband and his riches; but marriage duty and the performance of that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, is the condition of her Intereſt as continued. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is much of my care in that Book to ſhun and avoid that queſtion which you ſay is ſtated between us: for I knew how much ambiguity is in the Word <hi>[By]</hi> which I was loth to play with. I know we are juſtified By God the Father, By Chriſts ſatisfaction, By Chriſts abſolution, By the Goſpel Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant or Promiſe, By the Sacraments, By Faith, By Works, (for I will never be aſhamed to ſpeak the words of the Holy Ghoſt) By our words (for ſo ſaith Chriſt) Therefore if you will needs maintain in general, that Chriſts Righteouſneſs is made ours, no otherwiſe then by beleiving, nor otherwiſe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ours; you ſee how much you muſt exclude. But to remove ſuch Ambiguity, I diſtinguiſh between juſtifying <hi>[By]</hi> as an efficient inſtrumental Cauſe, and <hi>[By]</hi> as by a condition: and I ſtill affirm that Works or Obedience do never juſtifie as any cauſe, much leſs ſuch a cauſe; but that by them as by a condition appointed by the free Lawgiver and Juſtifier we are finally juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. And truly Sir, it is paſt my reach at preſent to underſtand what you ſay leſs in this then I, except you differ only about the word <hi>[By],</hi> and not the ſence; and think that it is improper to ſay that Pardon or Juſtification is <hi>By</hi> that which is but a condition: You ſeem here to drive all at this, and yet me thinks
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:60968:103"/>
you ſhould not. 1. Becauſe you affirm your ſelf, that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have a moral efficiency: and then it ſeems when you ſay Repentance, Confeſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are conditions, you mean they are morally efficient; which is a giving more to works then ever I did. 2. Becauſe you know it is the phraſe of Chriſt and his Spirit, that we are juſtified <hi>By</hi> our words and works; and it is ſafe ſpeaking in Scripture phraſe. 3. Becauſe you ſay after that my Aſſertions are deſtructive of what Divines deliver: but the word <hi>By,</hi> if we are agreed in the ſence, cannot be deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive; and except the phraſe only <hi>By, &amp;c.</hi> be the difference, where is it? When you ſay Repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are conditions, and I ſay they are no more: and I have nothing from you of any diſagreement about the ſence of the word <hi>condition.</hi> Leſt you ſhould doubt of my meaning in that, I underſtand it as in our uſual ſpeech it is taken, and as Lawyers and Divines generally do, viz. <hi>Eſt Lex addita negotio, quae donec praeſtetur, eventum ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendit. Vel eſt modus, vel cauſa quae ſuſpendit id quod agitur, quoad ex poſt facto confirmetur, ut Cujacius.</hi> And whereas Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are uſually diſtinguiſht into <hi>poteſtativas, cauſales &amp; mixtas, ſeu communes,</hi> I mean <hi>conditiones poteſtativas.</hi> Where you add that you ſay only faith is the condition juſtifying. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but I make a juſtifying Repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And whereas heretofore we had only juſtifying faith, now, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] I anſwer, 1. If by juſtifying Repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you mean that which is (as you ſay Faith is) an inſtrument or efficient Cauſe, I never dreamed of any ſuch: If as a Condition; you confeſs it your ſelf. 2. If you ſpeak againſt the ſence, we are agreed in that for ought I know: If againſt the phraſe, then juſtifying Faith or Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is no Scripture phraſe: but to be juſtified By faith, and By works, and By words, are all Scripture phraſes.

If by the other exerciſes of Grace you mean the particulars in your book enumerated, or the like; and if by <hi>Pardon,</hi> you mean even the firſt pardon (as the word <hi>Only</hi> ſhews you do) then you go quite beyond me, and give far more to thoſe exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:60968:104"/>
of grace then I dare do. For I ſay that Chriſt and all his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Righteouſneſs, is made ours, and we pardoned and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied at firſt without any works or obedience more then bare faith, (and what is precedent in its place or concomitant) and that <hi>bona opera ſequuntur juſtificatum non praecedunt juſtifican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum,</hi> in regard of our firſt juſtification. I dare not ſay, they are Antecedents or <hi>media ordinata.</hi> Where you add, <hi>what is that to you that make the righteouſneſs of the Covenant of grace to be made ours upon our godly working.</hi> &amp;c. I anſwer, 1. I have ſhewed it is as much as I ſay, if not more, <hi>[upon]</hi> intending but a condition or <hi>medium ordinatum.</hi> 2. I never ſaid what you ſay I maintain in phraſe or ſenſe (if the word <hi>[made]</hi> intend either efficiency or any cauſality, or the firſt poſſeſſion of Righteouſneſs. 3. You much uſe the harſh phraſe of <hi>[working]</hi> as here <hi>[Godly working]</hi> as mine; which I doubt whether ever I uttered or uſed; And the term <hi>[works]</hi> I little uſe, but in the explication of <hi>James.</hi> For I told you that I diſclaim works in <hi>Pauls</hi> ſenſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.4. which make the reward not of grace, but of debt. You add <hi>[If therefore you had ſpent your ſelf to ſhew that faith hath no pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar inſtrumentality in our juſtification but what other graces have, then you had hit the mark.] Anſw.</hi> I confeſs Sir you now come to the point in difference. But do you not hereby confeſs that I give no more to works then you, but only leſs to faith? Why then do you ſtill harp upon the word <hi>[works]</hi> as if I did give more to them? the task you now ſet me is to prove that faith doth no more, and not that works do ſo much: That faith is not an inſtrument, and not that love or obedience are conditions. And to this I anſwer you: 1. I have in my book ſaid ſomewhat to prove faith no inſtrument of juſtifying, and you ſaid nothing againſt it. Why then ſhould I aim at this mark? 2. I think I have proved there that faith juſtifieth pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily and properly as the condition of the Covenant, and but remotely as <hi>A receiving juſtification,</hi> this which you call the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentality, being but the very formal nature of the act, and ſo the <hi>quaſi materia</hi> or its aptitude to the office of Juſtifying. And becauſe I build much on this ſuppoſition, I put it in the <hi>Queries,</hi> which you judge impertinent. 3. Yet if you will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the word <hi>inſtrument</hi> laxely, I have not any where
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:60968:104"/>
denyed faith to have ſuch an inſtrumentality (that is, receiving or apprehenſiveneſs) above other graces: Only I deny and moſt <hi>confidently</hi> deny that that is the formal, proper or neereſt cauſe of faith's juſtifying: But the formal reaſon is, becauſe God hath made it the condition of the Covenant, promiſing juſtification to ſuch receiving, which elſe would have no more juſtified then any other act: And therefore ſo far as others are made conditions, and the promiſe to us on them, they muſt needs have ſome ſuch uſe as well as faith: And that they are conditions, you confeſs as much as I. 4. But what if I be miſtaken in this point? what is the danger? If faith ſhould deſerve the name of an inſtrument, when I think it is but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition? 1. Is it any danger to give leſs to faith then others, while I give no leſs to Chriſt? (For if you ſhould think I gave leſs to Chriſt then others, I ſhould provoke you again and again to ſhew wherein) 2. I deny nothing that Scripture ſaith: It ſaith not that faith is an inſtrument: (perhaps you will tell me <hi>Veronius</hi> argues thus: But I mean it is neither in the letter nor plain ſenſe; and then I care not who ſpeaks it, if true.) 3. You make man an efficient cauſe of juſtifying himſelf. (For the inſtrument is an efficient cauſe): And what if I dare not give ſo much to man? is there any danger in it? or ſhould I be ſpoke againſt for the Doctrine of obedience, as <hi>if I gave more</hi> to man then you, when I give ſo much leſs? 4. Thoſe that diſſent from me do make the very natural act of faith, which is moſt eſſential to it, and inſeparable from it, as it from it ſelf, <hi>viz. Its apprehenſion of Chriſts Righteouſneſs,</hi> to be the proper primary reaſon of its juſtifying. What if I dare not do ſo, but give that glory to God, and not to the nature of our own act? and ſay, that <hi>Fides quae recipit Juſtificat, ſed non qua recipit</hi> primarily, but as it is the condition which the free juſtifier hath conferred this honour upon? is there any danger in this? and will there be joy in heaven for reducing a man from ſuch an opinion?</p>
                        <p>You ſay, [<hi>What more obvious then that there are many conditions in</hi> juſtificato, <hi>which are not</hi> in actu juſtificationis: <hi>The faſtning the head to the body, &amp;c.</hi>] Anſw. 1. You ſaid before that they are Antecedents <hi>&amp; Media ordinata,</hi> and then they are
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:60968:105"/>
ſure conditions <hi>in juſtificando</hi> as well as <hi>in juſtificato.</hi> 2. Your mention of the condition <hi>in homine vidente</hi> is <hi>beſides</hi> our buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and is only of a natural condition, or <hi>qualification in genere naturae</hi>; When we are ſpeaking only of an active con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition <hi>in genere moris</hi>: The former is improperly, the later properly called a condition. 3. If this be your meaning, I confeſs there are many natural or paſſive qualifications ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, which are no active or proper moral conditions in a Law-ſenſe; But this is nothing to the matter. 4. The phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of <hi>[Conditions in juſtificato, &amp; in actu juſtificationis]</hi> are am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous, and in the Moral ſenſe improper. Our queſtion is whether they are conditions <hi>ad juſtificationem recipiendam:</hi> Which yet in regard of time are <hi>in actu juſtificationis,</hi> but not <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditiones vel qualificationes ipſius actus.</hi> And if you did not think that repentance is a condition <hi>ad juſtificationem recipiendam,</hi> and ſo <hi>in actu juſtificationis,</hi> how can you ſay it is <hi>medium ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum? A medium,</hi> as ſuch, eſſentially hath ſome tendency or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducibleneſs to its end. 5. As obvious therefore as you think this is, it is paſt the reach of my dull apprehenſion to conceive of your conditions in a judiciary ſenſe, which are <hi>in juſtificato</hi> for the obtaining of juſtification, and not be both <hi>ad actum &amp; in actu juſtificationis:</hi> for I ſuppoſe you are more accurate and ſerious then by the word condition to mean <hi>modum vel affectionem entis Metaphyſicam, vel ſubjecti alicujus adjunctum vel qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem in ſenſe Phyſico,</hi> when we are ſpeaking only of conditions <hi>in ſenſu forenſi.</hi> And there are many thouſand honeſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans as dull as I, and therefore I do not think it can be any weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty point of faith which muſt be ſupported by ſuch ſubtilties which are paſt our reach, though obvious to yours: God uſeth not to hang mens ſalvation on ſuch School diſtinctions which few men can underſtand. 6. And every ſuch Tyro in Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy as I, cannot reach your Phyloſophical ſubtilty neither; to underſtand that the faſtning of the head to the body is not <hi>condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio in actu videntis</hi>; (though it be nothing to our purpoſe); Indeed we may think it of more remote uſe then ſome other, and but <hi>propter aliud, &amp; quaſi conditio conditionis</hi>; and if you ſay ſo of Repentance, &amp;c. we ſhould not diſagree.</p>
                        <p>You ſay <hi>[In other things I come off, and ſo mollifie my aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:60968:105"/>
that you need not contend] Anſw.</hi> 1. I would you had told me wherein I ſo come off: For I know not of a word. If you mean in that I now ſay, obedience is no condition of our firſt attaining juſtification, but only of the continuance of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſaid the ſame over and over in my book, and leſt it ſhould be over-lookt, I put it in the Index of diſtinctions. If you mean not this, I know not what you mean. 2. But if explication of my ſelf will ſo mollifie and prevent contending, I ſhall be glad to explain my ſelf yet further: Yea, and heartily to recant where I ſee my error. For that which you deſire, <hi>I demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate that its By love, and Through love, &amp;c.</hi> I have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered before by diſtinguiſhing of the ſenſe of <hi>By</hi> and <hi>Through:</hi> and in my ſenſe I have brought you forty plain Texts in my book for proof of it, which ſhew it is no new Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
                        <p>To your argument from <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. Where you ſay that <hi>Abrahams juſtification is the pattern of all others,</hi> I conceive that an uncouth ſpeech, ſtrange to Scripture for phraſe and proper ſenſe, though in a large ſenſe tolerable and true: Certain I am that <hi>Paul</hi> brings <hi>Abrahams</hi> example to prove that we are juſtified by faith without the works of the Law; but as certain that our faith muſt differ from <hi>Abrahams,</hi> even in the eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of it: We muſt believe that <hi>this Jeſus is he, or we ſhall dye in our ſins</hi>; which <hi>Abraham</hi> was not required to believe. Our faith is an explicite Aſſent and Conſent to the Mediators Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, <hi>viz.</hi> that he be our Lord and Saviour, and a Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him, and giving up our ſelves to him accordingly: But whether <hi>Abrahams</hi> (and all recited in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.) were ſuch, is queſtionable. Too much looking on <hi>Abraham</hi> as a pattern, ſeems to be it that occaſioned <hi>Grotius</hi> to give that wretched de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of faith, <hi>(Annot. in loc.)</hi> that <hi>[it is but a high eſtimation of Gods power and wiſdom, and faithfulneſs in keeping his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, &amp;c.]</hi> (yet I know he came ſhort alſo of deſcribing that faith which he lookt on as the pattern.)</p>
                        <p>My firſt anſwer was that <hi>I exclude alſo any effective co-opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>; to which you ſay, [<hi>Why do we ſtrive about words,</hi> &amp;c.] I ſee that mens conceivings are ſo various, that there is no hopes that we ſhould be in all things of one mind. Becauſe I was loth
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:60968:106"/>
to ſtrive about words, therefore I diſtinguiſhed between <hi>cauſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> and <hi>conditionality,</hi> knowing that the word <hi>By</hi> was ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous (when we are ſaid to be juſtified By faith <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) now you take this diſtinguiſhing to be ſtriving about words, to avoid which, you would bring we back to the ambiguous term again. Whereas I cannot but be moſt confident, that as guile is moſt in Generals, ſo there would be nothing elſe between us but ſtriving about words, if we diſpute on an unexplained term, and without diſtinction. Do you indeed think, that to be an efficient cauſe of our juſtification, and to be a bare condition, is all one? or do you think the difference to be of no moment? You ſay, <hi>I do not exclude works juſtifying as well as faith, let the expreſſions be what they will.] Anſw.</hi> 1. You ſhould have ſaid, <hi>[Let the ſenſe, or way of juſtifying be what it will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>]</hi> for ſure the difference between an efficient cauſe and a condition is more then in the expreſſion, or elſe I have been long miſtaken. 2. I do not exclude <hi>God juſtifying, Chriſt juſtifying, the Word juſtifying, &amp;c.</hi> and yet to diſtinguiſh between the way that theſe juſtifie in, and the way in which faith juſtifies, I take to be no ſtriving about words, but of as high concernment as my ſalvation is worth. 3. Either you miſlike my <hi>phraſe,</hi> or my <hi>ſenſe</hi>: if the <hi>phraſe,</hi> then you miſlike the <hi>word of God,</hi> which ſaith, <hi>a man is juſtified by works and not by faith only</hi>; If the <hi>ſenſe,</hi> then you ſhould not fall upon the <hi>phraſe</hi>: and then to diſtinguiſh and explain, is not to ſtrive about words. 4. If I do bring faith and obedience neerer in juſtification then others, it is not by giving <hi>more to works</hi> then others, but by giving <hi>leſs to faith</hi>; And if in that I err, you ſhould have fallen on that and ſhewed it, and not ſpeak ſtill as if I gave more to works then you. I am ſure I give <hi>leſs to man,</hi> and therefore <hi>no leſs than you to Chriſt.</hi> I perceive not the leaſt diſadvantage herein that I lye open to, but only the <hi>odium</hi> of the phraſe of <hi>juſtification by works,</hi> with men that are carried by prejudice and cuſtome. 5. I will not quarrel about ſuch a word; but I like not your phraſe of <hi>[Faith juſtifying, and works juſtifying,]</hi> for it is fitter to introduce the conceit of an efficiency in them, then to ſay, <hi>[We are juſtified by faith and by works]</hi> which are only the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture phraſe, and ſignifie but a conditionality.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="189" facs="tcp:60968:106"/>To that you ſay out of <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. I believe <hi>Paul</hi> doth moſt appoſitely oppoſe the righteouſneſs which is by faith to that which is by the Law. But then 1. He means not [By faith as an inſtrument of juſtification] 2. Nor by faith which is but a meer affiance on Chriſt for juſtification, or only as ſuch. 3. Nor doth he exclude Knowledge, Repentance, Obedience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 4. But to ſay that righteouſneſs or juſtification is <hi>by love,</hi> or <hi>by obedience, &amp;c.</hi> Without adding any more, is not a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient ſpeech, as it is to ſay that righteouſneſs is by faith. 1. Becauſe the ſpeech ſeems to be of the firſt receiving of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, wherein obedience or works have no hand. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe faith having moſt clear direct relation to Chriſt, doth moſt plainly point out our righteouſneſs to be in him. 3. Becauſe faith as it is taken in the Goſpel, is a moſt comprehenſive grace, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining many acts, and implying or including many others which relate to Chriſt as the object alſo. Even obedience to Chriſt is implyed as a neceſſary ſubſequent part of the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſeeing faith is an accepting of Chriſt as Lord and King, and Head, and Husband, as well as a juſtifier. 5. Yet Scripture ſaith as well as I, that Chriſt ſhall juſtifie us <hi>By his knowledge,</hi> and we ſhall be <hi>juſtified by our words, and by works</hi>; and me thinks it ſhould be no ſin to ſpeak the words of God, except it be ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that I miſunderſtand them. It is not ſo fit a phraſe, to ſay, that a poor ignoble woman, was made rich and honorable by her Love, or Obedience, or Marriage, faithfulneſs, and conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal actions, as to ſay, it was by marriage with ſuch a Noble man, or conſent to take him to be her husband: For the marriage conſent and Covenant doth imply conjugal affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, action and faithfulneſs. Yet are theſe laſt as flat conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of her continuing her enjoyments as the marriage Covenant was of firſt obtaining them.</p>
                        <p>To my ſecond Anſwer, you ſhew that <hi>Paul</hi> excludes works under any notion. 1. From his oppoſition between faith and works, where you ſay I contradict <hi>Paul,</hi> and give a <hi>tertium.</hi> To which I anſwer, to diſtinguiſh of <hi>Pauls</hi> terms, and explain his meaning in his own words is not to give a <hi>tertium,</hi> or contradict; but this is all that I do. I diſtinguiſh of the word <hi>Works</hi>; ſometime it is taken more largely for <hi>Acts or Actions,</hi>
                           <pb n="190" facs="tcp:60968:107"/>
and ſo <hi>James</hi> takes it: ſometimes more ſtrictly for only ſuch <hi>Actions as a Labourer performeth for his Wages,</hi> or which <hi>make the Reward to be not of Grace, but of debt.</hi> So <hi>Paul</hi> tells you that he underſtandeth or uſeth the term, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.4. uſually there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore calling them <hi>Works of the Law.</hi> Now he that excludes Works only under <hi>this</hi> notion, doth not therefore exclude them under every notion. Where you add that Pauls <hi>oppoſition is between Faith and any thing of ours</hi>: I anſwer. 1. Is not Faith <hi>ours</hi> as much Love, <hi>&amp;c</hi>? 2. Are not <hi>Knowledge, Words, Works, ours,</hi> by all which God ſaith, we are juſtified? 3. There is no ſuch Scripture where <hi>Paul</hi> makes any ſuch oppoſition: but only he renounceth his own Righteouſneſs which is of the Law, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8, 9. and any thing of our own that may be called <hi>Works</hi> in the ſtricter ſence.</p>
                        <p>Your ſecond is, <hi>becauſe</hi> Paul <hi>excludes</hi> Abrahams <hi>works, &amp;c.</hi> Anſwer. 1. You make my <hi>tertium</hi> to be <hi>[works that are of Grace]</hi> and here again, <hi>works that flow from Grace,</hi> and ſay, Abrahams <hi>were not by meer ſtrength of the Law:</hi> But theſe are no words of mine; nor is it candid to feign them to be mine; but that I impute it to your haſte: I believe you remembred ſo well the words of <hi>Andradius, Bellarmine,</hi> and other Papiſts, that they dropped from your pen in haſte in ſtead of mine; nor is my ſence any whit like theirs; for I ſpeak not of the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſe of works, (Nature or Grace) nor the meer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand requiring them, when I ſpeak of Law and Goſpel: but the full entire Covenant or Law conſiſting of all its parts, and ſo making our Acts the conditions of the Puniſhment or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: as I have opened over and over in my Book. 2. You ask, <hi>Were</hi> Abrahams <hi>works in oppoſition to that, &amp;c</hi>? Anſwer. 1. <hi>Paul</hi> excludes alſo works in co-ordination with Chriſt, and ſo do I. 2. Yea and works ſuppoſed to be ſubordinate to Chriſt, which are not capable of a real ſubordination, 3. but not ſuch as are truly ſubordinate, from being ſuch conditions as is before ſaid. 4. You ſeem to me to miſtake <hi>Paul</hi> much, as if he took it for granted, that <hi>Abraham</hi> had ſuch works which <hi>Paul</hi> diſputeth againſt, but could not be juſtified by them; Whereas I doubt not to ſay, that <hi>Paul</hi> contrarily ſuppoſeth that <hi>Abraham</hi> had no ſuch Works, (which make the reward to be of Debt, and
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:60968:107"/>
not of Grace) and therefore could not be juſtified by them.</p>
                        <p>Your third Argument is, <hi>[becauſe imputing, covering, all is wholly attributed to God.] Anſwer,</hi> I doubt not but that God is the only Principal efficient Cauſe, and his Promiſe or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant the Inſtrumental: therefore I cannot think as others, that man is the efficient Inſtrumental by believing, or that Faith is ſuch: But what Is all therefore attributed to God? Even the performance of the Conditions on mans part? Or are there no ſuch conditions which man muſt perform himſelf or periſh? God only covereth ſin, imputeth Righteouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but to none who have not performed the Conditions. Is Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving attributed to God, or is it an act of man? Or is it exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded? When will you prove the Conſequence of this Argument?</p>
                        <p>Your fifth Argument is, <hi>[becauſe the Aſſertion is univerſal without works in general] Anſwer,</hi> 1. Doth not the Apoſtle contradict you by expounding himſelf in the very next verſe before thoſe you cite? <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.4. That by works he means not ſimply <hi>good Actions,</hi> as <hi>James</hi> doth, but ſuch as make the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to be of debt and not of Grace? Indeed ſuch works are univerſally excluded. 2. Therefore he excludes the very <hi>preſence</hi> of works, and ſaith, <hi>to him that worketh not,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ver.</hi> 5. But the <hi>preſence</hi> of good actions you ſay is not excluded.</p>
                        <p>Your laſt Argument ſeems to me the ſame with the fourth, and it forceth me to admire that you ſhould think the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence good. <hi>Bleſſedneſs is when ſin is forgiven; therefore no work or good act performed by man is the condition of forgiveneſs, either as begun or continued, or conſummate]</hi> If this be not your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, you ſay nothing againſt me: if it be, I aſſure you it is not in my Power to believe it, nor to diſcern the leaſt ſhaddow of probability of truth in it, nor to free it from the charge of being the groſſeſt Antinomianiſm <hi>(ſi pace tui ità dicam.)</hi> And here I muſt needs tell you alſo my utter diſability to reconcile you with your ſelf; for you before ſay, they are <hi>media ordinata,</hi> and here you ſay, <hi>They are excluded under any notion</hi>: As if to be a <hi>medium</hi> were <hi>no notion</hi>; or the <hi>medium</hi> did nothing in or to the very juſtifying of the perſon.</p>
                        <p>To my next Anſwer. <hi>If works be excluded under any notion, then</hi> James <hi>his words cannot be true, that we are juſtified by works.</hi>
                           <pb n="192" facs="tcp:60968:108"/>
You reply, <hi>If there be juſtifying works, how ſaith</hi> Paul <hi>true?</hi> I anſwer. This is a moſt evident <hi>Petitio principii.</hi> It is unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable that <hi>James</hi> includeth works under ſome notion: and that <hi>Paul</hi> excludeth them under ſome other notion: now therefore I might well ask, <hi>How ſaith</hi> James <hi>true elſe</hi>? Becauſe my ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition cannot be denyed: But you ſuppoſe that <hi>Paul</hi> exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth works under any notion, (which is the very Queſtion, and is denyed.) When you ask <hi>how ſaith</hi> Paul <hi>true? Paul</hi> ſaith true becauſe he ſpeaks of works ſtrictly taken, as is by himſelf explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: <hi>James</hi> could not ſay true, if works under every notion (as you ſay) be excluded.</p>
                        <p>Next you come to reconcile them by expounding <hi>James</hi>; where you ſay, <hi>Faith which in reſpect of its Act</hi> ad intra, <hi>only juſtifies, yet it works</hi> ad extra: <hi>fides quae viva, non qua viva.</hi> I anſwer. Whats this to the Queſtion? The Queſtion is not whether Faith work? Nor whether Faith juſtifie? Nor what Faith juſtifieth? But in what ſence <hi>James</hi> ſaith, we are juſtified by works, and not by Faith only? You anſwer by a direct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to <hi>James,</hi> (if I can reach the ſence of your Anſwer) ſaying, <hi>It is by Faith only, and that not as it liveth, &amp;c.</hi> So dare not I directly ſay, <hi>it is not by works,</hi> when God ſaith <hi>it is</hi>: but think I am bound to diſtinguiſh, and ſhew in what ſence works juſtifie, and in what not; and not to ſay flatly againſt God, <hi>that we are not juſtified by works under any notion,</hi> but only by the Faith which worketh. A denyal of Gods Aſſertions is an ill expounding of them.</p>
                        <p>To what you ſay of the judgement of the Orthodox, <hi>[that they go eadem via et ſi non eadem ſemita]</hi> I anſwer, you may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand your diſtinction as you pleaſe, but I have ſhewed the difference: ſome underſtand it of juſtification before God; others before men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if you pleaſe to make the way wide enough, you may take me among the Orthodox, that go <hi>eadem via</hi>: if not, I will ſtand out with <hi>James.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>When you ſay <hi>[they exclude works under any notion in the act of juſtification.]</hi> I anſwer, 1. Your ſelf include them as antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and concomitants (thought I do not,) 2. I have ſhewed before that <hi>[in the act, &amp;c.]</hi> is ambiguous. If you mean <hi>[as Agents of Cauſes],</hi> ſo do I exclude them. If you mean <hi>[as
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:60968:108"/>

                        <p>My next anſwer was <hi>[If works under any notion be excluded, then faith is excluded]</hi> You reply 1. <hi>[Thus Bellarmine, &amp;c.] Anſw.</hi> I knew indeed that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith ſo. But Sir, you ſpeak to one that is very neer Gods tribunal, and therefore is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to look after naked truth, and not to be affrighted from it by the name either of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> or <hi>Antichriſt</hi>; and who is at laſt brought to wink at prejudice. I am fully reſolved by Gods grace to go on in the way of God as he diſcovereth it to me, and not to turn out of it when <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſtands in it. Though the Divels believe, I will (by Gods help) believe too: and not deny Chriſt, becauſe the Divels confeſs him. You ſay, <hi>Non ſequitur,</hi> I prove the conſequence. If all works (or acts) be excluded under any notion whatſoever, and if faith be a work or act then faith is excluded. But, &amp;c. <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c. By the reaſon of your denyal I underſtand and nothing that you <hi>deny,</hi> but <hi>[that faith is a work or act]</hi> which I never heard denyed before, and I hope never ſhall do again. The common anſwer to <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> is, that <hi>faith which is a work juſtifieth, but not as it is a work:</hi> Which anſwer I confeſs to be ſound, and ſubſcribe to it. But then according to that, faith which is a work juſtifieth under ſome notion (ſuppoſe it were under the notion of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument) though not under the notion of a work. But you go another way, and ſay, 1. <hi>Faith is paſſive in its inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, and though to believe, be a grammatical action, its</hi> ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum activum, <hi>yet its phyſicè, or huper phyſice paſſive. A man by believing doth not</hi> operari, <hi>but</hi> recipere. <hi>As</hi> videre, audire, <hi>are Grammatical actions, but phyſical or natural paſſions, &amp;c.</hi> Anſwer. 1. Theſe are very ſublime Aſſertions, quite paſt the reach of my capacity, and of all theirs that I uſe to converſe with; and I dare ſay it is no Hereſie to deny them, nor can that point be neer the foundation that ſtands upon ſuch props which few men can apprehend. 2. What if Faith were <hi>paſſive in its Inſtrumentality</hi>? Is it not at all an <hi>Act</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? If it be; Then that which is an <hi>Act</hi> or <hi>Work,</hi> is not excluded under the notion <hi>of a paſſive Inſtrument</hi>; and ſo
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:60968:109"/>
not under <hi>every notion</hi> (I ſpeak on your grounds. But) becauſe you told me before that I ſhould have ſpent my ſelf againſt this Inſtrumentality of Faith if I would hit the mark; I will ſpeak the more largely to it now: And 1. Enquire whether <hi>videre, audire,</hi> be only Grammatical Actions (as you call them) and natural paſſions? 2. Whether Believing be ſo, only <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum activum,</hi> but Phyſically paſſive? And ſo to Believe, is not <hi>agere,</hi> but <hi>pati</hi> or <hi>recipere</hi>? 3. Whether faith be paſſive in its Inſtrumentality? 4. Whether the ſame may not be ſaid as truly of other Graces? 5. Whether Faith be any proper Inſtrument of our Juſtification? 6. If it were, Whether that be the primary, formal Reaſon of its juſtifying ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue? 7. Whether your Opinion or mine be the plainer or ſafer?</p>
                        <p>And for the firſt, I ſhould not think it worth the looking after, but that I perceive you lay much upon it, and that Philoſophers generally ſuppoſe that the Sence and Intellect in this are alike; and for ought I diſcern, it is ſuch a Paſsiveneſs of the Intellect that you intend: and therefore we may put all together, and enquire whether <hi>videre &amp; intelligere</hi> be only Paſsions? And here you know how ill Philoſophers are agreed among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and therefore how ſlippery a ground this is for a man to build his Faith upon in ſo high point as this in hand: you know alſo that <hi>Hippocrates, Galen, Plato, Plotinus,</hi> with the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the <hi>Platoniſts</hi> are directly contrary to you: you know alſo that <hi>Albertus Magnus,</hi> and his followers judge ſenſation to be an action, though they take the <hi>potentia</hi> to be paſſive. You know alſo that <hi>Aquinas</hi> with his followers judge the very <hi>potentia</hi> to be active as well as paſſive; <hi>paſſive</hi> while it <hi>receiveth the ſpecies</hi>; and <hi>active, Dum per ipſam agit &amp; ſenſationem producit.</hi> And <hi>Tolet</hi> ſaith, that this is Scotus <hi>his ſentence,</hi> 2. <hi>de Anima. q.</hi> 12. <hi>&amp; Capreol. &amp; ferè communis.</hi> I know <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſaith, that <hi>intelligere eſt quoddam pati</hi>; but he taketh <hi>pati</hi> in his third wide improper ſenſe, as <hi>omne qu d exit de potentia in actum, poteſt dici pati</hi>: 1. q. 79 a. 2. C. And no doubt every ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cauſe may be ſaid to ſuffer even in its acting, as it receiveth the Influx from the firſt, which cauſeth it to act; but it will not thence follow that the <gap reason="foreign">

I cannot think that you deny the <hi>intellectum agentem</hi>: and you know that generally Philoſophers attribute Action to the <hi>poſſible Intellect:</hi> and that <hi>Jandun. Apollina, &amp;c.</hi> do accordingly make an <hi>Agent and patient ſence</hi>: and if the reception of the <hi>ſpecies</hi> were <hi>formaliter viſio &amp; intellectio</hi> (which I believe not) yet how hardly is it proved that the Organ and Intellect are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſsive in that reception? Yea how great a controverſie is it what the ſenſible and intelligible <hi>ſpecies</hi> are? Yea and whether there be any ſuch thing? Whether they be an image or ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude begotten or cauſed by the Object, as <hi>Combacchius</hi> and moſt? which yet <hi>Suarez, &amp;c.</hi> denyeth. And whether they ſtick in the air, and have all their Being firſt there, as <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyrus,</hi> and other <hi>Peripateticks</hi>? Or whether their Being is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the eye? as ſome later. Or whether it be Sir <hi>Ken. Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byes</hi> Atomes or number of ſmall bodies which are in perpetual motion? I doubt not you know that <hi>Ockam</hi> and <hi>Henricus quod. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>q.</hi> 4. reject all <hi>ſpecies</hi> as vain, and make the Intellect the only active proper cauſe of intellection. And <hi>Hobs</hi> of late in his book of humane Nature ſaith, <hi>that viſible and intelligible</hi> ſpecies, <hi>is the greateſt Paradox in the world, as being a plain Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility.</hi> And indeed it is ſomewhat ſtrange that every ſtone and clod ſhould be in perpetual Action, ſending forth that which we call its <hi>ſpecies</hi>; for doubtleſs it ſendeth forth as much when we behold it not as when we do. And more ſtrange that a Rock or Mountain ſhould be ſo active a creature, and ſo forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in action, as to ſend forth its <hi>ſpecies</hi> ſo many miles! Yea, according to this Doctrine, many 1000 miles: for if our Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan were capable, we ſhould ſee it ſo far. Whether the Angels ſee theſe things on earth <hi>recipiendo ſpecies,</hi> or not; ſure according to this Doctrine, the <hi>ſpecies</hi> muſt reach as far as Heaven. And why do not ſtones waſt by ſuch an unceſſant emanation? And it is ſtrange to conceive how the Air is be painted with variety of <hi>ſpecies,</hi> if this be true! that every Graſs, Flower, Tree, Bird, Stone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and other bodies, have their ſeveral diſtinct <hi>ſpecies</hi> in the Air night and day? How ſtrangely is it painted? What room is there for them all, without confuſion, If both color, quantity, odor, and all be there? And its ſtrange if we do not hear the ſound nor taſte the ſweetneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but only the <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi>

of them! and beyond my Capacity how we ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern <hi>Diſtance</hi> as well as the <hi>Object diſtant</hi> according to the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive opinion! and more hard is it for me to believe this Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, when I conſider how <hi>Cats</hi> and <hi>Owls</hi> ſee in the night: and how a man in a deep ſtudy, or that ſteepeth with his eyes open, ſeeth not any thing diſtinctly (though I know the frivolous an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to theſe:) And yet more hardly do I believe it when I feel <hi>quanto labore &amp; conatu</hi> I muſt ſee to read a ſmall print, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern a thing afar off: but above all when I feel the labor of my ſtudies, I hardly believe that my underſtanding is not active; though I eaſily believe that I am alſo too paſſive. Why do I not underſtand with every dull thought? To believe alſo that every ſtone is ſtill active, and that the eye and Intellect of the living Creature is but paſſive, is hard to me; becauſe me thinks Action better agreeth to the living, then the inanimate. And yet the leſs do I aſſent when I obſerve what ſtreſs they lay upon the ſimilitude of a looking-glaſs receiving the <hi>ſpecies,</hi> which I am very confident it did never receive, when I ſee it moving as my eye moveth, and withdrawing when I withdraw, (though the Object be any ſtone or other immovable thing) I judge that when I am gone, the glaſs receiveth no more <hi>ſpecies</hi> from the wall, then the wall from the glaſs; nor that the water re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives any more <hi>ſpecies</hi> of the Moon that there appears, then the earth doth; but that all is in mine eyes by the help of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection.

For that which belongeth to the underſtanding, it muſt be either a <hi>ſimple appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, a compoſition or diviſion, or a ratiocination or Judgement.</hi> And 1. A ſimple Apprehenſion it cannot be: 1. For ſo the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect receiveth all Objects alike. It receiveth ſin, death, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, Satan, hell in the ſame kind as it receiveth Grace, Life, Righteouſneſs, Chriſt, Heaven. For it <hi>underſtandeth</hi> both in the ſame way, receiving them <hi>per modum objecti.</hi> 2. And thus it receiveth not the <hi>very thing</hi> it ſelf Eſſentially, (though it <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand</hi> the thing it ſelf) but only as is ſaid, the <hi>ſpecies</hi> or action of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (except you will ſay as Sir <hi>Ken.

And how oft
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:60968:112"/>
hath <hi>Bellarmine</hi> been called Sophiſter for ſuppoſing, we mean ſuch an apprehenſion? Therefore I will not dare to think that you mean this. 4.

But if you mean not this <hi>ſimple apprehenſion</hi> (as ſure you do not) then how is it poſsible to imagine the underſtanding ſhould be <hi>paſſive</hi> in it? Did ever man that writ of Philoſophy once think that the ſoul did <hi>componere, dicidere, ratiocinari, judicare, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endo &amp; non agendo</hi>? I think no man.

                        <p>Moſt Divines place the chief Eſſence of Faith in <hi>fiducia:</hi> but then they are as ill agreed what to mean by <hi>fiducia.

Faith, but that commonly called Aſſurance. Now this kind of <hi>fiducia</hi> is but the Aſſent we have ſpoken of, and is beyond all diſpute no meer <hi>Paſſion,</hi> but an <hi>Act</hi> of the Underſtanding.</p>
                        <p n="2">2.

                        <p>Or elſe it is an <hi>Imparate</hi> Act; and then we are in a wood to ſeek among ſo many that there is little hope of finding it. The Truth ſeems to me to be beyond diſpute, that <hi>fiducia</hi> is no one ſingle Act (though one word) but a compoſition of many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying or containing the <hi>Aſſent</hi> of the underſtanding, the <hi>Election</hi> of the Will, eſpecially much of <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſneſs</hi> in the Iraſcible of the Senſitive, together with a ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſome acts. And if we are juſtified by this <hi>Recumbency</hi> or <hi>Fiducia,</hi> I ſhall believe we are juſtified as well by <hi>Hope</hi> as any thing; for that takes up moſt here, as <hi>Dr.</hi> Downam <hi>ubi ſupra</hi> proveth. And who ever ſaid that in all or any of theſe the Soul <hi>is Paſſive and not Active</hi>? Indeed <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Venturouſneſs</hi> are <hi>Paſſions,</hi> but in another ſenſe (as <hi>Keckerm.</hi> and <hi>Tolet ubi ſupra</hi> have well opened; its in reſpect of their <hi>quaſi materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ale.</hi>) I am content to ſtand or fall by the vote of Philoſophers, giving you 100 to one, whether the <hi>Formality of theſe motions
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:60968:113"/>
of the Will lie in Paſsion or Action</hi>? And if they are <hi>Acts. whether they can be the Subjects of Paſsion; and ſo be paſsive Acts?</hi> So that yet I cannot find out your paſsive Faith.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. But yet further, if Faith be paſsive Phyſically, let us find out firſt what is the <hi>Agent?</hi> 2. What the <hi>Action</hi>? 3. What the <hi>Patient</hi> or <hi>Object?</hi> 4. What is the <hi>Terminus ad quem</hi>?</p>
                        <p n="1">1. I doubt not but it is agreed that the Agent is God: for it is he that juſtifieth. 2. The <hi>terminus</hi> or <hi>res motu facta</hi> is two-fold. 1. Juſtification <hi>in ſenſu legis,</hi> commonly called <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutive Juſtification</hi> (paſsive.) 2. <hi>Publique Juſtification by plea and ſentence at Judgement</hi> (paſsive) 3. The Action muſt be therefore two-fold, or two Actions according to the two-fold <hi>Terminus.</hi> Yea in the former we may (if we accurately conſider it) find out a two-fold <hi>Action</hi> and <hi>Terminus,</hi> though the difference be narrow: In which we are to conſider, 1. Of the Inſtrument: 2. Add the nature of the Actions. 1. The Inſtrument is the word of Promiſe or Grant in the Goſpel (for if you know any other way of Gods juſtifying, or any immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Act of God herein which is Tranſient, I would it were reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what Act it is.) Herein I have Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> ſaying as I, over and over againſt the <hi>Antinomians.</hi> 2. The Action there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can be no other then a moral Action, as a Leaſe or Bond, or written-Law may be ſaid to act. Now the Goſpel perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to our firſt Juſtification a two-fold Action. 1. It doth as a Deed of Gift beſtow Chriſt and his Merits on men, ſo it be they will Believe. This Action doth not immediately and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly conſtitute them Righteous: for Righteouſneſs being a Relation, muſt have its Foundation firſt laid: This Act there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of Donation (which ſome call Imputation) doth directly lay the <hi>Fundamentum,</hi> whence the Relation of Righteous doth immediately ariſe (when the Condition is peformed) <hi>per nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam reſultantiam</hi> without any other Act to produce it. And this is moſt properly called <hi>Juſtificatio conſtitutiva activa.</hi> 2. When the Goſpel hath by Gift conſtituted us Righteous then next in order it doth declare or pronounce us Righteous, and vertually acquit us from Condemnation. This is by the like ſilent moral interpretative Action only as the other. (And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:60968:114"/>
may be moſt fitly called the imputing of Righteouſneſs, or eſteeming us Righteous, as <hi>Piſcator.</hi>) And for the latter Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication at Judgement, the Action is Chriſts publique pleading, and ſentencing us Acquitt: which is an Action both Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical and Moral in ſeveral reſpects. 4. Now if we enquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Patient, or rather the Object of theſe ſeveral Acts, we ſhall quckly find that the Man is that Object; but that Faith is any Patient here, is paſt my apprehenſion. For the firſt Act of God by the Goſpel [giving Chriſt and his Merit to us,] it is only a moral Action: (Though the writting and ſpeaking the Word at firſt was a Phyſical action, yet the Word or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe now doth <hi>moraliter tantùm agere</hi>:) And therefore it is impoſsible that Faith ſhould be Phyſically paſsive from it. For Paſsion being an effect of Action, it muſt be a Phyſical proper Action which produceth a phyſical Paſsion. I will not ſtand to make your Aſſertion odious here by enquiring what Phyſical ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective Influx, Contact, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> here is, which ſhould manifeſt Faith to be phyſically Paſsive. I know in the Work of effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual vocation the Soul is firſt paſsive: but that is nothing to our Queſtion, whether Faith be paſsive in Juſtification. Do but tell me plainly <hi>quid patitur fides,</hi> and you do the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                        <p>But what if you had only ſaid that Faith is <hi>morally paſſive,</hi> and not <hi>phyſically</hi>? I anſwer. It had been leſs harſh to me, though not fit, nor to the point. For 1. Gods Juſtification nor Donation of Chriſt, is not properly of, or to Faith; for then Faith ſhould be made righteous and juſtified hereby; but to the perſon, if he Believe. 2. Beſides if you ſhould confeſs only a moral Paſsiveneſs (which is ſomewhat an odd phraſe and notion, and is but to be the Object of a moral Action) it would ſpoil all the common arguments drawn from the phyſical nature of Faith, and its ſole excellency herein in apprehending, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and thereby juſtifying. And you would bring in all other Graces to which the ſame Promiſe may as well be ſaid to be made. 3. The Truth I have and further ſhall mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt to be this; that as it is not to faith or any other act that Righteouſneſs is given, but to the perſon on condition he Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; ſo this condition is no paſsion but an action, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:60968:114"/>
actions. This will fully appear in the Theological Reaſons following. In the mean time I need not ſtand on this, becauſe you expreſs your ſelf that Faith is <hi>phyſically paſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>iſtinction of <hi>phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce &amp; moraliter,</hi> yet I ſuppoſe that is none of your meaning who know that even <hi>Intellectus dum efficit intellectionem, &amp; voluntas volitionem, ſunt cauſae phyſicae, ut</hi> Suarez. 1. <hi>Tom. diſp.</hi> 17. §. 2. p. 260. and ſo <hi>Schibler,</hi> and many more: yea and that our Divines conclude that Gods action on our ſouls in converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is firſt Phyſical: which yet may be as truly and fully called hyperphyſical as our Faith.</p>
                        <p>Now for the ſecond action of the Goſpel, [<hi>decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring or pronouncing the Believer righteous, and ſo</hi> de ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re <hi>acquitting him</hi>;] It is much more beyond my reach to conceive how faith can in reſpect of it be paſsive: For 1. Beſides that it is a moral action as the former, and ſo cannot of it ſelf produce a phyſical paſsion. 2. It doth not therein ſpeak of or to faith, pronouncing it juſt, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitting it, but of and to the Believer. So that if Faith were phyſically paſsive in the former, yet here it is impoſsible. 3. If you ſay that it is phyſically (or morally) paſsive in regard of the latter full Juſtification by ſentence at Judgement, you would tranſcend my capacity moſt of all. To ſay faith is the Patient of Chriſts judiciary publique ſentence, is a ſentence that ſhall never be an article of my Faith: and is ſo groſs, that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture you would take it ill if I ſhould take it to be your mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: therefore I will ſay no more againſt it. Now you know that this is (as you ſay in your <hi>Lect.</hi>) the moſt <hi>compleat Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi>; and which I moſt ſtand upon: and therefore if your arguments fail in reſpect of this, they yield me almoſt all I expect.</p>
                        <p>Next I will tell you my Reaſons Theological why I believe not that juſtifying faith, as ſuch, is paſsive. 1. All Divines and the Scripture it ſelf hath perſwaded me, that Chriſt and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are the Object of this Faith: but a Paſsion hath no Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but a ſubject, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore according to you Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           <pb n="206" facs="tcp:60968:115"/>
is not the object of it; which is contrary to all that I have heard or read.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. I have read Divines long contending <hi>which is</hi> the Act of juſtifying faith, <hi>qua talis.</hi> And ſome ſay one, and ſome another; but all ſay one, or other, or many. Now you cut the knot, and contradict all, in making it (at leaſt <hi>quatenus Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtificans</hi>) <hi>no Act at all,</hi> but a <hi>Paſsion</hi>: unleſs you will ſay it is a <hi>paſsive act,</hi> which I dare not imagine. And doubtleſs theſe Divines ſhew by their whole ſpeech that by <hi>Actus Fidei,</hi> they mean <hi>Actus ſecundus vel Actio,</hi> and not <hi>Actus primus vel ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tativus vel accidentalis, ſive ut informans, ſive ut operativus, ſed ipſa operatio.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. I am truly afraid leſt by entertaining this opinion I ſhould ſtrike in not only with the <hi>Antinomians</hi> (who cannot endure to hear of any conditions of life of our performing, but even with the <hi>Libertines,</hi> who tell me to my face, that man is but Paſsive, and as the ſoul Acts the body, ſo Chriſt in them moveth the ſoul to Good, and Satan to evil, while they are meerly Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, and therefore the Devil ſhall be damned for ſin who committeth it in them, and not they; for who will bite the ſtone or beat the ſtaff, or be angry at the ſword? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. Elſe you muſt depreſs the excellent grace of faith below all other, in making it meerly Paſsive while others are active: For doubtleſs life and excellency is more in Action then Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. If believing be only ſuffering, then all Infidels are damned only for not ſuffering, which is horrid.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Scripture frequently condemneth wicked men for Action, for Rebellion, Refuſing, Rejecting Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.27. They hate him and ſay, we will not have this man reign over us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and this is their unbelief. If they reſiſted the Holy Ghoſt only <hi>Paſſivè &amp; non Activè,</hi> then it would be only an <hi>ineptitudo materiei,</hi> which is in all alike at firſt, and ſo all ſhould be alike rejecters.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. If to believe be but <hi>Pati,</hi> then it is God and not man that ſhould be perſwaded: For perſwaſion is either to Action or forbearing Action; and God is the Agent: But it is in vain to perſwade any to be Paſsive, except it be not to ſtrive
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:60968:115"/>
againſt it. This therefore would overthrow much of the uſe of the Miniſtry.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. And then when Chriſt ſo extolleth <hi>doing the will of God,</hi> and <hi>doing his Commandments, &amp;c.</hi> you will exclude juſtifying faith, as being no <hi>doing.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="9">9. Is it credible, that when Chriſt cals faith <hi>Obeying the Goſpel,</hi> and ſaith, <hi>This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom the father hath ſent</hi>; and calls it the <hi>work of faith,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.11. and ſaith, <hi>God giveth to will,</hi> (that is, to believe) <hi>and to do, &amp;c.</hi> that all this is meant of meer Paſsion? I undertake to bring forty places of Scripture that ſhew faith to be Action.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. It ſeemeth to me ſo great a debaſing of faith, as to make it to be no vertue at all, nor to have any moral good in it. For though I have read of <hi>Paſſio perfectiva in genere entis vel naturae,</hi> and conducible to vertue; Yet am I not convinced yet that any Paſsion as ſuch, hath any moral vertue in it. Indeed Paſsion may be the <hi>quaſi materiale,</hi> but the vertue is in Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Yea, even in non-acting, (as ſilence) the vertue lies formally in the actual exerciſe of the Authority of Reaſon, and ſo obeying God in cauſing that ſilence. Sure if men ſhall be all judged according to their works, and according to what they have done, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then it will not be becauſe they did ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Pati vel non pati.</hi> And thus you have ſome of my reaſons why I cannot believe that <hi>Believing is paſsion,</hi> nor ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it I think, till <hi>Credere</hi> be <hi>Pati,</hi> and then I may whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I will or no, becauſe <hi>pati vel non pati</hi> are not in my choice.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The third Queſtion is, <hi>Whether faith be paſsive in its inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentality?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And I think that is out of doubt, if my former arguing have proved that faith is not paſſive at all: or if I next prove that faith is no <hi>phyſical inſtrument.</hi> But yet if I ſhould grant both that faith is <hi>paſsive,</hi> and that it is an <hi>Inſtrument,</hi> yet muſt I have either more or leſs Logick before I can believe that it is <hi>paſsive in its inſtrumentality.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>My reaſons againſt it are theſe. 1. Every Inſtrumental cauſe is an efficient cauſe: but all true efficiency is by action:
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:60968:116"/>
therefore all inſtrumentality is by action. That <hi>cauſalitas efficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis eſt Actio; &amp; haec eſt forma per quam denominatur efficiens; quia agens &amp; efficiens ſunt idem,</hi> &amp;c. I have been taught ſo oft and ſo confidently that I believe it. (For <hi>oportet diſcentem credere</hi>): and that by Philoſophers of no mean eſteem, as <hi>Suarez Tom.</hi> 1. <hi>diſp.</hi> 18. §. 10. <hi>Javel. Metaph l.</hi> 9. <hi>q.</hi> 16. <hi>Conim.

Alſted. &amp; Burgerſdicius</hi> do talk of a Paſſive inſtrument; but I think in proper ſpeech it is a contradiction, in <hi>adjecto</hi> and ſay as <hi>Schibler Metaphyſ. l.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 22. <hi>Tit.</hi> 7. <hi>p.</hi> 319. <hi>Niſi Actionem propriam haberet Inſtrumentum, ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiens non eſſet; &amp; proinde paſsivum inſtrumentum quod Keckerm. vocat, revera inſtrumentum non eſt.

For ſure, <hi>Nihil eſt falſum in Theologia, quod verum eſt in Philoſophia.</hi> I deny not but the ſoul in believing is both Paſsive and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, but in ſeveral reſpects: as if <hi>Camero's</hi> way ſhould hold of infuſing grace into the will <hi>Mediante actione intellectus,</hi> then the intellect would be Paſsive or receiving grace into it ſelf, and an <hi>inſtrument</hi> of conveying it to the will: but then it would be no Paſſive but an Active inſtrument: and the action of God on the Paſsive intellect and of the intellect on the will, are two Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with diſtinct effects.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Though there were ſuch a thing in the world as a Paſsive inſtrument, yet that <hi>faith</hi> ſhould be ſuch, and that <hi>phyſical,</hi> I dare ſay is either an unfit aſſertion, or elſe I am of a ſtupid ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion.
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:60968:116"/>
For there muſt be found in it (if it were ſuch) theſe four requiſites. 1. There muſt be a phyſical paſsion or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. 2. A phyſical efficiency. 3. This efficiency muſt be <hi>patiendo, non agendo.</hi> 4. And it muſt be ſuch an efficiency as is proper to inſtruments. I may not ſtand to enquire exactly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all theſe. 1. The firſt I have confuted already, and ſhall add this much more. 1. What doth faith thus receive? 2. How doth it receive it? 3. Whence? Or from what Agent and Act? 1. Is it Chriſt himſelf that is phyſically received by faith? 1. Who dare ſay ſo, but the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>biquitarians,</hi> and Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation men? and perhaps not they. Chriſt is in Heaven, and we on earth. A multitude of blaſphemers, Libertines, and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, I lately meet with that dream of this but no ſober man. 2. And indeed if Chriſts perſon were thus received, it would not make a man righteous, or juſtifie him. As all our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines ſay, his being in the body of <hi>Mary</hi> would not have juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied her: Nor did the kiſſing of his lips juſtifie <hi>Judas</hi>; nor eating and drinking in his preſence juſtifie thoſe that muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from him for working iniquity, <hi>Matthew</hi> 7. If we had ſo known Chriſt, we ſhould know him no more: It was neceſſary to his Diſciples that he ſhould go from them; we muſt not have the <hi>Capernaites</hi> conceit of eating his fleſh. Yea, to talk of a <hi>phyſical</hi> receiving by faith, is far groſſer: For the mouth was capable of that phyſical contact, which faith is not. 3. And then this will not ſtand with their Judgement, that blame me for making Chriſt himſelf the object of juſtifying faith, and not the promiſe directly. 2. If you ſay that the thing received is Chriſts righteouſneſs, (as moſt do that I read) I anſwer, 1. Righteouſneſs is but a relation: And therefore a thing which is naturally uncapable of being of it ſelf phyſically apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This is paſt doubt. 2. If it be phyſically received, then either as a principle and quality, or as an object. Not the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: For ſo we receive our firſt, (and after) grace in ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; but none ever ſaid ſo in juſtification: Nor indeed can that righteouſneſs which is formally but a relation, dwel in us as a principle or quality<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If we receive it as an object, then by an Act: Or if the ſoul were granted to be paſsive in reception of an object, I have ſhewed that, 1. It is but <hi>in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſione
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:60968:117"/>
ſimplici:</hi> None pleadeth for more: But faith is not ſuch. 2. And ſo it would receive Chriſt no otherways then it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth any object whatſoever it thus apprehendeth. 3. And this is not to receive Chriſt or his righteouſneſs, but the meer ſpecies of it according to your own Philoſophers, (and if righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs be but a relation; and a relation, as <hi>Durandus, Dr. Twiſs,</hi> and many another thin be but <hi>Ens Rationis,</hi> then the ſpecies of an <hi>Ens Rationis</hi> is a very curious Web) Knowledge (as <hi>D'Orbellis</hi> ſaith in 2. <hi>ſent. Diſ.</hi> 3. <hi>q.</hi> 3.) is twofold, <hi>i. e. ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive</hi> and <hi>intellective</hi>; and each of theſe twofold, <hi>Intuitive</hi> and <hi>Abſtractive. Intuitive knowledge</hi> is indeed <hi>de objecto ut in ſe praeſens; quando ſcilicet res in propria exiſtentia eſt per ſe motiva: Exemplum de ſenſitiva eſt, ut viſus videt colorem</hi>: (yet this is but <hi>Recepiendo ſpeciem, non rem</hi>) and this is not it in queſtion): <hi>Exemplum de intellectiva eſt, ut viſio Divinae eſſentiae à beatis</hi>: This is utterly denyed to be at all by Doctor <hi>Stoughton, Camer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> and other ſolid Divines, againſt the School-mens judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And if it be, yet doubtleſs as we know not how, ſo it is not ſuch as faiths apprehenſion, which we enquire after, <hi>Cognitio Abſtractiva eſt quando ſpecies rei movet ad cognoſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum rem ipſam, &amp; hoc ſiveres ſit in ſe praeſens, ſive abſens, ſive exiſtat ſive non: Exemplum in ſenſitiva eſt, ut phantaſia imaginatur colorem: Exemplum in intellectiva eſt ut intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus cognoſcit quidditatem coloris medicante ejus ſpecie.</hi> So that if it be either of theſe, it were at the utmoſt but a paſſive rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the ſpecies, and not of Chriſt or his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. By what phyſical contact faith doth receive this? might be enquired: and 3. By what phyſical act of the Agent? to neither of which queſtions can I imagine what tolerable anſwer can be given, in defence of this cauſe.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. And if faith be a paſſive <hi>phyſical inſtrument,</hi> it muſt have a <hi>Phyſical Efficiency</hi>? and what is that? to juſtifie? why, even God himſelf in this life doth that but by a Moral Act (by his word) and not by a phyſical, (as to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.)</p>
                        <p n="3">3. But that which driveth me to the greateſt admiration is, How faith ſhould <hi>Efficere patiendo</hi>! If I ſhould rip up this,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:60968:117"/>
or require a demonſtration of it in reſpect to the juſtification at judgement, yea, or in this life, yea or of any effect, I ſhould lay ſuch an odium on it from its abſurdities, that in dealing with you, modeſty doth forbid me to inſiſt on it. 4. The fourth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite will be enquired after in the next Queſtion ſave one.</p>
                        <p>The fourth Queſtion is, <hi>Whether other Graces may not be as properly called phyſical paſſive Inſtruments as Faith, is your ſenſe</hi>?</p>
                        <p>And I doubt not but they may, (though its true of nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) For 1. If there be no phyſical reception of Chriſts righteouſneſs imaginable but that which is <hi>per modum ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecti,</hi> and if other gratious acts have Chriſts righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for their object, as well as that which you call faith: then other Acts do receive Chriſts righteouſneſs as well as ſaith: but both branches of the Antecedent are true, therefore the conſequence, the bare knowledge or ſimple apprehenſion of Chriſts righteouſneſs <hi>per modum objecti</hi> may better pretend to this, then recombency or affiance: Yea, and love it ſelf more fitly then affiance may be ſaid to receive or embrace its object (which is not therefore falſe neither becauſe <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath it: and you know he brings <hi>Auſtines</hi> plain words, affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing love to be the hand by which they received him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) I confeſs if I firſt renounce not the concurrent Judgement of Philoſophers, I cannot approve of the common Anſwer which our Divines give to <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in this, <hi>viz.</hi> [<hi>That Faith receiveth Chriſts Righteouſneſs firſt to make it ours, but Love only to retain it, and embrace and enjoy it when firſt we know it to be ours</hi>:] For though this ſay as much as I need to plead for, acknowledging Love to be as properly a phyſical Recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for retention, as Faith is for firſt Poſſeſsion, yet if affiance be taken in any proper ordinary ſence, it cannot thus hold good neither: for ſo <hi>Affiance</hi> muſt ſignifie ſome act of the will in order of nature after love, or at leaſt not before it. I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that ſo much of Faith as lyeth in the underſtanding is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Love in order of nature; <hi>ſicut ipſe intellectus eſt ſimpliciter prior voluntate, ut motivum mobili, &amp; activum paſſivo, ut</hi> Aquin. 1. q. <hi>§.</hi> 2. a. 3.2. <hi>and</hi> 12. q. 13. a. 1.

But ſtill I ſpeak not of Love as a Paſsion, but a true cloſure, as it were of the will with its Object as Good: and expect love to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the ſenſitive, and ſtrange to the intellective ſoul; we muſt make it the ſame with <hi>Velle:</hi> For <hi>Amor &amp; ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>The fifth Queſtion is, <hi>Whether Faith be any Inſtrument of our Juſtification?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Anſwer, <hi>Scotus</hi> gives many ſences of the word <hi>Inſtrument,</hi> and ſo doth <hi>Aquinas, Schibler,</hi> and moſt Philoſophers that meddle with it: and they give ſome ſo large, as contain all cauſes in the world under God the firſt cauſe; In ſo large a ſence, if any will call faith an Inſtrument of Juſtification, I will not contend with him; though yet I will not ſay ſo my ſelf, as judging faith to be no kind of cauſe of it at all; but in the proper ordinary ſence, as an Inſtrument, ſignifieth <hi>Cauſam quae influit in effectum per virtutem inferioris rationis, as</hi> Suarez, Stierius, Arniſaeus, &amp;c. <hi>Vel Inſtrumentum eſt quod ex directione alterius principalis agentis influit ad produce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>dum effectum ſe nobiliorem, ut</hi> Schibler, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So I utterly deny Faith to be an Inſtrument. But I will firſt queſtion whether it be a phyſical Inſtrument. 2. Whether a moral? 1. And for the firſt, I have done it already: for ſeeing our acute Divines have ceaſed to lay any claim to it as an <hi>active</hi> Inſtrument, but only as a <hi>Paſsive</hi>; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore having diſproved what they claim, I have done enough to that. 2. Yet I will add ſome more: And 1. If it be a phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical active Inſtrument, it muſt have a phyſical active Influx to
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:60968:118"/>
the producing of the Effect; but ſo hath not Faith to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of our Juſtification. <hi>Ergo</hi> &amp;c. The Major is apparent from the common definition of ſuch Inſtruments: The Minor will be as evident, if we conſider but what Gods Act in Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is, and then it would appear impoſſible that any act of ours ſhould be ſuch an Inſtrument. 1. At the great Juſtification at Judgement Chriſts act is to ſentence us acquit and diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and doth our Faith <hi>activè, ſixae influere ad hunc effectum</hi>? Doth it intervene between Chriſt and the effect? and ſo active<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly juſtifie us? Who will ſay ſo? 2. And the act by which God juſtifieth us here, is by a Deed of Gift in his Goſpel (as I Judge) Now 1. That doth immediately produce the effect (only ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing Faith as a condition.) 2. And it is but a moral Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental cauſe it ſelf, and how faith can be a Phyſical, I know not. 3. Nay the act is but a moral act, ſuch as a Statute or Bond acteth, and what need Faith to be a phyſical Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
                        <p n="2">2. My ſecond Reaſon is this: It is generally concluded, that <hi>Tota inſtrumenti cauſalit as eſt in uſu &amp; applicatione</hi>; It ceaſeth to be an Inſtrument, when it ceaſeth to be uſed or acted by the principal cauſe: But faith doth moſt frequently ceaſe its action, and is not uſed (phyſically) when we ſleep or wholly mind other things: Therefore according to this Doctrine, faith ſhould then ceaſe its Inſtrumentality; and conſequently either we ſhould all that while be unjuſtified and unpardoned, or elſe be juſtified and pardoned ſome other way, and not by faith. All which is abſurd; and eaſily avoided by diſcerning faith to be but a Condition of our Juſtification, or a <hi>Cauſa ſine quae non.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. If Faith be a <hi>phyſical Inſtrument,</hi> then it ſhould juſtifie from a reaſon <hi>intrinſecal, natural and eſſential</hi> to it, and not from Gods meer ordination of it to this office by his Word of Promiſe: but that were at leaſt dangerous Doctrine: and ſhould not be entertained by them who (truly) acknowledge that it juſtifies not as a work; much leſs then as a <hi>Phyſical</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception which they call its Inſtrumentality. The conſequence of the Major is evident, in that nothing can be more intrinſecal and eſſential to faith (this faith) then to be what it is, <hi>viz.</hi> a Reception or acceptance of Chriſt or his Righteouſneſs: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:60968:119"/>
if it juſtifie directly as ſuch, then it juſtifieth of its own Nature.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. It is to me a hard ſaying, that God and Faith do the ſame thing, that is, Pardon and juſtifie: and yet ſo they do if it be an Inſtrument of Juſtification: For <hi>eadem eſt Actio Inſtrumenti &amp; principalis cauſae,</hi> viz. <hi>quoad determinationem ad hunc ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectum, ut</hi> Aquinas, Schibler, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I dare not ſay or think, that Faith doth ſo properly, effectively juſtifie and pardon us.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. It ſeems to me needleſs to feign this Inſtrumentality, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>fruſtra fit per plura quod fieri poteſt per pauciora.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">6. Yea it derogateth from the work; for as <hi>Scotus</hi> ſaith, (in 4. diſt. 45. q. 1. pag. <hi>(mihi)</hi> 239. D.) <hi>Actio ſine inſtrumento eſt perfectior quàm actio cum inſtrumento.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="7">7. And this Doctrine makes man to be the <hi>cauſa proxima,</hi> of his own Pardon and Juſtification.

Deus nos baptizat &amp; paſcit, non noſmet ipſi: Nos credimus in Chriſtum, non Deus.</hi> Whether faith may be a moral Inſtrument, I ſhall enquire, when I have anſwered the next queſtion: which is, Q 6. <hi>If faith were ſuch a Phyſical Paſsive (or Active) Inſtrument, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that be the formal direct reaſon of its juſtifying? and whether (as it is) it do juſtifie directly and primarily,</hi> quatenus eſt appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſio Chriſti, juſtitioe, vel Juſtificationis. And this is it that I moſt confidently deny, and had rather you would ſtick to in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate then all the reſt: for I ground many other things on it. I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm therefore, 1. That faith juſtifieth primarily and directly, as the condition on which the free Donor hath beſtowed Chriſt, with all his benefits in the Goſpel-conveyance. 2. And that if it
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:60968:119"/>
were a meer Phyſical apprehenſion it would not juſtifie; no nor do us any good. 3. And that the apprehenſion called the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity which is truly its nature, is yet but its aptitude to its juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing office, and ſo a remote, &amp; not the direct proper formal cauſe.</p>
                        <p>Theſe three I will prove in order. 1. And for the firſt it is proved. 1. From the Tenor of the juſtifyn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>g Promiſe, which ſtill aſſureth Juſtification on the condition of Believing. <hi>[He that believeth]</hi> and <hi>[whoſoever believeth]</hi> and <hi>[if thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve]</hi> do plainly and unqueſtionably expreſs ſuch a condition, upon which we ſhall be juſtified, and without which we ſhall not. The <hi>Antinomians</hi> moſt unreaſonably deny this. 2. And the nature of Juſtification makes it unqueſtioinable: for whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you make it a Law-act, or an act of Gods own Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Will determining of our ſtate, yet nither will admit of any intervening cauſe, (eſpecially any act of ours,) but only a condition. 3. Beſides, Conditions depend on the will of him that beſtoweth the Gift, and according to his Will they ſucceed: but Inſtruments more according to their own fitneſs: Now it is known well, that Juſtification is an act of Gods meer free Grace and Will, and therefore nothing can further conduce to Gods free act as on our part, but by way of Condition. 4. And I need not ſay more to this, it being acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged generally by all our Divines, not one that I remember excepted, beſides Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> that <hi>[faith juſtifieth as the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Covenant]</hi> Mr. <hi>Wotton de Reconcil. part</hi> 1. <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 18. brings you the full Teſtimony of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Homilies, <hi>Fox, Perkins, Paraeus, Trelcatius, Dr. G.

Elſe <hi>Mary</hi> ſhould be juſtified for having Chriſt in her womb, as I ſaid before. 2. Elſe juſtification, as I ſaid, ſhould be aſcribed to the nature of the act of faith it ſelf. 3. You may ſee what is the primary, formal reaſon why faith Juſtifies, by its inſeparablility from the effect or event; and which is the improper remote cauſe by its ſeparability. Now ſuch a phyſical apprehenſion may be (as ſuch) ſeparated
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:60968:120"/>
from the effect, and would ſtill be if it had not the further na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a condition. We ſee it plainly in all worldly things. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man that takes in his hand a conveyance of land, ſhall not poſſeſs the land. If you forcibly ſeize upon all a mans eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and writings, you ſhall not therefore poſſeſs his eſtate. If a traytor ſnatch a pardon by violence out of anothers hand, he is not therefore pardoned. (But more of this under the next). 4. And for your paſſive faith, I cannot conceive how it ſhould (as paſſive) have any Moral good in it (as is ſaid,) much leſs juſtifie us. And ſo when God ſaith that without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God we ſhall feign that to be juſtifying faith, which hath nothing in it ſelf, that can pleaſe God: and how it can juſtifie that doth not pleaſe, I know not. I know <hi>in genere entis</hi> the Divels pleaſe God: They are his creatures; and naturally Good, as <hi>Ens &amp; bonum convertun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur</hi>: but <hi>in genere moris,</hi> I know not yet how <hi>pati quatenus pati</hi> can pleaſe him.

For as <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſaith, <hi>Malum in Patiente eſt vel ab imperfectione,

                        <p n="3">3. My third propoſition is, that the <hi>Receptivity or apprehenſion which is truly of the nature of faith, is yet but its aptitude to its Juſtifying office, and ſo a remote and not the direct proper formal reaſon</hi>: And this is the main point that I inſiſt on: And it is evident, in all that is ſaid already: and further thus, If faith had been of that apprehending nature as it is, and yet had not been made the condition in the gift or promiſe of God, it would not have juſtified: but if it had been made the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though it had been no apprehending (but as any other duty,) yet it would have juſtified: therefore it is evident that the neareſt, proper reaſon of its power to juſtifie is Gods ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it the condition of his gift, and its receptive nature is but a remote reaſon: 1. If faith would have juſtified, though it had not been a condition, then it muſt have juſtified againſt Gods will, which is impoſſible: It is God that juſtifieth, and therefore we cannot be a cauſe of his Action. 2. It is evident alſo from the nature of this moral reception, which being but a willingneſs and conſent, cannot of its own nature make the thing our own, but as it is by the meer will of the donor made the condition of his offer or gift. If I am willing to be Lord of any Lands or Countreys, it will not make me ſo: but if the true owner ſay, I will give them thee if thou wilt accept them, then it will be ſo: therefore it is not firſt and directly from the nature of the reception, but firſt becauſe that reception is made the condition of the gift. If a condemned man be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be pardoned, he ſhall not therefore be pardoned: but if a pardon be given on condition he be willing or accept it, then he ſhall have it. If a poor woman conſent to have a Prince for her husband, and ſo to have his poſſeſſions, it ſhall not therefore be done, except he give himſelf to her on condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her conſent. If it were a meer phyſical reception, and we ſpoke of a poſſeſſion <hi>de facto</hi> of ſomewhat that is ſo appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible, then it would be otherwiſe: as he that getteth gold or a pearl in his hand, he hath ſuch a poſſeſsion: But when it is but a moral improper reception (though <hi>per actum phyſicum volendi vel conſentiend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="218" facs="tcp:60968:121"/>
in right of Law, and of a relation and Title, then it muſt need; ſtand as aforeſaid. Donation, (or Imputation) being the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect cauſe of our firſt conſtitutive juſtification, therefore conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onality and not the natural receptivity of faith, muſt needs be the proper reaſon of its juſtifying. This is acknowledged by Divines: <hi>Ameſius</hi> ſaith, (<hi>Bellarm. Enervat. T.</hi> 4. <hi>p. (m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And that if any other ſort or act of faith, as well as this, or any other grace would have juſtified, if God had made it equally the condition of his gift, is alſo paſt all doubt. 1. Becauſe the whole work of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying dependeth meerly on Gods free Grace and will and thence it is that faith is deputed to its office. 2. Who doubteth but God could have beſtowed pardon and juſtification on other terms or conditions, if he would? 3. Yea who doubteth but he might have given them without any condition, even that of acceptance? Yea though we had never known that there had been a Redeemer, yet God might have juſtified us for his ſake. I ſpeak not what he may now do after he reſolved of a courſe in his Covenant: But doubtleſs he might have made the Covenant to be an abſolute promiſe without any conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on our part if he would, even ſuch as the <hi>Antinomians</hi> dream it to be. And me thinks thoſe great Divines, that ſay with <hi>Twiſſe, Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And doubtleſs that faith which the Iſraelites in the firſt ages were juſtified by, did much differ from ours now, whatever that doth which is required of poor Indians now; that never heard of Chriſt. 5 And God pardoneth and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth Infants, without any actual reception of pardon by their faith.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. And me thinks they that ſtand for the inſtrumentality of faith above all ſhould not deny this; for (according to my Logick) the formality of an Inſtrument is in its actual ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviency to the principal cauſe: and therefore it is no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger <hi>cauſa inſtrumentalis</hi> then it is uſed: and therefore whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

                        <p n="4">4.

But this is a vain fiction, it being the ſame believing in Chriſt, to which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Remiſsion, Juſtification, Adoption, Glorification, and all is made.</p>

our Righteouſneſs <hi>in ſenſu cauſali, ſed non in ſenſu formali.</hi> I conclude this with the plain Teſtimony of our beſt Writers. <hi>Perkins</hi> vol. 1. pag. 662. <hi>In the true Gain, ſaith: And leſt any ſhould imagine that the very Act of faith in apprehending Chriſt juſtifieth: we are to underſtand that faith doth not apprehend by Power from it ſelf, but by vertue of the Covenant. If a man believe the Kingdom of</hi> France <hi>to be his, it is not therefore his: yet if he belive Chriſt and the Kingdom of Heaven by Chriſt to be his, it is his indeed: not ſimply becauſe he believes, but becauſe he believes upon Commandment and Promiſe.</hi> (that is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly as an Inſtrument, but as a condition) <hi>For in the tenor of the Covenant God promiſeth to impute the Obedience of Chriſt to us for our Righteouſneſs if we believe.</hi> Is not this as plain as may be? So <hi>Bullinger Decad.</hi> 1. <hi>Serm.</hi> 6. <hi>p. (mihi)</hi> 44. <hi>We ſay faith juſtifieth for it ſelf, not as it is a quality in our mind, or our own work: but as faith is a gift of Gods grace, having the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of righteouſneſs and life,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Therefore faith juſtifieth for Chriſt, and from the grace and Covenant of God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This being therefore fully proved, that faith juſtifieth properly and directly as the <hi>condition</hi> on which God hath made over Chriſt and all his benefits in the Goſpel, the two great points oppoſed in my Doctrine do hence ariſe unavoidably. 1. That this faith juſtifieth as truly and directly as it is the receiving of Chriſt for Lord, and King, and Head, and Husband, as for a juſtifier, for both are equally the conditions in the Goſpel. But if the phyſical Inſtrumental way were ſound, then it would juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie only as it is a receiving of Juſtification or Juſtice. This is the main concluſion I conteſt for. Yield me this, and I will not ſo much ſtick at any of the reſt. 2. And hence it follows, that Repentance, forgiving others, love to Chriſt, Obedience Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical, do ſo far juſtifie as the Goſpel-promiſe makes them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; and no further do I plead for them.</p>

Yet if any will ſay that it is properly and principally a condition, and that it ſo juſtifieth; and yet that it may be called an Inſtrument moral in an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper ſence, as it is a condition firſt, or elſe in regard of its receiving uſe, will ſtretch the word <hi>Inſtrument</hi> ſo wide, as to apply it to it; I will not contend for a word, when we agree in ſence.

I know there is that kind of difficulty in Divine things which requireth the ſpiritual illumination of the underſtanding: but not ſuch in foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation points that neceſſarily requireth ſo much humane learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. 3. Your way hath not one word of Scripture for it: Where doth Scripture ſay (in phraſe or ſenſe) that <hi>faith Juſtifieth as an inſtrument; or that it is ſuch?

<pb n="224" facs="tcp:60968:124"/>
and eſpecially Lord: therefore receiving Chriſt is a willingneſs, conſent or acceptance of him for Redeemer and Lord, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.10. <hi>His own received him not</hi>; What is that but they refuſed him? and not that they wree not <hi>Paſſive phyſical receivers of Juſtice,</hi> Luke 19.27. <hi>Theſe mine enemies that would not I ſhould reign over them, bring hither and deſtroy, &amp;c.</hi> Then willingneſs of his reign is part of that faith which juſtifies: Even willingneſs of his Reign, as well as to be pardoned, juſtified and ſaved from Hell by him; (or elſe few among us would periſh; For I never met with the man that was unwilling of theſe.)</p>
                        <p n="3">3. And then it will eaſily appear, <hi>Whether your Doctrine or mine be the more ſafe.</hi> 1. Yours hath the many inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces already mentioned. It maketh man his own juſtifier, or the <hi>cauſa proxima</hi> of his own Juſtification, and by his own Act <hi>to help</hi> God to juſtifie us: for ſo all inſtruments do help the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal cauſe. And yet by a ſelf-contradiction it maketh faith to be of no Moral worth, and ſo no vertue or grace. Yea, (I think) it layeth the blame of mans infidelity on God; Many ſuch wayes it ſeemeth to wrong the Father and the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator. 2. And it ſeemeth alſo to wrong mens ſouls in point of ſafety, both by drawing them ſo to wrong God, and alſo by laying grounds to encourage them in preſumption; For when they are taught that the receiving of Chriſts righteouſneſs, or of Chriſt for juſtification, or the confident expectation of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, or reſting on Chriſt for it, or a particular perſwaſion of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Is juſtifying faith, and when they find theſe in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (as undoubtedly they may will this much, or elſe they cannot preſume), Is it not eaſie then to think they are ſafe when they are not? As I ſaid, I never yet met with the man that was not willing to be <hi>Juſtified and ſaved from Hell by Chriſt</hi>: and I dare ſay, <hi>Really</hi> willing: and but with few that did not <hi>expect</hi> it from Chriſt, and truſt him for it. Now to place Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying faith only in that which is ſo common, and to tell the men that yet they believe not truly when they have all that is made eſſential to faith, as Juſtifying, is ſtrange. For knowing that the godly themſelves have fowly ſinned, and that no man can periſh that hath Juſtifying faith, how can they chooſe but preſume when they find that which is called Juſtifying faith
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:60968:124"/>
undoubtedly in themſelves? And to tell them it is not ſincere or true, becauſe they receive not Chriſt alſo as King and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, and yet that ſuch receiving is no part of juſtifying faith. This is to tell them that the truth of their faith lyeth without it ſelf (a ſtrange Truth) in a ſignal concomitant: and who will doubt of his faith for want of a concomitant ſign, when he certainly feeleth the thing it ſelf? Will not ſuch think they may ſin <hi>ſalva fide</hi>? When as if they were rightly taught, that juſtifying ſaving faith (as ſuch) is the receiving of Chriſt for Saviour, and Lord, and ſo a giving up themſelves both to be ſaved and guided by him, then they would find that faith in Chriſt and ſincere obedience to Chriſt have a little neerer relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and then a man might ſay to ſuch a preſumer, as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>Tertullian</hi> excellently doth, <hi>De poenitent.

                        <p>Again, your Doctrine ſeemeth to me to overthrow the comfort of Believers exceedingly. For how can they have any comfort that know not whether they are juſtified and ſhall be ſaved? and how can they know that, who know not whether they have faith? and how can they know that, when they know not what juſtifying ſaith is? and how can they know what it is, when it is by Divines involved in ſuch a cloud and maze of difficulties? ſome placing it in this, act and ſome in that, and ſome in a Paſſive inſtrumentality, which few underſtand, (If any man in the world do.) For the Habit of faith, that cannot be felt or known of it ſelf immediately, but by
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:60968:125"/>
its acts (for ſo it is concluded of all Habits, <hi>Suarez, Metap. T.</hi> 2. <hi>diſp.</hi> 44 §. 1. <hi>pag</hi> 332.) and inſtead of the act we are now ſet to enquire after the paſſion? and ſo in the work of examination the buſineſs is to enquire, <hi>how and when we did paſſively receive righteouſneſs, or juſtification, or Chriſt for theſe?</hi> which let him anſwer for himſelf that can, for I cannot.</p>
                        <p>But now, on the other ſide, what inconvenience is there in the Doctrine of faith and juſtification as I deliver it? As it is plain, and certain (ſaying no more then is generally granted) ſo I think it is ſafe. Do I aſcribe any of Chriſts honour in the work to man? No man yet hath dared to charge me with that, to my knowledge: and no conſiderate man I believe will do it. I conclude that neither faith nor works is the leaſt part of our legal righteouſneſs: or of that righteouſneſs which we muſt plead againſt the accuſer for our juſtification: which is commonly called by Divines, the matter of our juſtification. The Law which we have broken cannot be ſatisfied (nor God for the breach of it) in the leaſt meaſure by our faith or obedience, nor do they concur as the leaſt degree of that ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: But we muſt turn the Law over wholly to our Surety. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whereas he hath made a new Law or Covenant containing the conditions on our part of the ſaid juſtification and ſalvation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſay, theſe conditions muſt needs be performed, and that by our ſelves: and who dare deny this? and I ſay that the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of theſe conditions is our <hi>Evangelical righteouſneſs</hi> (in reference to that Covenant,) as Chriſts ſatiſfaction is our legal Righteouſneſs (in reference to that firſt Covenant), or as perfect obedience would have been our legal righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, if we had ſo obeyed. And for them that ſpeak of inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Righteouſneſs in any other ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> as it is an imperfect conformity to the Law of works, rather then as a true confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the Law or Covenant of grace, I renounce their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, both as contradictory to it ſelf, and to the truth, and as that which would make the ſame Law to curſe and bleſs the ſame man, and which would ſet up the deſperate Doctrine of Juſtification by the works of the Law: For if men are righteous in reference to that Law, then they may be ſo far juſtified by it.</p>
                        <p>Nor do I aſcribe to works any part of the office or honour of
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:60968:125"/>
faith (Though that were not ſo dangerous as to derogate from Chriſt.) For I acknowledge faith the only condition of our firſt Remiſſion and juſtification: and the principal part of the condition of our juſtification as continued and conſummate. And if faith be an inſtrumental cauſe, I do not give that honor from it to works, for they are not ſo: Nay, I boldly again aver, that I give no more to <hi>obedience to Chriſt,</hi> then Divines ordinarily do, that is, to be the ſecondary part of the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of continued and conſummate juſtification. Only I give not ſo much as others to faith, becauſe I dare not aſcribe ſo much to man. And yet men make ſuch a noiſe with the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble name of <hi>Juſtification by works</hi> (the Lords own phraſe), as if I gave more then themſelves to man, when I give ſo much leſs.</p>
                        <p>And thus Sir, I have according to your advice, ſpent my ſelf (as you ſpeak) in aiming at that mark which you were plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſet me. And now I ſhall proceed to the reſt of your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions.</p>
                        <p>My next anſwer to you was, that [<hi>If works under every no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are excluded (as you ſay they are) then repentance is exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded under the notion of a condition or preparative: But repentance under that notion is not excluded: Therefore not works under every notion.</hi> To this you reply, that <hi>[Repentance is not excluded as qualifying, but as recipient,]</hi> which what is it but a plain yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Minor, and ſo the cauſe: For this is as much as I ſay. If repentance be a work or act of ours, and not excluded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the notion of a qualification, (or as you elſewhere yield) a <hi>Medium ordinatum,</hi> and a condition, then works are not under every notion excluded. And that repentance is not reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pient, how eaſily do I yeild to you? But do you indeed think that when <hi>Paul</hi> excludeth the works of the Law, that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth them only as Recipient? and not as qualifying? If ſo, (as this anſwer ſeems to import, ſeeing you will not have me here diſtinguiſh between works of Law, and of Goſpel, or New Covenant) then you give abundance more to works of the Law then I do or dare: For I aver that <hi>Paul</hi> excludeth them even as qualifications, yea and the very preſence of them: and that the Jews never dreamt of their works being Recipient.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="228" facs="tcp:60968:126"/>To my next you ſay, <hi>[Whether Paul diſpute what is our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, or upon what terms it is made ours it doth not much mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter]</hi> But I think it of very great moment; they being Queſtions ſo very much different, both in their ſenſe, and importance. And whereas you think <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks chiefly of the manner, I think he ſpeaks of both, but primarily of the <hi>(quaſi) materia</hi>; and of the manner or means thereto, but ſecondarily in reference to that. So that I think the chief Queſtion which <hi>Paul</hi> doth debate, was, <hi>Whether we are Juſtified by our own works or merits, or by Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, viz.</hi> the ſatisfaction of a ſurety? which yet becauſe it is no way made ours but by believing, therefore he ſo puts the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whether by works of the Law, or by faith? and ſo that he makes them two immediate oppoſites not granting any <hi>tertium,</hi> I eaſily yield. <hi>(But of that before.)</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To the next you ſay, that <hi>[I cannot find ſuch a figure for faith Relatively in my ſenſe.] Anſw.</hi> And I conceive that faith in my ſenſe may be taken Relatively full as well as in yours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Doubtleſs acceptance of an offered Redeemer and all his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits doth relate as properly to what is accepted (<hi>viz.</hi> by the aſſent of the underſtanding initially, and by the election and conſent of the will conſummately) as a <hi>Phyſical Paſſive recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or inſtrumentality</hi> can do. And alſo as it is a condition I make little doubt, but it relateth to the thing given on that condition: and that the very name of a condition is relative. So that in my ſenſe faith relateth to Chriſt two ways: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the former is but its very nature, and ſo its aptitude to its office: The later is that proper reſpect in which it immediately or directly juſtifieth. Yet do I not mean as you ſeem to do, as I gather by your phraſe of <hi>[putting Love and Obedience for Chriſts Righteouſneſs]:</hi> For I conceive it may be put relatively, and yet not ſtrictly <hi>(loco correlati)</hi> for the thing related to: when I ſay my hands or teeth feed me, I do not put them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of my Meat; and yet I uſe the words relatively, mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Meat principally, and my teeth ſecondarily: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do I mean that it relateth to Chriſts <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> only or principally; but firſt to <hi>himſelf.</hi> And I doubt not but <hi>Love</hi> to Chriſt and Obedience to him as Redeemer, do relate to him: but not ſo fully, clearly and directly expreſs him as related to, as <hi>Faith</hi>: Faith being alſo ſo comprehenſive a grace as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:60968:126"/>
ſome others. It is a true ſaying, that a poor woman that is marryrd to a Prince is <hi>made honourable by love,</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſo by duty to her husband:</hi> But it is more obſcure and improper then to ſay, ſhe is made <hi>honourable by Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,</hi> or taking ſuch a man to her husband, which includes love, and implyeth duty and faithfulneſs, as neceſſarily ſubſequent. I conceive with Judicious <hi>Doctor Preſton,</hi> that faith is truly and properly ſuch a conſent, contract, or marriage with Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>Next to your ſimilitude: you ſay <hi>[that I hold that not only ſeeing this brazen Serpent, but any other Actions of ſenſe, will as well heal the wounded Chriſtian.]</hi> To which I anſwer. Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes run not on all four. Thus far I believe that this holds. 1. Chriſt was lift up on the Croſs as the brazen Serpent was lift up. 2. He was lift up for a cure to ſin-ſtung ſouls, as the brazen Serpent for the ſtung bodies. 3. That as every one that look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Serpent was cured (an eaſie condition,) ſo every one that believeth Chriſt to be the appointed Redeemer, and heartily Accepteth him on the terms he is offered, and ſo truſteth in him, ſhall not periſh, but have everlaſting life. 4. That as the cure of their bodies came not from any natural reaſon drawn from the eye, or from any natural excellency or efficacy of ſeeing, above hearing or feeling, but meerly from the free will and pleaſure of God, who ordained that looking ſhould be the condition of their cure: So all thoſe Acts (uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally comprized or implyed in the word believing) which juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, do it not from any natural excellency, efficacy or inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentality, but meerly from the good pleaſure of the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver: And therefore the natural Receptivity of Faith (that is its very formal eſſence) muſt not be given as the proper direct cauſe of its Juſtifying: But that is, its conditionality from the free appointment of God.</p>
                        <p>But on the other ſide, 1. It was only one Act of one ſenſe which was the condition of their cure: but you will not ſay I believe that it is only one act of one faculty which juſtifieth: however I will not. 2. It was the Act of ſeeing which cured them, without touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, laying hold on, apprehending, reſting on, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But you will not ſay ſo of juſtifying faith. 3. The ſight, which was the condition of their cure, was no actuall reception of the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:60968:127"/>
Serpent, but the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of that Serpent by the eye; and ſo the eye did no otherwiſe receive the Serpent, then it received every Object it behold, even the Serpent that ſtung them. But if you ſay, that our receiving Chriſt is but <hi>per ſimplicem appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſionem objecti,</hi> and that it is a receiving of his <hi>ſpecies,</hi> and ſo that we receive Chriſt no otherwiſe then we receive Satan, or any Object of Knowledge, I will not be of that opinion. 4. Their cure was <hi>ſimul &amp; ſemel</hi>: but our Juſtification is a continued Act; as really in doing all our lives, as at firſt. 5 Therefore though one act finiſhed their cure, and there was no condition perſcribed as requiſite for the conſummation or continuance: yet when our Juſtification is begun, and we truly juſtified, there is further conditions preſcribed for its continuance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation. To conclude, I am ſo far from ſaying, that any other Act will as well heal the wounded Chriſtian, beſides what God hath made the expreſs condition of his cure, that I flatly aver no other will do it. But whether he hath made any one ſingle act (or Paſsion) to be the whole of that condition, I have elſewhere out of Scripture ſhewed you, and you do not deny what I ſay.</p>

                        <p>You next tell me that <hi>I cannot take the Aſſemblies definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in that ſence as they declare it, or the Scripture words, which are Metaphorical imply: for its the reſting of a burdened ſoul upon Chriſt only for Righteouſneſs; and by this Chriſts Righteouſneſs is made over to us; and its a receiving of Chriſt as the hand em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth any Object, &amp;c.</hi> Anſwer. That the word <hi>Receiving</hi> and <hi>Reſting</hi> are Metaphorical, I eaſily grant you; and wonder the more that you ſtill inſiſt on them, and inſtead of reducing them to more proper expreſsions, do here add Metaphor to Metaphor, till all your definition be a meer Allegory, when you
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:60968:127"/>
know how much Metaphors do ſeduce. But for the Aſſemblies Definition. I embrace it unfeignedly in that ſence as the words ſeem to me moſt evidently to import, without uſing violence with them. But I perceive by this, that you will not think it enough in a man to ſubſcribe to national Confeſsions and Catechiſms in the obvious ſence, or that which he judgeth the plain proper ſence, except he alſo agree with you in the explication. Some think it not enough that we ſubſcribe to the Scripture, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we may miſunderſtand it, and therefore we muſt ſubſcribe to national Confeſſions, as more explicate: (which I like well, ſo we add nothing to Gods word, nor thruſt our own Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries into the Text, or obtrude out own Doctrines upon men as Articles of their faith, or at leaſt, as the Biſhops did the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, which they made indifferent in word, but neceſſary indeed:) But now I perceive the matter comes all to one in the iſſue; when you cannot make a definition of Faith in ſuch Language as is any eaſier to be underſtood then the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: when you and I cannot both underſtand it: and I find that many are of <hi>Bellarmines</hi> judgement (<hi>Apol. c.</hi> 7. cited by Mr. <hi>Vines</hi> in his Sermon againſt <hi>Haereſ. pag.</hi> 50.) That a man may be an <hi>Haeretick</hi> though he believe the Scriptures, the three Creeds, and the four great general Councils. But for the ſence of the Aſſemblies definition, 1 I know not what you mean by the words [<hi>as they declare it</hi>:] If any private declaration, I am not to take notice of it, nor do I know what it meaneth, and could wiſh they would do, or might have done as Mr. <hi>Vines</hi> deſired in his Sermon, <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But if you mean only what is declared in the words of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition, I am moſt confident, though I never was in the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, that I have hit on their ſence far neerer then you ſeem to have done: and I dare not think otherwiſe, leſt I be hainouſly
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:60968:128"/>
cenſorious of ſo reverend an Aſſembly, which I am reſolved not to be. 1. Their very words are a <hi>receiving of Chriſt,</hi> and not immediately and primarily his <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> but himſelf; and in the confeſſion they ſay as I do, that it is an accepting, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving and reſting on Chriſt. 2. And as <hi>Chriſt</hi> the anointed, which Name ſignifieth the Offices which he is anointed to, <hi>viz.</hi> King, Prieſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. It maketh it to conſiſt in no one act, but ſeveral, expreſſed in two phraſes: 1. Receiving Chriſt. 2. Reſting on him alone for ſalvation. 4. It expreſly ſaith, that it is <hi>a receiving of him, as he is offered in the Goſpel,</hi> and that is, not as a juſtifier only, but as a Lord and Prophet, and that as immediately as the other, and conjunct with it: for he is no where offered as a juſtifier alone; if he be, ſhew where it is. 5. And hence it is plain that they mean no Reception but moral, by Willing, Conſenting, Accepting (as they expreſly ſay in the confeſſion of Faith) For he is no otherwiſe offered to us in the Goſpel: He is not offered to our Phyſical Reception. It is not his perſon in ſubſtance that is offered to the Contact of our Spirits, much leſs of our fleſh; but his perſon as cloathed with his Relations, of Mediator, Redeemer, Lord, Saviour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And can you receive a King, as King, (who is perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtant or inviſible) by any other Reception then I have ſaid? If we do receive a King into <hi>England,</hi> the only Acts of the ſoul are <hi>hearty conſenting,</hi> and what is therein and thereto im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed: though bodily Actions may follow: (which as to Chriſt we cannot perform.) I think verily this is the plain ſound ſence of the Aſſembly, and ſhall believe ſo, till the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, that thus defined, do otherwiſe interpret their own defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition.</p>
                        <p>And for your phraſe of <hi>[Reſting a burdened ſoul on Chriſt for Righteouſneſs]</hi> I doubt not as it intendeth Affiance, but it is as <hi>Perkins,</hi> Dr. <hi>Downam, Rob. Baronius, &amp;c.</hi> ſay, a fruit Of faith ſtrictly taken, rather then faith it ſelf: but if you take faith in a larger ſence (as the Goſpel not ſeldom doth, and againſt which I am no adverſary) ſo Affiance is part of faith it ſelf. But that it is the whole of that faith, I ſhall never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve without ſtronger Arguments; where you ſay, <hi>[Its the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Chriſt as the hand embraceth any Object.]</hi> I anſwer.
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:60968:128"/>
1. I am glad you here grant Chriſt himſelf to be the Object. 2. If you mean, <hi>[as verily as the hand, &amp;c.]</hi> So I grant it, if a moral receiving may be properly ſaid to be as true as a phyſical. But if you mean <hi>By a Phyſical Contact and Reception as the hand doth, &amp;c.</hi> then I am far from believing that ever Chriſt or our Aſſembly ſo meant, or ever had ſo groſs a thought. Where you ſay, <hi>I take it not the in ſence as the Scripture words imply</hi>;] I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. When I ſee that manifeſted I ſhall believe it. When it is ſaid <hi>John</hi> 1. <hi>He came to his own, and his own received him not</hi>: 1. Is it meant they took him not in their hands, or received not his Perſon into their houſes? the later is true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But 1. Only in a ſecond place; but their hearts were the firſt Receptacle 2. Elſe thoſe were no Unbelievers where Chriſt never came in perſon; And that had no houſes; 3. And that receiving cannot belong to us that never ſaw him, nor to any ſince his Aſcenſion. 2. Or is it the Intellective Reception of his <hi>ſpecies</hi>? I trow not: I have ſaid enough of that before. 3. Or is it a moral Recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of him as thus and thus related, <hi>volendo, eligendo, conſentiendo, diligendo</hi> (pardon this laſt, it is but the qualification of the reſt) <hi>&amp; conſequenter fidendo?</hi> I think this is it. If you can find a fourth way, you will do that which was never done (to my knowledge) and then you will be a Novelliſt as well, as I.</p>
                        <p>For your next expreſſions, I anſwer to them, that you do truly apprehend that I am loth to ſeem to recede from others, (and as loth to do it, but <hi>magis amica veritas</hi>: And I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not believe what my liſt, nor like thoſe that can.) By which you may truly know, that I do it not out of affectation of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity (as he knoweth that knoweth my heart), nor intend to be any inſtrument of diviſion in the Church. And if my aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions are deſtructive of what others deliver, it is but what ſome men, and not what all deliver: Not againſt the Aſſembly, nor many learned Divines who from ſeveral parts of the Land have ſignified to me their Aſſent: beſides all thoſe great names that appear for me in print.</p>
                        <p>But you tell me that <hi>[I may not build on ſome Homilitical popular expreſſions in any mans books.] Anſwer,</hi> Let me again name to you but the men I laſt named, and try whether you
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:60968:129"/>
will again ſo entitle their writings. The firſt and chief is Dr. <hi>Preſton,</hi> who was known to be a man of moſt choice notions, and ſo Judged by thoſe that put out his books, and his credit ſo great in <hi>England,</hi> that he cracks his own that ſeeks to crack it. And his Sermons were preached before as judicious an Audito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry (at leaſt) as your Lectures, and yet you defend your own expreſſions. Yea it is not once nor twice, not five times only, but almoſt through all his Books, that Dr. <hi>Preſton</hi> harpeth upon this ſtring, as if it were the choiſeſt notion that he intended to diſcloſe. Yea it is in his very Definition of faith as juſtifying; and Dr. <hi>Preſton</hi> was no homiletical Definer. I can produce the like Teſtimony of Dr. <hi>Stoughton:</hi> (two as great Divines in my eſteem as moſt ever <hi>England</hi> or the world bred.) Another is Mr. <hi>Wallis</hi>: Doubtleſs, Sir, no homiletical popular man in Writing: nor could you have quickly bethought you of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Book that leſs deſerves thoſe attributes: His words are theſe. <hi>I aſſent not to place the ſaving Act of faith, either with Mr.</hi> Cotton <hi>(as his Lordſhip cites him) in the laying hold of, or aſſenting to that Promiſe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>nor yet in a particular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Chriſt to my ſelf in aſſurance, or a believing that Chriſt is mine,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But I chooſe rather to place it in an act of the Will, then in either of theſe forenamed acts of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding. It is an Accepting of Chriſt offered, rather then an Aſſenting to a propoſition affirmed. To as many as received him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that is, to them that believe in his name.</hi> John 1. <hi>God makes an Offer of Chriſt to all (elſe ſhould not Reprobates be condemned for not accepting of him, as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Devils are, becauſe he was not offered to them.) Whoſoever will, let him come and take of the water of life freely,</hi> Rev. 22.17. <hi>Whereupon the believing ſoul replies, I will: and ſo takes him. When a Gift is offered to me, that which maketh it to be mine is my Acceptation,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If you call this taking of Chriſt (or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenting that Chriſt ſhall be my Saviour) a Depending, a Reſting or relying on Chriſt for ſalvation (if you ſpeak of an act of the Will) it is all one; for Taking of Chriſt to be my Saviour, and committing my ſelf to Chriſt to be ſaved, is the ſame: Both of them being but a conſenting to this Covenant, I will be your God, and you ſhall be my People,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And if you make this the ſaving Act of faith, then will Repentance (ſo far as it is diſtinct from Faith) be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:60968:129"/>
of it: Confidence alſo, &amp;c.</hi> Thus Mr. <hi>Wallis</hi> is clear, that the Nature of Faith is the ſame that I have affirmed, and in no popular Sermon, but in his <hi>Truth tryed. pag.</hi> 94, 95. And on theſe grounds he well anſwers <hi>Bellarmines Dilemma,</hi> which elſe will be but ſhiftingly anſwered. The next is Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> of New <hi>England,</hi> a man judged one of their beſt Diſputants, or elſe they would not have choſe him to encounter <hi>Apolloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us:</hi> And will you call his very Definition of Faith in an accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Catechiſm, an homiletical popular expreſſion? What then in the whole world ſhall eſcape that cenſure? His Words are: [Queſt. <hi>What is juſtifying Faith?</hi> Anſw. <hi>It is a ſaving grace of the Spirit, flowing from Election, whereby the ſoul receiveth Jeſus Chriſt, as its Head and Saviour, according as he is revealed in the Goſpel.</hi>] I ſubſcribe to this Definition from my heart. The next cited was Mr. <hi>Culverwell,</hi> not in any popular Sermon, but in a ſolid well approved Treatiſe of Faith, and not in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon paſſages, but his very definition of faith, <hi>pag.</hi> 13.17. and after all concludes. <hi>pag.</hi> 19. <hi>[Thus we ſee that the very nature of faith, conſiſteth in the true Acceptation of Chriſt proclaimed in the Goſpel]</hi> The next I cited (about the Definition of faith) was Mr. <hi>Throgmorton,</hi> who in his accurate Treatiſe of Faith (and not in any popular Sermons) and that many times over, doth make Faith to be the <hi>receiving Chriſt for Prophet, and only</hi> Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi, <hi>to be his Diſciples, and as the only Way and Truth, and alſo as King, Head, Husband, Prieſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and by this we are made Partakers of him and all his benefits. pag.</hi> 6.29.31.82. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And for the great point that you ſtick at of Juſtification, I will repeat the words of two of thoſe Authors which I have named: And 1.

As faith in Chriſt is not only the Aſſenting of a mans mind that Chriſt is the Saviour, but a reſultancy of the Will on Chriſt as a Saviour, embracing of him, and loving, eſteeming and honouring him as a Saviour. The Scripture comprehends both theſe together, and there is a rule for it, which the</hi> Rabbins <hi>give for the opening of the Scripture,</hi> viz. <hi>Verba ſenſus etiam denotant af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectus, as</hi> Jo. 17.3. <hi>This is eternal life to know thee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>It is not bare Knowledge the Scripture means, but Knowledge joined with affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</hi>] You ſee Dr. <hi>Stoughton</hi> took Love to be full as near Kin to Faith as I do. Many the like and more full in him I paſs. I cited in my Append. <hi>Alſtedius, Junius, Paraeus, Scharpius, Aretius, Ball,</hi> &amp;c. making <hi>Faith, &amp; Obedience, &amp; Gratitude Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the new Covenant</hi> (&amp; who ſaith not the ſame?) If all theſe be <hi>homiletical and popular,</hi> I much miſtake them; which yet I cite not as if no words might be found in any of theſe Authors that ſeem to ſpeak otherwiſe; but to ſhew that I am not wholly ſingular, (Though if I were, I cannot help it when I will.)</p>
                        <p>On the next Q. <hi>Whether a dying man may look on his Faith and Obedience, &amp; Duty as the condition of the N. Cov. by him perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>? You would perſwade me that I cannot think that I ſpeak to the point in this: but you are miſtaken in me: for I can miſtake more then that comes to: and indeed I yet think I ſpoke as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to the queſtion in your terms laid down, as was poſsible: for I changed not one of your terms, but mentioned the Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative as your ſelf expreſſed it: If you did mean otherwiſe then you ſpoke, I knew not that, nor can yet any better underſtand you. Only I can feel that all the difference between you and me muſt be decided by diſtinguiſhing of <hi>[Conditions</hi>:] but you never yet go about it ſo as I can underſtand you. You here ask me, <hi>[Whether I think you deny a godly life to be a comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

Teſtimony, or neceſſary qualification of a man for pardon?]</hi> Anſwer. 1. But the Queſtion is not of the <hi>ſignificancy</hi> or <hi>Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> nor yet of all kind of qualification; that is an ambiguous term, and was not in the Queſtion, but of the conditionality. 2. You yield to the term <hi>Condition</hi> your ſelf elſewhere, and therefore need not ſhun it. 3. Qualifications and Conditions are either phyſical and remote, of which I raiſe no queſtion: ſo the Eſſence of the ſoul is a condition, and ſo hearing the Goſpel is a natural Condition of him that will underſtand it; and underſtanding is a natural Qualification of him that will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it: For <hi>ignoti nulla fides.</hi> But it is another ſort of condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions you know that we are in ſpeech of, which I have defined, and Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> before cited: <hi>viz. Moral legal conditions</hi> ſo called <hi>in ſenſu forenſi vel legali</hi>: when the Law of Chriſt hangs our actual Juſtification and ſalvation on the doing or not doing ſuch a thing. Yet do I very much diſtinguiſh between the Nature and Uſes of the ſeveral Graces or Duties contained in the conditions; for though they are all conditions, yet they were not all for the ſame reaſon, or to the ſame uſe ordained to be conditions: but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance in one ſence as preparatory to faith: and Faith. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it honoureth Chriſt, and debaſeth our ſelves. 2. Becauſe it being in the full an Acceptation of the thing offered, is the moſt convenient means to make us Poſſeſſors without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the Gift; with other reaſons that might be found: So I might aſſign the reaſons (as they appear to us) why God hath aſſigned Love to Chriſt, and ſincere Obedience, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving others, their ſeveral parts and places in this conditionali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; (but I have done it in my Aphoriſms;) but then all theſe are drawn from the diſtinct nature and uſe of theſe duties Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially in themſelves conſidered, which is but their Aptitude for the place or conditionality which they are appointed to, and would of themſelves have done nothing without ſuch appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. So that it is one queſtion to ask, <hi>Why doth Faith or Works of Obedience to Chriſt Juſtifie</hi>? (To which I anſwer; Becauſe it was the pleaſure of God to make them the conditions of the Covenant, and not becauſe of their own nature directly:) and its another Queſtion, <hi>Why did God chooſe Faith to the Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency in this work</hi>? To which I anſwer. 1. Properly there is no cauſe of Gods actions without himſelf. 2. But ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:60968:133"/>
of him after the manner of men, as we muſt do, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Faith is fitter then any other Grace for this Honor and Office, as being both a high honouring of God, by believing him (thats as for Aſſent) and in its own Eſſential nature, a hearty thankfull Acceptance of his Son, both to be our Lord (which is both for the Honor of God and our own good) and our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to deliver and glorifie us: and ſo is the moſt rational way that man can imagine to make us partakers of the procured hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, without either our own danger (if a heavier condition had been laid upon us) or the diſhonour of the Mediator: ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by diminiſhing the eſtimation of the favour (if we had done any more to the procuring it our ſelves) or by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the Gift, (if we had not been required and conditioned with ſo much as thankfully and lovingly to accept it.) And then if the Queſtion be, <hi>Why God hath aſſigned ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere. Obedience and Perſeverance therein to that place of ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary Conditionality for the continuance and conſummation of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, and for the attaining of ſalvation?</hi> I anſwer. Not becauſe they have any ſuch Receptive nature as faith, but becauſe Faith being an Acceptance of Chriſt as Lord alſo, and delivering and reſigning up the ſoul to him accordingly in Covenant, this Duty is therefore neceſſarily implyed, as the thing promiſed by us in that Covenant, and ſo in ſome ſence greater then the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanting it ſelf, or the end of it: and Chriſt never intended to turn man out of his ſervice, and diſcharge him from Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; but to lay on him an eaſier and lighter yoak and burden, to learn of him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore well may he make this the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of their finding Eaſe and Reſt to their ſouls, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28, 29. For, for this end he dyed, that he might be Lord, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.9. And therefore when we are freely pardoned, &amp; bought from hell, it is equal that Chriſt ſhould rule us, who bought us, and that his Covenant hang till the continuance of our Legal title to pardon juſtification, and glory, and ſo the full poſſeſſion of them upon this perſeverance in ſincere loving grateful ſubjection to him that bought us, and by him to the Father. And thus Sir, I have digreſſed and uſed many words on this, (which to you I think needleſs) not only becauſe I perceive that you acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the conditionality of obedience in ſome ſenſe, but tell me
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:60968:134"/>
not in what ſenſe, but leſt you ſhould not diſcern my ſenſe, who deſire to ſpeak as plain as I can, that you may truly ſee where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we differ: And that I alſo may ſee it when you have as clearly opened your meaning of your term, <hi>[Qualifications.]</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And for your Queſtion <hi>[Whether a godly man can think the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt made his by working, or only believing.]</hi> I anſwer, cauſally and efficiently by neither, I think, (though you think otherwiſe); I dare not ſo advance faith, and ſo advance man. I remember good, old, learned, ſolid <hi>Gata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> words to <hi>Saltmarſh (pag.</hi> 53,) <hi>It is your ſelf rather then any of us that trip at this ſtone, when you would have faith ſo much preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Doctrine of ſalvation, in regard of the gloriouſneſs and eminency of the grace it ſelf; which to aſſert, is not ſound: (ſic in Animadv in Lucium part.</hi> 1. §. 9. <hi>v.</hi> 7.) The righteouſneſs of Chriſt is made ours by Gods free gift; but faith and true ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection are conditions of our participation; and what intereſt each hath in the conditionality, and on what grounds, I have ſhewed. I fear you give too much to faith and man.</p>
                        <p>You ask <hi>[Is it repent, and Chriſts righteouſneſs by this is made yours?] Anſwer,</hi> It is oftimes, <hi>Repent and be forgiven; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and be baptized; and repent and believe, and be forgiven</hi>: but not <hi>efficiently by repenting</hi> nor <hi>believing:</hi> but on <hi>condition</hi> of both: though in ordaining them conditions God might intend one but as preparative or ſubſervient to the other; and not one equal terms, or to equal uſe immediately.</p>
                        <p>And when you ſay, <hi>[that the dying Chriſtian is directed to the Reſting on Chriſt, and e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="245" facs="tcp:60968:134"/>
ſhape of man, had we lived in thoſe times, when the Doctrine of faith came not with thoſe advantages as now it doth.) And then it is an act of willing, conſenting, electing, affecting (which three are but a <hi>velle Reſpectivum,</hi> and ſo in the act all one): in this in order of nature goes before any act which you can in any reaſonable propriety call Dependance: and I doubt not are far more eſſential to juſtifying faith: yet I am heartily willing to take your acts of dependance (for thoſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo are more then one) in the next place. But it confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and abuſeth us and the Church in this controverſie, that many learned Divines will needs ſhun the ſtrict Philoſophical names of the ſeveral Acts of the ſoul, and overlook alſo the natural order of the ſouls motions, and they will uſe, and ſtil uſe the Metaphorical expreſſions, as <hi>apprehenſion</hi> (improper) <hi>dependance, relying, reſting, recombency, adherence, embracing,</hi> with more the like. I know Scripture uſeth ſome of theſe: but then it is not in ſtrict diſputing, as <hi>Joh. Crocius</hi> tels <hi>Bellarm.</hi> We may uſe <hi>apprehend</hi> figuratively, becauſe Scripture ſaith, <hi>apprehendite diſciplinans,</hi> and lay hold on eternal life: But this would quickly end diſputation, or elſe make it endleſs. Yet in the places cited, who knows not the ſame word hath different ſenſes? in the former being uſed for to accept and ſtoop to: in the later for an earneſt preſſing on, and endeavouring after as a runner to catch the prize. And they will be loth to ſay, theſe are all and each of them the juſtifying acts.</p>
                        <p>And where you add that <hi>its not an act of obedience.</hi> I anſwer, 1. I would you had firſt anſwered the many Scriptures to the contrary produced in my Aphor. 2.

and convincingly againſt you. And ſo is the ſecond <hi>Pſalm</hi> whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which makes ſubjection to Chriſt as King, the great part of the Goſpel condition. <hi>[Kiſs the ſon]</hi> conteineth more then <hi>Recombency,</hi> in my judgement: and yet no more then that true faith which is the condition of juſtification.</p>
                        <p>But no word in your paper brings me to ſuch a ſtand as your next, where you ſay, <hi>And that is very harſh ſtill which you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, to expect the Righteouſneſs of the Covenant of Grace up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the conditions fulfilled by your ſelf, through Gods workings.</hi>] Anſw. Truly it is quite beyond my ſhallow capacity to reach what you here mean to be ſo harſh: what ſhould I imagine? That there are conditions upon which the Tenor of the Goſpel gives Chriſt Righteouſneſs, you acknowldge: And that he that performeth them not, the Goſpel giveth him none of it: I know you confeſs theſe; And that we muſt needs perform them our ſelves, through Gods workings (<hi>i. e.</hi> both enablement and excitation, and co-operation:) I know you doubt of none of theſe; for you have wrote againſt the <hi>Antinomians</hi>: and Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> hath evinced the ſottiſh ignorance or impudency of <hi>Saltmarſh,</hi> in denying Faith, Repentance and Obedience to be the conditions on which, performed by us, we muſt enjoy the things promiſed, Pardon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or elſe not. Yea in this paper you yield to this conditionality. What then is the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? Is it harſh when yet you never once ſhew the fault of the Speech? It muſt be either the falſhood, or the unfitneſs; but you have yet accuſed it of neither: and yet ſay it is harſh.</p>
                        <p>But the reaſon you intimate, becauſe <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath ſome ſuch phraſe: which I never remembred or obſerved in him: and little do I care whether he have or no: If the <hi>Papiſts</hi> be nearer to us then I take them to be, it is cauſe of joy and not ſorrow: But ſure I am that Proteſtant Writers generally uſe the word <hi>Condition</hi>; and <hi>Wendeline</hi> ſaith, The <hi>Papiſts</hi> abuſe us in feigning us to ſay the <hi>Goſpel is abſolute</hi>; and ſaith, the <hi>Goſpel in each ſence is conditional. In one ſence Faith is the Condition; in another, Faith and Obedience, &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But here you come again to the Labyrinth and tranſcendent Myſterie of <hi>paſſive Faith</hi>: nay you enlarge the Myſterie yet more: 1. You ſay again, [<hi>Faith doth</hi> pati. 2. <hi>And yet Love
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:60968:137"/>
doth</hi> agere. 3. <hi>Elſe you would yield that</hi> Bellarmine <hi>argues con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonantly enough, that Love would juſtifie as well as Faith.</hi> 4. <hi>Yet you acknowledge Faith an Active Grace: but only in this Act its meerrecipient.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſwer.</hi> I confeſs my reaſon utterly at a loſs in this; but yet if it were in my Bible (to me Intelligible) I would believe it as I do the Doctrine of the Trinity, and ceaſe enquiring. But I cannot ſo do by any Creature, to make him the Lord of my faith and Reaſon. 1. Whether Faith doth <hi>Pati,</hi> I have enquired already. 2. That Love doth <hi>Agere,</hi> I verily believe: and yet I have ofter heard Love called a <hi>Paſſion,</hi> then <hi>Faith</hi>: And as <hi>Keckeram</hi> ſaith, <hi>the Affections are more Paſſive then the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent Elicit Acts of the Intellect and Will.</hi> And though as it is in the Rational ſoul, Love, (ſaith <hi>Aquin.</hi>) is no <hi>Paſsion,</hi> but a <hi>Willing</hi> (which cauſeth me to judge it ſo near Kin to Faith) yet as it is in the ſenſitive, it is a <hi>Paſsion.</hi> So that I am quite beyond doubt that phyſically love is more properly called a Paſſion then Faith. 3. Therefore for ought I know, it is no wonder if <hi>Bellarmine</hi> bear the Bell, and Papiſts be unconvinced, if you have no better Arguments then this; eſpecially if no body elſe had better. 4. But yet the Myſterie is far more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable to me, that <hi>faith ſhould be Active in all other, ſave only this Act.</hi> What is this thing called <hi>Faith,</hi> which you make ſuch a <hi>Proteus,</hi> to be <hi>Active</hi> and <hi>Paſsive</hi> as to ſeveral Objects? Yea when it is acknowledged the ſame <hi>Faith,</hi> which receiveth Chriſt and Righteouſneſs, and the ſeveral promiſes, and reſteth on Chriſt for the Pardon of each ſin, for hearing each Prayer, for Aſſurance, Peace, Comfort, Deliverance from temptations, and dangers and ſin, and is thus uſefull through all our lives, for the fetching of help from Chriſt in every ſtreight, yet that this ſame Faith ſhould be <hi>Active</hi> in all the Reſt, and <hi>Paſsive</hi> only in One juſtifying Act. Oh, For the face of an Argument to prove this! Sure its natural Reception of one Object and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is in point of <hi>Paſsiveneſs</hi> alike: and its aſſigned <hi>Conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality</hi> in Scripture, is of like nature as to each branch of the good on that condition promiſed. 5. And here alſo I perceive by your ſpeech you make it conſiſt in ſome ſingle act. And yet you never tell what that is; and how then can it be in ſeveral fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:60968:138"/>
as <hi>Davenant, Ameſius, Joh. Crocius, Melancth.</hi> with moſt do affirm? 6. But yet the depth of the myſterie to me lies in underſtanding and reconciling your words, <hi>[Only in this Act its meerly Recipient.]</hi> Is this an <hi>Act</hi> too? and yet <hi>meerly Recipient?</hi> (which you make a <hi>meer Paſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A meerly Paſsive Act</hi> is ſuch a contradiction <hi>in adjecto</hi> to my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, that I cannot welcome the notion thither; yea if you had ſaid leſs, that it is an <hi>Act in any Part or Degree Paſsive.</hi> I never knew that an Act could <hi>Pati</hi>; yet am I more conſcious of mine own inſufficiency then to contend with one of your knowledge in matter of Philoſophy; but I muſt needs ſay that your notions are yet ſo far beyond my reach, that poſsibly I might take the words as true upon the credit of one whom I ſo highly value, yet am I not able to apprehend the ſence.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The Joy in Heaven</hi> which you mention for a <hi>wandring ſheep,</hi> I think is meant of the firſt, or ſome eminent recovery to Chriſt, and not of every Philoſophical notion: ſure, Sir, if ſalvation hang on this Doctrine, as thus by you explained, I am out of hope that either I or ever a one in all this countrey ſhould ever come to heaven; except by believing as that part of the Church believes which is of your opinion: When I am yet apt to think, that ſiding with any party in ſuch opinions will not conduce to any mans ſalvation: For I am of <hi>Bergius</hi> his mind, that as it is not the Jew, the Pagan, or the Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan, or any Infidel, <hi>(privative,)</hi> that ſhall be ſaved, but the Chriſtian: ſo it is not the <hi>Papiſt, the Lutheran, the Calviniſt, the Arminian, that ſhall be ſaved (qua talis) but the Catholick.</hi> However I am in ſtrong hopes that a man may be ſaved, though he cannot underſtand how an <hi>Act can be a paſſive inſtrument</hi>; nor do I think that my ſubſcribing to that notion, would make any great rejoycing in Heaven.</p>
                        <p>I am ſorry you had not leiſure to anſwer the Queſtions, which were very pertinent to the buſineſs of my ſatisfaction, though not to your buſineſs.</p>
                        <p>That my explication of that plain, weighty, neceſſary point, <hi>how imperfect graces or duties can yet be the conditions of the New Covenant,</hi> ſhould ſeem a Paradox <hi>to you,</hi> I ſay, <hi>to you,</hi> makes me yet more poſſeſt with admiration; When you know that

ſuch conditions there are (ſuppoſe it were but faith alone:) and you know your ſelf that this faith is imperfect. But I perceive we know but in part, and therefore muſt differ in part. He ſhall ſee whom God will enlighten. I had far ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you had fallen upon that point then on the term of <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by works.</hi> If you would but grant me, that <hi>Juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith, as ſuch, is an Accepting of Chriſt for King, and Prophet as well as for a Juſtifier, and conſequently that it is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning our ſelves to be ruled by him, as well as to be ſaved by him,</hi> I ſhall then be content for peace ſake to lay by the phraſe of <hi>Juſtification by work<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I have written thus largely, that I might not be obſcure, and to let you ſee, that though I have ſcarce time to eate or ſleeep, yet I have time and paper for this work, and that I make not light of your diſſent. The Love and Reſpect which you mention to me I do as little doubt of, as I do whether I have a heart in my breaſt: and your deſires of my reducing I know do proceed from your zeal and ſincere affections. That which I take worſt is, that you ſhould ſo deſire me not to take it ill to be called an erring ſhepherd: As if I did not know my Proneneſs to err, and were not conſcious of the weakneſs of my underſtanding: or as if the expreſſions of ſo ſincere love did need excuſe; or as if I were ſo tender and brittle as not to endure ſo gentle a touch: as if my confidence of your love were <hi>Plumea, non Plumbea,</hi> and would be blown away with ſuch a friendly breath! Certainly Sir, your ſharper ſmiting would be precious Balm, ſo it light not on the Truth, but me! I am not ſo unctuous, nitrous, or ſulfureous, as to be kindled with ſuch a gratefull warmth.

My requeſt is, that whereas you intimated in your firſt, a purpoſe of writing ſomewhat againſt me on this ſubject here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, you would be pleaſed to do it in my life time, that I may have the benefit of it, if you do it ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorily; and if not, may have opportunity to acquaint you with the reaſons of my diſſent. <hi>Scribunt Aſinium Pollionem dixiſſe aliquando ſe paraſſe orationes contra Plancum, quas non niſi poſt mortem eſſet editurus; &amp; Plancum reſpondiſſe, cum mortuis non niſi lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vas luctari: ut Lud.

                           <p>Alſo I requeſt that if poſſible you would proceed on ſuch terms as your Divinity may not wholly depend upon meer niceties of Philoſophy: For I cannot think ſuch points to be neer the foundation: Or at leaſt that you will clearly and fully confirm your Philoſophical grounds: For as I find that your Doctrine of a Paſſive Inſtrumentality of the Act of faith (and that in a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

Or whether meer morral reception (by Accepting, Chooſing, Conſenting) as a people receiving the Kings Heires for their future Governours before they are born; or as we receive a man for our King, who dwels far out of our ſight; Or as Princes wives do uſe to take them both for their Husbands and Soveraign Lords, even

in their own Native Countrey, before they come to ſight of the man; the match being both driven on and made, and the marriage or contract performed and imperfectly ſolemnized at that diſtance by an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador or Delegate? juſt ſo do we receive Chriſt, (whoſe humane nature is far off, and his Divine out of our ſight) to be our Saviour, Soveraign (by redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) and Husband; even here in our native Country; the match being moved to us by his Embaſſadors, and imperfectly ſolemnized upon our cordial conſent, and giving up our ſelves to him by our Covenant: (but it ſhall be perfectly ſolemnized at the great Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the Lamb.)

                  <p>For the right underſtanding of what we here maintain, its neceſſary that I explain the Terms, and remove confuſion by ſome neceſſary diſtinctions, and lay down my ſenſe in ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions that make to the opening of this.</p>
                  <p>To trouble you with the Etymologies of the words in ſeveral Languages that ſignifie <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> or <hi>Juſtification</hi> would be a needleſs loſs of time, it being done to our hands by ſo many, and we being ſo far agreed on it, that here lyeth no part of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent controverſie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="260" facs="tcp:60968:144"/>The Form of Righteouſneſs, ſignified by the name is <hi>Relative,</hi> as <hi>ſtrait</hi> or <hi>crooked</hi> is. (For it is not the Habit of Juſtice, by which we give every man his own, that is the Subject of our Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but Righteouſneſs in a Judicial or Legal ſenſe) 1. <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</hi> is either of the <hi>cauſe,</hi> or of the <hi>perſon.</hi> Not that theſe are ſubjects actually <hi>ſeparated</hi> but <hi>diſtinct,</hi> the one being ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to the other. The <hi>cauſe</hi> is the neareſt ſubject, and ſo far as <hi>it is juſt</hi> and <hi>juſtifiable,</hi> ſo far the <hi>perſon</hi> is <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>juſtifiable.</hi> Yet the perſon may <hi>otherwiſe</hi> be juſt and juſtified, when one or many cauſes are unjuſtifyable.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> is denominated either from a Relation to the <hi>Precept</hi> of the Law, or to the <hi>Sanction.</hi> To be <hi>righteous</hi> in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the <hi>Precept,</hi> is to be <hi>conform</hi> to that <hi>Precept</hi>; An <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> or <hi>Diſpoſition</hi> conform to the Precept, is called a Righteous Action or Diſpoſition: and from thence the <hi>perſon</hi> being ſo far conform, is called a <hi>Righteous perſon</hi>: And ſo this <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> as to the <hi>poſitive precept,</hi> is his <hi>obeying it</hi>; and as to the <hi>prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> it is his <hi>Innocency,</hi> contrary to that <hi>guilt,</hi> which we call <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus culpae.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> as a Relation to the <hi>Sanction,</hi> is either a Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the <hi>Commination</hi> and penal Act of the Law, or to the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſory</hi> or Premiant Act. As to the former, <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but the <hi>Not-dueneſs of the puniſhment,</hi> contrary to the <hi>Reatus poenae,</hi> as it reſpects the <hi>execution</hi>; and ſo <hi>A not being ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to condemnation,</hi> as it reſpects the <hi>ſentence.</hi> This is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time founded in the perſons <hi>Innocency</hi> laſt mentioned: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time on a <hi>free pardon</hi> or acquittance: ſometime on <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> made by himſelf: And ſometime on <hi>ſatisfaction by another,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct with free pardon (which is our caſe.)</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> as a Relation to the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> or Premiant part of the Sanction, is nothing but our <hi>Right</hi> to the <hi>Reward, Gift,</hi> or <hi>Benefit,</hi> as <hi>pleadable</hi> and <hi>juſtifyable in foro.</hi> Which ſometime is founded in merit of our own; ſometime in a free Gift: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time in the <hi>merit of another, conjunct with free Gift,</hi> which is our caſe, (other caſes concern us not) This laſt mentioned, is <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</hi> as a Relation to the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of the <hi>Promiſe</hi> or Gift: But when the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> or <hi>Gift,</hi> or <hi>Teſtament,</hi> or Premiant Law is <hi>conditional,</hi> as in our caſe it is, then there is another ſort of
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:60968:144"/>
Righteouſneſs neceſſary, which is Related to the <hi>Modus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſionis,</hi> and that is, <hi>The performance of the condition</hi>: which if it be not properly called Righteouſneſs <hi>Ethically,</hi> yet <hi>civilly</hi> in a <hi>Judiciary</hi> ſenſe it is, when it comes to be the cauſe to be tryed and Judged, whether the perſon have performed the condition, then his cauſe is juſt or unjuſt, and he juſt or unjuſt in that reſpect.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> is either <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal,</hi> as to all cauſes that the perſon can be concerned in: or it is only <hi>particular,</hi> as to ſome cauſes only, and ſo but <hi>ſecundum quid</hi> to the perſon.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. A <hi>particular Righteouſneſs</hi> may either be ſuch as the total welfare of a man depends on; or it may be of leſs and inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable moment.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. When a <hi>cauſe ſubordinate</hi> to the <hi>main cauſe</hi> is <hi>Righteous,</hi> this may be called a <hi>ſubordinate Righteouſneſs.</hi> But if it be <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>main cauſe,</hi> it is a <hi>partial righteouſneſs co-ordinate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I will not trouble you with ſo exact a diſquiſition of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Righteouſneſs and Juſtification as I judge fit in it ſelf, both becauſe I have a little heretofore attempted it, and becauſe I find it blamed as puzling curioſity or needleſs diſtinguiſhing: Though I am not of that mind, yet I have no minde to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome.</p>
                  <p>As for the term <hi>Juſtification,</hi> 1. It either may ſignifie the <hi>Act of the Law or Promiſe:</hi> or the <hi>ſentence of the Judge:</hi> or the <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of that ſentence</hi>; For to one of theſe three ſences the word may ſtill be reduced, as we ſhall have to do with it; that is, to <hi>conſtitutive,</hi> or <hi>ſentential,</hi> or <hi>Executive Juſtification</hi>; though the <hi>ſentence</hi> is moſt properly ſo called. To theſe, <hi>Juſtification</hi> by <hi>Plea, Witneſs,</hi> &amp;c. are <hi>ſubſervient.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Juſtification</hi> is either oppoſed to a <hi>falſe</hi> Accuſation, or to a <hi>true.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. In our caſe, Juſtification is either according to the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>works,</hi> or to the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I think we ſhall at this time have no great need to uſe any more diſtinctions then theſe few, and therefore I will add no more about this Term.</p>
                  <p>As to the term <hi>[Evangelical]</hi> Righteouſneſs may be ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in a four-fold ſenſe. 1. Either becauſe it is that <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
                     <pb n="262" facs="tcp:60968:145"/>
which the <hi>Covenant</hi> or Law of <hi>Grace</hi> requireth as its <hi>Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>; Or 2. Becauſe its a Righteouſneſs <hi>revealed</hi> by the <hi>Gospel</hi>; Or 3.

                  </p>
                  <p>By <hi>[a perſonal]</hi> Righteouſneſs, we mean here, not that which is ours by meer <hi>Imputation,</hi> but that which is founded in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what Inherent in us, or performed by us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>[Neceſſity]</hi> is 1. of a meer <hi>Antecedent.</hi> 2. Or of a <hi>Means</hi>: We mean the laſt. <hi>Means</hi> are either <hi>cauſes,</hi> or <hi>conditions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall now by the help of theſe few diſtinctions give you the plain truth in ſome Propoſitions, both Negatively and Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, as followeth.</p>
                  <p>Propoſition 1. <hi>It is confeſſed by all that know themſelves, or man and the Law, that none of us have a</hi> Perſonal univerſal Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. <hi>For then there were no ſin, nor place for confeſſion, or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, or Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Prop. 2. <hi>And therefore we muſt all confeſs, that in regard of the</hi> Preceptive <hi>part of the</hi> Law of works <hi>we are all</hi> unjuſt, <hi>and cannot be juſtified by the</hi> deeds of the Law, <hi>or by</hi> our works.</p>
                  <p>Prop. 3. <hi>And in regard of the</hi> Commination <hi>of</hi> that Law, <hi>we are all under</hi> guilt <hi>and the</hi> Curſe, <hi>and are the children of wrath, and therefore cannot be juſtified by</hi> that Law, <hi>or by</hi> our works. <hi>Both theſe are proved by</hi> Paul <hi>at large, ſo that none have a perſonal Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Righteouſneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Prop. 4. <hi>No man can plead any</hi> proper ſatisfaction <hi>of his own for the pardon of ſin, and eſcaping the curſe of the Law: But only</hi> Chriſts Satisfaction, <hi>that fulfilled the Law, and became a curſe for us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Prop. 5. <hi>No man can plead any</hi> merit <hi>of his own for procuring the</hi> Reward (<hi>unleſs as actions, that have the promiſe of a Reward, are under Chriſt improperly called</hi> merits) <hi>But our righteouſneſs of this ſort is only the</hi> merit and purchaſe <hi>of Chriſt, and the</hi> free gift <hi>of the Goſpel in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Prop. 6. <hi>We have</hi> no one work <hi>that is</hi> perfectly juſtifiable <hi>by the perfect precepts of the Law of works: And therefore we have no</hi> legal perſonal Righteouſneſs <hi>at all that can properly be ſo called; but are all</hi> corrupt and become abominable, <hi>there being</hi> none that
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:60968:145"/>
doth good, no not one; Imperfect legal righteouſneſs, <hi>is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper ſpeech; it is properly</hi> no <hi>legal righteouſneſs at all, but a leſs degree of unrighteouſneſs (The more to blame they that call ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification ſo)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Prop. 7. <hi>No man can ſay that he is a</hi> Co-ordinate Con-cauſe <hi>with Chriſt in his Juſtification; or that he hath the leaſt degree of a</hi> ſatisfactory <hi>or</hi> Meritorious Righteouſneſs, <hi>which may bear any part in</hi> co-ordination <hi>with Chriſts righteouſneſs, for his juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or ſalvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Prop. 8. <hi>We have not any</hi> perſonal Evangelical Righteouſneſs <hi>of</hi> perfect obedience <hi>to the</hi> Precepts <hi>of Chriſt himſelf: whether it be the Law of Nature as in his hand, or the Gospel poſitives.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Prop. 9. <hi>Even the</hi> Goſpel <hi>perſonal Righteouſneſs of</hi> outward works, <hi>though but in</hi> ſincerity, <hi>and not perfection, is not neceſſary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (no not as an antecedent) to our Juſtification at the firſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Prop. 10. External <hi>works of</hi> Holineſs <hi>are not of abſolute neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to Salvation: for it is poſſible that death may ſuddenly after Converſion, prevent opportunity: and then the inward faith and repentance will ſuffice: Though I think no man can give us one inſtance of ſuch a man</hi> de facto: <hi>not the thief on the croſs: for he confeſſed prayed, reproved the other,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Prop. 11. <hi>Where</hi> ſincere Obedience <hi>is</hi> Neceſſary <hi>to</hi> Salvation, <hi>it is not</hi> all the ſame Acts <hi>of obedience that are of Neceſſity</hi> to all men, <hi>or</hi> at all times: <hi>for the</hi> Matter <hi>may vary, and yet the</hi> ſinece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity <hi>of obedience continue. But</hi> ſome ſpecial <hi>Acts are of</hi> Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>to the</hi> ſincerity.</p>
                  <p>Prop. 12. <hi>If</hi> Righteouſneſs <hi>be denominated from the</hi> Precept, <hi>Chriſts</hi> Obedience <hi>was a perfect legal</hi> Righteouſneſs, <hi>as having a perfect conformity to the Law: But not ſo an</hi> Evangelical Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs: <hi>for he gave us in many Laws for the application of his Merits, that he was neither obliged to fulfill, nor capable of it. If Righteouſneſs be denominated from the</hi> Promiſe <hi>or premiant part of the Law, Chriſts righteouſneſs was in ſome ſort the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of the Law of works, (for he merited all the reward of that Law;) But it was principally the</hi> righteouſneſs <hi>of the</hi> ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Covenant of Redemption <hi>(between the Father and him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) but not of the Covenant of</hi> Grace <hi>made with</hi> man <hi>(he did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent or obey for pardon and ſalvation to himſelf as a Believer;)</hi>
                     <pb n="264" facs="tcp:60968:146"/>
If Righteouſneſs <hi>be denominated from the</hi> Comminatory <hi>or penal part of the Law then Chriſts</hi> ſufferings <hi>were neither a</hi> ſtrictly legal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>or an</hi> Evangelical righteouſneſs. <hi>For the Law required the</hi> ſupplicium ipſius delinquentis, <hi>and knew no Surety or Subſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute. But</hi> thus <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſufferings <hi>were a</hi> Pro-Legal-righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>as being not the</hi> fulfilling <hi>of the</hi> Threatening, <hi>but a</hi> full Satisfaction <hi>to the</hi> Law-giver, <hi>(which was equivalent) and ſo a valuable conſideration, why the Law ſhould</hi> not be fulfilled <hi>(by our damnation) but</hi> diſpenſed with <hi>(by our pardon) So that the Commination was the cauſe of Chriſts ſufferings; and he ſuffered materially the ſame ſort of Death which the Law threatened. But moſt ſtrictly his ſufferings were a</hi> Righteous fulfilling his part of the Covenant of Redemption with the Father: <hi>But in no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety were they the fulfilling of the</hi> Commination <hi>of the</hi> Law of Grace, <hi>againſt the Deſpiſers or neglecters of Grace. I mean that proper to the Gospel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Prop. 13. <hi>Chriſts righteouſneſs is well called our</hi> Evangelical Righteouſneſs, <hi>both as it is</hi> Revealed <hi>by the</hi> Goſpel, <hi>and</hi> confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>by it, and oppoſed to the legal way of Juſtification by perfect per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Righteouſneſs. So that by calling our own perſonal righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> Evangelical, <hi>we deny not that Title to Chriſts, but give it</hi> that in <hi>a higher reſpect, and much more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Prop. 14. <hi>No perſonal righteouſneſs of ours, our faith or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, is any</hi> proper cauſe <hi>of our</hi> firſt <hi>Juſtification, or of our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into a juſtifyed ſtate: Though as they remove Impediments, or are Conditions, they may</hi> improperly <hi>be called cauſes; So much for the</hi> Negative <hi>Propoſitions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Affirm. Prop. 1. <hi>That a Godly man hath a</hi> particular righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, <hi>or may be</hi> Juſt in a particular cauſe, <hi>there is no man can deny: unleſs he will make him worſe then the Devil: for if the Devil may be falſly accuſed or belyed, he is juſt in that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar cauſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Prop. 2. <hi>All Chriſtians that I know do confeſs an</hi> Inherent Righteouſneſs <hi>in the Saints, and the neceſſity of this righteouſneſs to Salvation. So that this can be no part of our Controverſie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Prop. 3. <hi>Conſequently all muſt confeſs that Chriſts righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs imputed, is not our</hi> only <hi>righteouſneſs. Yea, that the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:60968:146"/>
of Pardon and Juſtification from ſin, is no further neceſſary then men are ſinners; and therefore the leſs need any man hath of it, the better he pleaſeth Chriſt, that is, he had rather we would beware of ſin as far as may be, then ſin and fly to him for Pardon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Prop. 4. <hi>And we are agreed I think that the</hi> perſonal Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs <hi>of the Saints is ſo much the end of Chriſts Redemption and Pardoning Grace, that the</hi> perfection <hi>of this is that</hi> bleſſed ſtate <hi>to which he will bring them; ſo that when he hath done his work,</hi> Sanctification <hi>ſhall be perfect; but</hi> Juſtification <hi>by</hi> Pardon <hi>of further ſins, ſhall</hi> be no more: <hi>Heaven cannot bear ſo imperfect a ſtate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Prop. 5. <hi>We are agreed therefore that our</hi> Righteouſneſs of Sanctification, <hi>or the Doctrine thereof is ſo far from being any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation or diſhonour to Chriſt, that it is the high honour which he intended in his work of Redemption, that the Glory of God the Father, and of the Redeemer may everlaſtingly ſhine forth in the Saints, and they may be fit to love, and ſerve, and praiſe him,</hi> Tit. 2.14.</p>
                  <p>Prop. 6. <hi>It is paſt all doubt that this</hi> Inherent Righteouſneſs <hi>conſiſteth in a</hi> true fulfilling of the Conditions of the Goſpel-Promiſe, <hi>and a</hi> ſincere Obedience to the Precepts of <hi>Chriſt. And ſo hath a double reſpect</hi>: one <hi>to the Promiſe; and ſo it is</hi> conditio praeſtita: <hi>the other to the</hi> Precept; <hi>and ſo it is</hi> Officium praeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum. <hi>All</hi> Conditions <hi>here are</hi> Duties: <hi>but all</hi> Duties are not the <hi>Condition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Prop. 7. <hi>I think we are agreed, that</hi> Juſtification by Chriſt as Judge <hi>at the great day, hath the very ſame</hi> Conditions <hi>as</hi> Salvation <hi>hath, it being an</hi> adjudging us to Salvation. <hi>And therefore that this perſonal</hi> Evangelical Righteouſneſs <hi>is of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to our</hi> Juſtification <hi>at</hi> that Judgement.</p>
                  <p>Prop. 8. <hi>And I think we are agreed that no man can</hi> continue <hi>in a</hi> ſtate <hi>of Juſtification, that</hi> continueth <hi>not in a</hi> ſtate <hi>of</hi> Faith, <hi>Sanctification, ond ſincere Obedience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Prop. 9 <hi>We are agreed I am ſure that no man at age is juſtified before he Repent and Believe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Prop. 10 <hi>And we are agreed that this Repenting and Believing is both the matter of the</hi> Goſpel-Precept, <hi>and the</hi> Condition <hi>of
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:60968:147"/>
the</hi> Promiſe. <hi>Chriſt hath made over to us himſelf with his imputed Righteouſneſs and Kingdom, on condition that we repent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Prop. 11. <hi>It cannot then be denied that Faith and Repentance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both the</hi> Duty commanded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>and the</hi> Condition required <hi>and</hi> performed, <hi>are truly a</hi> particular ſpecial Righteouſneſs, ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs, in order to our further participation of him, and from him.</p>
                  <p>Prop. 12. <hi>And laſtly its paſt diſpute that this</hi> perſonal Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Faith and Repentance, <hi>is not to be called a</hi> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, <hi>but an</hi> Evangelical Righteouſneſs, <hi>becauſe it is the</hi> Goſpel <hi>that both</hi> commandeth <hi>them, and</hi> promiſeth <hi>life to thoſe that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus methinks all that I deſire is granted already: what Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary could a man dream of among Proteſtants in ſuch a Cauſe? Agreement ſeemeth to prevent the neceſſity of a further Diſpute.</p>
                  <p>To be yet briefer, and bring it nearer an Iſſue: If any thing of the main <hi>Theſis</hi> here be denyed, it muſt be one of theſe three things. 1. That there is <hi>any ſuch thing</hi> as Faith, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance or Sanctification. 2. Or that they ſhould be <hi>called an Evangelical perſonal Righteouſneſs.</hi> 3. Or that they are <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to Juſtification and Salvtaion</hi>: The firſt is <hi>de exiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia rei</hi>: The ſecond is <hi>de nomine</hi>: The third is <hi>de uſu &amp; fine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt no man but a Heathen or Infidel will deny.</p>
                  <p>And for the ſecond, that this name is fit for it, I prove by parts. 1. It may and muſt be called <hi>A Righteouſneſs.</hi> 2. <hi>A Perſonal Righteouſneſs.</hi> 3. <hi>An Evangelical Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. As <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> ſignifieth the <hi>Habit</hi> by which we give to all their own, ſo this is <hi>Righteouſneſs.</hi> For in Regeneration the ſoul is habituated to give up it ſelf to God as his own, and to give up all we have to him, and to love and ſerve all where his love and ſervice doth require it. No true habit is ſo excellent as that which is given in Regeneration.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>ſincere</hi> performance of the <hi>Duties</hi> required of us by
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:60968:147"/>
the Evangelical <hi>Precept,</hi> is a <hi>ſincere Evangelical Righteouſneſs</hi>: But our firſt turning to God in Chriſt by Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, is the ſincere performance of the duties required of us by the Evangelical Precept. <hi>Ergo.</hi> — Object. <hi>The Goſpel requireth actual external Obedience and perſeverance alſo.

                  <p n="3">3. The true Performance of the Conditions of Juſtification and Salvation, impoſed in the Goſpel-Promiſe, is a true <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Righteouſneſs</hi>: But Faith and Repentance at the <hi>firſt,</hi> and ſincere Obedience added afterward, are the true performance of theſe Conditions. <hi>Ergo.</hi>—</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is commonly called by the name of <hi>Inherent Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> by all Divines with one Conſent: therefore the name of <hi>[Righteouſneſs]</hi> is paſt controverſie here.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That which in Judgement muſt be his <hi>juſtitia cauſae,</hi> the Righteouſneſs of his cauſe, is ſo far the <hi>Righteouſneſs of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>: (for the perſon muſt needs be righteous <hi>quoad hanc cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam,</hi> as to that cauſe) But our Faith and Repentance will be much of the Righteouſneſs of our cauſe at that day (for the Tryal of us will be, whether we are true Believers, and penitent or not; and that being much of the cauſe of the day, we muſt needs be righteous or unrighteous as to that cauſe:) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Faith and Repentance is much of the Righteouſneſs of our perſons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> denominated in reſpect to the Tryal and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that day.</p>
                  <p n="6">6.

Gen. 15.6. <hi>And he believed in the Lord, and he counted it to him for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</hi> Pſal. 106.31. Rom. 43.5. <hi>His faith is counted for righteouſneſs.</hi> ver. 9. <hi>Faith was reckoned to</hi> Abraham <hi>for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</hi> ver 22, 24. <hi>Therefore it was imputed to him for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs. Now it was not written for his ſake alone, that it was imputed to him, but for us alſo to whom it ſhall be imputed, if we believe on him that raiſed up Jeſus our Lord from the dead. So</hi> Jam. 2.23. Gal. 3.6. <hi>If any ſay that by [Faith]</hi> in all theſe Texts is meant <hi>Chriſts righteouſneſs,</hi> and not <hi>Faith,</hi> I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive them when I take Scripture to be intelligible only by them, and that God did not write it to have it underſtood. But that Faith is imputed or accounted to us for Righteouſneſs in a ſenſe meerly ſubordinate to Chriſts righteouſneſs, by which we are juſtified, I eaſily grant. As to <hi>Satisfaction</hi> and <hi>Merit</hi> we have no righteouſneſs but Chriſts, but a Covenant and Law we are ſtill under, and not redeemed to be lawleſs: and this Covenant is ordained as the way of making over Chriſt and his meritorious righteouſneſs, and life to us: and therefore they being given or made over on Covenant-terms, there is a perſonal performance of the conditions neceſſary: and ſo that perſonal performance is all the righteouſneſs inherent or <hi>propiae actionis,</hi> that God requireth of us now, whereas by the firſt Covenant perfect Obedience was required as neceſſary to life. So that in point of meer perſonal performance our own Faith is accepted, and imputed or accounted to us for Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, that is, <hi>God will require no more as neceſſary to Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation at our own hands,</hi> but that we believe in the righteouſneſs of another, and accept a Redeemer (though once he required more:) But as to the <hi>ſatiſfying</hi> of the Juſtice of the offended Majeſty, and the meriting of life with pardon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is our only <hi>Righteouſneſs.</hi> But nothing in Scripture is more plain then that Faith it ſelf is ſaid to be <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:60968:148"/>
to us for Righteouſneſs</hi>; and not only <hi>Chriſts own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs:</hi> He that will not take this for proof, muſt expect no Scripture proof of any thing from me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.24. <hi>The new man after God is created in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> Many other Texts do call our firſt Converſion, or ſtate of Grace, our faith and repentance, and our ſincere obedience by the name of <hi>Righteouſneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. And then that it may, and that moſt fitly be called an <hi>Evangelical</hi> righteouſneſs, I will not trouble the Reader to prove, leſt I ſeem to cenſure his underſtanding as too ſtupid. Its eaſie to try whether our Faith and Repentance, our Inherent Righteouſneſs, do more anſwer the Precepts and Promiſe of Chriſt in the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> or thoſe of the <hi>Law of works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. And that this is a perſonal righteouſneſs, I have leſs need to prove: Though it is Chriſt that <hi>purchaſed</hi> it (and ſo it may be called the <hi>righteouſneſs of Chriſt</hi>) and the Spirit that <hi>work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> it in us, yet its we that are the <hi>Subjects</hi> and the <hi>Agents</hi> as to the act.</p>
                  <p>It being therefore paſt doubt that, 1. The <hi>thing it ſelf is exiſtent and neceſſary.</hi> 2. <hi>That righteouſneſs is a fit name for it.</hi> 3. All that remains to be proved is the Uſe of it, <hi>Whether it be neceſſary to Juſtification and Salvation.</hi> And here the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon agreement of Divines, (except the <hi>Antinomians</hi>) doth ſave us the labour of proving this: for they all agree that <hi>Faith and Repentance</hi> are neceſſary to our firſt Juſtification; and that ſincere obedience alſo is neceſſary to our Juſtification at Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to our Salvation. So that here being no conteoverſie, I will not make my ſelf needleſs work.</p>
                  <p>Obejct. 1. <hi>But faith and repentance are not neceſſary to Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> qua juſtitia quaedam Evangelica, <hi>under the notion of a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, but faith as an Inſtrument, and repentance as a qualifying condition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. We are not now upon the queſtion under what notion theſe are neceſſary. It ſufficeth to the proof of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Theſis,</hi> that a perſonal Evangelical Righteouſneſs is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, whether <hi>quâ talis</hi> or not.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="270" facs="tcp:60968:149"/>2. But the plain truth is, 1. Remotely, in reſpect of its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Aptitude to its office, faith is neceſſary becauſe it is a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Act,</hi> and therefore fitted to a <hi>free Gift,</hi> and an <hi>Aſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Act, and therefore fitted to a <hi>ſupernatural Revelation</hi>: And hence Divines ſay, <hi>It juſtifieth as an Inſtrument,</hi> calling its <hi>Receptive nature,</hi> Metaphorically an <hi>Inſtrument</hi>: which in this ſenſe is true. And Repentance is neceſſary, becauſe it is that Return to God, and recovery of the ſoul which is the end of Redemption, without which the following ends cannot be attained. The <hi>Receptive nature</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> and the <hi>diſpoſitive uſe</hi> of <hi>Repentance,</hi> may be aſſigned as Reaſons, <hi>Why God made them conditions of the Promiſe</hi>: as being their aptitude thereto. 2. But the <hi>neareſt reaſon</hi> of their <hi>Intereſt</hi> and <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by the free conſtitution of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they are made condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in that Promiſe that conferreth Juſtification and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, determining that without theſe they ſhall not be had, and that whoever believeth ſhall not periſh, and if we repent, our ſins ſhall be forgiven us. So that this is the formal or neareſt Reaſon of their neceſſity and intereſt, that they are the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the Covenant, ſo made by the free Donor, Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſer, Teſtator. Now this which in the <hi>firſt inſtant</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration is a condition, is in the <hi>next inſtant</hi> or conſideration, a <hi>true Evangelical Righteouſneſs,</hi> as that <hi>Condition</hi> is a <hi>Duty</hi> in reſpect to the <hi>Precept</hi>; and as it is our Title to the benefit of the Promiſe, and ſo is the Covenant-performance, and as it hath reſpect to the ſentence of Judgement, where this will be the cauſe of the day, <hi>Whether this Condition was performed or not.</hi> It is not the <hi>Condition as impoſed,</hi> but as <hi>performed,</hi> on which we become juſtified: And therefore as <hi>ſentential Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> is paſt upon the proof of this perſonal Righteouſneſs, which is our performance of the condition, on which we have Title to Chriſt and Pardon, and eternal life; even ſo our Juſtification <hi>in the ſenſe of the Law or Covenant,</hi> is on ſuppoſition of this ſame performance of the Condition, as ſuch: which is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Righteouſneſs. If at the laſt Judgement we are <hi>ſententially juſtified</hi> by it as it is <hi>quaedam juſtitia,</hi> a Righteouſneſs ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to Chriſts Righteouſneſs, (which is certain,) then in <hi>Law-ſenſe</hi> we are <hi>juſtifiable</hi> by it on the ſame account. For to
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:60968:149"/>
be <hi>juſtified</hi> in <hi>point of law,</hi> is nothing elſe then to be <hi>juſtifiable,</hi> or <hi>juſtificandus,</hi> by <hi>ſentence</hi> and <hi>execution</hi> according to that Law: ſo that its clear that a <hi>perſonal Righteouſneſs, qua talis,</hi> is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to <hi>Justification,</hi> and not only <hi>quo talis</hi>; though this be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond our Queſt on in hand, and therefore I add it but for <hi>eluci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> and <hi>ex abundanti.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Object. 2. <hi>If this be ſo, then men are righteous before God doth juſtifie them.</hi>
                  </p>

This <hi>particular Righteouſneſs</hi> is but the means to poſſeſs them of Chriſts Righteouſneſs, by which they are mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially and fully juſtified. 4. There is not a moments diſtance of time between them: For as ſoon as we believe and repent we are made partakers of Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs, by a meer reſultancy from the Promiſe of the Goſpel. 5. Who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeth that we have Faith and Repentance before Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
                  <p>Object. 3. <hi>But according to this Doctrine we are juſtified before we are juſtified: For he that is Righteous is conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted juſt, and ſo is juſtifiable in Judgement, which is to be juſtified in Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Very true: But we are as is ſaid, made juſt or juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied but with a <hi>particular,</hi> and not an <hi>univerſal Righteouſneſs</hi>; which will not donominate the perſon ſimply a Righteous or juſtified perſon: we are ſo far cured of our former Infidelity and Impenitency, that we are true penitent Believers before our ſins are pardoned by the Promiſe: and ſo we are in order of nature (not of time) firſt juſtifiable againſt the falſe <hi>Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,</hi> that <hi>we are impenitent <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers,</hi> before we are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable againſt the <hi>true accuſation</hi> of all <hi>our ſins, and deſert of Hell.</hi> He that by inherent Faith and Repentance is not firſt juſtifiable againſt the former falſe charge, cannot by the blood
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:60968:150"/>
and merits of Chriſt be juſtifiable againſt the latter true accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For Chriſt and Pardon are given by the Covenant of Grace, to none but penitent Believers.</p>
                  <p>Object. 4. <hi>By this you confound Juſtification and Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for inherent Righteouſneſs belongs not to Juſtification, but to Sanctification.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Your Affirmation is no proof, and my diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them is not confounding them.

                  <p>Object. 5. <hi>By this means you make Sanctification to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Juſtification, as a Condition or means to it: when Divines com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly put it after.</hi>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Mr. <hi>Pemble,</hi> and thoſe that follow him, put Sanctification before all true Juſtification, (though they call Gods immanent eternal Act, a precedent Juſtification.) 2. The caſe is eaſie, if you will not confound the verbal part of the controverſie with the Real. What is it that you call <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification?</hi> 1. If it be the firſt ſpecial Grace in Act or Habit, ſo you will confeſs, that <hi>Sanctification</hi> goeth firſt: For we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and believe before we are pardoned or juſtified. 2. If it be any further <hi>degrees</hi> or fruits, or exerciſe of Grace, then we are agreed that <hi>Juſtification</hi> goeth before it. 3. If it be both <hi>begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>progreſs, faith</hi> and <hi>obedience</hi> that you call <hi>Sanctification,</hi> then part of it is <hi>before</hi> Juſtification, and part <hi>after.</hi> All this is plain; and that which I think we are agreed in.</p>
                  <p>But here I am invited to a conſideration of ſome Arguments of a new Opponent, Mr. <hi>Warner</hi> in a book of the <hi>Object and Office of Faith.</hi> What he thought it his Duty to oppoſe, I take it

                     <p>Reader, I crave thy pardon for troubling thee with the Confutation of ſuch Impertinencies, that are called <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations</hi>: It is I that have the bigger part of the trouble: But how ſhould I avoid it without wrong to the Truth? See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (would you think it!) there are ſome Readers that cannot diſcern the vanity of ſuch Arguings without Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. What a groſs abuſe is this to begin with, to conclude that theſe two ſorts of Righteouſneſs are not neceſſary <hi>[to make up]</hi> our <hi>Juſtification,</hi> when the Queſtion was only whether they are neceſſary <hi>[to]</hi> our <hi>Juſtification. [Making up]</hi> expreſſeth the proper cauſality of the conſtitutive cauſes, (matter and form,) and not of the efficient or final; much leſs the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of all other means, ſuch as a condition is. So that I grant him his concluſion, taking Juſtification as we now do Our Faith or Repentance goeth not to make it up.</p>
                     <p>And yet on the by, I ſhall add, that if any man will needs take Juſtification for Sanctification, or as the Papiſts do <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſively</hi> for Sanctification and Pardon both (as ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:60968:151"/>
Divines think it is uſed in ſome few Texts) in that large ſenſe our Faith and Repentance are part of our juſtifying Righteouſneſs. But I do not ſo uſe the word, (Though <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip Codurcus</hi> have writ at large for it.)</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I deny his Conſequence: And how is it proved? By reciting <hi>Pauls</hi> words, <hi>Rom.</hi> 116. Which contain not any of the terms in the queſtion. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of Election: we of Juſtification (though that difference I regard not.) <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>works,</hi> and we ſpeak of Evangelical Faith and Repentance. In a word there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I anſwer. The works that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of are inconſiſtent with Grace in Juſtification (though not contradictory, but contrary, what ever Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſay:) but Faith and Repentance are not thoſe works; and therefore no contrariety is hence proved. Here is nothing therefore but a raſh Aſſertion of Mr. <hi>W.</hi> to prove theſe two ſorts of Righteouſneſs contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory.</p>
                     <p>Be judge all Divines and Chriſtians upon earth: Did you ever hear before from a Divine or Chriſtian, that imputed and inherent Righteouſneſs, or Juſtification and Sanctification, or Chriſts fulfilling the Law for us, and our believing the Goſpel and repenting were contradictory in themſelves? Do not all that believe the Scripture, believe that we have a perſonal Righteouſneſs, a true Faith and Repentance, and muſt ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the Conditions of the Promiſe; and that in reſpect to theſe the Scripture calls us Righteous? (as is before proved.)</p>

                        <hi>If the perſon juſtified is of himſelf ungodly, then Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal and Evangelical Righteouſneſs are not both abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to our Juſtification: But the perſon juſtified (conſidering him in the act of juſtifying) is ſo, therefore.—The Sequel is undeny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; becauſe he who is ungodly is not Legally Righteous, and that the perſon now to be juſtified is ungodly, is expreſs Scripture,</hi> Rom. 4.5. <hi>But to him that worketh not, but believeth in him that juſt fieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteouſneſs.</hi>

Merits and Satisfaction made over to us, for the effects; and that the perſonal Evangelical Righteouſneſs is our believing and repenting. Now that theſe are both neceſſary, this very Text proveth, which he citeth againſt it. For the neceſſity of Chriſts meritorious Righteouſneſs he will not deny that it is here imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and the neceſſity of our own faith is twice expreſt, <hi>[To him that believeth, his faith is counted for righteouſneſs.]</hi> If it be the <hi>Being</hi> of Faith that this Brother would exclude it is here twice expreſt: If it be only the naming it <hi>[a righteouſneſs]</hi> That name alſo is here expreſt.

But if by <hi>[<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly]</hi> be meant [<hi>Sinners,</hi> or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons unjuſtifyable by the works of the Law, who are legally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious] then I deny the conſequence of the <hi>Major.</hi> Do I need to tell a Divine that a man may be a ſinner and a penitent Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever at once. The <hi>Syriack</hi> and <hi>Ethiopick</hi> tranſlating the word <hi>[ſinners]</hi> do thus expound the Text; and its the common Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of moſt judicious Divines. It is not of the Apoſtles meaning to tell you that God juſtifieth impenitent Infidels, or haters of God: but that he juſtifieth ſinners, legally condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and unworthy, yet true Believers, as the Text expreſſeth.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If any reject this Expoſition, and will take <hi>[ungodly]</hi> here for <hi>[the Impenitent,]</hi> then the other Expoſition ſolveth his Objection, <hi>viz.</hi> They were Impenitent and Unbelievers, in the inſtant next foregoing, but not in the inſtant of Juſtification: For faith and Juſtification are in the ſame inſtant of time.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Rather then believe that God juſtifieth Infidels contrary to the text, I would interpret this Text as <hi>Beza</hi> doth ſome other, as ſpeaking of Juſtification as comprehending both Converſion and Forgiveneſs, even the conferring of Inherent and Imput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Righteouſneſs both: and ſo God juſtifieth Infidels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; that is, giveth them firſt faith and Repentance, and then forgiveneſs and eternal life in Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. But I wonder at his proof of his Sequel <hi>[Becauſe he

Apoſtolical writings are utterly againſt a two-fold Righteouſneſs in this work; therefore to aſſert both theſe kinds is to overthrow their writings. For to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe did</hi> Paul <hi>diſpute againſt Juſtification by works of the Law, if the righteouſneſs of Faith were not ſufficient?

                     <p>Either this Writer owns the two-fold Righteouſneſs that he diſputeth againſt, or not: If he did not, he were an Infidel or wretched Heretick, directly denying Chriſt or Faith; For Chriſt is the one Righteouſneſs, and faith the other. If he do own them (as I doubt not at all but he doth) is it not good ſervice to the Church to pour out this oppoſition againſt words not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and to make men believe that the difference is ſo mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial as to overthrow the Scriptures? But to his Argument, I deny the conſequence of the <hi>Major</hi>; and how is it proved? for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth <hi>by a Dilemma</hi> (which other folks call an Enthymeme) Of which the Antecedent <hi>(That Apoſtolical writings are againſt a two-fold righteouſneſs)</hi> is proved by this Writers word. A learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed proof I into which this Diſputations are ultimately reſolved. It is the very work of <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles to prove the neceſſity of this Two-fold Righteouſneſs (unleſs you will with the Papiſts call it rather two parts of one Righteouſneſs,) Chriſts merits and mans faith, one in our ſurety, the other wrought by him in our ſelves.</p>

                        <pb n="277" facs="tcp:60968:152"/>But, ſaith he, to what purpoſe did <hi>Paul</hi> diſpute againſt Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by the works of the Law, If the Righteouſneſs of faith were not ſufficient? —I anſwer you, 1. Becauſe no man hath a perſonal legal Righteouſneſs: But <hi>Paul</hi> never diſputed againſt a legal Righteouſneſs in Chriſt, or his fulfilling the Law, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made a curſe for us. Do you think he did? 2. A Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of faith is ſufficient: for it ſignifieth this two-fold righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs. 1. That righteouſneſs which faith accepteth, which is <hi>[of Faith]</hi> becauſe proclaimed in the Goſpel and is the <hi>object</hi> of Faith; and yet it is legal, in that it was a Conformity to the Law, and ſatisfaction to the Law-giver. 2. <hi>Faith it ſelf,</hi> which is a particular ſubſervient Evangelical Rigeteouſneſs, for the application and poſſeſſion of the former.</p>
                     <p>And now was here a fit occaſion to ſpeak reproach fully of <hi>Paul,</hi> as extream ignorant, or unfaithful, or <hi>immanis ſophiſta</hi>? and all becauſe he would not deny either Chriſt or Faith?

                        <hi>If both Legal and Evangelical righteouſneſs were thus required to the purpoſe of juſtifying, then it muſt be becauſe the Evangelical is of it ſelf inſufficient.

                     <p>By this time I am tempted to repent that I medled with this Brother. If he live to read over a reply or two, he may poſſibly underſtand them that he writes againſt. He will prove that a <hi>Legal</hi> Righteouſneſs is not neceſſary, becauſe Chriſts righteouſneſs (which is it that I called legal) is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient. Its ſufficient alone: therefore not <hi>Neceſſary.</hi> Am not I like to have a fair hand think you of this Diſputer? To his Argument once more I diſtinguiſh: Evangelical righteouſneſs it twofold. 1. That which the Goſpel revealeth and offereth: and this is Chriſts righteouſneſs, therefore called Evangelical: but alſo Legal, becauſe it anſwered the rule of the Law of works, and its ends. 2. That which the Goſpel hath made the
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:60968:153"/>
Condition of our part in Chriſt and his righteouſneſs: and this is Faith it ſelf. Both theſe are ſufficient to Juſtification: but Faith is neither <hi>ſufficient,</hi> nor is <hi>Faith</hi> without Chriſts legal righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs: And Chriſt is ſufficient <hi>Hypothetically,</hi> but will not be <hi>effectual</hi> to our Juſtification without Faith (and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.)</p>
                     <p>But perhaps this Writer means only to ſhew his offence againſt my naming Chriſts righteouſneſs legal. If that be ſo, 1. I have given in my reaſons, becauſe there can be no better reaſon of a name then from the form: and the form of Chriſts righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs being relative, even a conformity to the Law of works (and to the peculiar Covenant of redemption,) I thought did ſufficiently warrant this name. 2. The rather when I find not only that he is ſaid to fulfill the Law and all righteouſneſs, and be made a curſe for us, but alſo to be righteous with that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, which is denyed of us; which can be none but a legal or prolegal righteouſneſs. 3. But yet if the name <hi>[Legal]</hi> be all, I could eaſily have given this Brother leave to differ from me about a name without contention, and methinks he might have done the like by me.</p>

                     <p>Your <hi>Minor</hi> is falſe, and your proof is no proof, but your word. Your ſimilitude ſhould have run thus. If an Act of Oblivion by the Princes purchaſe, do pardon all that will thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully accept it and come in and lay down arms of Rebellion; it is no derogating from the Prince or pardon to ſay, I accept it, I ſtand out no longer, and therefore it is mine. If you offer to heal a deadly ſore on condition you be accepted for the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion; doth it derogate from your honour if your Patient ſay, I do conſent and take you for my Chyrurgion, and will take your Medicines?</p>
                     <p>Your proof is as vain and null, that it derogates from faith. What, that Faith ſhould be this ſubſervient Righteouſneſs? Doth that diſhonour it? Or is it that Repentance is conjoyned as to our firſt Juſtification, and obedience as to that at Judgement? When you prove either of theſe diſhonourable to faith, we will believe you: but it muſt be a proof that is ſtronger then the Goſpel that is againſt you. We confeſs faith to be the <hi>receiving Condition,</hi> and repentance but the <hi>diſpoſing Condition</hi>: but both are <hi>Conditions.</hi> As for <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. Do you not ſee that it is againſt you? I profeſs with <hi>Paul,</hi> not to have <hi>a righteouſneſs of my own which is of the Law,</hi> (which made me loth to call faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance a legal righteouſneſs) but <hi>that which is through the faith of Chriſt, the righteouſneſs which is of God by faith</hi>:] Faith you ſee is the means of our Title to Chriſts Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: And if you deny faith it ſelf to be any particular Righteouſneſs, you muſt make it a ſin, or indifferent, and contradict the Scriptures. And preſently contradicting what you have been arguing for (that Evangelical Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is not in us, and we are not the Subjects of it:) You profeſs <hi>pag.</hi> 178. That Inherent <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> is in us.
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:60968:156"/>
It ſeems then either Inherent <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> is not <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> or it is not <hi>Evangelical</hi> but <hi>Legal,</hi> or it is in us, and not in us.</p>
                     <p>Had you only pleaded that we are not juſtified by it as a Righteouſneſs, I ſhould have anſwered you as before on that point. Not as a Legal Righteouſneſs; nor an Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Righteouſneſs co-ordinate with Chriſts; but as a fulfilling of the Condition of that Promiſe, which gives us Chriſt, and Pardon, and Life; by which performance of the Condition, the Benefit becomes ours by the Will and Grant of the free Donor; and we are no longer impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent Infidels, but juſt, and juſtifiable from the falſe charge of being ſuch; and ſo of not having part in Chriſt. Its one thing to be accuſed of ſin as ſin: And another thing to be accuſed of the ſpecial ſin of not accepting the Remedy: and ſo of having no part in Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs. From the later we muſt have a real Faith and Title to Chriſt, which muſt materially juſtifie us: but from the former, even from all ſin that ever we are guilty of Chriſts Righteouſneſs only juſtifieth us materially and meritoriouſly, and our faith is but a bare condition.</p>

                  <head>A Confutation of the Error of Mr. <hi>Warners 13th</hi> Chapter about Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and the intereſt of Obedience therein.</head>
                  <p>HE begins with a falſe Intimation, that we revive the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts firſt and ſecond Juſtification: and he that will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him, may take his courſe for me: I crave only liberty for my ſelf to believe that it is not all one to have Juſtification be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun and continued; and that Juſtification by the ſentence of the Judge, is not of the ſame kind with Juſtification Legal by the Donation of the Goſpel. If I may not have this Reverend Brothers leave to believe theſe matters, I will believe them without his leave. And that the Papiſts have ſuch friends among us, as thoſe that make the world believe that ſuch things as theſe are Popery, I will alſo lament, though ſuch Diſputers give not their conſent.</p>
                  <p>His Endeavours to overthrow that Doctrine of mine which he nameth of <hi>[ſecond Juſtification]</hi> begin <hi>pag.</hi> 223. where he argueth, 1. from <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2, 3. <hi>That the beginning and end is aſcribed to faith.</hi> Anſwer. Its all granted: faith is it that we are juſtified by to the laſt. We are agreed of this incluſively: But the Queſtion is, whats the Excluſion: Not <hi>believing in Chriſt as Lord and Maſter, nor loving him</hi>; but the works that make or are ſuppoſed to make that Reward to be of debt, and not of Grace.</p>
                  <p>His ſecond proof is from <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.7, 8. To which I anſwer. We are of <hi>Pauls</hi> mind, but not of yours. 1. He counted all
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:60968:157"/>
as loſs and dung that ſtood in oppoſition to, or competition with Chriſt: and ſo would I do by faith and love it ſelf, ſhould they be ſo arrogant. 2. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſly nameth the works that he excludeth, that is, the <hi>Righteouſneſs which is of the Law,</hi> or in <hi>Legal works.</hi> And do we make any doubt of this? No, nor of thoſe works that materially are Evangelical: for if they are formally Evangelical they cannot be ſet up againſt Chriſt, their very nature being to ſubſerve him.</p>
                  <p>Once for all, remember this Argument. Thoſe works that are commanded by God in the Goſpel, are not excluded by God in the Goſpel in that nature and to the uſe for which they are commanded. But faith in Chriſt Jeſus the Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, (an entire faith) and Repentance towards God and love to him are commanded by God in the Goſpel in order to the pardon of ſin; and the continuance of theſe with ſincere Obedience, are commanded as <hi>means</hi> of our continued par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and as a means of our final Juſtification at Judgement. Therefore none of theſe are excluded by the Goſpel from any of theſe uſes or ends.</p>
                  <p>He citeth alſo, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.17. to as much purpoſe as the reſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 228. He begins his Arguments. The firſt is <hi>[Becauſe in vain are additions of numbers, without which any thing may be done: But without addition of works the act of juſtifying is perfect, Ergo.]</hi> Anſwer. 1. As if the Queſtion were of the <hi>[Act of juſtifying,]</hi> and not of Juſtification paſſively taken. Gods act hath no imperfection, when yet it maketh not a perfect work. 2. Its but ſpleen and partiality to harp upon the term <hi>[works]</hi> ſtill to ſeduce your Readers to believe that I am for ſuch works as <hi>Paul</hi> denyeth. I uſe not the phraſe of <hi>[Juſtification by works]</hi> nor think it fit to be uſed, unleſs rarely, or to explain ſuch texts of Scripture as do uſe it, or terms equipollent. 3. Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is neither perfect nor real, without a faith in Chriſt as Head and Husband, and Lord, and Teacher, and Interceſſor, as well as a Sacrifice for ſin. Nor is it perfect or true, without repenting and loving Chriſt. 4. Juſtification is ſo far perfect at firſt, as that no ſin paſt or exiſtent is unpardoned. But it is not ſo perfect, but that, 1. Many future ſins muſt have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:60968:158"/>
pardon. 2. And means is to be uſed by us, (believing again at leaſt) for that end. 3. And the continuance of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don is given us but conditionally, (though we ſhall certainly perform the condition.) 4. And the moſt perfect ſort of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification (by ſentence at Judgement) is ſtill behind. Are theſe things doubtfull among Divines or Chriſtians? That the Church muſt be thus moleſted by ſuch diſputing volumes againſt it, to make the Papiſts and other enemies believe we hold I know not what? Read the many Arguments of learned <hi>Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> and <hi>Parker de Deſcenſu,</hi> and Bp. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher de Deſcenſu</hi> (to the <hi>Jeſuite</hi>) by which they prove that all ſeparated ſouls, as ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, are under penalty, and that Chriſts ſoul as ſeperated was ſo: and then tell us whether your fancy of abſolutely perfect Juſtification at the firſt will hold or not. I wonder that men ſhould ſo little know the difference betwixt Earth and Heaven; a ſinner in fleſh, and a Saint that is equal to the Angels of God? and ſhould dream of ſuch perfection ſhort of heaven, the place of our perfection?</p>
                  <p>His ſecond Argument is, <hi>[Faith and works are here contrary: If of Faith, then not of works]</hi> Anſwer. Its true of the works that <hi>Paul</hi> excludes: but not of the works that you exclude: For Faith <hi>in Chriſt</hi> is <hi>[Works]</hi> with ſuch as you, ſave only that act that reſteth on his ſatisfaction for righteouſneſs: And repentance and love to Chriſt, and denying our own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, are <hi>works</hi> with you. And all theſe are neceſſarily ſubſervient to Chriſt and Grace, and therefore not contrary. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and after him the School-men, put it into their moſt common de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of Grace, that its a thing <hi>[qua nemo male utitur.]</hi> And as to efficiency its certainly true: Grace doth not do any harm: And if I may preſume to tell <hi>Auguſtine</hi> that <hi>[objectively]</hi> Grace may be ill uſed, yet perhaps he might reply, [not <hi>qua talis, without contradiction</hi>] In good ſadneſs, Is it not a ſtrange thing for a man in his wits, to expect to be juſtified in co-ordination with Chriſts merits, by denying that he hath any merits of his own that can ſo juſtifie him, and by repenting of thoſe ſins that have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned him, and by deſiring, loving, hoping in Chriſt alone for his Juſtification: or by Thankfulneſs to God for juſtifying him by the ſole merits of Chriſt? And is it not a ſtrange Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:60968:158"/>
that feigneth <hi>Paul</hi> to mean and exclude ſuch acts as theſe under the name of works. But yet really if ſuch a man be to be found, that doth think to merit Juſtification by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying ſuch merit, I am againſt him as well as you.</p>
                  <p>His third Argument is, [<hi>If faith juſtifie only as the beginning of our Juſtification then there are degrees of Juſtification: but there are no degrees.</hi> Ergo.] <hi>Anſwer.</hi> 1. Faith is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Beginning nor End of Juſtification, but a means of it. 2. If you would inſinuate that I deny faith to be the means of our continued, as well as begun Juſtification, you deal deceitfully. 3. I deny your Conſequence. It may prove more neceſſary to the <hi>Continuance</hi> of our Juſtification, then to its beginning, and yet prove no degrees. 4. But how Juſtification hath or hath not Degrees, I have told you before; and fuller in other writings.</p>
                  <p>His fourth Argument is, <hi>[Becauſe good works do not precede, but follow Juſtification.]</hi> Anſwer. 1. Repentance, and the Love of God in Chriſt, and faith in Chriſt as Lord, and Head, and Teacher, do go before the pardon of ſin, and ſo before Juſtification. 2. External obedience goeth before Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at Judgement and Juſtification as continued here. Did you doubt of theſe?</p>
                  <p>His fifth Argument is, that <hi>[Theſe two Juſtifications over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw each other: If by one we have peace with God, what need the other? How can good works perfect our Juſtification, being themſelves imperfect?]</hi> Anſwer. All this is anſwered in the ſecond Diſputation. 1. Its no contradiction to be juſtified by God, by Chriſt, by Faith, by Words, by Works, if God be to be believed, that affirmeth all. 2. As imperfect faith may be the condition of pardon, ſo may imperfect Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and imperfect Obedience of our ſentential Abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 233. He anſwereth the Objection. <hi>[Bleſſedneſs is aſcribed to other Graces,]</hi> thus [<hi>Not as if Happineſs were in them,</hi> per ſe, <hi>but only as they are ſigns.</hi>] Anſwer. <hi>Promiſing</hi> is more then <hi>Aſcrbing:</hi> Its a great advantage for you to have the forming of your Objections. 2. Happineſs <hi>per ſe</hi> is as much in Love, as in Faith, and more. 3. Other, Graces
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:60968:159"/>
are <hi>media,</hi> means, which is more then only works.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 241. He proves that works juſtifie not ſubordinate to Faith] thus [Argument 1. <hi>No good works were found till faith had done its Works</hi>] Anſwer. 1. Faith hath not done its work till death; we are not juſtified only by the firſt act of faith: but by after-acts to the Death. 2. Faith in Chriſt as Head, and Lord, and Teacher, and Deſire and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance were found before Faith had juſtified us. 3. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience is found before the ſentential Juſtification, or the continuation of our firſt received Righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>His ſecond Argument is, <hi>[Becauſe good works are the effects of Faith and Juſtification, and therefore cannot be the cauſe.]</hi> Anſwer 1. They are none of the cauſe at all. Its not well to intimate that we hold them the cauſe, as in deſpight of all our own denyals. 2. They are not ſo much as Means or Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of that part of Juſtification, of which they are the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. The act of faith which you will exerciſe before your death, is as true a condition (or Inſtrument, if you will needs call it ſo) of your Juſtification as continued, as your firſt act of faith was of your Juſtification as begun. And yet that act of faith is but fruit of your firſt Juſtification, as well as Obedience is.</p>
                  <p>His third Argument is, that <hi>[If Goſpel Obedience, and good works do ſubordinately act with faith to the effecting of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, then the Juſtification which proceedeth from both, muſt be of a different kind and nature.]</hi> Anſwer 1. Neither faith nor work effect Juſtification. 2. Juſtification by Promiſe and Gift, and Juſtification by Sentence, Plea, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are much different. 3. But your conſequence is nothing worth. For theſe are not cauſes, but conditions. And if they were, yet different cauſes may concur to the ſame effect, which never man before you denyed, that I know of. Our caſe is, as if to a Rebell that hath forfeited Life and Eſtate, the King (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Ranſom) grant him both, on condition that he thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully accept them as the fruits of that gift and Ranſom, and to hold them on condition, that he often do his Homage to the King, and return not to Rebellion. Doth the firſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance here ſerve turn for continuance of what is firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:60968:159"/>
without the following Homage and Fidelity? or do the different parts of the condition make ſuch a difference in the benefit, as you here take the <hi>[Monſtrous Juſtification]</hi> to be (as you raſhly call it?)</p>
                  <p>Another Argument is. <hi>[If faith be a total cauſe or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of producing the effect of Juſtification, then there's no want of obedience for its aſſistance.]</hi> Anſwer 1. Faith or obedience are no cauſes of pardon. 2. I will not trouble the Reader to open the ſhame of that Philoſophy which you make ſuch oſtentation of. Only I would remember you, that cauſes total <hi>in ſuo genere,</hi> may have others under them. And that it followeth not, that the ſun ſhineth not, or the fire heateth not, or that you underſtand not, and wrote not theſe words, though I ſuppoſe you will ſay that God is <hi>Cauſa totalis</hi> of all theſe act: nor yet that God doth uſe his creatures becauſe of an inſufficiency in himſelf. 3. Faith taken for our <hi>[be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming Believers, Diſciples, Chriſtians]</hi> is the total condition of our firſt Receiving Juſtification. 2. Faith taken more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly for our accepting Chriſts Righteouſneſs, is not the total Condition of our firſt Receiving of Juſtification. 3. Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is part of the condition of the continuance of it, and of our ſentential Juſtification. And whereas you talk over and over of <hi>[Total cauſes, and particular cauſes.]</hi> I tell you again they are no cauſes.</p>
                  <p>He adds that then [<hi>Obedience doth</hi> nihil agere, <hi>or</hi> actum agere.] Anſwer. It doth <hi>nihil efficere.</hi> But beſides, <hi>[nihil]</hi> and <hi>[factum]</hi> there's two things oft mentioned, Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at Judgement, and the non-amiſſion of it here.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He inſipidly gain diſputes that <hi>[If an effect doth totally proceed from any cauſe, then it totally depends on it.]</hi> And what then? Therefore it ſolely dependeth on it: And if theſe things were true, what are they to our queſtion? But ſaith he, <hi>[When good works, the fruit of faith are interrupted, yet our Juſtification abides by the ſingle influence of faith only as a total cauſe of its being and conſervation.]</hi> Anſwer. 1. Alas! What would ſuch Diſputants do with the Church, if Gods mercy did not hinder them! By your own Argument now, neither God, nor Chriſt, nor the Goſpel are any cauſes of our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:60968:160"/>
For you ſay Faith is a <hi>Total cauſe,</hi> and there can be but one <hi>Total Cauſe,</hi> unleſs you loſe the honor of your Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy. 2. Faith is no proper cauſe at all. 3. Did you not ſee what muſt needs be anſwered you. That Faith is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted as well as Obedience, and yet no interciſion of our Juſtification. When we ſleep we do not (at leaſt alway) act faith no more then obedience (if ſo much.) And the habit of both continueth together ſleeping and waking: And if you ſhould give over love and ſincerity of obedience, you would ceaſe to be juſtified.</p>
                  <p>His laſt Argument is, <hi>[Becauſe for ſins after Converſion, we muſt have recourſe only by faith to Chriſt, as our Advocate.]</hi> Anſwer. 1. That ſpeaks only of renewed pardon for parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſins, but not of our Juſtification at Judgement, nor the non-omiſſion here. 2. We muſt have recourſe to Chriſt with Repentance, and eſteem, and ſelf-denial, and deſire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as well as that act of faith which you plead for, as the <hi>total cauſe.</hi> And when you would ſet <hi>Zanchy</hi> againſt <hi>Zanchy,</hi> you do but miſ-underſtand him. He ſaith truly with <hi>Paul,</hi> that neither in whole or part are our own works (ſuch as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of) our Righteouſneſs, that is, to anſwer the Law as <hi>Paul</hi> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneth, or any way to merit or ſatisfie, or ſtand in co-ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with Chriſt. But <hi>Zanchy</hi> never thought that Repentance and Faith in Chriſt as Head, and Lord, and Deſire and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> might be no means or Conditions of any ſort of Juſtification, or of that which we aſſert them to be means of.</p>
                  <p>I would anſwer much more of this Diſputation; but I am perſwaded the judicious Reader will think I have done him wrong, in troubling him with this much. See <hi>pag.</hi> 298, 299. how he anſwereth the Objection, that pardon is promiſed to Repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I will not diſparage the Readers under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſo much as to offer him a Confutation of that, and much more of the Book. Only his many Arguments on the Queſtion of my firſt Diſputation, I muſt crave your Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, while I examine briefly, and I will tire you with no more.</p>

                        <hi>pag.</hi> 411, 412. <hi>I will rally up my Arguments againſt the foreſaid Definition of Faith to be an accepting of Chriſt as Lord and Saviour: proving that Chriſt only as Saviour and Prieſt, offering himſelf up to the death of the Croſs for our ſins, is the proper Object of juſtifying Faith, as juſtifying.</hi> Argument 1. <hi>If the Faith of the Fathers under the old Teſtament was direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Chriſt as dying Prieſt and Saviour; then alſo the Faith of Believers now ought ſo to be directed.

                     <p>1. I grant the whole, and never made queſtion of it. But what kin is the concluſion of this Argument to that which you had to prove, unleſs <hi>[Only]</hi> had been added. Did we ever deny that Faith muſt be directed to Chriſt as Prieſt? 2. A Saviour is a term reſpecting our whole Salvation, and ſo Chriſt ſaveth by Teaching, Ruling, and judicial juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying as well as dying. 3. The Fathers faith did not reſpect Chriſt as dying or ſatisfying only, which you ſhould prove but cannot.</p>

                        <hi>Argument</hi> 2. <hi>If Chriſt as dying, and as Saviour do ſatisfie Gods Juſtice, and pacifie a ſinners conſcience, then as dying and Saviour he is the Object of juſtifying Faith. But —Ergo.—</hi>

                     <p>The ſame anſwer ſerveth to this as to the laſt. The concluſion is granted, but nothing to the Queſtion, unleſs <hi>[Only]</hi> had been in. 2. Chriſt as obeying actively, and Chriſt as Riſing, and as interceding, and as judging, as King, doth alſo juſtifie us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4 24, 25. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33.34. <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.37. and 25.34, 40. Peruſe theſe Texts impartially, and be ignorant of this if you can. 3. And yet the Argument will not hold, that no act of faith is the condition of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but thoſe whoſe object is conſidered only as juſtifying. The accepting of Chriſt to ſanctifie us, is a real part of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Juſtification.</p>

                     <p>Argument 3. <hi>If Chriſt as Lord be properly the Object of fear, then he is not properly the Object of Faith as juſtifying</hi>: But—<hi>Ergo.</hi>—</p>

                     <p>If <hi>[Properly]</hi> be ſpoken <hi>de proprio quarto modo,</hi> then is Chriſt properly the Object of neither, that is, he is not the object of either of theſe <hi>Only.</hi> 2. But if <hi>[pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly]</hi> be oppoſed to a tropical, analogical, or any ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper ſpeech, then he is the Object as Lord, both of fear, and faith, and obedience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. The deceit that ſtill miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leads moſt men in this point, is in the terms of reduplication, <hi>[faith as juſtifying,]</hi> which men that look not through the bark, do ſwallow without ſufficient chewing, and ſo wrong themſelves and others by meer words. Once more therefore underſtand, that when men diſtinguiſh between <hi>fides quae juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficans,</hi> and <hi>qua juſtificans,</hi> and ſay, <hi>[Faith which juſtifieth, accepteth Chriſt as Head and Lord; but faith as juſtifying, taketh him only as a Prieſt.]</hi> The very diſtinction in the later branch of it, <hi>[qua juſtificans.]</hi> Is 1. Either palpable falſe Doctrine. 2. And a meer begging of the Queſtion. 3. Or elſe co-inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent with the other branch, and ſo contradictory to their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion. For 1. The common Intent and meaning is, that [<hi>Fides quae credit in Chriſtum juſtificat</hi>: And ſo they ſuppoſe that Faith is to be denominated formally <hi>[juſtificans] ab objecto qua objectum:</hi> And if this be true, then <hi>fides qua fides juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat</hi>: For the object is eſſential to faith <hi>in ſpecie.</hi> And ſo in their ſenſe, <hi>[fides quae juſtificans]</hi> is but the implication of this falſe Doctrine, that <hi>haec fides in Chriſtum crucifixum qua talis juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficat.</hi> Which I never yet met with ſober Divine that would own when he ſaw it opened. For the nature and eſſence of faith, is but its aptitude to the office of juſtifying, and it is the Covenant or free Gift of God <hi>in modo promittendi,</hi> that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigneth it its office. The nature of faith is but the <hi>Diſpoſitio materiae</hi>; but its neareſt <hi>intereſt</hi> in the effect is as a condition of the Promiſe performed. 2. But if by the <hi>[quâ juſtificans]</hi> any ſhould intend no more then to define the nature mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially of that faith which is the condition of Juſtification, then
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:60968:161"/>
the <hi>qua</hi> and the <hi>qua</hi> is all one: and then they contradict their own Aſſertion, that <hi>[fides quâ juſtificans non recipit Chriſtum ut Dominum.]</hi> 3. If the <hi>[quâ]</hi> ſhould relate to the effect, then it would only expreſs a diſtinction between <hi>Juſtification</hi> and other <hi>Benefits,</hi> and not between faith and faith. For then <hi>[quâ juſtiſtcans]</hi> ſhould be contradiſtinct only from <hi>[qua ſanctificans]</hi> or the like. And if ſo, it is one and the ſame Faith and the ſame acts of faith, that ſanctifie and juſtifie. As if a King put into a gracious act, to a company of Rebels, that they ſhall be pardoned, honoured, enriched, and all upon condition of their thankfull acceptance of him, and of this act of Grace: Here there is no room to diſtinguiſh of their Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as if the acceptance of pardon were the condition of pardon, and the acceptance of riches were the condition of their Riches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But it is the ſame acceptance of their Prince and his Act of Grace, that hath relation to the ſeveral conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent benefits, &amp; may be called pardoning, honouring &amp; enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſeveral reſpects. It is the ſame marriage of a Prince that makes a woman rich, honourable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So it is the ſame faith in whole Chriſt, as Chriſt, that is ſanctifying and juſtifying, as it relateth to the ſeveral Benefits: that is, it is the condition of both, ſo that their <hi>[quâ juſtifi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

no more then what I grant, that is, that Chriſt as cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, is the object of juſtifying faith. But wheres the <hi>[Only,]</hi> or any excluſive of the reſt. 2. But if it be implyed, then 1.

No act of Faith effecteth our Juſtification: and whole faith is the condition: The being or Nature of no act is the formal or neareſt reaſon of faiths Intereſt in Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation It juſtifieth not <hi>[as this act, nor as that.]</hi> 2. If <hi>[only]</hi> or ſome excluſive be not implyed in the concluſion, I grant it ſtill: But if it be, then both Major and Minor are falſe. 1. The Major is falſe, for it is not only the matter of our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, that is the object of juſtifying faith. To affirm this, is but to beg the queſtion: we expect your proof. 2. The
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:60968:162"/>
                        <hi>Minor</hi> is falſe: for beſides the ſufferings mentioned, the very perſon of Chriſt, and the active obedience of Chriſt, and the Title to pardon given us in the Goſpel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> apprehended by faith do juſtifie. But the queſtion is not what juſtifieth <hi>ex parts Chriſti,</hi> but <hi>ex parte noſtri.</hi>

                        <hi>Mr.</hi> W.</speaker>
                     <p>Argument 7. <hi>That which the Gospel doth firſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent us with, is the Object of faith as juſtifying: But Chriſt is in the Gospel firſt preſented as a Saviour: therefore he is therein the object of faith as juſtifying.</hi>

                     <p>Diſtinguiſhing as before of the <hi>[as juſtifying]</hi> I ſtill grant the whole; the excluſive and ſo the queſtion is ſtill wanting in the concluſion. 2. But if he mean <hi>only,</hi> then both <hi>Maior</hi> and <hi>Minor</hi> are falſe. The <hi>Maior</hi> is falſe; for that which the Goſpel doth firſt preſent us with, is but <hi>part</hi> of the object of juſtifying Faith. For it preſenteth us with the Articles to which we muſt Aſſent, and to the Good which we muſt Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept by degrees, and not all in a ſentence or word. The <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> is falſe, becauſe in order of nature, the Deſcription of Chriſts Perſon goeth firſt, and of his Office afterward. 3. The word <hi>Saviour,</hi> comprehendeth both his Prophetical and Kingly Office, by which he ſaveth us from ſin and Hell; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo his Reſurrection, Aſcention, Interceſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in this large ſenſe I eaſily grant the Concluſion. 4. If by a <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,</hi> he mean only (as his cauſe importeth) a ſacrifice for ſin, then (as this is a ſtrangely limited ſenſe of the word <hi>Saviour,</hi> ſo) certainly the Incarnation, Baptiſm, Temptation, Miracles, Obedience of Chriſt are all expreſt before this; And if it were otherwiſe, yet the conſequence of the <hi>Maior</hi> is utterly ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and vain. Priority or Poſteriority of any point delivered in the Goſpel, is a poor Argument to prove it the Object (much leſs it alone) of juſtifying faith.</p>

                     <p>Argument 8. <hi>That which the Lords Supper doth as a ſeal preſent to juſtifying faith, that is the object of faith as juſtifying: But the Lords Supper doth preſent us with Chriſt as dying.</hi>—Ego.</p>

                     <p>Argument 9. <hi>If we have Redemption and remiſſion of ſins through faith in his blood, then faith as juſtifying ſhould only look upon that: But we have redemption and remiſſion of ſins by his blood,</hi> Col. 1.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Anſw.</speaker>
                     <p>Here's one Argument that hath the queſtion in the concluſion. But 1. I deny the conſequence of the <hi>Major,</hi> as not by Chriſtians to be endured. The <hi>[only]</hi> followeth not. Though we muſt be juſtified by his blood, I have proved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that we are alſo juſtified by his Reſurrection, Obedience, Interceſſion, Judgement, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. Moreover the conſequence is falſe on another account: Juſtifying faith, that is, Faith the condition of Juſtification, muſt look at more in Chriſt, then that which purchaſeth Redemption. It juſtifieth not effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently, nor of its own nature, but the Promiſe juſtifieth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faiths co-efficiency; only it makes the condition <hi>ſine qua non:</hi> and this it may do by another Act of faith, as well as that which apprehendeth the Ranſom. 3. The <hi>[qua juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans]</hi> I have ſpoke to: <hi>Qua</hi> cannot here properly refer to the nature of the faith, but to the Benefit. And ſo faith <hi>qua juſtificans,</hi> is neither this act, nor that act, nor any act; but <hi>[qua juſtificans]</hi> noteth only its reſpect to Juſtification ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to Sanctification, or other benefits. As when I kindle a fire, I thereby occaſion both Light and Heat, by putting to the fewel. And if you ſpeak of that act of mine [<hi>qua calefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciens</hi>: or <hi>qua illuminans</hi>] this doth not diſtinguiſh of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the act, but of the Reſpect that the ſame Act hath to ſeveral effects or conſequents.</p>

                     <p>Argument 10. <hi>If Chriſt only as crucified be the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious Cauſe of our Redemption and Juſtification, then Chriſt crucified is the only object of faith as Juſtifying. But</hi>—Ergo.</p>

                     <p>The conſequence of the <hi>Major</hi> is vain and an proved. More then the Meritorious Cauſe of our Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is the object of juſtifying faith. 2. The <hi>Minor</hi> is no ſmall errour in the Judgement of moſt Proteſtants, who maintain that Chriſts active Obedience, and ſuffering life, are alſo the Meritorious cauſe of our Juſtification, and not only his Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixion.</p>

                     <p>Argument 11. <hi>If Chriſt as a ſervant did ſatisfie Gods Juſtice, then he is ſo to be believed on to Juſtification. But as a ſervant he did ſatisfie Gods Juſtice.</hi>—Ergo.</p>

                     <p>I grant the concluſion. Chriſt as a ſervant is to be believed in. 2. But if <hi>[only]</hi> was again forgotten, I further anſwer. 1. I deny the conſequence of the <hi>Major,</hi> becauſe Chriſt is to be believed on for Juſtification in other reſpects, even in all eſſential to his Office, and not only as ſatisfying. I inſtanced before in Obeying, Riſing, Judging, from expreſs Scripture. 2. If the concluſion were granted, its againſt you and not for you. For 1. Active obedience is as proper to a ſervant as ſuffering. 2. Chriſt <hi>Taught</hi> the Church as a ſervant to his Father, and is expreſly called <hi>A Miniſter of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion.</hi> So that theſe you yield the objects of this faith.</p>

                        <hi>Mr.</hi> W.</speaker>
                     <p>Argument 12. <hi>If none can call Chriſt</hi> [Lord] <hi>before he be juſtified by faith, then faith as juſtifying is not an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting him as Lord. The</hi> Minor <hi>is true, becauſe none can call him Lord, but by the Spirit: and the Spirit is received by the hearing of faith, after we believe.</hi>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Anſw.</speaker>
                     <p>Any thing muſt ſerve. 1. Both <hi>Major</hi> and <hi>Minor</hi> are ſuch as are not to be ſwallowed in the lump. If by <hi>[Call]</hi> you mean the <hi>call</hi> of the voyce, then the conſequence of the <hi>Major</hi> is vain and groundleſs. For a man may believe in Chriſt with the <hi>heart</hi> as Lord and Saviour, before he <hi>call</hi> him ſo with the mouth. But if by <hi>[Call]</hi> you mean <hi>[Believe]</hi> then the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> is falſe &amp; ſo confeſſed by all Proteſtants and Chriſtians that
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:60968:164"/>
ever I heard from of this point, till now: For they all confeſs that faith in Chriſt as Lord and Teacher, and Head, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is the <hi>fides quae juſtificat,</hi> or is of neceſſity to be preſent with the believing in his blood, that a man may be juſtified. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did I hear till now that we firſt believe in Chriſt as dying only, and ſo are juſtified before we believe in him as Lord, (and it ſeems before we are his Subjects or Diſciples, and that is, before we are Chriſtians.) 2. To your proof of the <hi>Minor</hi> I anſwer, 1. It is no proof becauſe the Text ſaith only that, <hi>[No man can call him Lord but by the Spirit]</hi> but our queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is of <hi>Believing,</hi> and not of <hi>Calling</hi> which is <hi>Confeſſing.</hi> 2. Many Expoſitors take it but for a common gift of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit thats there ſpoken of: and do you think Juſtification muſt needs precede ſuch common gifts? 3. But if it had been [<hi>Believe</hi> in ſtead of <hi>Call</hi>] its nothing for you: For I eaſily grant that no man can <hi>believe</hi> in Chriſt as Lord but by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: but I deny that this gift of the Spirit is never received, till after that we believe and are juſtified. And becauſe it ſeems you judge that Believing in Chriſt to Juſtification is without the Spirit, I pray anſwer firſt what we have ſaid againſt the <hi>Arminians,</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> againſt the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Who would have thought that you had held ſuch a point? 4. How could you wink ſo hard as not to ſee that your Argument is as much againſt your ſelf as me, if you do but turn it thus? [<hi>If none can call Chriſt Jeſus, or the Saviour, or believe in him to Juſtification, before he be juſtified by faith, then faith as juſtifying is not the accepting him as a Saviour:</hi> The <hi>Minor</hi> is proved, becauſe none can call him Jeſus, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to Juſtification but by the Spirit] This is as wiſe and ſtrong an Argument as the other, and all one. See 1 <hi>Iob.</hi> 4.15. &amp; 5.5. Believing in Chriſt as Saviour is as much of the Spirit, is believing in him as Lord. 5. The Text makes againſt you (1 <hi>Cor</hi> 12.3.) For there when <hi>Paul</hi> would denominate the true Chriſtian faith or Confeſſion, he maketh Chriſt as Lord the Object.</p>

                     <p>Argument 13. <hi>If the promiſe of Salvation be the proper object of juſtifying faith, then not the commands of Chriſt as Lord and Law-giver. But</hi>—Ergo</p>

                     <p>The concluſion is nothing to our Queſtion, which is not of <hi>Commands,</hi> but of Chriſt as <hi>Lord.</hi> It may be you know no difference between the Relation and ſubſequent Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, between the Authority and the Command, between ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection and obedience. 2. The <hi>Minor</hi> is falſe, If by <hi>proper,</hi> you mean <hi>Only</hi> (and if not, the conſequence is vain and null.) For the Perſon of Chriſt, and his Office, and the fruits of his Office, even Pardon, yea and Glory, are the true Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of juſtifying Faith.</p>

                     <p>Argument 14. <hi>If we are not juſtified both by Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs Inherent and Imputed, then not by obeying Chriſt as Lord and Law-giver. But</hi>—Ergo.</p>

                     <p>Whats this to the Queſtion? 1. About Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Righteouſneſs Imputed or Inherent we ſpoke before. 2. The concluſion never was acquainted with our Queſtion? Again it ſeems you cannot or will not diſtinguiſh between Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative ſubjection and actual obedience. A man may become your ſervant and ſo have the Priviledges of a ſervant, by cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, before he obey you. A woman in Marriage may ſubject her ſelf to you, and have Intereſt in your eſtate even by that Marriage which promiſeth ſubjection as well as Love (without excluding the firſt from being any condition of her Intereſt;) and all this before ſhe obey you, 3. Your conſequence would follow as much againſt your ſelf as me. For Believing in Chriſt as a Ranſom, is as truly a particular Inherent Righteouſneſs, as believing in him as Lord. 4. We are juſtified by Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs Inherent as a particular righteouſneſs, though not as a U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal: as ſubordinate to Chriſts Righteouſneſs that it may be ours, though not in co-ordination with it.</p>

                     <p>Argument 15. <hi>If our accepting of Chriſt as Lord and Law-giver be not properly or formally faith, nor properly to be called obedience, then we are not formally juſtified by faith in him as Lord, nor by our obedience to him as Lord. But ſuch an accepting of him is not properly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or in the account of God, or in it
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:60968:165"/>
ſelf Faith or obedience.</hi> Ergo.—<hi>The Minor I prove: if pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, intentions, or verbal profeſſions to believe or obey are not properly faith obedience, then ſuch an accepting is not faith or obedience. The Minor proved. That which is or may be found in Hypocrites or Reprobates is not true faith or obedience. Bu</hi> —Ergo.</p>

                     <p>The Lord pardon the hardneſs of my heart that hath no more compaſſionate ſenſe of the miſeries of that poor Church, and the diſhonour of God which ſuch Diſputes as this proclaim; by Arguments as fit to be anſwered by Tears as by words. 1. A little before he was proving (<hi>Argument</hi> 12.) that none could call Chriſt Lord but by the Spirit, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this act was after Juſtification: And now he proveth that its common to Hypocrites, &amp; Reprobates. 2. Here he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livereth me from all the trouble and fallacy that the diſtinction of <hi>fides quae Juſtificat</hi> and <hi>fides qua Juſtificat,</hi> hath been guilty of. For if the act that we diſpute about, be no faith at all, then it is not the <hi>fides quae.</hi> And yet he often is upon the <hi>Qua Juſtificans</hi> himſelf, forgetting this.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <p n="3">3. Had I but delivered ſuch a Doctrine as this, what ſhould I have heard? Juſtifying faith hath three Parts, ASSENT, CONSENT, and AFFIANCE, (which alſo have ſeveral acts or parts, according to the divers eſſential parts of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.) ASSENT is but Initial and introductory to the reſt, as all acts of the Intellect are to thoſe of the Will. CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SENT is the ſame which we here call ACCEPTING, which is but the meer VOLITION denominated from its reſpect to the offer and thing offered. This, as it is in the will, the commanding Faculty, ſo is it as it were the Heart of Faith; the firſt act being but to lead in this, and AFFIANCE the third, being commanded much by this, or depending on it: For as it is ſeated in the Affections, ſo far it is diſtinct from this <hi>Velle</hi> or CONSENT. Now when ever we name <hi>Faith</hi> by any one of theſe three acts (as the Scripture doth from every one) we include them all, though to avoid tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs we ſtand not to name all the parts, when ever by one word we expreſs the whole. And all theſe Acts have whole
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:60968:165"/>
Chriſt in all the eſſentials of his Perſon and office for their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. Now that this faith in Chriſt as Lord, or accepting him, ſhould be ſaid, and that by a Chriſtian Divine, and that in the Reformed Church, to be no faith at all, (to ſay nothing of his denying it to be obedience;) is no matter of honour or comfort to us. How oft doth the Scripture expreſly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt? Receiving Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, <hi>Col</hi> 2.6. with other equipollent terms. But I will not offer to trouble any Chriſtian Reader with Arguments for ſuch a Truth.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But yet the man would be thought to have Reaſon for what he ſaith; and to his proof I further anſwer. 1. <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, Intentions,</hi> and <hi>verbal Profeſſions</hi> were none of the terms or things in queſtion: but <hi>Accepting</hi> or <hi>Believing in Chriſt as Lord, Teacher,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe are but concomitants (the two firſt) and (the laſt) a conſequent. 2. Is it the Act <hi>[Accepting]</hi> that this Brother diſputeth againſt, or is it the Object <hi>[Chriſt as Lord]</hi> as being none of the faith by which we are juſtified? If it be the former, 1. What Agreement then hath this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with all the reſt, or with his queſtion? 2. What Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath his Judgement with the holy Scripture, that calleth Faith a <hi>Receiving of Chriſt,</hi> and maketh it equipollent with <hi>[Believing in his Name]</hi> John 1.11.12. Col. 2.6. 3. What Agreement hath his Judgement with the Proteſtant Faith, that maketh Chriſt himſelf as Good to be the Object of faith; to be embraced, or choſen, or accepted by the will, as well as the word as True, to be Aſſented to by the underſtanding. But if it be the <hi>Object</hi> that he meaneth, then what force or ſenſe is there in his Argument, from the terms, <hi>[Purpoſing, Intending, Confeſſing?]</hi> Let him name what Act he pleaſe, ſo it reſpect this Object; and if it be an Act of faith indeed, its all one as to our preſent Controverſie. If he take <hi>Conſent, willing,</hi> or <hi>Accepting</hi> of Chriſt to be no act of Faith, let him name any other that he will own (for I would <hi>quarrel</hi> as little as may be about words, or impertinent things,) and let that be it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And how could he chooſe but ſee, that his Argument is as much againſt <hi>[Accepting Chriſt as Prieſt]</hi> as againſt <hi>[Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting him as Lord]</hi> to Juſtification? No doubt but a man
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:60968:166"/>
that had the common Reaſon to write but ſuch a book as this, muſt needs ſee this if he regard what he ſaid. And therefore I muſt take it for granted that his Argument is againſt both alike: even to prove that Accepting of Chriſt as Lord, or as Saviour, is no faith or obedience at all. But the Reader will hardly believe till he weigheth it, that a waking man would reaſon thus upon ſuch a Queſtion as this in hand.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Conſenting that Chriſt ſhall be my Lord and Teacher, and Head, doth imply a conſent, and ſo a Purpoſe of future obeying, learning and receiving from him; And ſo conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Chriſt ſhall be my Righteouſneſs, Interceſſor, and Juſtifier, doth imply a Purpoſe of Truſting in him for the future.

I ſay faith Phyſically taken, is many acts; but moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken it is one work: Hence you call out to the Reader to obſerve, that I will not allow you any Phyſical but a Moral Acception of it.] Is it fit to Diſpute with ſuch dealing as this? Do you think that I or any man of brains doth doubt whether faith be a Phyſical Act (except them of late that take it to be but a Paſſion and a Nominal action?) Surely all know that it is an Act in order of Nature, before it is a moral act. <hi>Actus moralis,</hi> is firſt <hi>actus Phyſicus.</hi> Though <hi>Moraliter actus, i. e. actus Reputativus,</hi> may be but a non-acting Phyſically: He that wilfully famiſheth his own child, doth kill him morally or reputatively, and ſo is <hi>moraliter agens,</hi> that is, Reputative.

this diſtinction and the light he received by it that induced him to enter on this Diſcourſe; and that it is the baſis of his following exercitation. And what think you is the happy Light that deſerveth all this oſtentation? Why 1. On the Negative we are ſatisfied that he means not [<hi>What fides qua fides can do</hi>:] And then we are ſecure that he means nothing that can hurt his Adverſaries cauſe. 2. The Light then is all but this [<hi>That qua here is not taken Reduplicative, but ſpecifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, when by the particle</hi> qua <hi>or</hi> quatenus, <hi>there is ſome new or ſingular kind of Denomination added to the ſubject of the Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: as when we ſay, man as a reaſonable creature feeleth: In this latter ſence</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I believe the particle</hi> qua <hi>or</hi> quate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus <hi>is taken, when we do not ſay, faith as faith, but faith as Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying,</hi> viz. <hi>as a Grace deſigned to this act or operation of Juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, looks on Chriſt as Saviour.</hi>]</p>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Chapter was worth the obſerving. For if this be the Baſis of all the Exercitation, and the Light that Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated all the reſt, the diſpatch of this may ſerve for all. It ſeems by his words he had look't into <hi>Reebe's Diſtinctions</hi> in the end of <hi>Caſtaneus,</hi> and meeing with <hi>Reduplicative</hi> and <hi>specificative,</hi> admired the diſtinction as ſome rare Diſcovery: and this preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant fruitful Diſtinction begot a Volume, before it was half underſtood it ſelf. Had he but read the large Schemes for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining <hi>Qua</hi> or <hi>Quatenus</hi> in others, its like it would have either begot a larger Volume, or by informing or confounding him, have prevented this. Firſt, he diſowneth the <hi>Reduplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> ſence; and then owneth the <hi>specificative.</hi> But 1. He ſeeth not, it ſeems, the inſufficiency of this diſtinction; 2. Nor the meaning of it; 3. Nor could well apply it to the ſubject in hand. Of the firſt I ſhall ſpeak anon. The ſecond appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by his Deſcription, his Inſtance, and his Application. He deſcribeth it to be <hi>[When there is ſome new or ſingular kind of Denomination added to the ſubject of the Propoſition.]</hi> 1. And why may it not be added alſo to the Predicate, as well as it may <hi>Reduplicatively?</hi> as <hi>Motus eſt actus mobilis quatenus eſt mobile.</hi>

                        <pb n="310" facs="tcp:60968:169"/>Now for the opening of the matter in hand, let us try cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Propoſitions that may be ſuppoſed to be laid down con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Faith.</p>
                     <p>[1. <hi>Faith as faith juſtifieth</hi>] This is <hi>True,</hi> taken <hi>laxely,</hi> for the excluding of [<hi>faith as a meer Phyſical act, or meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> &amp;c.] but it is <hi>falſe ſtrictly</hi> taken, as ſignifying the formal or neareſt reaſon.</p>
                     <p>So [2. <hi>Fades in Chriſtum qua talis Juſtificat</hi>] that is, <hi>haec ſides in ſpecie</hi>] is <hi>true,</hi> taken <hi>Laxely and materially</hi> to exclude all other Faith: <hi>q. d. It is not faith in</hi> Peter <hi>or</hi> Paul, <hi>but faith in Chriſt as ſuch that is the matter deputed, to be the condition of Juſtification.</hi> But its <hi>falſe</hi> taken <hi>ſtrictly, deratione formali.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. So <hi>[This faith as it is an Apprehenſion or Acceptance of Chriſt, juſtifieth.</hi>] Its true, <hi>Materialiter &amp; Remotius, Laxly:</hi> but <hi>falſe formaliter &amp; ſtricte de ratione proxima.</hi> For this is the ſame in other terms with the ſecond.</p>
                     <p>So [4. <hi>Faith juſtifieth as an Inſtrumental effitient cauſe of our Juſtification.</hi>] Its <hi>falſe</hi> in every tolerable ſence.</p>
                     <p>So [5. <hi>Faith juſtifieth as an Inſtrument of receiving Chriſt.</hi>] Its true, 1. taking the word <hi>[Inſtrument</hi>] Metaphorically, and meaning only the <hi>Nature of this faith,</hi> which is <hi>[to Believe in and Accept Chriſt.]</hi> 2. and taking <hi>Quatenus remotely, laxely</hi> and <hi>materially</hi> only, q.d. <hi>Faith is the Elected matter of the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> (or is choſen to be the condition of Juſtification) <hi>for this Aptitude, as, or becauſe it is a Reception or Acceptance of Chriſt.</hi> But its falſe, 1.

                     </p>
                     <p>So [6. <hi>Faith as a believing in Chriſts ſacrifice, juſtifieth.</hi>] Its true, <hi>Laxly, Materialiter &amp; partialiter</hi>: that is, <hi>This act of faith is part of the matter of the condition.</hi> But its falſe, <hi>forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter de ratione proxima.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So [7. <hi>Faith juſtifieth only as it is a Believing in Chriſts ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice or Righteouſneſs.</hi>] Its falſe both <hi>de materia &amp; de ratione formali.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So [8. <hi>Faith as Juſtifying is only a Believing in, or Accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt as our Ranſom</hi>] Here is darkneſs, and either non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence or falſe doctrine. 1. <hi>[As Juſtifying]</hi> ſignifieth either <hi>[as a juſtifying efficient cauſe]</hi> 2. Or <hi>[as the merit or matter of
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:60968:169"/>
our Righteouſneſs.</hi>] 3. Or <hi>[as the means i. e. condition of our Righteouſneſs, of which Juſtification is a conſequent and final cauſe.</hi>] In the firſt ſenſe it is every way falſe. In the ſecond ſenſe it is every way falſe, ſpeaking of our Univerſal Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. In the third ſenſe, if ſpoken <hi>laxely de materia,</hi> its falſe, becauſe of the excluſive <hi>[Only.</hi>] And if ſpoken <hi>de ratione for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malivel proxima,</hi> 1. Its prepoſterous to put the Conſequent before the Antecedent, if you ſpeak <hi>de ordine exequendi:</hi> 2. And it is falſe: For <hi>[qua Juſtificans]</hi> ſpeaketh of Juſtification as the conſequent, or as an act, and not of the Nature of Faith it ſelf. And therefore <hi>[qua Juſtificans]</hi> faith <hi>is nothing</hi> (much leſs that act alone.) For it is not <hi>de eſſe fidei</hi> that the term ſpeaks, but of the conſequent; So that the <hi>[Fides qua juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans eſt]</hi> what ever act you mention, is abſurd and unſound: For as <hi>non juſtificat quatenus eſt, it a non eſt quatenus Juſtificat,</hi> its Eſſence being pre-ſuppoſed. But if you ſpeak <hi>de ordine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentionis,</hi> viz. [<hi>Faith as elected a means or condition of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is only a Believing in Chriſts ſacrifice.]</hi> then <hi>Laxely &amp; Materially</hi> it would be <hi>True,</hi> if it were not for the [<hi>only.</hi>] But becauſe of that it is falſe, both <hi>de materia &amp; de ratione for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mali.</hi> The nature of it is before its Office.</p>
                     <p>So [9. <hi>Faith as deſigned to this act or operation of Juſtifying, looks on Chriſt as a Saviour.</hi>] This is Mr. <hi>Ws.</hi> Aſſertion. But 1. <hi>juſtifying</hi> is not an <hi>act or operation</hi> of <hi>faith</hi>; but of <hi>God</hi> on the Believer. 2. But if you mean but conſtituting it the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Juſtification, then 1. the wrong end is ſet firſt: For it doth not look at Chriſt, as its made the condition; but its made the condition, becauſe being an Accepting of Chriſt, its Apt for that Office. So that <hi>Materially and Laxely,</hi> its thus true; (a Saviour, comprehendeth Chriſts Kingly and Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Offices, and everlaſting Prieſthood in Heaven) But this is nothing to the formal Reaſon of its Intereſt in Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>But leſt you think that <hi>[qua Juſtificans]</hi> hath no proper place, I further inſtance [9. <hi>Faith as juſtifying is diſtinst from faith as entitling to Heaven, or other promiſed mercies.</hi>] This is true (ſuppoſing Juſtification and the ſaid Title to Glory to differ.) But this is but a denomination of the ſame faith from
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:60968:170"/>
its divers conſequents. As my lighting a candle being one acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is <hi>Actioilluminans (ut cauſa moralis,) &amp; calefaciens; &amp; quailluminans non eſt calefaciens.</hi> So a womans marrying a Prince, is an Honouring, enriching act: and <hi>qua honouring,</hi> it is not <hi>enriching.</hi> But its the ſame entire undivided act or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent Means, or Condition, that is thus variouſly denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from ſeveral Benefits. And thus Relations may give divers denominations to the ſame perſon; the ſame man may, be conſidered as a Father, as a Phyſitian, as a Subject, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>So 10. FAITH WHICH IS AN EFFECTUAL AC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CEPTANCE OF and AFFIANCE IN CHRIST AS CHRIST, <hi>was</hi> CHOSEN and ORDAINED <hi>by God the Condition of Juſtification and Life, becauſe his Wiſdom ſaw it fit for that Office, and that fitneſs lyeth in its respect to the Object and Gods ends</hi> (ſuppoſing we may aſſign Reaſons or cauſes of Gods Will.) <hi>By this faith</hi> (ſo conſtituted the Condition) <hi>we are actually</hi> JUSTIFIED AS TIS THE PERFORMED CONDITION OF GODS PROMISE.] This is the plain Truth in few and eaſie words.</p>
                     <p>By what is ſaid you may ſee that when they ſay <hi>[faith as Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying]</hi> is this or that, it is both prepoſterous, and the <hi>[qua]</hi> as diſtinct from the <hi>[quae] de ratione formali,</hi> cauſally ſpoken, is plainly falſe: But in other caſes, <hi>Laxely and Materially,</hi> the <hi>[qua]</hi> ſignifieth the ſame as the <hi>[quae]</hi> with the excluſion of other matter. And when they have raiſed never ſo great a duſt, the Queſtion is but this: <hi>Whether we are juſtified by Believing in Chriſt as Chriſt, or only in Chriſt as a Ranſom</hi>] (and yet as a Ranſom and as dying he purchaſeth Sanctification as well as Juſtification.) Or. <hi>[Whether faith in Chriſt as Chriſt, or only faith in Chriſt as Purchaſing Juſtification, be the condition of our Juſtification.]</hi>

                  <p>THough (through the privacy of my habitation) I never ſo much as heard of your name, before your Book of the <hi>Object</hi> and <hi>Office</hi> of faith was in the Preſs; yet upon tht peruſal of it I confidently conclude, that a zeal for God, and that which you verily think to be his Truth, hath moved you to this undertaking; and doubtleſs you think that you have done God ſervice by it. I love your zeal: and your indignation againſt Error; and your tenderneſe of ſo great a point as that of Juſtification. And could I find your Light to be anſwerable to your heat, I hope I ſhould alſo love and honour it: Had you not taken me (with the two Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verened Brethren whom you oppoſe) to be <hi>the enemies of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Grace of the Lord Jeſus, or the followers of them</hi> (as you ſay, Epiſt. pag. <hi>6.</hi>) I am perſwaded you would not have either called us ſo, or thought your ſelf called to this aſſault. And if I love Chriſt, I muſt love that man that hateth me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kingly, for the ſake of Chriſt. That principle within you that hath made Chriſt and Truth ſo dear to you, that you riſe up for that which ſeemeth to you to be Truth, I hope will grow till you attain perfection in that world of Light that will end our differences, I ſhall not go about to dèprecate your indignation for my plain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions in this Defence, when the nature of your matter did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire them: For I am not ſo unreſonable as to expect that fair words ſhould reconcile a good man to thoſe that he takes to be ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to Chriſt, or to their followers. But as I can truly ſay if I know what is in my heart, that the Reading of your Book hath
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:60968:171"/>
bred no enmity to you in my breſt, but only kindled a love to your zeal, with a compaſſion of your darkneſs, and a diſlike of your ſo much confidence in the dark; ſo it ſhall be my care as it is my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to love you as a miſtaken ſervant of Chriſt, though you ſhould take me for his greateſt enemy. And therefore being conſcious of no worſe affections to you, I deſire that Juſtice of you, as to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the ungratefull paſſages that you meet with, to my apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the badneſs of your cauſe and Arguments, and a compaſſion to the poor Church that muſt be troubled and tempted, and endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered by ſuch groſs miſtakes, and not to any contempt of your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, with which I meddle not, but as you are the Author of thoſe Arguments.</p>
                  <p>In your Preface I find a Law impoſed by you on your Anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, which I have not fully obſerved: <hi>1.</hi> Becauſe I had written my Reply to your Arguments a conſiderable time before I ſaw your Preface; For it fell out that I firſt ſaw your Book without the Epiſtle and Preface. <hi>2.</hi> Becauſe I thought it fitteſt to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Method that my Subject and the Readers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>dification did require. <hi>3.</hi> Yet did I once purpoſe to have anſwered all that was of moment in your Book againſt the Truth: but upon trial I found your Reaſons ſo inconſiderable, that wearineſs interrupted me and put an end to my Reply, and withal I grew confident that my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour would be to little purpoſe. For I dare venture any Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Divine upon your Book without the help of a Reply: And for the reſt, it is not replying that will ſerve turn: but either preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice will hold them to the ſide that they have taken, or elſe they will think him in the right that hath the laſt word: when they have read mine, they will think that I am in the right; and when they have again read yours, they will think that you carry the cauſe: and when they read my Reply again they will ſay, you were miſtaken; but uſually they will go with the party that is in great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt credit, or hath moſt intereſt in them, or advantage on them. But yet I think you will find that none of your ſtrength againſt me is neglected: For I can truly ſay, that when I think not meet to Anſwer all that a man hath ſaid, I never paſs by that which I take to be his ſtrength, but purpoſely call out that, and leave that which I think is ſo groſly weak as to need no anſwer: So much of your ten Demands or Laws as I apprehended neceſſary, I have
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:60968:171"/>
here anſwered; ſuppoſing what I had ſaid of the ſame points in my firſt Diſputation, which I ſaw no Reaſon too often to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat.</p>
                  <p>I am none of thoſe that <hi>blame you for too much of the Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſicks,</hi> but rather mervail that you feared not leſt your Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical Reader will wrong you by miſ-applying your cited <hi>Scheg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kius</hi> contrary to your better opinion of your ſelf, and take both your <hi>Schegkius</hi> and your <hi>Scaliger</hi> for Prophets that could ſpeak as if they had read your Book, and been acquainted with your ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guings. But it ſeems you are not the firſt of that way.</p>
                  <p>By your Arguments in your Preface, I perceive you think it a matter of very great moment to your cauſe, to prove that there are divers acts of Faith, whereas I am ſo far from denying it, that I am ready to demonſtrate, that even the faith by which we are Juſtified, is liker to have twenty acts then one only, but many certainly it hath. Your firſt Argument is, from the different ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects becauſe the Objects ſpecifie the Acts. A ſufficient Argument which no man can confute. But <hi>1.</hi> This is no proof, that one act only is it that we are juſtified by. <hi>2.</hi> Where you add that Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Faith hath not reſpect to Chriſt as Lord <hi>formaliter,</hi> you beg the Queſtion, and aſſert no light miſtake. But where you add <hi>[in its act of Juſtifying]</hi> you do but obtrude upon us your funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Error (which leadeth you to the reſt) by naked affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Faith hath properly no juſtifying act: <hi>Juſtificare eſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficere,</hi> Faith doth not effect our Juſtification: we are juſtified by faith indeed, but not as by an efficient cauſe unleſs you will take Juſtification for Sanctification; For real qualitative Mutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons it doth effect; but the <hi>Jus</hi> or Title to any mercy in the world it cannot <hi>Effect,</hi> but <hi>Accept</hi> when offered. If you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſee ſo plain a Truth in its Evidence, yet obſerve by the words of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Brother that is my Opponent in the ſecond Diſputation, and by your Prefacers Dr. <hi>Kendals</hi> courſe that its a paſſive inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality that the Defenders of your cauſe at laſt are driven to; and therefore talk not of <hi>its act of Juſtifying</hi> unleſs you will mean <hi>Gods act of Juſtifying which faith is the Condition of.</hi> And whereas you make <hi>unbelief to be formally a ſlighting and neglecting Chriſt as a Saviour and effectively</hi> (you muſt mean <hi>only</hi> effective &amp; non formaliter) <hi>a denying ſubjection to him
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:60968:172"/>
as Lord.</hi> You err ſo great but ſo rare an error, that I ſuppoſe it needleſs to confute it. All Chriſtians as far as I can learn have been till now agreed, that Believing in Chriſt as Prophet and King is a real part of faith, and that unbelief or rejecting him as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet and King is a real part of unbelief.</p>
                  <p>Your ſecond Argument is from the <hi>different ſubjects;</hi> where you give us two ſuch palpable Fictions, that its a wonder you can make your ſelf believe them, much more that you ſhould lay ſo great a ſtreſs on ſuch abſurdities. The firſt is that the <hi>Act of Faith is in ſeveral faculties:</hi> and you elſwhere give us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that it is <hi>one Phyſical Act</hi> that you mean. And do you think in good ſadneſs that one ſingle Phyſical act can be the act of both the faculties? The ſecond is that <hi>the fear, love and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Chriſt as King is but in the Will.</hi> But <hi>1.</hi> That Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders do you expect, that will take an Aſſertion of <hi>Fear-Love, and Obedience,</hi> in ſtead of an aſſertion concerning <hi>Faith</hi>? Were you not comparing faith in Chriſt as King, with faith in Chriſt as Prieſt only? And why ſpeak you not of faith in one part of your compariſon, as well as in the other? Your concluſion now is nothing to the Queſtion? <hi>2.</hi> Or if you mean that <hi>Faith in Chriſt as King is not in both faculties,</hi> as well as <hi>Faith in Chriſt as Prieſt or ſacrifice,</hi> did you think that any man of ordinary underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing would ever believe you without any proof? or that ever ſuch a thing can be proved?</p>
                  <p>Your third Argument is, <hi>[Becauſe they are in a different time exerted; the one, that is, Faith as Juſtifying being precedane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the other,</hi> (and to other Graces)] <hi>Anſw.</hi> Wonderfull! Is that man juſtified that believeth not in Chriſt as the King and Prophet of the Church? Do you believe this your ſelf? why then an Infidel is juſtified by Faith. The 'Belief in Chriſt as a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice or Prieſt <hi>only,</hi> is not the Chriſtian faith; it is not faith in Chriſt properly, becauſe it is not faith in Chriſt as Chriſt. For Chriſt as Prieſt only is not Chriſt. A <hi>Heart</hi> only is not <hi>Corpus humanum:</hi> A <hi>Body</hi> only is not a <hi>Man;</hi> where there are three eſſential parts, one of them is not the Thing, without the reſt. The name <hi>[Jeſus Chriſt]</hi> ſignifieth the office as well as the perſon. It is eſſential to that Office, that he be Prophet and King. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you ſhew that you do not only <hi>diſtinguiſh</hi> but <hi>divide.</hi> For where
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:60968:172"/>
there is a diſtance of time between the Acts, there is a diviſion. Do you think that we are Chriſts enemies, or followers of them, unleſs we will believe you that a man is Juſtified by Believing in Chriſt only as a Prieſt or Ranſom, or in his Righteouſneſs, before ever be believe in him as King and Lord (and ſo as Teacher, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) If I had ſaid that you are Chriſts enemy for ſuch Doctrine, which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> think you, had had the fairer pretence for his cenſure? But I am far from ſaying ſo, or thinking it. I know that the Aſſent to the eſſential Articles of Chriſtianity, containeth many Acts, and that our Conſent and Affiance are many Phyſical Acts, as the parts of Chriſts Office are many Objects. But yet I (do not <hi>think</hi> but) am <hi>certain</hi> that all theſe phyſical Acts concur to make up that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> which is called Chriſtian, or ſaving, or Juſtifying Faith; and that he that believeth not in Chriſt as to all that is eſſential to Chriſt, is no Chriſtian. And a man is not juſtified by Faith before he is a Chriſtian. And truly Sir, men that are loth to flie from the Light, and that love the Truth, and diligently ſeek it (as heartily, if not as happily as you) muſt yet needs tell you, that if you produce your Mormolucks an hundred times, and cant over and over <hi>[a Papiſt, a Socinian, an Arminian; and an Arminian, a Socinian and a Papiſt]</hi> their underſtandings, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the more be perſwaded to embrace your Deluſions, though you ſhould ſay that the Kingdom of God doth conſiſt in them.</p>
                  <p>Your fourth Argument is that, <hi>[There is a difference in Nature, Efficacy, Energy, and Operation; therefore the Acts are not the ſame.] Anſw 1.</hi> I maintained the concluſion (that faith hath different Acts) before ever I heard of your name; and have no reaſon now to denie it. <hi>2.</hi> The difference of Nature, I grant you between many Acts of faith; but what you mean by the <hi>Efficacy, Energy, and Operation,</hi> be that knows can tell; for I cannot.</p>
                  <p>But ſtill deſire you to know that I deny faith to have any efficient operation in juſtifying us, or that it is an efficient cauſe of our Juſtification; eſpecially its no Phyſical efficient; you add a ſtrange proof of your Aſſertion, <hi>[viz. For faith as Juſtifying makes a myſtical Union and relative change on the perſon; but faith as working and ſanctifying produceth a moral union with Chriſt.</hi> &amp;c.] Anſw. <hi>1.</hi> Faith as juſtifying doth only Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:60968:173"/>
and produce no <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ion; the ſame faith as uniting is the means of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion. <hi>2.</hi> The queſtion is of <hi>[Faith in Chriſt as Prieſt, and faith in Chriſt as Prophet and King alſo.]</hi> And you talk of <hi>[faith as juſtifying, and as working and ſanctifying]</hi> A ſmall alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>3.</hi> What <hi>Myſtical Relative Union</hi> is that which is not a <hi>Moral Union? 4.</hi> Faith in Chriſt as Chriſt, and not as a Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom only, is the means of our Juſtification; And you give us no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like a proof of the contrary reſtriction.</p>
                  <p>In the ſame Preface you tell the world of as threefold Artifice that we uſe; the firſt is <hi>[to ſet up a ſecond Juſtification]</hi> Anſ. Is it the Name or the Thing that you mean? If the name, <hi>1.</hi> cite the words where we uſe that Name. <hi>2.</hi> If it anſwer the ſubject, you may bear with the name. If it be the <hi>Thing,</hi> then tell us what Religion that it that denyeth <hi>1.</hi> a Juſtification by ſentence at Judgement. <hi>2.</hi> Gods continual juſtifying us to the Death. <hi>3.</hi> And his particular pardoning or juſtifying us from the guilt of renewed particular ſins. <hi>4.</hi> And that faith is not only in the firſt act, but through all our lives, the means of our Juſtification; Or, juſtifying faith is more <hi>then</hi> one inſtantaneous Act; or a man ceaſeth not to have juſtifying faith after the firſt Act or moment. Tell us who thoſe be, and what Religion they are of that deny all theſe, that Chriſtians may be acquainted with them, if they be worthy their acquaintance.</p>
                  <p>Our ſecond Artifice is, <hi>[to require Works only as Goſpel-Conditions.] Anſw.</hi> Would you have us ſay <hi>more</hi> of them, or <hi>leſs</hi>? If leſs, I have ſaid enough of it in the ſecond Diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>Our third Artifice is, <hi>[To include works in the Definition of Juſtifying faith, making it a receiving of Chriſt as Saviour, Lord and Law-giver to Juſtification; as alſo confounding our conſummate Salvation or Glorification with our Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.] Anſ.</hi> Groſs untruths! contrary to large and plaine expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of my mind in ſeveral Volumes (if you mean me, as you know I have reaſon to judge) <hi>1.</hi> I ever took works to be a fruit of faith, and no part of it, unleſs you take the word <hi>Faith</hi> improperly and laxely; unleſs by <hi>[Works]</hi> you mean <hi>[Acts]</hi> And you take faith for ſuch a work your ſelf, that is, an <hi>Act. 2.</hi> I expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtiguiſhed what you ſay I confound; Conſummate Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:60968:173"/>
or Glorification, and conſummate Juſtification. But yet as I do in the Definition include <hi>Conſent to Chriſts Lordſhip,</hi> though not <hi>Obedience</hi> (thats only <hi>implyed</hi> to be a neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent,) ſo I ſtill ſay that much of your Juſtitication is yet to come; And if your Religion teach you to ſay, that you will be beholding to Chriſt for no more Juſtification, ſo doth not mine.</p>
                  <p>And whereas you cite ſome that ſay, that all our ſins are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned in our firſt believing, as if I had queſtioned any ſuch thing, I muſt tell you that I eaſily grant it, that every ſin is then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, and ſo far as that Juſtification is perfect; but what have you yet ſaid to prove, <hi>1.</hi> That we are never juſtified be faith, but in that one inſtant. <hi>2.</hi> That we need no particular Juſtification from particular ſins that after ſhall be committed. <hi>3.</hi> Nor no ſentential Juſtification at Judgement, which Mr. <hi>Burgeſs</hi> will tell you, is the chief. You and others uſe to ſay, that, that at Judgement, is but <hi>Declarative.</hi> But <hi>1.</hi> It is no common <hi>Declaration,</hi> but a Declaration by the <hi>Judge. 2.</hi> And the Sentence doth more then meerely declare; for it doth finally decide, acquit and adjudge to Glory. <hi>3.</hi> And methinks this <hi>Declarative</hi> ſhould be no term of Diminution, but of Aggravation, with thoſe that ſtill uſe to ſay that <hi>Juſtification</hi> is a judicial<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Some more I had to ſay to you, but you may find it in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to theſe Diſputations. I only add, that if indeed it be true which you write to that Honourable perſon, to whom you dedicate your Labors, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Subject of your Diſcourſe is ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and neceſſary to be known; and that <hi>He who is Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Object and Office of Faith, doth neither know what he believeth, nor how he is juſtified;</hi> I ſhould think it is high time, that you call your <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding once more to an account, and review the Fabrick that you have built on <hi>a qua juſtificans</hi> not underſtood, or upon a <hi>ſpecificative quate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> where there is no ſuch thing: And if you think me unfit to be hearkned to in this, (as being one of the <hi>men of perverſe minds</hi> that there you mention,) its more worthy your induſtry, to ſeek the advice of the learned Oxford Divines herein, then

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ag. 184. [<hi>All thoſe Scriptures which ſpeak of Juſtification as done in this life, I underſtand of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in Title of Law. So Rom.</hi> 5.1. and 4 2. and 5.9. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.21, 25, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] I conceive Juſtification, being Gods Act, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.30. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33. conſequent upon Faith, and calling, and importing a ſentence oppoſite to Condemnation; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30, 33, 34. and 5.1. terminated on particular perſons, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.2, 3 <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. it muſt be more then the Vertual Juſtification in Law-Title; which is only an act of God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing or promiſig a way of Juſtification, not the ſentence it ſelf, and is general, and indeterminate to particular perſons, and is performed before the perſon juſtified believes: Yea is the ſame, though none were actually juſtified: and therefore in my apprehenſion, that Act of Gods Covenanting or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing, in which I conceive you place the Juſtification by Law-Title. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 38. Is not the Juſtification by faith meant, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides, to be juſtified notes a Paſſion, which preſuppoſeth an Action; an Act Tranſient, not Immanent; or only Gods purpoſe to juſtifie: nor can it be Gods Promiſe to juſtifie:
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:60968:177"/>
For the Act, though it be Tranſient, yet it is only a Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what he will do; his promiſe to juſtifie upon condition, is not Juſtifying, and therefore a man is not by the Covenant, without a further Act, Denominated Juſtified, though he be made juſtifyable by it. I conceive Juſtification is a Court term, Importing an Act of God as Judge, whereas his promiſing is not his Act as Judge, but <hi>Rector, theſ.</hi> 42. you mention the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels judging us Righteous, and Rejoycing therein; which whence it ſhould be, but by a ſentence paſſed in Heaven, I know not. Conſtitutive Juſtification, different from Declarative by ſentence, I do not find expreſſed under the term <hi>[Juſtification]</hi> It would be conſidered whether any other Act beſides the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, doth make a man juſt, but giving of faith; notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſts Death, and the conditional Covenant before faith, a perſon is only juſtifyable; <hi>Conditionalis nihil ponit in eſſe.</hi> A per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is upon giving of Faith juſtified; but not by giving of faith (thats an act of Sanctification) but by a ſentence of God, <hi>Theſ.</hi> 59. You make juſtification a continued act; now it being a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient act, I ſuppoſe it may not be well called a continued Act, which imports a ſucceſſive motion between the <hi>terminus a quo,</hi> and <hi>terminus ad quem</hi>; whereas the act, whether by ſentence, or Covenant, is not ſuch a Motion. Its not to be denyed, that the Benefit and Vertue of it is continued, but I think not the Act. If it be not <hi>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>mel,</hi> but <hi>ſaepe,</hi> yet it ſhould be rather called <hi>Actus Renovatus, Repetitus, Iteratus,</hi> then continued I incline to think there is but one Juſtification of a perſon in this life, though there be frequent remiſſions of ſin. Of this you may Conſider.</p>
                  <p>In the Saints <hi>Everlaſting Reſt, pag.</hi> 11. Doubtleſs the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel takes faith for our obedience to All Goſpel Precepts. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving doth not produce ſubjection to Chriſt as King, as a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, but contains it as an Eſſential part, <hi>&amp;c. Aphor. p.</hi> 25.5. Faith doth as Really and Immediately Receive Chriſt as King (as Saviour, or Prieſt) and ſo Juſtifie, <hi>Theſ.</hi> 65. Scripture doth not take the word <hi>[Faith]</hi> for any one ſingle Act; nor yet for various Acts of one only faculty; but for a compleat en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire motion of the whole ſoul to Chriſt its Object, <hi>Theſ.</hi> 57. It is the Act of faith which juſtifies men at Age, and not the Habit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="327" facs="tcp:60968:177"/>Againſt this I object; 1. <hi>Faith worketh by Love,</hi> Gal. 5.16. If one be an eſſential part of the other, and faith a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat entire motion of the ſoul, then when it is ſaid, Faith work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by Love, it might be ſaid, it worketh by Faith.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Goſpel Precepts are many, if not all, the ſame with the Moral Law; if Juſtified then by obedience to them, are we not juſtified by the works of the Law? You conceive the Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. to be by works in a proper ſence, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God; and <hi>Rahabs</hi> act was a work of Hoſpitality, <hi>ver.</hi> 25. commanded in the Law; and <hi>Abrahams</hi> work was a ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, or offering a work of the Ceremonial Law, <hi>ver.</hi> 21.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Repentance is obedience to one Goſpel Precept, yet Faith and Repentance are diſtinguiſhed, <hi>Mar.</hi> 1.15.6, 1. <hi>Love, Faith, Hope, are three,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.13. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.3. faith and Love have different Objects, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Phil.</hi> 5. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. Therefore not the ſame; nor one an Eſſential part of the other.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Obedience is a ſign to prove faith, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.18. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not an Eſſential part.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. If Faith include obedience to all Goſpel Precepts as an Eſſential part, then actual faith includes actual obedience to all Goſpel Precepts as an eſſential part; and if the Act of faith Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie men at Age, not the Habit; and receiving Chriſt as King, as immediatly Juſtifie, as believing in Chriſt as Saviour, then a perſon of Age is not Juſtified without actual obedience to all Goſpel Precepts, and this may be not till Death; if then, and ſo, no Juſtification in this Life.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. If Faith juſtifie as immediatly by receiving Chriſt as King, as by receiving him as Saviour, then it juſtifies by receiving Chriſt as Judge, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.34. as Law-giver, Avenger of his enemies, and ſo a man is juſtified By receiving Chriſts Judging, Puniſhing, Condemning, Commanding, Avenging, as well as ſaving by his Death; which is contrary to <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. &amp; 5.9</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The Scripture makes the object of juſtifying faith Chriſts Death, Reſurrection, Blood, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. &amp; 10.9. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20, 21. Nowhere Chriſts dominion. <hi>Ergo.</hi> Subjection to Chriſt as King is not an eſſential part.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The object of Faith is nowhere made to be a Goſpel

Precept, ſuch as forgiving others, uſing Sacraments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nor Chriſt as commanding; but the Declaration of the Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments of Chriſt, and the counſel of God in him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.1. <hi>&amp;c. Rom.</hi> 1 16, 17. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Ergo</hi> Obedience is not an Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential part.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. If it be an eſſential part, then either Genus or Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; for no other Eſſential parts belong to a quality or Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: not the Genus, that's Aſſent. <hi>Aph. p.</hi> 254.274. when the object is a Propoſition: when it is an Incomplex term, Truſt is the Genus: not the Difference, thats chiefly taken from the object. <hi>Keker. ſyſt.

Obedience may make known Faith as a ſign, but not as a part, its at leaſt in order of Nature after; the cauſe is afore the effect: the Antecedent before the Conſequent; and faith is ſuch, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.8. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. If Faith be a compleat entire motion of the whole ſoul to Chriſt, then it ſhould be Love, Joy, Hope, Underſtanding, Will, Memory, Fear; But this is not to be ſaid. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is alleadged, 1. Faith muſt be the Act of the whole ſoul; elſe part ſhould receive him, part not.</p>

The whole ſoul receives Chriſt, though by other Graces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides faith.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Acts</hi> 8.37 <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.10. <hi>Anſw.</hi> The term <hi>[Whole]</hi> notes not every inward faculty; but (as after) ſincerely, not feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, as <hi>Simon Magus.</hi> So <hi>Illyricus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Faith is called Obeying the Goſpel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.16. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.22. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4.17. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5.7. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw. Heb.</hi> 5.9. ſpeaks of obeyng Chriſt, but doth not call faith obeying Chriſt: but be it granted, Faith is called obeying of Chriſt, or the Goſpel; doth it follow that it is obedience in doing thoſe named Acts? It may be obedience by Aſſent to

the Doctrine of Chriſt, that he is the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> died for ſins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> commanded 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.3. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.23. which the terms <gap reason="foreign">

                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The fulfilling the condition of the new Covenant is called faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.12, 23, 25.</p>

                  <p>BEſides what hath been formerly ſuggeſted to you, theſe words in your Scripture proofs, <hi>pag.</hi> 323. <hi>And where he next ſaith, that in the aged ſeveral diſpoſitions are required to fit a man to receive pardon, (and ſo juſtification)</hi> viz <hi>Catholike faith, hope of pardon, fear of puniſhment, grief for ſin, a purpoſe againſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hereafter, and a purpoſe of a new life, all which diſpoſe the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver; and I agree to him, though all do not</hi>] are ſo like the Doctrine of the Trent Council. ſeſſ. 6. <hi>c.</hi> 6. that it will be expected you declare, whether by avowing that ſpeech of Dr. <hi>Ward,</hi> you do not join with the Papiſts, contrary to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Downam</hi> of Juſtification. <hi>l.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 7. §. 1.2. Mr. <hi>Pemble vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict. fidei.</hi> §. 2. <hi>c.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>And when you make Juſtification a continued Act upon condition of obedience, its to be conſidered how you will avoid <hi>Tompſons</hi> opinion of the Intercifion of Juſtification, upon the committing of a ſin that waſts the conſcience, refuted by Dr. <hi>Rob. Abbot.</hi> but vented after by <hi>Moutague</hi> in his appeal, and oppoſed by Dr. <hi>Preſton,</hi> and others.</p>
                  <p>As for Juſtification by Law-Title, by the Covenant upon actual Believing, without any other act of God, conſequent on Faith; if it were ſo; 1. Then it ſhould be by neceſſary Reſultancy; But Juſtification is an Act of Will, and no act of Will is by neceſſary Reſultancy.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If the Covenant juſtifie without any other Act of God, then it Adops, Glorifies, Sanctifies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without any other Act, which is not to be ſaid. The reaſon of the Sequel is, becauſe the Covenant of it ſelf doth in the ſame manner produce the one as well as the other.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Juſtification of the Covenant is only conditional, therefore not Actual; Actual Juſtification is not till Faith be put: and then <hi>Poſit â conditione,</hi> it is Actual: A conditional, is only a poſſible Juſtification; its only <hi>in potentia,</hi> till the Condition be in act; Now the Covenant doth only aſſure it on condition, as a future thing, not therefore as actual, or preſent.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="332" facs="tcp:60968:180"/>4 The Covenant is an Act paſt, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.7, 8. ſo not continued; and conſequently, the Juſtification barely by it, without any other Act, muſt be paſt long ſince, and not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued; and he neither Juſtification Actual, and in purpopſe; or virtual, will be confounded, or an effect ſhall be continued, without the cauſe.</p>

                  <p>I AM more thankfull to you for theſe free, candid, rational Animadverſions, then I can now expreſs to you: yet being ſtill conſtrained to diſſent from you, by the evidence of Truth, I give you theſe Reaſons of my diſſent.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt, You think that <hi>[the Scriptures cited, are not to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tepreted of Juſtification in Title of Law, becauſe this is only an Act of God preſcribing or promiſing a way of Juſtification; not the Sentence it ſelf; and is general, and indeterminate to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſons, &amp;c.]</hi> To which I anſwer. 1. That I am paſt doubt that you build all this on a great miſtake about the nature of Gods Law or Covenant, &amp; Promiſe, &amp; the moral action thereof. For you muſt know that this Promiſe of God, 1. is not a bare <hi>Aſſertio explicans de futuro animum qui nunc eſt</hi>; (as <hi>Grotius</hi> ſpeaks:) Nor yet that which he calleth <hi>Pollicitatio, cum voluntas ſeipſam pro futuro tempore determinat, cum ſigno ſufficientè ad judicandam perſeverandi neceſſitatem.</hi> But it is <hi>Perfecta Promiſſio, ubi ad determinationem talem accedit ſignum volendi jus proprium alteri conferre, quae ſimilem babet effectum qualem alienatio Domin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">2. This Promiſe or Covenant of God, is alſo his <hi>Teſtament</hi>: and who knoweth not that a <hi>Teſtament</hi> is an <hi>Inſtrctment</hi> of proper <hi>Donation,</hi> and not only a <hi>Prediction?</hi> 3. Moreover this ſame which in one reſpect is a Covenant and Promiſe, and in another a Teſtament, is alſo truly part of Gods Law, even the New <hi>conſtitution</hi> of Chriſt, the Law-giver and King. But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ndoubtedly a Law which conferreth. Right either abſolutely
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:60968:180"/>
or conditionally, is the true and proper Inſtrument of that Effect, and not only <hi>[the preſenting or promiſing away thereto]</hi> The proper Effect or Product of every Law, is <hi>Debitum ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quod; Et de hoc debito determinare</hi> is its proper Act. Now therefore this Promiſe being part of Chriſts Law, doth <hi>deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> of and confer on us, the <hi>Debitum,</hi> or <hi>Right</hi> to ſententi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Juſtification, having firſt given us an Intereſt in Chriſt, and ſo to the Benefit of his ſatisfaction; and this is <hi>Juſtificatio conſtitutiva.</hi> You know a Deed of Gift (though but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional) is a moſt proper Inſtrument of conferring the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits therein contained. And is not the Promiſe undoubtedly Gods Deed of Gift? And doth he not thereby make over, as it were under his hand, the Lord Jeſus, and all his Benefits to them that will receive him? So that when you ſay, that <hi>[his Promiſe to juſtifie upon condition, is not juſtifying]</hi> You may ſee it is otherwiſe by all the forementioned conſiderations of the nature of the Promiſe. You may as well ſay, a <hi>Teſtament,</hi> or <hi>deed of Gift conditional, doth not give,</hi> or a <hi>Law doth not confer Right and Title.</hi> And in theſe Relative benefits, to give Right to the thing, and to give the thing it ſelf, or right in it, is all one: (ſtill allowing the diſtance of time limited for both in the Inſtrument) It is all one to give full right to ſon-ſhip, and to make one a Son: or at leaſt they are inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. Yea, (which weigheth moſt of all with me) it being the proper work of Gods Laws to <hi>give Duneſs</hi> of, or <hi>Right to Benefits,</hi> it cannot be any other way accompliſhed that is within our Knowledge (I think) For <hi>Decree, Purpoſe,</hi> and ſo Predeſtination cannot do it, they being <hi>Determinations de eventu,</hi> and not <hi>de debito,</hi> as ſuch: And the <hi>ſentential decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> preſuppoſeth this <hi>Debitum,</hi> or <hi>true Righteouſneſs</hi> an therefore doth not give it. No wonder therefore while you deny this Legal, Teſtamentary, Moral Donation, that you are forced alſo to deny <hi>Juſtification conſtitutive</hi>; (but very inconveniently and unſafely.) By what way doth God give a father Authority over his Children, and a Husband over his Wife, and a Magiſtrate over the people, and a Miniſter over the Church or Flock, but only by this Moral Legal Action? And even ſo doth he give Power to them that receive him, to
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:60968:181"/>
become his Sons. And it is the ſame Inſtrument which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth this, which is called a Promiſe, Covenant, Teſtament, Diſpoſition or Law; the name being taken from different re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects or accidental conſiderations.</p>
                  <p>Again, If the word of Chriſt do judge us, then that word doth juſtifie and condemn: (For judging in general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth theſe ſpecial Actions.) But the word doth judge us, (and ſhall do at the laſt day:) therefore the word doth juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and condemn.</p>
                  <p>Again: It is a Rule in the Civil Law (as <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lpian</hi>) that <hi>By the ſame way as an Obligation is induced or cauſed, it muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved or deſtroyed:</hi> But by the curſe of the Law, or the Threatning of Penalty, was our obligation to puniſhment, and condemnation induced or cauſed: therefore by the way of Law diſſolving that cauſe, muſt it be taken off. Now as <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus eſt obligatio ad Poenam,</hi> ſo pardon is the diſſolving of that <hi>Obligation,</hi> or diſcharge from it; <hi>(Venia &amp; Poena ſunt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſa:)</hi> And therefore the Law of Chriſt, or this his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe or Grant, is the Inſtrument of Pardoning. And me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, when you are convinced, that God pardoneth by Law or moral Action, you ſhould eaſily yield, that in the like way he <hi>juſtifieth.</hi> For if you be not of the Judgement, that Remiſſion and Juſtification are all one: yet you muſt needs yield, that they are of ſo near a nature, that the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is exceeding ſmall, and rather notional and reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, then real. I might to theſe Arguments add ſomewhat from the Iſſue, and different tendency of this my opinion and the contrary. As that this doth give Gods Laws their honor and dignity, by aſcribing to them that higher and more noble and effective Action; which the contrary opinion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying it, doth very injuriouſly debaſe the Scriptures or Laws of God. Alſo that this opinion is the only expedient left, (that I can find) to avoid the <hi>Antinomian</hi> fancy of an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Juſtification, which all they muſt aſſert, that ſay it is an Immanent Act (which you juſtly and truly deny.) For your way lying in the other extream, 1. Overthroweth all <hi>conſtitutive Juſtification</hi>; which is not to be born. (Whether <hi>All Pardon</hi> by the Covenant, I yet know not your mind)</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="335" facs="tcp:60968:181"/>2. And it Intepreteth all Scriptures (that ſpeak of a Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in this life) of a ſtrange feigned Juſtification, which for ought I find hath no ground in Scripture at all; and is wholly aliene to our condition; and at leaſt utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to us, if not known to be untrue. What doth it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern a ſinner to be juſtified or condemned now before a Court of Angels, where he is not preſent, nor knows any thing of it? nor do we know what Angels have to do in ſuch a buſineſs. And what Tranſient Act is it that God then and there puts forth or performeth? Can you tell? or doth Scripture tell you? God ſpeaketh not to Angels by voyce. If you think (as the Schoolmen, ſome) that they ſee our Juſtification, as other things in the face of God; then it is no Tranſient Act. Elſe why may not they ſee it in it ſelf? And then either our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is Gods Eſſence, and they ſee it in him as his Eternal Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or elſe God muſt be mutable, as having ſomething to be ſeen in him <hi>de novo,</hi> which was not in him from Eternity. If you ſay that this Tranſient Act is Gods Illuminating the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical underſtanding to know us to be juſtified; then this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth that we are juſtified already by ſome former Act (which can be nothing that I know but the moral Act of his Lawes:) For their knowing us to be juſtified is not a juſtifying us, but preſuppoſeth us to be what they know us to be. I can think of nothing elſe that you can ſay, except this, that Chriſt as man may Vocally (or by ſome equivalent Tranſient Act) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce us Juſtified, as he will do at Judgement. But 1. this is without Scripture. 2. and it is God that juſtifieth. 3. And then how were all the faithful juſtified before Chriſts Incarnation and Aſcenſion? Or do you think none were juſtified before?</p>
                  <p>But I will return to your Exceptions.</p>
                  <p>You ſay, <hi>[This is but Virtual Juſtification]</hi> which is in Law Title. <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It is <hi>Actual Conſtitutive Juſtification,</hi> and not <hi>Virtual</hi> only 2. But it is indeed but <hi>Virtual ſentential</hi> juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But yet it is of the higheſt kind of Virtuality. It is that which makes us <hi>rectos in curia,</hi> (which I take to be the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of our Juſtification in this life.) And taken <hi>diviſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi> it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth more excellent in ſome reſpect, then the ſentence or decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration it ſelf; for he that by Purchaſe firſt, and Pardon (writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten)
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:60968:182"/>
after, maketh Offenders juſt in Law,) <hi>i. e. (non obligatos ad poenam,)</hi> ſeemeth to do more for them by that act, then after by pronouncing them juſt. Though yet this laſt I know is the moſt perfect Juſtification, taken <hi>conjunctim</hi> with the reſt, as the end to which they tend, and as that which giveth them their full effect.</p>
                  <p>Your next Objection is, that this Goſpel Juſtification, <hi>[is general and indeterminate to particular perſons]</hi> Anſwer. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be more certain or effectual. For when it is to all, no man hath reaſon to think himſelf excepted (who excludes not himſelf by non-performance of the conditions.) Every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular man is comprized in All. And for the determination, the <hi>Deſcription</hi> of the perſon is as certain a way as the <hi>naming</hi> of him. To give Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs <hi>to All that will receive him,</hi> is as effectual a determinate Gift to each particular Receiver, as to give him to <hi>Peter, Paul, John</hi> by name. If a Pardon be proclaimed, or given in the Laws, to all Offenders that perform ſuch a condition; is it not as ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual to each perſon, as if he were named? If a Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath ſuch Lands or Monies to all his Children (or a man to all the poor in the town) on condition that they come by ſuch a day to ſuch a place, and ſignifie their acceptance and gratitude: is not this as ſure and good, as if they were all named?</p>
                  <p>Next, You object, <hi>[This is performed, before the perſon juſtified believes.]</hi> Anſwer. I have ſaid enough to you of this already. (of Bapt. <hi>pag.</hi> 100.) I add this much: you muſt diſtinguiſh between the Phyſical act of making this Law, Promiſe, Covenant, Grant or Teſtament: and the Moral Agency of this Law, Grant or Teſtament once made. The former was before we Believed: but the later was not (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and fully) till after. Do not all Philoſophers and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines in the world that meddle with it, tell you that this is uſual with moral cauſes, that they may have all their abſolute Entity and <hi>vim agendi,</hi> long before they produe their effects? and may be <hi>Actu primo, etſi non ſecundo effectum producente,</hi> in being long before. The Law that determineth of your right to your Poſſeſſion, or that doth give a Reward to every man
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:60968:182"/>
that killeth a wild hurtfull beaſt, or that condemneth every man that murdereth or committeth Felony, &amp;c. was in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before thoſe perſons were born perhaps: And yet it did not <hi>hoc agere</hi>; it did not <hi>Praemiare, Punire, Praecipere, &amp;c.</hi> as to this man before. A pardon from a Prince to a Traytor, on condition, doth not perform the moral act of his diſcharge, till he perform the condition, though it were in being before. The like I may ſay of a Teſtament or Deed of Gift: But what need many words in a caſe where the Truth is ſo obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous? If ſome moral cauſes may be cauſes, and <hi>Agere mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter,</hi> or produce their effects, even before they are naturally in Being, much more may they ſuſpend it, and ſo produce it long after they are in Being: <hi>Cauſae enim moralis ea ratio eſt, ut etiam cum non eſt actu, ſit efficax, modò habe at (ut loquun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur in ſcholis) eſſe cognitums: inquit</hi> Rivetus <hi>Diſput.</hi> 13. <hi>de ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fact. Chriſti.</hi> pag. 282.</p>
                  <p>Next you ſay, <hi>[Yea it is the ſame, though none were actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally juſtified.]</hi> Anſwer. This requires no other anſwer, then what is given to the former. It is the ſame <hi>Phyſice conſiderata, vel in Entitate naturali:</hi> But the moral action of pardoning and juſtifying is not the ſame, nor <hi>is</hi> at all: A <hi>conditional Pardon,</hi> Deed of Gift, Teſtament, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> doth not at all <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> or <hi>Give,</hi> till you perform the condition. For it is the proper nature of a <hi>condition</hi> to ſuſpend the act of the Grant: ſo that till it be abſolute or equal to Abſolute, it is not <hi>Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> Remiſſion, Juſtification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) The reaſon of all this is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe Laws, Teſtaments or Promiſes, are but the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers, Teſtators or Donors Inſtruments, and therefore act when and how he pleaſes: and it is his pleaſure that they ſhould act no otherwiſe then as is aforeſaid, and as in the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of them he ſhall expreſs.</p>
                  <p>Next you add <hi>[To be juſtified, notes a paſſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſeth an Action tranſient, not immanent, or only Gods purpoſe to juſtifie:]</hi> Anſwer 1. So far as the Reception of a Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be called a Paſſion, this is true: And no doubt you are in the right, that it is not <hi>Actus immanens.</hi> But now, <hi>What tranſient Act</hi> it is, I remember very few Divines that once tell us; but only in general ſay, <hi>It is a Tranſient Act.</hi>
                     <pb n="338" facs="tcp:60968:183"/>
Now you and I that have adventured to enquire, do happen to be both ſingular from others, and differing between our ſelves, (only Mr. <hi>Rutherford,</hi> and ſome few others I find ſaying oft, that we are pardoned and juſtified by the Goſpel: by which they ſeem to mean as I) But for your way of Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by a ſentence before the Angels, as I never met with any that judged that to be our Juſtification by Faith, ſo as I have ſaid, it ſeems to me very groundleſs and ſtrange. And then, if yours ſtand not, mine only muſt, for any thing that is yet diſcovered, that I have ſeen, for I know of none that tells us of any third,</p>
                  <p>Your next Objection is the ſame before anſwered, that <hi>[Gods Promiſe to juſtifie, is only a declaration what he will do, and therefore a man is not by Covenant without a further Act juſtified, but juſtifiable.]</hi> Anſwer. <hi>Grotius de ſatisfact.</hi> will tell you, that Promiſes give right to him to whom they are made: and that therefore they cannot be reclaimed, though threatnings may. But if theſe were only Promiſes that God will by another Act do this or that for us, then it were to the purpoſe that you ſay: but that you cannot prove. Nor needs there any other Act, but the moral Action of the Inſtrument it ſelf to change our Relations here: <hi>Et fruſtra fit pro plura, &amp;c.</hi> Indeed an Act of ours <hi>[Believing]</hi> muſt come in before the effect: but you and I are agreed, that this is but conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal, and not effective. Theſe Promiſes therefore being alſo Gods Law, Teſtament (of Chriſt) Deed of Gift, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they do not only foretell an Event to come to paſs by ſome other Action; but they do confer a Right or make due the benefit or relation, and ſo effect it; only the Author is pleaſed to ſuſpend the effect of his Inſtrument, till we perform the Condition. As if by a Leaſe, or Deed of Sale, there be ſome Office or Dignity made over to you: or ſome command in Army or Court, or Country: or by a Law a Foraigner be Naturalized or Enfranchized, on ſuch or ſuch a Condition; This Leaſe or Deed, or Law doth not only foretel, but effect the thing.</p>
                  <p>You add that <hi>[Juſtification is a Court-term, importing an Act of God as Judge, whereas his promiſing is not his Act as
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:60968:183"/>
Judge, but Rector.]</hi> Anſwer 1. If by a Court-term, you alſo mean a <hi>Law-term,</hi> (<hi>verbum forenſe</hi> or <hi>judiciarium</hi> in the full ſenſe) I agree with you. But if you confine it to the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence as pronounced, I require Proof; as alſo proof of any ſuch ſentence before Judgement, particular or general. A Rector is either <hi>Supremus</hi> or <hi>Subaliernus:</hi> A Judge is either <hi>ſupreme above all Laws,</hi> as being the Law-giver, or <hi>ſub lege.</hi> God is both <hi>Rector</hi> and <hi>Judge,</hi> only in the firſt ſenſes: and by <hi>judging,</hi> he <hi>Ruleth</hi>; and <hi>Rector</hi> is but the <hi>Genus,</hi> whereof <hi>Judex</hi> is a <hi>ſpecies.</hi> As <hi>Rector ſupremus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> God is the <hi>Legiſlator,</hi> and ſo acteth (and juſtifieth by his Laws, Grants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) as Judge he ſentenceth and abſolveth thoſe that were firſt made juſt. A man is accuſed for killing another in fight, at the command of the Soveraign Power. Is it not as fit and proper a ſaying, to ſay <hi>[The Law doth juſtifie this man for ſo doing againſt all Accuſers,]</hi> as to ſay, <hi>[The Judge will juſtifie him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>]</hi> Nay, Is it not more ordinary? And in a ſort, the Supream or Soveraign may be ſaid to be (though in a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſenſe) juſtified, as well as an <hi>Inferior</hi>; when yet the ſaid perſon in Supremacy hath no Judge, nor is to have any by Law, and ſo cannot be juſtified by ſentence. God will be <hi>juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi> in his ſayings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as he hath in a ſort bound himſelf by his own Laws, that is, ſignified his Reſolution to obſerve them; ſo in the ſenſe of theſe Laws, his works are now juſt, and ſhall be hereafter ſo be manifeſted: but not by any ſentence of a Superior. But this I confeſs differeth from our Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Next you ſay, <hi>[You know not whence it ſhould be that Angels ſhould judge us righteous, and rejoice therein, but by a ſentence paſſed in Heaven.]</hi> Anſwer. If you think (and prove) that Angels cannot know us to be righteous, then I will not affirm that they judge us ſo. For I preſuppoſe that that they know us to be ſo made by ſome Act before, and therefore they judge us to be as we are. And if they may know that we are Believers, and know that the New Law juſtifieth all ſuch, then they may judge us to be juſtified without any ſentence in Heaven, even as they know when a ſinner is converted, and rejoice in it; which doubtleſs they may know without a ſentence in
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:60968:184"/>
Heaven pronouncing us converted; and Gods making them Inſtruments in conferring his Mercies may make them know.</p>
                  <p>You ſay that [<hi>Conſtitutive Juſtification, different from De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarative by ſentence, I do not find expreſſed under the term</hi> (Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification:) <hi>it would be conſidered, whether any other Act be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the ſentence, doth make a man juſt, but giving of faith.</hi>] <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Theſe two things I ſhall prove to convince you: (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this is of ſome moment.) 1. That ſome Act there muſt be to conſtitute us juſt, before or beſides the ſentence. 2. That neither the ſentence nor the giving of Faith doth firſt and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly conſtitute us Juſt.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If we be not juſt before we are judged as juſt, then Gods Judgement ſhould not be according to Truth. But Gods Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is according to Truth: therefore we are juſt before we are ſo judged. 2. He that hath Chriſt, and the Benefits of his ſatiſfactory Righteouſneſs given him by the New Law, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, Teſtament or Grant of Chriſt, is hereby conſtituted righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous. But every Believer hath Chriſt and the ſaid benefits Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him in and by the Law or Covenant: therefore he is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by made or conſtituted Righteous.</p>
                  <p>And here by the way take notice, that the New Law or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant hath two Offices; the one to <hi>Beſtow Right</hi> to the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit: and hereby it <hi>makes Righteous</hi>: The other to <hi>Declare</hi> and <hi>manifeſt</hi> openly, and to be the <hi>Rule of publique Judgement:</hi> and ſo it doth both <hi>actione morali proclaim</hi> believers righteous, and <hi>Virtually</hi> ſentence them ſo. And therefore in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.5. it is called <hi>[the Righteouſneſs which is of the Law]</hi> And if the Old Law had a power of making Righteous, if man could have performed the condition, ſo alſo hath the New.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And that the <hi>ſentence</hi> doth not <hi>conſtitute</hi> us Juſt, needs no proof: It is the work of a <hi>Judge</hi> by <hi>ſentence</hi> to <hi>clear</hi> the Guiltleſs, and not to <hi>make</hi> them Guiltleſs. Pardon indeed may do ſomewhat to it: but that is not the action of a Judge as a Judge, but (as you before diſtinguiſhed) of a <hi>Rector</hi> (in caſe of tranſgreſſing Lawes.) A Judge pronounceth men to be what they firſt are according to Law; and not <hi>makes</hi> them to be righteous who are not. <hi>He that ſaith to the wicked, thou art
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:60968:184"/>
Righteous, Nations ſhall curſe him; people ſhall bhor him</hi>: Pro. 24.24. <hi>He that juſtifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the Juſt, even they both are abomination to the Lord,</hi> Prov. 17.15. If this were not ſo, then we muſt believe that no man is juſtified before the day of (particular or general) Judgement, till you have proved that God ſentenceth at a Court of Angels.</p>
                  <p>And that the <hi>Giving of Faith</hi> doth not make Righteous (that is, according to the Law of works) <hi>effective,</hi> I think you confeſs. If I thought you did not, it were very eaſily proved: Faith being but the condition of our univerſal righteouſneſs (which the old Law requireth in its ſtead) cannot be that Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs it ſelf: and ſome other efficient there muſt be of our Juſtification here.</p>
                  <p>Next you ſay <hi>[Notwithſtanding Chriſts Death and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Covenant afore faith, a perſon is only juſtifyable: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionalis nihil ponit eſſe.] Anſw.</hi> All this is very true: but not any thing againſt me. I like well what you ſay of Chriſts death, becauſe it is (as <hi>Aquinas</hi> and our <hi>Davenant, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher,</hi> &amp;c. ſay,) but <hi>Cauſa univerſalis, vel Remedium omnibus applicabile.</hi> It is to prepare for and merit, &amp; not <hi>directly</hi> to <hi>effect</hi> our Juſtification, (whatſoever the <hi>Antinomians</hi> dream:) But the Covenant or Teſtament is the very efficient Inſtrumental cauſe of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and its Action is Gods Action. Yet its true that <hi>Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionalis nihil ponit in eſſe:</hi> that is, till the condition be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but then it becometh of equal force to an Abſolute Gift and doth <hi>ponere in eſſe</hi>: even the ſame Inſtrument doth it, whoſe Action till then was (by the Authors will) ſuſpended.</p>
                  <div type="part">
                     <p>YOu next paſs to another Point (about <hi>Theſ.</hi> 59.) whether Juſtification be a continued Act. And you ſay that [<hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Tranſient Act, it cannot be well called a continued Act, which imports a ſucceſſive motion between the</hi> Terminus a quo <hi>and</hi> ad quem, <hi>whereas this Act, whether by ſentence or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, is not ſuch a motion,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. All this may be true of a proper natural Action: but you know that it is only a moral Action which I affirm to be continued, and of this you know your Rule <hi>de motu</hi> holds not, except you take <hi>Motus</hi>
                        <pb n="342" facs="tcp:60968:185"/>
largely and improperly. As paſſive Juſtification, or the effect of the Juſtifying Act is but a Relation, which is the weakeſt of Entities; ſo doth it <hi>per nudam reſultantiam</hi> ariſe, which is by <hi>the</hi> weakeſt of Cauſalities; The Act of God giving out and enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Law or Covenant at firſt, was indeed a proper tranſient Act, and is ceaſed: but the moral Action of the Law thus ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted is <hi>continual.</hi> The Law of the land, which condemneth Delinquents, and juſtifieth the obedient, doth both by a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued moral Act. The Leaſe of your Houſe or Lands gives you Title thereto by a continued moral Act. So that this which I aſſert, is not <hi>Actus repetitus vel renovatus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You add that <hi>[You incline to think that there is but one Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification of a Perſon in this life, though frequent Remiſſion of ſin.] Anſw.</hi> In that you judge as moſt of the Orthodox do: And I have ſaid nothing to the contrary. I think alſo, that as Scripture uſeth the phraſe of oft-forgiving, but ſeldom of oft-juſtifying, ſo it is ſafeſt to ſpeak as Scripture doth. Yet as to the <hi>thing,</hi> me thinks, that as Remiſſion and Juſtification do but reſpectively or very narrowly differ; ſo in this caſe, one may as truly be ſaid to be repeated, as the other: that is, As there is an univerſal Remiſſion of all ſin paſt, upon our firſt true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving; which univerſal Remiſſion is never iterated, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued: ſo is there an Univerſal Juſtification of the perſon at the ſame time, by which he is made juſt, (and in Law ſo eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, pronounced or judged) by being acquit from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning Power of the Law, which (for his ſins paſt only) was before in force againſt him. And ſo if you look to ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion or Juſtification as wholly changeth the ſtate of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, making him Pardoned who was before wholly unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and fully under guilt of all former ſins; or making him ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified who was before unjuſtified, and condemned (in Law;) neither of theſe I think, are iterated. But then, as you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs a frequently renewed pardon for following ſins, ſo I know no reaſon, but in the ſame ſence there muſt be a frequent Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying: For as our Divines well conclude, that ſin cannot be pardoned before it be committed (for then there ſhould be pardon without Guilt; for no man is Guilty of ſin to come formally;) ſo is it as neceſſary to conclude, that no man is ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:60968:185"/>
from ſin before it be committed; that is, from that which is not; and ſo is not ſin: For then Juſtification ſhould go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and without Legal Accuſation and Condemnation: For the Law accuſeth and condemneth no man for a ſin which is not committed, and ſo is no ſin. It is ſaid <hi>Acts</hi> 13.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>aw, to ſhew it is an Act of the Law (though ſin maketh tranſgreſſors unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable.) ſo you ſee it is a Scripture phraſe to ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we are <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied from ſin</hi>: And then either there muſt be ſome kind of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Juſtification from particular ſins after faith, of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of our renewed particular Pardon; or elſe what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of us for them? For ſure if the Law be ſo far in force againſt the actions of Believers as to make and conclude them Guilty and Obliged to Puniſhment (as much as in it lyeth) and ſo to need a frequent <hi>pardon</hi> (for pardon is a diſcharge from Guilt, which is an Obligation to puniſhment;) then it muſt needs be in force to Judge them worthy condemnation, and ſo to Accuſe (and as much as in it lyeſ to condemn) them; and ſo they muſt need alſo a particular Juſtification. But then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my Judgement, 1. There is a ſure Ground ſaid of both in the Goſpel or new Law or Covenant. 2. And the ſaid New Law doth perform it, by the ſame Power by which it did univerſally juſtifie and pardon them at the firſt. There needeth no addition to the Law.

                     <p>And here let me ask you one Queſtion, which I forgot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore about the firſt Point. Seeing you think (truly) that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don is iterated as oft as we ſin, by what Tranſient Act of God is this done? Doth God every moment at a Court of Angels Declare each ſinner in the world, remitted of his particular ſin? (for every moment we commit them.) If you once-ſee a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of judging the New Covenant or Promiſe Gods <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning Inſtrument,</hi> I doubt not but you will ſoon acknowledge as much about <hi>Juſtification.</hi> And ſure a Legal or written In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument is ſo proper for this work, that we uſe to call it <hi>[A Pardon,]</hi> which a Prince writes for the acquitting of an offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, the Goſpel daily juſtifieth by continuing our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, as your Leaſe ſtill giveth you Title to your Land.</p>

                     <p>THe next Point you come to about the Nature and Object of Faith, you are larger upon, through a miſtake of my words and meaning. I know not therefore how to Anſwer your Arguments till I have firſt told you my ſence, and better ſtated the Queſtion.</p>
                     <p>Indeed that in <hi>pag.</hi> 11. of Reſt, I apprehended my ſelf, ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to miſconſtruction, that I have corrected it in the ſecond Edition (which is now printed.) Yet 1. I ſpoke not of faith as <hi>Juſtifying,</hi> but as the condition of Salvation, which contains more then that which is the condition of our firſt juſtification. 2. I neuer termed thoſe <hi>Gospel-Precepts,</hi> which are not in ſome way proper to the Goſpel. And for the next words <hi>[That ſubjection to Chriſt is an Eſſential part of faith.]</hi> I confeſs I do not only take it for a certain Truth, but alſo of ſo great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that I am glad you have bent your ſtrength againſt it, and thereby occaſioned me to ſearch more throughly. But then, if you think (as you ſeem to do) that by <hi>[Subjection]</hi> I mean <hi>[Actual Obedience]</hi> you quite miſtake me: for I have
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:60968:186"/>
fully opened my mind to you about this in my Aphoriſ. that ſpeak only of the <hi>ſubjection</hi> of the <hi>Heart</hi>; and not of the <hi>Actual Obedience,</hi> which is the practiſe of it. I ſpeak but of the <hi>Acceptation</hi> of Chriſt for our Lord, or the <hi>Conſent</hi> thereto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo giving up our ſelves to be his Diſciples, Servants or Subjects. This I maintain to be an Eſſential part of juſtifying Faith, in the ſtrict and proper ſenſe of that word.</p>
                     <p>Its true that <hi>de jure</hi> Chriſt is King of Unbelievers, and ſo of them that acknowledge him not to be their King. But in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of nature, the acknowledging of his Dominion, and conſent thereto, and ſo receiving him to be our King, doth go before our obeying him as our King. As a woman in marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age-Covenant, taketh her Husband, as one whom ſhe muſt obey add be faithfull to: But that taking or conſenting, goes before the ſaid Obedience, as every Covenant before the performance of it. Yea though the ſame act ſhould be both an acknowledgement of, and conſent to the Authority, and alſo an obeying of it; yet it is <hi>Quatenus</hi> a <hi>conſent</hi> and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of that Authority, and not as it is an <hi>obeying</hi> of it, that I ſpeak of it when I aſcribe Juſtification to it: as faith in the <hi>common ſenſe</hi> is certainly an act of Obedience to God: and yet Divines ſay, it juſtifie; not as it is <hi>Obedience,</hi> but as an <hi>Inſtrument.</hi> So that by <hi>Heart-ſubjection to Chriſt,</hi> I mean that act by which we give up our ſelves to Chriſt as his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to be ruled by him; and by which we take him for our Soveraign on his Redemption-title. But when I judge the word <hi>Faith</hi> to be taken yet in a larger ſenſe, comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obedience, I never ſaid or thought that ſo it is the condition of our firſt Juſtification, nor will I contend with any that thinks the word is never taken ſo largely, it being to me a matter of ſmal moment.

Sometime more largely for the wills embracing alſo of the objec as an offered good, beſides the underſtandings Aſſent to the Truth of the
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:60968:187"/>
word which offereth it. The former is by the Apoſtle oft diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from Love, and is ſaid to work by Love; as the live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acts of the underſtanding produce anſwerable motions in the will. But the later is that faith which juſtifieth; to wit, The <hi>Receiving of an offered Chriſt.</hi> And this comprizeth both the Act of the Underſtanding and Will (as almoſt all Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Divines affirm.) But both theſe acts together are called <hi>Faith</hi> from the former, which is moſt ſtrictly ſo called: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the great difficulty then lay in Believing the Truth of the Goſpel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (and would do ſtill, if it were not for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of Credit, Education, Cuſtom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) therefore the whole work is thence denominated: though yet the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating of the work be in the Will, and the Underſtandings Act but preparatory thereto. 2.

That as the Apoſtle diſtinguiſheth between Faith, Hope and Love, So do I. 2. Faith taken ſtrictly for aſſent to Divine Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, produceth love in every one of the forementioned ſenſes (of the word Love:) 3. Juſtifying faith (comprizing the wills acceptance) produceth both the grace of Charity, as it is exerciſed on other objects, and alſo the following acts of it towards Chriſt the Mediator: And ſo I acknowledge that Faith worketh by Love, and that Love is not faith. But yet whether Love be not in ſome ſenſe eſſential to juſtifying faith, if you ſpeak only of Love to Chriſt, and that not as a diſtinct grace, but as it is comprized in our <hi>Acceptance</hi> of him at firſt, I ſhall leave to your conſideration, when you have firſt reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved theſe things. 1. Whether juſtifying faith be not an act of the Will as well as the Underſtanding? Few but Papiſts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it, and not all of them. 2. Whether <hi>Chriſt himſelf</hi> be not the object of it? Few Proteſtants will deny it. 3. Whether <hi>Good</hi> be not the <hi>object</hi> of the Will, and ſo Chriſt be not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led as Good? None doubts of it. 4. Whether this willing be not the ſame as Loving, as love is found in the rational ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite?

This is the Wills firſt act to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it object; and will you ſay that Love goes before juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying faith, and ſo before Juſtification? and ſuch a Love as is diſtinct from juſtifying faith as being no part of it? How then is Love the fruit of faith, and as Divines ſay, a conſequent of Juſtification?

                     <p>Nor do I think it a meet phraſe to ſay, <hi>we are juſtified by Love,</hi> (though in the ſenſe before mentioned, I think it true,) becauſe it is but a part, or affection as it were of that <hi>recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> by which we are juſtified, and ſtands not in ſo full a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the object received.</p>
                     <p>And yet, if I had ſaid none of all this, I ſee not that I need any more then to deny your conſequence, as being wholly ungrounded: For it followeth not, that if it be an eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial part, that therefore it muſt have the Denomination of the whole: yea, though the whole be ſaid to work by that part. The Brain and Heart are eſſential parts of the

Body: and yet not to be called the Body; and it is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to ſay that the body works by the Brain or Heart; or that the vegetative ſoul doth work by the natural heat and Spirits; then to ſay, the Body worketh by the Body, or the vegetative ſoul by it ſelf. I will explain all together in my uſual Similitude, which is Dr. <hi>Preſtons</hi> (or rather <hi>Pauls</hi>) A condemned Beggar is offered a Pardon, and alſo to be made a Queen, if ſhe will but take the Prince for her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.

But it is not Love as a Vertue in general, or as exerciſed on any other object, which is this eſſential part of the Condition: but only love to him whom ſhe marrieth: And ſo her firſt love is neceſſary to her Pardon and Dignity as begun; and her continued love (and marriage-faithfulneſs) is neceſſary to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as they are to be continued: (ſuppoſing the Prince to know the heart as Chriſt doth.) <hi>Qu.</hi> 2. <hi>Is it then a meet phraſe to ſay, that ſhe is pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and dignified by loving ſuch a Prince</hi>? Anſw. It hath ſome Truth in it, but it is not a fit ſpeech; but rather that it is <hi>by marrying him,</hi> becauſe Love is but a part, or as it were an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of that <hi>Marriage Covenant</hi> or <hi>conſent,</hi> which indeed doth dignifie her: Love may be without marriage, but not Marriage (cordially) without Love. So in our preſent caſe, juſtifying faith is the very Marriage Conſent or Covenant with Chriſt; It is therfore fitter to ſay, we are juſtified by it, then by love; becauſe the former expreſſeth the full conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: the latter not: <hi>Qu.</hi> 3. <hi>If love be an eſſential part of the Marriage-conſent, then may we not as well ſay, Marriage cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Marriage, as to ſay, Marriage cauſeth Love.</hi> Anſwer No. For 1. That Love which it cauſeth, is the following acts of Love. 2. And the name of Love is moſt uſually given only to the Paſſion which is in the ſenſitive; but not uſually to the meer <hi>Velle,</hi> the elicite act of the rational appetite. I have
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:60968:188"/>
been the more prolix on this, becauſe it ſerves alſo for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to other of your Objections, eſpecially the third.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. You object [<hi>Goſpel-Precepts are many, if not all, the ſame with the moral Law: if juſtified then by obedience to them; are we not juſtified by the works of the Law? &amp;c.</hi> Anſwer. 1. <hi>James</hi> yields the whole. 2. If you ſpeak of our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation at firſt, by which, of guilty and lyable to condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we become <hi>recti in curia,</hi> or are acquit, I then yield all that you ſeek here, <hi>viz.</hi> that we are not juſtified by works. 3. This objection is grounded on your formentioned miſtake of my meaning, as if I thought that juſtifying faith contained eſſentially ſuch obedience or works. 4. We are not juſtified by works of the Law, if you mean the Law of works, or by any works which make the reward to be not of Grace, but of Debt, which are the works that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of. 5. That which you call the moral Law, <hi>viz.</hi> the bare Precepts of the Decalogue, taken <hi>Diviſion,</hi> without the ſanction, <hi>viz</hi>: the Promiſe or the Commination, is not the Law, but one part of the Law: and the other part, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſanction adjoined, if diverſified, makes it two diſtinct Laws, though the Duty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded be the ſame. The Law that commandeth <hi>Socrates</hi> to drink <hi>Cicutam,</hi> is not the ſame with that which ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a ſick man to drink ſome for a cure. 6. That our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is continued, on condition of our ſincere obedience, added to our faith, I maintain with <hi>James.</hi> 7. Will you anſwer your own objection, and you tell me what to anſwer: Faith is a duty of the moral Law: if we are juſtified by faith, then we are juſtified by a work of the Law. I know you will not evade as thoſe that ſay, Faith is not a work, but a Paſſion: nor as thoſe that ſay, we are juſtified by it not as a work; but as an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for I have heard you diſclaim that. If you ſay it is not as a work, but as a condition by the free Law-giver appointed to this end, then you ſay as I do, both of faith, and ſecondarily of works. For what Divine denyeth works to be a condition of Salvation, or of the final Juſtification? or of our preſent Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication as continued, <hi>vel nor amittendi Juſtificationem jam re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>captam,</hi> as <hi>Conr. Bergius</hi> ſaith; I know but one other evaſion left in the world which I once thought none would have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:60968:189"/>
on; but lately an acute Diſputant (with me) main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, that faith <hi>is not conditio moralis, vel ex voluntate conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuentis,</hi> but <hi>Conditio phyſica vel ex natura rei.</hi> But I think I ſhall eaſily and quickly diſprove this opinion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rababs</hi> and <hi>Abrahams</hi> works were works of the New Law of Grace, and not of the old Law of works.</p>
                     <p>In a word, As there is a two fold Law, ſo there is a two fold Accuſation and Juſtification: when we are accuſed as breakers of the Law of works, that is, as <hi>ſinners</hi> in common ſort, and ſo as lyable to the penalty thereof, then we plead only Chriſts ſatiſfaction as our Righteouſneſ, and no work of our own: But when we are Accuſed of final non-performance of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the New Law, that is of being <hi>Rejectors of Chriſt the Mediator,</hi> we are juſtified by producing our faith and ſincere obedience to him. The former <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of; and <hi>James</hi> of the latter. You may ſee Divines of great Name ſaying as I in this, as <hi>Mead, Deodate</hi> on <hi>James</hi> the 2. but moſt fully <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus</hi> in <hi>Theſ. Salmurienſ. Theſ. de Juſtific.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>To your third Objection, <hi>That Faith, Repentance, Hope and Love (as before explained) are diſtinguiſhed,</hi> I eaſily yield you. But where you ſay <hi>(Faith and Love have different Objects, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one is no eſſential part of the other)</hi> I anſwer, That faith in Chriſt, and Love to the Saints (which your Texts mention) have different Objects, I ſoon confeſs. But faith in Chriſt (as it is the firſt Act of the Will) and love to Chriſt, have one and the ſame Object, beyond all doubt.</p>
                     <p>Your fourth I wholly yield, if you ſpeak of faith ſtrictly, or as it Juſtifieth, and not in a large improper ſence.</p>
                     <p>Your fifth is grounded on the forementioned miſtake of my meaning. And there needs no further anſwer, but only to tell you, that though ſincere obedience to all Chriſts Lawes be a part of the condition of our Juſtification as <hi>continued</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate at Judgement</hi>; yet it follows not that every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar duty muſt be done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no more then that <hi>Adam</hi> muſt obey eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular Law before he were actually juſt. It is ſufficient that there be no other defect in our Obedience, but what may ſtand with ſincerity. The ſame Precept may command, or make Duty to one, and not to another, and ſo be no Precept
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:60968:189"/>
as to him. A man that lives but an hour after his converſion is, bound ſincerely to obey Chriſt according to his Law: but he is not bound to build Churches, nor to do the work of twenty years. Chriſt may be received as King, (and is) in the ſame moment in which he is received as Juſtifier; and in that recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we covenant to obey him, and take him for our Lord to the death; but not to obey him on earth when we are dead; for we are then freed from theſe Lawes, and come under the Lawes of the Glorified.</p>
                     <p>To your ſixth I anſwer, The Texts alledged have no ſhew of contradicting the Point you oppos;ſe. One ſaith, <hi>we are juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by his Blood:</hi> But doth it thence follow, <hi>(therefore not by Believing in him or receiving him as King, are we made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of it.)</hi> His <hi>Blood</hi> is the Purchaſing cauſe, but we enquire after the condition on our part. The other Text ſaith, <hi>(through faith in his Blood.)</hi> But 1. it ſaith not <hi>only</hi> in his Blood. 2. And his blood is the Ground of his <hi>Dominion</hi> as well as of his <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying</hi> us: for by his blood he bought all into his own hands: <hi>For to this end he Died, Roſe and Revived, that he might be Lord of Dead and Living.</hi> Rom. 14.9. It may be therefore <hi>through faith in his Blood,</hi> as the chief part of the ſatisfaction, and yet neceſſarily alſo through faith in <hi>himſelf,</hi> or the Reception of <hi>himſelf</hi> as the Chriſt. 3. Yet doth the Apoſtle moſt conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſay, <hi>(through faith in his blood)</hi> rather then <hi>(through faith in his Dominion or Government,)</hi> becauſe when he ſpeaks of Faith, he ſpeaks Relatively: not (as ſome underſtand it) by Faith meaning Chriſt, but uſing the name of that Act which fitlieſt and fullieſt relates to its Object; and ſo intending the Object more principally then the Act. And as it is fitter to ſay, that <hi>(we are Juſtified by Chriſts blood,)</hi> then that <hi>(we are Juſtified by his Kingly Power,)</hi> therefore the Apoſtle rather ſpeaks of <hi>faith in his blood,</hi> as neerlieſt relating to the Object. Yet, as he excludes not Chriſts obedience, (for <hi>by his obedience many are made Righteous</hi>) nor <hi>faith in his obedience,</hi> and in his whole humiliation as well as his blood; and in his <hi>Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Interceſſion and Exaltation</hi>; ſo not in his <hi>Kingly Office.</hi> Look back on the former Example to make this plain. A poor condemned woman is delivered and Dignified by marrying a
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:60968:190"/>
Prince that hath redeemed her on that condition. When ſhe ſpeaks of her <hi>Deliverance,</hi> ſhe will ſay, <hi>[I am delivered by the Bounty, Goodneſs or Redemption of my Prince, and ſo by marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him that in mercy Redeemed me.]</hi> rather then <hi>[I am deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by marrying a Prince to Rule me.]</hi> Becauſe in the former ſhe more fitly &amp; fully expreſſeth more of the cauſe of her Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: Much leſs will ſhe think it a fit ſpeech to ſay, <hi>I am deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by marrying an Avenger of his enemies, a Condemner, a Puniſher,</hi> &amp;c.) as you are pleaſed to ſpeak in this our caſe. And yet who doubts, but her marrying or taking him for her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band hereafter to Rule her, as well as preſently to Deliver her, is the very true <hi>Condition</hi> on her part of her Deliverance? Yea, and if you ſpeak not only of her <hi>Deliverance,</hi> but of her Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity (being enriched, Honoured and made a Queen,) it is the fitteſt phraſe to ſay (<hi>it was by her marrying a Prince.</hi>) And ſo if you ſpeak not only of Pardon and Juſtification (which import our Deliverance <hi>in ſtatum quo prius,</hi>) but alſo of our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption to be ſons, and Kings, and Heirs with Chriſt, it is no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit phraſe to ſay, <hi>This is by our marrying King Jeſus</hi>; or <hi>by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Chriſt as the King by Redemption.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All the Benefits which we Receive from Chriſt (which follow Union) ſuch as are Pardon, Juſtification and Adoption, do flow from our Union with himſelf which precedes them. This Union is by Faith: We are united to him as to a Head, Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and Prince, and not only as a Juſtifier? therefore from him received as a Head, Huſband and Prince, do theſe Benefits of Juſtification and Adoption flow.</p>
                     <p>To your ſeventh Objection I anſwer, by denying the latter part of your Antecedent [<hi>that Scripture nowhere makes</hi> (Chriſts Dominion you ſay, but) <hi>Chriſtum Dominum</hi> (you ſhould ſay,) <hi>the Object of juſtifying Faith.</hi>] I never thought that Chriſts Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, nor yet his Redemption was the proper Object of the chiefeſt act of Juſtifying Faith. But Chriſt himſelf as Lord and as Redeemer is. I prove it, 1. <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the proper Object of juſtifying Faith (as I ſhall anon prove.) But the name <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſignifieth as directly and fully his Kingly Office as his Juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. If you include not his being King, you Receive him not as Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="353" facs="tcp:60968:190"/>2. To Receive him as Redeemer is to Receive him as King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For his very Redeeming was a Purchaſing them into his own hands, (<hi>Joh.</hi> 13.3. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.18 <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.2. &amp; 3.35. <hi>Luke</hi> 10.22. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.20, 21. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.26, 27. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.9 &amp;c.) though not only ſo.</p>

(I hope you will not ſay, that the only Burden that Chriſt offers here to eaſe them of, was the phariſes rigorous Interpretation of the Law, as I was told you expound it.)</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Luke</hi> 19.27. <hi>Theſe mine enemies that would not I ſhould Reign over them,</hi> &amp;c. If Rejecting Chriſt as King be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning ſin according to the tenor of the New Law; then Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting him as King is part of the condition of Juſtification. The Conſequence is plain, becauſe the ſaid Rejection con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth, as it is the non-performance of that condition which muſt be performed to the avoiding of condemnation. More Scriptures might be brought; but the firſt Argument alone is ſuficient, if there were no more.</p>
                     <p>To your eighth Objection I anſwer. The Object of juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith is Chriſt himſelf principally; and the word as both Revealing, Offering him, Promiſing, Threatning: but it is not <hi>Chriſt commanding,</hi> firſt, but Chriſt as King <hi>to Command.</hi> This is anſwered in the former.</p>
                     <p>To your ninth Objection I anſwer; when I ſay that <hi>[Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Chriſt as Lord is one part of Juſtifying Faith,]</hi> I ſpeak not of the Act morally, as if it had two parts where it is entire: It is but one moral Act to <hi>Accept</hi> of whole Chriſt (if you ſpeak
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:60968:191"/>
ſimply of Accepting, as diſtinct from preceding Aſſent and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent Affiance.) But I call it <hi>(part)</hi> in reference to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, whence you ſay ariſeth the Difference: Though Chriſts Office of Mediator be but one; yet from the works of that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice we look on his Governing, and Pardoning or Juſtifying as diſtinct parts: and thence I call this act of faith <hi>(a part.)</hi> For that you ſay of obedience following faith and as an effect and ſign, I eaſily yield it.</p>
                     <p>But where you ſay, that <hi>[Truſt is the Genus where the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is an incomplex term]</hi> I anſwer; if you take faith as it is juſtifying (or the condition of our Juſtification) and not in the ſtricteſt ſenſe, ſo it hath more Acts then one about the incomplex term. And Affiance is the Genus of one only. To accept (an offered Saviour,) is an Act precedent in order of Nature before any other act of the Will; that is, the elicite Acts are before the Imperate: and Truſt is not the Genus of this. Beſides, Truſt is no one act, but many, and that of both faculties, and a Negation of ſeveral acts beſides. A certain Argument that it is no one ſingle Act that juſtifieth, even in their Judgement that ſay Affiance is the juſtifying Act; when the Scripture ſpeaks of faith as Affiance, it includes Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance or conſent, which go before Affiance in order of nature; Yea ſome of our moſt Learned, Accurate Divines, when they ſay Affiance is the juſtifying faith, do either by Affiance mean only that elicite act of the Will, which I call Acceptance, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent or Election, or elſe (rather) they mean ſeveral acts, whereof this is one. So <hi>Ameſius Medul.</hi> l. 1. cap. 3. §. 13. <hi>Fides iſt a qua credimus non tantum Deum, aut Deo, ſed in Deum, eſt vera ac propia fiducia: non qua hac voca notatur certa &amp; abſoluta perſuaſio de bono futuro, ſed quâ ſignificat</hi> Electionem <hi>&amp; Apprehenſionem ſufficientis ac idonei medi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="355" facs="tcp:60968:191"/>
of the Will) as <hi>Ameſius</hi> doth, then I am of your mind. If you ſay that <hi>Velle vel Acceptare</hi> is not <hi>credere vel fidem babere</hi> in the common notation of the word: I anſwer 1. It includes <hi>Velle</hi> as its principal Act in the common uſe of the word, when its object is an <hi>Incompelx term:</hi> but indeed it includeth more alſo. 2.

I anſwer in the words of <hi>Ameſius, Medul.</hi> l. 1. c. 3. §. 2, 3 <hi>Credere vulgo ſignificat actum intellectus Aſſenſum teſtimonio praebentis: ſed quoniam conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenter volunt as moveri ſolet, &amp; extendere ſeſe ad amplectendu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bonum it a probatum, ideirco fides <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Yea further, I doubt not but where this act of the Will is in ſincerity, there is Juſtification certainly conſequent: but the term <hi>Affiance</hi> contains ſome acts which Divines ſay, do only follow Juſtification: which alſo <hi>Ameſi.</hi> ſeems to acknowledge, <hi>ibid.</hi> § 21. <hi>Quod vero fiducia dicitur fructus fidei, verum eſt de fiducia prout reſpicit Deum in futurum, &amp; eſt ſpes f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>Surely an unwillingneſs to accept Chriſt for our Lord and Saviour, is no ſmall part of the condemning ſin, which we therefore call the rejecting of Chriſt; <hi>The treading him under foot; Neglecting ſo great Salvation; Not willing to come to Chriſt for life; Making light of him,</hi> when they are invited to the marriage, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 22.) and <hi>making excuſes: Not-kiſſiing the ſon,</hi> (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.) with many the like, which import the Wills refuſal of Chriſt himſelf, and not only its unwillingneſs to believe the Truth of the Promiſe or Declaration of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</p>
                     <p>To your tenth Objection I anſwer by denying the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; we ſpeak of the ſoul as rational, and not as ſenſitive or vegetative. When the underſtanding &amp; Will receive Chriſt, the whole ſoul doth it: that is, every faculty, or the ſoul by a
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:60968:193"/>
full entire motion in its ſeveral Actings to the Object pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, both as true and good. Your Joy, Hope, Fear, are in the ſenſitive: And <hi>Love</hi> as a Paſſion, and as commonly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. And for <hi>Memory,</hi> take it for an act of the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; or of Underſtanding and Imagination conjunct; or for a third faculty as pleaſe your ſelf, it will not breed any difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the caſe. But whether Fear be properly a Receiving of Chriſt, or any Object as Good, I much queſtion. I take it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the ſhunning of an evil, then the Reception of Good. So much for your Objections.</p>
                     <p>I will next, as impartially as I can, conſider your Anſwers to what I laid down for the proof of the Point in Queſtion. But firſt I muſt acknowledge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that I have given you and others great advantage againſt the Doctrine of that Book, by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>methodicalneſs, and neglect of Art, and not giving the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in form, which I then thought not ſo neceſſary as now I perceive it is: (for I was ready to yield wholly to <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beeufs</hi> reaſons againſt formal arguing, <hi>Praefat. ante lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertate.</hi>) The preſent expectation of death cauſed me to make that haſte, which I now repent: yet, though I ſee ſome over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſights in the manner of expreſſion, I ſee no cauſe to change my mind in the Doctrine of it.</p>
                     <p>Alſo I muſt deſire you to remember here, that the proof ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on your part, and not on mine: <hi>Affirmanti incumbit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batio.</hi> It is acknowledged by almoſt all, that <hi>fides qua Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat, Juſtifying</hi> faith is a Receiving of Chriſt as Lord, and not only as Saviour or Juſtifier: And you and I are agreed on it, that Faith juſtifieth not as an Inſtrument, but as a Condition: ſo that they who will go further here, and maintain that yet Faith juſtifieth only As it Receiveth Chriſt as Juſtifier, or as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and not as King, muſt prove what they ſay. If I prove 1. that Faith juſtifieth as the Condition, on performance whereof the Gift is conferred. 2. And that this Faith which is the Condition, is the Accepting of Chriſt as Chriſt, or the Anointed King and Saviour: (both which are yielded me;) I muſt needs think that I have proved that the Receiving Chriſt as King, doth as truly Juſtifie, as the Receiving him as Prieſt or Juſtifier: (Yet I had rather not ſay that either Juſtifies,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:60968:193"/>
(becauſe 1. it is no Scripture phraſe, 2. and ſeemeth to import an Efficiency<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) but rather, that <hi>[we are juſtified by it,]</hi> which imports here but a conditionality, and is the Scripture phraſe.) Till you have proved your excluſion of faith in one reſpect from the Juſtifying Office, and your confinement of it to the other, my proof ſtands good: I give you the entire condition: and <hi>ubi Lex non diſtinguit, non eſt diſtinguendum; multó minus dividendum.</hi> And though thoſe that aſſert the proper Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentality of faith in Juſtifying, or elſe the meer natural condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionality, may have ſomething to ſay for their Diviſion; (though with foul abſurdities) Yet what you can ſay, (who have eſcaped thoſe conceits) I cannot imagine. Me thinks, if faith Juſtifie, as the condition of the Grant or Covenant, and this condition be the Receiving of Chriſt as Lord and Saviour, it ſhould be impoſſible to exclude the receiving Chriſt as King, from Juſtifying, till you firſt exclude it from the ſaid conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality. <hi>A Quatenus ad omne valet conſequentia.</hi> To Juſtifie therefore <hi>As</hi> the condition (on which the Promiſe gives Chriſt, and with him Juſtification,) muſt needs infer that we are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by all whatſoever hath ſuch a conditionality. Yet (as I ſaid before) when we intend to expreſs, not only or principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Act of the Receiver, but alſo, or principally, the Grace of the Giver, then it is a fitter phraſe to ſay, we are Juſtified by faith in his Blood, or by Receiving Chriſt the Saviour and Juſtifier: becauſe it fullieſt and fitlieſt expreſſeth that Grace which we intend, (and thus <hi>Paul</hi> oft doth.) So that they who diſtinguiſh between <hi>Fides quae Juſtificat,</hi> and <hi>Fides qua Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat</hi> and admit that Act into the former, which they exclude from the latter, muſt prove what they ſay. <hi>(Fides qua juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat, non Recipit Chriſtum vel ut Regem vel ſacerdotem, ſed tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Juſtificat. i. e. Qua eſt Conditio, non eſt Receptio: Nec qua Recipit Juſtificat; i. e. Qua Receptio, non eſt Conditio: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria &amp; forma non ſunt confundenda. Actus fidei eſt quaſi ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria, vel Aptitudo tantum ad officium conditionalitatis: Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio igitur ipſa eſt inepta.)</hi> Now to your Anſwers: (Pardon this prolixity.)</p>
                     <p>Firſt I muſt tell you, that by that phraſe <hi>[the whole ſoul]</hi> I mean the <hi>entire motion of the ſoul</hi> by Underſtanding and Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:60968:194"/>
to its Object both as True and Good: For I know the whole ſoul may be ſaid to underſtand in every Intellectual Action, and to will in every act of willing. But when it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtands or Aſſents, and not willeth, it doth not Act fully according to its Power, nor according to the nature of its Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, when the Goodneſs is neglected, and the Truth only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended. And it is not a compleat motion, ſeeing the Acts of the underſtanding are but introductory or preparatory to thoſe of the Will, where the motion of the Rational ſoul is compleat. And ſo my Argument ſtands thus: If Juſtifying faith be the Act both of the underſtanding and the Will, then it is not one ſingle act only: But <hi>&amp;c. Ergo,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Prob. Anteced.</hi> Juſtifying faith is the Receiving of Chriſt: but Chriſt is Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Underſtanding and Will; (by the former incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly, by the latter compleatly:) therefore Juſtifying faith is the Acting both of the Underſtanding and Will. <hi>Probatur Minor.</hi> Chriſt muſt be Received as Good, and not only his Word (or himſelf) as true: therefore he muſt be Received by the Will as well as the Underſtanding: for Goodneſs is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Will.</p>
                     <p>Here you anſwer 1. by confeſſing, that Faith is called a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of Chriſt: 2. by interpreting that ſpeech [He is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the receiving his Word, which is received by Aſſent.] This is worth a fuller enquiry, becauſe the diſcovery of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Object of Faith, will ſhew the proper Act. The Intellec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Act [Aſſent) hath for its <hi>Objectum formale</hi> the Veracity of God, or the Authority of Gods Revealing or Teſtifying: This is not it that we enquire after. The material Object (for we muſt uſe the Schools termes in this diſtinction, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps fitter might be found,) is 1. <hi>Proximius</hi>; that is, the moral Verity of the Teſtimony or Word. 2. <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lterius,</hi> the Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Verity of the Things ſignified (as Chriſts Perſon, God-head, Incarnation, Reſurrection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) The former is but the means to the latter, and for its ſake, and not for its ſelf. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of this act of Aſſent, you may ſay as you do, that Chriſt is Received by receiving his Word: becauſe the Belief of the Truth of the Enuntiation is the means of our apprehending the truth of the Thing propounded. But then 1. Theſe are yet
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:60968:194"/>
two diſtinct Acts as the Objects are diſtinct. 2. And this Intellectual Act is called a <hi>Receiving</hi> of the Truth Believed but imperfectly becauſe it leads to that Act of the Will which (in morality) is more fitly and fully called a Receiving: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if Aſſent produce not that Acceptation or conſent of the Will, it cannot fitly it ſelf be called a Receiving of Chriſt. (For of the Intellects Reception of the Intelligible <hi>Species,</hi> I ſuppoſe we neither of us ſpeak.) The material Object of Juſtifying faith as it is in the Will, is 1. Principal, and Adaequate, which is Chriſt himſelf. 2. Subſervient or Inſtrumental, which is the Covenant, Promiſe, or teſtamentary Gift, in &amp; by which Chriſt is offered and Given. Theſe are two diſtinct Acts, as the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting of a Teſtament, and of the Legacy: of a Pardon writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and the real Pardon thereby ſignified: or of the Oath of Allegiance, and of the Prince to whom we ſwear. But becauſe of the Relation between the one and the other, Faith may be called a receiving of Chriſt, or a receiving of the Goſpel. Yet ſo, as ſtill the proper principal Object is Chriſt, and the Goſpel but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now (if I am able to underſtand you) your words import, that in your Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Chriſt is received two wayes: 1. by Faith, and that is only by Aſſent: and this is only by receiving his Word: that is, in Believing it to be True. 2. By other Graces; and thoſe I think, you refer to the Wills receiving. Againſt this opinion I further alledge, 1.

I know there is a Metonymie in the word <hi>Receive</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in ſtrict ſpeech in Phyſicks, <hi>Recipere eſt pati</hi>) But it is ſo uſual and near, that in morality it is taken for a proper ſpeech, to call the Acceptation of an offered good <hi>[A Receiving.]</hi>

                     <p n="3">3. There is ſuch a thing as the proper accepting of Chriſt, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as of flat neceſſity to Juſtification and Salvation: But this acceptation is not in Scripture called by the name of any other Grace: therefore it is taken for an Act of faith. The Maj. I hope no Chriſtian will deny. For when Chriſt is offered to the world as their Saviour, Redeemer, Teacher, King-Husband; who can think that the accepting of him is not required, yea even in the offer? Not a phyſical Reception which ſome abſurdly and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly dream of, but a moral; as when a people take a man for their King or Teacher; or a woman takes a man for her Husband. And for the Minor: Receiving Chriſt offered is not uſually expreſſed in the term, Hope, Joy, Charity, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; therefore it is included in the word <hi>Faith</hi> (unleſs you can name ſome other Grace which it is uſually expreſſed by.)</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Grace by which we are united to Chriſt is Faith: But it is receiving Chriſt by which we are ſo united to him; therefore it is faith which is the receiving of Chriſt. I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe none will deny that it is Chriſt himſelf that we muſt be united to by believing, and not the Word or Promiſe; and that it is receiving Chriſt which unites us to him, is obvious both from the language of Scripture, and the nature of the thing. A People is united to their Prince, as the head of the
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:60968:195"/>
Republique, and a Church to their Teacher, and a woman to her Husband, by the Wills conſent or acceptance, and not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (but only initially, preparatorily, imperfectly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly, and if it be alone, not at all) by believing the Truth of their words. <hi>Ameſius</hi> ſaith, <hi>Medul.</hi> l. 1. c. 3. §. 18 <hi>Fides etiam cum ſit primus actus vitae noſtrae, qua Deo in Chriſto vivimus, conſiſtat neceſſe eſt in unione cum Deo, quam nullo modo facere poteſt Aſſenſus adhibitus veritati quae eſt de Deo.</hi>

That Act which cannot be diſcerned in a Saint (in it ſelf) from what may be in the wicked, is not the receiving of Chriſt (fully or properly) which juſtifies: But the Act of Aſſent to the Truth of the Goſpel, as it is in a Saint, cannot in it ſelf be diſcerned from what may be in the wicked. Therefore the Act of Aſſent is not the Receiving of Chriſt which juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies.</p>
                     <p>The Major is hence evident: In that juſtifying faith being the condition of our Juſtification, muſt needs be the great Mark to know by, whether we are juſtified or no: But if it could not be known to be ſincere it ſelf, in vain is it made a

If you acknowledge that other Graces receive Chriſt as well as Faith, and receiving of Chriſt doth make him ours, and ſo juſtifie; then you muſt acknowledge that other Graces juſtifie as well as faith; (yea not ſecondarily only, but as Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally as Faith:) But that you will be loth to do. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence will not be avoided, but by ſhewing that there is a twofold receiving of Chriſt, and that one juſtifieth, and the other not: which when you have proved from Scripture, I will yield: but then at leaſt I ſhall gain this, that receiving Chriſt juſtifies not properly <hi>ex natura actus, ſed ex voluntate Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis:</hi> and if I get that, I get the main part of the cauſe in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Affiance is judged by Divines to be an Act of the Will: But Affiance is judged by the ſame Divines to be the juſtifying Act: Therefore they judge that the juſtifying Act (and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the Reception of Chriſt) belongs to the Will.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. The <hi>Velle</hi> or Elicite act of the Will which I inſiſt on, is the very firſt Act, and goes before Affiance (as it denotes any other Act of the Will:) Therefore either this <hi>Velle</hi> muſt be the juſtifying Faith and Reception of Chriſt, or elſe they muſt ſay that there is a ſaving reception of Chriſt that goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the juſtifying or Reception: which ſure they will not grant, that make that Faith the <hi>actus primas vitae ſpiritualis.</hi>

Laſtly, The opinion ſeems to me ſo Improbable, without and againſt reaſon, and ſo dangerous [that God doth aſſign one only Act of the ſoul to the Office of juſtifying, eſpecially the act of aſſent] that I dare not entertain it without proof It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable that in a Moral, Political, Theological Matter, the Holy Ghoſt ſhould ſpeak, as if it were in the ſtricteſt diſcourſe of Phyſicks. It is improbable that God ſhould ſpeak to man in ſuch a Moral diſcourſe, ſo as no men uſe to ſpeak, and therefore ſo as men could not, without a further explication underſtand. Doth he that ſpeaks of receiving a man to be our Husband, King, Maſter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> mean it of one only Act? (though I know Conſent is the chief.) Or he that gives any great matter on Condition of ſuch Receiving, Doth he mean that any one ſingle Act is that Condition? Much leſs Aſſent.</p>
                     <p>Or is there any likelyhood, that when other Acts do receive the ſame Object, Chriſt, in a way of as high honouring him, that yet God ſhould confine Juſtification to one Act, ſetting by all the reſt? Yea when the reſt are acknowledged to be part of the Condition? (and Receiving as Lord, to be the <hi>fides quae</hi>?) I know God is not bound to give man a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his Laws: but yet he uſually doth it: and we muſt take heed of aſſerting that to be Gods Law, which appears unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, till we can prove what we ſay. Yea what a dangerous loſs will Chriſtians then be at, who will hardly ever be able to find out this ſingle Act, what it is and when they have it? And he that knows how quick Spirits are in their actings, and withall how little able we are to obſerve and diſcern them, perhaps many doubt, whether you can find a name for any ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle act of a ſoul, or know when it is one Act, and when many.

Again, as I ſaid, the <hi>whole</hi> is denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the firſt leading and moſt difficult Act: the Language of Scripture is much fitted to the times and temper of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to whom it was ſpoken. Now the Jews did generally and gladly acknowledge that the Meſſias or Mediator muſt be <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, Welcomed, Honoured, Loved, ſubmitted to:</hi> but they could not <hi>Believe that Chriſt was he</hi>; And this was fooliſhneſs to the Gentiles alſo, as well as a ſtumbling-block to the Jews; that one that lived and walked among them, and ſeemed a poor contemptible man, and at laſt was crucified, ſhould be God and the great Redeemer and Lord of the world. I tremble ſometimes to think, if we had lived our ſelves in thoſe times, how hard it would have been even to us to believe; ſo that when the great Difficult act is named, the other (Conſent and Affiance) are ſtill implyed, and included. I will end with <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> true obſervation to this purpoſe, <hi>Medul. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 3. <hi>Quam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis in ſcripturis aliquando Aſcenſus veritati quae eſt de Deo &amp; Chriſto,</hi> Joh. 1.50. <hi>habetur pro vera fide; includitur tamen ſemper ſpecialis fiducia: at<expan>

(§ 20.)</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Argument which you anſwer, lyeth thus. If Faith be the work of the Heart and the whole Heart, then it is not only in the Underſtanding, but in the Will alſo. But the former is the words of Scripture, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.37. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.10. <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="367" facs="tcp:60968:197"/>Here you anſwer that [<hi>the whole heart notes not every inward faculty, but (as often) ſincerity.</hi>] To which I Reply, 1. The word <hi>[whole]</hi> I yield to <hi>Illyricus</hi> ſignifies the <hi>ſincerity,</hi> which is uſually expreſſed by <hi>Integrity,</hi> but the word <hi>[Heart]</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the <hi>ſubject</hi>; and is commonly taken for the <hi>Will,</hi> and oft for the <hi>whole ſoul, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding and Will,</hi> (as moſt Fathers, Schoolmen and Divines judge in the Point, though the two former placed too much of it in the Aſſent:) but where and how oft do you find the word <hi>[Heart]</hi> uſed for the ſole Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect? I pray ſhew the place. 2. The proverbial ſpeech <hi>[with all the Heart]</hi> is not uſed in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.10. but only ſubject barely expreſſed: <hi>with the Heart man believeth to Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>My third Argument (as you place it) was to another uſe, which is of leſs moment. As I judge Faith to be taken, 1. ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more ſtrictly for meer Aſſent to a Teſtimony: (ſo <hi>James</hi> takes it when he ſaith, the Devils believe.) 2. And ſometimes more fully for Aſſent and Acceptance, or Conſent: (ſo <hi>Paul</hi> takes it; and ſo it Juſtifieth.) So 3. I ſuppoſe it is ſometime taken moſt largely and improperly, for the full performance of the conditions of the New Covenant. If any deny this, I have no mind to contend for it, becauſe it is but about a word, and not the thing. Your anſwer is twofold: 1. <hi>that</hi> Heb. 5.9. <hi>ſpeaks of obeying Chriſt, but doth not call faith obeying Chriſt.</hi> I Reply. That Obedience which containeth the Condition of ſalvation by Chriſt (whereof Juſtification is a part) muſt needs include Faith: But the word Obedience <hi>Heb.</hi> 5 9 containeth the condition of ſalvation by Chriſt; therefore it includes faith. <hi>He is become the Author of Eternal ſalvation to all them that obey him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Your ſecond anſwer is, [<hi>It may be obedience by Aſſent, that Chriſt is the Meſſiah, died, roſe,</hi> &amp;c.] Repl. 1. If Obedience of meer Aſſent be not made the condition of Eternal ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Scripture, then it is not that obedience which is here mentioned: But the former is true: therefore the latter. 2. The firſt Aſſent to theſe Goſpel Truths is not in a full proper ſence called Obedience to Chriſt at all: therefore not here to be ſo underſtood. As ſubjection, ſo obedience is a term of Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:60968:198"/>
on ſuppoſing the Authority of a Superior, the acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that Authority, A command from that Superior, and that the action be therefore done becauſe ſo commanded. Now the firſt Aſſent to, or acknowledgement of the Redeemers Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and Soveraignty, muſt needs in order of Nature precede all obedience to him as a Soveraign. I confeſs improperly a man may be ſaid to obey, when he yields to the Reaſon and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of another; but this wants the very form of obedience pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called. If it be true that the firſt Acceptance of Chriſt for our Soveraign as Redeemer, by the Wills conſent, may be both the Reception of him for King, and Obedience to him: Yet in order of Nature it is reſpectively a Reception firſt; though in time it is both at once. But the firſt Aſſent to Chriſts Soveraignty cannot be an obeying him as Soveraign. And for the underſtanding the Text, when I find Chriſt give the world, a ſyſteme of Precepts, and tell them that he is become the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Eternal Salvation to all them that obey him, I dare not without Reaſon reſtrain that obedience (in the ſence of it) to ſome one or two acts: Eſpecially when I find that he hath made the like promiſe on condition of other acts of ours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Believing: as in many Text I have ſhewed in thoſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor. <hi>Take my yoke and burden,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Learn of me to be meek and lowly,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and I will eaſe you, and ye ſhall find reſt: For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give and ye ſhall be forgiven. He that confeſſeth and forſaketh his ſin ſhall have mercy,</hi> with multitudes of the like. And <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. that is called <hi>Faith,</hi> ver. 14, 17. which is called <hi>obeying the Gospel,</hi> ver. 16. And if the Goſpel do as directly and urgent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly command <hi>Conſent</hi> as <hi>Aſſent</hi>; yea if it command love to Chriſt as of equal neceſſity with both, I have reaſon to think that in this large ſence, Faith includes it. Why ſhould <hi>obeying the Gospel,</hi> and <hi>obeying the Truth,</hi> be made <hi>Synonima's</hi> with Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving as it is <hi>one</hi> ſingle Act, when the Goſpel commands many other Acts as of aequal neceſſity and excellency? Let me ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue thus <hi>ex conceſſis,</hi> from your ſelf and others. Moſt Divines affirm that the proper Reaſon why Faith juſtifieth, is its Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Chriſt; becauſe it is a Receiving of him (it juſtifies <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative i.e.</hi> A Chriſt received Juſtifies:) but Mr. <hi>Tomb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The word <hi>[Goſpel]</hi> is principally ſpoken of the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Good tidings or Mercy by Chriſt (but ſure not only of the Hiſtorical or Declaratory part, but alſo, yea principally of the Promiſe or Offer:) but the whole New Covenant or <hi>Law</hi> of Chriſt (for ſo it is, and ſo the Ancients unaminouſly call it) containing Precepts and Threatnings alſo, is called his Teſtament, Covenant, Goſpel, being ſo denominated from the more excellent part. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.18.19, 22. The <hi>Teſtament of Jeſus</hi> is oppoſed to the <hi>Commandments of the Law,</hi> and called <hi>Better</hi>: therefore it comprizeth Chriſts Commands, proper to him.

You know that not <hi>Wotton</hi> and many great Divines of <hi>England</hi> only, but of the moſt famous Tranſmarine, do take
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:60968:199"/>
                        <hi>Juſtification</hi> and <hi>Remiſſion</hi> to be one and the ſame thing. I have received Animadverſions from divers learned Divines lately on theſe Aphoriſms, and three or four of them blame me for making any difference between Juſtification and Remiſſion; though I make as little as may be. And can you think then that Remiſſion and Juſtification have ſeveral conditions? If they are not wholly the ſame, yet doubtleſs the difference is exceeding ſmall, and rather notional then real. The ſame Commination of the Law doth both condemn and oblige to puniſhment. Remiſſion is a diſcharge from the Obligation to Puniſhment; and Juſtification is a diſcharge from the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. So much then as that Obligation to Puniſhment, differs from the Laws condemnation, (which is nothing, or ſo little as it is not obvious to be diſcerned,) ſo much doth Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion differ from Juſtification. Yea even thoſe Divines that in pleading for the intereſt of the active Righteouſneſs to Juſtification, do to that end make Juſtification to have two parts; yet one of them, they ſay, is Remiſsion <hi>of ſin</hi>; as the other is the <hi>Imputation of Righteouſneſs.</hi> And I pray how then can theſe two parts of the ſame Juſtification have two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers conditions, ſo as one is appropriated to one, and excluded from the other? I remember no reformed Divines, but they either make Juſtification and Remiſsion to be all one; or Remiſsion to be part of Juſtification, or elſe to be two Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (or other effects) immediately and at once (in order of time, if not of nature) reſulting or proceeding from the ſame foundation (materially) or other cauſe. Though <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker</hi> and <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> make them to differ, it is but in this nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row (and almoſt unconceivable way) but in time to concur. I muſt therfore differ from you in this, that they have divers conditions: and wait for your proof of it. But it ſeems you will give us leave to ſay, <hi>A man is not pardoned by faith only</hi>; And yet he is <hi>juſtified by faith only</hi>! and that as a condition! Faith then it ſeems can do the whole, but not one half (as ſome judge) or can do, and not do the ſame thing (as others.)</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But do you think that Repentance is not neceſſarily <hi>Antecedent</hi> to <hi>Juſtification,</hi> as well as to <hi>Remiſſion</hi>? If you ſay No; the current of the Goſpel Doctrine will confute you:
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:60968:200"/>
which uſually putteth Repentance before Faith: and thoſe Divines that ſay it followeth after it, do yet make them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in order of time. But if Repentance do neceſſarily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede Juſtification, (as I doubt not but you will yield) then let me know to what purpoſe, or under what notion or reſpect, if not as a Condition? Can you find any lower place to give it? 3. But if you ſhould mean that Faith and Repentance are the condition of our firſt Juſtification and Remiſsion, but afterwards only of our Remiſsion. I Anſwer, 1. According to your Judgement (who take Juſtification to be one act tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient, once only performed, and neither a continued Act, nor renewed, or repeated,) neither Faith nor Repentance after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards performed, are any conditions of our Juſtification in this Life. This may ſeem a heavy charge, but it is a plain Truth. For that Juſtification which we receive upon our firſt believing hath only that firſt Act of faith for its condition (or as others ſpeak, its Inſtrumental cauſe) We are not juſtified to day by that act of Faith, which we ſhall perform to Morrow, or a Twelvemonth hence; ſo that according to your opinion, and all that go that way, it is only one (the firſt) Act of Faith which juſtifies; and all the following Acts through our whole life, do no more to our Juſtification, then the works of the Law do. I would many other Divines that go your way (for it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon as to the diſpatching of Juſtification by one Act) would think of this foul abſurdity. (You may add this alſo to what is ſaid before, againſt your opinion herein,) Where then is the Old Doctrine of the <hi>juſt living by faith, as to Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>? I may bear with theſe men (or at leaſt, need not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,) for not admitting Obedience or other Graces to be conditions of Juſtification as continued, when they will not admit faith it ſelf. Who ſpeaks more againſt faith, they or I? When I admit as neceſſary that firſt act, and maintain the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity of repeated acts, to our continued Juſtification; and they exclude all ſave one Inſtantaneous act? 2. And what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can any man give, why Repentance ſhould be admitted as a condition of our firſt Juſtification, and yet be no condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the continuance of it? or what proof is there from Scripture for this? I ſhall prove that the continuance of our
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:60968:200"/>
Juſtification hath more to its condition then the beginning; (though learned men, I know gain-ſay it:) but ſurely leſs it cannot have.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. But why do you ſay only of <hi>Repentance</hi> that <hi>[it is the condition of Remiſion]</hi> and of <hi>forgiving others,</hi> that <hi>[it is the condition of entring into life?]</hi> Have you not Chriſts expreſs words, that <hi>forgiving others</hi> is a condition of our <hi>Remiſſion? if ye forgive men their treſpaſſes, your heavenly Father will forgive you; but if you forgive not men,</hi> &amp;c. Nay, is not Reformation and Obedience ordinarily made a condition of <hi>forgiveneſs?</hi> I refer you to the Texts cited in my <hi>Aphoriſms: Waſh you, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>then if your ſins be as crimſon,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>He that confeſſeth and forſaketh his ſin, ſhall have mercy.</hi> And I would have it conſidered, if Remiſſion and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification be either the ſame, or ſo neer as all Divines make them, whether it be poſſible, that forgiving others, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>format on or new Obedience ſhould be a condition of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance or renewal of a pardoning Act, and not of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Doubtleſs, the general Juſtification muſt be continued, as well as the general pardon: and a particular Juſtification I think after particular ſins, is needfull as well as particular par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don: or if the name ſhould be thought improper, the thing cannot be denyed. Judicious <hi>Ball</hi> ſaith as much as I (yet men were not ſo angry with him,) <hi>Treat.</hi> of <hi>Covenant.</hi> pag. 20.21. [<hi>A diſpoſition to good works is neceſſary to Juſtification, being the qualification of an active lively faith.

                        <pb n="374" facs="tcp:60968:201"/>5. How will you ever prove, that our <hi>Entering into Life,</hi> and our <hi>continued remiſſion</hi> or Juſtification have not the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions? that thoſe Graces are excluded from one which belong to the other. Indeed the men that are for Faiths<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Inſtrumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, ſay ſomewhat to it; but what you can ſay, I know not. And for them, if they could prove Faith Inſtrumental in juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying <hi>co nomine,</hi> becauſe it receives Chriſt by whom we are juſtified; they would alſo prove it the Inſtrument of Glorify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becauſe it Receives Chriſt by and for whom we are ſaved and Glorified. And ſo if the Inſtrumentality of Faith muſt exclude obedience from juſtifying us, it muſt alſo exclude it from Glorifying us. And I marvel that they are ſo looſe and eaſie in admitting obedience into the work of ſaving, and yet not of continuing or conſummating Juſtification, when the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, <hi>By Grace ye are ſaved, by Faith,</hi>  and ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes obedience from Salvation in the general as much as he any where doth from Juſtification in particular.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. But laſtly, I take what you grant me in this Section, and profeſs that I think in effect you grant me the main of the cauſe that I ſtand upon. For, as you grant, 1. <hi>That faith is not the whole condition of the Covenant.</hi> 2. <hi>That Repentance alſo is the condition of Remiſſion</hi> (which is near the ſame with Juſtification.) 3. <hi>That obedience is the condition of Glorification</hi> (which hath the ſame conditions with final and continued Juſtification.) 4. So you ſeem to yield all this, as to <hi>our full juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation at Judgement.</hi> For you purpoſely limit the conditiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of meer faith to our <hi>Juſtification in this Life.</hi> But if you yield all that I deſire (as you do, if I underſtand you) as to the laſt juſtification at Judgement, then we are not much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering in this buſineſs. For I take (as Mr. <hi>Burges</hi> doth, <hi>Lect.</hi> of <hi>Juſtification</hi> 29<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) our compleateſt and moſt perfect Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be that at Judgement. Yea, and that it is ſo eminent and conſiderable here, that I think all other Juſtification is ſo called chiefly as referring to that. And me thinks above all men, you ſhould ſay ſo too, who make Juſtification to lie only <hi>in ſententi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> judicis,</hi> and not <hi>in ſententia Legis</hi>: And ſo all that go your way (as many that I meet with do.) If then we are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied at Gods great Tribunal at Judgement, by obedience as
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:60968:201"/>
the ſecondary part of the condition of the Covenant (which you ſeem to yield.) 1. We are agreed in the main. 2. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not yet believe that our Juſtification at that Bar hath one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and our Juſtification in Law (or in this Life, as conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued) another. He that dyeth juſtified, was ſo juſtified in the hour of dying, on the ſame conditions as he muſt be at Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For 1. There are no conditions to be performed after death. 2. <hi>Sententia Legis &amp; ſententia judicis</hi> do juſtifie on the ſame terms. Add to all this what I grant to you, <hi>[that our Juſtification when firſt begun here, is by faith (ſuppoſing Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance) before and without the practice of obedience,]</hi> and then ſee how near we are.</p>
                     <p>The fifth Argument which you mention is grounded on the common Maxim, <hi>Non eſt diſtinguendum ubi Lex non diſtinguit,</hi> and runs thus: If the Scripture in propounding to man the adaequate Object of juſtifying Faith, (Chriſt) do not divide Chriſt, and ſay, <hi>[In believing him to be a Prieſt, your faith is juſtifying, but not in believing him to be King, or Prophet, or Head,]</hi> but propoundeth Chriſt undivided as this Object; then muſt not we diſtinguiſh or divide, but take Chriſt entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the object of juſtifying Faith. But the Scripture doth not divide or diſtinguiſh in this caſe; therefore we muſt not. It is Chriſt that muſt be Received, and believed in: but a Saviour and not a King, is not Chriſt. It is Chriſt as Chriſt. His very Name ſignifieth as directly his Kingly office at leaſt, as his Prieſtly. And if you confeſs that the ſame act of Faith at the ſame inſtant Receives Chriſt both as Prieſt and King, then I ſhall ſtay my aſſent to your opinion till you bring me the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture that ſaith, <hi>it is faith in this notion; and not in that which juſtifies.</hi> God ſpeaks plainly that <hi>whoſoever believeth ſhall be juſtified from all things,</hi> &amp;c. And you confeſs this <hi>Believing</hi> is the <hi>Receiving Chriſt for King and Prieſt</hi>; and that it juſtifies as a condition; and doth not your (unproved) diſtinction over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw this again?</p>
                     <p>The ſixth Argument which you mention, runs thus: If Scripture particularly propound Chriſt as King, as the Object of juſtifying Faith, then Chriſt as King is the object of it: But Scripture doth ſo: <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi> I have named you ſome places where it ſo doth, a little before.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="376" facs="tcp:60968:202"/>The ſeventh is to the ſame purpoſe with the fifth. You name two Texts as proving that Scripture tyeth Juſtification to the Receipt of Chriſt as Prieſt only: But there is not a word in the Texts to that end. <hi>Rom</hi> 3.25. ſpeaks of Faith in Chriſts blood, but not a word for excluding Faith in his Obedience, Reſurrection, Interceſſion, or Power, much leſs excluding our conſent to his full Authority or Office. The word <hi>[Only]</hi> is not in the Text. You may as well ſay, that it is <hi>[only]</hi> by faith in his <hi>Name,</hi> and ſo not <hi>in his blood,</hi> becauſe other Texts ſay, <hi>it is by faith in his Name.</hi> See <hi>Acts</hi> 13.16. The other Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.9. ſpeaks neither a word of <hi>Faith,</hi> nor excludes Chriſts <hi>obedience</hi> (by <hi>which many are made Righteous</hi>) nor <hi>Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> (for <hi>he Roſe again for our Juſtification.</hi>) nor <hi>his Interceſſion,</hi> (<hi>for who ſhall condemn us? it is Chriſt that died, yea</hi> rather <hi>that Roſe again, and is even at the right hand of God, who alſo maketh Interceſſion for us,</hi> Rom. 8.34.) And all theſe parts of Chriſts Prieſtly Office muſt be excluded, if you will affix the word <hi>[Only]</hi> to the Text, which ſaith, <hi>we are juſtified by his blood.</hi> Indeed you make ſo a quick diſpatch in the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie about the active and paſſive Righteouſneſs.</p>
                     <p>The ſame anſwer ſerves to what you ſay in the eighth, and ninth, and tenth, being the ſame with that you ſay here. I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail how you would form an Argument from 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5 21. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.21 I Where you ſay, <hi>Obedience is not an eſſential part of Faith,</hi> I yield it willingly, taking Faith properly and ſtrictly, and not in the largeſt improper ſenſe. But that it juſtifies as immediatly as it Receiveth him as King, as it doth in Receiving him as Prieſt, I ſhall take for proved, till you prove the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs here of dividing Chriſt, and Faith, or diſtinguiſhing, and appropriating juſtifying to one reſpect, and excluding another in the ſame act of Believing, and the ſame Object Chriſt. And to what is ſaid before, let me yet add this, 1. If Chriſt be not received as a true compleat Saviour, except he be Received as King, then Faith juſtifies not as it Receiveth him for Prieſt only: (for you here confeſs that he juſtifies as he is Received as a Saviour.) But the Antecedent is evident: for as King he ſaveth <hi>his people from ſin and Satan,</hi> and all their enemies, <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="377" facs="tcp:60968:202"/>2. If Chriſt as King do juſtifie us, then he muſt be Received as King to Juſtification. But the former is undenyable, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. <hi>&amp;c. Ergo. &amp;c.</hi> The Conſequence is raiſed on your own Grounds.</p>
                     <p>The eleventh Argument (as you number) doth ſuppoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral points (very weighty with me, which I undertake to make good) which do overthrow the unſound grounds which the contrary minded go upon. 1. I ſuppoſe that Faith ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth principally <hi>ex Voluntate ordinantis,</hi> and not <hi>ex natura actus</hi>; though it have <hi>Aptioudinem ad officium in ipſa rei na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura.</hi> 2. I ſuppoſe Chriſt is firſt received by Faith, and his Benefits come with him, and in order of nature are after the Receiving of him. Theſe things being ſuppoſed, it ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſwades me, that the entertainment of Chriſt as King, was never intended by God to be excluded from the conditional Intereſt in Juſtification, when I find in Scripture that his own Dominion was an end of his Death, Reſurrection and Revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and that God doth ſo inſiſt on this point, to bring the world to ſubjection to Chriſt, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that the honouring and advancing of God the Father, and the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator God-man, is the moſt Noble excellent uſe of our faith. Is it then any whit probable that it is Gods meaning to exclude this reſpect of the act from any conditionality herein? Shall I again tell you the true ground of mens miſtake (as I think) in this Point? They look on Faith as if it were a natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, and did make the thing received theirs immediatly and formally, as it is ſuch a Receiving <hi>ex natura rei,</hi> and not as it is <hi>Receptio moralis</hi> whoſe effect depends wholly on, and its efficacy or Intereſt is derived directly from the Will, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution or Ordination of the Legiſlator and Donor, and ſo doth what it doth as a condition in Law-ſence. And I pray ſearch, whether in this Queſtion, you do not confound your Notions <hi>ex parte objecti,</hi> and <hi>ex parte Actus?</hi> Let me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all by the Illuſtration of my former ſimilitude. A wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man condemned for Treaſon, is Ranſomed by the Prince, who Decreeth, that if ſhe will Believe that he is her Redeemer, and will take him as her Maſter, Redeemer and Husband, ſhe ſhall be Delivered and made his Princeſs; elſe not. Now the
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:60968:203"/>
queſtion is, what is the condition of this womans deliverance and Dignity? Is the condition of her Deliverance and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, the taking him only under the Notion of a Pardoner or Deliverer? And is the condition of her Dignity, only the Taking him as a Prince who is Rich and Honourable? No. The condition on her part, is the Taking him entirely to all theſe uſes, or in all theſe Reſpects, and more: even the marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, and covenanting to be his, as a faithfull ſpouſe and Subject; and firſt acknowledging what he hath done for her freedom and advancement, then to take him for her Husband and Lord, that hath done this to advance and free her. And while ſhe is faithfull to this marriage covenant, in the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, ſhe ſhall enjoy theſe Benefits: but if ſhe forſake him and chooſe another, as with him ſhe received her Dignity, ſo with him ſhe ſhall loſe them all. So that <hi>ex parte actus</hi> here is no room for your <hi>quatenus</hi> and <hi>diſtinguiſhing.</hi> But now if the Queſtion be intended not <hi>ex parte Actus,</hi> or, what is the condition on her part, but only what is it in him that ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives for her Husband, which doth deliver her? Why then we ſay, it is his Ranſom, his love and free mercy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if the Queſtion be, what is it in him that dignifieth her? Why I ſay, it is his Dignity and Riches of which ſhe participateth; toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the ſame his free mercy as the Impulſive cauſe. And ſo ſhe is Dignified by Receiving or marrying him <hi>quatenus</hi> a Prince, rich and Honourable, and not <hi>quatenus</hi> a Redeemer on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and ſhe is delivered by taking him as a Deliverer or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, and not as an honourable Prince. The meaning of all this is no more, but that he doth not redeem her as a Prince, nor dignifie her under the notion of a Redeemer: and ſo on his part you may <hi>diſtinguiſh.</hi> But yet as to the conditionality on her part, there is no room for <hi>diſtinguiſhing</hi> at all. For is not this all that <hi>Paul</hi> ayms at in ſpeaking ſo oft of Faith in Relation to Chriſts death and Righteouſneſs, rather then to his Government? to note <hi>[what in Chriſt received doth juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie]</hi> rather then <hi>[what reſpect of our act of faith is the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?]</hi> And may not this tend to an accommodation between us in this Point? eſpecially with thoſe Divines that ſay, Faith is taken Relatively, when we are ſaid to be Juſtified by it; and
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:60968:203"/>
it is ſaid, to be Imputed to us for Righteouſneſs? The Lord enlighten our dark underſtandings, and give us love to the Truth and one another.</p>

                     <p>HAving done with this, I proceed to your Additional Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which I lately received, and for which I am alſo really thankfull to you. But the Anſwer needs not be long. 1. You think the 66. <hi>Theſ.</hi> hardly reconcilable with the words cited out of <hi>pag,</hi> 191 of that of Baptiſm, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25 &amp; 5.9.

<pb n="380" facs="tcp:60968:204"/>
Title from men, which was neceſſary to him that ſhould exerciſe the place of a Magiſtrate. 2. Chriſt ſpeaks not of <hi>Soveraignty</hi> (that he had:) but <hi>Magiſtracy</hi> (which is diſtinct from Soveraignty, as being the Executioner of Lawes, which Soveraignty makes, and being under the Law, when the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign <hi>qua talis</hi> is above them.) 3. His Interrogation may perhaps be no <hi>Negation.</hi> 4. But the plain anſwer which I ſtick to is this. Chriſt had not then a Title or Right to the actual exerciſe of his power, as to <hi>divide Inheritances.</hi> The General of an Army to ranſom a Souldier that ſhould dye for Treaſon, doth agree with the King, that he will put himſelf in the place of that common ſouldier for a months time, and will do all his duty, and will venture his life in ſome deſperate ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Now during this time while he is in the ſouldiers place, the General hath not title to the <hi>Actual Rule,</hi> &amp;c. as before he had: not becauſe he hath loſt it, but becauſe it will not ſtand with the ſtate and duty of a ſouldier which he hath volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily put himſelf in.

That ſuch a conditional Law or Covenant is granted, and exſtant in Scripture, is as plain as moſt points in the Goſpel: and ſure no ſuch thing can be but upon Chriſts death as the meritorious cauſe. 6. So interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe Texts which are ſo to be interpreted, is no evaſion: And no Text will prove Chriſts ſatisfaction and Merit wholly proper to the Elect. Much leſs thoſe which ſay, <hi>He died for all men,</hi> That God intendeth only the Elect to be certainly ſaved by Chriſts death, I can eaſily prove from many other Texts: But if I ſhould prove it by theſe, it were ſtrange. It is an ill conſequence <hi>[Chriſt died for all men; therefore his ſatisfaction is proper to the Elect.]</hi> 7. In point of Law the Elect have no more Title to Chriſt and his Benefits, then any others (as Elect before they believe.) But Gods <hi>Decree</hi> hath from Eternity appropriated Salvation by Chriſt only to the Elect in point of Event. He that determined <hi>de eventu,</hi> that only the Elect ſhould be ſaved by Chriſt, did yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>hink it the fitteſt way to his glorious ends to make Chriſts Death a <hi>ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſatisfaction for all,</hi> &amp; to make in his new Law a free deed of Gift of Chriſt, and all his Benefits to all that will receive him as he is offered: yet not engaging himſelf to publiſh this Law to every particular man; though it be of univerſal extent in the Tenor. The Promiſe names none as included; nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth any, but who do wilfully exclude themſelves. But theſe things require fuller opening.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Laſtly, <hi>[Chriſt dying loco noſtro]</hi> as you ſay, is a term that needs as great caution for the true underſtanding it, as moſt that we make uſe of.

to Gods Juſtice for the breach of his Law, both Father and Son (whoſe Will is one) agreeing or reſolving, that yet no man ſhould have actual Remiſſion or Salvation hereby, but on condition of receiving the Redeemer for their Lord and Saviour: and thus Chriſt died <hi>loco omnium</hi>: this is ſound Doctrine. That at the ſame time it was the ſecret Will or Eternal Decree of the Father; and the Will of the Mediator <hi>de eventu,</hi> to give effectually Grace to believe to his Choſen only; and conſequently that they only ſhould be actually ſaved, and thus he died only <hi>loco Electorum,</hi> is alſo ſound Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine.

                  <p>You here touch (very eaſily) on two Subjects. I will begin with the later, <hi>viz.</hi> Your four Arguments againſt my Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Juſtification by the Goſpel Grant or New Law. Your firſt is, that <hi>This is per reſultantiam; but Juſtification is an act of Will; but no Act of Will is by neceſſary Reſultancy</hi>] Anſwer. As it proceedeth from the <hi>Inſtrument</hi> or <hi>Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> it is by <hi>Reſultancy</hi>: As by that Inſtrument it is the Act of the <hi>Legiſlator</hi> or <hi>Principal Agent,</hi> ſo it is an Act of Will. It
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:60968:206"/>
was his Will at the enacting of the <hi>Grant,</hi> and ſtill is his <hi>Will,</hi> that this his <hi>Grant,</hi> or <hi>Deed of Gift</hi> ſhould <hi>mora<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ffecius hos vel illos producore,</hi> at ſuch a diſtance upon ſuch and ſuch conditions. The Act and Effect of the Law, or Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is the Act and Effect of the Legiſlator and Teſtator, whoſe Inſtrument it is: But the ſaid Law or Teſtament doth not <hi>efficaciter agere,</hi> or produce theſe effects, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> the time that the conditions are performed: (for it is the Nature of a Moral condition to be added for the ſuſpenſion of the Effect or event of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> till it be performed.) Therefore the Rector, Donor or Teſtator doth not <hi>efficaciter agere</hi> till then. And therefore he acteth by that his Inſtrument then, or not at all If you give by Deed or by Will<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In the Propoſitions againſt Mr. <hi>Bedford,</hi> you might have ſeen this diſpelled. For <hi>Adoption,</hi> I yield the whole.

given by a written <hi>Pardon</hi> or <hi>Grant,</hi> from whence the Right to it, and the Benefit it ſelf, do immediately reſult (being indeed but one thing, except my underſtanding be too groſs to diſtinguiſh them.) If therefore you had ſaid as you ſhould, that <hi>Right</hi> to Glory and to Sanctity (ſo far as that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant giveth it) are beſtowed without any other Act, (except finall Judgement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is neceſſary to full Juſtification as well as Glory) I ſhould yield you all.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To your third, <hi>[That the Covenant juſtifies but conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally, therefore not actually.]</hi> I anſwered before: for it was one of your former Arguments. <hi>Conditio eſt Lex addita ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotio quae donec praeſtetur eventum ſuſpendit,</hi> ſaith <hi>Cujacius.</hi> And as <hi>Mynſinger</hi> ſaith, <hi>Ne<expan>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.) So that it is the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the condition to ſuſpend the effect, but not to make the cauſe to be no cauſe. Indeed if the Condition be never performed, then it deſtroyes or prevents the effect, and ſo the Inſtrument doth not <hi>agere:</hi> And why? but becauſe it was the Will of the Agent that it ſhould act ſo, and on ſuch terms, or elſe not: ſo that the non-performance doth not undo what the Inſtrument did, nor doth it diſoblige the Author, but it mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſteth that he was never obliged: (they are <hi>Grotius</hi> words.) I conclude therefore that when the condition is performed, then the Inſtrument or conditional Grant doth begin <hi>verè agere &amp; donar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="4">4. Your fourth alſo is one of thoſe which you have in the Beginning, where I have anſwered it. <hi>The Covenant</hi> you ſay, <hi>is an Act paſt; and ſo not continued, and ſo the Juſtification by it paſt, and not continued, &amp;c.</hi>] Anſwer. The <hi>Phyſical</hi> Act of Legiſlation or Covenant granting is paſt but this only makes it an <hi>Inſtrument,</hi> able and fit to produce ſuch and ſuch effects, and not actually to produce them at that preſent, when it is conditional. But the Moral action of this Law or Covenant is not paſt, but continued. The Law or Covenant is not
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:60968:207"/>
out of Date. And therefore it continueth ſtill to juſtifie. The making of our Laws, are Acts paſt by Parliaments long ago, and ſo not continued. Will you therefore conclude that the Moral Agency or Efficiency of theſe Laws is paſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they do not condemn or juſtifie? I know no ground that can bear your concluſions, except with <hi>Riſhworth (Dialog)</hi> and ſuch other of the more impudent Papiſts, one ſhould vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Scripture, and ſay, that they were only Miſcellaneous occaſional writings, and never intended to be <hi>Gods Law,</hi> or our <hi>Rule of Faith and Life</hi>: but I believe you will never come to that.

O happy Diſputers that are not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried head-long into extreams by the ſpirit of Contradiction! What more proper to the reformed Religion, as ſuch, then to honour the Scriptures?

                  <p n="3">3. And if Dr. <hi>W.</hi> had ſpoak of Sanctification, are there not multitudes of our own beſt approved Divines, that make all theſe acts to be found in men by way of preparation before Sanctification? Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> of <hi>Dedham</hi> in his Treat. of faith: Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> in his Epiſt. before that book, and oſt in his own book, affirmeth not only a common preparatory contrition, Hungring and thirſting, Hope, Love, Joy, but even effectual ſpecial Vocation it ſelf, and ſo faith to go before Sanctification and Juſtification. And indeed what man denyeth it? except
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:60968:208"/>
Mr. <hi>Pemble</hi> and a very few that with him make Sanctification and Vocation to be all one? which how far I approve my ſelf, I have ſhewed in Tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="4">4. But look into the words, and find out what error you can! Which of thoſe acts do you think goes not before Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication? And if they go before, ſure you will not deny but they do ſome way or other diſpoſe or fit a man for pardon: or elſe God would not have preſcribed them before it. 1. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick faith is the Belief of the Catholick Doctrine. I am ſure you take that to go before Juſtification. 2. If Hope of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don go not before, then Affiance (to which Hope is eſſential) goes not before: Yea, then Believers do deſpair in the Act of Believing to Juſtification. 3. I never knew the man that doubted whether fear of Puniſhment went before. 4. The ſame I may ſay of grief for ſin. 5. And if all the doubt be of <hi>Purpoſe againſt ſin, and for Amendment,</hi> 1. Sure they that ſay <hi>Repentance</hi> is pre-requiſite to juſtification, will not exclude a <hi>Purpoſe of Amendment.</hi> 2. And ſure thoſe that ſay Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and Vocation are all one, and go before Juſtification will hardly exclude it. 3. They that take a turning from Idols to the true God, as the end, to be in order before a Turning from Infidelity to the Mediator as the way, which is by Faith; theſe muſt needs think that ſo much of <hi>Actual</hi> Amendment goes before Juſtification <hi>(ye believe in God, believe alſo in me.)</hi> 4. They that ſay, <hi>Faith alone juſtifieth, but not the faith which is alone,</hi> will ſurely include this <hi>Purpoſe</hi> as Antecedent. <hi>Dave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> &amp;c. expreſs it, and inſiſt on it. Dr. <hi>Twiſs</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth works <hi>Media &amp; cauſae diſpoſitivae:</hi> But it were endleſs to cite Authors in this Point. 5. But I tell you my mind. I take this Purpoſe of obeying Chriſt <hi>de futuro</hi> to be very Faith it ſelf. For faith is a Covenant reception of Chriſt, and to take him for Chriſt and King-Redeemer, and to Purpoſe, yea Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to obey him, are but one thing. And therefore a Giving up our ſelves as Redeemed-ſubjects, and ſo a purpoſe of being actually ſubject, are faith it ſelf. And then they muſt needs be prerequiſite to Juſtification. So that whether you take theſe Acts for common or ſpecial, ſuely they go before Juſtification
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:60968:209"/>
as Dr. <hi>Ward</hi> ſaith. Dare you tell any man of yout Hearers that though he have not ſo much as a Purpoſe to mend, yet he is juſtified by Faith? Truly ſuch paſſages haue embittered the minds of Papiſts, and many weak ones againſt our Doctrine of Juſtification: and given great advantage to the <hi>Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For what you ſay of contradicting Dr. <hi>Downam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> and Mr. <hi>Pemble</hi>; I anſwer, 1. Though they differ between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the point of Juſtification, and one hath wrote a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of the others Doctrine, yet you will never ſhew me wherein this ſpeech of Dr. <hi>Ward</hi> doth contradict either of them. Indeed if Dr. <hi>Ward</hi> had determined whether he meant common Diſpoſitions or ſpecial, perhaps he might have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted one of them, they do ſo far differ themſelves. For you know Mr. <hi>Pemble</hi> not only in his <hi>Vindic. Grat.</hi> but even in the place you cite (<hi>pag.</hi> 42.43.) takes thoſe Acts to be of ſpecial Grace, or a part of Sanctification, which moſt Divines do judge to be preparatory thereto. And for my part, I judge as Mr. <hi>Pemble,</hi> if you take but that point in to qualifie it, which I have aſſerted <hi>Treat. of Reſt,</hi> ſecond <hi>Edit. part</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. that the ſincerity of Grace as ſaving<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lyeth not in the bare nature of the Act, but in the prevailing degree which Morality may ſpecifie, then I ſay as Mr. <hi>Pemble,</hi> pag. 43. that theſe Vertues which are (many of them by our Divines) reckoned as Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions to Regeneration, are if they be true, the main parts and fruits of Regeneration.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But I admire how you ſhould think that ſpeech of Dr. <hi>Wards</hi> ſhould be a joining with the Papiſts againſt Dr. <hi>Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name</hi> and Mr. <hi>Pemble,</hi> when <hi>Downame</hi> tells you that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts diſpute of another ſubject then we do; while they mean one thing by it, <hi>viz</hi> Sanctification, and we another: (upon which ground Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> is ready to throw out the Diſpute, as being about one Term, but different ſubjects.) And Mr. <hi>Pemble</hi> anſwers [<hi>that the Argument of</hi> Bellarmine <hi>from that chapter of the Councils ſixth ſeſſ. is framed on the Error which puts out of frame the whole Diſpute,</hi> viz. <hi>that Regeneration and Sanctification is all one thing with Juſtification, and that to juſtifie a ſinner is nothing elſe but to do away inherent corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

No man that I know doth ſeem to come nearer you then Dr. <hi>Downame</hi> in placing juſtifying faith in Aſſent, and ſo not taking it to contain ſo many acts: And yet even he tells you, that <hi>[the act of the Will doth concur to Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that faith which a habit of the mind, is ſeated as well in the Will as in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding: and this is confeſſed by Farthers, Schoolmen, and the modern Doctors of the Romiſh Church.] Treat. of Juſtif.</hi> pag. 358.359. Yea for ought I can underſtand he extended faith as far as I, and meant as I do herein, <hi>pag.</hi> 348.349 352. he ſaith, [<hi>By the former which is a bare Aſſent, we do after a ſort</hi> Credere Chriſtum, <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him to be the Saviour of theſe that believe in him: By the latter, which is the lively and effectual Aſſent working on the Heart, we do</hi> credere in Chriſtum, <hi>and receive him to be our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, whereupon neceſſarily followeth Affiance in Chriſt, and love of him as a Saviour. Thus then by a true Belief we receive and Embrace Chriſt, in our judgement by a lively Aſſent: in our</hi> Hearts, <hi>deſiring earneſtly to be partakers of him (which De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire we expreſs by our Prayer,) and in our Wills reſolving to</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and Profeſs <hi>him to be our only Saviour, and to reſt upon him alone for Salvation. So that a true lively and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al faith is the work of the whole ſoul: that is to ſay, as well of the Heart as of the Mind,</hi> Rom 10.10 Act. 16.14. Act. 8.37.] ſo far Dr. <hi>Downame.</hi> Is not this as much as I ſay? and the very ſame? I only mention him (having many more at hand) becauſe 1. you urge him, and 2. I conjecture, you think you

go his way about the nature of faith. If this be not as much as I ſay do but add what he ſaith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>pag.</hi> 15. and I think you have as much: (in this particular.) [<hi>The true meaning</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of the Queſtion [whether we are juſtified by Faith or by Works?] is not as oppoſing the inward Grace of Faith to the outward acts of Obedience, which indeed a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And truly Sir, I uſe to charge my conſcience to enquire what may be the plain meaning of a Text, and to embrace that, and not againſt Light to be carryed by prejudice: and this conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence tells me that this Reſolution of Dr. <hi>Downame</hi> being ſo plainly agreeable to <hi>Paul,</hi> is not to be rejected. When I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially, conſider what <hi>Paul</hi> driveth at, my Judgement tells me that it was never his intent to advance any one ſimple Act of the ſoul into the office of juſtifying, excluding all the reſt; but to advance Chriſt againſt mens own works which ſtood up then in competition with him: And that <hi>Paul</hi> never meant that Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Juſtifies, but not <hi>Velle, Acceptare, Conſentire, Elig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Suppoſe there be a mortal Diſeaſe that hath ſeized on a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which no man can cure but one only Phyſitian: nor he but by a Medicine that will coſt him as much as the lives of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens are worth: This Phyſitian comes and ſends to them, and offers then all without exception, that if they will but take him for their Phyſitian and truſt him with their lives, he will not only manifeſt his skill, that he is able to cure them, but he will do it, and pay for the Phyſick, and not put them to pay a penny. Hereupon ſome that are his enemies, and ſome that are miſtaken in the man upon falſe reports, and ſome that judge of him by his outward appearance, do all conclude, [this is ſome Deceiver, he is not able to do any ſuch matter; none but fools will truſt him, and venture their lives in his hand: Let us ſtir about and labour and we ſhall overcome it, and do well enough.] On the contrary the Phyſitian, having great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on the poor deluded people, knowing their caſe better then themſelves, and having already bought the remedy for
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:60968:210"/>
them, doth ſend to them again, to tell them all, that thoſe that will believe him and truſt him, he will certainly cure, and the reſt ſhall dye every man of them, for all they think to labour it away. I pray you now put our Queſtions here impartially: 1. Is believing and truſting the Phyſitian ſome one ſingle act, excluding all others? Or was it ever his intent to advance ſome one act of theirs? 2. Would it not be a learned madneſs to diſpute whether the Phyſitian make the act of Aſſent, or the act of Willing only: or Accepting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or Affiance, or Recum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bency to be the Healing act; and of what faculty that act was which muſt heal them? 3. Is it the Truſting and Receiving him only 1. as one that hath brought a Remedy: 2. Or as one that can and will cure us by it: or 3. Alſo as one that muſt be obeyed in the uſe of that remedy for the effecting the cure; which of theſe is it that he intends muſt be the Object of their Act? 4. Doth [Truſting him and Believing him] exclude a Reſolution to obey his Directions and the future actual obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience? Surely no: it includeth both: But it excludeth both their truſting any other Phyſitian, and their thinking to work away the Diſeaſe and cure themſelves. 5 Doth Truſting or Believing him cure theſe men as the Inſtrument? or is it only a condition without which he will not cure them? But this Queſtion with you I may ſpare.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, You queſtion, [<hi>How I will avoid</hi> Tompſons <hi>opinion of the Interciſion of Juſtification upon the committing a ſin that waſts the conſcience, when I make Juſtification a continued Act upon condition of obedience.?</hi>] <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Do you not diſcern that the Queſtion concerneth you and every man, as much as me? and that it is of aequal difficulty upon your own and others opinion, as upon mine? Dr. <hi>Downame</hi> will tell you as well as I, that Juſtification is a continued Act. So will Dr. <hi>Twiſs,</hi> and all that with him do take it for an Immanent Act. Your ſelf, who take it for a tranſient act but once performed, do yet judge (I doubt not,) that our Juſtified eſtate which is the effect of it is permanent: and the relations of Reconciled, Pardoned, Adopted, are continued. Alſo you and they, I hope, will confeſs, that Juſtification paſſive is continued on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of continued faith. Now I would know how you will
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:60968:211"/>
avoid <hi>Tompſons</hi> Doctrine of Interciſion, upon every notable defect of a Chriſtians faith, when unbelief gives him a foyl, which is too common? as you anſwer, ſo will I. If you ſay his faith is not overcome habitually, when unbelief is prevalent in the preſent Act, I will ſay ſo of his obedience. 2. You know moſt Divines ſay as much as I, that obedience is a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the continuance of Juſtification, (only they ſay that faith only is the Inſtrument of Juſtifying,) and how will they anſwer you? 3. You know that all ſay, that obedience is a condition of Salvation, and ſo of our preſent Title to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Now how will they avoid <hi>Tompſons</hi> Doctrine of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of that Title to Salvation, upon the committing of ſuch ſins? 4. It is not perfect obedience which I ſay is the condition, but ſincere: And by ſincere I mean ſo much as may expreſs that we unfeignedly take Chriſt ſtill for our Lord and Saviour: And ſo it is not every ſin that I ſay will forfeit or interrupt our Juſtification and cauſe it to diſcontinue, (that is, loſe our Title, or change our Relation in Law:) no nor every groſs ſin: but only that ſin which is inconſiſtent with the continued Accepting Chriſt for our Soveraign: that ſin which breaks the main Covenant, (of which ſee Dr. <hi>Preſton</hi> at large,) as Adultery or Deſertion doth in marriage: A deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God to be our God, or Chriſt to be our Chriſt, by our works, while we confeſs him in word: An actual explicite or implicite Renunciation of Chriſt, and taking the fleſh for our maſter, and the pleaſing of it for our happineſs; or as the <hi>Mahometans</hi> following a falſe Chriſt. Now, I hope that no juſtified perſon doth ever commit this ſin: much leſs any elect and juſtified man, of whom <hi>Tompſon</hi> ſpeaks. You may ſee through his ninth <hi>chap. part</hi> 2 that <hi>Tompſon</hi> erred through miſunderſtanding wherein the ſincerity of Faith as juſtifying doth conſiſt: (I wiſh many more do not ſo.) He thought that Juſtification did follow every act of undiſſembled Faith; but only rooted Faith would certainly perſevere; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the unrooted (Though true Believers) might loſe their Juſtification, if they were Reprobates (<hi>Praſcits</hi> as he calls them,) or have it interrupted, if they were elect. But if he had known (what I have aſſerted in the aforeſaid <hi>cap.</hi> 11. <hi>part</hi> 3.
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:60968:211"/>
of <hi>Reſt, Edit.</hi> 2.) that the very ſincerity of faith as juſtifying, lyeth not in the natural being of the act meerly, but the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent Degree and moral ſpecification, then he would have known, that his <hi>unrooted</hi> ones were never juſtified, &amp; therefore never loſt it. And if in aſſerting juſtification by the only act of Faith, he had not over-looked the uſe of the habit, he had not ſpoke ſo much of Interciſion of Juſtification, through in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption of the acts, where the Habits remain.

I would know 1. whether we are Guilty (not only <hi>facti, ſed poenae</hi>) of every ſin we commit? or of ſuch ſins as <hi>Davids,</hi> before Repentance? if not guilty: then what need of Pardon, of daily praying Forgive us our Debts, or of a Chriſt to procure our Pardon?

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE <hi>Reader</hi> muſt underſtand that ſince the Writing of this, I have endeavoured to clear this point in my Directions for Peace of Conſcience. To which now I add but this, that beſides a Plenary Guilt or Remiſſion, there ſeems to be a Guilt and Remiſſion that are both but imperfect and of a middle ſort: that is, that as in <hi>Peters</hi> act of ſin, the habit of faith remained, ſo with his Guilt, a <hi>ſtate</hi> of Juſtification remained: As none of his old ſins returned on him, ſo the Covenant of Grace upon his Habitual Faith did hinder the Guilt from being Plenary or fixed, by beginning a Remiſſion; I fear not to call it an imperfect Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion: The Law doth pronounce Death on a man for every ſin, &amp; it is ſo far in force as to determine that <hi>Death is both deſerved and due to this man for this ſin.</hi> But at the ſame inſtant, though after in order of nature, the Goſpel that giveth pardon to Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, doth give an Imperfect pardon to <hi>David, Peter</hi> and ſuch Habitual Believers as ſoon as they ſin, before Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for that ſin be actuall; and their Pardon will become ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary when they actually Repent and Believe. Their Sin is like the fault of a Kings Son or Subject, that in a Paſſion ſhould ſtrike the King, when yet Habitually he hath a loving Loyal heart to him. He deſerveth Death, and by Law it may be his due; but he is a Son ſtill, and the King will not take this advantage againſt him, though he will not fully pardon him, till he ſubmit and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment his Fault. We are ſtill the Children of God, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe ſins that go againſt the Habitual bent of our Hearts (for thats the Tryal;) but muſt have actual Faith and Repentance before we ſhall have full pardon: Whether you will call that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don which the Promiſe giveth upon meer habitual Repentance, <hi>A vertual Pardon,</hi> and that which it giveth on actual Repentance, <hi>an actual Pardon;</hi> or what name you will give it, I leave to conſideration; but compleat it is not in a caſe of heynous ſin, till Actual Repentance: Though it may be in a caſe of ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known,
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:60968:213"/>
unobſerved or forgotten infirmities. For the full condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is neceſſary to a full Pardon. He is near the caſe of a man that hath a Pardon granted him for Murder, but for want of ſome action to be performed, he hath not yet poſſeſſion of it, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not yet plead it. If you ask me what ſhould become of ſuch a man, if he ſo die before Repentance; I anſwer. <hi>1.</hi> I think it is a caſe that will never fall out: For <hi>1.</hi> God is as it were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged by Love and Promiſe, and by giving his indwelling Spirit to Believers, to bring them to Repentance. <hi>2.</hi> The new Nature or Disposition of ſuch a man will not ſuffer him to be long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Actual Repentance, at leaſt in ſome meaſure; eſpecially when Death ſhall look him in the fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e. I doubt not but <hi>David</hi> did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent before <hi>Nathan</hi> ſpoak to him; but God would not wake up with ſo ſhort and ſecret a Repentance for ſo great and odious a Crime. <hi>2.</hi> But if you can prove it profitable for ſuch a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> to be ſuddenly cut off before Repentance, and that ſuch a thing will be, I ſhould incline to think that he will be fully pardoned at the inſtant of Death, and ſo ſaved; becauſe the Lord knoweth that he repented Habitually and vertually, and would have done it actually, if he had had time for conſideration. <hi>3.</hi> Or if we ſhould conclude that God hath purpoſely left men of ſuch a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle condition, without any certainty how he will deal with them, that ſo no man may be encouraged to ſin, and in Impudency, I think it no dangerous Doctrine, nor injurious to the Body of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Truth. And thus I have now (many years ſince the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the foregoing Papers) told you in brief what ſatisfieth me concerning this difficult point, for the reconciling of the guilt of every particular ſin, eſpecially the more haynous, with the Doctrine of perſevering, uninterrupted Juſtification.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> PUT theſe two Queſtions together for brevity and Elucidation of the Matter in doubt; for ſo in effect they are but One<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> avoiding all unneceſſary Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of terms concerning which we are agreed; it is but little that I have need to ſay for your underſtanding of the ſenſe of the Queſtion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is here ſuppoſed that <hi>Paul</hi> doth maintain Juſtification by Faith, and oppoſeth it to Juſtification
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:60968:215"/>
by the works of the Law: and ſo oppoſeth Salvation by Grace and by works. 2. It is ſuppoſed that <hi>non datur tertium,</hi> there is no middle way of Juſtification beſides theſe two, <hi>by faith,</hi> or <hi>by Works</hi>: and therefore whatſoever Acts we are here juſtified by, it muſt needs follow, that thoſe Acts are none of the <hi>[Works]</hi> that <hi>Paul</hi> here ſpeaketh of as excluded: and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Acts are excluded are none of the <hi>Faith,</hi> by which <hi>Paul</hi> telleth us here that we are juſtified. This we are agreed on, and ſo it is often preſſed by my Opponents that there is no third way; which I grant them. But note that I do not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore grant them that there is no <hi>tertium,</hi> or other act either im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in <hi>Faith,</hi> or <hi>ſubſervient to it</hi> in that <hi>way</hi> of Juſtification that is by <hi>Faith</hi>: It was never <hi>Pauls</hi> meaning to exclude all other Gracious Acts relating to Chriſt, no not from this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Juſtification, as attendants on Faith, or modifications of it, implyed in it, or ſubſervient to it, And therefore it will not follow that any third thing by which we are thus juſtified, is either <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Works</hi>; but only that is not <hi>Works,</hi> becauſe they are excluded.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I put the Phyſical Act whoſe Unity we ſpeak of, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiſtinction to one moral Fact, which may contain many Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Acts: ſuch as Marriage, which is one in a civil or moral ſenſe, but many Phyſical Acts: and ſuch as almoſt all Contracts be; as taking a man to be my Prince, my Commander, my Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, my Phyſician, my Councellor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which every one of them contain many Phyſical acts.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There is a fourfold Unity here to be diſcerned, that the term <hi>[One]</hi> may be underſtood. 1. A general Unity, and this is not it in queſtion. We are agreed that <hi>in genere actus,</hi> and <hi>in genere actus ſecundi,</hi> and <hi>in genere actus immanentis,</hi> Faith is but <hi>One.</hi> 2. A Unity of the loweſt <hi>Genus,</hi> and the <hi>ſuperi</hi> or <hi>ſpecies.</hi> 3. A Unity of the <hi>ſpecies ſpecialiſſima.</hi> 4. A <hi>Numerical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity.</hi> Our Queſtion is of the third: but yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>ſecond</hi> and <hi>fourth</hi> are alſo controverted, I ſhall ſpeak of them before I come to the Queſtion. And concerning the <hi>fourth</hi> I Aſſert, that [<hi>The Faith which</hi> Paul <hi>oppoſeth to Works in the Point of Juſtification, is not only one numerical Act of the Soul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="403" facs="tcp:60968:215"/>My Opponents in this (though they are unwilling to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the oppoſition) muſt needs be all thoſe that ſay, Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is <hi>ſimul &amp; ſemel,</hi> at once and but once, and that it is a good Argument againſt any acts or works after Faith that <hi>[They exiſt not till we are juſtified, therefore they are no conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our Juſtification:]</hi> and all thoſe that deny and ſcorn the diſtinction between 1. Our Juſtification at the firſt (or putting us into a juſtified ſtate) 2. And our daily Juſtification by the continuation of that ſtate. 3. And our frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterated particular Juſtification from the Guilt of particular ſins. 4. And our final Juſtification by the ſentence of the Judge. Eſpecially by denying the ſecond, they muſt needs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny my Aſſertion, as ſhall be ſhewed anon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. <hi>If</hi> Paul <hi>ſpeak not only of Juſtification as begun, but as continued, then the Faith which he oppoſeth to works is not only one numerical Act.</hi> (For there muſt needs go ſome other Numerical Act before it, or elſe the perſon could not be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by faith before) But the <hi>Antecedent is true,</hi> as I prove from <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.18, 19. and <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. If <hi>Paul</hi> prove Juſtification by faith, from the inſtance of <hi>Abrahams</hi> believing after that he was juſtified, then he ſpeaketh not only of Juſtification as begun (or of our firſt Being juſtified) But the Antecedent is plain in the Text compared with <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. and 13 and 14. and 15. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was a juſtified man before he believed the Promiſe of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>'s having a Son.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 2 <hi>If a true Believer have a juſtifying Faith af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his firſt Juſtification, even as long as he liveth, then the Faith which</hi> Paul <hi>oppoſeth to works is not only one numerical Act</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that firſt Numerical Act doth not continue with us.) <hi>But the Antecedent is true,</hi> as appeareth 1. from the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Inſtance of <hi>Abraham.</hi> 2, From the neceſſity of a continued <hi>Active</hi> Juſtification: For the <hi>Paſſive</hi> elſe would ceaſe, and we ſhould be unjuſtified. If God did not continue to forgive us, and ſtill actively repute us juſt, and accept us as juſt and impute Righteouſneſs to us, and his Goſpel-Grant did not continually juſtifie us, (as every <hi>Fundamentum</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually cauſeth the Relation,) we ſhould ceaſe to be juſtified: And Gods active Juſtification continueth not without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:60968:216"/>
of mans Actual or Habitual Faith: Otherwiſe he ſhould juſtifie an Infidel, and he ſhould juſtifie afterwards in another way, and on other terms then he did at firſt. 3. From the continued Efficacy of Chriſts Merits, Interceſſion and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, which daily juſtifie us. So that he that ſaith, that he was never juſtified but once at one moment, and by one nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical Act of Faith, muſt ſay that Chriſt was his Juſtifier actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally but for a moment, and that he will not be beholden to him to juſtifie him any more.</p>
                  <p>And yet that no man may have a pretence of quarrelling about meer words, that hath a mind to it, let it ſtill be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, that as the word [Juſtification] is uſed to ſignifie the firſt making a man juſt that was unjuſt (relatively or qualita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,) So I confeſs that God, that Chriſt, that the Covenant do juſtifie us Univerſally but once (though particularly from particular ſins often) And thus it is but one Act of Faith by which we are juſtified Relatively, and not the Habit at all. But as Juſtification is taken for the ſame Act continued (though the mutation on us be not <hi>ab eodem termino</hi>) ſo we are juſtified every moment, and have a juſtifying faith conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, and are juſtified by the Habit, at leaſt as much as by the Act; and in ſome reſpect more. The Sun doth as truly Illuminate our part of the world all day after, as at Sun riſing, and by the ſame Action or Emanation in kind: But as <hi>Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating</hi> is taken for turning night into day, or illuminating the dark world from its darkneſs, ſo it doth only illuminate it from break of day to Sun riſing. Your Leaſe of your houſe or Land doth firſt make you a Tenant of no<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Tenant at the firſt ſealing and delivering: but it may by the ſame ſort of action conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue your Right till it expire, and ſo continue you a Tenant; And thus we are continually juſtified by God, by Chriſt, by the Covenant and by Faith.</p>
                  <p>Now as to the ſecond kind or matter of Unity (of an <hi>Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Genus and Superior ſpecies</hi>;) this is two-fold. 1. As the Acts of mans ſoul are ſpecified and denominated from the <hi>Faculties</hi> or <hi>Powers</hi>: or (if any deny that real diſtinction of faculties) from the Objects of Intellection, Volition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally conſidered. 2. As the acts of the ſoul are ſpecified
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:60968:216"/>
by their <hi>ſpecial Objects</hi> (though not <hi>ſpeciei ſpecialiſſimae.</hi>) As to the former, the queſtion is one of theſe two (which you will in terms, for they are one in ſenſe) <hi>Whether the act of Faith which</hi> Paul <hi>oppoſeth to works in Juſtification, be only an act of the Intellect, or only an act of the Will?</hi> Or, <hi>Whether it have only Entity and Verity, or only Goodneſs for its Object?</hi> And in the ſecond caſe the Queſtion is this, <hi>Whether God alone, or Chriſt alone, or the Promiſe alone, or Pardon or Righteouſneſs alone, or Heaven alone</hi> &amp;c. <hi>be the Object of that Faith which</hi> Paul <hi>oppoſeth to works in Juſtification.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the thing intended in our Queſtion is <hi>de ſpecie ſpecialiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſima, Whether it be but one ſpecial act which</hi> Paul <hi>oppoſeth to works in Juſtification.</hi> Here are three more Propoſitions that I ſhall handle in order, though the laſt only be neceſſary to me.</p>
                  <p>Propoſition 2. <hi>The Faith which</hi> Paul <hi>oppoſeth to works in Juſtification, is not only an Act of the Intellect, nor only of the Will.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall ſay but little of this, becauſe I have among Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants but few Adverſaries. The Papiſts indeed ſeat it in the Intellect only: and ſo doth <hi>Camero</hi> (calling it a Perſwaſion) and ſome few Proteſtants: ſome few others (as <hi>Ameſius</hi> ſometimes) place it only in the Will, and take Aſſent to be but a preſuppoſed Act: and they call it Affiance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or (as <hi>Ameſius</hi>) alſo <hi>Election, Acceptance,</hi> or <hi>Conſent,</hi> or embracing, or Recumbency, or ſuch like. <hi>Pemble</hi> taking Truth and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be all one, and the Underſtanding and Will for all one, takes alſo Aſſent and Affiance for all one; but I ſhall go on the ſuppoſition that his ſingular opinion is commonly diſallowed; however the <hi>Scotiſts,</hi> and many others deny the real Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Faculties. The common Vote of Proteſtant Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines is, that Faith is in both Faculties, the Intellect and Will, and hath for its object the Entity of Chriſts perſon, and the Verity of the Goſpel, and the goodneſs of Chriſt and his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits offered, which Faith accepteth. <hi>Davenants</hi> Words are plain and true, <hi>Determ.</hi> Qu. 38. pag. 174. <hi>In actu fidei juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantis tota anima ſe convertit ad cauſam juſtificantem: And</hi> qu. 37. pag. 166. <hi>Fides illa quam Scriptura agnoſcit ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet

in ſe complicatum actum Voluntatis &amp; Intellectus — Ne<expan>
                           <am>
                              <g ref="char:abque"/>
                           </am>
                           <ex>que</ex>
                        </expan> nobis abſurdum, ſed valde conſentaneum videtur actum illum quo tota anima purificatur &amp; juſtificatur ad totam animam pertine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re; ita ut in nudo intellectu habeat initium; in voluntate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plementum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Argument 1. <hi>The Object of this Faith is both Truth and Goodneſs:</hi> Therefore it is the act both of the Intellect and the Will. That Truth is the Object of it is evident, 1. In that the Metaphyſical Verity of Chriſts perſon is the Object of it, or elſe Chriſt were not the Object of it. 2. In that the moral Verity of the Goſpel, 1. as revealing Chriſt, 2. as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing pardon, is the object of it, as is confeſt, and the Scripture doth ſo plentifully declare, that it were ſuperfluous to cite the words.</p>
                  <p>That goodneſs is the object of it, appeareth, 1. In that Chriſt as Redeemer, Mediator, Saviour, is the object of it, and that is, Chriſt as neceſſary and good to us. It is Chriſt for our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, Juſtification and Salvation: and ſo under the formal notion of good. 2. In that it is a Promiſe as a Promiſe (Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Grant, or Deed of Gift) that is the Object by it. And it is Eſſential to theſe to be good to us as well as True: and the Truth is but for the good. 3. In that it is Pardon, Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Life eternal finally, that are the object of it; which as ſuch, and as offered to us, are good. If I thought theſe things needed proof, I would give you more.</p>
                  <p>Argument 2. <hi>The Scripture revealeth to us that this Faith is the Act both of the Intellect and the Will, therefore it is ſo.</hi> That it is the act of the Intellect, is ſo plain in Scripture, that I ſhould accuſe my ſelf of wearying you with needleſs work, if I ſhould go about to prove it. The Papiſts are right enough in thus much: and Dr. <hi>Downame de Juſtific.</hi> and againſt <hi>Pemble</hi> in <hi>Append. to Covenant of Grace,</hi> hath proved it at large. That it is an act of the Will, our Divines have fully proved againſt the Papiſts in many a full Diſcourſe; 1. From the ſenſe of <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>&amp;</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie Affiance, and ſuch an Affiance as is the act of the Will as well as of the Intellect. 2. Becauſe the Scripture often putteth
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:60968:217"/>
                     <hi>[Willing]</hi> as equipollent to Believing; in <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.17. <hi>Whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> Will, <hi>let him take the water of Life freely</hi>] where <hi>Willing</hi> and <hi>Taking</hi> are both acts of the Will, and the faith in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſo in other places. 3. The Scripture calleth it by the name of <hi>Receiving</hi> Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.6. which is the Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance or conſent of the Will. 4. The Scripture often makes Faith to be the Internal covenanting and cloſure of the heart with Chriſt, which is the act of the Will; and therefore it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwadeth with the Will to this end; and accuſeth men as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing, and calleth them Refuſers, Neglecters, Slighters, Rejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Deſpiſers of Chriſt, that are Unbelievers (privatively.) I trouble you not to cite the Texts as being needleſs, and done by many. Beſides that (as in the former Argument) the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, Chriſt, Pardon, Life, and other good things, as good, are frequently made the Object of Faith.</p>
                  <p>Argument 3. <hi>The Veracity of God is the formal Object of Faith. But the Veracity of God is his Goodneſs (or partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pateth at leaſt as much of his Goodneſs as of his Wiſdom and his Power:) therefore the Goodneſs of Good is the formal Object of Faith: and conſequently it is an act of the Will. God cannot lye, becauſe he is perfectly good, wiſe and Powerfull.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But (ſay ſome Papiſts) <hi>All theſe acts that you mention here, are Love and not Faith: Faith doth but aſſent, and Love con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth or accepteth.</hi>

Though ſometimes in other caſes the Apoſtle diſtinguiſh Faith, Hope and Love; yet when he ſpeaketh of Faith as ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying, and as the form of a Chriſtian, he comprehendeth Love to Chriſt as Saviour in it, and a confidence in him, ſuch as in common Language we call Hope. As Love ſignifieth the Paſſion of the ſoul, it may be a conſequent; but as it is but the <hi>velle Chriſtum, &amp; beneficia oblata,</hi> ſo it is faith it ſelf, as <hi>Maccovius</hi> and <hi>Chamier</hi> have truly told the Papiſts.

                  <p>Prop. 3. <hi>It is not not only God the Father, nor only Chriſt the Redeemer, nor only the Promiſe, nor only pardon, or Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or Heaven, that is the object of that faith which</hi> Paul <hi>oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to works in Juſification.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argument</hi> 1. If many or all theſe art ſo linked together, that to believe one of them as revealed in Scripture, is to believe more or all, then it is not any one of them alone that is the object of that Faith which <hi>Paul</hi> oppoſeth to works. But the <hi>Antecedent</hi> is true, as is evident, e. g. <hi>To believe in Chriſt,</hi> is to <hi>believe the promiſe of the Goſpel concerning Chriſt.</hi> For there is no <hi>Belief</hi> without a <hi>word of revelation</hi> to believe. So that here <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Promiſe</hi> are neceſſarily conjunct, and Chriſt and the Goſpel Hiſtory. And to <hi>believe the Gospel</hi> with a Divine Faith, is to <hi>Believe Gods veracity,</hi> and to believe the Goſpel <hi>becauſe</hi> of Gods Veracity: For this is the <hi>Objectum formale</hi> without which there is no faith. So that <hi>Believing in God</hi> is
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:60968:218"/>
eſſential to all Divine faith. Alſo <hi>materially</hi>; to <hi>Believe in Chriſt,</hi> is to <hi>Believe in him as our Saviour, to ſave us from the Guilt of ſin,</hi> even as <hi>to believe in a Phyſitian</hi> is to Truſt on him to cure us of our Diſeaſes. So <hi>forgiveneſs of ſin,</hi> being an end eſſential to Chriſts Office, it is eſſential to our Faith in Chriſt. So alſo to believe in Chriſt as a Saviour, is to believe in him <hi>as one that is able and willing to reconcile us,</hi> and bring us to the <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi> of God: And ſo <hi>God and his favour and Reconciliation</hi> with him are ends eſſential to the office of a Saviour (as health is to the Phyſitians) and therefore they are eſſential to our <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in a Saviour.</hi> The ſame may be ſaid of eternal Life: ſo that you may ſee that theſe have eſſential reſpects to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Chriſt cannot be believed in alone without the reſt as co-eſſentials reſpectively in the object of our faith. Nor can the Promiſe be believed without believing in the Promiſer and Promiſed.</p>
                  <p>Argument 2. <hi>The Scripture moſt expreſly maketh many ſuch Objects of that faith which</hi> Paul <hi>oppoſeth to works in Juſtification; therefore ſo muſt we.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Rom. 3.22, 24, 25, 26. There are expreſly mentioned all theſe Objects of juſtifying faith. 1. <hi>The Righteouſneſs of God.</hi> 2, <hi>The Perſon of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 3. <hi>Redemption by Chriſt, and his propitiatory blood.</hi> 4. <hi>Remiſſion of ſins paſt.</hi> 5. <hi>God as a Juſtifier of Believers</hi>; ſee the Text.</p>

                     <hi>E. g.</hi> 1. An Aſſent to the truth of the Goſpel in general as the Word of God. 2. A belief on Gods Veracity in this expreſt. 3. An Aſſent to the Truth of the Word that telleth us that Chriſt is God. 4. An Aſſent to the truth of the Article of Chriſts Manhood. 5. An Aſſent to the Truth of the Article of his conception by the Holy Ghoſt, and being born of a Virgin, 6. And to the Article of his being born without original ſin in himſelf. 7. And to the Article of his ſinleſs holy life. 8. And to the Article of his actual death. 9. And that this death was for our ſins. 10. And that God hath accepted it as a ſufficient Ranſom, ſacrifice or Attonement. 11. And that he actually roſe again from the dead, and overcame death. 12. And that he is the Lord and King of the Church. 13. And that he is the Prophet and Teacher of the Church. 14. And that he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended into Heaven and Glorified, God and man. 15. And that he is now our Interceſſor &amp; Mediator with the Father. 16. And that he hath purchaſed by his Ranſom and given or offered in the Goſpel, the free pardon of ſin. 17. And that he hath alſo purchaſed &amp; offered us eternal life in Glory with God. 18. And that its the members of Chriſt, and of the Holy Catholick Church, that ſhall partake of pardon and life by Chriſt. 19. And that he will give us the Reſurrection of life at laſt. 20. And that he will judge the world. I have omitted our ſpecial Belief in God the Father as Creator, and in the Holy Ghoſt, and have given you in theſe twenty Acts, no more then what is contained in this one word, <hi>[I believe in Chriſt as Chriſt]</hi> I think there is if any, but few that are not eſſential to Faith in Jeſus Chriſt as the Saviour. And all theſe acts of aſſent are parts of the faith that is the means of our Juſtification; and none of them part of the excluded works. And beſides all theſe there are as many acts of the Will as of the Intellect concurring in or to this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:60968:219"/>
aſſent, ſo that there's twenty more. For its plain, that ſeeing the objects of all theſe are Good as well as True, they being all Truths concerning our benefit and Salvation, the Will it ſelf in the Intellects aſſenting, doth command it to aſſent, and alſo doth place a certain Affiance in the Revealer, which we call in Engliſh <hi>crediting</hi> or <hi>Giving credit to one,</hi> we <hi>reſt</hi> our ſelves upon his Truth. As I ſaid before, <hi>Veracity</hi> is Gods <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> and Veracity is the formal Object in every one of the other Acts about the material Object; and therefore the Will muſt act upon <hi>Veracity,</hi> and ſo have a part in aſſent it ſelf: not <hi>as aſſent,</hi> but as a <hi>Voluntary aſſent,</hi> and as an <hi>aſſent</hi> to <hi>Promiſes</hi> or <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi> of <hi>good to us.</hi> There is goodneſs in the word of Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſubordinate, or in order to the good Revealed. And ſo there is an act of the <hi>Will</hi> upon the good in the Word, compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated with the Intellects Aſſent, beſides the following fuller act of the Will, upon Chriſt and the benefits themſelves. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is a twofold Affiance. 1. An Affiance in <hi>Gods Vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city as the Revealer.</hi> 2. An Affiance in <hi>Chriſt the Mediator, as the beſtower, accompliſher and actual Saviour or Deliverer</hi> according to his Office and Covenant. The firſt is an act of the Will concurring with Aſſent. And of this <hi>Pembles</hi> opinion is neer Truth, though not fully it. For here Affiance is as cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly joyned with Aſſent as Heat in the Sun with Light, though they are not the ſame, But then the ſecond ſort of Affiance followeth Aſſent, and hath another act of the Will interce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, which is Conſent or acceptance of the Benefit offered; which alſo is cloſely conjunct with the firſt act of the Will. And then followeth laſt of all affiance in Chriſt for the performance of the undertaken acts. And theſe latter are alſo many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Phyſical acts, as the objects <hi>in ſpecie ſpecialiſſima</hi> are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. And yet all theſe make but one object in a moral ſenſe, and ſo but one act, and are done in a few moments of time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of which after. Would it not be too tedious, I ſhould ſtay to cite ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Texts, to prove that never a one of all theſe acts is exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as works by <hi>Paul.</hi> But of divers of them its before proved from <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. and 4. and of more in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. and in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21, 22. There are at leaſt theſe Objects of Juſtifying faith expreſſed. 1. <hi>Chriſts Perſon,</hi> 2. that
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:60968:220"/>
                     <hi>he was ſeed promiſed.</hi> 3. That he <hi>was crucified.</hi> 4. That this was <hi>for our ſins.</hi> 5. That <hi>he was made a curſe for us in this his death.</hi> 6. That <hi>hereby he Redeemed us from the curſe.</hi> 7. That <hi>he is the Mediator.</hi> 8. <hi>God as the Party with whom he is Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</hi> 9. <hi>God as Believed in his Promiſe.</hi> 10. <hi>God as Juſtifier.</hi> 11. <hi>The Goſpel preached, and he Promiſe made.</hi> 12. <hi>Bleſſedneſs by Chriſt.</hi> 13. <hi>The confirmed Covenant.</hi> 14. <hi>The Inheritance.</hi> 15. <hi>Righteouſneſs.</hi> 16. <hi>Adoption.</hi> 17. <hi>That Belief</hi> is the means, and <hi>believers</hi> the ſubjects of theſe benefits. All theſe objects of Faith you will find in the Text.</p>
                  <p>Argument 2. <hi>Ex natura rei.</hi> If other acts of faith in Chriſt <hi>are</hi> no more works then that one (whatſoever it be) which you will ſay <hi>Paul</hi> oppoſeth to works, then <hi>Paul</hi> doth not <hi>call</hi> them works<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or number them with works. But the <hi>Antecedent</hi> is true, therefore ſo is the <hi>Conſequent.</hi> Doubtleſs the Scripture calls them as they are: and therefore if they are not works, it calls them not works. And for the <hi>Antecedent,</hi> 1. If by <hi>works</hi> you mean the Keeping of the firſt Covenant by ſinleſs obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſo neither the one or the other are works. 2. If you mean the keeping of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law; ſo neither of them are <hi>works.</hi> 3. If you mean the performance of an act of obedience to any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of God, ſo the ſeveral acts are <hi>works,</hi> but juſtifie not as acts of obedience to the command (thats but their matter) but as the condition of the Promiſe. 4. If you mean that they are <hi>Acts</hi> of the ſoul of man, ſo every act of Faith is a work, though it juſtifie not as ſuch, ſo that here is no difference to be found. <hi>E. g.</hi> If you make the Believing in Chriſt as Dying, (though you take in both aſſent and affiance) to be the only Juſtifying act; what reaſon can you give why our Believing in Chriſt incarnate, in Chriſt obeying the Law, in Chriſt riſing again, and Glorified and Interceding, in Chriſt actually now giving out the pardon of ſin and Adoption, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhould be called <hi>works</hi> any more then our Believing in Chriſt as crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? No reaſon at all, nor any Scripture can be brought for it. Yea what reaſon have you that our Believing in Chriſt as the Phyſitian of our ſouls, to cure us of our ſins, and cleanſe our hearts, and ſanctifie our Natures, and in Chriſt as the Teacher and Guide of our ſouls to life eternal, ſhould be called works
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:60968:220"/>
any more then the other? Or that believing in Chriſts blood for everlaſting Life and happineſs, ſhould be any more called works then believing in his blood for Juſtification? Yea that Believing in him as the King, and Head, and Captain of his Church to ſubdue their enemies, and by his Government con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct them to perſeverance and to Glory, ſhould any more be called <hi>works</hi> then believing on him as crucified in order to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argument</hi> 3. All acts Eſſential to faith in Chriſt as Chriſt, are oppoſed to works by <hi>Paul</hi> in the point of Juſtification, and are not the works oppoſed to Faith. But many acts are eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to faith in Chriſt as Chriſt; therefore they are many acts that are oppoſed to works; and no one of thoſe acts is the works excluded.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is proved thus: If faith in Chriſt as ſuch, be it that <hi>Paul</hi> oppoſeth to works, then every eſſential part of it is by <hi>Paul</hi> oppoſed to works (for it is not faith in Chriſt if it want any eſſential part) But the <hi>Antecedent</hi> is true. <hi>Ergo.</hi> — The <hi>Minor</hi> I have proved in the firſt Diſputation: Though ſometime it is ſaid to be <hi>[by faith in his blood]</hi> that we have remiſſion of ſin; and ſometime that we are juſtified <hi>if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him that raiſed Chriſt from the dead,</hi> &amp;c. Yet moſt frequently it is ſaid to be <hi>by faith in Chriſt; by believing in the Lord Jeſus, receiving Chriſt Jeſus the Lord</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Belive in the Lord Jeſus, and thou ſhalt be ſaved,</hi> was the Goſpel preached to the Jaylor, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. But this is ſufficiently proved already. That many acts are eſſential to faith in Chriſt as ſuch, is alſo proved: and particularly, that believing in him as our Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, Lord, and as Riſing, Interceding, and Juſtifying by ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and Gift, as well as believing in him as dying for our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification. As Chriſt is not Chriſt (as to his Office and work) without theſe Eſſentials, ſo faith is not the Chriſtian faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out theſe acts.</p>
                  <p>But here obſerve that though I ſay theſe acts of faith are not the works which <hi>Paul</hi> excludeth, I ſpeak of them as they <hi>are,</hi> and not as they are <hi>miſunderſtood:</hi> For if any man ſhould imagine that Believing in Chriſt is a Legal Meritorious work, and <hi>that</hi> can juſtifie him of or for it ſelf; I will not deny but
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:60968:221"/>
he may ſo make <hi>another thing</hi> of faith, and ſo bring it among excluded works (if it be poſſible for him to believe contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories:) But then, this is as true of one act of Faith as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: If a man imagine that its thus Meritorious to Believe in Chriſt as purchaſing him Juſtification, it is as much the exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed works, as to think it Meritorious to Believe in him as our Teacher, or King and Judge, that will lead us to final Abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and actually juſtifie us by his Sentence at that Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argument</hi> 4. Thoſe acts of Faith that are neceſſary to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, are none of the works that <hi>Paul</hi> excludeth from Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification (unleſs changed by miſunderſtanding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as aforeſaid.) But other acts of faith as well as one are neceſſary to Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: <hi>Ergo.</hi>—</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> (which only is worthy the labour of a proof) 1. is proved before, and in the firſt Diſputation. 2. And it is confeſſed by my Opponents, that ſay [<hi>Faith in Chriſt as Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, King, &amp;c. is the</hi> fides quae Juſtificat, <hi>and the condition of Juſtification, as Repentance alſo is, though it be not the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental cauſe, as they think ſome other Act is. Paul</hi> doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that which he makes neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argument</hi> 5. That which makes not the Reward to be of Debt and not of Grace, is none of the works that <hi>Paul</hi> ſets faith againſt. But other acts of faith in Chriſt do not make the reward to be of Debt and not of Grace any more then the <hi>one</hi> act which you will chooſe (<hi>E. g.</hi> Believing in Chriſt as King and Teacher, any more then believing in him as a Ranſom:) therefore they are not the works that <hi>Pauls</hi> ſets faith againſt. The <hi>Major</hi> is proved from the Deſcription of the excluded works, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.4. The <hi>Minor</hi> is evident.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argument</hi> 6. All acts of Faith in Chriſt <hi>as our Juſtifier,</hi> are ſuch as are oppoſed to works by <hi>Paul,</hi> and are none of the works which faith is oppoſed to. But they are more then one or two that are Acts of faith in Chriſt as Juſtifier: <hi>Ergo.</hi>—</p>
                  <p>The Major I think will be granted; the Minor is plain: For
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:60968:221"/>
1. Chriſt juſtifieth us meritoriouſly as a Sacrifice. 2. And as O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying and fulfilling the Law. 3. As the complement of his ſatisfaction, and the entrance upon his following execution, his Reſurrection juſtifieth us. 4. As the Heavenly Prieſt at Gods right hand, he juſtifieth us by his Interceſſion. 5 As King and Head, he juſtifieth us by his Covenant or Law of Grace. 6. As King and Judge he juſtifieth us by ſentence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 7. As Prophet he teacheth us the Doctrine of Juſtification, and how to attain to Juſtification by ſentence. So that at leaſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> none of theſe are the excluded works.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 7. If the whole Eſſence of Chriſtian faith be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to works, and ſo be none of the oppoſed works in the matter of Salvation, then its ſo alſo in the matter of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But the Antecedent is true; therefore ſo is the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent.</p>
                  <p>The Minor is confeſſed by my Opponents. The conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the Major I prove. 1. Becauſe Salvation is as free as Juſtification, and no more of works which <hi>Paul</hi> exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. 2. Salvation comprehendeth Juſtification: and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification hath the ſame conditions as final Juſtification at Judgement, it being part of Juſtification to adjudge that Glory. 3. The expreſs Scripture excludes works as much from Salvation as from Juſtification: Eph. 2.8, 9. <hi>For by Grace ye are ſaved through faith; and that not of your ſelves, it is the gift of God: not of works, leſt any man ſhould boaſt.</hi> Tit. 3.5, 6, 7. <hi>[Not by works of Righteouſneſs which we have done, but according to his Mercy he ſaved us, by the waſhing of, Regeneration, and the renewing of the Holy Ghoſt, which he ſhed on us abundantly, through Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour, that being juſtified by his Grace, we ſhould be made Heirs according to the hope of eternal Life.]</hi> Many ſuch places are obvious to any diligent Reader. For the Minor alſo read 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 8. If no man can <hi>name any one</hi> Act of faith that is oppoſed to all <hi>the reſt</hi> as <hi>works,</hi> or oppoſed to works when
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:60968:222"/>
the reſt are not, then no ſuch thing it to be aſſerted. But no man can name the Act that is thus oppoſed alone to works. 1. It is not yet done that I know of. We cannot get them to tell us what Act it is. 2. And if they do, others will make as good a claim to the Prerogative.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 9. They that oppoſe us, and affirm the Queſtion, do feign God to have a ſtrange partiality to one Act of faith above all the reſt, without any reaſon or aptitude in that act to be ſo exalted. But this is not to be feigned (and proved it cannot be,) that God ſhould annex our Juſtification to the Belief in Chriſt as a ſacrifice only; and to oppoſe this to belief in him as Riſing, Interceding, Teaching, Promiſing or Judging, is a fiction contrary to Scripture. Examine any Text you pleaſe, and ſee whether it will run well with ſuch an Expoſition, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.4, 5. [<hi>Now to him that worketh, i. e. Believeth in Chriſt as Teacher, Judge, Interceſſor,</hi> &amp; <hi>is the reward not reckoned of Grace but of Debt. But to him that worketh not, that is, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not on Chriſt as King and Teacher,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but Believeth on him that juſtifieth the ungodly</hi> (an act of his Kingly office) <hi>&amp;c.</hi> —Doth this run well? I will not trouble you with ſo unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury a Paraphraſe upon the like Scriptures: you may try at pleaſure on <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. &amp; 4. and <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. or any ſuch Text.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argument</hi> 10. If the Doctrine of the Opponents (holding the Affirmative) were true, then no man can tell whether he be a condemned Legaliſt, or not: yea more, if it be not faith in Chriſt as ſuch (containing the whole Eſſence) by which we are juſtified, as oppoſed to works, or which is none of the exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded works; then no man can tell but he is a condemned Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galiſt. But the <hi>Conſequent is</hi> falſe; therefore ſo is the <hi>Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Reaſon of the Conſequence is, becauſe no man is able to tell you which is the ſole juſtifying Act, or which are the only acts, if it be not faith Eſſentially that is it; for among all the acts before mentioned, if a man miſtake and think one
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:60968:222"/>
other (<hi>E. g.</hi> faith in Chriſts Reſurrection, in Chriſt as King, Judge, Teacher, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) is it by which he muſt be juſtified, then he falls upon Juſtification by Works, and ſo falls ſhort of Grace: for if it be of Works, then it is no more of Grace: elſe Works were no Works. And ſo no man can tell but he deſtroyeth Grace, and expecteth Juſtification by works: much leſs can weak Chriſtians tell. I never yet ſaw or heard from any Divine a juſt Nomination (with proof) of the one Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying act, or a juſt Enumeration of the many acts, if all muſt not be taken in that are Eſſential. Some ſay Affiance is the only act: but as thats confuted by the moſt that take in Aſſent alſo, ſo there are many and many acts of Affiance in Chriſt that are neceſſary: and they ſhould tell us which of theſe it is.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>And do you think that we can any better tell when we have all that are Eſſential? Or doth every weak Chriſtian be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all the twenty Articles that you mentioned at firſt?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. We can better know what is Revealed then whats unrevealed. The Scripture tells us what faith in Chriſt is; but not what one or two acts do Juſtifie, excluding all other as Works. Divines have often defined Faith; but I know not that any hath defined any ſuch one act, as thus exalted above the reſt of the Eſſence of Faith. If we covld not tell what is eſſential to Faith, we could not tell what faith is. 2. The twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Objects of Aſſent before mentioned are not all Articles or material Objects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ſecond is the formal Object. And of the reſt, unleſs the Fifth <hi>[Believing that Chriſt was concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Holy Ghoſt, and born of a Virgin]</hi> may be excepted (which I dare not affirm) I know not of one thats not eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to Chriſtianity. And I think if we had Hereticks among us that denyed Chriſt to be conceived by the Holy Ghoſt, we ſhould ſcarce take them for Chriſtians. But that man that ſhall deny or not believe that Chriſt is God, that he is Man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he was no ſinner, that he dyed, and that for our ſins, and that he was a Sacrifice or Ranſom for us, and that he Roſe
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:60968:223"/>
again, is Glorified, and will judge us: that he hath offered us a pardon of ſin; that there will be a Reſurrection of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and life Everlaſting by this our Redeemer, I cannot ſee how he can be a Chriſtian. And for the number of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> left out much of the ancient Creed it ſelf, (the Belief in God the Father, Creator, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the Holy Ghoſt: the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the Catholick Church, the Communion of Saints, of Chriſts burial, Deſcent into Hell, and more.) And yet do you think this too big to be eſſential to Chriſtian Faith? If ſo, tell not any Heretick that denyeth any one of theſe, that he denyeth an Eſſential Article of our faith.</p>
                  <p>But for the ignorant weak Chriſtian, I ſay, 1. He know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all theſe Articles that I have named; but 2. perhaps not with ſo ripe a manner of apprehenſion as is formed into men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal words, or which he can expreſs in words to others: I find my ſelf in my ſtudies, that I have ſomtimes an apprehenſion of a Truth before I have ripened that conception for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. 3. And perhaps they are not Methodical and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct in their conceptions, and cannot ſay that there are juſt ſo many Articles. Every ſick man can underſtand what it is to deſire and accept of ſuch a man to be his Phyſitian; and herein he firſt verily deſireth health, and ſecondly, deſireth Phyſick as a means to Health, and thirdly, deſireth the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian in order to the uſe of that means, and fourthly, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in doth take him to be a Phyſitian, and fifthly, to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent skill, and ſixthly, to be in ſome meaſure faithful, to be truſted, and ſeventhly, doth place ſome confidence in him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all this and more is truly in his mind; and yet perhaps they are not ripened and meaſured into ſuch diſtinct conceptions, as that he can diſtinctly tell you all this in tolerable Language, or doth obſerve then as diſtinct Conceptions in himſelf (and whether <hi>uno intuitu</hi> the eye and the Intellect may not ſee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Objects, though <hi>ab objectis,</hi> the acts muſt be called ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and divers, is a Controverſie among Philoſophers; and as I remember <hi>Pet. Hurtad. de Mendoza</hi> affirmeth it.) But if you your ſelves will form all theſe into diſtinct concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ask your Catechiſt his judgement of them, its like
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:60968:223"/>
he can mak you perceive at leaſt by a <hi>Yea</hi> or <hi>Nay,</hi> that he underſtands them all. The new formed body of the Infant in the Womb hath all the Integral parts of a man; and yet ſo ſmall that you cannot ſo eaſily diſcern them as you may do the ſame parts when he is grown up to manhood. So the knowledge of every particular Eſſential Article of faith is truly in the weakeſt Chriſtian in the very moment of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion; but perhaps it may be but by a more crude imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Conception, that obſerveth not every Article diſtinctly, nor any of them very clearly, but his knowledge is both too dim and too confuſed. And yet I muſt ſay that it is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch as ſome Papiſts call a Virtual or Implicite Faith or knowledge, As to believe only the General Revelation and the formal Object; as that the Scripture is Gods Word, and God is true: or that whatever the Church propounds as an Article of faith is true; while they know not what the Church or Scripture doth propound: for this is not actual Chriſtian faith, but ſuch a part as a man may have that is no Chriſtian. And yet ſome Papiſts would perſwade us that where this much is, there is ſaving faith, though the perſon believe not (yea, or deny by the probable Doctrine of ſeducing Doctors) ſome of the foreſaid Eſſential Articles.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 11. If the terms [<hi>Faith in Chriſt, receiving Chriſt, Reſting on Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c.] are to be underſtood as <hi>Civil, Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical and Ethical terms</hi> in a moral ſenſe, then muſt we ſuppoſe that they ſignifie many Phyſical acts, and not any one only. But theſe terms are to be thus morally underſtood. <hi>Ergo.</hi>— The Antecedent is proved thus. Terms are to be underſtood according to the nature of the Subject and Doctrine: But the Subject and Doctrine of the Goſpel which uſeth theſe terms, is Moral Political: therefore the terms are agreeably to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted. The ſame term in Phyſick, Law, Mathematicks, Soldiery, Navigation, Husbandry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> hath various ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: but ſtill it muſt be interpreted according to the nature and uſe of the doctrine, Art or Science that maketh uſe of it. The conſequence of the Major is proved, becauſe it is the uſe of Ethicks and Politicks thus to interpret ſuch phraſes, as
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:60968:224"/>
containing divers Phyſical Acts. Marriage is one Civil act; but it is many Phyſical Acts: it containeth divers acts of the underſtanding concerning the Eſſentials of the Relation: and divers acts of the Will in conſenting thereunto; and the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward words or ſigns of Conſent, for making the Contract. So taking a man to be my King my General, my Tutor, Teacher, Paſtor, Phyſician, Maſter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all ſignifie the acts of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, Will and expreſſing Powers, which the ſeveral parts of the Objects do require.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argument</hi> 12. If there be many Acts <hi>beſides Faith in Chriſt, attendant</hi> on it, and <hi>ſubſervient</hi> to it, which are none of the works which <hi>Paul</hi> excludeth, and oppoſeth faith to; then the Eſſential Acts of faith it ſelf are none of thoſe works. But the Antecedent is true, as I prove in ſome inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:</p>
                  <p>For a man to repent of ſin, to confeſs it, to believe and confeſs that we are unworthy of any Mercy, and unable to juſtifie our ſelves, or make ſatisfaction for our ſias, and that we are in abſolute neceſſity of Chriſt, having no Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, Sanctification or Sufficiency of our own, to take God for our Father reconciled in Chriſt, and to Love him accordingly: to forgive our Brethren from the ſenſe of Chriſts forgiving us: to ſhew our Faith by fruitfull works and words. When <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.4, 5. <hi>[To him that worketh the Reward is not of Grace]</hi> the meaning is not <hi>[To him that repenteth to him that denieth himſelf and his own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs to his Juſtification, to him that confeſſeth his ſin, that loveth God as a reconciled Father in Chriſt, &amp;c,]</hi> and when he ſaith, <hi>[To him that worketh not, but believeth]</hi> the meaning is not [<hi>to him that loveth not God, to him that repenteth not, that forgiveth not others,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but believeth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>But yet it may be [to him that thinketh not to be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by or for theſe, but by Faith.]</hi> Anſwer 1. Concomitants and Subordinates may not be ſet in oppoſition; faith ſuppoſeth the Concomitancy and Subſerviency of theſe in and to Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:60968:224"/>
2. Believing in Chriſts Ranſom, may as well be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded too, if men think to be juſtified for ſo doing meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly. 3. He that thinketh to be Juſtified by any work in that way which is oppoſed to Juſtification by Grace and Faith, muſt think to be juſtified by the Merit of them, or without a Saviour, which all theſe Graces forementioned con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict. 4. God ſaith expreſly, that we muſt [<hi>Repent and be converted, that our ſins may be blotted out: and repent that we may be forgiven: and if we confeſs our ſins, he is faithfull and juſt to forgive us our ſins: and if we forgive, we ſhall be forgiven; and that by works we are juſtified and not by faith only: and that by our words we ſhall be juſtified:</hi> So that <hi>Pauls</hi> works which he oppoſeth faith to, are neither <hi>Jame</hi>'s <hi>works,</hi> nor any of theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars mentioned: for theſe are made neceſſary conditions or means of pardon, and of ſome ſort of Juſtification, ſuch as <hi>Pauls</hi> works could not contribute to, which were falſly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined by the doers to make the Reward to be not of Grace but Debt.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>There is but one faith, Eph.</hi> 4.3. Anſwer. But that <hi>One</hi> faith hath many Phyſical Acts or Articles. There is but one true Religion, but it hath many parts. There is but one Goſpel, but that one contanieth many particular Truths.</p>
                  <div type="part">

                        <pb n="422" facs="tcp:60968:225"/>COnſect. 1. To be <hi>juſtified by Faith,</hi> is to be juſtified by <hi>Faith in Chriſt as Chriſt,</hi> and not by any one part of that Faith, excluding any of its Eſſential parts.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To be juſtified by Faith in Chriſt as <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſo as Riſing, Teaching, Pardoning, Ruling, Judging, as well as ſatisfying, <hi>i.e.</hi> as the Saviour that hath undertaken all this, is not in <hi>Pauls</hi> ſenſe to be juſtified by works: therefore it is the true Juſtification by Faith.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is therefore unſound to make any one Act or part of Faith the <hi>fides qua Juſtificans,</hi> and the other Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial parts to be the <hi>fides qua juſtificat,</hi> when no more can be ſaid of any but that it is <hi>fides ex qua juſtificamur,</hi> and that may be ſaid of all.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Though Faith be an Acceptance of Chriſt and Life as offered in the Goſpel, ſo that its very Nature or Eſſence is morally Receptive, which may tolerab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be called its Metaphorical Paſſive Inſtrumentality; yet are we not juſtified by it <hi>qua talis,</hi> that is, <hi>qua fides,</hi> and ſo not <hi>quatenus Inſtrumentum tale Metaphoricum, vel Acceptatio, vel Receptio moralis,</hi> but <hi>qua conditio Teſtamenti vel faederis praſtita.</hi>

Therefore it is not only the Acceptance of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs by which we are juſtified, much leſs the Affiance in Chriſt as dying only; but the Belief in Chriſt as the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer of Salvation, and as the Sanctifier, Guide and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of our ſouls in order thereunto, hath as true an Intereſt in our Juſtification as the believing in him for Pardon. And ſo far as any other holy act doth modifie and ſubſerve faith, and is part of the Condition of Juſtification with it, ſo far by it alſo we are juſtified.</p>
