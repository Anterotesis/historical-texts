            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

requite and repay you with miſchiefe, for a ſmall iniurie or treſpaſſe, vnwillingly or not wittingly, committed by you againſt them. <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi> ſayth the ſame. <hi>Plato</hi> ſayth, All humane things grow old, and come to the end of their time, except <hi>Ingratitude;</hi> for the greater the encreaſe of mortall man is, the more doth <hi>Ingratitude</hi> augment.

               <p>If I could leaue any<note place="margin">The Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals Legacy.</note> thing (poore Earth) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind me, it ſhould be my prayers, that the ſimple honeſt-minded man may quickly leaue thee: Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is no Tenant for thee, ſhee ſhall bee ſhut ſoone out of doores, hauing no other Trade then hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie.</p>
               <p>If I ſhould giue thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, it ſhould be that which thou needeſt, leſſe vanitie, more ſtayedneſſe, leſſe hypocriſie, and more ſincereneſſe.</p>
               <p>If I ſhould begge any thing of thee, it ſhould neyther bee fame, nor

popular praiſe, for I am mortified, and doe not loue it: it ſhould be, that thou wouldeſt rumour my vices, that others hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them may be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
               <p>If thou wouldſt haue me doe aught for thee, I will doe it willingly, ſo it be not to ſtay with thee.

                  <hi>ſpe, nec metu;</hi> will I tarry with thee. As I did once loue thee, ſo am I willing

to leaue thee; for I haue obſerued ſuch as loued thee, die in their beds vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietly. As I made thee once my palace, bee now my graue: I loue thee not ſo ill, but I will leaue ſomething with thee: my body thou ſhalt haue, for thou foſteredſt it, but my ſoule ſhall fly to him that made it.</p>
               <p>This is all the legacie I will make to earth: it now reſts that I make my vowes to heauen, this little which I gaue to the firſt, is too much; this all which I giue to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, is too little: yet will my vowes be acceptable to heauen, proceeding

from him that willingly for heauen forſakes earth.</p>
               <p>I haue ſoiourned long enough vpon earth, now am I for my war-fare to heauen; hauing charity for my ſcrip, confidence for my ſtaffe, and deſire for my guide: charity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards my brother, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in God, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire towards heauen: in my abode heere I haue patience to indure, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence to retire, reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to conquer. Patience to indure afflictions, prouidence retiring to Chriſts compaſſion, and reſolution to conquer all incurſions. I will neuer
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:14828:141"/>
ſo preſume on Gods mercy, as to forget he is a Iudge, or deſpaire on Gods mercy, to forget he is a Father. I will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the ſeruants of God ſuffer afflictions, though with bitterneſſe, then enioy pleaſures of ſinne for a ſeaſon, and looſe my inheritance. My beſt Arithmeticke, ſhall be numbring of my dayes, that when my dayes bee ſummed vp, I may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue for them length of dayes.</p>
               <p>I am ſorry I haue reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued but my Winter for Chriſt, hauing ſpent my Spring in the ſeruice of Antichriſt.</p>

                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:14828:141"/>Yet ſo much ſhall my feruencie appeare now at my returne, as it may counterpoize my ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, before my returne. As I was clothed before with the garment of vanitie, I will put on me the ſimple robe of Chriſts humilitie. I will not waſh my ſelfe in Syloe, nor in Iordan, but in the poole Betheſda of Spirituall Syon. Thus am I to my Chriſt eſpouſed, for my troth is plighted: I will ſay therefore with the Spouſe: I haue waſhed my feete, how ſhould I defile them againe? Now let the Prodigals teares end with the Pilgrimes wiſh. I deſire to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued:
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:14828:142"/>
not as one wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſuffer afflictions, for his <hi>SAVIOVR,</hi> but as one willing to leaue the Earth, that hee may liue euer, in the armes of his <hi>REDEEMER.</hi>
