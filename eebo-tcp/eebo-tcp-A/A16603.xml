            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

true hearted Christians to a holy and reuerend regard, and due vse of them, whensoeuer they be called thereunto.</p>
                  <p>In this order and course which the Apostle heere ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth, we may learne by the way these short instructions:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the ignorance or want of due consideration of the doctrine concerning this Sacrament is one maine and principall cause, that so many doe contemne and prophane the same.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That there is no hope or possibilitie, that grosse igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant persons, who know not the doctrine of this Sacrament, (so long as they continue igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant thereof) should euer with due reuerence receiue the same. And therefore so oft as in their ignorance they goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:19920:9"/>
to bee made partaker thereof, they runne themselues and their soules vpon a most dangerous rocke: So that the first meanes for a Christian to become a worthy and reuerend partaker of this Sacrament, is to bee grounded in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and knowledge thereof. Ignorance indeed well may be the mother of Popish deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but it is the very stepdame of all true Christian pietie, and (as it appeares by the Apostles proceedings in this present matter) the very mother of all prophanenesse, and irreligious impieties in the Church of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The first point of doctrine concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>The first point of doctrine is concerning the authority and commission by which <hi>Paul</hi> brought this Sacrament into the Church: the summe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:19920:9"/>
and effect wherof is this: <hi>That this Sacrament is no humane Tradition, brought into the Church vpon his owne head, and by his owne meere will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, but an ordinance of Christ, receiued by Tradition from him.</hi> For so hee saith: <hi>I haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of the Lord that which I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so haue deliuered vnto you.</hi> As though hee should more fully and plainly haue said, If this Sacrament had beene a deuise of mine owne braine, or a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition hauing no other ground than mine owne will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, then might you haue had some colorable excuse for your light account and profanation of it: but I deliuering this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance vnto you by expresse warrant and commission from Christ Iesus himselfe, the sole soueraign head of the Church,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:19920:10"/>
you ought with more reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and regard to haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the same, than lately you haue done.</p>
                  <p>The lessons from hence to further our preparation to the due receiuing of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are these:</p>
                  <p n="1">1 That it is no small sinne to vse any ordinance of Jesus Christ, whatsoeuer, prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or irreuerently: such cannot bee freed from sinne, as shall shew contempt but vnto the ordinances of men, though they require but <hi>things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent:</hi> much lesse can they which shall shew contempt to the ordinances of Christ Iesus himselfe, who neuer instituted any thing which is not excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding good, and necessary to to be done; yea, whose very ordaining of a thing makes it
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:19920:10"/>
good, necessary, and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, though before it was indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, and vnprofitable, yea euill and hurtfull. For this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but argue a wonderfull base and light estimation of Christ, and of his wisdome, to debase, by rude and vnreue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent behauiour, any order or constitution of his: And yet how ordinary a thing is it for most men that are professed Christians, to make most base and vile account, euen no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than a may-game, of the main and principall ordinance of Christ? What palpable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the word read and preached, of praier, of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, of the Sabboth, &amp;c. doe most men shew? How rudely, carelesly, and vnreue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, doe they vse to behaue themselues, euen in the solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:19920:11"/>
and most publike worship and seruice of God; yea often times not without apparent scorne &amp; disdaine of the same? What should we iudge of this? but that such either think that Christ himselfe is a mockerie, or at the least, that hee hath shewed great want of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, in requiring so base and contemptible a seruice, such as is not fit for wise men to performe, but in iest or scorne, or (at the best) but as if they were playing some counterfet part vpon a stage.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 A speciall meanes to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent this sinne, in the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of this Sacrament, is to learne and to beleeue, that in receiuing the same, we do not conforme to the priuate hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, conceits, and pleasures of men, no not of <hi>Peter</hi> or
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:19920:11"/>
                     <hi>Paul,</hi> of Magistrates or Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, of Churches or Fathers; but to the expresse Will and Commandement of our Lord and Sauiour Jesus Christ. This is in the nature of man, that if hee bee imperiously comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded any thing by an inferiour and one that hath no authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to command, though the thing commanded bee in it selfe commodious, praise wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, or honourable, yet he ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will refuse to doe it, or if he doe it, it shall be not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some scorn and contempt, and in a kinde of mockerie: But if one in authoritie, whom he reuerenceth and honoureth, and whom hee knoweth hath power to command, doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire any thing, he will be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy (except hee bee very leaud and impious) to yeeld obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:19920:12"/>
in feare and reuerence, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the action in it selfe bee light and vnprofitable, yea base and seruile, yea trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some and hurtfull vnto him. Except therefore wee should be so impious, as to hold, that Christ Jesus hath either no power to require this dutie at our hand, or so impudent, as to defend, that he doth nowhere require it of vs, or so blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, as to say he wanted wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in requiring it of vs, it must needs bee yeelded vnto, that this sacrament ought with all due reuerence to bee recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, which is inioined by so awfull and soueraigne a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, bee the action it selfe in it selfe neuer so meane. When therefore men come so rudely and vnreuerently to these ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Rites, it is a signe, that they
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:19920:12"/>
neuer thinke of that high and sacred authority that hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained them. This then is and ought to be the maine founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all true reuerence, not only toward this, but al other parts of Gods worship and seruice, <hi>That Christ Iesus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth this Seruice at our hands.</hi> Would then the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and seruaunts of Iesus Christ, that are by their speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all office to dispense the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Christ, haue their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery truly reuerenced of the saints and people of God, and not contemned and despised? Let them make it appeare, as <hi>Paul</hi> doth heere, that they mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister no other word or Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, prescribe no other wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, preach no other Gospell, binde mens consciences with no other lawes, allure them
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:19920:13"/>
with no other promises, feare them with no other threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, than such as they haue receiued from Christ himselfe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond point of doctrine concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>The second point of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine propounded by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, is concerning the first Institutor and Administer of this Sacrament. The effect whereof is this; <hi>That Christ Iesus in his owne person did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute, yea and first of all with his owne hand administer this Sacrament.</hi> For it followeth in these words, <hi>That the Lord Iesus, the night that he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traied, tooke bread,</hi> &amp;c. As though hee should say, If but my selfe, or any other Apostle, or any person inferiour to an Apostle, had instituted this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, by warrant and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission from Christ, there had beene therein cause enough to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:19920:13"/>
mooue any Christian heart to a reuerent receiuing and vsing thereof: but when Christ Iesus himselfe, in his owne person, hath immediately instituted it, yea and was himselfe a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of it, yea the first Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of it, what a fearefull iudgement are they guilty of, that shall prophane and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace that which Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, in his owne person, so exceedingly graced and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured?</p>
                  <p>This doctrine also serueth as a singular motiue to stirre vp all the faithfull to a most care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full respect and regard of this mysterie. For first those ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances which Christ himselfe hath expresly and in a speciall manner instituted, ought with speciall reuerence to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed vnto. The seruices
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:19920:14"/>
which are required by the lawes of man, framed once by consequence from the word, or but according to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall rules thereof, are in a holy and religious manner to bee performed. But such a seruice as Christ himselfe shall imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately and so expresly insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, not trusting to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course and wit of man to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the same, and which himselfe did most religiously in his owne person performe, must needs deserue the highest respect and reuerence, and must needs argue great impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in them that shal contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuously, or but carelesly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the same. 2. In that himselfe did first not only insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, but administer it; it tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs, that wee should al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies receiue it from the hands
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:19920:14"/>
of Christs Ministers, euen as it were from the hands of Christ himselfe, who, though not bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, yet is as spiritually and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually present now, as at the first administration thereof.</p>
                  <p>The third point of doctrine concerneth the circumstance of time,<note place="margin">The third point of doctrine concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> that Christ in his spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall wisdome made choise of to institute this Sacrament in, which was <hi>the night in which he was betraied.</hi> This also ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to mooue and perswade to a due and reuerent respect of this ordinance.</p>
                  <p>For first, that could not but proceed from the infinite loue of Christ, which at this time he instituted for his Church, when hee was preparing himselfe to the greatest worke of loue that euer was shewed, euen to lay downe his life for it. The le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacies
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:19920:15"/>
bequeathed by friends vpon their death beds, vse much to be esteemed, &amp; where they are contemned, there the loue of the giuer is despised and disgraced. If therefore the loue of Christ Iesus, when he was ready to lay downe his life for vs, bee deare and preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous vnto vs, this Sacrament, which at that very time was instituted by him, and, as a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacie, bequeathed vnto vs must needs be deare and preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous vnto vs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This was no time for Christ to spend in instituting needlesse and vnnecessary mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. The vainest men that are, or euer were, except they bee desperately wicked, or through some disease distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered in their braine, doe not vse at such a time to busie
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:19920:15"/>
themselues about vanities and needlesse matters, but their thoughts vse to bee taken vp with the most serious and weightiest affaires, such as most necessarily concerne themselues and their friends: Farre bee it therefore from vs, that wee should thinke, that our Sauiour at this time should finde nothing else to doe, but to trouble his Church with idle and friuolous obseruances. Yea, if men at such times as this is, how miserable soeuer, doe vse to bestow the best things they haue vpon them they most loue, we must either thinke that our Sauiour was very poore, or very miserable, or else we must hold, that this Sacrament, which at this time hee bequeathed vnto all his Churches, is of some speciall
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:19920:16"/>
price, value, and vse vnto the same, if it bee receiued as it ought to be.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, seeing that Christ at this time was entring vpon the greatest, most painfull and difficult worke that euer was or shall bee performed, euen the saluation of sinners, the zeale whereof had now, more than euer, eaten him vp, and had captiuated al the thoughts and affections of his soule, so that it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                     </gap> not possible for him (at this time) to thinke of any thing else, but what might further the worke of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and the saluation of our soules; we must needs conclude, that this Sacrament beeing duely (according to Christs intent) administred &amp; receiued, must needs tend, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a very speciall manner, to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:19920:16"/>
the furtherance of our saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to make the worke of his redemption effectuall vnto vs; so that to set light by this Sacrament, is to despise the worke of redemption, and the saluation of our soules.</p>
                  <p>The fourth point of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is concerning the parts of this Sacrament,<note place="margin">The 4. point of doctrine concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee can well vnderstand, something is to be premised of a Sacrament in generall, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of briefly:</p>
                  <p>This word [<hi>Sacrament</hi>] was wont to signifie that solemne oath which the souldiers of <hi>Rome</hi> vsed to take, whereby they bound themselues to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme faithfull seruice to their Emperour in his warres, from whence the Latine Diuines haue borrowed it, and now, by long custome, it is become
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:19920:17"/>
in these Westerne Churches, a proper name, whereby those outward badges and ensignes of Christianitie, (vz. Baptisme and the Lords Supper) are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; because that Christians, in the due receiuing of them, doe after a speciall manner binde themselues, euen as it were by a solemne vow and oath, to serue their Lord and Master Iesus Christ, euen as the souldiers of <hi>Rome</hi> did, by solemne oath, bind themselues to serue their Emperours and Commanders in the warre.</p>
                  <p>More particularly, wee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand by Sacraments those mysticall Rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Church, which Christ hath ordained for the setting foorth and confirming of the Couenant of grace.</p>
                  <p>Mysticall Rites and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:19920:17"/>
are certaine outward and bodily signes, which, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a secret and artificiall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, shadow and represent things spirituall and internall: so that in euery Sacrament there are these two things to bee considered. 1. The out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward bodily signe. 2. The spirituall matter, that is mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally shadowed by the signe, and yet, after a sort, hidden and locked vp in the same.</p>
                  <p>The Apostle, in setting downe the parts of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, expresseth both these points.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The outward signes which Christ hath instituted, are in themselues very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, ordinary, and vsuall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as <hi>breaking and eating of Bread, and drinking of Wine.</hi> Wine is not expressed heere:
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:19920:18"/>
but in <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. and <hi>Mar.</hi> 14. the fruit of the Vine is expresly mentioned by our Sauiour Christ, immediately after the institution.</p>
                  <p>These signes may bee redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to two heads: as 1. Vnto certaine outward elements: 2. Vnto certaine mysticall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in and about the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>The elements are Bread and Wine: the actions are break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and eating of the bread, and drinking of the Wine. These are all the mysticall signes which are expresly mentioned in this place of Scripture, and in the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists that write of the instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Sacrament; and therefore I wil not stand vpon any other, though I doe not deny but there are other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:19920:18"/>
actions performed in &amp; about these elements, which of the soundest Diuines are, and rightly may, in some sense, by analogie, be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Sacramentall.</p>
                  <p>These signes considered na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly in and by themselues, are not of any great force to stirre vp any great reuerence to the receiuing of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is no one thing in the world more ordinary than eating and drinking; and yet there is no iust cause why, in regard of them, we should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise and contemne the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they being in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues things both necessary, and pleasant, and no waies base and contemptible. If Christ Iesus should haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of vs any light and senselesse action, or which
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:19920:19"/>
should haue beene bitter and loathsome, or burdensome vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, yet wee ought, for his sake that requires it, to yeeld reuerent respect vnto it: much more when hee requires that which in it selfe is both neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie, profitable, and pleasant, as eating of bread and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of wine are. It had bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commed vs in all humilitie, (if so it had pleased him to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine) euen to haue eaten A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cornes, and husks, and swines meat, such as the prodigall son was forced to eat of; and to haue drunke vineger mingled with gall, such as Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, for our sakes, tasted of: much more will it beseeme vs, with all due reuerence and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, to eat bread, and drinke wine, vpon Christs will and pleasure, which is euer most
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:19920:19"/>
holy and blessed. But to let passe the outward signes in themselues, and to come to the mysterie in them, and to consider the one with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, wee shall then see great force in the parts of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to stirre vp in vs a speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all reuerence in the receiuing of it. There are many things of no honour in themselues, that in regard of some speciall vse that they are applied vnto, are honourable; as the white wand carried before Iudges, the Cap of Maintenance worn before the Lord Maior, the Sword borne before the King, &amp;c. which in regard of some speciall mysterie and meaning that is hidden in them, are mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of speciall grace and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; so though these outward signes bee not in themselues
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:19920:20"/>
honourable, yet in regard of the mysterie that is in them, they both bring honour to Christ, and are honourable to the vser.</p>
                  <p>The very circumstance of time wherein our Sauiour did administer it, sheweth vs, that this bread and wine, this eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drinking, hath in this place a more than ordinarie vse or end. Wee eat bread commonly to satisfie hunger, and to feed and nourish our bodies; and wee drinke wine to quench our thirst, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiue and refresh our heauy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: but this is not the proper end of the eating of this bread, or of the drinking of this wine. For then Christ would neuer haue administred it immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after supper, and that a festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:19920:20"/>
were to receiue it, were full of bread and wine before. And therefore in the receiuing of this Sacrament, wee must not so much looke (as wee doe in other eatings and drinkings) to satisfie our hunger, to fill our bellies, and to quench our thirsts; but in this eating and drinking, wee must looke to satisfie and fill our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>The mysteries then contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnder these signes, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed by them, are the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test that can be imagined, euen the great and high mysterie of our redemption and saluation by Iesus Christ; our faith and beleefe whereof, we doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse

                  <p>The breaking of the bread signifieth, in a mysterie, the breaking of Christs body, that is, all the vnspeakable tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that hee suffered in his own p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>The eating of the bread thus broken, and the drinking of this wine, signifieth the speciall fruit that commeth vnto all beleeuers, by the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and sufferings of Iesus Christ. For Christ saith;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:19920:21"/>
                     <hi>This Bread is my Body which was broken for you: And this Cuppe is the New Testament in my Blood.</hi> Or as hee speakes more plainly, <hi>Matt.</hi> 26.28. <hi>is my Blood in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that was shed for many for the remission of their sinnes.</hi> And therefore hee bids them <hi>take and eat</hi> the one, and <hi>drinke</hi> the other; as though hee should more plainly say vnto them: This bread, so broken as you see, shall bee a signe vnto you, and vnto all them that beleeue in my name, of that which I haue suffered in my flesh for you. The wine in this Cuppe shall bee a signe euen of the blood that in my Sacrifice vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the crosse was shed for you, to procure the pardon and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of your sinnes, and of all their sinnes that shall bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:19920:22"/>
in me, which is not the blood of Oxen and sheepe, such as were offred in the Old Testament, but is in very deed the blood of God and man, whereby the new Testament is sealed and ratified, which offreth saluation vnto al which shall beleeue in mee, and in the merits of this my blood: Therefore take ye and eat yee this mysticall bread, and drink this holy wine; and therein let it be a pledge vnto you and to all the faithfull that shall in like manner receiue the same, that the fruit of that which is shadowed thereby, belongs vnto you; so that as verily as you eat this bread, and drinke this wine with your bodilie mouths, so verily shall your soules taste of, and, as it were, eat and drinke of the fruits of

my death and passion, euen the remission of sinnes, and life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting.</p>
                  <p>Is not this Sacrament then a mysterie to bee trembled at and adored? Is it not a great indignitie, that men should brutishly, without all prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, come vnto the same, as an horse to the manger, or a swine to the trough? If it were but a bare and simple eating of bread and drinking of wine for bodily necessitie or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, we ought not like beasts, without any shew of reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, seaze vpon them; but ought in the receiuing of them, in some degree, lift vp our hearts to God for them: Much more when there is such an heauenly vse of these crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ouer and besides that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and common vse, which

cannot bee separated from them. It were a great indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie offered to the worke of our redemption, but occasionally to speake or thinke of it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out due reuerence: but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reuerence and honour vnto it then when vnder such a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall mysterie it is presented vnto vs, and when we are ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by called to a speciall conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of it; yea wherein it is of purpose represented to our senses, that we might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter behold it, and be stirred vp to praise and magnifie God for it: and which is more, when in a reuerend vse of this mysterie wee may spiritually partake euen of all heauenly things that are shadowed by it, what a sinne must this needs be, vnreuerently to rush vpon these holy Ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This sheweth, that speciall
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:19920:24"/>
thankes are due vnto GOD from vs for this Sacrament: For if Christ found cause to thanke God for it, much more cause haue wee, who reape all the fruit and benefit of it. And if the worthinesse of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament did draw thanks from Christ, it may challenge a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and reuerend acceptance of vs; yea it much more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes vs to administer and receiue the same with praier and thanksgiuing. And it is great prophanenesse for vs to presse vnreuerently vpon that which Christ himselfe would not enter vpon, without speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all praier; whereby hee suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently declareth, that this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is a speciall holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, and therefore to bee vsed holily, and not in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and vnreuerent maner.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:19920:24"/>
Jf Christ had but simply or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained it without any such speciall thanksgiuing or prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, it had beene our dutie not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, to receiue it with all due reuerence: But when he shall in this manner, by speciall praier, institute and administer it, it must needs be great impietie for vs to despise and contemne it, and not to make an high account and reckoning of it.</p>
                  <p>The Euangelist <hi>Matthew</hi> saith, <hi>Hee blessed the bread:</hi> i. By praier and thanksgiuing obtained a speciall blessing from God vpon it. For that which <hi>Balac</hi> said of <hi>Balaam</hi> may bee more truely said of Christ,<note place="margin">Num. 22.6.</note>

to remember, and in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring to meditate of Christ, and of his infinite loue and mercy towards vs, in the great worke of our Redemption, which is shadowed and set foorth by this Sacrament: When our speciall friends, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their departure <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And therfore seeing this Sacrament that was not onely left vnto vs by the greatest friend that euer we had, but left of purpose to be a remembrance &amp; a pledge vnto vs, of the greatest loue that euer was shewed to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall creatures, and which hath the very effects and fruits of the loue written vpon it, nay ingrauen in it, yea in some sort contained in it; is it a thing credible, that any that loue and beleeue in Christ Iesus, should prophane and lightly regard this Sacrament? But heere by the way we may obserue how strangely forgetfull euen those that are faithful, be of the great &amp; vnspeakable loue of Christ, that they stand in need of such a remembrance: for vnto them is this Sacrament giuen, as a
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:19920:27"/>
helpe to bring to their mindes the consideration of this loue. Is it possible that a man should forget the loue of such a Lord and Master, that hath with a great price of mony redeemed him from being a perpetuall Gally-slaue, yea who for to redeeme him, hath made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe a slaue, yea hath purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his seruants libertie with his owne death, and hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed vpon him all the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and dignities that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe had, and euen all that himselfe possessed? Were it not wonderfull that he should need a speciall remembrance when hee can no waies cast his eies, but hee shall behold the effects of his Lords loue? Would not one thinke that hee should rather need some meanes to make him forget
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:19920:27"/>
this loue, and to put it out of his head, rather than to bring it vnto his remembrance? This is the state and condition of all Christians; thogh Christ Iesus hath done a thousand times more for vs than is possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for one man to doe for an other, though whatsoeuer wee haue, we haue it by his mercie and loue, our soules, our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, our senses, our wit, our beautie, our wealth, our life; so that wee are compassed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with memorials of his kindnesse: and we cannot see, feele, heare, taste, or smell any thing, but it may put vs in minde of his loue, yea of his death and passion, by which the free vse of these things haue been purchased vnto vs: yet for all this, wee stand in need, you see, of speciall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrances;
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:19920:28"/>
yea and yet (O sinfull wretches that we are!) wee are ready to prophane these speciall remembrances; yea, and which exceedeth all wonder, are prone, euen in the midst of them, most of all to forget the loue of Christ, and to dishonour him.</p>
                  <p>The end that respecteth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, is <hi>The shewing foorth of Christs death vntill hee come:</hi> i. By eating this bread, and drinking this wine, men shall testifie and professe, yea after a sort preach vnto others, euen vnto the worlds end, the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie of the Gospell, the summe and substance whereof consists in the death of Christ, and the fruits that flow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, shadowed and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented in this Sacrament; so that by our due receiuing of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:19920:28"/>
this Sacrament, wee doe, as it were, lead others by the hand into the garden in <hi>Gethse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,</hi> and shew them Christ Iesus sweating water &amp; blood; <hi>Iudas</hi> traiterously kissing and betraying him, and the souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers thereupon binding and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him to iudgement; wee lead them to <hi>Caiaphas</hi> Hall, and <hi>Pilates</hi> Throne, to shew them Christ most wickedly and vniustly condemned, buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feted and spit vpon, scourged and crowned with thornes; wee lead them to <hi>Mount Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarie,</hi> and shew them how he was nailed on the Crosse, how he was forced to drinke vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar mingled with gall, how he was pierced with a speare, how with most bitter cries he said, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> And all this for
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:19920:29"/>
our sakes, that he might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the forgiuenesse of our sinnes, and euerlasting saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Can wee in this mysterie see and behold al this with the eies of faith? Can wee, after a sort, shew them &amp; point them vnto others? And shall wee therewith be no whit affected in our owne soules? Shall wee come vnto this Sacrament as blocks and stocks, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny affection, as vnto a vaine, idle, and friuolous matter?</p>
                  <p>By this which hath beene said, you may see how forcible this doctrine of the Apostle, concerning the Sacrament, is, to stirre vp al Christians to the worthy receiuing of the same: But it may bee obiected, that the Apostles labour heerein seemes needlesse, and to no purpose, seeing the Church of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:19920:29"/>
                     <hi>Corinth</hi> could not be ignorant of any of these points, which the Apostle hath taught con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Sacrament: It is true indeed, they could not be ignorant of any of these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: But what then? Was <hi>Pauls</hi> doctrine therfore need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse and in vaine? No verily; but in this practise of <hi>Paul</hi> we are taught what a perpetuall vse there is of teaching in the Church of Christ, when the Ministers must bee faine to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct the people of God not only in that which they are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of, but often call vnto their minde and consideration that which they know already,<note place="margin">2.

could vnderstand euery hard and difficult place of Scripture, though they knew all the grounds and principles of the Christian faith, though they were able to answer all oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions against any diuine truth in the word; yet for all this, there would bee a vse of read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and preaching of the word of God in the Church. For if our knowledge be not stirred vp in vs, if wee bee not often put in minde of it, if we be not taught how to apply it vnto these and these particular ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, it will bee as it were dead in vs, and most out of our head when wee should most vse it: For so was the knowledge of this Sacrament in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> vntill the Apostle indeuoured to reuiue it by this Epistle; and so it will bee with
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:19920:30"/>
any part of diuine knowledge whatsoeuer, if there shall be no meanes in the Church often to stirre vp the same in vs, and to call vs to the true vse and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of it.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the first, we must know, that <hi>to receiue this Sacrament vnworthily,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">What it is to eat &amp; drinke vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily.</note> is to receiue the outward elementes thereof, without due reuerence and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, either of the mysterie that is contained in them, or of the end why they were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, or of the person by whose authoritie they were appointed. The ordinary and most common causes of this vnworthy receiuing, are these:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Ignorance, when men will presume to partake of these mysteries, before they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
<pb facs="tcp:19920:31"/>
stand and haue learned, in any reasonable sort, the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and vse of them; such must needs receiue<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> hand ouer head, they know not and care not what.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Want of special faith, when a man partakes of the outward elements of this Sacrament, and yet is not perswaded, nor doth beleeue, or expect, that any such special fruit or bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, as is promised in the word, shall redound vnto him by the same.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Superstition, when one commeth vnto this Sacrament in a fond conceit and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, that hee shall receiue other manner of blessings and benefits by it, than is reuealed or promised by the word, or intended by Christ.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Prophanenesse or sensuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:19920:32"/>
which is when a man doth so satiate and pamper his soule and body with the delights and pleasures of the world and the flesh, that he cannot, nor cares not to taste and relish the spirituall fruit that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth by this Sacrament, or any other diuine ordinance; and therefore brings vnto it no other hart nor affections, than vnto ordinarie meat &amp; drink, yea often times worse.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Carelesnesse and securitie, which is when a man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth with an affection and disposition vnto this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as vnto a matter that he neither looke; to receiue good by, nor feares to receiue hurt by; and therefore will neuer trouble his minde about the matter.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Presumption, which is,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:19920:32"/>
when men neuer care in what manner they receiue, and yet presume to receiue as much fruit and benefit by the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as those which are most carefull to fit &amp; prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues thereunto.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Vncharitablenesse, when a mans soule is so full of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, hatred, and malice of his neighbour, and by meanes thereof, so vexed and disquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that it cannot consider and meditate (as it ought to doe) of the loue of Christ figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in this Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>Many other causes of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy receiuing might bee alleged; but these are the vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and most ordinarie. Let vs then euery one take heed, that no one of them bee found in vs; for then we shall certainly prophane this Sacrament, and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:19920:33"/>
become vnworthy receiuers thereof, and so bee guiltie of that sinne which is heere men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by the Apostle. There is not the least of one of these, but they will make a man an vnworthy receiuer of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. What then is the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state of such persons, as are knowen to haue all these cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions abounding in them, and yet will (at the least once in the yeere) presume to come to the Table of the Lord? Thus much for the vnderstanding of the first point of the conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, vz. <hi>What is meant by vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy eating and drinking.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the second point in the conclusion,<note n="2" place="margin">What it is to bee guiltie of the body &amp; Blood of Christ.</note> 
                     <hi>To be guiltie of the Body and Blood of Christ,</hi> is, to offer a speciall wrong, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, and indignitie vnto the Body and Blood of Christ;
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:19920:33"/>
i. vnto the person and suffrings of Christ, and in a speciall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to sinne against the great worke of our redemption; yea it is in some sort to commit a sinne of the very same nature and qualitie, which they did, that had their hands in putting Christ Iesus to death. For eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that may truly bee said to be <hi>guilty of blood,</hi> is in some sense or other a shedder of blood. Euery vnworthy recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer then of this Sacrament, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the degrees of his vnworthy receiuing, either more or lesse, doth in some sort communicate euen in the sinne of <hi>Iudas</hi> that betraied Christ; of the wicked Iewes, that cried, Crucifie him; of <hi>Annas, Caiaphas,</hi> and <hi>Pilate,</hi> that condemned him; of the souldiers, that whipt and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:19920:34"/>
scourged him, that spet in his face, crownd him with thorns, nailed him on the Crosse, and pierced him with a speare. The worst of vs (I assure my selfe) doe abhorre these per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, euen for these sins which they committed against the person of Christ. Let vs then in like manner learne to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre the vnworthy receiuing of this Sacrament, which will pull vpon our heads the guilt of the same sinne, euen the blood of Iesus Christ, of which all vnwoorthy receiuers are heere said to be guiltie.</p>
                  <p>But in the third place it is to bee considered,<note n="3" place="margin">Why vnworthy receiuers are guilty of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Body &amp; Blood of Christ.</note> 
                     <hi>why vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy receiuers are guiltie of the Body and Blood of Christ.</hi> The answer vnto this question may easily bee gathered from the former doctrine of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:19920:34"/>
which is laid downe by the Apostle; for from that doth the Apostle inferre &amp; conclude the same.</p>
                  <p>First, because such persons, in so doing, doe despise the sacred authoritie of Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, who first instituted and administred this Sacrament, and ordained it to be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred and receiued in all his Churches, vntill the end of the world. Now they that despise the authoritie of Christ, must needs in some sort despise the person of Christ, and his suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frings, and by consequent, his Body and Blood, by which principally his authoritie is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified and confirmed: And to despise the person &amp; suffrings of Christ, the Body and Blood of Christ, what is it, but in some manner to assent vnto
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:19920:35"/>
them that nailed the Bodie of Christ vpon the Crosse, and shed the Blood of Christ?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they despise and set light by a speciall token of his loue and fauour, yea and memoriall of it, which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed vnto vs, euen when he was laying downe his life for vs, euen when he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be nailed on the crosse, and to shed his blood for vs. Now who can contemne and set light by this token, but hee must needs despise &amp; set light by the loue of Christ, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in of the body of Christ, which he gaue for vs, and the Blood of Christ, which hee shed for vs, wherein the speciall fruit of his loue appeared. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.7.8. And is not this in some sort to be guiltie of it?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they offer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:19920:35"/>
to the principall badges, cognizances, and ensignes of Christianitie, and, as it were, to the speciall coine &amp; picture of Christ, yea to a consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted type, shadow, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation of his body &amp; blood. Now that wilfull contempt and wrong which is offered vnto the cognizances, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes, coines, pictures, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations of a Prince, is supposed to be offered to the person it selfe of the Prince: And therefore the wrong that is offered, the carelesnesse, neglect, and contempt that is shewed to this Sacrament, must needs redound to the Body and Blood of Christ, yea vnto the whole mysterie of redemption shadowed and represented by the same;<note place="margin">Rom. 4.11.</note> yea forasmuch as in this Sacrament
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:19920:36"/>
the very Body and Blood of Christ,<note place="margin">Gen. 17.10.11. Luc. 22.18. Tit. 3.9.</note> and all the benefits thereof are spiritually offered vnto the receiuer, euen as lands are offered vnto men by the sealing and deliuerie of Deeds and Jndentures; to make no account of, but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise this Sacrament, is as much as to despise the Body and Blood of Christ, and all the benefits thereof; as he may be said to despise the lease or gift of lands, which despiseth the Writings, Seales, and Jn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentures, whereby they are secured and confirmed vnto him.</p>
                  <p>Thus you see how the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle hath shewed what a feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and dangerous sinne it is to prophane this Sacrament: And hee hath not barely affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it, but prooued it by most
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:19920:36"/>
euident and apparant reasons. Let vs from this conclusion of the Apostle, thus explaned and laid open, obserue these points:</p>
                  <p>First, that Christ Iesus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth strange indignity and wrong in his very person, not from Iewes and Infidels only, but often times from Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, euen from such as looke to bee saued by the merits of his blood; and that euen then, when they are pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>forming speciall seruice and worship vnto him. For what greater wrong can there bee, than to be guiltie of that blood, which is the price of our redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? which was the sinne of this Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and is the sinne of all such pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>sons as are vnworthy receiuers of this Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:19920:37"/>Secondly, this shewes that the bare conformitie vnto the outward exercises of Religion, whether the word or Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is not enough to make vs good Christians, but men may be the worse Christians for this, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.28. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.1.2.3.4.5.6. Many simple ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant soules doe thinke that they haue Religion and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianitie enough in them, if their foreheads haue beene sprinkled with the water of Baptisme, &amp; if they sometimes heare the word and receiue the outward elements of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; whereas in very deed they may be further from Christianitie, for their outward conformitie vnto these things, than if they did not conforme vnto them at all: They may by eating t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>is Bread, and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:19920:37"/>
this Cup, euen as it were, crucifie Christ Iesus, and tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple his blood vnder their feet. Christians therefore must not only striue to worship God, to heare the word, to pray, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the Sacraments, but to doe it in that reuerend forme and maner that God requires; otherwise they may doe it in such a manner, that they shall more offend God in doing of it, than if they did it not at all. It were better a thousand times for vs neuer to receiue this Sacrament, than to receiue it in such a manner, as shall for the very act of receiuing, pull vpon our heads the guilt of that blood.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, by this it appeares, that this sinne of vnworthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing (if wee doe not seeke atonement and reconciliation
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:19920:38"/>
betime for the same, at the hands of God) will be a heauy sinne vpon our consciences. For to bee guilty of blood, though of sinfull and wicked blood, hath beene a burden that hath made the stoutest heart to ake. But who is able, when his conscience shall bee awakened, to beare the guilt of innocent blood? And if the blood of innocent <hi>Abel</hi> was so heauy to <hi>Cain. Gen</hi> 4.13. how heauy shall the blood of the innocent lambe of God lie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all them that are any way guilty of it? We may see how heauy it was vpon the heart of <hi>Iudas, Matt.</hi> 27.3<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 4 5. yea and how heauy it is, euen to this day, vpon the heads of the whole Nation of the Iewes, according to their own cursed wish, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.25. This sin
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:19920:38"/>
therefore beeing a kinde of bloody sinne, and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, a most heauy and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable sinne, can wee be too carefull to auoid it? It is not our ignorance or good meaning, in this case, that will excuse vs, and free vs from the guilt of it. Many of the Iewes did in their ignorance, crucifie Christ, <hi>Luc.</hi> 23.34. <hi>Act.</hi> 3.17. And the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> had (no doubt) a good mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in receiuing this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, euen then when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued it most vnworthily; yet this could not free them from the guilt of Christs blood: This may lessen the guilt; it cannot take it away. If this will not mooue vs to a carefull preparation before wee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to be made partakers of this Sacrament, nothing will.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:19920:39"/>Fourthly, note the different effect of this Sacrament in the worthy and vnworthy recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers thereof. It is the sauour of death vnto death to some, to other some the sauour of life vnto life, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16. The soule of the worthy receiuer is fed and refreshed, washed, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, and cleansed from sinne by the body &amp; blood of Christ receiued therein. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie side, the soule of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy receiuer is polluted and defiled, and made accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and miserable thereby; and the oftener hee receiueth the same, the more abominable he is in the sight of God and man. And such as do in such a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner receiue the bodie and blood of Christ, and looke for grace thereby, are as if they that whipt Christ, and that
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:19920:39"/>
nailed him on the Crosse, and by meanes thereof, had their faces, hands, and garments all to be sprinkled with his gore blood, should thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues thereby purged from their sinnes; or as if hee which pierced Christ with a speare, should haue held a Challice at the wound, and haue filled it with the blood that issued therefrom, and so haue ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouzed it off, and should think thereby to haue drunken to his owne eternall health, the blood of Christ.</p>

may bee auoided, and so wee may become worthy receiuers of these mysteries.</p>
                  <p>The meanes are, <hi>A due tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and examination of our selues,</hi> which he leaues not to our libertie, to doe, or not to doe, but requires it at our hands, as a necessarie dutie: The former danger then of committing so grieuous a sin, must not withold vs from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing the Sacrament, but it must make vs so much the more studious to vse the means of worthy receiuing of the same. For the Apostle doth not say: Let a man therefore forbeare to receiue this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but let a man trie and examine himselfe, and so let him eat this bread and drinke this Cup; So that the more dangerous it is to receiue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woorthily,

                     <p>The Triall and examination here required, is a most care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and diligent search and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition to bee made within our owne Soules and conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whether there bee in vs, those gifts and graces that are necessary to the worthy and reuerent receiuing of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament yea or no; i. Whether we be such Persons as haue an interest in this Sacrament or no? And for the finding out of this, we must try our selues af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that manner that Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smiths
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:19920:42"/>
by touch and fire and hammer, do vse to try whether Gold or Siluer be pure, yea or no.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 This sheweth, that the principall gifts and graces of God that are in a man, are not alwaies euident and apparant vnto him, but doe sometimes lie hid within the secret of the soule, vntill by some speciall triall, they bee discouered and discerned; for if the said graces did alwaies manifest them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, then there should neuer neede any such triall of our selues. This should encourage vs to search our selues, so much the more narrowly; for if by our searching, wee shall finde but one grace, yea or one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of a grace in our soule, more than we did perceiue in our selues before, it will
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:19920:42"/>
bring more sound comfort and ioy vnto our soules, than if we had found the most pretious iewell in the world.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 By this it appeares, that a man may (if hee will carefully vse the meanes) come to some knowledge and sight of that grace and goodnesse which is in his owne soule: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it must needs bee a great fault in them that doe not carefully vse the meanes. It is a signe they set no price of Gods grace, that make no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirie whether they haue it or no in their possession. Men make diligent inquirie after concealed land and treasures; much more should they make enquirie after the concealed graces of God, that lie hid in their owne soules, and which they cannot imploy as they

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:19920:44"/>
or haue an interest therein, but a true Christian; and whosoeuer is a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, (if he stirre vp the grace of God that is in him) he may bee a worthy and fruitfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuer thereof.

Againe, this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:19920:44"/>
being one of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward badges and cognizances of Christ Iesus, which he hath appointed for his seruants to weare, it must needs bee, that hee whom Christ Iesus hath graced so much, as to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine into his seruice, may be, in some degree, worthy to weare this badge and cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance.</p>
                     <p>That grace which makes vs indeed true Christians,<note place="margin">Act. 8.3 37. Rom. 4.22.</note> is a true and liuely faith in Iesus Christ.

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:19920:45"/>
according to the growth of it, doe they grow and increase; and they that haue but the least degree thereof, are true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, though but weake and imperfect, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.20. <hi>Esai</hi> 42.3. and haue an interest in Christ and his merits, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a right into this Sacrament; so that in this triall and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of our selues, it shall suffice, that we can finde this true and liuely faith in vs, though in neuer so small a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. For when we haue once found this grace in our soules, and stirred it vp, it will supply vnto vs all such other graces as shall make vs in some measure worthy receiuers. For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer is done in faith, (how simple and base soeuer the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction may seeme to bee) is pleasing &amp; acceptable to God:
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:19920:45"/>
and on the contrarie side, whatsoeuer is done, and is not of faith, is not pleasing or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable vnto him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.23. So that all the worth of a Christian lies in his faith, and in those fruites which spring from faith.</p>

The faith with resteth vpon any other ground-worke, is no true sauing faith. The speciall meanes to trie whether our

faith bee grounded vpon the word of God, is, to examine our consciences in these parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars:</p>
                     <p>First, whether wee doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue indeed and in truth, that the writings of the Prophets and Apostles, in the Old and New Testament, are the very word of God. For the whole word of God, so far as is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to be beleeued vnto salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is contained therein<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 
                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.39. Or at the least, whether wee bee exceedingly troubled and grieued in our soules, and from our very hearts, when, through any temptation, wee are mooued to doubt of the same: And whether wee vse all the meanes we can to come to a perswasion thereof. For God accepts the will and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour for the deed, <hi>Marke</hi>
                        <pb n="81" facs="tcp:19920:46"/>
9.24. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.18. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.6.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, whether we doe vnfainedly desire to be taught and instructed in the word of God, and to come to the true knowledge and vnderstanding thereof; and whether wee doe loue and affect those meanes which are most powerfull and effectuall to that end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. For hee whose faith is grounded vpon the word<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> hath his hope grounded vpon the same word, euen all the hope he hath of euerlasting life, and therefore hee must needs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to bee acquainted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with by all possible meanes.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, whether our igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and dulnesse in vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of the word, and our forgetfulnesse thereof, be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous and troublesome vnto
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:19920:47"/>
vs. For how can it chuse but grieue &amp; trouble a man, when hee knowes not, nor vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands not, or cannot remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the euidence of his owne euerlasting estate?</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, whether our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, or hearing the word read or preached; our medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, conference and studie of it, doe increase or nourish our loue, and delight, and beleefe in it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.92.97.98. 103.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, whether wee giue credit and authoritie vnto it aboue all humane traditions &amp; customes whatsoeuer, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.113. And whether wee doe not denie credit and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe vnto whatsoeuer wee know is repugnant vnto the same word.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, whether wee finde
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:19920:47"/>
a lightnesse and cheerefulnesse in our consciences when wee haue done any thing agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto the word of God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.92. And whether wee finde a trouble and a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinesse in the same, when wee haue done any thing which we know to be repugnant vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the same word.</p>
                     <p>Seuenthly, whether wee hope in the promises, feare the threatnings, desire the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, and endeuour to auoid the curses contained in this word: And whether wee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually beleeue the one as well as the other.</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, whether wee doe iudge it a singular blessing of the Lord, that he hath in this manner reuealed his will in the written word, and that hee vouchsafeth vs libertie and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:19920:48"/>
meanes to come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, vnderstanding, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe of it; and whether wee iudge it to bee a great iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and curse vpon them, from whom this word is hid, and who want this liberty and meanes that we enioy.</p>
                     <p>Ninthly, whether wee can prooue those points of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and faith, which wee doe hold and beleeue, by the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word of God; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we doe therefore beleeue them, because we know they are affirmed in the word of God; and whether doe wee misdoubt and suspect all those points of Religion that wee cannot see warranted by the word of God.</p>
                     <p>If wee can finde these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties in our soules, then haue we found in vs so many infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:19920:48"/>
signes and tokens, that our faith hath a true and sound ground.</p>
                     <p>Secondly we are to trie and examine our faith in Christ,<note n="2" place="margin">The tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of our faith by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> obiect or matter thereof.</note> whether it be true and liuely, no or yea, by the obiect and matter thereof.</p>
                     <p>The obiect &amp; matter of true faith, is that diuine truth which God in his word hath reueled vnto vs. For if the testimony of God in his word, bee the ground of our faith; then that truth which is reuealed in the word, must needs be the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect and matter thereof. Now forasmuch as, there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer any one man, that could e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer attaine vnto the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all and euery particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar truth reuealed in the word of God, the meanes heerein to t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>For the Apostle requires him that examineth himselfe, <hi>To eat of this Bread, and to drinke of this Cuppe.</hi> What? is he to doe this, whether in this search and triall he shall finde any grace in himselfe or no? To what end then should a man make any such trial? This then is certaine, that a man is not to receiue this Sacrament, except after triall, hee finde in
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:19920:61"/>
himselfe some degree &amp; mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of that grace which may make him a worthy receiuer. But why doth not the Apostle put in this caution and excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? First, because he would therein teach all Christians, so long to continue the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and triall of themselues, vntil they haue found the grace aboue specified in themselues. Secondly, to shew that a man hath not tried and examined himselfe in that manner which the Holy Ghost intendeth and meaneth, vntill hee haue found in himselfe some degrees of that true sauing faith, of which wee haue formerly intreated: And thirdly, to teach that hee that hath this grace, but to search and trie earnestly and seriously, whether hee haue faith, shall bee sure, in good
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:19920:61"/>
time, to finde faith in himselfe, if he haue an vnfained desire to finde it. And if this seeme scant probable by this place, let the precise promise of Christ, <hi>Luc.</hi> 11.5.14. who saith, <hi>Seeke and yee shall finde,</hi> confirme the same vnto you.</p>
                     <p>What an encouragement then ought this to be vnto eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of vs, to rifle and ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacke our owne soules, and to search narrowly euery corner of them for this faith, euen as one would search for a mine of gold, seeing wee haue such a hope and firme promise, that if wee search with a desire to finde, we shall be sure to finde it; and if we finde it, we shall not finde it alone, but with it, and in it, a sealed pardon of the forgiuenesse of all our sins, yea and sure Euidences and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:19920:62"/>
Indentures of a firme title to the kingdome of Heauen. If a poore condemned man were credibly certified of this, that if he did but carefully search a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, he should finde the kings pardon; or if a needy begger were certainely informed of this, that if hee would make a diligent search, hee should bee sure to finde such treasures of gold and siluer, as would make him a great rich man as long as euer hee shall liue afterward; would any man pitty either the pouertie of the one, or the death of the other, if they should refuse in those cases to take pains to make a diligent search and triall? Much lesse are any such to be pitied, that may finde the sauing grace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid for the seeking of it, and yet will not bestow the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:19920:62"/>
paines to seeke it, or to make any serious inquitie after it; verily there cannot bee a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter signe, that a man despiseth the grace of God, than in such a case as this, not to seeke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it, especially seeing a man may bee sure to haue it for the seeking for.</p>

                     <p>First, that all Christians,

that are bound to receiue, are bound to make this triall bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they receiue; and that it is a sin for any to eat this bread and to drinke this Cup, that haue not tried and examined themselues.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, that it is a sinne, not to eat this bread, and to drinke this Cuppe, after wee haue made a due triall of our selues.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, that they which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the triall and examination of themselues, doe vnworthily eat this Bread, and drinke this Cuppe, did neuer diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and seriously trie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.</p>

                     <p>The person that is to make this triall, is a mans selfe, in and vpon himselfe. <hi>Let a man therefore,</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>examine himselfe, and so let him eat, &amp;c.</hi> And the reason there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is euident; for it is not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, that another man should be able to trie the soundnes of our faith, which is known only to God and our owne consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. For though a man should vse never so many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, and trie neuer so many conclusions vpon vs, yet may wee through our hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie and cunning dissimulation, cozen and delude the wisest men and the most cunning In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitors in the world; yea,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:19920:64"/>
our owne hearts are so full of fraud and guile, that if in this triall and examination of our selues, wee doe not proceed by a sound and sincere rule, our selues shall exceedingly cosen and deceiue our selues, and wee shall conceit that grace to be in our hearts, which was neuer in them in deed and truth. Doth not experience teach vs that some persons haue made great shew of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and faith, and haue made a more than ordinary professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof, insomuch as they haue seemed, not onely to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but no doubt, euen vnto themselues to burne in zeale and loue, vnto the truth of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ; which yet haue af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward proued vile Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taes, and wicked and maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous persecutors of that grace
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:19920:64"/>
in others, which themselues haue formerly professed? Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily the Lord seldome leaues his Church without some such notorious example or other of this kinde, that Christians might the more narrowly trie and examine themselues, and that they might take heed that their corrupt hearts doe not deceiue them with semblances and shewes of grace, in stead of substances.</p>
                     <p>Let vs learne hence, first that this examination and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of our selues doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the triall and examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which others (as farre as they are able) are to make of vs, especially our Gouernors, Teachers, and Instructers, such as haue the cure and charge of our soules; but it rather streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theneth and confirmeth the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:19920:65"/>
same. For they which shall in singlenesse of heart once set themselues vnto this worke, to sift and winnow their owne soules, and to search and trie them, whether the grace of God be firmly rooted in them or no, shall find it a worke of that difficultie, that they will be glad of any furtherance and direction that they can get: For these trials and examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that others vse to take of vs, are but helpes and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, how wee may in the best manner trie and examine our selues. Those therefore which are so ready to conclude from hence, that others haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to doe to examine them before they receiue, because they are commanded <hi>to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine themselues,</hi> they might as well conclude, that no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:19920:65"/>
else is to care or prouide for them, or to looke vnto them, or to doe them good, because themselues are to care for, to looke vnto, to prouide and doe good for themselues. But this is the very truth of the matter; Such persons as are not willing that others should examine and trie them, doe neuer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend and purpose to examine themselues; and they shewe themselues to bee guilty to themselues of ignorance and gracelesnesse, yea and to affect the same, in which they had rather liue and rot, than disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to others, though they might haue helpe thereby.</p>
                     <p>Indeed if this were the end of our trials &amp; examinations, to find out the defects, and wants &amp; infirmities of our brethren, to the end that they might
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:19920:66"/>
be punished for them, or to the end that we might contemne &amp; deride them for the same, there were some colour to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept against it. But when the intent of this examination, is to know what spiritual grace the examinant wanteth, to this end that his want might bee supplied; is it not strange, that any should be found so vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to submit vnto the same, and should count it as a great iniurie and wrong? If a rich man should come vnto a poore man, and in pittie and loue should examine him of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, desiring him to tell him what he wants, whether mony or corne, or any other victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als for his wife and children, and should offer to assure him, that if hee would discouer his want, hee would doe his best,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:19920:66"/>
according to his power, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue him, were hee not a strange poore man, if hauing not one penny in the world to releeue his want, and if him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, his wife, and children, were ready to starue for hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, hee should murmur and grudge at this rich man, and aske him what hee had to doe to examine him? Verily thus it is with many poore ignorant soules amongst vs; the more they stand in need of spirituall helpe, the lesse they can endure to be examined of those which offer in loue to help them, and to doe their best to supply their spirituall wants, if they might know them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, this is not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to make a man a worthy receiuer of this Sacrament, that vpon triall and examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:19920:67"/>
made by others, he is found worthy; but a man is bound to approoue himselfe vnto himselfe. A man may by wise and politicke carriage so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meane himselfe, that all men, euen the best and holiest, after that they haue sifted and tried him to the vttermost, shall find no iust matter of reproofe in him: And many beare this minde, that if they can behaue themselues so as no man else can accuse them of any iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, though they bee guiltie to themselues and their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences of neuer so many se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret corruptions, that then they are worthy enough of Christ, and of this Sacrament, and of all the prerogatiues of Christians. But heere wee are taught, in this precept of the Apostle, neuer to iudge our
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:19920:67"/>
selues tried and approoued e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, but when wee are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued vnto our owne soules and consciences. For the stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctest Inquisitors in the world may free and acquit vs, when our owne consciences haue a thousand capitall crimes to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, conuict, and condemn vs of. Let vs not therefore in the matter of our owne wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines, so much relie vpon the iudgment of any man or al the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> in the world, as of our own soules &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>sciences, which are better able to iudge of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward state, than are all the men in the world besides. But most men iudge themselues Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians worthy inough, if no man be able to lay any vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines vnto their charge; but if this had been true, the Apostle would haue sent vs to others,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:19920:68"/>
to trie and examine vs, and not vnto our selues.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 This shewes that the principall graces, required in a worthy receiuer of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, are such as may bee in a christian, and yet not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lie hidden from the eies of others, but also of a mans own soule. For otherwise a man should not need in this manner to be commanded, to trie and examine himselfe, if so be hee could alwaies see what is in his owne soule and heart; or if so be that the sauing graces of God whensoeuer they are in the soule, should presently shew themselues to the eie of our soule; do we not by daily experience see, that the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiest christians do vse to iudge themselues of all other the most vnworthie; and are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:19920:68"/>
times most deiected with the sense and feeling of their own defects &amp; wants, &amp; that euen of such graces, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with their soules aboue others are richly adorned? The best then haue need to performe this duty to themselues. and surely it is an infallible signe that that man wants that which should make him a worthy receiuer, which is not carefull by diligent triall and examination, to assure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, that that grace is in him, which may in some measure make him a worthy receiuer.</p>
                     <p>By this also it appeares, that it is not inough for a man to be a worthy receiuer, but he must also know that he is one: and that he that knowes not himselfe to be one in some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree or other, cannot be such
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:19920:69"/>
a one as hee ought to bee.</p>

                     <head>5 Of the motiues whereby wee ought to be prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vnto this Triall.</head>
                     <p>The motiues vnto this duty of triall and examination fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, taken from the dangers that come by the neglect ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which are threefold, one depending vpon another.</p>
                     <p>The first danger is; that such as neglect this duty, <hi>doe not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scerne the body of Christ</hi>; that is, they do not or cannot, as they ought to do, discerne and make a difference between this bread &amp; wine, and that which at ordinary feasts we eat and drinke: They do not meditate of, and consider, the great my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery that is shaddowed and represented by them, that is, the mystery of redemption consisting in the sacrifice of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:19920:69"/>
the body, and shedding of the blood of Christ.</p>
                     <p>The second danger arising from the former is this: <hi>That they, not discerning of that which is mystically shadowed &amp; represented in this Bread and Wine, do eat and drinke the same vnworthily.</hi> That is, vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerently, carnally, profanely, not as becommeth men that partake of such high and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly mysteries.</p>
                     <p>The third danger arising from the other two, is this: <hi>That by this meanes, they ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and drinking vnworthily, doe therein, eat and drinke their owne iudgement or damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> That is, in stead of receiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by this action of theirs, any spirituall food tending to their saluation, they do by this acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, pull downe the iudgement
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:19920:70"/>
of God vpon them, and bring themselues in danger of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction and condemnation, because they do profane, and irreligiously abuse, through the want of due consideration and preparation, this heauenly Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, in comming vnto it after an vnreuerent and vnho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie manner, without all due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard for what intent and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it was instituted of Christ. Of these points we haue suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently intreated before. To conclude this matter; what more effectuall argument could the Apostle vse, to stir vs vp to this triall than this? If God should turne these ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Bread and Wine, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a bodily bane and poison, vnto all such of vs as should vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily receiue them, would it not then make vs come in
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:19920:70"/>
feare &amp; trembling with all due preparation vnto the same? Would it not make vs againe and againe, to trie &amp; examine our selues, and to be sure that we be in some measure worthy to receiue this Sacrament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we presumed to partake thereof? How much more ought the consideration of the danger heere specified, to moue vs thereunto? It were sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer and better for vs a thousand times, that the Sacrament should bee turned vnto a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily poison vnto vs, and that vpon our vnworthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing of it, our bowels and intrales should rot, after wee haue beene made partakers of it, than that in eating &amp; drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thereof, wee should eat and drinke our owne damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; euerlasting iudgement,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:19920:71"/>
which euery soule is in danger to do, that neglecteth the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this duty.</p>
                     <p>For the preuention heereof therefore, let vs carefully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue the two former causes of this iudgement.</p>
                     <p>First, Let vs indeuour with all holy reuerence and feare, <hi>to come worthily,</hi> and as it becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth holy Christians, vnto this Sacrament.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, that wee may come worthily thereunto, let vs labour <hi>to discerne the Body of Christ therein,</hi> not comming to this Table, as to an ordinary or common drinking, but comming thereto with a soule hungring and thirsting after that blessed Body and Blood of Christ, which vnder this bread and wine is figured and shadowed vnto vs, and, in a
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:19920:71"/>
spirituall manner, offered in the same vnto euery worthy Receiuer and Communicant: Which if wee shall carefully performe, then shall our soules and spirits bee truely satisfied with the body and blood of Christ; so that as verily as wee with our bodily mouthes, doe eat and drinke the outward fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures and signes, and are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created &amp; refreshed by them, so verily doe our soules, after a spirituall manner, by faith, as it were, eat and drinke the thing signified, to the euerlasting comfort and saluation both of our bodies and soules.</p>
                     <p>The Lord, for his mercie sake, forgiue our former want of Preparation, and moue our hearts to the carefull perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of these duties, that so wee may not onely auoid the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:19920:72"/>
iudgements which vnworthy Receiuers are in danger to fall into, but that wee receiuing worthily these holy mysteries, may in them, and by them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the assurance of that grace and mercy that is sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed and represented by them, euen the full and perfect redemption of our bodies and soules, through the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Christs body, and his most pretious blood shed vpon the Crosse. Amen.</p>

                  <p>A. First, it hath beene the practise of Gods church, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in the word, to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the Sacraments in so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne assemblies.</p>

                  <p>Fourthly, in the vse of the Sacraments, we <note n="b" place="margin">

                  <p>Fifthly, the dignity and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence due to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments requireth that they should bee administred pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely in the assembly of all Gods people, and with the praiers of all.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, it may appeare that in this Sacrament the Lord requireth this solemnitie more then in any other hee hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen at any time to his Church; because in it he hath instituted such elements, as might bee common to the whole Church; and <note n="e" place="margin">

and ordained it for this end (among others) to testifie and confirme the mutuall loue that should be in all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full one towards another.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Doe you then condemne all such, as being vnable to come to the congregation, doe desire this Sacrament to bee admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred to them in priuate?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> No, but first al Christians are to be taught, that they may not put off the receiuing of this Sacrament till their sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, but receiue it when they may with the rest of Gods people in the publike congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; and that it is their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and infirmitie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire it in priuate.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if at any time (vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on extraordinary occasion) the Sacrament be administred in a priuate house, yet ought a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, because as they shall swerue therein from the example of the best instructed and reformed Churches and Christians, so they shall fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themselues to such as are ignorant, popish and profane, with whom these priuate communions euer haue beene and still are most in vse.</p>

                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:19920:108"/>Thirdly, because they shall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> not heereby depriue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues of the comfort and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Sacrament in their sicknesse, or in the houre of their death, if they doe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it at that time; seeing the efficacy and fruit of this Sacrament which they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the publik congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on when they were in health, is not to be restrained to the time of receiuing, but extends it selfe to the whole time of their life afterward.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, because it is <note n="f" place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 4.3.10. 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.25.</note> folly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> and superstition to giue that honor or ascribe that neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie to the Sacrament, as to thinke it can doe vs good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing receiued or vsed other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then according to Gods ordinance; whereas on <note n="g" place="margin">

                        <hi>Esa.</hi> 63.27</note> hardnesse and senslesnesse of heart, which wee thus feele and bewaile in our selues, is a certaine signe that wee are in the state of grace, and (our conscience bearing witnesse with vs, that we came rightly prepared vnto it) we haue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly receiued comfort and fruit by it, <note n="d" place="margin">
