            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Though you wonder, yet blame not my denial. A proceedure so new as this, seems to have something in it inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable, but when you shall learn, what at present I must not acquaint you with, you will then at least not condemn it: all that I can now say to you is, That the liberty I take ought not to make you think any thing to my disadvantage.</p>

               <p>Is not your Mistress an unreasonable woman to make a young Gentleman to rise at break of day to meet her, and then to pop him off with so short a visit; to leave him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out shewing him her face: to say she'd come again within half an hour, and to break her promise and ne'r go near him since?

            <sp>
               <speaker>San.</speaker>
               <p>As a true Servant I must do my Masters business First I am his Ambassador, and must not depart without you first give me Audience.</p>

               <p>The truth is, not having my Credentials about me, I shall appear rather a Spy than an Ambassadour. I will take their advice, and keep my distance. I have no great stock of valour to repel dangers; therefore I will make use of my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, and like a wise man keep out of harms way— Auh, they are gone in, by their threatnings that must be the place of their abode: and I'le wait here about awhile to see if they don't take harbour here to shake me off.

               <p>In this rancounter he received an appointment to meet an unknown Lady, early this morning, at the Church of St. <hi>Dominick.</hi>

               <p>We obeyed the summons, the Lady came punctual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to her assignation, but after a few Ceremonies, and a little pritle pratle on both sides, the Lady withdrew, promising to

               <p>I heard all, and am amaz'd at her infidelity. Love was never declar'd in more kind and obliging expressions, than I receiv'd from her last night at parting. I'le give her a visit whilst my rage is arm'd with scorn, and upbraid her with her dissimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and ungrateful infidelity.</p>

               <p>I find you very full of temerity in presuming to say you abandon me.

know, before I take my leave of you, that it is to be for ever; and that your lingring in the Church longer as you have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly done, expecting that I should come and make my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses to you, will now signifie nothing, and if I go or come by your house, or stand still near it, it shall not be out of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign that you should send <hi>Beatrice</hi> to invite me in.</p>

If I look out and smile, interpret it not kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but in derision of your folly. And since you are so kind to promise me never to come here again, I will be so civil to dismiss you now without further ceremony, and deal really with you, and let you know, <hi>I</hi> wish with all my heart that you were already gone.</p>

               <p>You do assure it me with an indifference too great to make me in the least doubt of what you say; in what I spake, there was something I know not what of passionate, which sufficiently discovers, if you had a mind to observe it, that I love you still, though you deserve it not: But the cruel indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference that you have now shewn, makes it plainly appear, you never had any true love for me; and so Madam I'le be preparing to take my leave. <hi>Beatrice,</hi> prithee give me a glass of your fair water.

               <speaker>Iac.</speaker>
               <p>What was his reason at first to conceal you from <hi>Don Guzman</hi>? and e're since he came to be his Ghest, to confine you to the back apartment of his house, and tell him you are out of town?</p>

               <speaker>Elv.</speaker>
               <p>For fear any thing should be discours'd to my prejudice, if it was known that <hi>Don Gusman</hi> had a lodging so near me. Have you still sight of 'em <hi>Iacinta</hi>?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Iao.</speaker>
               <p>Yes Madam, the House must be hereabouts that they look for, by their hankering so. But Madam, the same reason continuing still, why does <hi>Don Ruis</hi> now order you to go to your Aunts, and to come home to his House in her Coach an hour hence; as if you were just come out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Elv.</speaker>
               <p>I objected the same, when I received his orders. And he told me that was but a pretended reason. And that the true ground of my concealment was, that he had information there would be some Overtures of a marriage with me, made to him by <hi>Don Francisco de Medina</hi>; of whose Revenue my Brother is a greater admirer than ever <hi>I</hi> shoud have been of his Person. And that some dayes since he heard his Applications are elsewhere, and his affections deeply en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Iac.</speaker>
               <p>That no doubt is the true reason.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Elv.</speaker>
               <p>And since the, friendship betwixt my Brother and <hi>Don Gusman</hi> is much increas'd. My Brother has acquainted him with the love of <hi>Octavia</hi>: that <hi>Don Diego</hi> is his Rival, and that his pretentions are rewarded with the favours which his fidelity more justly merits. <hi>Don Gusman</hi> on the other side has

given him a relation of our assignation, and what pass'd this morning; of <hi>Sanco</hi>'s success in pursuit of the vail'd Lady; and of his present coming abroad with design to walk under the window. All this my Brother told me, to let me see the difference, betwixt my manner of living, and that of many other Ladies, who hazard the honour of their Families, by the indiscreet liberty they take, and applauds the Life <hi>I</hi> lead, ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing all to his care, and conduct of me.</p>

               <p>Madam, thus unexpectedly to surprise me with your presence, was the only way you had to make amends for your breach of promise to me this morning.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Elv.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, I came not now to make excuses for my self, but to complain of you. If <hi>I</hi> have broke my word it is by your example, and my not coming to you was your own fault.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gus.</speaker>
               <p>How Madam, is it possible? That I, who waited with a burning desire of seeing you again, should be the occasion of your not coming, which is the thing I now lament of. <hi>I</hi> am confounded to think how you should be worse than
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48498:14"/>
your word by the example of one, who so exactly kept his.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Elv.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> have evidence enough to justifie my complaint.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gus.</speaker>
               <p>If it be not a disparagement to seek a witness in a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, <hi>Sanco</hi> can testifie how diligent I was not to miss your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>San.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, my Master set a Memorandum on my nose and ears.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gus.</speaker>
               <p>I stir'd not from the place, but out of design to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move a Freind, whose presence, <hi>I</hi> fear'd, might interrupt your coming. But my Servant I planted there all the while to give me notice of your first approach. But if your find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him a sleep, as I did, has been the occasion; I revoke my act of mercy, and declare his fault unpardonable.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Elv.</speaker>
               <p>To render my self more intelligible, know that it is not of his neglect of duty, or your want of diligence that I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, but of your indiscretion; the greatest fault a Cavalier can be guilty of, is to publish the favours he receives from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of our Sex. I perceive by the colour that now rises in your face, that you already understand my meaning.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gus.</speaker>
               <p>Your Eyes, whose transcendant brightness easily pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates the thickness of that vail which covers them, are wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses too illustrious not to be believ'd. I confess I made a Friend my Confident, a Friend that till now I ever found dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet. but by what you inform me, I discover how much a Captive he is to you, and that the Empire you have over him has made his love do violence to his friendship.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Elv.</speaker>
               <p>You take me then to be the Mistress of your Freind.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Gus.</speaker>
               <p>Yes Madam, I take you to be <hi>Octavia de Pimentel,</hi> whom <hi>Don Ruis</hi> adores. And now I begin to lose the hopes I had conceiv'd. For how adorable soever you be, love ought not to make me undertake any thing to the prejudice of my Friend. Rather than add to the number of his Rivals by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering you my heart, I ought to lend him the assistance of my Sword to remove them he already has.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Elv.</speaker>
               <p>I do know <hi>Octavia,</hi> but I am not her.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gus.</speaker>
               <p>If you are not her, I ought then to have a quarrel with <hi>Don Ruis</hi>; who by divulging the secret, is guilty of a crime,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48498:15"/>
which nothing, but the interest of a Mistress could have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd excusable.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Elv.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Ruis</hi> is the best Friend you have. He told this to a person who hath given him as many proofs of fidelity, as you e'r receiv'd from him, and intended you no more harm in communicating it to that party, than you did me, when you related it to him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gus.</speaker>
               <p>If he has discours'd it to one only, and that person be yourself, I cannot but be of opinion that you are his Mistress, if you are not her, do me the grace for one moment, to grant me the sight of those many charms your cruel vail robs me of. I shall then know if my friendship be inconsistent with the love my heart is going to be possest with.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Elv.</speaker>

               <p>
                  <hi>Don Ruis</hi> often has shew'd me her picture, which out of devotion to her, he constantly wears about him: do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse me the happiness of being in a capacity to adore you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out inquietude.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Elv.</speaker>
               <p>You desire a thing, that is not fit for me to grant, till I have had a sufficient proof of your discretion. It may be if I had told you my name before, or shew'd you my face, you had then too reveal'd one, and describ'd the other. No, my repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is a thing that well deserves the best of my care with whom I entrust it. I'le see you again, as soon as I may safely tell you whom I am.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gus.</speaker>
               <p>Leave me not without some further assurances that <hi>I</hi> shall again be thus blest, and that e're long I shall see you in the full lustre of your charms.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Nothing shall hinder it, if to <hi>Don Ruis</hi> you do not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain reveal what is past.</p>

               <p>If I had not written the Note, <hi>Don Diego</hi> and you wou'd in probability never have had any more concern. Besides <hi>Sanco</hi> at that time belong'd not to you, but to me, since you were pleas'd to make me Master of him, and he was imploy'd in my business. So whether in concern of his Rival, or in consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of his Master, he gave <hi>Sanco</hi> the beating, it is to me on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the affront was done,</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>San.</speaker>
               <p>It was an affront to both, therefore the best way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge it, is for one to set upon him before, whilest the other at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taques him hehind.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Elv.</speaker>
               <p>In my judgement you are both too nice to interpret an affront from a gentlemans ill treatment of a Servant, when the Master is not in presence. A Servants sawciness oftentimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves it.</p>

               <p>I do not make a positive conclusion that I am oblig'd to resent it, but only supposing it an affront, that it concerns not <hi>Don Gusman,</hi> but me to revenge it.</p>

               <p>Sir, the occasion of this visit, is to let you understand, that one action of yours this morning has procur'd you two enemies; both which have a design at your life, and either of them is brave enough to make you stand in need of all your va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dieg.</speaker>
               <p>I ghess the Enemies you mean are <hi>Don Ruis</hi> and <hi>Don Gusman.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Elv.</speaker>
               <p>The same Sir, tho the fate of arms shou'd give you ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage over one, yet you are not in safety, whilst the other has his blood to spill; and the second may do what the first faild in.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dieg.</speaker>
               <p>I neither doubt their courage nor my own. The most brave is not sure of success.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Elv.</speaker>
               <p>To avoid the mischief, absent your self two or three dayes out of Town. In which time I will so qualifie things,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48498:29"/>
that there shall be no prejudice to your honour.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dieg.</speaker>
               <p>Quit the Town Madam for a quarrel! No.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Elv.</speaker>
               <p>If the Love you have for the fair <hi>Octavia</hi> makes you find any difficulty in absence, let your servants onely give out you are gone some little journey: But especially let me beg the favour of you not to be seen to day.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dieg.</speaker>
               <p>I wish, with a blind obedience, I could acknowledge the honour you do me in the care you take of my safety. But far from avoiding my enemies, honour obliges me to prevent their inquiry by my presence.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Elv.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, had you a single enemy, but you have two?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dieg.</speaker>
               <p>If Madam, for me you have this fear, I advise you to quit it. For the danger is not so great as you imagine, tho the odds be so. My enemies being valiant, they will without doubt be as generous.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Elv.</speaker>
               <p>If your honour obliges you to accept the combat, the interest of your Mistress forbids it. Do you think she can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of divulging so nice a secret, and if you love her as she deserves, wou'd it not be better to make a sacrifice of your fame to her, than to have the displeasure of exposing hers?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dieg.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> should be much troubled, if it should cost me my own reputation to be sparing of anothers, whose interest I am no longer oblidg'd to. But if in obeying you, I shou'd be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd to do you a service; so pleasant a consideration, might make me forget what <hi>I</hi> owe my self.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Elv.</speaker>
               <p>Since neither the care of your self, nor the considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a person for whom you are oblig'd to have the greatest esteem in the world will induce you to comply. Know too, you will render me the greatest service imaginable. For as a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret I tell it you, that one of your two enemies is my Lover, the event of this quarrel must either way be unfortunate. If you conquer, death deprives me of him, if he vanquish you, <hi>I</hi> lose him in his flight.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dieg.</speaker>
               <p>This is the real cause you require my absence?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Elv.</speaker>
               <p>It is. Trust me with your honour a few dayes, and I will render it back bright as it is, with a full assurance of your safety.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dieg.</speaker>
               <p>Your Love shall ever be a secret, but as to the rest, it
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48498:29"/>
is impossible to give you an absolute satisfaction. All that <hi>I</hi> can do to serve you, is to constrain my resentment to <hi>Don Gus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> for he (doubtless) is the gallant person, that has the honour to please you. <hi>I</hi> must not flie his presence, but at all times that he shall speak to me as a gallant person ought to do, he shall find, that <hi>I</hi> know in what manner to answer him.</p>

               <p>Answer me, Sir, I pray, to find a Lady in your Chamber, to force by a Sentinel, set to forbid entrance, to see you all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd at the surprise I gave you by pressing in; to hear your new Mistress talk of a divorce betwixt you and me, which was a secret, she cou'd not know, but from you alone; and lastly, to see you rather play the ridiculous person, then let slip any occasion to offend me, and to conduct a stranger down Stairs in the presence of one you knew, whom you left with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the least civility of excuse.- answer me you that are so skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in visions, if this be one, shall I be made believe that you know not this person, never saw her face, shall this pass for truth, or shall it all be vision, vision.</p>

               <p>I have already told you, that the Lady you ground your anger on is an absolute stranger, that I have no manner of knowledge either of her name or person, I neither ask'd to see one, or hear the other.</p>

               <p>I have told you as much of <hi>Don Gusman,</hi> that I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had seen him, spoken to him, or receiv'd Letters from him, and yet you wou'd not believe me, tho you never found him in my Chamber.

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> befits not a man of good sense so grosly to impose on a person that hath either eyes or ears. And you'd have done better to have said, that you cou'd not hinder a Lady so accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish'd and beautiful, to have an inclination for you, that 'twou'd not have been like a gallant soul, to deny her entrance into your
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48498:31"/>
house, when she came on purpose, to honour you with her visits. But that you receive them out of complaisance; that in your passion some words slipt from you of our falling out. But not to be willing to own any thing is to acknowledg your self guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all, and your obstinate denyal of your crime is a proof that you are not sorry for't. Adieu my Dear Lover, that has found a new Mistress full as fair, but questionless not half so false as the old, peaceably enjoy your new conquest and let there be no more Sentinels at your door, if I am the only person you are afraid off.</p>

               <p>Oh Heavens! his coming hither is of dangerous conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. He is the man of whom <hi>Don Diego</hi> is become jealous, and if he should know, that <hi>I</hi> have seen him here, he wou'd have reason to believe, that <hi>I</hi> have indeed betraid him.</p>

               <p>To take away your fear, you shall understand how <hi>I</hi> contriv'd it. <hi>I</hi> order'd <hi>Iacinta</hi> to conduct him to the back door of your house, without giving him any account to whom it belong'd, tho he should make inquiry. Now let some one go down, and open the back door, and bring him up the private stair case, into your apartment, <hi>I</hi> alone will appear to receive him; thus it will be so far from coming to the knowledge of <hi>Don Diego,</hi> that <hi>Don Gusman</hi> himself will never know that he has been here in your House.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Don Diego,</hi> and my self, being gotten into the field, we had already our swords in our hands, and just ready to engage, when <hi>Don Ruis,</hi> who persu'd us with all speed, interpos'd and declar'd to <hi>Don Diego</hi> that I was not his enemy, but that he was the only man offended, and was able without my assistance to take his revenge. <hi>Don Diego</hi> might perhaps have hearken'd to what he said; but I urg'd that he cou'd not quit me for another, without confessing himself conquer'd. He cou'd not digest so harsh a word, yet the obstinate <hi>Don Ruis</hi> to prevent our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, put himself again betwixt us.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Gus.</speaker>
               <p>Whilst we were thus contending, some friends, who had likewise heard of our design, I know not how, came to us, and woud know the ground of our quarrel.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oct.</speaker>

               <p>
                  <hi>Don Diego,</hi> forc'd by their importunity to tell the cause of his resentment, declar'd he was jealous of me, charging me of attempts to deprive him of the affections of a Lady, for whom he had an ardour that was inextinguishable, then mention'd a Serenade last night, and a Letter that this morning he surpriz'd
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48498:34"/>
in the hands of my servant. But <hi>Don Ruis</hi> clear'd me of these accusations owning himself the person that gave this Cerenade, and that sent the Letter too, but not to the Lady, but her ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant. <hi>Don Diego</hi> perceiving his errors, embrac'd me in the most obliging manner, and made excuses, which I receiv'd with a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere affection.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Gus.</speaker>
               <p>Now to adjust matters betwixt him and <hi>Don Ruis,</hi> their friends affirmed, that the extroardinary beauty of a Lady might justifie both their pretensions to adore her. That two such Gallant persons, coveting the same object, declar'd it to be of a more then common value. And that a Lover without Rivals might conclude he had a Mistress without merit.</p>

               <p>By these discreet Mediators they were oblig'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure the fair person that charm'd them both to decide their right by her choice.

               <p>I do Sir, with all my heart. But now you must be gone. My father has forbidden you the house, and charg'd me never to receive you more. He will presently come in if he finds you here, neither you nor I must hope his pardon.</p>

               <p>Whilst <hi>I</hi> was watching below to be blest with a sight of you from your Windows, he came forth in company of a person, whom 'tis probable he will not so soon leave. If with as much sincerity as speed, you granted my pardon, you will have time more than necessary to give me farther assurances of it, and I too shall have enough to return you thanks for your favours.</p>

               <p>Stay Sir, and let me tell you in short, That I was no sooner return'd from the field, but I was inform'd by the Servant of <hi>Elvira,</hi> that her Mistress was gone to a Friends House, and had given her order to bring me to her with all speed, where she had an opportunity to discourse with me, which the presence of <hi>Don Ruis</hi> allow'd her not at home. I went: was conducted in a back way at a private door: was had up into a fair apartment, where I was received only by the fair <hi>Elvira,</hi> her first words demanded if I were resolv'd to fight with you. I replied we had already been in the field, and that you was no longer my enemy or her Brothers. Those doubtful words deceiv'd the understanding of one that hearken'd, for then a Lady bolted out of an inner Room, eagerly demanding if you was kill'd! Her passionate en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries forc'd from me a speedy relation of what had pass'd in the field, which scarce was ended when news was brought that her Father was come in; that he had lock'd the back door, which was left open for my retreat; to avoid his presence, I retired in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an inner Room, but he no sooner enter'd, but <hi>Elvira</hi> took her leave to be gone, he offer'd her his service home, which she ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted to give me an opportunity to get out of the house. They were no sooner gone, but your coming up occasioned a second surprise. I again made my retreat to the same place. What fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd I need not tell you. Now <hi>Don Diego</hi> do you think, you and <hi>I</hi> have any occasion to go into the Field.</p>

                  <hi>I</hi> retreated, onely defending my self till I reach'd the stairs, and then I was too nimble for the old assaylant.

               <p>Ods precious e'ne let him have her too. As they have been Rogues together, e'ne let 'em fare both alike, and now

go to be married together. Ods precious, it is the best way, so a done.</p>

               <p>I feel the torments of successless love, and cannot be so cruel to see my friend in that condition. 'Tis my only happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness at this time, that I can so well dispose of her. I have a mind at present so disturb'd at my own loss, that I have no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct o're my self, how unfit am <hi>I</hi> then to have the charge of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Here Sir, <hi>I</hi> resign her to you.</p>

               <p>Ods precious Cheary, cheary, <hi>Don Ruis,</hi> Love in the breast is like a bush of dry Thorns in an oven; it blazes, and crackles, and keeps a sputter for a while, but presently gives over. Ods precious think no more of her.</p>

            <l>Our Londoners are gone for recreation</l>
            <l>To spend with Country friends the long vacation;</l>

            <l>The Country gallants too, whom suits of Law,</l>
            <l>And Four Cart-horses up to Town did draw</l>
            <l>In mouldy Couch, fill'd with their she relations,</l>
            <l>Who once a year come up to see the fashions;</l>
            <l>When each had bought her a new tawdry Gown,</l>
            <l>The Law Suits ended and the terms were done.</l>
            <l>They and their Sun burnt Squires hasten'd down.</l>

            <l>What difference, me thoughts there was,</l>
            <l>Betwixt a Country Gallant and a Wit.</l>
            <l>When you did order Perriwig with Comb,</l>
            <l>They only us'd four fingers and a Thumb.</l>
            <l>Whil'st you stroak'd up fring'd gloves were elbow deep,</l>
            <l>They one glove on, the other off did keep,</l>
            <l>Thus twist and twist, and the tand calve-skin gripe,</l>
            <l>Till it look'd like a Chitterlin or Tripe;</l>
            <l>And then to stretch it, thus thro' hand they'd pull it.</l>
            <l>But Lord! the wisp'd Cravat that hung below the gullet!</l>
            <l>How pale and white did your complexions shew</l>
            <l>To their Mary-Gold-Faces, as they sat by you!</l>
            <l>But when betwixt the acts they did stand up,</l>
            <l>Their swords look'd as if they belong to th'County troop<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </l>
            <l>Huge ones they wore in narrow girdle Belts.</l>
            <l>But most I laugh'd to see their flapping Felts.</l>
            <l>They in their greasie waste Belts and great Swords,</l>
            <l>Like Yeomen look'd, but, you like any Lords.</l>
            <l>You had large shoulder Belts with Riband ty'd,</l>
            <l>And each a little little spit-frog by his side.</l>
