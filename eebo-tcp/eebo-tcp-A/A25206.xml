            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

THe imposed use of <hi>Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferencics</hi> has been (like the <hi>Canaanites</hi> to the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites) pricks</hi> in the eyes, and <hi>thorns</hi> (or goads) in the sides of, <hi>i. e.</hi> matter of much mischief and vexation to, the Church of God almost in all ages; Especially, in the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church, when it drew towards the dregs, much of this sediment appeared. How far the <hi>Papal, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian</hi> Church is over-run with this ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, is notorious: And it's one great evil which our <hi>English</hi> Church now labours and groans under at this day. 'Tis this, which has been the apple of contention, and bone of division; the stone of stumbling, and rock of offence among us, ever since the beginning of the Reformation, in the time of our <hi>Josiah,</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:96975:4"/>
King <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>6th.</hi> And after many years freedom from this itch, it brake out again some years since, to our great disturbance, and scratching of one another.</p>
            <p>Now for the better fixing our judgements concerning either our Liberty or Restraint in such cases, I shall euter upon a strict exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, and narrow consideration of this portion of Scripture, which furnishes us with one of the most pregnant, and pertinent instances, or Historical passages to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, in the whole New Testament; which I shall examine from top to toe, that thereby we may discover how far forth it will help us, either one way or other, <hi>i. e.</hi> either for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, or Non-conformity, in such like cases.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. The whole passage contains a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course between Christ, and the Scribes and Pharisees, concerning the observation of the Traditions of the Elders, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>casion'd by the Disciples neglect thereof; for which the Scribes and Pharisees implead them to their Master, and quarrel him about it: In which he vindicates 'em at large, and blows up the very foundation of their complaint, by showing the invalidity, yea impiety, of these Traditions. This is the general pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the whole. In handling of which, I shall first distinctly consider the several par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars; and then make such Reflections up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96975:4"/>
'em, and draw such Inferences from 'em, as they naturally afford, and may be conduci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to my present design.</p>
            <p>The Particulars contain'd in the foregoing General, take as follows. Here are (1) the <hi>Accusers.</hi> (2) The <hi>Accused.</hi> (3) The <hi>Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation.</hi> (4) The Defence.</p>

               <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. First, The <hi>Accusers; Scribes and Pharisees which were of Jerusalem;</hi> or, <hi>which came from Jerusalcm.</hi> These may be considered both in reference to their <hi>Condition, Scribes and Pharisees;</hi> and in reference to their <hi>Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> or the place from whence they came, <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1) <hi>Scribes;</hi> this is a Title of Function or Imployment; they might be either <hi>Priests</hi> or <hi>Levites,</hi> for we find Scribes of both sorts; <hi>Priests,</hi> as <hi>Neb.</hi> 8. 9. <hi>Ezra the Priest the Scribe.</hi> So <hi>Ezra</hi> 7. 11. <hi>Levites,</hi> as 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34. 13. <hi>Of the Levites there were Scribes,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Chron. 24. 6. <hi>Shemajah, the son of Nethaneel the Scribe, one of the Levites.</hi> But which soever they were, they were, as to their Office and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, <hi>Teachers</hi> and <hi>Expounders</hi> of the Law in their Schools and Synagogues; as <hi>Ezra</hi> 7. 6.<hi>—a ready Scribe in the Law of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</hi> v. 10. <hi>He had prepared his heart to teach in Israel statutes and judgements.</hi> Neh. 8. 1—9, 13.

            <p>But I shall insist no further upon this, but hasten to that which I chiefly aim at, which is, the two following Points,

               <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Accusation</hi> it self, and the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. The Accusation it self, or the Practice, or Usage concerning which the Contest and Dispute arose, which is,</p>
            <p>In <hi>General, a Transgression of the Tradition of the Elders,</hi> or <hi>Disobedience to the Injunctions of Authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Particularly, Eating with unwashen hands.</hi> The former relates to the Authority enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; The latter is the Practice enjoyned.</p>
            <p>As to the former, the General, I shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider (1) Who these <hi>Elders</hi> were. (2) What was a <hi>Tradition</hi> of the Elders.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 8. First, Who these <hi>Elders</hi> were. The word <hi>[Elders]</hi> in its primary and origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal sense, relates to <hi>Age,</hi> and denotes, either such as lived <hi>a great while;</hi> even till they came to be old; or, such as lived <hi>a great while ago;</hi> those of former times; as <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 7. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 2. and so 'tis the same with <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 21. and thence it's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to signifie most commonly, both Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Authority; and so we find both in <hi>Hebrew, Greek, Latin,</hi> and <hi>English</hi> (to name no more) the words importing <hi>Age</hi> or <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dership,</hi> viz. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Senatus, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen,</hi> do denote both <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Power.</hi> And</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:96975:7"/>
(1) This sense is very frequent both in the Old and New Testament. I shall mention but a few places of the chief; as <hi>Deut.</hi> 22. 15.——<hi>the Elders of City in the gate</hi> (the place of Judicature). And they are sometimes called, <hi>Elders of the people,</hi> i. e. such who had authority over the people; as <hi>Elders of a City,</hi> are they that are in power in that City. Thus <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 3. <hi>Then assembled together the chief Priests, and Scribes, and Elders of the people.</hi> So <hi>c.</hi> 27. 1. <hi>When the morning was come, all the chief Priests, and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the people took counsel,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Hence they are commonly joyned with <hi>[Rulers];</hi> as 2 <hi>King.</hi> 10. 1. <hi>Jehu wrote let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters——to the Rulers of Jezreel, and to the Elders.</hi> Act. 4. 8. <hi>Ye Rulers and Elders of Israel;</hi> and they are very frequently joyn'd with <hi>[chief Priests, and Scribes and Pharisees;]</hi> and then the distinction that was between them, I conceive may be stated thus; As they were distinguisht from the <hi>Pricsts,</hi> they seem to be Lay-men (as we call 'em), and as distinguisht from <hi>Scribes,</hi> they were such as were not brought up wholly in the study of the Law, or at least did not make that their Profession; but were some of the Nobility and Gentry, admitted to be Members of the <hi>Sanhedrim, as</hi> is most evident from these places following, <hi>Acts</hi> 22. 5. <hi>The High Priest doth bear me wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, with all the estate of the Elders; from whom also I received letters unto the brethren,</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:96975:8"/>
               <hi>and went to Damascus, to bring them which were there, bound unto Jerusalem, for to be punisht:</hi> and <hi>c.</hi> 24. 1. <hi>Ananias the High Priest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended with the Elders, who informed the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour against Paul.</hi> Matth. 26. 59. <hi>Now the chief Priests and Elders, and all the Council, sought false witness against Jesus,</hi> &amp;c. Mark 15. 1. <hi>The chief Priests held a consultation with the Elders and Scribes, and the Whole Council.</hi> So that nothing is more clear, than that they were Members of the Council, and persons in, and of, Authority.</p>
            <p>I have been the more full in this point, because <hi>Grotius in loc.</hi> thinks that these El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders here mentioned, though they were learned and wise men, and so possibly might be Members of the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; yet that the mention made of 'em here, does not relate to any such capacity they were in; but only, as celebrated Teachers, who were not only famous in their Generations, but were had in great veneration and esteem in after-times, and their judgements and dogmes were of great authority. And so <hi>Beza</hi> takes 'em too, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the ancient Doctors, and not for persons in authority. But even <hi>Grotius</hi> himself elsewhere <hi>(viz.</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 5.) gives this account of 'em, <hi>Seniores, idem quod Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natores, &amp; consules vrbium. Elders are the same with the Senate, or Court of Aldermen, or,</hi> at least, <hi>Common-council-men, and 'Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesses</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:96975:8"/>
               <hi>of Cities:</hi> And the places foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned do most evidently and undeniably evince, that they were persons in authority, and members of the <hi>Sankedrim</hi> (as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) or great Council of the Nation: And therefore</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect. 9.</hi> (2) They were the proper Judges of Ecclesiastical affairs, to whose cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance matters of Religion did appertain. <hi>Hi doctrina &amp; religionis to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            </p>
            <p>And particularly, It was the peculiar priviledge of those Doctors who were Members of the great Council to frame such Decrees, Constitutions or Traditions. This I gather from that passage of the <hi>Targum</hi> on <hi>Eccles.</hi> 12. 12. where it is said, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p n="3">(3) We may easily imagine the reason why the Scribes and Pharisees here, were so much conçern'd at this neglect of the Disciples, <hi>viz.</hi> because their own Copy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold was toucht, and their own authority lay at stake, inasmuch as they were the Successors of these Elders; so that the slight that was put upon the one, redounded to the disparagement of the other. <hi>Non mirum Scribas violatione traditionum seniorum cito of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensos fuisse, quod co &amp; ipsorum authoritas elevari videretur, qui jam Seniorum locum tenerent, illorum successores, &amp; institutorum propagatorcs,</hi> saith <hi>Brugensis.</hi> Hence Christ calls 'em <hi>your Traditions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So then, The <hi>Elders</hi> here meant were such as lived in former times, who were persons of great Dignity and Authority, to whose cognisance matters of Religion did apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and to whom it belonged to belonged to form and frame these Constitutions or Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

Where, by the way, you may take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice (and that you may take the more and better notice of it, know, That it is the Observation of the prodigiously learned Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet)</hi> That the word <hi>[Elder]</hi> or <hi>Presbyter,</hi> according to the common use of it, has a higher Character, and is of more excellent import, than the word <hi>[Bishop];</hi> the former noting Dignity and Authority, (as has been show'd); the latter, only mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Duty, Charge, Trouble and Business.

            <p n="2">2: The next thing to be spoken unto, is to show, What the Traditions of these El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were: And here I shall consider (1) their <hi>Nature.</hi> (2) <hi>Original.</hi> (3) <hi>Validity,</hi> or, what stress they laid upon'em.</p>

            </p>

               <hi>Sect.</hi> 11. Secondly, What was the ground they went upon, or the occasion of their first broaching these Traditions? In general, it was, as they express it, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> To make a hedg to the Law, that men should not break in upon it to transgress it: and this was a specious colour for all their Traditions; for they pretending to make Constitutions to fence the Law from viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to raise the observance of it the higher, they multiplied inventions and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of their own brains, and set 'em up for Laws, and so made the Law indeed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth. I shall give you an instance but in one of 'em. The written Law for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad, <hi>Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his Mothers milk,</hi> Exod. 23. 19. Now to make sure, as they pretended, that this Law should not be violated, they fenced it with this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <hi>Thou shalt not seethe any flesh whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in any milk whatsoever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we see, how very apt men are to set their posts by God's Pillars, to light up their Candles to his Sun, to put their varnish upon his Gold, and, like Botchers, to patch their inventions upon his Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The <hi>Jewish Rabbies,</hi> under a speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pretence of Piety, brought in whole loads of this kind of trash, which they called
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:96975:11"/>
               <hi>Sepimenta legis,</hi> but were indeed but <hi>impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimenta,</hi> because God's Commands were thereby frustrated, as our Saviour Christ shows here, in the sequel of this discourse. This is the general reason: But</p>
            <p>As for the particular grounds of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Traditions, I shall have occasion to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion some afterwards.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 12. Thirdly, What was their Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity? Of what account they were among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and what value they put upon 'em, appears by many passages in their Authors. It is a saying of the <hi>Talmudists,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Verba Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balae aequiparantur verbis Legis.</hi> Here they set them cheek by jole (as we say) with the Commands of God: but this is not all; they set 'em even above the Law of God it self, and make that to lacquey behind: for this is another saying in the <hi>Talmud</hi> (as <hi>Grotius</hi> quotes it) <hi>Plus est in verbis Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barum quam in verbis Legis; There's more weight in the words of the Scribes, than in the words of the Law.</hi> And Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> quotes another to the same purpose, <hi>The words of the Elders are more lovely than the words of the Law, and more weighty than the words of the Prophets.</hi> Hence they say of this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in particular, That <hi>be that eats his bread with unwashen hands, sins as grievously as if he lay with a Whore.</hi> So saith <hi>R. Fose</hi> in
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:96975:12"/>
               <hi>Talm. Sota. c. 1.</hi> yea, saith <hi>R. Akiba, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves to dye for it;</hi> and accordingly, water being once brought to him both for drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and washing, and the greatest part of it being casually spilt, the remainder he used for washing, saying, <hi>That it's better to dye, than to transgress the tradition of the Elders.</hi> And this is a saying too, among them, Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever dwells in the land of <hi>Israel,</hi> and eats his ordinary food after a cleanly manner, and speaks in the holy language, and saith over his Phylacteries morning and evening, may be confident that he shall obtain happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the world to come.</p>
            <p>But lest any should take these Traditions for matters of Counsel only, or bare opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which laid no manner of obligation upon them, and because a passage of <hi>Grotius,</hi> formerly quoted and animadverted upon, may seem to look that way (though what has been said already under this last head, does abundantly prove what an high opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion they had of them in point of their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligatoriness) Yet further, as I show'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the word <hi>[Elder]</hi> denotes persons of a publick Character, and such as were in places of power and authority, and not only persons in a private capacity; so I shall further prove, by several Arguments, that the Traditions of these Elders were not points of opinion only, but matters of injunction and command.</p>

            <p n="3">(3) The word <hi>[transgress] (Why do thy Disciples transgress the tradition of the Elders?)</hi> implies, that they held them obligatory; and that these Traditions laid an obligation upon them; for, why else do they tax the Disciples for the transgression thereof, if they did not take'em to have the nature of a law?

            <p n="5">(5) These <hi>Elders,</hi> who were the Authors of these Traditions, were members of the Senate, and Rulers (as was proved afore), and consequently, a Tradition, or Decision of their's, had the nature of a law, and was of a binding power, being the act of the whole body; as we find it was in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular case: for the whole body of the Council espoused the quarrel of this Rite; for they Excommunicated <hi>R.

            <p>Several other Rules and Directions are given, both as to the <hi>Quality</hi> and <hi>Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity</hi> of the water; as also concerning the <hi>Vessel</hi> that the water is to be put into, which may be seen in the forementioned Author, <hi>sect.</hi> 24—28.</p>

(5) They were to lift up their hands (whence it was called <hi>Netilas Jadajim,</hi> as was said) that the water might not run back from the hands to the fingers, and so defile them again: for they held, that the water that was poured upon the hands did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract moral defilement thereby, as was said.</p>
            <p n="6">(6) They were to pull off Rings, Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, or any such thing that was upon the hands, and to rub 'em well, and then dry 'em thoroughly.</p>

            <p n="8">(8) It was so far from that, that they pretended a particular ground from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for it, <hi>viz.</hi> that command, <hi>Levit.</hi> 15. 11. <hi>Whomsoever he touches that hath the issue, and hath not rinsed his hands in water, he shall wash</hi>

these cleanly persons prescribed such a ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonious, methodical, artificial kind of washing. But I take the former account out of their own Authors, to be the most authentick, and pertinent.</p>
            <p>Whereby we may perceive that this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of theirs has the advantage of our Ceremonies, for there is no particular pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept alledged for the establishment or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancing any of them; yea, there's little or nothing of Reason can be said for 'em.

Nay (Eastly) it might seem to be a point of Civility, and a piece of cleanliness, which no doubt but both Christ and the Disciples might use upon occasion, though only as a matter of civility, wherein Religion was not concern'd either one way or other, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were done or not.</p>
            <p>And this too is more than can be said on the behalf of our Ceremonies; for there is no such, either Decency, or Conveniency in the use of them.</p>

            <p n="1">(1) That in those words, <hi>v.</hi> 3. he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines the very foundation upon which all this tottering building of Traditions stood; For it was a prin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Either He does here by this one instance argue against, and condemn all Traditions in general, as well as this one, or he does not.

               </gap>nd: For the Pharisees might reply, Well! suppose you can pick out one Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which you say does plainly derogate from a Command of God, yet what's that to the case before us? This that we implead your Disciples for, is none of those, but founded upon a particular law; and therefore that stands firm and ought to be observed, as not liable to this exception; and so, they are guilty for not observing it. But now that Christ should argue thus loosely and incoherently is by no means to be admitted. Shall He who gave to man the faculty of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:96975:17"/>
Reason, be defective in any point of Reason himself? As the Psalmist argues concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God's Knowledge and Providence, <hi>Psal.</hi> 94. 9, 10. <hi>He that planted the ear, shall not he hear? He that formed the eye, shall be not see?—He that teaches man knowledge, shall not he know?</hi> So may we say in this case. True, the Reason of Christ's discourses sometimes lies very deep, that it's hard for us to fathom it with our short understandings, and to attain to a clear apprehension of it: but however, we cannot without blasphemy admit of any flaw in it, or deny it to be firm, valid and concluding.</p>
            <p>But then, if He did here argue against all such Traditions in general, my Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation stands good, and I have gained my Point. And hence it will follow,</p>
            <p n="3">(3) That to observe such Traditions, and Institutions, is so far from being a Duty, that it is a sin; because thereby the Law of God is transgressed.</p>

that prophecie of <hi>Isaiah, This people draws nigh,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> they pretend a great deal of Religion in their outward carriage, and seem to be very diligent in all external du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but all is but from the teeth outward: their Religion is but a meer carkass, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any life, or soul, or spirit in it; the heart is wanting.

any thing in the worship of God, not only contrary to, but besides, the Word, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in these words by Christ; and they that take their measures in Worship, from the Commandments of men, their worship is vain, bootless, and unprofitable, yea mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous and abominable: And such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons Christ pronounces to be Hypocrites; and such we must take 'em for, except we will contradict his judgement. Your zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous assertors of, and great sticklers for, the observation of humane inventions in God's worship, are great hypocrites in Christ's account; and they that urge and impose such things as strictly, or more strictly than the observation of divine Institutions, are guilty of gross hypocrisie, whatever they pretend, as to Decency, Uniformity, Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or the like. For, though a practice be really a matter of Decency and Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, and thereupon some Rules and Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions may be given by Authority about it; yet it ought not to be enjoyn'd as strictly, or as much stress laid upon it, as upon the substantials and vitals of Worship: as for example. In point of <hi>Time,</hi> or <hi>Place,</hi> or <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,</hi> or <hi>Habit,</hi> 'tis to be supposed, and I think we may well take it for granted, that generally, n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
