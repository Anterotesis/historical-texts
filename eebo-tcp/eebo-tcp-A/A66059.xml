            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <bibl>ECCLES. 12. 13.</bibl>
               <q>Let us hear the conclusion of the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
Fear God, and keep his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
for <hi>this is the Whole of man.</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THis Book is one of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophical
Discourses,</hi> containing
such principal Observations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<hi>Human Affairs,</hi> as are apt to offer
themselves to the thoughts of every seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
considerate man, especially concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95602:3"/>
those things which may more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
either promote or hinder our
<hi>Happiness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Text is the <hi>Conclusion</hi> which he
inferrs upon the whole matter, that
which is the most natural result of all
such Debates and Enquiries:</p>
            <p>In the former part he had taken into
consideration those several <hi>states of life,</hi>
to which men usually apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
for <hi>Happiness;</hi> namely, <hi>Learning</hi>
and <hi>Wisdom, Mirth</hi> and <hi>Pleasures, Power</hi>
and <hi>Greatness, Riches</hi> and <hi>Possessions:</hi>
Each of which he doth by great varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Arguments prove to be vanity
and vexation, and altogether insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to the End for which they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed.</p>
            <p>Then he takes notice of the several
<hi>Accidents of life,</hi> whether they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
our <hi>Endeavours,</hi> or our <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:95602:3"/>
1. For our <hi>Endeavours.</hi> The most
likely Means are not always effectual
for the attaining of their End. The
utmost that Human Councils and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
can provide for, is to take care,
when they are to contend in a Race,
that they be swifter than those who
run against them; or when they are to
fight a Battel, that they be stronger
than those whom they are to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.<note place="margin">Chap. 9. 11, 12.</note>
And yet <hi>the race is not always to
the swift, nor the Battel to the strong,
neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
to men of understanding, nor favour
to men of skill; but time and chance hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
to them all.</hi> (i.e.) There is a secret Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
which doth over-rule all those
worldly events in such a manner, as is not
accountable to Human Reason. Even
amongst <hi>Secular Businesses,</hi> which we are
apt to think most within our reach and
compass, there is nothing so much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95602:4"/>
the power of the wisest Counsels
and Endeavours, but that the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God may interpose for the
disappointing of it, and render it ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual.</p>
            <p>And then for those <hi>Accidents</hi> to which
our <hi>Persons</hi> are liable, He observes
these three things:</p>
            <p>1. Our obnoxiousness of <hi>Pain</hi> and
<hi>Sickness,</hi> which he stiles by the names of
<hi>Wrath</hi> and <hi>Sorrow;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ch. 5. 17</note> under which, when
a man lyes languishing, none of his
Worldly Enjoyments will signifie any
thing to him; nor will they be able to
afford him any such ease or help, but
that he may be thereby <hi>cut off in the
midst of his days, and then all his thoughts
perish,</hi> or else waste away a great part of
his life with much anguish and weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
and may sometimes, perhaps, be
driven to that extremity by noisome
and painful Diseases, as to chuse
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95602:4"/>
strangling and death, rather than life.</p>
            <p>2. If it be supposed, that by the
strength and cheerfulness of a mans natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
temper, he should escape these, and
<hi>live many years,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ch. 11. 8</note> 
               <hi>and rejoyce in them all;</hi> yet
<hi>he must remember the days of darkness,
which shall be many.</hi> (i.e.) Those who
devote themselves to continual Mirth
and Pleasure, cannot yet avoid the
thought of their <hi>future estates,</hi> what
shall become of them hereafter, when
they are to depart out of this World;
but that the remembrance of this will
be often thrusting into their Minds
when ever they are retired and seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
And this being to them a dark
obscure condition, concerning their
well-being in which, they can have no
reasonable hopes, must needs therefore
be a great damp and allay to all their
other Enjoyments.</p>
            <p>3. But in the third place: Suppose
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95602:5"/>
a man should be able to avoid <hi>sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
and to put the trouble of <hi>these
thoughts</hi> likewise far from him; yet
there is somewhat else which he cannot
possibly decline, <hi>Old Age</hi> will unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably
steal upon him, with all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities
of it;<note place="margin">C. 12. 3.</note> 
               <hi>when the grinders shall
be few, and appetite cease; when those
who look out of the windows, shall be
darkned, and the keepers of the house
shall tremble:</hi> when a man shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a burden to himself, and to his
Friends; when those of his nearest rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
whom he hath most obliged by
kindness, shall think it time for him
to depart unto his <hi>long home,</hi>
               <note place="margin">C. 12. 5.</note> to creep
off the Stage, and make room for suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
Generations; and then, after a
little Funeral-pomp of the <hi>Mourners
going about the streets,</hi> a man shall be
buried out of the way, and forgotten:
<hi>For there is no remembrance of the wise,</hi>
               <note place="margin">C. 2. 16.</note>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:95602:5"/>
               <hi>more than of the fool; seeing that which
now is, in the days to come shall be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</hi>
Every Generation producing some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
which seems new and strange, to
take up men's talk and wonder, and
to drown the memory of former Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and Actions. And I appeal to
any rational man, Whether these are
not some of the most material refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
that occurr about Human Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.</p>
            <p>Now from all these premises put
together, he inferrs this Conclusion in
the Text, That <hi>to fear God, and keep
his Commandments, is the Whole of man.</hi>
(i.e.) To be serious in the matter of
Religion, and careful about our fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
states, is that which every consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
man, after all his other disquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and experiments, will find to be
his greatest interest, that which doth
most of all deserve his care and study.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:95602:6"/>
There are these Two parts in the
words:</p>
            <p>1. A <hi>Description of Religion,</hi> which
in the former Clause is said to consist
in <hi>fearing God,</hi> and <hi>keeping his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
An awful apprehension of the
Divine Nature, and an obedient sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to His Will.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>A</hi> Commendation of Religion, <hi>in
the latter Clause,</hi> This is the Whole of
man.</p>
            <p>It is the second of these only, which
I purpose to treat of at this time.</p>
            <p>In the handling of which, the first
thing to be enquired into, is, What
is the true import and meaning of this
phrase in the Original: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> for
the right understanding of which, it
will be proper to consider the several
ways of expressing it in other Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Septuagint <hi>and the</hi> Vulgar <hi>do
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95602:6"/>
render it</hi> verbatim, This is All, <hi>or</hi>
Every man. <hi>The word</hi> Duty, <hi>which is
supplied by our English, being not in
the</hi> Original, <hi>or in other</hi> Translations.
This ought to be the way and course of all
mankind, <hi>so the</hi> Targum. This is the
course to which every man is designed, <hi>so
the</hi> Syriack. This will be most profitable
and advantagious to men, <hi>so the</hi> Arabick.
Hoc est totum hominis, <hi>This is</hi> the whole
of man; <hi>so some of our later Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters,
most proper to the scope of
the place, it being an usual</hi> Enallage <hi>in
the</hi> Hebrew, Totius universalis, pro toto
integrante, <hi>All for Whole.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that according to these various
Interpretations of the words, they may
contain in them a three-fold reference:
To the <hi>Essence,</hi> the <hi>Happiness,</hi> the <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness</hi>
of man.</p>
            <p>According to which, the sense of them
must be, That Religion, or the <hi>fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95602:7"/>
of God,</hi> and <hi>keeping his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
is a matter of so great conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
to Human Nature, that</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>Essence</hi> or Being of man,
may be said to consist in it.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Happiness</hi> or well-being of
man, doth depend upon it.</p>
            <p>3. The great <hi>Business</hi> or Duty of
man, is to be conversant about it, and
to labour after it.</p>
            <p>These particulars I shall endeavour
to make out by such clear Principles of
Reason, attested to by several of the
wisest Heathen Writers, as may be
enough to satisfie any serious man who
is able to understand the reason and
consequence of things, and will but
attend and consider.</p>
            <p>1. I begin with the first: Religion
is of so great importance, that the <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi>
of man may be said to consist in
it. Mankind may be considered under
a two-fold notion:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:95602:7"/>
1. More <hi>Separately,</hi> and by it self,
according to that Principle whereby
'tis constituted in such a rank of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>2. More <hi>Complexly,</hi> as joyned in
Society, for which Man seems to be
naturally designed, and without which
he could not well subsist. Now Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
will appear to be Essential to him
in both these respects.</p>
            <p>1. As considered <hi>Separately,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to those Principles by which he is
framed. That which doth constitute
any thing in its Being, and distinguish it
from all other things, This is that which
we call the <hi>Form</hi> or <hi>Essence</hi> of a thing.
And this, for the Human Nature, doth
consist in those very things which are
the chief Principles and Foundations
of Religion; namely, the <hi>Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of a Deity,</hi> and an <hi>Expectation of
a future state</hi> after this life: Which no
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95602:8"/>
other Creature, below Man, doth par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of; and which are common to
all Mankind, notwithstanding the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
endeavours that can be used for
the suppressing of them.</p>
            <p>As for what is commonly alledged
in the behalf of <hi>Reason,</hi> it may be
observed, that in the Actions of many
Bruit Creatures, there are discernable
some kind of foot-steps, some imperfect
strictures and degrees of Ratiocination;
such a natural Sagacity as bears a near
resemblance to Reason. From whence
it may follow, that it is not Reason
in the <hi>general,</hi> which is the Form of
Human Nature; But Reason as it is
<hi>determined</hi> to Actions of Religion, of
which we do not find the least signs or
degrees in Bruits. Man being the only
Creature in this visible World, that is
formed with a Capacity of worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
and enjoying his Maker. Nor is
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95602:8"/>
this any new Opinion, but such as se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
of the Ancient Writers, <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers,
Orators, Poets,</hi> have attested
to, who make this Notion of a Deity,
and Adoration of Him, to be the
true difference betwixt Man and
Beast.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plutarch</hi> asserts it to be a very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper
thing to own such for Men,
who do not acknowledg and adore the
Deity. And in another place, he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
Irreligion to be a kind of Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por,
whereby Men are deprived of
their Senses.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Tully:</hi>
               <note place="margin">De Legi. L 1.</note> 
               <hi>Ex tot generibus, nullum
est animal,</hi> &amp;c. Amongst all the living
Creatures that are in the World, there
is none but Man that hath any noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a Deity; and amongst Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
there is no Nation so wild
and barbarous, but pretends to some
Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:95602:9"/>
And in another place, <hi>Quis hunc
bominem dixerit?</hi> &amp;c. Why should
such a one be accounted a Man, who,
by what he sees in the World, is not
convinced of a Deity, and a Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and of that adoration he owes
to it? Of the same sense is that of the
<hi>Satyrist,</hi> who speaking of Religion,
says this of it:

               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:95602:9"/>
As for that Inconvenience which some

persons will be hereby excluded:
Why so they are by the other Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
likewise; such persons having no

Mankind, such as would debase the
Nobility of our Natures, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of Brute Creatures, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are fit only to live amongst them.
Which brings me to the</p>
            <p>2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Consideration of Man as a <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciable</hi>
Creature. Religion is <hi>essential</hi> to
him in this respect also, as being the
surest Bond to tye men up to those
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95602:10"/>
respective duties towards one another,
without which Government and Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
could not subsist.</p>
            <p>There is a remarkable passage in <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi>
to this purpose, where he stiles
Religion, the <hi>Cement of all Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and the chief Basis of all Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Power.</hi> And in another place he
says,<note place="margin">Against <hi>Colotes.</hi>
               </note> That 'tis much more easie to build
a City in the open air, without any
ground to found it upon, than to
establish a Government without Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
<hi>A City</hi> (saith he) <hi>may make some
shift to subsist without Walls, Schools,
Theaters, Houses; nay, without Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
but not without Religon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it were not for this notion of a
Deity, and those natural impressions
which we have concerning Justice and
Probity, so necessary for the conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of Human Society; instead of
those well-ordered Governments and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95602:10"/>
Cities which are now in the World,
Mankind must have lived either wild
and solitary in Caves and Dens, like
Savage Beasts; or else in Troops of
Robbers, subsisting upon the spoile
and rapine of such as were weaker
than themselves.</p>

Take but away the awe of Religion,
and all that Fidelity and Justice, so
necessary for the keeping up of Human
Society, must perish with it.</p>
            <p>'Tis this fear of a Deity, and the
sense of our obligation to Him, that
is the only effectual means to restrain
Men within the bounds of Duty. And
were this wholly extinguished, there
would follow such wild Disorders and
Extravagancies amongst men, as would
not leave so much as the face or least
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95602:11"/>
shadow of Virtue or Honesty in the
World: There being no kind of Vice
which men would not abandon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
unto, considering the impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of their own natural appetites,
and the power of external temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
were this restraint from Religion
once removed or abolished.</p>
            <p>The two chief Opposites to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
are <hi>Prophaness</hi> and <hi>Superstition.</hi>
Both which, are prejudicial to Civil
Government: The one by <hi>destroying</hi>
Conscience, the strongest obligation
to Political Duties: The other by <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting</hi>
and abusing it; introducing in
the stead of it, a new <hi>Primium Mobile,</hi>
which ravisheth the Spheres of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and puts them into a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural
course,<note place="margin">L<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
                  <hi>Bacon</hi> Essays.</note> as a Noble Author
hath elegantly expressed it.</p>
            <p>The two grand Relations that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
Society, are <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:95602:11"/>
And Irreligion doth indispose
men for both these.</p>
            <p>1. For <hi>Government.</hi> Without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
Magistrates will lose that Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and Confidence belonging to their
stations, which they cannot so well
exert in punishing the offences of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
when they are guilty of the
same or the like themselves. <hi>Those that
sit on the Throne of Iudgment, should be
able to scatter away evil with their
eyes,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> speaks, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 8.
By their very presence and look, to
strike an awe upon offenders. Which
will not be so easily done, if they should
lye under the same guilt themselves.
<hi>Sine Bonitate nulla Majestas,</hi> saith <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca:</hi>
The very nature of Majesty
doth denote <hi>Goodness</hi> as well as <hi>Power.</hi>
And without this, Governours may
easily lose that <hi>Reverence</hi> which is due
to them from others; and consequently
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95602:12"/>
that <hi>Authority</hi> which they ought to
have over them. When they cease to
be Gods in respect of their <hi>Goodness,</hi>
they may diminish in their <hi>Power.</hi>
And though they should be able to
keep men under as to their Bodies and
Estates, yet will they decline as to
that awful love and reverence whereby
they should sway over the Hearts and
Affections of men.</p>
            <p>The Philosopher in the fift Book of
his Politicks,<note place="margin">Cap. 11.</note> doth lay it down as a rule
for Magistrates, That they must be
careful to give publike testimonies of
their being religious and devout; for
which he gives this double reason: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the people will be less subject to
entertain any jealousie or suspition of
<hi>suffering injury</hi> from such whom they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
to be religious. And withall, they
will be less subject to <hi>attempt the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of injury</hi> against such; as knowing,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:95602:12"/>
that good Magistrates are after a more
especial manner under the Divine Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
and Protection, having God to
fight with them, and for them.</p>
            <p>2. The want of Religion will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispose
men for the condition of <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi>
and render them loose and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable
in those duties of obedience and
submission required to that state. How
can it be expected from that man who
dares affront and despise God Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
that he should have any hearty
reverence for His Deputies and Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerents?
Those who are destitute of
Religion and Conscience, as they are
not to be trusted in any <hi>ordinary pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate</hi>
duty towards those with whom
they converse, much less can they be
useful in any such <hi>extraordinary</hi> Action,
whereby the <hi>publike</hi> welfare is to be
promoted. Where there are no seeds of
Piety and Virtue, there can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95602:13"/>
of Honour or Magnanimity.</p>
            <p>He that is subject only upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of <hi>Wrath,</hi> and the <hi>power of the
Sword which is over him,</hi> will be no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
so, when he hath an opportunity of
escaping or resisting that Power. Nor
is there any possible way to secure men
in their quiet subjection and obedience,
but by their being obliged <hi>for Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
sake.</hi> And therefore such kind of
persons, as by their open prophaness
and contempt of Religion, do endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to destroy Conscience from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
men, may justly be esteemed
as the worst kind of Seditious Persons,
and most pernicious to Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Whatever Disputes have been rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
concerning the lawfulness of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
men for their dissenting Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in matters of Religion; yet never
any man questioned the lawfulness of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95602:13"/>
punishing men for their prophaness and
contempt of all Religion. Such men
as renounce Conscience, cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
that they suffer for it. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
this Vice doth upon many ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
deserve the greatest severity of
Laws, as being <hi>in its own nature</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
of the very Principles of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and the Peace of all Human
Societies: Besides the Mischiefs <hi>conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent</hi>
upon it from Divine Vengeance.</p>
            <p>So that upon all these accounts, there
is just reason to inferr the truth of this
Proposition, That Religion is <hi>totum
hominis</hi> in this first sense, as it referrs
to the <hi>Essence</hi> of Man considered either
<hi>Separately,</hi> or as a Member of <hi>Society.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. 'Tis so likewise with respect to
the <hi>Happiness</hi> and well-being of Man.
That is properly said to be the chief
End or Happiness of a thing, which
doth raise its nature to the utmost per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:95602:14"/>
of which it is capable according
to its rank and kind. So the chief good
belonging to a Vegetable or <hi>Plant,</hi> is
to grow up to a state of maturity, to
continue to its natural period, and to
propagate its Kind, which is the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
perfection that kind of Being is
capable of. And whereas <hi>Sensitive</hi> Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
besides those things which are
common to them with <hi>Plants,</hi> have
likewise such faculties, whereby they
are able to apprehend external objects,
and to receive pain or pleasure from
them: Therefore the Happiness proper
to them, must consist in the Perfection
of these Faculties, namely, in sensible
pleasures, the enjoying of such things
as may be grateful to their sences. But
now <hi>Mankind,</hi> (if we will allow it to
be a distinct rank of Creatures superior
to Brutes) being endowed with such
Faculties, whereby 'tis made capable
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95602:14"/>
of Apprehending a Deity, and of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
a future state after this life; It
will hence follow, That the proper
happiness of man must consist in the
perfecting of this Faculty; namely, in
such a state as may reconcile him to
the Divine Favour, and afford him
the best assurance of a blessed Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
hereafter. Which nothing else
but Religion can so much as pretend
to. And that this is most agreeable to
Natural Light, may appear, from the
Testimonies of several of the wisest
Heathens, <hi>Pythagoras, Plato, Epictetus,</hi>
&amp;c. who assert a Man's Happiness, or
chief End, to consist in a likeness or
resemblance to the Divine Nature, In
following of God, Endeavouring to
imitate Him whom we worship; which
are but several descriptions of Religion.</p>
            <p>'Tis true indeed, the nature of <hi>Man,</hi>
by reason of those other Capacities,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95602:15"/>
common to him with <hi>Plants</hi> and <hi>Brutes,</hi>
may stand in need of several other
things, to render his condition plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
and comfortable in this World, as
<hi>Health, Riches, Reputation, Safety,</hi> &amp;c.
Now herein is the great advantage of
Religion, that besides the principal
work which it doth for us, in securing
our future Estates in the other World;
It is likewise the most effectual means to
promote our happiness in this World;
and that not only <hi>Morally,</hi> upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of that Reward which Virtuous
Actions do entitle a man unto from a
just and a wise Providence: But <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally</hi>
also, by reason of that Physical
efficacy, which the Duties of Religion
have in procuring for us each of those
things, wherein our Temporal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
doth consist; in promoting the
welfare not only of <hi>particular</hi> persons,
but of <hi>publike</hi> Communities, of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95602:15"/>
in general, and of the whole <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverse.</hi>
Insomuch, that if we could
suppose our selves in a capacity of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulating
with God, concerning the
Terms upon which we would submit
to this Government, and to chuse the
Laws we would be bound to observe,
It were not possible for us, to make any
Proposals, which upon all accounts
should be more advantagious to our own
Interests, than those very Conditions,
to which we are obliged by the rules of
Religion and Virtue. And herein doth
the reasonableness of Religion, and the
Beauty, and Wisdom of Providence
most eminently appear towards Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
in governing us by such Laws as do
most apparently tend to the perfecting
of our Natures, and in making that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be our <hi>Duty,</hi> which is our <hi>Interest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Religion is <hi>Totum hominis,</hi> with
respect to the chief <hi>Business</hi> and <hi>Duty</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:95602:16"/>
of Man, that which he ought to be
most intent upon, and conversant
about, as to his Employment in this
World. That <hi>General</hi> calling to which
every man of what rank or quality
soever is to be engaged. Men are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed
under other <hi>particular</hi> callings,
according as their Education, Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
Friends, and several Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
do dispose of them. But the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
of Religion, being of univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
concernment, doth extend to all
and every particular, there being none
exempted from it. <hi>Hoc est omnis homo,</hi>
Every man is concerned in it. And it
is <hi>Totum hominis</hi> likewise; 'Tis his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
the chief business about which he
is to be employed.</p>
            <p>I do not say, that a man's thoughts
are always to be taken up about the
immediate Acts of Religion, any more
than a Traveller is always to have his
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:95602:16"/>
mind actually fixed upon the thought
of his journey's end. This would be
inconsistent with the infirmity of our
natures, and the necessity of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
in this World. But yet, as he
that is upon a journey, doth so order
all his <hi>Particular</hi> Motions, as may be
most conducible to his <hi>General</hi> End; so
should men <hi>habitually,</hi> though they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<hi>actually,</hi> in every affair have respect to
their chief End, so as to observe all the
duties of Religion, and never to allow
themselves in any thing against the rules
of it. And he that hath this care conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
upon his mind, (though he be
but a Secular person) may properly be
said to make Religion his <hi>Business.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Wise man, in the beginning of
this Book, had proposed it as his grand
Query to be discussed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ch. 2. 3.</note> 
               <hi>to find out</hi> what
was that good for the sons of men, which
they should do under the Heavens, all the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:95602:17"/>
days of their lives. <hi>(i.e.) What was the
chief employment or business, which
they should apply themselves to in this
World. And here in the Text he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts
it to be the business of Religion,</hi>
Fearing God, and keeping his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
<hi>Suitable to that Precept of</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 10. 12. And now, O Israel,
what doth the Lord thy God require of thee,
but to fear the Lord thy God, to walk
in his ways, and to serve the Lord thy
God, and keep his Commandments: <hi>And
the</hi> Practise <hi>of St.</hi> Paul, <hi>who made this
his daily</hi> exercise, to keep his Conscience
void of offence, both towards God, and
towards men.</p>
            <p>To the Reasonableness of this, seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of the wisest Heathens have attest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
That's a remarkable passage in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle</hi>
to this purpose,<note place="margin">Moral. 1. ad Eudem in fine.</note> where he states
that to be the most desirable proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all Worldly Felicities and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:95602:17"/>
which is most consistent with
men's devoting themselves to the business
of Religion: And that to be either too
much or too little of Wealth, or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
or Power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereby men are
hindred in their meditating upon God,
or their worshipping of him.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Epictetus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dissert. 1. 6.</note> discoursing concerning
the work and business he was designed
to, hath this passage: If I had been
made a Nightingale or a Swan, I should
have employed the time of my life in such
a way as is suitable to the conditions of
those Creatures: But being made a Man,
capable of serving and worshipping that
God from whom I had my Being, 'tis
but reason that I should apply my self
to this, as being my proper work and
business: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. And therefore
hereunto will I devote my self, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the chief Employment to which I
am designed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:95602:18"/>
So <hi>Antoninus:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lib. 8. Sect. 19.</note> Every thing (saith
he) is designed for some kind of work.
Beasts and Plants, the Sun and Starrs,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, And what do you conceive
your business to be? Sensual pleasures?
Bethink your self a little better, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this be suitable to the nobility of
your nature, and those excellent fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
with which you are endowed?</p>
            <p>Men usually apply themselves to that
as their chief business, which may quit
cost and be worth their labour, by which
their Interest is most promoted. And
there is nothing can be more reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
than for that to be the chief bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
of a man's life, which is the chief
end of his Being. Which is the third
thing I proposed to speak to.</p>
            <p>I crave leave to mention two Inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
very briefly by way of Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and I have done.</p>
            <p>If this be so, that Religion is of so
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:95602:18"/>
great Importance, that it may be sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the <hi>Whole of man,</hi> with reference
to all those things that are of greatest
moment, The <hi>Essence,</hi> the <hi>Happiness,</hi>
the <hi>Business</hi> of Man:</p>
            <p>1. What Monsters of Folly, and
Madness, and Contradiction, must those
men be, who do upon this account put
a greater value upon themselves, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more learned, and wise, and better
than others, because they can contemn
and despise Religion? Certainly, by all
the Laws of God and Men, such Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creants
ought to be rendered most vile
and contemptible themselves. Their
Discourses ought not to be listned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
without nauseousness and detestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Their Persons should be used as
the Lepers were under the Law, whose
company every one was obliged to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void,
as being unclean infectious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
And perhaps this might be one
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:95602:19"/>
good way, if not of Curing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
yet of hindring their Mischiefs
upon others, when they should find
themselves abhorred and abandoned by
all sober men.</p>
            <p>2. How dear should the Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Religion be to every one of
us. How serious should we be in the
Profession and Practise of it ourselves.
How zealous in promoting the Honour
and the Power of it amongst others.
The things of this World are full of
uncertainty, and of short continuance.
<hi>When a few days are past, we must all of
us go to the place whence we shall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</hi>
And when we come to dye, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
then will be of any advantage to
us, but Religion, <hi>The testimony of our
Consciences, that in simplicity and godly
sincerity, we have had our Conversation
in this world.</hi> Upon which we may
confidently expect, that <hi>there is laid up
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:95602:19"/>
for us a Crown of Righteousness, which
the Lord the Righteouus Iudg, will give
unto us at the day of his Appearance;</hi> when
He shall come to <hi>bring every work into
judgment, with every secret thing, whether
it be good, or whether it be evil.</hi>
