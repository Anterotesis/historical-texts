         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Had not troubled thee with theſe Papers out of the
Preſs, had not the unreaſonableneſs of thoſe, who
miniſtred the occaſion, or neceſſity rather, of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
of them, uncivilly denyed the liberty of an orall
prolation of them, when time, and place; and a good
conſcience, required it at my hand. At the former of the two late
Conferences or Disputes held in <hi>All-hallows</hi> the Great, <hi>London,</hi>
between Mr <hi>J: Simſon,</hi> and my ſelf, he was pleaſed, upon no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
at all given by me, to traduce me before the whole Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
there aſſembled, conſiſting of ſome thouſands of people, as a
man holding <hi>Free-Will</hi> in oppoſition to <hi>Free-Grace.</hi> At the latter
of the ſaid Conferences, perceiving him not altogether ſo knowing
what my ſence or opinion was in the ſaid points, and upon this
ground, fearing the like of his Friends and Followers, who made
up a great part of the preſent Auditory, as well to relieve their
ignorance herein, and free them from the guilt of an unchriſtian
ſurmiſe against their Chriſtian Brother, who never injured them,
nor any one of them, in the leaſt, as alſo to wipe off the blot from my
ſelf, which I had contracted by oppoſing uncivil men in the way of
their error, I was deſirous to have given an account of my Faith
touching the ſaid particulars, together with the Queſtion agreed
upon for preſent debate, in the preſence of thoſe that were there
met to hear. But he that had the face to charge unduly, had not
the heart either to ſtand by ſo unworthy an action, or to acknowledg
the unworthineſs of it. For when I deſired leave over and over,
and that with much earneſtneſs, to have given ſome brief account
to the people of my judgment, touching the things unjuſtly charged
upon me by my Antagoniſt, he peremptorily denyed it: and as oft
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:114812:3"/>
as I made offer to ſpeak upon this account, he, in a very unſeemly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and with clamour, interrupted me, and ſuffered me not to ſpeak.
Nor do I think that there can be an inſtance of a like unmanlike car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
produced out of al Histories or Records whatſoever; I mean,
that a perſon wrongfully accuſed, ſhould not be permitted by his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer,
to ſpeak what he hath to ſay in order to his purgation. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cake of the ſame dough was this. When I reaſoned thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
his moſt abſurd (and indeed blasphemous) opinion of Gods
reprobating men from eternity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If God reprobated men from eternity, then he reprobated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi>
[there being, neither thing, nor perſon from eternity, to
reprobate, unleſs men will ſay, that he ſhould reprobate
himſelf.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But God did not reprobate himſelf. Ergo.</hi> He, with his train
of Diſciples, (whether out of weakneſs, or a worſe principle, I will
not judg) expreſſed themſelves with a kind of zealous indignation,
as if I had ſpoken blasphemy, and affirmed, that God <hi>reprobated
himſelf;</hi> whereas expreſly, and in ſo many words, I affirmed the
quite contrary (as the minor in the recited Syllogiſm plainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports)
charging that blasphemy, as a direct and unavoydable conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of his Opinion; from which, neither he, nor his co-adjutors,
were then able to vindicate the ſaid opinion, nor will be able to the
days of eternity.</p>

Prophet, with an addition of more <hi>words like</hi> unto thoſe written
in the former<note n="a" place="margin">Ier. 36. 32.</note>: So neither hath my Antagoniſt gained any thing
by ſtopping my mouth at the Diſpute, in not ſuffering me there to
make ſtreight, what he had made crooked, but only the publiſhing
of the ſame things there intended to have been ſpoken, to the cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Queſtion to be taken into conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and debated at preſent, is, <hi>Whether
the Gentiles, who wanted the Miniſtry
of the Goſpel by men, had not ſufficient
means notwithſtanding to be ſaved.</hi> I
am here (God aſſiſting) to make proof of
the affirmative; <hi>viz. That ſuch Heathen
had ſufficient means for Salvation, ſuch
a want notwithſtanding.</hi> But firſt I muſt
crave leave to open the ſtate of the queſtion, and to declare in what
ſence I hold and maintain, <hi>That the Heathen, under the want of
the Miniſtry of the Goſpel by men, have yet ſufficient means vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed
unto them by God whereby to be ſaved.</hi> I have ſo much the
greater neceſſity lying upon me to give you a clear and diſtinct ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of what my ſence and judgment is in the preſent Queſtion,
becauſe by ſome words which fell from the Opponent at our laſt
Diſpute in this place, I clearly perceived that he altogether miſtakes
my opinion in the preſent Controverſies. For he was pleas'd to
ſay, that I <hi>maintain Free-Will in oppoſition to Free-Grace,</hi> (or
words to this effect) and pleaded this as a ground, why he could not
give the right hand of Chriſtian fellowſhip unto me. Now, to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:114812:4"/>
ſatisfie both him, and all you that are preſent, I here declare this day
in the preſence of God and all his holy Angels, before you, and to
all the world, I hold no freedom of Will, nor any thing elſe, not
any opinion whatſoever, in any the leaſt oppoſition to Free-Grace.
Yea whenſoever his opinion and mine, touching the freedom of the
will in man, and of the Grace of God in Jeſus Chriſt towards men,
ſhall come into a clear light, and be duly compared together. I
know with the knowledg of a full aſſurance, that his opinion will
(of the two) be found to be the far greater Exaltreſs of free-will
in men, and the greater abaſer of the Grace of God. There are
many hundreds preſent, that have heard me from time to time deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
my judgment in publique, and many in private, touching the
preſent Controverſies: I appeal to them all, <hi>conjunctim &amp; divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſim,</hi>
whether ever they heard me utter ſo much as the leaſt word
tending to exalt the freedom of the will of man unto that which is
good. My preſent opinion is, and my conſtant Doctrine hath been,
That the will of man deſtitute of the Grace of God, and his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operating
aſſiſtance with it, is, or would be, moſt deſperately wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and ſervile unto ſin. Yea and further, that notwithſtanding
the co-operative Grace of God with it, yet it is exceeding apt and
prone to be led captive unto ſin by the Devil. Whereas the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of my Antagoniſt (being truly and fairly interpreted) if it be
contrary unto mine, is, That the will of man, by means of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operating
Grace of God with it, becomes free after the manner of
the freedom of the Will of God himſelf, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſo free unto that which
is good, that it is unpoſſible for it not to move or to be carried out
unto it.</p>
            <p>Concerning the Grace of God, there are three things, wherein
the glory of it conſiſts: the freeneſs of it: the fulneſs or extent of
it: the force or efficacy of it.</p>
            <p>Concerning the firſt of theſe, I clearly hold, and have upon all
occaſions conſtantly taught, 1. That the whole plot or counſel of
God concerning the Salvation of the World, is of free Grace, of meer
Grace, and goodneſs of Will, or pleaſure in God. 2. That his
purpoſe of Election, or Predeſtination of men unto life and glory,
is an act of free Grace alſo; and that there was no obligation or
neceſſity upon him to predeſtinate any man, or any ſort of men, as
now he hath done. 3. That the gift of Jeſus Chriſt unto the
World, is a gift of free Grace, and that God was no ways obliged
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:114812:4"/>
hereunto. 4. That, to give or confer Juſtification, Adoption, and
Salvation it ſelf, upon believing in Jeſus Chriſt, are acts of the pure
and free Grace of God. 5. That to give ſtrength, power, and means
of believing unto men, is an act of meer and free Grace likewiſe.
6. That it is of the free Grace of God, and by the help, and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
thereof, that any man doth ever actually believe.</p>
            <p>2. Concerning the fulneſs, or extent of this Grace; my ſence
is, and my Doctrine hath been, 1. In reſpect of perſons, that it is not
impriſon'd or confin'd, within the narrow Compaſs of an handful
of men, in compariſon; or that it extends it ſelf, either in the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Salvation, or in the proviſions which it makes, or affords
unto men for Salvation, only unto thoſe few, who come in time
actually to believe, and to be ſaved, but that like the Sun in the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament
of Heaven, it compaſſeth the whole Earth from the one end
of it unto the other, and ſtretcheth it ſelf unto all men. 2. In reſpect
of the Good, which it intends unto men, my opinion is, That it is
exceeding <hi>full</hi> and comprehenſive, <hi>i. e.</hi> That the good, or bleſſedneſs
which God graciouſly intends unto men, in, and by the Goſpel, is a
<hi>full,</hi> abſolute, and compleat Bleſſedneſs, containing every good and
deſireable thing in it. 3. (And laſtly, for this) That in reſpect of
the means, which it vouchſafeth and exhibiteth unto men, for the
bringing them to the full enjoyment, of this bleſſedneſs, it is full and
compleat alſo: ſo that the means, which God graciouſly exhibiteth
unto men to make them bleſſed, are everyways ſufficient for ſuch
a purpoſe, or end.</p>
            <p>3. Concerning the power or effectualneſs of this Grace, I hold,
and teach (upon all occaſions) 1. That in the gift of a power, or a
ſufficiency of means unto men, whereby to believe, or to be ſaved,
it is ſimply irreſiſtible, and that men cannot fruſtrate or hinder this
operation of it. 2. That what good thing ſoever any man doth,
he doth it through the aſſiſtance of the free Grace of God, and is
in no capacity or meetneſs ſo much as to conceive or think a good
thought without it: 3. And laſtly, That when any man actually belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth,
or is truly converted unto God, that he is mightily ſtrengthned
and aſſiſted by the ſupernatural, or ſpecial Grace of God thereunto:
So that the act of Converſion, or believing, is to be aſcribed unto
God, not only as the ſole Author and giver of that power, by which
men do believe, but as the ſole ſupernatural Actor alſo of this power
in the Act it ſelf of believing; and that man, when he doth believe,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:114812:5"/>
is ſo far from having any cauſe, or ground of boaſting in himſelf,
becauſe of this his believing, that he hath all the reaſon in the world
to confeſs and ſay (in our Saviours preſcript of words) That he is
<hi>an unprofitable Servant, and hath only done that which was his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
and that in abundance, <hi>to do.</hi> Only I conceive that men are not
neceſſitated by this Grace of God, or any working thereof, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
whether they will or no: nor yet made willing upon any ſuch
terms, but that there is a poſſibility left unto them of nilling, or of
remaining unwilling, to any moment or point of time, until the act
it ſelf of believing be produced.</p>
            <p>So that my opinion concerning the Grace of God, being truly
compared with the opinion of thoſe that diſſent from me, appears
to have much more in it for the exaltation of the Grace of God,
then theirs: and theirs much more in it for the exaltation of the
will of man, then mine. For 1. My opinion makes the Grace of
God ſo free, as to enrich the whole world, and all that is called man
in it; and that without the leaſt engagement upon God from men
thereunto: Whereas their opinion impriſons it within a narrow
compaſs of men (in compariſon) and ſo bridles or ſtiffles the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of it (in that conſideration.) 2. As in one branch of their
opinion, they ſtiffle and deſtroy the glory of the freeneſs of it, ſo in
another, they quite deſtroy the very nature or eſſence of it, and make
it to be no Grace at all. For that opinion, which makes the Grace
of God, the fountain or cauſe of no other actions in men, then ſuch,
as God cannot, according to the Law and conſtant method of his
remunerative juſtice, or bounty, reward, deſtroys the very nature of
Grace. And that the opinion, maintained by our Oppoſers, doth
this, is evident from hence; <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe that, making men to act
neceſſarily and unavoydably, by means of the grace which is given
them, maketh them to act phyſically, or as meer natural Agents, and
ſo reduceth all that they do by vertue of the Grace of God, to the
Law and Condition of meer natural actions, which, by the ſtanding
Law of Gods remunerative bounty, are not capable of reward by
God.</p>
            <p>Again, That their Opinion, tends many thouſand degrees, more
then mine, to magnifie the wills of men, is evident thus: I affirm
the wil of man even under the ſtrongeſt and moſt effectual motions
of the Grace of God, whereof it is capable (the nature and eſſential
liberty of it only preſerv'd) to be in a capacity of ſinning, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:114812:5"/>
doing that which is evil (which is the greateſt abaſement of the
will, that can well be imagined;) whereas the other opinion, maketh
the wills of men, under the effectual motions of the Grace of God
unto that which is good like unto the will of God himſelf; I mean,
neceſſarily and unchangeably good, and free from all poſſibility of
ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ing, which is the higheſt exaltation of the will, that can well be
conceived. And beſides, that opinion, making men unable to do
righteouſly, for want of the Grace of God, when they ſin and do
wickedly, takes off the ſhame, and demerit of ſinning from the wills
of men, and either caſts them upon God for denying his Grace unto
them, or elſe reſolves them into nothing. Whereas the opinion
aſſerted by me, affirming, That men, when they ſin and do wickedly,
have ſufficient means from God to refrain ſin, and to do righteouſly,
reſolves the ſhame and whole demerit of ſinning into men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and their wills, and ſo renders them inexcuſeable. Thus
you ſee how unjuſtly, and with manifeſt untruth, I have been
charged to hold Free-Will againſt Free-Grace: and how that my
Accuſers are the guilty perſons themſelves.</p>
            <p>Concerning my opinion about the death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which is, That
he dyed for the Salvation of all men, without exception of any, and
conſequently for the Heathen, as well thoſe who do enjoy the oral
Miniſtry of the Goſpel, as thoſe that want it; I herein hold nothing,
but what was generally taught, and received, in the primitive
Churches of Chriſt, for three hundred years together, and more, next
after the times of the Apoſtles (which are by all our modern Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Divines, and by <hi>Calvin</hi> in ſpecial manner, acknowledged
for times, wherein Chriſtian Religion raigned in her greateſt purity,
and ſoundneſs of Doctrine) as I am able to make ſubſtantial proof
by expreſs teſtamonies, and theſe not a few, from the beſt Records

            <p>Yea, theſe Theological truths, <hi>That Chriſt dyed for all men,

of <hi>Christ,</hi> and of the Goſpel, that as the <hi>Roman</hi> Orator ſaid of

Communities, that Theeves themſelves, who are enemies to it,
and live by injustice towards others, yet cannot want it amongst
themſelves;</hi> So neither can thoſe men, who profeſs enmity and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
to the ſaid Opinions, hardly preach, hardly write, any
thing to purpoſe, concerning the Goſpel, but they are neceſſitated
to make uſe of them, and to aſſert them, either in expreſſneſs of
terms and words, or in their clear and manifeſt principles. The
writings of <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf, and ſo of <hi>Bucer, Muſculus, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſine,
Bullinger,</hi> with ſeveral other Reformed Divines, who are gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
taken for men of a contrary Judgment, yet do their writings
(I ſay) frequently teach and avouch them, and that in as plain and
ample terms, as any Remonſtrant can lightly expreſs his ſence about
them. Yea, theſe truths were too hard for the Synod of <hi>Dort</hi> it
ſelf, and now and then gain'd teſtimony from them, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their ſolemn and ſacred engagement to devote themſelves and
the beſt of their Synodical Endevors, to oppoſe and ſuppreſs them.
What I have now onely affirmed, and this in the general, I ſhall,
God willing, and ſparing me in life and health for the ſervice, in due
time make to appear in particulars. In the mean time, if you, that
are preſent, ſhall pleaſe narrowly to obſerve, and conſider, the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
which you ordinarily hear from your Miniſters, or minde their
printed books upon ſome ſubjects, you ſhall ever and anon very ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently
find ſuch things aſſerted &amp; delivered by them, which cannot
ſtand, nor make any tolerable ſence, much leſs Divinity, but by the
credit and countenance of the Opinions I ſpeak of, and which they
notwithſtanding ſo zealouſly pretend to abominate. I could weary
you with inſtances in this kinde: but if you will afford me your
Chriſtian patience in harkening (at preſent) unto two onely, I ſhall
excuſe you for the reſt, till ſome better conveniency of time. The
former of the two conſiſts of ſeveral paſſages in a Sermon lately
preached before the Lord Major of your City (and more lately
printed) by Mr <hi>Powel,</hi> an Arch-ſtickler about theſe late Diſputes,
and a zealous Defender of that Faith, which teacheth him to doubt
whether <hi>Christ</hi> dyed for him, or no, yea or for any one of all thoſe,
to whom he preacheth the Goſpel, and makes a tender of <hi>Christ,</hi>
at any time, yea or for any one of his Nation. Thus then Mr <hi>Powel,</hi>

ask, is the Pardon for me? and another queſtion. Is the Pardon
for me? He would anſwer, It is for you that are Priſoners, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

you, that are ſinful men and women, who are Priſoners under the

                  <hi>Anſ. My beloved,</hi> Think you that Chriſts Intentions, and his

But mark it well (and miſtake me not) I do not mean that he ſaith

            <p>Certainly, <hi>Arminius</hi> himſelf could not have <hi>Arminianiz'd</hi> in the

whom yet other-while they judg the happieſt men in the world,
thus: <hi>Thouſands, and ten thouſands of poor Souls, which Christ
hath ranſomed with his blood, ſhall hereby be betrayed, ſeduced,
and endangered to be undone to all eternity.</hi> Here we have the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Univerſal Redemption, fully, and with open face, aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
in as much, as they who are <hi>ranſomed by the blood of Christ,</hi>
are ſaid to be <hi>endangered</hi> to be <hi>undone to all eternity.</hi> He that is
in <hi>danger</hi> of an evil, or miſery, may very poſſibly fall into it. <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>
doth not onely imply a poſſibility, but even a probability, or
likelyhood of ſuffering. So then, <hi>if thouſands ranſomed by the
blood of Christ,</hi> may be brought into <hi>danger of being undone for all
eternity;</hi> they very poſsibly may ſuffer ſuch an <hi>undoing,</hi> and ſo periſh
<hi>for all eternity.</hi> If the <hi>ranſomed</hi> by <hi>Chriſt</hi> may periſh <hi>for all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>

there is not the leaſt poſsibility, but the Rebrobate alſo, or thoſe
who periſh; and conſequently, all men.</p>
            <p>For any men to pretend or plead, that though there be an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsibility,
in reſpect of the Purpoſe and Decree of God, that
thoſe, <hi>whom Chriſt hath ranſomed with his blood, ſhould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
to all eternity,</hi> yet they may be ſaid to be in <hi>danger</hi> of being
thus <hi>undone,</hi> in reſpect of ſuch means, which have a direct tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
towards the <hi>undoing</hi> of <hi>Souls</hi> in ſuch a way, as the ſpreading
of Errors and Hereſies is, &amp;c. ſuch a pretence (I ſay) and plea, as
this, is no ſalve at all for the ſore. For there is not the leaſt danger
of ſuffering inconvenience by any ſuch means, or cauſes, how likely
or threatening ſoever, in themſelves ſimply conſidered, to bring the
inconvenience upon us, which we certainly know to be throughly
mated and over-ballanced by means and cauſes of a contrary tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency

us? Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect?
It is God that juſtifieth, &amp;c.</hi> Which kinde of arguing clearly impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that where, and in what caſe ſoever, we have God for our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,
we are in no danger at all of ſuffering. And it is a Maxim
in the Civil Law; That <hi>Omnia invalida pro nihilo ſunt habenda:
i. e.</hi> All means that are inſufficient, are to be reputed as none. Souls
that are ſecured by any Decree of God, are in no more <hi>danger</hi> of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>undone to all eternity,</hi> by <hi>Errors and Hereſies,</hi> then by read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Roman</hi> or <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Hiſtories, or by any other means, how
irrelative ſoever to ſuch an effect: in as much as Errors and Hereſies,
bear no more proportion in their deſtroying, or <hi>undoing</hi> properties,
to the ſaving or preſerving power of God, then the reading of the
ſaid Hiſtories, or any other means, how inconſiderable ſoever in their
relation to the ſame effect.</p>
            <p>Nor is the inſtance from <hi>Act.</hi> 27. wherein thoſe, whoſe lives
God had promiſed to ſave, are ſaid notwithſtanding to have been
in danger of drowning, of any better accommodation, to deliver
the ſaid paſſage from the Orthodox errour of a cleer comport
with the Doctrine of Univerſall Redemption, then the former
arguing. For evident it is, from thoſe words, <hi>ver. 31. Except
theſe abide in the ſhip, ye cannot be ſaved,</hi> that that expreſſion of the
Angel unto <hi>Paul,</hi> verſ. 24. <hi>And lo, God hath given thee all them
that ſail with thee,</hi> did not import any abſolute purpoſe of God
to ſave the lives of all thoſe in the ſhip with him, but onely a
conditionall; it being a thing very frequent in the Scripture, to
expreſſe both ſuch purpoſes, and ſuch promiſes, of God, in an
abſolute and un-conditioned form of words, the execution and
performance whereof, in reſpect of the things purpoſed, or promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
are never the leſs ſuſpended upon conditions. Inſtances here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we ſhal (God willing) produce many upon a more material oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.
Therefore the ſafety of the lives of thoſe men, to whom
<hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Except theſe abide in the ſhip, ye cannot be ſaved,</hi> was
not under any abſolute Decree or promiſe of God, as the ſouls of
thoſe that are <hi>ranſomed by the blood of Chriſt</hi> (according to the
conſtant Aſſertion of the 52 ſubſcribers of the paſſage mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned)
are; God never ſubjecting any thing poſitively and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
decreed by him, unto any condition whatſoever perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:114812:8"/>
by man. So that the ſubſcribers are moſt palpable ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inconſiſtents;
nor doth the inſtance now argued, take the leaſt
pitie or compaſſion on them in covering that their ſhame.</p>
            <p>I have only this one word to add, touching the ſence, wherein
I hold a ſufficiencie of means to beleeve, or to be ſaved, vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed
unto the Heathen, who wanted the Miniſtry of the Goſpel
by men. By a ſufficiencie of means to beleeve, I do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
an immediate ſufficiencie, but a mediate or remote ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie.
By an immediate ſufficiencie of means to do a thing, I
mean ſuch a ſufficiency, whereby a man is enabled to do the thing,
without having any more means in order hereunto, then what
he hath at preſent. Thus a man that underſtands a language, and
hath his ſenſe of hearing perfect, hath an immediate ſufficiencie
of means to underſtand the mind of him that ſpeaketh audibly
unto him in that language. He ſtands in need of nothing more
for ſuch a purpoſe. By a mediate or remote ſufficiencie of means
to do a thing, I mean ſuch a ſufficiencie by which, though a man
is not inabled without further proviſion of means, to do the
thing, yet he is inabled to make ſuch a farther proviſion in this
kind, that having made it, he becomes immediately qualified, or
able to do it. A man endued with reaſon, memory, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
&amp; having the opportunity of an able teacher, to inſtruct
him in the knowledge of a ſtrange language, and which at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
he underſtandeth not, hath a remote ſufficiencie of means to
underſtand this language, and by a due improvement of theſe
means, though remote, is very capable of obtaining ſuch a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencie
of means hereunto, which is immediate. With this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
kind of ſufficiencie, I affirm, the Gentiles, who wanted the
Miniſtry of the Goſpell, had notwithſtanding a ſufficiencie of
means to beleeve to the ſaving of the ſoul. The Heathen were
ſufficiently qualified or furniſhed by God for the doing of thoſe
things, by which they might, and ſhould, if they had done them,
have been brought to an immediate capacitie of beleeving.</p>
            <p>By beleeving unto Salvation, I mean ſuch a Faith in God, or
ſuch a dependance or reliance upon him, which is proper and
ſufficient to have led them into ſuch ways, wherein God would
have ſaved them, had they walked in them, according to that of
the Apoſtle; <hi>If there be firſt a willing mind, it is accepted accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not</hi>
