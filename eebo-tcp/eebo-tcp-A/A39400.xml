            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HAving with the advice of a Counſel of War ſet down Rules and Orders for the future diſcharge of Quarters, as alſo for the better prevention and redreſs of any diſorders of the Soldiery; I have here ſent unto you Copies of thoſe Orders, and do deſire your ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy care, that they may be made known throughout your County, that all may take notice what they are to expect from the Soldiery, and what lies upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for prevention or redreſs of any injury done to them from the Soldier. I deſire alſo, That every Juſtice of Peace reſiding in your County, may have a ſeveral Copy of the Orders. And for the yet more aſſured ſatisfaction of Quarters, I ſhall adde this (which alſo I deſire may be imparted to each Juſtice of Peace, and made known through the County) That if, notwithſtanding theſe ſtrict Rules and Penalties, any one ſhall preſume to ſhift away, leaving his Quarters not diſcharged according to theſe Orders, I deſire the Committee, or any Juſtice of Peace in the County, would take Information thereof from the parties ſo injured (with the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony upon Oath of ſome perſon beſide himſelf) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing

Laſtly, as to the time for which Quarters are to be paid, you may take notice, that the whole Army hath lately received Pay, and Command to diſcharge Quarters from the Fourth of this inſtant <hi>January</hi> forwards: And if future want of Pay ſhall neceſſitate the diſcontinuance while any of the Army Quarters in your County, you ſhall have notice thereof.

            <p>YOu may perceive in the Orders I herewith ſend you, what proviſion is made, That no Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (upon any abuſe or diſorder of Soldiers) needs be afraid to complain to their Officers, nor doubt much of preſent redreſs through their hands; or, if he fail thereof (through the Officers connivance or neglect) he needs but remember what Officer he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained unto, and th' Officer ſhall be reſponſal for the Offence: But farther, if the Countrey man finde not redreſs in that courſe, or be yet fearful to go that way, I ſhall be content that he make his complaint to you, or (for his yet more eaſe) to the next Juſtice of Peace; And do deſire, That the Juſtice would take the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and (aſſigning a day for both parties, with their Witneſſes, to appear before him) would in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting under his Hand, give notice thereof, and of the Offenders Name, to the next Commiſſion-Officer, having command over him, and upon the appearance, would, with ſuch Officers aſſiſtance, hear both parties, take their Allegations, and Examine upon Oath the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41590:8"/>
Witneſſes on each ſide, and if thereupon the party complained of appear culpable, and the Offence ſuch, as that the Juſtice and Officer aſſiſting cannot well end it by award (to the preſent ſatisfaction of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grieved, or puniſhment of the Offender) but that it need or deſerve a more publique Tryal, That then the Juſtice, with the Officer (or the Juſtice alone, if the Officer refuſe to joyn) would certifie the whole Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations and Evidence, and ſend the ſame, ſealed up, either unto me, or to the chief Commander of the Brigade quartering in the Countrey, who ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon order a Court of War to proceed to more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Tryal and Cenſure of the buſineſs, without far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trouble of Witneſſe to the Complainant, if that Evidence be full and clear: And to this purpoſe (as you will finde in the Orders) all Officers are directed to obſerve and comply with the Committee, or any Juſtice of Peace herein, and to furniſh Meſſengers for conveyance of what ſhall be ſo certified, unleſs your ſelves or the Juſtice will otherwiſe ſend it. And this alſo I deſire may be ſpeedily imparted to each Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and made known to the Countrey.</p>

            <p>WHereas upon the Aſſignment of a quarter to any Troop or Company, the inhabitants (looking upon it as a charge, no way to be repaid, and therefore to be equally borne by all that hold any thing within the Aſſignement chargeable to a Tax) do uſe accordingly to diſtribute the Souldiers unto all, after the rate of ſuch a Tax, without regard to conveniences for quartering, whereby it happens that perſons not provided for quartering (or not for the number charged upon them) are put to hire the quartering of them at Innes or Ale-houſes, or elſe to hire the Souldiers to quarter themſelves, (the like to which is uſually done where two or more inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants are charged but with one Souldier) and that in either caſe at ſuch exceſſive rates, as the pay of the Souldier would not bear; Which courſe muſt needs bring either an unreaſonable burden upon thoſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
