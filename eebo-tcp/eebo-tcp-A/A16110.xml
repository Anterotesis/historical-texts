         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Oſt Courteous and Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
Reader, it was
not the inſatiable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
of a ſhade like fame
which ſoone vaniſheth,
nor the unquenchable
thirſt of an emptie glory, that did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure
me to write this treatiſe, but the
good will I bore thee and thine endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.
We ought to doe well, not becauſe
we would be frequently talked and ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of by every man, but that wee may
edifie and give content to our owne
mindes; for as men are inconſtant, ſo
their actions and humours likewiſe are
variable, and he that heapes up prayſes
upon thee to day may blame thee to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.
And although our name doth not
die preſently with us, if we, having done
<pb facs="tcp:172:9"/>
well in our life time be praiſe worthy, yet
it cannot laſt for ever, but muſt once
periſh with the world, and thus we die
twice.</p>
            <p>The ſubject is praiſe worthy enough,
but as for the Penman, Ile leave that
to thy deſcreet cenſure: Good language
I want, yet if I did not want it, thou
wouldſt want the underſtanding of the
booke.</p>
            <p>The Art of Defence may bee juſtly
termed next to the liberall, the chiefe,
the moſt neceſſary, as well in time of
peace as in time of warre, at home and
abroad, the moſt part of other exerciſes
of the body being but for pleaſure onely,
or the health of the body, this for plea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſure,
for health of body and ſoule
too; for if thou bee knowne to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rt
herein, and to guide thy weapon by
judgement, thou doſt ſcarſely give any
occaſion of falling out, that thou mayſt
not be accounted a vaine man, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
thou knoweſt what danger there is
in, onely ſtanding upon thine owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
<pb facs="tcp:172:9"/>
when the unskilfull having one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
courage, will quarrell upon any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,
becauſe the danger he may fall
into is unknowne to him: beſides no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
will eaſily offend thee, ſo that skill
maketh thee to be reſpected and feared,
and to feare no man, if thou be engaged
in any neceſſary quarrell.</p>
            <p>And againe, if it bee thy chance to
light into a company, where perhaps
in thy preſence ſome may fall out, then
the reputation thou art in for thy skill
may be the cauſe of their agreement, if
thou thy ſelfe doſt ſtirre in mediating
betweene them, and thus thou mayſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
their bodies and ſoules from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
in hindring the ſhedding of blood.
I cannot but marvaile extreamely, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
the neceſsitie, why this art
ſhould be ſo much neglected<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without
the want of good and skilfull teachers
be the cauſe. For with what confidence
can we weare our weapons, with what
ſafetie if we cannot uſe them? There is
a great difference betweene the wearing
<pb facs="tcp:172:10"/>
and the handling of Armes, to weare a
Rapier or Sword is onely faſhionable, to
uſe it, neceſſary.</p>
            <p>If a man bee aſſaulted and hath no
skill to truſt to, he will be daunted and
looſe his courage, and although hee doth
not looſe his ſpirit, but with a reſolute
minde will ſtrive to gaine the conqueſt,
his fortitude becomes temeritie, and his
owne valour will be his raine, becauſe it
is not ruled by reaſon.</p>
            <p>And if thou haſt never ſo good skill,
doe not offend any one, nor contemning
undervalue thine adverſaries skill, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he hath none at all, for contempt
engendreth careleſneſſe, and careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
deſtruction, ever that thou ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
thou eſcapeſt; therefore rather per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
thy ſelfe that thine adverſary
hath more skill then thou, and fight wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,
as if thou wert to combat with
thy better man, and thou ſhalt bee free
from many perills, that elſe would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
thee. It is not my profeſsion indeed
to practiſe this ſcience, or to get my li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>living
<pb facs="tcp:172:10"/>
the ſame, but my ambition to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
that to thee for <hi>Grande</hi> mercy,
which hath coſt me both thankes and
ſilver: I was encouraged by many of my

yet I had ſcarſely ventured to put
my ſelfe into the world, had it not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

and ſurround me with the fiery

thy view a booke ſmall in quantity, but
