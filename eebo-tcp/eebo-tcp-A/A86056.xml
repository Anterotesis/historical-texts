         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I confeſſe intereſſes me in
this Subject, yet I fear not to be
ſuſpected of any, becauſe I dive
only into pure Sources; and
ſcarce ſay any thing, that is
not warranted by the authority of
the Holy Ghoſt. In this work you
may behold both the power and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:170075:7"/>
wiſdom of God, in the Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Evangelical Doctrine;
and all thoſe vertues which belong
to a perfect Miniſter of the Goſpel.
I need not go about to colour,
or diſguiſe any matter herein, or
ſeek excuſes: For diſcretion marches
here with zeal, ſimplicity with
prudence, meekneſs with power
and command. The Synagogue
is here demoliſhed, Idolatry over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned,
Philoſophy confounded,
and the Croſs triumphant. Nor
is this done without great oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Infernal Spirits; for
they arm againſt one poor man,
the covetouſneſs of the Prieſts of
the Law; the pride of the Phariſes;
the envy of their Doctors; the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition
of the people; the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of Magiſtrates; the Inſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of Princes, and the malice of
falſe Brothers. In the end they
ſeem as it were victorious, having
brought Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to dye in the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:170075:7"/>
Capital City of the world. But
they are deceived in their malice.
The blood which the Apoſtle ſhed,
is the ſeed of Chriſtians, and by his
death the Church takes poſſeſſion
of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Ancient Philoſophers were
careful to write the lives of ſome
particular perſons, illuſtrious ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for their vertues, or remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
for ſome accidents of their
lives, to ſerve for a model or pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne
of imitation, by which they
might arrive to the ſame glory: much
more ought Chriſtians to endeavor
to make known thoſe Heroes of the
Church, whoſe whole actions have
been examples of ſanctity, and in
whom God would ſhew the power
of his grace, and the great won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of his mercy. For my part I
have reſolved hence-forward to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
in ſuch glorious ſubjects: I
confeſs I ought not to begin my
Apprentiſhip with the life of Saint
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:170075:8"/>
                  <hi>Paul:</hi> Yet the particular devotion, I
have for that great Apoſtle, has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
over the knowledge of my
weakneſs; and makes me hope
thoſe Readers who are reaſonable,
will excuſe the zeal of a Diſciple
for his Maſter.</p>
               <p>The Holy Ghoſt according
to the promiſe of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
was deſcended upon the
Apoſtles in the form of fiery
tongues; and had fitted them with
ſo Divine a light, and Heavenly
vigour, that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> who trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
at the voice of a Woman, in
the houſe of the High-Prieſt, did
not then fear the fury of the
Princes, Doctors, Phariſes, nor of the
people; but in the middeſt of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi>
he preached there aloud, that
Jeſus Chriſt, whom they had cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified,
was the Son of God, and
the <hi>Meſſias</hi> promiſed to their fore-fathers.
At his firſt Sermon there
were three thouſand perſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170075:8"/>
and at his ſecond, which
he made after that famous miracle
of the lame man, at the Gate of
the Temple; where he went up to
prayer with Saint <hi>John;</hi> he gained
five thouſand ſouls. Every day
the number of the faithful increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.
And the Sanctity of their
lives ſerved not a little to confirm
the Doctrine which they profeſſed.
The faith of Jeſus Chriſt united
them in ſo ſtrict a bond, that lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aſide all difference, in reſpect
of body, minde, and fortune, they
had but one heart, and one ſoul.
They heard the inſtructions of the
Apoſtles with great reſpect, and
they practiſed them with ſo much
fidelity, that no earthly conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
could change them: they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
almoſt the whole day in
prayer in the Temple, where they
met together, and where they pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
God with one mouth, and with
one heart. They aſſembled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:170075:9"/>
ſometimes in one houſe, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in another; where they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the holy Euchariſt; and
their repaſt was ever ſeaſoned with
an Evangelical frugality. Their
ſimplicity was without art, their
meekneſs without affectation, and
all their actions ſo full of great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of vertue, that the people
of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> loved them, and bare
them great reſpect. Wealth, the
origin and cauſe of quarrels and
diviſions amongſt men, was the
Chain which united that new aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation;
for Charity made all
things common amongſt them. The
rich were aſhamed to be ſo, becauſe
they believed in him that was born
and died as the pooreſt of men.
They ſold their Inheritances, and
thought themſelves very happy, if
the Apoſtles would receive the price;
which they brought and layed at
their feet to be diſtributed amongſt
the poor. <hi>Ananias</hi> and his Wife
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170075:9"/>
                  <hi>Saphira,</hi> for having concealed the
beſt part, were puniſhed with ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
death, and thinking they had
onely lyed to a man, found
they had lyed to the Holy
Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>There brake forth about that
time ſome little murmuring, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the <hi>Jews</hi> that were born out
of <hi>Judea,</hi> who to diſtinguiſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from thoſe who were born
in <hi>Jury,</hi> aſſumed the appellation of
<hi>Greeks,</hi> becauſe they ſpake <hi>Greek,</hi>
and made uſe of that language in
reading the Holy Scriptures, that is
to ſay, of the Septuagint tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Theſe complained that their
widdows, who ſerved in the daily
miniſtery were neglected, that is,
there was not care taken to aſſiſt
them in their neceſſities, and that
the publique Alms were not equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſtributed amongſt them; or
according to another opinion, that
they were not imployed in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:170075:10"/>
of Charity toward the poor,
as the widdows of the other <hi>Jews</hi>
were. The Apoſtles to prevent the
danger which that diſcontent might
cauſe, aſſembled the faithful toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and propoſed the election of
ſeven diſcreet men, unblemiſhed in
reputation, and repleniſhed with
the Holy Ghoſt, who might diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
thoſe neceſſaries to the poore;
holding it not meet for themſelves
to leave the adminiſtration of the
holy word (to which they attended
without any interruption) for this
office of charity which was of much
leſs importance. The people fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
this Counſel, and choſe <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen,
Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon,
Parmenas,</hi> and <hi>Nicholas</hi> of <hi>Antioch.</hi>
The Apoſtles, to whom they were
preſented, laied their hands upon
them and ordained them Deacons.
<hi>Stephen</hi> held the firſt place amongſt
them, for the profoundneſs of his
Doctrine, the fervency of his Zeal,

and the purity of his life. Saint <hi>Luke</hi>
in the <hi>Acts</hi> calls him <hi>a man full of
Faith, and of the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> He
was not content to diſtribute the
material bread, but he alſo brake
that of the word amongſt them,
having care to nouriſh their ſouls
as well as their bodies. His Sermons
were accompanied with miracles,
which ſerved to overthrow, what
the other had ſhaken. Every day
he ſpake in the Synagogue or
Schooles which were in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
againſt the <hi>Jews</hi> of divers Nations,
and againſt thoſe of the Synagogue
of <hi>Libertines,</hi> (which in my
opinion is to be underſtood of thoſe
who were made Slaves in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
or in ſome other war, betwixt
the <hi>Romans</hi> and the <hi>Jews;</hi> and had
received their liberty in <hi>Rome,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they were originally <hi>Jews</hi> or
<hi>Proſelites</hi> of different Nations) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the <hi>Cyrenians, Alexandrians,</hi>
thoſe of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> and the leſſer <hi>Aſia.</hi>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:170075:11"/>
Theſe diſputing againſt him, could
not reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt, who
ſpake by his Mouth; and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
they were confounded,
they would not be overcome; but
contrariwiſe, their confuſion ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
them up to animoſity; and
wanting reaſons, nor yet willing
to yeild to truth, they reſolve to
have recourſe unto calumny, ſo to
ruine him. The pretence of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
furniſhed them with an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
according to their deſire.
They publiſhed by the means of
ſome confiding and unſuſpected
perſons, that <hi>Stephen</hi> did frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
utter blaſphemy againſt the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie
of God, and the Honour of
<hi>Moſes.</hi> The accuſers affirmed to have
heard that which they reported,
whereupon the people, who ſlightly
examine things, eſpecially when it
concerns their Religion, preſently
enter into fury. The Prieſts and
Doctors inſtead of moderating, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170075:11"/>
the flame. In this heat <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi>
was hurried away, and condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by thoſe who had raiſed the
tumult, unto the Councel, where
matters of Religion were handled.
There they made him to be accuſed
by divers falſe witneſſes, that he
ſhould ſay, <hi>Jeſus of</hi> Nazareth <hi>would
deſtroy the Temple, and change the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of</hi> Moſes. All the Judges
fixt their eyes upon him, and beheld
a ſparkling Majeſtie in his face, like
to that of an Angel, without the
leaſt ſign of emotion; which was
no ſmall evidence of his innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
The High-Prieſt asked him if
he had ſpoken thoſe blaſphemies
whereof he was accuſed, and then
he anſwered after this manner.</p>
               <p>Fathers and Brethren; God who has
no need but of himſelf, to be happy; and
in whom is contained a perfect collection
of all good, at the time prefixt by his
providence for that purpoſe, appeared
to our Fore-father <hi>Abraham,</hi> whileſt
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170075:12"/>
he yet inhabited <hi>Meſopotamia;</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
him to leave his Country, and
betake himſelf to another which he
would ſhew unto him; promiſing him
in exchange a better, and more fertile
Land, a particular aſſiſtance againſt
all kinde of Enemies, and an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Bleſſing unto all Nations in his
Seed. This great Patriarch preſently
obeyed the Commandment of his Lord,
and with joy left his Country, and Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
firſt of all he dwelt in <hi>Charon</hi>
with his Father, and after his death,
he went thence to dwell in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
promiſed to him, where notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
he lived as a ſtranger, and had
not there the poſſeſſion of one handful of
Land; The accompliſhment of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
being reſerved for his poſterity.
God told him they ſhould be ill uſed, and
live under a troubleſome bondage in a
ſtrange Country, for the ſpace of four
hundred years: but in the end he would
ſet them at liberty, having firſt by a
dreadfull puniſhment afflicted thoſe,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:170075:12"/>
who had oppreſſed them. At that time
<hi>Abraham</hi> had no Son, which might
make him beleeve that Propheſie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
his poſterity. But when he leſt
expected a lawful Heir to his poſſeſſions,
in regard of his old age, and the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rennes
of <hi>Sara,</hi> he beheld himſelf the
Father of <hi>Iſaac.</hi> On the eighth day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he was born he circumciſed him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to a command received, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
alſo he had already ſatisfied in
himſelf; eſteeming it a great honour to
bear ſo glorious a mark of alliance with
his Sovereign. <hi>Iſaac</hi> begat <hi>Jacob,</hi>
and <hi>Jacob</hi> the twelve Patriarchs. <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi>
whom his Father loved particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,
was ſold by his Brethren, who
thought they had dealt favourably in
not ſacrificing him to their jealouſie,
after a more cruel manner. God, who
was his Protector, raiſed him out of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to the ſecond place of <hi>Egypt:</hi> his
unchaſt Miſtreſs, whoſe indignation he
had incurred by his continency, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity,
was the cauſe, that <hi>Pharao</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:170075:13"/>
rather his friend then Sovereign,
and made him Maſter of his Kingdom,
as well as of his Heart. In thoſe days
there was an extraordinary Famine,
which waſted the whole country of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan:</hi>
And our Fore-fathers having
no corn left in their country, were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to repair into <hi>Egypt;</hi> where by
the provident Oeconomy of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> the
Kings Granaries ſwelled in great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance.
<hi>Jacob</hi> ſent his Sons thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and in their ſecond voyage, they
knew him whom they had ſold, having
before deſigned his death. They were
much terrified, when they found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in the power of them they uſed ſo
ill. But he forgot their cruelty, and
ſhewed himſelf to remember onely that
he was their Brother. He wept with
them, and made them known to <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rao</hi>
and his whole Court, and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
them home laden with preſents,
charging them withall to bring his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Jacob</hi> to him. The good old man
ſurpriſed with theſe glad tydings, was
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:170075:13"/>
overjoyed to think he ſhould ſatisfie
his eyes before he left this world, with
the ſight of him whom he had often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayled
as dead: he went then into
<hi>Egypt,</hi> and after he had lived there
ſome years in great quiet and peace,
died in the arms of his Son <hi>Joſeph.</hi>
Our Anceſtors alſo died there, and
thoſe that deſcended of them, multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
extreamly in a few years. At laſt
the time of the Divine promiſe made to
<hi>Abraham,</hi> drawing nigh; there ſate
in the Throne of <hi>Egypt</hi> a Prince, who
had never heard the name of <hi>Joſeph,</hi>
time having made him forgotten; and
ſeeing the daily increaſe of our Nation,
after an extraordinary manner, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to apprehend, leaſt thoſe ſtrangers
ſhould render themſelves Maſters of
his country: whereupon he imployed
both craft, and violence, to work their
extirpation: To this end there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
horrid in Tyranny, which he
did not impoſe upon them. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
their labour and bad dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:170075:14"/>
they thrived ſo wel, that it ſeemed ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to contribute to their increaſe, then
ruine. Hence by an impious edict be
commanded their Midwives to ſtifle all
the Male Children of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi>
and ſave onely the Female. But this
inhumane command was not obeyed,
and God abundantly recompenced the
mercy ſhewed to thoſe innocent crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
whom a barbarous Tyrant would
have ſacrificed to his jealouſie. <hi>Moſes</hi>
was born in this wonderful perſecution;
His parents after they had concealed
him three moneths in their houſe, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
leaſt he might be diſcovered, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
him upon the River <hi>Nilus: Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rao</hi>'s
Daughter coming thither to bath
her ſelf, perceived the Cradle of Bull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſhes,
in which he floted upon the
water; ſhe ſent to take it up, and by
that means, was the inſtrument of his
preſervation. She was not ſatisfied
in exhibiting an ordinary compaſſion
towards him, but tendered him with
a Motherly care; and of an Infant
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:170075:14"/>
expoſed, ſhe adopted him Son and
Heir to a great Kingdom. His Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was anſwerable to ſo high a fortune;
and by the progreſs he made in all the
Sciences of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of his wit, his ſolid judgement,
his generous courage, his modeſt beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior,
and the greatneſs of his actions, he
ſhewed himſelf worthy of the Scepter
ordained for him. But God had other
deſigns, and would make uſe of him to
deſtroy that Empire, which he ſeemed
to be choſen out to govern. At the
age of forty yeers, God inſpired him to
viſit thoſe of his Nation in the places
where they dwelt: and there he found
an <hi>Egyptian</hi> roughly treating an <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelite,</hi>
whence a juſt reſentment tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
him to revenge the Injury done
unto his Brother, by the death of him
that abuſed him. The next day ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
two <hi>Iſraelites</hi> quarrelling together,
he ſaid to them; you are Brethren,
why injure you one another? But he that
abuſed his Companion without cauſe,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:170075:15"/>
askt him, who hath made you our Prince,
and the Judge of our differences? per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
you will kill me, as you did yeſterday
the <hi>Egyptian.</hi> That diſcourſe troubled
<hi>Moſes,</hi> and by divine providence
made him to fly into the Land of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,</hi>
where taking a Wife he begot
two Sons. He was fourſcore years of
age when in the Deſarts of <hi>Mount Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
an Angel appeared to him in the
middeſt of a flaming buſh unconſumed.
This Prodigy aſtoniſhed him, and
drawing neer to behold it at a leſs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
The Lord ſpake unto him in
theſe words: <q>
                     <hi>I am the God of thy
Fore-fathers, the God of</hi> Abraham,
<hi>the God of</hi> Iſaac, <hi>and the God of</hi>
Jacob: <hi>put of thy ſhooes, for the
earth thou treadeſt upon is holy. I
have beheld the affliction of my
captive people, &amp; their complaints
have reached my ears; I am deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to deliver them from this cruel
bondage, and upon this occaſion I
will ſend you into</hi> Egypt.</q> Fathers
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:170075:15"/>
and Brethren obſerve here, that this
<hi>Moſes</hi> whom the two <hi>Iſraelites</hi> rejected
with diſdain; ſaying, <hi>who has eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
thee Judge and Prince over
us?</hi> was the Prince and Redeemer of
the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> people, with the aſſiſtance
of that Angel which appeared to him in
the burning buſh. <hi>Egypt</hi> wondered
at the miraculous things of his Rod;
the Sea divided it ſelf to make paſſage
for the multitude he led in the Deſart;
The rock yeilded him water; for the

But this ſame <hi>Moſes,</hi> whoſe
Doctrine you accuſe me to condemn, did
not he promiſe to you him (whoſe Goſpel
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:170075:16"/>
I now preach, and whoſe name is ſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
to you) when he ſaid, <hi>God will
raiſe from the middeſt of you a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
whom you ſhall hear as you
hear me,</hi> certainly you heard him, as
our Anceſtors heard <hi>Moſes;</hi> and
whileſt <hi>Moſes</hi> was converſing with our
Lord upon the Mountain, thoſe ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
people inforced <hi>Aaron</hi> to make mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
gods, which ſhould conduct them,
not knowing (as they ſaiea) what was
become of <hi>Moſes.</hi> They adored the
Golden Calf, and gave that honour to
the work of their hands, which was
due onely to their Creator. This hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
Idolatry ſo incenſed God, that be
exterminated this great multitude by
divers puniſhments. Two only of them
that remained, beſides thoſe who were
born in the Deſarts, entered into the
Land of Promiſe, under the conduct of
<hi>Joſhua.</hi> The aſſiſtance of our Lord
ceaſed not with the death of this great
Captain: Our Anceſtours alwayes
found him favourable, ſo long as they
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:170075:16"/>
continued faithfull to his ſervice. The
divers ſervitudes they were under, ſo
long as the government remained in
the hands of Judges, were onely cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by their Idolatry, and proſtitution
to all ſorts of wickedneſs. Eaſe and
plenty corrupted thoſe, whom the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils
of Warre, and feare of Enemies
had kept within the bounds of fidelity.
They contracted unfortunate marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
with the daughters of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
and that conjugall union occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
their ſeparation from God; for
by little and little they followed the
manners of their Wives, and to make
themſelves good husbands, they were
not afraid to become wicked men.
They left the God of Heaven, for the
ſtars which he had fixed there; and
the purity of his ſacrifices, for the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
of <hi>Moloch:</hi> Their ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
was not left unpuniſhed; for our
Lord at ſeverall times rayſed Infidel
Kings againſt them, who made them
know their ſin, by the rigour they uſed
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:170075:17"/>
towards them. The yoke of the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtins
was the longeſt, and <hi>David</hi>
delivered them entirely from it.
He was the man according to
Gods heart. It was he whom God
placed in the Throne, with a ſolemn
promiſe that his Poſterity ſhould reign
for ever. This Prince, who was as
godly as valiant, deſired to build a
houſe to our Lord, that might be ſtable
and firm; for ſince they left Egypt,
they had adored him in a Tabernacle
which was portable. God accepted
his good will, but reſerved to his Son
<hi>Solomon</hi> the glory of building a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that teſtified no leſs his piety than
his magnificence. This place could not
contain him, who not onely fills all
things, but is immenſe, who has
the Heaven for his Throne, and the
Earth for his Footſtool. Princes, who
are men, may buſie and delight them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in Palaces built by the hands of
men. Our God is a Spirit, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
not in the incloſure of walls, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:170075:17"/>
the moſt magnificent works of Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture
are not worthy of his greatneſs.
It is in the hearts of men be delights
to dwell, but thoſe hearts muſt then be
innocent. They muſt be circumciſed
with a ſpiritual circumciſion, of which
that of the body is but the mark. You
have not theſe innocent hearts; but
contrarywiſe I may without injury call
them uncircumciſed, becauſe they are
tyed to earthly things, wherewith they
are repleniſh'd and poſſeſs'd with a
horrid envy and execrable rage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
our true Redeemer. You are
ſtiff-necked, and continually reſiſt the
Holy Ghoſt. In this you ſhew your
ſelves true children of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
for which of the Prophets have
not they perſecuted? Thoſe heavenly
men have all of them announced unto
you the coming of him, whom by a
black and ungrateful Treaſon you
have murthered; you who received
the Law by the miniſtery of Angels,
obſerve it not, but moſt impudently
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:170075:18"/>
break it every day. Jeſus of Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
hath been required with ſo much
the more ingratitude, as his graces
were extraordinary. It is in him that
God hath fulfilld the promiſe whereof
a little before I ſpake to you, that the
Scepter ſhould alwayes remaine in the
houſe of <hi>David.</hi> For he is deſcended
from him according to fleſh, although
you eſteemed him the Son of a poor
Carpenter. It is he alone that ſets at
liberty, not onely Iſrael, but all men
that are captive under the yoke of hell
and ſin. It is he that is deſcended
from Heaven to eſtabliſh a Coeleſtiall
Kingdome, who apprehends not the
viciſſitude of humane things, nor is
ſubject to the violence of Tyrants, and
the inconſtancy of the people. It is he
that has proved his Doctrine by mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
and ſuch as Iſrael had never
found in the Scriptures, nor ſeen in
the extent of their Provinces; and
yet his voyce could not ſoften the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of your hearts, his Miracles ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:170075:18"/>
to you to be illuſions. You have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriouſly
ſullyed the innocency of his
life. His humility made you become
inſolent. His ſufferings made you
more bitter againſt him; his patience
made you furious; and you have as
little reſpect to thoſe who ſpeak to you
in his name ſince his Reſurrection.
But you deceave your ſelves in your
deſignes. That party, which you think
to root up, ſhall be victorious. Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
ſhall triumph over Calumny.
The Church of him that is crucified,
which we announce unto you, ſhall not
deſtroy the Law, but the Law ſhall
ſerve for a foundation to the Church.
The true diſciples of <hi>Moſes</hi> will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
him in their legal obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and they will hear him as their
Maſter, according to that Oracle of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
which I alledged to you. Certainly
no man can reprove me to have ſpoken a
word that ſavours of contempt againſt
him, and the teſtimony of my accuſers
deſtroys it ſelf, neither their condition,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:170075:19"/>
nor their vertue, render them ſo credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that I need take much pains to clear
my ſelf of their calumny. They ſay I have
ſpoken againſt the Law, I deny it, and,
by my precedent diſcourſe, you may
underſtand my opinion of it; but it
is rather you that one may more juſtly
accuſe for the non-obſervance of it.</p>
               <p>The Judges and others there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
hearing ſo bold and free a
diſcourſe, and ſuch ſharp reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
from Saint <hi>Stephen,</hi> were filled
with deſpite and fury, and began
to grinde their teeth againſt this
generous Deacon, unto whom God
deſigned a more particular favour
in this encounter: For as he lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up his eyes to Heaven, (and that
his heart, filled with the Holy
Ghoſt, elevated it ſelf by ſublime
acts of a moſt pure love) he ſaw the
glory of God, which ſo tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him, as he he cryed out; <hi>I ſee
the Heavens open, and the Son of
man ſtanding on the right hand of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:170075:19"/>
God.</hi> All thoſe who heard theſe
laſt words, made a great out-cry,
and ſeized upon him. The Judges
ſtopt their eares, as if they had
heard blaſphemy, and the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
preſently hurried him away
out of the City to ſtone him. There
was no alteration in his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance;
and if any did appear, it
was rather that of joy. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
the ſtones in the hands of
thoſe Executioners, as precious
ſtones prepared for the making up
of his Crown. And thoſe that
were moſt cruel, ſeemed to him
moſt merciful. He ſuſtained this
impetuoſity ſtanding, like a Rock
that mocks at tempeſts, or rather
as a Prieſt who ſacrificeth himſelf.
In all the time of his ſuffering he
did not once complain; and
when he felt death approaching,
he ſaid, <hi>Lord Jeſu receive my ſoule.</hi>
But when he prayed for thoſe that
ſtoned him, he kneeled downe,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:170075:20"/>
knowing their offence was ſo great,
as to obtain their pardon; it was
neceſſary to joyn the humility of
his countenance to the humility of
his heart, and to uſe violence, if
it may be ſo ſaid, to the goodneſs
of God; He cryed out, <hi>O Lord let not
this ſin be imputed to them.</hi> It was to
this ſo ardent and admirable pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
that God (according to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of divers Fathers) granted
the converſion of him whoſe life
we write, and whom we will call
<hi>Soul</hi> for a time, as Saint <hi>Luke</hi> does
in the <hi>Acts.</hi> He was not of the
number of thoſe who ſtoned Saint
<hi>Stephen;</hi> yet, in looking to their
garments, he ſtoned him by their
hands, and made himſelf partaker
of their impiety.</p>
               <p>He was Couſin to the Martyr,
and they were both brought up by
<hi>Gamaliel</hi> in the ſtudy of the Law;
notwithſtanding, the falſe zeal of
Religion carried him beyond the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:170075:20"/>
Sentiment of nature, and their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip
in ſtudies. And having once
with pleaſure ſeen the bloud of
this holy Deacon ſpilt, he became
thirſty after the bloud of thoſe who
profeſſed the ſame Doctrine, and
made himſelf remarkable in that
bloudy perſecution, which was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindled
againſt them. He brake
into houſes, and thoſe he took
priſoners, were by himſelf condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
into Dungeons, after which
he ſollicited their condemnation.
In a word, he was a wild Boar in
the Vineyard of the Son of God.
After he had filled <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> with
executions, he would extend his
cruelty farther; and to that effect
demanded of the Princes &amp; Prieſts,
Commiſſions and Letters in his
favour, that he might take all thoſe
perſons in the City of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi>
who beleeved in him that was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified.
His rage afforded him not
one moment of reſt. He breathed
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:170075:21"/>
nothing but the ſlaughter and
bloud of the poor diſciples of Jeſus
Chriſt, and pleaſed himſelf one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with the thought of their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which was at hand. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
in his imagination how he
might take them all, and he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted
himſelf to uſe nothing of
mercy, either to old or young, to
whom, even the moſt barbarous
are wont to ſhew ſome compaſſion
and pitty. He was entring into
the thirty third year of his age;
and the heat of his youth, joyned
with the temper of his minde, and
zeal of Religion, eaſily tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him to reſolutions that were
extream. He was neer to <hi>Damaſco,</hi>
when an extraordinary light com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
from Heaven, and inviro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
him, he was thrown downe
to the earth, and heard a voice
that ſaid to him, <hi>Saul, Saul, why
doſt thou perſecute me?</hi> Jeſus Chriſt
was uncapable of ſuffering perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170075:21"/>
in his perſon; but he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
it in his members, that were
ſo ſtrictly united to him, as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
all injuries done unto them,
done unto his own perſon. This
perſecutor being affrighted, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
<hi>Lord, who art thou? I am
Jeſus of Nazareth whom thou doſt
perſecute,</hi> continued the voice; <hi>and
it is in vain for thee to kick againſt the
pricks.</hi> Then <hi>Saul</hi> aſtoniſhed, trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,
and, out of himſelf, cryed,
<hi>Lord what wilt thou that I doe?</hi> It
was anſwered him, <hi>Riſe up, and
goe into the City, and there I will make
known to thee what thou oughteſt to
doe.</hi> Thoſe, who accompanied him,
were wonderfully aſtoniſhed at
this conference: For they heard
the ſound of a voice, but could
not diſtinguiſh the words, nor ſaw
they any body. <hi>Saul</hi> riſing up,
found himſelf blind: The bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Heaven had exteriourly
blinded him; but his ſoul was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:170075:22"/>
from his former darkneſs;
and this glorious blinde man ſhall
appear ere long one of the bright
Stars of the Church. He enquired
not what ſhould become of him, but
made an humble Sacrifice of himſelf
to him whom but a moment before
he had perſecuted. His Converſion
was ſudden and compleat, and ſo
it ſhall continue to his death. He
was led by the hand into the
City of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> where he was
three dayes and three nights with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
eating or drinking; but not
without receiving the nouriſhment
of heavenly conſolations, and thoſe
great verities whereof he was to
be the Apoſtle. Here humane pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
is at a ſtand, that God ſhould
chooſe him a Preacher of faith,
who but a little before was ſo fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
an enemy to it. But the
wiſedome of heaven wonderfully
ſhewes it ſelf in this conduct; for
by this appears the efficacy of the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:170075:22"/>
grace of Jeſus Chriſt, which can
ſoften a heart thus hardened with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
infringing our liberty; and of
a mortal adverſary, make him his
moſt faithful &amp; couragious Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion.
He was to be the Doctor of
this new grace, neceſſary to the
ſtate of corrupted nature. He was
to heal the infirmity of the will
captivated to concupiſcence, and
rectifie the ignorance of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding:
And how could he bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
conceive the neceſſary and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
of this celeſtial remedy, then
by his own experience. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he who had ſo long time before
the heavy yoak of the Law, and
having his inclinations ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the faith of Chriſt, had yet
received it by a meanes ſo extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary,
whereby the Soule was
illuminated, and the heart ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
mollified; ſo ſtrongly, and
yet nevertheleſs ſo gently, could
not beleeve that man had the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:170075:23"/>
cheifeſt part in his own converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and that grace was not a ſlave
to the will, but rather a gentle and
amorous Miſtreſs, which prevents,
fortifies, moves, and makes the
Soule active. He was far from i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magining
there was any merit in
him, in order to his election, and
therefore he might with more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy
announce unto the <hi>Jewes,
That the works of the Law did not
render them worthy to receive the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel;</hi>
and to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> likewiſe,
<hi>If they were called, that it was out
of the meer choice, and pure good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of God.</hi> He was to labour in
the converſion of ſinners, and God
to ſhew him that he muſt deale
mildly and ſweetly with them,
made choiſe of him, even when he
was guilty of the greateſt ſin that
man could commit. Before, for
the ſame reaſon, he had eſtabliſhed
Saint <hi>Peter</hi> Head of the Church,
after he had thrice denyed him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:170075:23"/>
                  <hi>Ananias,</hi> a Prieſt of very great
piety, governed then the Infant
Church of <hi>Damaſco.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt
by apparition commanded him to
goe into the houſe of one <hi>Jude,</hi>
and told him the ſtreet, where he
ſhould finde a man named <hi>Saul,</hi>
borne at <hi>Tarſis,</hi> who was earneſt in
prayer. <hi>Ananias</hi> aſtoniſhed, took
the boldneſs to anſwer him in a
manner which ſhewed he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
to the like Viſions. <hi>Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Lord I have underſtood from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
perſons of the great harm this
man hath done to your Church; and
now he is here in this place with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions
to apprehend all thoſe who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate
thy name. Fear nothing,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
the Son of God, <hi>he is no
more a perſecutor, but a veſſel of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,
and an inſtrument by whom I
will work great wonders. I have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
him to announce my doctrine to
Nations, and to Princes, without fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the fury of one, or the power of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:170075:24"/>
the other. He ſhall preach to the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Iſrael thoſe truths which he
hath endeavoured to aboliſh; and I
will let him know what he is to ſuffer
for my name. Ananias</hi> replying no
more, went preſently and obeyed,
He found this new Convert, and
approaching to him, laid his hands
upon his head, ſaying, <hi>Saul, my
dear Brother, the Lord Jeſus, who
appeared himſelf unto you on the way
to</hi> Damaſcus, that you may ſee how
dear to him your ſalvation is, <hi>has
ſent me to you, to the end that in his
name you ſhould recover your ſight, and
be filled with the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> that you
may afterwards pour it forth upon
others, and acquit your ſelf of the
Miniſtery to which he hath ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
you. <hi>Immediatly the Scales which
covered the eyes of</hi> Saul, <hi>fell from
them, and he ſaw as he did before,
and at the ſame inſtant of this mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
he was baptized;</hi> and received
it with ſuch diſpoſition of minde,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:170075:24"/>
as we may imagine to be in one
whoſe Converſion was ſo extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,
and whom Jeſus Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
took the pains to inſtruct. For
<hi>Ananias</hi> did neither Catechiſe him,
nor ſend him to the Apoſtles to be
Catechiſed; knowing well, that
he who had drawn him out of the
darkneſs of the Law, would have
him immediately to receive from
him the Heavenly Doctrine of the
Goſpel, as being particularly his
Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>He iſſued from the water of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,
not onely pure, but full of
courage: And unwilling to loſe
one hour of time without imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it to the honour of his new Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
he began his Function, going
into the Synagogues, and there
teaching that Jeſus Chriſt was the
Son of God. His condition, his
Doctrine, the fame which was
ſpread amongſt the <hi>Jewes</hi> of his
zeal for the Law, and the deſigne
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:170075:25"/>
upon which he came to <hi>Damaſcus,</hi>
made them at the firſt to hear him
with great attention. But when
he was heard to ſpeak of Chriſt
crucified, as of the Meſſias, it was
ſtrange to ſee the aſtoniſhment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
his Audience; they could
hardly beleive their own eares.
<hi>What</hi> (ſaid they) <hi>this man who does
now announce unto us the name of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, is he not the very ſame who
not long ſince in</hi> Hieruſalem <hi>ſhewed
himſelf to be ſo cruel an enemy to it,
and perſecuted to death all thoſe who
invoked it; and the ſame that came
hither with expreſs Commiſſion to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
all thoſe who made profeſſion
of that impiety? Whence comes this ſo
ſudden a change? By what ſleight has
he been ſo quickly gained? How has he
ſo ſoon forgotten what he own to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
his Country, and his own honour?</hi>
From thence they paſſed to inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
and calumnies which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
generouſly diſdained; and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:170075:25"/>
theſe Storms made him take deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
root in the love of Jeſus Chriſt:
Every day the fire of his zeal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed;
his diſcourſe was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with ſo forcible reaſons;
he did ſo admirably expound the
Holy Scriptures; he unvailed with
ſo much clearneſs the ancient Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
which foretold our Saviour;
he ſo plainly ſhewed them, that
he whom he preached to them was
the true Meſſias; as the <hi>Jewes</hi> not
being able to anſwer his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
remained ſhamefully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded.
After he had ſtayed ſome
time with thoſe in <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> the
Holy Ghoſt, who conducted him,
put him upon the Voyage of <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia.</hi>
We know nothing of what
he did there; but we may well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that ſo ardent a zeal as his,
and ſo eminent a knowledge of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
verities, could not but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
effects worthy the Doctor of
Nations. He returned to <hi>Damaſcus,</hi>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:170075:26"/>
where he remained two years; and
during that time, he preached the
Goſpel with ſuch ſucceſs, that the
<hi>Jewes</hi> reſolved to ſeize upon him,
and to make him away. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour,
whom they had gained,
permitted them to keep the gates of
the Town guarded, that he might
not eſcape; <hi>But his diſciples let him
down from the top of the wall in a
basket.</hi> He was reſerved for other
Combats, and for other Victories;
and that which he had hitherto
done, was but a little Eſſay of
what he was to doe in eſtabliſhing,
the Law of him, who had called
him to the Apoſtleſhip of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles;</hi>
though he might well expect
to finde more cruel and powerful
enemies in <hi>Hieruſalem;</hi> yet he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore
not to goe thither to ſee Saint
<hi>Peter,</hi> and to doe him the honour
due to the firſt Apoſtle; and this,
not out of any vain curioſity, or
to receive from him the Apoſtolick
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:170075:26"/>
Miſſion, having already received
it from Jeſus Chriſt himſelf. When
he appeared amongſt the faithfull,
every one was fearful, and ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
him as a common Enemy.
<hi>Barnabas,</hi> with whom he had ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
under <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> and who was
converted before him, preſented
him to the Apoſtles, that is, to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
and <hi>James,</hi> which two he one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſaw in that Voyage. He told
them of his miraculous Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and what he had already done
at <hi>Damaſcus</hi> for defence of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.
From that time every one
looked upon him as a main work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
in the Vineyard of our Lord.
He ſtayed there but fifteen dayes,
in which ſpace he diſputed ſo effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caciouſly
againſt the <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Greece,</hi>
and the <hi>Gentils,</hi> that they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to kill him, which was the
cauſe that obliged the faithful to
conduct him to <hi>Caeſarea;</hi> from
whence he went to <hi>Tharſis,</hi> the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:170075:27"/>
place of his Birth. He fled not
from thence out of fear, or to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
danger; but humbly follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the conduct of providence. St.
<hi>Luke</hi> makes no mention of what
he did at <hi>Tharſis;</hi> and we chuſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to imitate his ſilence, then to
attribute actions to him of which
we have no proof, during the five
yeers he abode there.</p>
               <p>In the mean time thoſe were not
idle, who had left <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> by
reaſon of the Perſecution which
happened after the death of Saint
<hi>Stephen;</hi> obeying herein the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of our Saviour, who wills us,
<hi>if perſecuted in one City, to fly unto
another.</hi> For they had preached the
Faith in <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> and in the Iſle of
<hi>Cyprus,</hi> and in <hi>Antioch</hi> of <hi>Syria.</hi>
This Divine Seed abundantly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
in this laſt City, both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentils.</hi> We
are taught by a Tradition received
in the Church, that Saint <hi>Peter</hi>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:170075:27"/>
eſtabliſhed there his firſt Seat, which
he held almoſt ſeven yeers, and
then left it to lay at <hi>Rome</hi> the
Foundation of that of his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors.</p>
               <p>The newes of the good Succeſs
of the Goſpel, in a place ſo famous,
and ſo important for the Eaſt, was
brought to the Church of <hi>Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem;</hi>
whereupon, <hi>Barnabas,</hi> a
man of eminent vertue, was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched
thither to cultivate ſo ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
a Field. At his Arrival he
rejoyced to ſee ſo fair a Harveſt:
He augmented it by his Preaching,
by his Example, and by his Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles;
but judging it was needfull
to have the help of an Excellent
Labourer, he went to find out the
Apoſtle at <hi>Tharſis,</hi> and brought
him to <hi>Antioch,</hi> as to a place pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned
to his ſtrength and zeal.
The Succeſs anſwered his hopes.
There they ſtayed a whole yeere,
and during that time, the number
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:170075:28"/>
of thoſe which were converted was
found very great. It was there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
that the name of Chriſtian be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
firſt to be given to the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Jeſus Chriſt. At the ſame
time certaine Prophets arrived
there, and amongſt them, one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>Agabus,</hi> foretold a great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
which ſhould happen in the
time of <hi>Claudius</hi> the Emperor, who
Succeeded <hi>Caligula.</hi> The Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
being moved with charity, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to prevent the neceſſity of
their Brethren in <hi>Judea;</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
gotten what Alms they could,
delivered it into the hands of our
Apoſtle and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> to carry ſafe
unto thoſe for whom it was gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
This occaſioned them to make
a Voyage to <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> where
<hi>Herod</hi> endeavoured to make fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
his entry by the death of St.
<hi>Peter.</hi> But to underſtand this bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
tis neceſſary we take the
courſe of this Story a little higher.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:170075:28"/>
The Emperor <hi>Tiberius</hi> ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Auguſtus,</hi> made his Reign no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious,
by all the cruelties which
may enter into the Soules of the
greateſt Tyrants. No condition
was ſecure from his jealouſies a
<hi>Rome</hi> loſt her moſt noble and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Citizens by the impudency
of Accuſers, who permitted inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
to be no where ſafe. The
Noble <hi>Germanicus</hi> was his Victime
in the Eaſt; <hi>Agrippina</hi> his wife
ſurvived him, but to end her days
by as cruel a death: Their Sons,
<hi>Druſus</hi> and <hi>Nero,</hi> were treated in
the ſame manner by that <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
with whom, reaſon of State,
which opens a paſſage to all the
crimes of Tyrants, had more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
then all the Lawes of nature. In
fine, he was the Executioner of all
his Friends. The obſcureſt corner
in the Iſle of <hi>Caprea</hi> could not ſo
conceal his bruitiſh impurities, but
that the memory of them has
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:170075:29"/>
reached even our Age; and their
recital would be too horrid to find
any place in this Hiſtory. Whileſt
fear ſilenced all the World, the
divine vengeance, which had for
the ſpace of two and twenty years
made uſe of him to puniſh the ſins
of <hi>Rome,</hi> hurryed him out of this
World to a puniſhment due to his
crimes; and, by his death, the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
was delivered from a moſt
dreadful Monſter.</p>
               <p>Six moneths before, <hi>Agrippa,</hi>
Grand-child to <hi>Herod</hi> the Elder,
was caſt into priſon for wiſhing the
Empire unto <hi>Caligula,</hi> who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
magnificently requited his
affection; for no ſooner had he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
unto it, but he ſet him at
liberty, and gave him a chain of
gold of equal weight with that of
iron, wherewith he had been load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
for his ſake. To this he added
the gift of thoſe Provinces which
his Uncle <hi>Philip,</hi> who dyed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:170075:29"/>
out Children, poſſeſs'd, and gave
him leave to take the Title of King
upon him. This dignity begot a
jealouſie in <hi>Herod Antipas,</hi> who
was the murtherer of Saint <hi>John
Baptiſt. Herodias,</hi> who had ſet him
on to commit that crime, perſwaded
him to goe to <hi>Rome,</hi> and court the
Emperor, thereby to purchaſe that
Crown to himſelf, which with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
ſhe beheld upon the head of his
Brother. But at his Arrival, he
found the Emperor ſo ſtrongly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs'd
againſt him, by reaſon of
the great proviſions of war which
he had made, and for the which he
could give no account, that he ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced
him unto Baniſhment, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the inceſtuous compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of his bed, who would not
leave him in his declining fortune.
<hi>Lyons</hi> was the place of their Exile,
and the witneſs of their miſerable,
but juſt death, ſince it revenged
that of the Precurſer of Jeſus
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:170075:30"/>
Chriſt. <hi>Caligula</hi> alſo ſoon felt the
juſtice of God irritated by his cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties.
Never was there beaſt more
ſavage, and leſs capable of being
made tame. His neereſt Friends
could not ſave themſelves from his
hands: In his indignation he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
neither Dignity, nor Age:
All condemned perſons he reſerved
to be the food of his wilde
beaſts which he kept for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
becauſe the fleſh of other
creatures would coſt too much. He
alſo ſet upon thoſe which were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
with the like brutality. By
his command ſome were branded
on the Fore-head, others condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to the Mines; Theſe he ſhut up
in Cages of iron, others he cauſed
to be ſevered in two by the middle
with a Sawe. He made Fathers to
be preſent at the Execution of their
Children, and ſent Litters to fetch
thoſe who excuſed themſelves by
reaſon of their indiſpoſition. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:170075:30"/>
that, he invited them many
times to Feaſts and Comedies, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
them to ſhew ſigns of joy. At
one time he maſſacred all that were
baniſhed, imagining they prayed
to God for his death. He was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
againſt the felicity of his Age,
eſteeming that of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> more
happy, in which the Legions of
<hi>Varrus</hi> were loſt; and envying that
of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> memorable in his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
for the fall of the Theatre,
which cruſhed to death twenty
thouſand perſons. All theſe were
ralleries rather of a Monſter then
a Man. The Books of his Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
were reduced unto two memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials;
the one was called his ſword,
the other his dagger; and the rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of his Cloſet were ſeveral ſorts
of poyſon. His Succeſſor cauſed
them to be caſt into the Sea, and
their malignity was ſuch, as it kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
multitudes of Fiſhes. In fine,
his madneſs came to that height, as
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:170075:31"/>
he would be adored for a God; he
made the Figure of his head to be
ſet upon the troncks of the Idols
of <hi>Jupiter Olimpius.</hi> He placed
himſelf betwixt the Statues of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor</hi>
and <hi>Pollux,</hi> to receive adoration
from thoſe who entred the Court.
In the Temple which bare his
name, the Sacrifices were Peacocks,
Pheaſants, and ſuch like extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Fowl. He knew, that amongſt
all the people of the world, the
<hi>Jewes</hi> have a horrour to worſhip
their Ancient Gods, and would
with greater reaſon refuſe to yeild
him divine honour in his life-time;
this increaſed a paſſion in him to
have his Statue ſet up in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Hieruſalem.</hi> He wrote to
<hi>Petronius,</hi> Governour of <hi>Judaea,</hi> in
a ſtile that well ſhewed he would
be obeyed. The <hi>Jewes</hi> hearing the
newes, were touched with ſuch ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
as cannot be expreſſed. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronius</hi>
knowing their humour, and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:170075:31"/>
fearing (as he had cauſe) a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
revolt, judged it beſt to defer
the Execution of this wicked com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand:
And to furniſh himſelf with
a fair pretext, he ſummoned from
the neighbouring Provinces Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
injoyning them to labour
with all poſſible care in making a
Statue which might be worthy to
repreſent an Emperor, and fit for
the place where it was to ſtand. He
wrote a Letter to <hi>Caligula,</hi> in
which he handſomly excuſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
that he had not as yet put in
execution his orders. But the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
well perceived he had more
regard to the Prayers and Religion
of the Jewes, then to fulfill his
will. Notwithſtanding he diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
his wrath in the anſwer he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
him, and yeilded to the
prayers and grief of <hi>Agrippa,</hi> whom
he loved ſo far, as he agreed to let
alone the conſecration of his Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
But being very inconſtant in
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:170075:32"/>
his deſignes, he ſoon repented the
favour he had ſhewed, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
that a Statue ſhould be
made at <hi>Rome,</hi> of braſs gilded o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
intending to ſend it to <hi>Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi>
and place it in the Temple
before the noiſe of it ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed
amongſt the Jewes; but
death hindered the courſe of this
execrable deſign. He that had wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the people of <hi>Rome</hi> had but one
head, was killed by <hi>Chereas</hi> and
<hi>Sabinus,</hi> Captains of his Guard,
after the Reign, or rather, after the
Tyranny of three years, and ſome
moneths. <hi>Claudius</hi> his Uncle, and
Brother to <hi>Germanicus,</hi> ſucceeded
in the Empire, at the Age of fifty
years. At his firſt entrance he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
to <hi>Herod Agrippa</hi> the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
which his Predeceſſor had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him, and reſtored to him the
Provinces of <hi>Judaea,</hi> and <hi>Samaria,</hi>
as having heretofore belonged to
the Demain of <hi>Herod</hi> his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:170075:32"/>
This was not ſufficient to
ſatisfie his Liberality, he added to
it the Country which <hi>Lyſanius</hi>
held. In ſtead of receiving ſo great
benefits from the hands of God,
and to lay the Foundation upon
his protection, for the glory and
repoſe of his new Kingdome, he
ſuffered himſelf to be blinded with
his Greatneſs, and followed the
Maximes of the unhappy Polititi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
who perſwades Princes that
crimes are to be permitted, when
profitable. It was upon this ground
that preſently after his Arrival at
<hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> to gain the good will
of the Jewes, he cauſed the head
of Saint <hi>James,</hi> Brother to Saint
<hi>John,</hi> to be cut off; a man even to
his Enemies venerable for his pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
To this death he would have
added alſo that of Saint <hi>Peter;</hi> but
to obſerve a form of Juſtice, he
made him to be bound with two
chains, and ſhut up in an obſcure
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:170075:33"/>
priſon, with intention after the
Feaſt of <hi>Eaſter</hi> to pleaſe the people
with the Spectacle of his Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
This accident aſtoniſhed the
Church, now in her Infancy, and
moved her to ordain continuall
and publick prayers, conceaving
the ſtorm which then threatned, to
be of higheſt danger. Her mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
careful for the preſervation of
their Head, prayed night and day
for the obtaining of his life and
liberty, both which were deſperate
according to humane probability.
But Almighty God carefully preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
him, to make him inſtrumental
unto greater things then which he
had already done. The night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that day which was ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for his appearance before the
people, an Angel deſcended from
Heaven into the priſon where he
was, and found him betwixt two
Souldiers of his guard oppreſſed
with ſleep. The Dungeon was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:170075:33"/>
filled with a great light, and
awaking him by a touch on the
ſide, at his command to follow
him, the chains fell from his hands.
He obeyed, and paſſing the firſt and
ſecond watch, came to the iron
gate that led to the ſtreet, which
of it ſelf alſo opened. After he
had gone ſome few ſteps, this Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger
of Heaven vaniſhed, and the
priſoner, who till then thought he
was in a dream, found indeed that
he was delivered out of the hands
of <hi>Herod,</hi> and from the fury of the
<hi>Jewes.</hi> He came and knockt at the
door of <hi>Mary</hi> the Mother of <hi>John,</hi>
ſirnamed <hi>Mark,</hi> where many faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
were gathered together, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for his delivery. A young Maid
named <hi>Rhodes,</hi> knew him by his
voice, and preſently went up to
tell the Aſſembly; ſome told her
ſhe was mad; but ſhe affirming
that it was certainly he, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
tis his Angel, meaning him
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:170075:34"/>
whom we call our Angel Guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
and who is given to every one
of us. When the door was open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and that they ſaw him, they
could yet ſcarce beleive their own
eyes. He recounted to them what
had happened in the priſon: And
giving order to make known this
good newes to <hi>James</hi> the Brother
of our Lord, who was Biſhop of
<hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and to the reſt of the
Faithfull, he departed towards
the Coaſt of <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> there to
preach the Goſpel. From thence
he went to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he began
to make war againſt Idolatry, and
to eſtabliſh the Seat of his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors,
which might be through all
Ages of the Church the Center of
Eccleſiaſtical Unity. <hi>Herod</hi> adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed
of his delivery, grew inra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
aſtainſt the Souldiers to whoſe
cuſtody he was committed. He
cauſed diligent ſearch to be made
after him, but in vain; and the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:170075:34"/>
Divine Vengeance not long after
failed not to puniſh <hi>Herod</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
For he being at <hi>Ceſarea,</hi> the
Inhabitants of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sydon,</hi> with
whom he was angry (the cauſe is
not mentioned in the Hiſtory of
the <hi>Acts)</hi> ſent Deputies to him to
make their peace. He gave them
publick audience; and to render this
action more ſolemn, would appear
adorn'd in all the Royal ornaments
of Majeſty. At his Entry the flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
people clapt their hands;
and when he ſpake, they cryed,
<hi>Tis a God that ſpeakes, and not a
man.</hi> This unfortunate Prince
took pleaſure in this Sacrilegious
Adulation, and with joy received
the honour which is onely due to
the King of Kings. But at the
ſame time the Angel of our Lord
ſtrook him with a horrible diſeaſe,
that from his Throne he was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to his Bed, where the worms
eating his fleſh, made it appear that
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:170075:35"/>
it was the fleſh of a mortall man;
and that God is more elevated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
Sovereigns, then Sovereigns
are above their ſubjects, that by
the leaſt of creatures he knowes
how to abate the pride of the moſt
formidable Tyrants; and that pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and juſtice are the moſt ſolid Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of an Empire.</p>
               <p>The perſecution of this wicked
man gave occaſion to the Apoſtles
to leave <hi>Judaea,</hi> and divide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into all parts of the world;
for till then they had reſided in
<hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Before they ſeparated
themſelves, they compoſed a Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
of Chriſtian Doctrine, which
is called the Apoſtles Creed; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were that every one made
an Article, or becauſe it was the
mark, or as it were, the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word
whereby Chriſtians might
know one another, as being ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
of one Band. Saint <hi>Matthew</hi>
wrote alſo before this ſeparation
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:170075:35"/>
the Goſpel which bears his name,
and of which St. <hi>Hierome</hi> ſayes he
ſaw the Original in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> in the
Library of <hi>Pamphilius</hi> the Martyr.
Saint <hi>Bartholomew</hi> going into the
<hi>Indies</hi> tranſcribed it with his own
hand, and it was found in the time
of <hi>Zeno</hi> the Emperor, with the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of Saint <hi>Barnaby.</hi> In the mean
time the Apoſtle returned to <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och</hi>
with <hi>Barnaby,</hi> and another
companion called <hi>John,</hi> ſirnamed
<hi>Mark.</hi> Their return cauſed great
joy to that Church, but ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
not long their preſence, for
the Prophets and Doctors of which
that Church was compoſed, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
whom was <hi>Simon</hi> ſirnamed
the Black, <hi>Lucius</hi> the <hi>Cyrenian,</hi> and
<hi>Manahem,</hi> Foſter-Brother to <hi>Herod,</hi>
the <hi>Greek</hi> word ſignifies brought up
with him. Whileſt they faſted, and
were buſied in the Miniſtery of our
Lord, they received command from
the Holy Ghoſt to ſeparate from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:170075:36"/>
all the reſt <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas.</hi>
Saint <hi>Luke</hi> places them in the
rank of Doctors, for the work un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
which he had deſigned them.
They preſently obeying, impoſed
hands upon them after faſting and
prayer.</p>
               <p>There is a great diverſity of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
amongſt Interpreters, in
Explicating what the Impoſition
of hands ſignifies in this paſſage of
the <hi>Acts,</hi> and what was the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
in which thoſe here named
were imployed. The word of the
Liturgy, according to ſome, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
the celebrating of the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of the Maſs. Saint <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>
Explicates it of Preaching. Others
of any kinde of Eccleſiaſtical Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
By impoſition of hands di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
modern Interpreters under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
Ordination to Epiſcopacy.
Their ground is upon this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the Liturgy, becauſe the
Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> did always ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:170075:36"/>
this action with faſting
and prayer. But although the
Church doe at this day celebrate
Ordinations with theſe Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
it is not therefore to be ſaid
they were practiſed from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning;
nor, that every time they
were practiſed, it was for Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
They add alſo, that there
is no other paſſage in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament
which ſhewes St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and
St. <hi>Barnabas</hi> to be conſecrated ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Prieſts or Biſhops. One might
anſwer, that the Apoſtleſhip con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
theſe two Orders by that
power which is called <hi>per Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentiam;</hi>
for the Apoſtles were to
found particular Churches which
compoſed the Univerſal. Now
thoſe could not be founded with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Biſhops, the Church being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
to be a people joyned to their
Biſhop. They ought therefore to
have that Character which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for the Ordination of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops.
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:170075:37"/>
Certainly it connot be
ſhewed in the Goſpel, that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Apoſtles ſent by Jeſus Chriſt,
were firſt made Biſhops, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Apoſtles; nor is there any
likelyhood that the Apoſtleſhip of
Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who (as St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi>
and St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſay) was not called
by Jeſus Chriſt mortal, but by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt totally God, that is to
ſay, living by a divine life after
his Reſurrection) did not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe
the excellency which the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
had, and was leſs extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary.
Saint <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> whoſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
is of great weight in what
concernes the Doctor of Nations,
ſayes that he was ordained Apoſtle
in the time we ſpeak of. This o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
may be grounded upon
this, that Saint <hi>Luke</hi> in this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
ranks him amongſt the other
Doctors of the Church of <hi>Antioch.</hi>
Whence 'tis probable, if he had
been conſidered as an Apoſtle, and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:170075:37"/>
an Apoſtle of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> by emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency,
or if he had exerciſed that
Function, he would not have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him a Title much inferiour to
the Apoſtleſhip: For Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
ſpeaking of the Orders of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of the Church, ſayes, that
God has eſtabliſhed firſt the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
ſecondly the Prophets, and
in the third place the Doctors. And
truly before this time Saint <hi>Luke</hi>
relates no other Function of his
then thoſe of a Doctor and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
But to this may be objected,
that S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays cleerly he is no A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
of men, nor by men, but Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
of Jeſus Chriſt, &amp; by Jeſus Chriſt.
How then can his Apoſtleſhip be
immediatly from our Lord, if the
Prophets and Doctors of the
Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> ordained him A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle?
He is ſo far from having any
advantage over the other Apoſtles
by his Vocation, that it is much
inferiour to theirs; they having
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:170075:38"/>
been ſent immediately by Jeſus
Chriſt, and he having received his
Miſſion, 'tis true, of Jeſus Chriſt,
but by way of Inſpiration. and by
the Miniſtery of thoſe, who them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
were neither Biſhops nor A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
but ſimply Prophets and
Doctors. Certainly to me this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
ſeems unanſwerable, unleſs
we allow that by Ordination to
the Apoſtleſhip, and impoſition of
hands, Saint <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> means that
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was elevated to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtleſhip
of Jeſus Chriſt from the
very moment of his converſion,
but did not exerciſe the Functions
of it towards the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> (for
whom he had particularly receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it) until the Holy Ghoſt made
it known unto him by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
and Doctors of the Church
of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and that it was then
time to begin the exerciſe of his
Function; ſo that the impoſition
of hands upon him was but a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:170075:38"/>
invocation of the Divine aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
for him, accompanied with
the divine ſacrifice, with prayer,
and with faſting, to the end God
would daign to beſtow upon him
all benedictions neceſſary for the
imployment to which he was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained.
Although we might draw
from this paſſage a ſtrong Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for the Ordination of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
yet I chuſe rather to paſs
it over, then ground the proof of
an undoubted verity upon a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
that admits diſpute; as if we
had no other arms to defend our
ſelves, and ſought more to heap
together, then ſelect Arguments.
My deſigne is to write a Hiſtory
clear and plain, and not a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
controverſie. Hence I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
mine and others opinions, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
afterwards unto Readers
the liberty of making their own
choice.</p>
               <p>At this ſame time the Apoſtle
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:170075:39"/>
was elevated unto the third Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
where he learnt ſecrets which
are neither poſſible nor fit to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
to man in this life. I know
Interpreters agree not in this; but
ſince it is a difficulty onely in
Chronology, and not of much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
I embrace that opinion
as moſt conformable to truth,
which correſponds with the date
aſſigned by the Apoſtle himſelf in
his ſecond Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
where he ſayes <hi>he knew a man
that was rapt into the third Heaven
fourteen years ſince.</hi> Beſides, I have
Authors very famous, and very
conſiderable for my opinion; and
certainly, if in theſe queſtions of
fact, reaſon may be admitted, this
Revelation could not be given to
him in a more neceſſary time then
that which we <hi>deſigne.</hi> For then
he was to make war with all his
force againſt Idolatry. It was then
that Jeſus Chriſt imbarqued him
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:170075:39"/>
upon that great Sea of Nations, to
blazon amongſt them the ſound of
the Goſpel, and to work wonders
by means of his ſingular Apoſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
conferred upon him. Now
to announce thoſe ſublime veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
it was neceſſary he ſhould firſt
taſte them at the Spring-head,
and be himſelf repleniſhed, ere
he communicated them to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>But there is yet a notable diſpute
betwixt both modern and ancient
Interpreters, about this rapture,
and this viſion. Some will have
it, that he ſaw in this extaſie the
diſtinction of the Orders of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
whereof he ſpeaks in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle;
nor finde we any other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical
Writer to diſtinguiſh them
as he has done. Others ſay that
he did there know particularly
the profund Myſtery of the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
and the vocation of <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils</hi>
to faith; for in his Epiſtle to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:170075:40"/>
the <hi>Epheſians</hi> he ſayes; <hi>That to him
who is the leaſt amongſt the faithfull,
charge was given to make known to
the Gentils the ineſtimable riches of
Jeſus Chriſt, and to illuminate all
men, teaching them the diſpenſation
of the Miſtery hidden in God from
all Ages, to the end that the Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
and coeleſtial powers ſhould
learn of the Church the different wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God.</hi> In effect the proper
Miniſtery of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was this
vocation of the <hi>Gentils,</hi> and their
incorporation with Jeſus Chriſt.
That was his charge; in this he
was diſtinguiſhed from the reſt of
the Apoſtles; all his Epiſtle am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
treat of this vocation, which
ſurpriſed and offended the <hi>Jewes.</hi>
This makes Saint <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſay,
<hi>That the Apoſtle illuminated the Arch-Angels,
the Principalities, the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and the Angels.</hi> But I cannot
beleeve that this ſole myſtery was
the bounds of the Revelation of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:170075:40"/>
Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> unleſs it may be ſaid it
comprehends in it all the other
myſteries of Chriſtian Religion.
Some Doctors, amongſt whom St.
<hi>Thomas,</hi> have held that he ſaw the
Divine Eſſence with a momentary
glance, and as it were in paſſing;
and doe they think to evade that
maxime of ſcripture, <hi>That no man
ſhall ſee God, and live?</hi> however I
cannot be of that opinion, and it
ſeems to me not to be maintained.
I will give place to none in my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
and affection towards him
whoſe life I write; but yet me
thinks reſpect and affection to
Saints ought to be ſquared by the
verity which is manifeſted to us,
and not by the ſubtilty of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
or by certain congruities more
ingenious then ſolid. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
would not unfold to us the
manner of his Extaſie; whether
it was a ſeparation of the ſoul from
the body, or a ſuſpenſion of the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:170075:41"/>
vital functions of the ſoul within
the body, during which he ſaw
thoſe divine verities, whether this
ſight was imaginary, or intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
and how long it laſted: It ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
him to tell us that he heard
ſecret words, which are not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for man to repeat; that is to
ſay, he ſaw ineffable Myſteries,
which cannot be explicated by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
words, nor were it to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to make them known, ſince
men are not capable of them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
it would not at all conduce to
the ſalvation of thoſe unto whom
he was to preach. This reſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhewes his humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and that he ſpake not of his
Extaſies, unleſs in a manner com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled,
which we ſhall explicate in
another place of this Hiſtory. It
may alſo repreſs the curioſity of
Readers, and of thoſe who bear
moſt honour and affection to him,
and hinder them from penetrating
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:170075:41"/>
into that Abyſs which his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty
would hide. Tis now time
to return to the courſe of our Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> departed from
<hi>Antioch</hi> of <hi>Syria</hi> immediatly after
they had received that impoſition
of hands, which has occaſioned
this digreſſion. The firſt place they
came unto, was <hi>Seleucia,</hi> which
was not above fourteen miles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant.
From thence they went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Iſle of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> famous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the <hi>Pagans</hi> for the birth of
<hi>Venus,</hi> who was the Goddeſs of
pleaſure, and the Mother of Love;
but it was truly famous amongſt
the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> for the birth of St.
<hi>Barnaby,</hi> and many other great
men which ſhe gave unto the
Church. In <hi>Salamina,</hi> ſince cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Conſtantia,</hi> they preached to
the <hi>Jewes;</hi> and continuing their
Voyage, came to <hi>Paphos,</hi> where
God prepared for the Apoſtle a
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:170075:42"/>
moſt important Victory. <hi>Sergius
Paulus</hi> the Proconſul, a man ſtiled
in the <hi>Acts</hi> with the Title of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
deſired to hear him whoſe
reputation was ſo great in the
Country. There was a <hi>Jew</hi> called
<hi>Elimas,</hi> who counterfeited him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to be a Prophet, but was an
abominable Magician: This man
oppoſed the doctrine of <hi>St. Paul,</hi>
whereat he juſtly offended, and in
a tone full of authority, ſpake in
this manner. <hi>O thou childe of the
Devil, thou man full of malice and
deceit, wilt thou never leave to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the deſignes of God, and pervert
his wayes. Thou doeſt endeavour to
hinder the Proconſul from receiving
the light of the Goſpel, but for a juſt
puniſhment thou ſhalt loſe the light of
the Sun, and for a time remaine
blinde.</hi> The effect preſently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
his words, and thick ſcales
covered the eyes of this wicked
man, who having feigned himſelf
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:170075:42"/>
to be a God, ſtood in need of a
guide to conduct him. Yet this
puniſhment altered him not, for
he continued in his impiety, and
afterwards compoſed a book a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> However his
blindneſs gave light to the Procon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul,
and finiſhed his converſion. He
received with joy and admiration
that verity which he ſaw ſo mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly
confirmed, and afterwards
became a zealous preacher of it.
The Church of <hi>Narbone</hi> glories to
have had him for her firſt Biſhop;
and the <hi>Roman</hi> Martyrologe cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brates
his memory on the 22. of
<hi>March;</hi> but that is a diſpute which
I leave to Chronologers. In this
place Saint <hi>Luke</hi> begins to give the
name of <hi>Paul</hi> to the Apoſtle; and
from thence ſome have drawne an
argument, in their opinion very
ſtrong, that till then he was called
<hi>Saul;</hi> and that after this great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,
he took the name of his
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:170075:43"/>
                  <hi>Cathecumen,</hi> as the Ancient <hi>Romans</hi>
did of thoſe people they ſubdued
by their Arms. But this is repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to the humility of a man who
ſayes of himſelf that he was not
worthy to be called an Apoſtle. It
is more likely that the Proconſul,
in acknowledgement of the good
which he had received from him,
deſired him to take his name, which
was one of the nobleſt of Ancient
<hi>Rome;</hi> and that he accepted of it
not out of vanity, but becauſe it
might gaine him a better admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
amongſt the <hi>Gentils,</hi> to whom
he was particularly to preach.
Some ſay, that perhaps he received
both thoſe names at his circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
that the one was better known
before his own converſion, and the
other more uſed after, this which we
now relate. I ſhould be of opinion
he had both thoſe names, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the <hi>Jews</hi> he was called <hi>Saul,</hi>
and at <hi>Tharſis,</hi> which was a <hi>Roman</hi>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:170075:43"/>
Colony, he took the name of <hi>Paul,</hi>
it being a <hi>Roman</hi> name. This diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
is of no great importance,
and we ſpeak of it onely by the
way.</p>
               <p>After the Proconſul's Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
his Family being alſo conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and many others, the Apoſtle
departed, to ſow the Seed of the
Goſpel (which had ſo happily
proſpered in <hi>Cyprus)</hi> in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
He did but paſs by <hi>Pergen</hi> of
<hi>Pamphilia,</hi> judging that there was
a greater harveſt to be made in <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch</hi>
of <hi>Piſidia.</hi> On a Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
he went into the Synagogue,
and mingled himſelf with the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtants
to hear the Lecture which
was made there out of the Holy
Scriptures. When that was done,
the chief of the Aſſembly being
willing to honour him, according
to the cuſtome of the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſent to
him and to <hi>Barnaby,</hi> to know if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them would ſpeak. Then
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:170075:44"/>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> roſe up, and making a ſigne
with his hand, inviting ſilence,
began in this manner.</p>
               <p>The Diſcourſe I have to make unto
you, Men, Iſraelites, and all you who
have the fear of our Lord, is of ſo
great importance, as I muſt beg an
extraordinary attention. You know
that God, who owns to be his all the
Nations of the World, choſe through
an admirable effect of his goodneſs the
Poſterity of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> to
be unto him a particular people, and
a beloved Nation. Whileſt our Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors
were captives in <hi>Egypt,</hi> he took
pity of their afflictions, and delivered
them by miracles worthy the ſtrength
of his Arme. He opened to them the
boſome of the Sea, and for the ſpace of
forty years fed them in the deſart, and
with incredible patience ſuffered their
revolts and murmurs. He brought
their Children into the Land of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
the which he diſtributed amongſt
them, after he had extirpated ſeven
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:170075:44"/>
Nations for their ſakes. He governed
them by Judges till the time of <hi>Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el.</hi>
This government not pleaſing
them, he accommodated himſelfe to
their Ingratitude, and choſe for their
King <hi>Saul</hi> the Son of <hi>Cis,</hi> of the Tribe
of <hi>Benjamin.</hi> But he not anſwering
to the favours received from God, by
his diſobedience to <hi>Samuels</hi> command,
by his attempt to offer ſacrifice to the
Lord, and by his other wicked actions,
occaſion was given to reprove him, and
elect <hi>David,</hi> of whom God himſelf has
vouchſafed to give this teſtimony: <hi>I
have found</hi> David <hi>the Son of</hi> Jeſſe,
<hi>a man according to my own heart,
who will doe all my commands.</hi>
From his Poſterity that Jeſus Chriſt
the Saviour of Iſrael is deſcended, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the promiſe made to our
Fore-fathers. <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
his comming, preaching to all
people the Baptiſme of pennance. His
Sanctity and Doctrin made men doubt
if he were not the Meſſias. But inſtead
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:170075:45"/>
of attributing that honour to himſelf,
he told all his Auditors that he was
not the Meſſias, but onely his humble
Precurſor; and that he held himſelfe
not worthy to unty his ſhooes. My
dear Brethren, holy Poſterity of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
tis for you that he is come. Tis un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thoſe who amongſt you have the fear
of God, that theſe tidings of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
are directed. The Lawe given to
<hi>Moſes</hi> upon the Mountaine is holy, no
doubt, ſince the Author of it is holy:
But that onely exhorts men to Sanctity,
and cannot give it by any peculiar ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy
of its owne nature. It forbids
our conſent to the motions of concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence,
but does not furniſh us with
force to withſtand thoſe furious aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults.
Concupiſcence is a Monſter
too ſtrong for it, a poyſon which ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes
all its remedies, a yoak of death,
which the Law alone cannot break.
Our Fathers have groned under the
weight, and have found it as difficult
as ſhameful: Notwithſtanding it was
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:170075:45"/>
good, and even neceſſary that our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſhould remaine long under this
captivity, to the end men acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
their incapacity of obſerving the
precepts of the Lawe, and the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the Law in it ſelfe, might have
recourſe to that Phyſitian and Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
who is able to cure all their evils,
and free them from their ſervitude. This
Phyſitian, this Redeemer is Ieſus Chriſt
which I announce unto you, it is he who
offers unto you the perfect liberty of
the Children of God. Will you become
enemies to your own good fortune? Will
you imitate the ingratitude of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of <hi>Hieruſalem?</hi> The envy
of the Princes, of the Prieſts, and the
fury of the Sinagogue? Who inſtead
of receiving him as the perſon promiſed
by all the Prophets, inſtead of acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging,
that in him were fulfilled al the
propheſies, which are read every Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both
in their Aſſemblies; without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
any occaſion of complaint againſt
him, or any ſhadow of accuſation in the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170075:46"/>
leaſt offence, ſuffered themſelves to
be carried away with ſo much ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
and fury, and with ſuch exceſs
of blindeneſſe, as to urge <hi>Pilate</hi> to
put him to death: and after the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners
had (without reflection) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately
performed whatever the
Scriptures foretold of him, by faſtning
him to an infamous piece of wood, peer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
his hands and feet, caſting lots
upon his garment, giving him gaul
and vinegar to drink, they took him
from the Croſſe, and put him into a
Monument, but God left him not there
long. The third day he raiſed him
again, and many days after he ſhewed
himſelfe to thoſe, who from <hi>Galilee</hi>
went up with him to <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and
who at this time declare as much to
the people, as having been eye witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
thereof. We preach unto you the
ſame verity, which ought not to ſeem
a novelty unto you, ſince in the ſecond
Pſalme, the Pſalmiſt beholding in
Spirit the life, which the Eternal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:170075:46"/>
was to give to his Son Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
in the Tombe, for exchange of that
which he had Sacrificed to his Sanctity
and Juſtice upon the Tree of the Croſs,
introduces him ſpeaking in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
unto the Meſſias. <hi>Thou art my
Son, this day I have begotten thee.</hi>
He explicates the wonderful change,
that the Reſurrection made in Jeſus
Chriſt, by this word of Generation;
as the moſt proper to make known the
greatneſs and perfections of that new
Condition, where no thing remaines
in him of the old <hi>Adam,</hi> being now
perfectly a new man. This ſtate is no
leſs durable, then glorious for Jeſus
Chriſt, having once dyed, he dyes no
more. He ſhall never return to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
as the ſame Pſalmiſt foretold
by theſe words. <hi>Thou wilt not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
that thy Holy One ſee cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</hi>
Now it is evident this
could not be ſaid of <hi>David.</hi> For that
Monarch, after he had happily go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
his Subjects, and remained
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:170075:47"/>
faithfull to the commands of God,
is dead, and he ſleeps yet in the
grave amongſt his Fore-Fathers.
Tis of Jeſus Chriſt he intended to
ſpeak, of Ieſus that is no more ſubject
to corruption, after that God had rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
him again. You muſt know that
it is by him alone remiſſion of ſinnes is
given, nor is it to be found in the Law
of <hi>Moſes.</hi> The bloud of Goats and
Bulls, was but a figure of that which
he ſpilt, to take away all the iniquities
of the World. But now verity drives
away figures, and the light darkneſs.
We now announce no more unto you a
Legal juſtice, but a Chriſtian juſtice;
an interiour juſtice, a juſtice before
God, a juſtice which glorifies God,
and not man, who poſſeſſes it; becauſe
it comes from God, who infuſes it into
man, by vertue of his Spirit. If the
Law could have given true juſtice;
Ieſus Chriſt had dyed in vain. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
think no more of eſtabliſhing your
juſtice, by a proud opinion of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:170075:47"/>
of your works, as if they were holy,
or that their Sanctity proceeded from
you, or from the Law. Your actions
may have the appearance of goodneſs,
as done in exteriour obedience to the
precepts of the Law: you may practiſe
that which it ordains, and abſtain
from that which it forbids, and living
after this manner, you are juſt in the
ſight of men, and you deſerve to receive
praiſe from them; But God does not
judge according to appearance, he
regards not ſimply the action which is
done, but how it is done, by what
motive we do it, and for what end.
If we beleeve there is no need but of
our own proper forces; if onely to pleaſe
men we do good; if only out of a ſervile
fear of puniſhment, which the Law
ordains, we obſerve that Law; ſurely
we are guilty in the ſecret of our
hearts; though exteriourly we appear
innocent. For if we examine well our
inclinations, we ſhall finde that we
ſhould do evil, and omit the doing of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:170075:48"/>
what is good, if it might be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
puniſhment. Whileſt we act thus,
God is not regarded by us, nor are
we touched with any loue towards
him, we conſider him rather a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
from whoſe yoak we deſire to be
freed, and which we bare with pain
and contradiction, then a moſt loving
Father, and a lawful Maſter, who is
ever obeyed with delight. It is in
this laſt quality we ought to ſerve him,
For we have not received a ſpirit of
fear and ſervitude, but a ſpirit of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption
which empowers us to call God
our Father, and as his Children to
hope for the poſſeſſion of his inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
Now we muſt not perſwade
our ſelves that we can deceive him,
for he reades in the bottom of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,
and ſees cleerly that which
we hide to others. He knowes whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we ſeek him, or our ſelves, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in him or in us, whether in his
grace or the Law we place our confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
When we expect from him, by
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:170075:48"/>
Jeſus Chriſt all our force, and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his deſign, we go unto him by the
Law, to the end he himſelfe may
work in us, and by us, that which
could not be done by its imbicility, in
order to the cure of theſe wounds which
it diſcovers to us, and to the acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of ſtrength to overcome the ſinne
which it condemnes. Then I ſay, we
work in holineſſe, and our works are
the workes of light, but when we act o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe,
we render our ſelves worthy
of his malediction: and ſeeking after
juſtice, even when we thinke to have
found it; we goe further from it. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence
reignes in us with more Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny,
and we finde that the Law en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindles
and revives it more, by reaſon
of our corruption by being born in the
ſtate of ſinne, which makes, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition
ſtirres up our deſires, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
us unable to ſupport any yoake,
but that of ſelfe-love. We thinke our
ſelves to be in good health, when wee
have poyſon at our hearts; we imagine
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:170075:49"/>
that we have raiſed a great building,
when we have failed in the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
In a word we thinke to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
Crownes of honour, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
wee are worthy of greivous pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments.
Doe not then diſpiſe the
Goſpel which diſcovers to you ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
verieties, and take heed leaſt
it happen to you as one of the Prophets
ſaid. <q>
                     <hi>You that mock, ſee and
behold, and be troubled, and
juſtly looſe your ſelves. Behold,
in your daies, I work a work that
you will not beleeve when it
ſhall bee recounted to you.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the Apoſtle ſpake in the
Synagogue. Thoſe who were
<hi>Jews</hi> in Religion but not by birth,
were much taken with his doctrin,
and with this eloquence, which
was not like that of profane Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours,
ſet out with floriſhes of
words, but with the ornament of
a real beauty, they deſired him to
entertain them the next Sabboth
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:170075:49"/>
with the ſame ſubject. The aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly
being diſmiſſed, many of
the <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> that were
faithfull followed him and <hi>Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi>
to their lodging, where they
exhorted them with vehement
words, to continue firm in profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the Goſpel. Upon the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both
following, on which day he
had promiſed to ſpeak unto them,
all the Town-flocked to the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue
to hear him. The <hi>Jewes</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuch a multitude of Gentiles,
were tranſported with ſo furious a
zeal for the honour of the Law, that
they roſe up againſt the Apoſtle,
and contradicting all thoſe verities
which he had declared to them,
uttered many blaſphemies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Then he and</hi>
Barnabas <hi>told them boldly, It is to
you that we are bound to bring the firſt
news of Salvation, but ſince you ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
your ſelves unworthy of it, and
teſtifie by diſpiſing the word of God,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:170075:50"/>
the little care you have of eternal life,
we will preſent to the Gentiles thoſe
graces which you deſerve not. The
Lord has ſo commanded us, ſaying by
his Prophet, I have ſent you to ſerve
for a light to Nations, to the end you
be their Salvation, even to the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt
part of the Earth.</hi> The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
who were in the Aſſembly
hearing them ſpeak ſo much to
their advantage, were touched
with a pious joy, and all thoſe for
whom, by an election as ſecret, as
juſt, God had prepared eternal life,
received the Doctrine preached un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, and believed in Jeſus
Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The Goſpel making a great
progreſſe through all that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
and the <hi>Jewes</hi> not able to
endure it, intreſſed the authority
of the chiefe men of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and
the ſimplicity of ſome Women of
quality, more zealous then the
reſt for the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> to raiſe
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:170075:50"/>
a ſedition againſt thoſe who (as it
ſeemed to them) went about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
it. Their violence muſt take
place. The Apoſtle ſhaking the
duſt of his feet againſt thoſe wicked
people, left their quarters, and
came to <hi>Iconium,</hi> a Town ſituated
neer to Mount <hi>Taurus</hi> in <hi>Lycaonia.</hi>
He converted there by his preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a great number of <hi>Jewes,</hi> and
<hi>Greekes;</hi> He ſtayed there a long
time, being diſmaied neither with
their ambuſhes, approbries, nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
perſecutions from the enemies
of faith. His miracles confirmed
his words, and confounded the
impiety of thoſe, who were incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous.
It was in this place where
<hi>Thecla</hi> that famous Virgin, (whoſe
Sanctity and Courage the ancient
Church hath celebrated with ſo
many Panegeriques) hearing him
ſpeak of the excellency of Virgini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
reſolved to decline a marriage
deſigned for her with a young man
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:170075:51"/>
worthy of her beauty and extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
He loved her with extreame
paſſion, and ſeeing himſelf depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of that hope, which he had ſo
much nouriſhed, his love was chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
into mortal hatred, in ſo much
that he became her perſecutor,
when ſhe was expoſed to the fury
of Lyons to be devoured by them;
they kiſſed her feet, and cloathed
themſelves with that humanity
which her Perſecutors had caſt off.
She was tied to Bulls to be torne
in pieces, She was put into a hole
full of Vipers, a great Fire was
kindled, where ſhe was to be burnt
alive, but her Heavenly Eſpouſe
delivered her from all thoſe tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and in the end ſuffered her
to dye, that ſhe might have the
glory to be the firſt Martyr in his
Church. I know that the acts of
her ſufferings ſay, ſhe died in peace,
but the opinion which I follow is
more conformable to the ſenſe of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:170075:51"/>
the ancient fathers, who ſpeak of her
as of a true Martyr. The Antients
believed they could give no higher
praiſe to a Woman of eminent
vertue then to call her <hi>another The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cla.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This converſion occaſioned unto
the Apoſtles new matter of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The <hi>Jewes,</hi> who hated him
mortally, made ſo ſtrong a party
againſt him, that they were too
prevalent for thoſe, who were of
his ſide, and without doubt they
had handled him rudely, nay per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
ſtoned him to death, if he had
not fled into other Cities of <hi>Lycao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
where he with his companion
happily ſpread the Doctrine of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p>The people having beheld the
miraculous cure in <hi>Liſtris,</hi> of a
man born lame, believed that Gods
were deſcended from Heaven to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit
them under a humane form. And
as error eaſily increaſes, they gave
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:170075:52"/>
unto <hi>Paul</hi> the name of <hi>Mercury,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he preached, and unto <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi>
the name of <hi>Iupiter.</hi> The
Prieſt of <hi>Iupiter</hi> followed by a great
multitude, came before the door
of their lodging with Crownes and
Bulls to do them the honour of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
as unto Gods.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then the Servants of the true
God not being able to endure
their impiety, came forth and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
their garments, cried out,
blinde men what go you about to
do?</hi> We are mortal creatures as you
are, and come to declare unto you,
that Idolls are Statues without
life, that you muſt leave the worſhip
of them, and render honour and a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to God, who has made Heaven
and Earth. Till now be has left the
Gentiles in their errors, though by the
order of his providence, which ſo juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
governs all things; and by thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
Benefits which he poures upon
men, giving them rain when it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:170075:52"/>
for the fruits of the Earth, and
heaping upon them a thouſand favors,
he hath in all times exhibited ſufficient
proofes of his divinity.</p>
               <p>This diſcourſe could ſcarce hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <hi>Licaonians</hi> from their ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious
deſigne; But ſoon after they
fell into another extremity: For
there came certain <hi>Iewes</hi> from <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi>
and <hi>Iconium,</hi> who knew ſo
readily and dextrouſly how to
change their humors, that they
were ſoon perſwaded to aſſiſt theſe
new comers to Stone Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
whom but a little before they
would have adored. A remarkable
example of the inconſtancy of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
favour, and an adventure fit
for the diſciple of him, who having
been received in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> as King,
fix daies after was conducted by
the ſame perſons as a Criminal to
Mount <hi>Calvary.</hi> Theſe Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of the Apoſtle dragged him
out of the gates, and there left him
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:170075:53"/>
for dead; But when the people were
gon, he roſe up, and invironed with
his Diſciples, went back into the
City, from whence he parted the
next day to <hi>Darben</hi> with his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
companion. After he had
preached the Goſpel there, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to viſit in <hi>Liſtris, Iconium,</hi>
and <hi>Antioch,</hi> thoſe whom they had
converted, teaching them better by
their example, then diſcourſe, to
continue firme in the faith of Jeſus
Chriſt, not to fear perſecutions, by
which they muſt neceſſarily paſs,
ear they arrive at a heavenly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
They eſtabliſhed Biſhops
and Prieſts, in thoſe places where
there was need, and ſo left the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of thoſe parts, wiſhing them
increaſe of all divine graces and
benedictions. They paſſed by <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidia</hi>
and <hi>Pamphilia</hi> and preached at
<hi>Pergen,</hi> and from thence went
downe into <hi>Attalia,</hi> and ſo retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to <hi>Antioch</hi> of <hi>Syria.</hi> The Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:170075:53"/>
there rejoyced wonderfully
at their return, but they were tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
with a more ſenſible joy, when
in the firſt aſſembly they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
the wonderfull things which
God had wrought by them, and
the great Harveſt they had made
amongſt the Gentiles, to whom
God had opened the gate of the
Goſpel, for which they rendered
thanks to Jeſus Chriſt, and every
one took occaſion thereby to be
more inflamed with the love of
him who rejects no perſon, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
that all ſhould come to the
knowledge of his name, without
diſtinction either of Sex, Nation, or
Quality.</p>
               <p>At this ſame time the Emperor
by an Edict baniſhed all the <hi>Jewes</hi>
from <hi>Rome,</hi> amongſt whom the
Chriſtians found themſelves com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed,
becauſe there was noe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
then made betwixt the
one and the other. The cauſe of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:170075:54"/>
this baniſhment, it may be, was,
that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> preaching the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
in the Synagogue, many were
obſtinate in oppoſition to it, and
many alſo embraced it; which
gave occaſion of ſo many diſputes,
and troubles amongſt them, that
<hi>Claudius</hi> to prevent the evill which
might happen upon theſe differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and withall making little e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem
of that Nation, commanded
them all out of the Town. The
words of <hi>Suetonius</hi> give me ground,
to attribute the baniſhment I ſpake
of to this cauſe. For he expreſly
ſaies, that the Emperor drove them
out of the City, by reaſon of the
continual tumults about Chriſt.
Now it is no wonder (this Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
being not well verſed in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of Chriſtian Religion) if he
explicate himſelf ſo imperfectly
upon this occaſion, beſides, the
<hi>Jewes</hi> were hated, and contemned
by the <hi>Romans.</hi> Hence Saint <hi>Peter</hi>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:170075:54"/>
obeying the command of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
left <hi>Italy,</hi> and came to <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi>
where he hapned to be,
by a particular conduct of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Providence, to aſſiſt and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
in the firſt Councell of the
Church. Certain perſons com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from <hi>Judea</hi> to <hi>Antioch,</hi> began
both to publiſh that Circumciſion
was neceſſary to Salvation, and
that it ought to be received by
thoſe Gentiles, who were conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the faith of Jeſus Chriſt. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the Phariſean Sect who made
profeſſion of the Goſpel, maintained
this Doctrine, and <hi>Cerinthus</hi> (after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
a notorious Hereſiarch) was
the chief of this faction that ſprung
up amongſt the faithful; which
raiſed no ſmall ſedition againſt
<hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas.</hi> To hinder what
might happen upon ſo dangerous
a diviſion, it was agreed upon by
common conſent, that the two
laſt, and ſome other perſons of the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:170075:55"/>
contrary opinion, ſhould go up to
<hi>Hieruſalem</hi> to conſult with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
and Prieſts of that Church
about this queſtion, which had ſo
much troubled the Church of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch.</hi>
In paſſing by <hi>Phenicia,</hi> and
the Region of <hi>Samaria, Paul</hi> and
<hi>Barnabas</hi> recounted to the faithful,
how great a number of Gentiles
were converted, which cauſed an
extraordinary and very ſenſible
joy in them. Arriving at <hi>Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
the Apoſtles, Prieſts, and the reſt
of the Brethren received them with
teſtimonies of extraordinary love,
and reſpect; and were much
comforted to underſtand the great
things which God had wrought
by them for the eſtabliſhment of the
Goſpel. The Phariſees that were
converted, gave them little reſt;
for, preſently upon the converſion
of the Gentiles, they made a great
noiſe, maintaining that they ought
to be Circumciſed, and were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:170075:55"/>
to the other Cerimonies of
the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> This occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the journey of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi>
as we have already ſaid, and
thereupon the Apoſtles and Prieſts
aſſembled themſelves at <hi>Hieruſalem</hi>
to debate this difficulty, which
they did with great care; Their
opinions were different, and every
one upheld his own ſenſe with
ſtrong reaſons, ſo that the queſtion
began to be more and more intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
the more they endeavored to
cleere it. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſeeing this,
made a ſigne that he would ſpeak;
which he did in this manner.</p>
               <p>Brethren, you know long ſince God
was pleaſed to make uſe of me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
his Goſpel to the Gentiles, and
conduct them to his faith; I had dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
in it at the beginning, and he
with drew me from that error, as I have
formerly told you, by a viſion which I
had in <hi>Joppa,</hi> a ſheet filled with all
ſort of creatures by the Law uncleane.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:170075:56"/>
A voice commanded me to kill, and eat.
I anſwered that I never uſed to touch
any meat uncleane, as thoſe were I
then beheld, and it was replied to me,
that nothing which God had purified,
was uncleane. In the mean time I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
a meſſage from <hi>Cornelius</hi> the
Centurion, who by birth was a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile,
but converſing with the <hi>Jewes,</hi>
had learnt to live religiouſly and fear
the true God. Then ſuddainly I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
what was meant by the viſion.
I came to <hi>Ceſarea,</hi> where I found him
with a great number of his friends, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
to hear the word of life. He
told me that an Angell had appeared,
and aſſured him that his almes, deeds,
and prayers, were mounted up to
Heaven before God, and that by his
command he had ſent to ſeek me. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this relation I preached the Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine
of Salvation to the company, and
I was happily interrupted by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent
of the Holy Ghoſt upon them, by
which they praiſed God in Languages
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:170075:56"/>
unknown to them before: So that I
was no longer in doubt whether it was
needfull to give them the Baptiſme of
Water, having received that of the
Holy Ghoſt, which ſanctified them.
At that time I was blamed for preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Goſpel to the Gentiles, but when
I had reported to the ſame Church
that which had happened in <hi>Ceſarea,</hi>
every one was ſatisfied with my procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and all that heard me, praiſed
the goodneſs of God: in that he had
withdrawen the Gentiles from the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of infidelity. Now ſince he is
pleaſed to ſhew them this mercy, that
he makes no difference between them
and us, and that he purifies the hearts
of the one, and the other by faith in
his Son; why then would you impoſe
upon the faithful, that which neither
our Fathers nor we have been able to
bear, ſince we believe that they and
we ſhall be ſaved alike, by the Grace
of our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt. The Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly
were all attentive to this
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:170075:57"/>
diſcourſe, which,</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Barnabas
<hi>obſerving, took the opportunity
of their ſilence, and recounted the
miracles, which God had wrought
by their hands, for the converſion
of the Gentiles, and having ended
this relation, which gave much
comfort to all there preſent; Saint</hi>
James <hi>who was Biſhop of</hi> Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem
<hi>demanded Audience and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Brethren, I deſire you to hear me.
<hi>Simon</hi> has related unto you how that
by his Miniſtry God has viſited the
Gentiles, and how thoſe whom we
thought to be wholly abandoned, are
now made his faithfull people, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient
to his truth. The teſtimonies
of the Prophets do accord with this his
Conduct. Amos <hi>ſaies, after this I
will returne, and I will rebuild
the Tabernacle of</hi> David <hi>which is
fallen, and I will repaire its ruins,
and I will reedifie it, to the end
the reſt of men may ſeek after the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:170075:57"/>
Lord, and all Nations by whom
his name is invocated, ſaies the
Lord that does theſe things: The
work of the Lord is known unto
him before the beginning of all
times.</hi> Let us not then be ſurpriſed,
to ſee that happen which has been fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
ſo long ſince. But rather let us
bleſs God, in that his goodneſs has ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed
his promiſes, in favour of
the Gentils; and not through an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreet
rigour, contrary to the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Goſpel, diſtaſte them in the
Faith which they have embraced. In
this occaſion, to obſerve ſome modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and neither offend the <hi>Jewes,</hi> in
abrogating all the Legal Ceremonies,
nor yet diſcourage the <hi>Gentils,</hi> with ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging
them unto obſervances too rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous;
my advice is, it will ſuffice to write
unto them, that they abſtain from meats
offered to Idols, from ſtrangled meats,
from the bloud of beaſts, and fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
For the <hi>Jewes</hi> who are conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
they are ſufficiently inſtructed in
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:170075:58"/>
abſtaining from thoſe things by the
Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> whoſe Books are read
every Sabbath in our Aſſemblies, as
well as in the Synagogue. By this, we
take away all occaſion of complaint,
that we deſpiſe his Ordinances.</p>
               <p>This opinion being univerſally
received, it was thought good by
the Apoſtles, by the Prieſts, and
by the reſt of the Faithful, to ſend
to <hi>Antioch Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnaby,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with <hi>Judas,</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Barſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas,</hi>
and <hi>Silas,</hi> men moſt eſteemed
amongſt them for their piety, who
ſhould carry the reſolution of the
Councel, which they committed
to writing, as it is in this following
Epiſtle.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtles, Biſhops, and Prieſts,
aſſembled at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> doe wiſh to
the faithful of <hi>Antioch, Syria,</hi> and
<hi>Cilicia</hi> (who amongſt the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
have received the Faith) health, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
underſtood that certain perſons
comming from this City, have troubled
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:170075:58"/>
you with diſcourſes, which we never
gave them in charge to make unto you,
we thought good to aſſemble our ſelves,
as well to examine thoſe difficulties
controverted, as to apply a remedy to
the evill already ſpread too far. And
at laſt we have reſolved to ſend you
two Deputies, our dear Brothers, <hi>Paul</hi>
and <hi>Barnaby,</hi> together with <hi>Barſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi>
and <hi>Silas,</hi> men who have a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
times expoſed their lives in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the name of our Lord Jeſus
Chriſt. They are witneſſes of what
has paſſed here, and we deſire you will
give credit to them.</p>
               <p>It has ſeemed good to the Holy
Ghoſt, and to us, not to impoſe upon
you any other yoak then that, of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining
from meats offered to Idols,
from ſtrangled meats, from bloud,
and fornication; which things you
ſhall doe well to obſerve: So fare ye
well.</p>
               <p>In theſe decrees, we may behold
the Evangelical prudence of thoſe
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:170075:59"/>
that made them; for all thoſe
things which they forbad (except
Fornication) were indifferent in
their own nature, and the liberty
of the Goſpel permitted the uſe of
them to the Faithful, freeing them
in that point from the yoak of
<hi>Moſes</hi> Law, which forbad them to
the <hi>Jewes.</hi> But the Church being
compoſed of <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
newly converted, it was neceſſary
to finde ſome way to unite two
ſorts of people that were ſo diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
in their humours, cuſtomes,
and inclinations. The <hi>Jewes</hi> were
bent even upon a ſcrupulous obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of all their Ceremonies,
and could not endure that any
ſhould violate them, ſo that it was
abſolutely neceſſary to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
things to their weakneſs; and
on the other ſide, they were to find
out ſuch an accommodation that
might not diſguſt the <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
whoſe number was much more
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:170075:59"/>
conſiderable, and who principally
were to form the Church. Behold
wherefore the Apoſtles in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
made choice of two or three
Legal obſervations, unto which
they oblige all Chriſtians without
diſtinction, forbidding the uſe of
meats ſtrangled, offered to Idols,
and bloud. For as in the ancient
Law, thoſe who participated of
the fleſh of Sacrifices which were
offered, by that action, entred in
ſome ſort into a ſociety with God,
to whom that Sacrifice was preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and made a publique profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Religion where that
worſhip was practiſed. So the
<hi>Iewes</hi> were of opinion, that thoſe
who did eat of the meats offered to
Idols, although they were Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
did acknowledge their Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and did enter into a certain
communion with thoſe falſe Gods,
of which they had a ſtrange hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
it appearing unto them an
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:170075:60"/>
impiety altogether inſupportable.
We ſee in the firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi>
which was writ a long
time after this Councel, that the
Apoſtle treating of this Subject,
gives it for a rule to the faithful, in
no ſort to uſe thoſe meats, leſt their
Brethren ſhould be ſcandalized, in
that every one was to follow the
judgement of his own conſcience,
it being a ſin to act contrary to
our own ſecret perſwaſion and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.
In the <hi>Apocalips,</hi> the Angel
reprehended the Biſhop of <hi>Thyati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi>
that he would endure a falſe
Prophetteſs to corrupt his ſervants,
by teaching them to eat of meats
offered to Idols, which in a word
derived from the Greek, are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Idolothites.</hi> The Apoſtles there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
to hinder this diviſion, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad
the uſe of theſe meats, which
continued a long time in the
Church, as well as that prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the bloud of beaſts in the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:170075:60"/>
time of <hi>Noah,</hi> a little after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge.
Some Eccleſiaſtical Authors,
and the moſt ancient, were of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
that by the word bloud,
the Apoſtles meant to forbid ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micide;
but nature and civil Laws
rigorouſly forbid that, both to
<hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Therefore this
prohibition we now mention, is
to be underſtood of the bloud of
beaſts, and we ſee it renewed in the
Councels of <hi>Gangren, Orleans,</hi> and
<hi>Wormes.</hi> The <hi>Pagans</hi> reproached
the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that in their Night-Aſſemblies
they uſed to kill an
Infant, and eat the fleſh of it all
bloudy. But <hi>Tertullian</hi> anſwers
them excellently; <hi>That the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
are ſo far from doing ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrable
homicide, that tis not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to them to eat the bloud of beaſts;
and therefore Executioners were wont
to preſent it to them, ſo to try their
fidelity in the obſervation of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
of their Religion.</hi> The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:170075:61"/>
                  <hi>Leo</hi> renewed this Decree, with
penalties againſt thoſe who ſhould
violate it. But a little after, when
the Church feared no more diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and ſcandal, being almoſt whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
compoſed of <hi>Pagans</hi> converted,
this Apoſtolical Decree againſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focated
fleſh was no longer obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
and there are certain Fathers,
who alledging this paſſage of the
<hi>Acts,</hi> make no mention at all of
it. Nevertheleſs, tis certain the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
expreſſed it, to content the
<hi>Iewes,</hi> who were not permitted to
eat of any ſuffocated creature, nor
of any other before they had
drawn out the bloud. Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Fornication, which is the laſt
thing contained in the Decree of
the Councel, the Apoſtles made no
new precept, as if, till then it were
not forbidden, and had been an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
action. For there is no
doubt but that it is againſt the law
of nature; which in the conjunction
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:170075:61"/>
of man and woman, tends to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
of children, and their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation,
and civil ſocieties. Now,
Fornication is contrary to this
end; for, thoſe, who defile them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in that manner, think of
nothing but voluptuouſneſs, and
thoſe women ordinarily render
themſelves uncapable of conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
by their intemperance; and
if they doe conceive, having no
certain Father, their education is
neglected, and ordinarily they are
prejudicial and burthenſome to
Common-wealths. The <hi>Iewes</hi>
doubted not, but Fornication was
unlawful, for they well underſtood
that precept of the Decalogue, <hi>Thou
ſhalt not commit adultery,</hi> which
contained in it this kinde of impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
The women of their Nation
were forbidden publique proſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and <hi>P<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>inees</hi> merited the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
for having killed an <hi>Iſraelite</hi>
that fornicated with a <hi>Moabitiſh</hi>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:170075:62"/>
woman. But it was not ſo with
the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who had made many
ſtrict and rigorous Lawes againſt
adultery, and none againſt forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
nor keeping of Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines;
beleeving that neither na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
nor the Republick, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed,
or endamaged by this
action, which a general corruption
had made common, and upon
which the Civil Government had
made no reflexion. The purity
of the body, no leſs then that of
the minde, is an Evangelical ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and onely Jeſus Chriſt was
able to teach a forme of life to
men, that having bodies, they
ſhould live as if they had none.
This digreſſion I thought neceſſary
for thoſe who are not ſo well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
with the motives which
occaſioned the Apoſtles in this
firſt Councel to make theſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees.
Thoſe who were appointed
to carry the Letter, arrived happily
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:170075:62"/>
at <hi>Antioch,</hi> where having aſſembled
the Church, it was read, to the
wonderful joy of all the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.
<hi>Iudas</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> who were
great Preachers, did much comfort
the faithful, by the admirable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
which upon divers occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
they made. After ſome few
dayes, <hi>Iudas</hi> returned to <hi>Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
leaving <hi>Silas</hi> with <hi>Paul</hi> and
<hi>Barnaby,</hi> who continued in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Goſpel with wonderfull
fruit, not diſdaining to have other
companions in this Miniſtery,
wherein they ſought nothing but
the glory of Jeſus Chriſt, and the
ſalvation of ſouls.</p>
               <p>It was at that time the famous
difference happened betwixt Saint
<hi>Peter</hi> and our Apoſtle. The firſt
having lived indifferently amongſt
the <hi>Gentiles</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> without
making any other diſtinction of
meats, then what the Councel had
ordained, upon a ſudden changed
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:170075:63"/>
the whole manner of his life, and
retired himſelf from them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he would not ſcandalize cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Iewes</hi> who were newly come
from <hi>Hieruſalem.</hi> This good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of his, produced an ill ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;
for the authority of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
drew the greateſt part of
the faithful to follow him, and
<hi>Barnaby</hi> alſo began in his imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to Judaiſe. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſeeing
the dangerous conſequence of this
proceeding, which might renew
the diſputes that were happily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed,
and trouble the conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the converted <hi>Gentiles;</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
with an ardent and diſ-intereſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
zeale for the ſalvation of the
<hi>Gentiles,</hi> oppoſed him (whom o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
he extreamly honoured)
in the face of the whole Church;
but in this occaſion he judged him
blameable, not carrying himſelfe
according to the truth of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.
Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> upon this repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:170075:63"/>
did <hi>acquieſce,</hi> and in his
owne defence alledged not at all
the priviledge of his Primacy.</p>
               <p>There is no doubt but he
had his reaſons for what he did;
and tis not to be beleeved, that an
Apoſtle ſo zealous for the glory of
the Goſpel, could propoſe to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
any other end in this occaſion,
then the ſalvation of the <hi>Iewes</hi> who
made profeſſion of Chriſtianity;
and therefore he feared they might
be ſcandalized, to ſee him eat in
their preſence meats which they
held polluted. There is no doubt
but the obſervation of the Legal
Ceremonies was left to the diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Apoſtles, in what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
themſelves. And it appears
in effect; for after S. <hi>Paul</hi> thus had
blamed Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> in that he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to Judaiſe by his manner of
living, he himſelf circumciſed <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,</hi>
becauſe he would not offend
the <hi>Iewes;</hi> and when he came to
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:170075:64"/>
                  <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> he practiſed the Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
ordained by the Law to
the <hi>Nazarites,</hi> as we ſhall ſee in
the courſe of this Hiſtory: But,
as that which is permitted is not
alwayes fit, and the ſame action
which is done for fear of ſcandali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
ſome, many times does ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalize
others, who have different
thoughts upon it; we muſt not
wonder at the carriage of Saint
<hi>Peter,</hi> which was good, in reſpect
of the <hi>Iewes</hi> that came from <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi>
yet wrought an ill effect
in the <hi>Gentiles</hi> of <hi>Antioch;</hi> ſo that
the fault of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was in the
ſucceſs, and, at the moſt, we can
but accuſe him not to have well
conſidered what evil the change in
his manner of life might occaſion.
Although we owe a great reſpect
to the Head of the Church, yet we
muſt not violate the Holy Text,
to excuſe him from any the leaſt
failing, and accuſe his Fellow-brother,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:170075:64"/>
that he blamed him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonably,
and with too much va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
as the enemies of Chriſtian
Religion, and Heretikes doe. Some
of the ancient Fathers beleeved,
that this <hi>Cephas,</hi> of whom it is
ſpoken, was not the Apoſtle Saint
<hi>Peter,</hi> but one of the Diſciples of
our Lord. This opinion is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown
by the enſuing Text of
Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſets down the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of this diſpute. Many Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of great note, amongſt whom
Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> have maintained
that this difference of the two A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
was a thing agreed on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them for the ſalvation of the
<hi>Iewes;</hi> for ſeeing the <hi>Iewes</hi> (ſay
they) notwithſtanding the Decree
of the Councel of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> were
alwayes offended at the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
eating of meats forbidden by the
Law, they agreed that Saint <hi>Peter</hi>
ſhould take occaſion, upon the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival
of thoſe who came from <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:170075:65"/>
to retire from the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
and table of the converted
<hi>Gentiles,</hi> and thereupon Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
ſhould reprehend him for this acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the open Aſſembly of the
faithful; to the which, he replying
nothing, but contrarywiſe by his
ſilence acknowledging himſelf to
have failed, the <hi>Iewes,</hi> doubtleſs
convinced by the example of their
Maſter, would leave their ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and uſe the holy liberty which
the Councel allowed them, or at
leaſt would not take it ill that the
<hi>Geniiles</hi> ſhould uſe it. They ground
the diſſimulation upon this, that
there is no likelyhood, in their
judgements, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
in Saint <hi>Peter</hi> a Judaical
practiſe, when as he ſoon after was
to circumciſe his diſciple <hi>Timothy;</hi>
and much leſs blame him in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,
which had been a ſcandal to
the faithful. Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
this opinion, but Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:170075:65"/>
holds it to be of dangerous
conſequence, for the truth of the
holy Scriptures, and for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and ſincerity of thoſe two
Apoſtles, believing, that to diſſemble
in a ſubject of ſo great conſequence,
made a notable alteration. He
honoured Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> yet would
not excuſe him from having fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
ſo, as to accuſe Saint <hi>Paul</hi> of
an untruth: It ſeemed alſo to him
as ſtrange, as if to purge him from
the reproach of having denyed Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, one ſhould ſay the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
lyed, becauſe it reports this
weakneſs of him. The difference
of their opinions, produced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them a conteſt by Letters,
which leſſened not their charity,
but was cauſe that the Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
excellent inſtructions, both
from the one and the other, and
was no leſs edified in her Infancy,
by the generous liberty of St. <hi>Pauls</hi>
correction, then by the humility
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:170075:66"/>
of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> who received it. The
neceſſity of providing for the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the <hi>Gentils,</hi> who were
endangered by that action of Saint
<hi>Peter,</hi> to be averſed from the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
and the troubles again to be
revived, which the Councel had
happily quieted, obliged him who
was their Apoſtle, to tax in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,
a publique conduct, which
he judged not to be conformable
to to the verity of the Goſpel. But
we muſt alſo admire the generous
and profound humility of him,
upon whom our Lord had founded
the building of his Church, that
he endured ſo mildely, and with
ſuch patience, a publique corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
without either alledging his
Rank, or his good intentions in
defence of what he had done. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
he who was reprehended in
this manner, appears more admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
then he who reprehended
him, and much harder to imitate;
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:170075:66"/>
for it is more facile to ſee in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that which is ill, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
it, then to ſee what is fit to be
corrected in ones ſelfe, and quietly
to endure reproach for it in the face
of al the faithful, who, by that acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
might have a leſs good opinion
of him then they had before.</p>
               <p>This Diſpute, which made no
diminution of charity amongſt
thoſe who propoſe nothing for the
end of all their actions, but the
glory of God, was preſently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
with another Diſpute,
which alſo diſ-united not their
hearts, though it did their perſons.
St. <hi>Paul</hi> judging it fit to viſit the
Churches where he and <hi>Barnabas</hi>
had preached, acquainted him with
his deſigne; he preſently appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of it, knowing well that thoſe
new Plants ſtood in need of being
cultivated by the ſame hands which
had planted and watred them with
ſo much labour. But he was of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:170075:67"/>
it was fit to take to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
<hi>John</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Mark.</hi> The
Apoſtle held this choice neither
reaſonable, nor profitable, becauſe
he had left them in <hi>Pamphilia,</hi> and
came not with them to thoſe
Townes which they were to viſit;
and ſo conſequently being a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to all things there, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known,
he could not labour there
with profit. <hi>Barnaby</hi> wanted not
reaſons for his opinion; ſo that
not agreeing, they choſe rather to
ſever themſelves, and divide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them the imployment of
their Miniſtery; and this, no doubt,
by the conduct of the Holy Ghoſt,
which brought great advantages
to the places where they preached
by their ſeparation. The Apoſtle,
by this rigour towards St. <hi>Mark,</hi>
intended to make him know the
fault<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he had committed in leaving
them; whether it was for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
of diſcommodities he
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:170075:67"/>
was to ſuffer, or for ſome other
reaſon, which Saint <hi>Luke</hi> ſets not
down; or perhaps foreſeeing he
was to run more dangers, and
greater diſcommodities then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and fearing he might not have
ſufficient courage to reſiſt, ſo that
abandoning them the ſecond time,
it would encreaſe the ſhame of
what he had formerly done. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naby</hi>
on the other ſide, who loved
him as his Kinſman, thought this
weakneſs of his was to be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
and that he ought to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
againe into their company, to
give him meanes thereby to repair
his errour. Thus each of them
had moſt pure intentions, and far
from any particular, or ſelf-inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts.
But in the event, <hi>Mark</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited
by Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> ſeverity, and
in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> he
ſpeaks of him as one of his deare
diſciples.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtles thus ſeparated
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:170075:68"/>
                  <hi>Barnaby</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> took the way of
<hi>Cyprus.</hi> Tradition ſayes he came
into <hi>Italy,</hi> and there founded the
Church of <hi>Milan.</hi> Ancient Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical
Authors cite an Epiſtle un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his name, which contains moſt
holy inſtructions. Some have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to him that Epiſtle which
is directed to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by the Church into the
number of Apoſtolical and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical
Letters. But we will
ſpeak of this difficulty in another
place.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle having choſen <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi>
for his companion, took leave
of the faithfull of <hi>Antioch,</hi> who
could not part with him without
much ſorrow, being very ſenſible
of his charitable obligations to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them. He paſſed through
<hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Cilicia,</hi> and in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
where he came, confirmed, and
exhorted all the Chriſtians to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
firme in their faith, and in
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:170075:68"/>
the obſervation of the Apoſtolical
Decrees newly publiſhed. In <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris,</hi>
a Diſciple of our Lord, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>Timothy,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Eunice,</hi> a
<hi>Iew</hi> by Nation, and of a Father that
was a <hi>Centile,</hi> lived in ſo great
fame and ſanctity, that the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants,
and thoſe of <hi>Iconium;</hi> had
him in great eſteem. This man he
took along with him; and leſt the
<hi>Iewes</hi> who accompanied him, might
murmur, and alſo to open him a
way, the better to announce the
Goſpel unto others, he circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
him. In all places where he
paſſed, the efficacy of his ſpeech
not onely confirmed the faithfull,
but converted unbeleevers, and
produced dayly to the Church a
notable increaſe. The Holy Ghoſt
was their guide, and it was by his
command, that paſſing by <hi>Phrygia</hi>
and <hi>Galatia,</hi> they preached not
there. If one ſhould ask the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of it, humane wiſdome would
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:170075:69"/>
be at a ſtand, but true piety will
acknowledge that ſhe knowes no
other then the will of God, who
owing to none the light of the
Goſpel, injures not any, from
whom, by a hidden judgement, this
heavenly ray is with-held, or to
whom it is not diſcovered before
the time he has ordained. Being
in <hi>Myſia,</hi> they meant to goe to <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinia,</hi>
but the Spirit of Jeſus would
not ſuffer them. Having therefore
traverſt <hi>Myſia,</hi> they deſcended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Town of <hi>Troad,</hi> where in
the night the Apoſtle had this Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
A man attired after the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonian</hi>
manner, appeared, and
ſpake to him in an humble and
ardent way; <hi>Come into</hi> Macedonia,
<hi>and aſſiſt us.</hi> This was an evident
proofe to him, that it was the
will of God he ſhould preach
the Goſpel in that Country. He
would not therefore defer it, but
the next morning embarked him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:170075:69"/>
with his company, to whom,
<hi>Luke</hi> the Evangeliſt, who penned
the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles,</hi> was joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
From <hi>Troad</hi> they cam direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the Iſle of <hi>Samothrace;</hi> from
thence to <hi>Neapolis,</hi> and afterwards
to <hi>Phillipis,</hi> a famous City of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia,</hi>
and then a Colony of the
<hi>Romans.</hi> It was there he began to
preach the Goſpel, carrying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
with great prudence, becauſe
the Inhabitants were almoſt all
<hi>Gentiles,</hi> living under the <hi>Roman</hi>
Lawes, and under an Emperour,
enemy to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> who were
there but in a ſmall number; ſo
that a little Oratory without the
Towne was ſufficient for their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly.
Upon a Sabbath-day the
Apoſtle went thither; and ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to ſome women, whom he there
met, there was one of them called
<hi>Lidia,</hi> whoſe Trade was to dye pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
the heart of this woman God
opened, to receive the Doctrine
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:170075:70"/>
which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> announced. He
baptized her, and all her Family.
She willing in ſome manner to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
the great grace which
ſhe had received by his Miniſtery,
ſaid unto him, <hi>If you beleeve that I
am truly faithfull to our Lord, grace
me ſo much as to retire into my houſe.</hi>
The Apoſtle granted her that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation,
and came to lodge in her
houſe. Not long after, as he went
with <hi>Silas</hi> to the place of publique
prayer, a young Maid, in whom
the Devil ſpake, and foretold hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
things, followed them, and
cryed out aloud ſeverall times,
<hi>Theſe men are the ſervants of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
God, and they announce unto you
the way of Salvation.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
was angry to have this teſtimony
from the Father of lyes; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
turning himſelfe towards this
young Maid, he ſaid to the Devil,
<hi>I command thee in the name of Ieſus
Chriſt to goe out of this body, and at
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:170075:70"/>
the very inſtant he departed from her.</hi>
The Maſters of this Divining Maid
ſeeing themſelves deprived of the
great gaine which they made by
her means, laid hands on S. <hi>Paul</hi> and
<hi>Silas,</hi> and carried them before the
Magiſtrates, accuſing them to be
<hi>Iewes,</hi> and that they ſought to
raiſe ſedition in the City, and to
teach a Doctrine which was not
lawfull for the <hi>Romans</hi> to embrace.
The people, without any other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
fall upon them; and
the Magiſtrates, ſeconding their
fury, cauſed them to be cruelly
whipt, and after that puniſhment,
ſent them to priſon, with expreſs
order there to be ſtrictly guarded;
which the Goaler, being rigorous
enough of himſelfe, did eaſily o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey.
He put them into a deep dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon,
and tyed their feet in ſuch
ſort that they could not ſtir: But
their minds were free, though their
bodies were not: And thinking
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:170075:71"/>
not of what they had ſuffered, nor
of what they might feare, when
every one ſlept, they ſung hymnes
to God, who preſently manifeſted
how pleaſing they were unto him;
for the priſon was ſhaken with a
great Earthquake; the gates opened
of themſelves, and the chains of all
the priſoners fell off. The Goa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
waking at this fearful noiſe, and
ſeeing all the doors open, thought
thoſe he had in cuſtody were all
fled, which ſo much troubled him,
knowing his life muſt pay for their
eſcape, that drawing out his ſword,
he would have killed himſelf; but
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> cryed out with a loud
voice, <hi>Hurt not yonr ſelfe, we are all
here, and not one of us thinks of eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping.</hi>
Thoſe words brought the
Goaler to himſelfe, and made him
change the deſperate deſig<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e he had
taken: And at the ſame time the
grace of God aſſured him, that
the Earthquake which then hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:170075:71"/>
and the flying open of the
priſon-dores, proceeded not from
any natural cauſe; and that thoſe,
who from the dungeon could know
what he was about to doe, muſt
needs be extraordinary men. He
lighted a candle, and going into
the dungeon where the Apoſtle
was, caſt himſelfe at his feet, then
led him and <hi>Silas</hi> into another
room, where being preſſed by the
ſecret impulſe of his conſcience,
he demanded of them what he was
to doe that he might be ſaved?
They anſwered, <hi>Beleeve in Jeſus
Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that they explicated to him,
and to all his Family, in what this
faith conſiſted. The Goaler em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
it, was baptiſed, with his
whole Family; he waſh'd their
wounds, as they had done thoſe
of his ſoule. He preſently cauſed
the Table to be covered, and gave
his inſtructers to eat, who had need
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:170075:72"/>
of it, and devoutly rejoyced with
them for the great mercy which
God had pleaſed to ſhew unto him
by their means. At break of day,
certain Officers came from the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
into the priſon, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the Goaler to free the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners
they had ſent thither the
day before. <hi>What</hi> (ſayes the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle)
<hi>after you have whipped inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Citizens of</hi> Rome, <hi>and without
any forme of juſtice, and after you
have put them in priſon, doe you
think to make them goe thus private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
away without reparation, as if they
were culpable of ſome crime for which
they had deſerved to be ſo ſhamefully
treated? No, we cannot doe ſo great
an injury to our innocence. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let thoſe who ſent us hither,
come themſelves, if they will have us
out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Judges informed of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
perceived the error they had
committed, &amp; the danger to which
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:170075:72"/>
they were expoſed, in treating thus
perſons whom the priviledge of a
Citizen exempted from the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of whipping; For by Saint
<hi>Pauls</hi> diſcourſe, they beleeved <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi>
had alſo the ſame priviledge,
although it was onely the Apoſtle
that could claime it; but they
would not make this diſtinction,
to terrifie the more thoſe who had
ſo unjuſtly treated both of them
for one ſame cauſe. This anſwer
cauſed them to come, and entreat
the priſoners with fair words to
goe out of priſon, and out of the
Town, and to impute that which
had happened, to the ſedition of
the people, for which they were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſorry. The Apoſtles went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
and returned to the houſe of
<hi>Lidia,</hi> where, after they had ſtayed
ſome time, and recounted to the
faithfull what had paſſed, and by
their diſcourſe fortified their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
they left this ungrateful Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:170075:73"/>
and taking circuit through
<hi>Amphipolis</hi> and <hi>Apollonia,</hi> from
thence went to <hi>Theſſalonica.</hi> St.
<hi>Paul</hi> went into the Synagogue of
the <hi>Jewes</hi> three Sabbath dayes ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively,
according to the cuſtome
which he obſerved; firſt of all to
ſpeak to thoſe of his Nation. He
ſhewed them by the authority of
Holy Scriptures, and by a cleare
Explication of the Prophets, that
Chriſt, who was promiſed them,
had already ſuffered, and was ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
againe from the dead. He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
unto them this Jeſus
Chriſt, and that he was the true
Meſſias; whereupon, ſome who
were by Nation, <hi>Jewes,</hi> received the
faith. He converted a far greater
number of <hi>Gentiles</hi> by birth, who
made profeſſion of <hi>Iudaiſme,</hi> or
who, without obſerving the Law,
beleeved in one ſole God, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him; for the Greek Text of the
<hi>Acts</hi> may be explicated in this dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:170075:73"/>
ſenſe; and amongſt them were
divers women of condition, who
alſo embraced the Goſpel. The
<hi>Iewes</hi> that remained obſtinate, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to endure the ſucceſs of the
Apoſtles preaching, gained ſome
wicked men of the people, by
whoſe meanes they raiſed a ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the Town. They came in
great numbers to the houſe of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi>
where <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> lodged,
and not finding them there, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
their rage upon their Hoſt,
and dragged him out of doores,
together with ſome other faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
before the Magiſtrates:
The pretence was, that they had
harboured ſeditious men, who
troubled the publique quiet, and
offended the Imperial Majeſty of
<hi>Caeſar,</hi> giving out, that a certaine
Jeſus Chriſt was King. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Citizens of <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> and
ſuch of the people as underſtood
this diſcourſe, were preſently mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:170075:74"/>
with choler; but <hi>Iaſon</hi> ſo well
ſatisfied them, whether by aſſuring
that thoſe who were accuſed, and
brought before them, had no more
deſigne then himſelfe to trouble
the publique peace, or whether it
was by giving caution for their
innocency, and undertaking for
their appearance (the Text of the
<hi>Acts</hi> not mentioning what ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
he gave) that they diſmiſſed
him, with the reſt of his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> makes mention of
this <hi>Iaſon</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;</hi>
and ſome Authors will have,
that he was afterwards Biſhop of
<hi>Tharſius.</hi> When night was come,
the faithfull whom this danger had
alarm'd, conveyed <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi>
out of <hi>Theſſalonica.</hi> Thoſe who
performed this Office, in perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
them to retire, ſo to preſerve
their lives, very neceſſary for the
good of the Church, were of the
moſt conſiderable perſons in the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:170075:74"/>
City. They had received the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Apoſtle with great
fervour, and would ſo firmly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print
it in their minde, that every
day they turned over the Books of
the Holy Scripture which St. <hi>Paul</hi>
had alledged, not that they doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of his ſincerity, but to confirm
themſelves, by their owne know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
in the beliefe of thoſe veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which he had declared unto
them. The Apoſtles following the
ſhoar of the <hi>Aegean</hi> Sea, turning
towards the South, and leaving
<hi>Pella,</hi> a famous City, in giving
birth to <hi>Alexander,</hi> they came to
<hi>Beroe,</hi> a City of <hi>Macedonia.</hi> The
newes flew as far as <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi>
from whence the enemies of Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> ran in great diligence, and
being arrived, prefently ſtirred up
the ignorant people againſt him
who announced truth unto them.
This cauſed the faithful to conduct
him to the Sea-ſhore; ſome of
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:170075:75"/>
them accompanied him as far as
<hi>Athens,</hi> where he was met by <hi>Silas</hi>
and <hi>Timothy.</hi> This City once fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
for the Empire of <hi>Greece,</hi> and
Sciences, after divers revolutions,
was fallen under the power of the
<hi>Romans:</hi> And although it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
declined from its firſt ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,
and particularly from that of
Philoſophy, and other Diſciplines,
for which Saint <hi>Greogory</hi> of <hi>Nazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anzen</hi>
calls it the ſeat and abode of
Philoſophy, yet there was ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
in it enough to make the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
judge that it was very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
for the glory of God, there
to make known the verities of the
Goſpel. Beſides Learning, which
there flouriſhed, the Councel of
the <hi>Areopagits,</hi> Sovereign Judges
of Important Affaires, rendered it
very famous; but Idolatry diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
it: For it ſeemed to glory
in gathering together all the Idols
of the World, as if it feared one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:170075:75"/>
not to be ſuperſtitious enough.
After they had erected Altars to
the known Gods, adored by other
Nations, they raiſed others <hi>to the
unknown Gods</hi> of <hi>Europe, Aſia,</hi> and
<hi>Africa,</hi> as ſome Authors write;
and according to others, to the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
God,</hi> as it is ſet down in the
<hi>Acts of the Apoſtles,</hi> to the end they
might forget no Divinity, believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that a great plague had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
to them for their neglect to
ſome unknown God. Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
beholding this City ſo miſerably
plunged in the impiety of falſe
Gods, found his heart warmed
with a new zeale, and touched
with a moſt ſenſible griefe for the
loſs of ſo many ſoules. He diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
in the Synagogues with the
<hi>Iewes,</hi> and the <hi>Proſelytes;</hi> and in
publique places, to thoſe he met,
he ſpake of the death and reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Jeſus Chriſt. The Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean
Philoſophers, and the <hi>Stoicks</hi>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:170075:76"/>
diſputed often with him. Saint
<hi>Luke</hi> makes no mention of Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
of other Sects. Theſe cared
not to embrace a Religion that
ſpake of nothing but how to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
their ſenſes, and renounce the
voluptuous pleaſures of body and
minde, to follow Jeſus crucified;
for they place their ſovereign good
in pleaſure, denying Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
and the immortality of
the ſoule, which is the Baſis of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
They alſo were more ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enated
by the vanity of their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions;
for they acknowledging no
corruption in humane nature by
original ſin (in which they agreed
with the other Philoſophers) went
yet further, making a God of their
Wiſe man, or rather a Devil of
Pride. He onely, according to
their imagination, was knowing,
happy, powerful, exempt from er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
unſenſible of irregular paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
King of all things, and
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:170075:76"/>
of himſelfe, and without need
of any thing but from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>Theſe principles were very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Doctrine preached by
the Apoſtles, which hath for foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
mans ignorance in his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
and infirmity in his
will, whence it comes, that of
himſelfe (ſin having put him into
this condition) he knowes not
what is fit for him to doe, and Ieſs
able to performe, when he comes
to know it. This double wound
preſuppoſed, and experience ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
taught the <hi>Iewes</hi> that their
Law could not cure them; and
likewiſe the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that neither
the light of nature, nor that of Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
had the power to give them
a real remedy, it was not hard to
diſpoſe men to receive the Goſpel
of Jeſus Chriſt, which brought
with it perfect health; for every
one deſires to be freed from errour
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:170075:77"/>
and weakneſs, when he comes to
know that he is plunged into it:
And on the other ſide, we ſlight
Phyſitians when we think we have
no need of them. Even ſo did
theſe two Sects of Philoſophers, of
whom we ſpeak; who finding (as
they thought) great abſurdities in
the Doctrine of the Apoſtle, ſome
of them called him a Talker, that
propoſed things which he could
not prove; others ſaid that he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed
of new Spirits, not being
able to comprehend that which he
preached of the reſurrection of our
Lord, and of his Divinity. This
Conteſtation, which dayly grew
into more heat in the publique
place of meeting, was cauſe that
they conducted Saint <hi>Paul</hi> before
the <hi>Areopagites,</hi> to the end he might
more clearly explicate the doctrin
which he taught, the novelty
whereof had ſtirred up the curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> who had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:170075:77"/>
employment all the day, then
either to learn, or debate newes.
The Apoſtle appeared in this place,
where all others uſed to tremble,
with a bold modeſty: There they
asked him if they might hear this
new Doctrine which he taught; and
when ſilence was made, he ſpake in
this manner.</p>
               <p>Athenians; I obſerve, that in your
religious worſhip you forget nothing;
nay, therein you are exact, even to
exceſs. For you are not content to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore
thoſe Gods you know, and to whom
all the Earth does render homage, but,
paſſing by the publique place of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
I ſaw an Altar with this Inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>To the unknown God.</hi> You
have not raiſed this Altar, but with
deſigne to honour this unknown God;
and this day my deſigne is to make
him known unto you. Wherefore, ſince
I am to ſpeak to you of a thing ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant;
and ſince I deſire to inſtruct
you in that which you ſo ſolemnly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:170075:78"/>
to know, I cannot but in reaſon
promiſe to my ſelf a favourable aud
quiet Audience. And this gives me
alſo great confidence, that I ſpeak
not to ignorant vulgar people, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed
with common errours, ſo as
to be incapable of underſtanding any
truth contrary to what they fancy.
Thoſe who hear me, are equally hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
by their Learning, and by their
Adminiſtration of juſtice; the one of
theſe cannot have a more noble Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
then Divinity; nor the other a
more conſiderable employment then the
ſetling of a true worſhip due to that
Divinity. God, who has not onely
created the matter of the world, but
all things in the world, and has pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
them in that order, which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
behold without admiration, dwells
not in Temples made by the hands of
men. He cannot be incloſed, becauſe
there is no other place that containes
him, but the incomprehenſible immen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of his being. He has no need of
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:170075:78"/>
Victimes nor of Sacrifices, nor of the
homage of men, finding in himſelfe
his glory, his felicity, and an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
plenitude of all things. It is he
who has formed the body of the firſt
man, and by the breath of his mouth
infuſed into him a ſoule, not drawne
from his ſubſtance, or from an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
ſoule, but created of nothing
by his omnipotent power, to make the
moſt noble compoſition that was in the
world. He has ingraved in him his
own image, making it intelligent, as
he is intelligent, ſpiritual, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall,
as he is a Spirit immortall.
All men are deſcended from this one
man, and God has given them the
whole Earth for their habitation, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
it amongſt them, according to
the deſignes of his providence. They
cannot excuſe themſelves who know
him not; for on which ſide ſoever
they caſt their eyes, they behold in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
creature the greatneſs of him that
made them. It is to that end he has
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:170075:79"/>
made them; for he being a pure ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
corporeal men could not know
him, but by corporeal things. He
would (if it be lawful to ſay ſo) that
they ſhould touch him, as it were, with
their finger, and as blinde men
know, and diſcerne thoſe objects by
their touch, which they ſee not: So
likewiſe by ſenſible, and viſible things,
we arrive to the knowledge of a being
inviſible and immortal. And truly
herein we need no forreign Maſter to
inſtruct us, nor any other looking-glaſs
then our ſelves. For if we will atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
conſider what we are, and what
happens in us, the wonderful aecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of our ſoul and body, the variety
of their faculties, and operations, we
ſhall be inforced to acknowledge that
God is not far diſtant from every one
of us. <hi>What do I ſay?</hi> He is in the
very Centre of our being, which he fills,
which he conſerves, which he makes
to act; ſo that it is by him we live,
by him we move, and by him we are.
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:170075:79"/>
Your Poets were not ignorant of this
verity, for one of them has ſaid, we
are the poſterity and race of God. If
we have ſo great an honour, if we bear
the reſemblance of our Creatour and
Father; how is it poſſible that being
more noble, not onely in reſpect of our
ſoule, but of our body alſo, then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Gold or Silver; we can think
that a ſtatue made of thoſe Mettles
is a God, who is ſo much elevated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all men. How can thoſe of the
weakeſt judgements believe that the
moſt Supream being, reſembles thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
figures which depend upon
the invention and conceipts of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers?
How can they admit for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
worſhip, that worſhip which is
ridiculous? How can they think that
Idols which have no eares can heare
them. The true God has taken pitty
of that unhappy ignorance, in which
all the Nations of the world were invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and in which by his juſt Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he left them, untill he thought it
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:170075:80"/>
fit to diſcover the truth unto them, to
the end they might doe pennance, and
avoid his wrath in that dreadful day,
where Jeſus Chriſt (whom by his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
I announce unto you) ſhall judge
the living and the dead, with as much
rigour as juſtice. The <hi>Jewes,</hi> inſtead
of hearing him, called him a ſeducer,
and in acknowledgement of the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
he wrought amongſt them by cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their ſick, raiſing their dead, faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
him to the Croſs. But God his
Father, raiſed him again the third
day, and made him Judge of all men,
to pronounce that Sovereigne decree of
a life eternally happy, or of miſeries,
which ſhall never end. In the mean
time he will for a while ſuffer the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels
to triumph, and exerciſe their
rage againſt him. They ſhall oppoſe
his Doctrine by Kings, by the People,
and by the wiſe of the World, by
Threats, by Promiſes, and by ſuch
cruel torments as the Executioners
themſelves ſhall have a horror of them.
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:170075:80"/>
But in the end his day ſhall come, and
he at once ſhall reveng e himſelfe of all
his enemies. At the dreadfull ſound of
a Trumpet, all the dead who ſleep in
their graves ſhall come forth, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
before the Tribunal of th is terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Judge, and render an accompt of
all their actions.</p>
               <p>The Audience taking theſe laſt
words of the Apoſtle to be very
extravagant, interrupted him with
great laughter, but ſome amongſt
them were modeſt, and more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet,
told him they would hear
him another time ſpeak of this
ſubject; ſo he went out of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reopage:
notwithſtanding his
preaching was not without fruit,
for one of the moſt conſiderable
Magiſtrates, called <hi>Denis,</hi> imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the Goſpel. Saint <hi>Luke</hi> alſo
adds, that a Woman called <hi>Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi>
was alſo converted, and ſome
Fathers ſay, that ſhe was the Wife
of this <hi>Denis;</hi> but others hold
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:170075:81"/>
the contrary. The <hi>Greekes</hi> in their
Menology make mention of one
<hi>Hierotheus,</hi> whom the Apoſtle al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
converted, and who was one
of the Nine Senators of the Areo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page;
but beſides that, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of them is not determined, it
is not likely alſo, Saint <hi>Luke</hi>
would forget to note the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of ſo conſiderable a man,
whom Saint <hi>Denis</hi> calls his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>France</hi> glories to have <hi>Denis</hi> for
her Apoſtle, and <hi>Paris</hi> for her
firſt Biſhop. This tradition is not
ſo conſtantly received of all the
world, but that many objections
which ſeem very ſtrong, are
brought againſt it, the writings
which are attributed to him, give
alſo great occaſion of controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
both in reſpect of their matter
and form; for in the ſtile (in
the judgements of many learned
men) correſponds not with the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:170075:81"/>
ſimplicity, and plainneſs, of the
Eccleſiaſtical writers of thoſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
times. And for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which concernes the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
in adminiſtration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
ſome are of opinion
they are more Modern. But I
leave this nice diſpute, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
my ſelf to note the diverſity of
opinions which are upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
as an Hiſtorian, without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
my judgement to decide
them, either in favour, or againſt
an ancient tradition, which to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſeems ſo venerable.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle leaving the Church
of <hi>Athens</hi> under the government of
this <hi>Denis</hi> newly converted, went
to <hi>Corinth.</hi> There he met with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quila,</hi>
and <hi>Priſcilla</hi> his Wife, whom
the Edict of <hi>Claudius</hi> had driven
from <hi>Rome:</hi> They were not onely
of the faithful, and of the ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with him, but alſo of the ſame
trade in making of Tents and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilions;
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:170075:82"/>
which he had learnt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the cuſtome of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees,
whoſe Sect obliged the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
to know and practiſe ſome
Mechanique Art. This was the
occaſion which drew him to lodge
with them, nor diſdained he to
labour with his hands, and get his
bread by the ſweat of his browe,
to fulfill the firſt precept which he
gave to others, <hi>That he who would
not labour, ſhould not eat.</hi> He might
by the right of a ſpiritual Miniſter,
demand of thoſe he inſtructed,
things neceſſary for the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his life. <hi>For, who is that
Souldier (as he himſelf ſaies) that
fights at his own coſt, and does not
receive pay of him, for whom he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
his life? What Sheepheard
lookes to a flock, and watches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for
their preſervation, that has not right
to feed on their Milke, and to cloath
himſelf with their Wool?</hi> But all that
was permitted, ſeemed not to him
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:170075:82"/>
expedient to do, he would take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from the enemies of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell;
all manner of pretexts, that
they ſhould not accuſe him of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
his own intereſt or making a
Commerce of his preaching. He
would preſerve this glory to have
announced the Goſpell gratis to
them, &amp; by that means might ſpeak
with more liberty. Many ſpiritual
directours ought to conſider this
great example of diſingagement, &amp;
if they imitate it with prudence, and
courage, their conduct would be
more honourable to them, more
profitable to thoſe whom they go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern,
and more advantagious to
the honour of the Church.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle eſteemed not this
corporal exerciſe, to be any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
to his condition, ſince it
did not any way hinder him from
his times of prayer, or from the
Function of his Miniſtry. Every
Sabboth day he preached in the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:170075:83"/>
Synagogue of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and made
it appear to them, as well as to
the <hi>Greekes,</hi> that Jeſus Chriſt was
the true Meſſias, and true God,
<hi>Silas</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi> being come from
<hi>Theſalonica,</hi> he found himſelf more
then uſually moved by the Spirit
of God to ſpeak; his zeal was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindled
a new, and he preached
with more efficacy to thoſe of his
Nation the Divinity of his Maſter.
But when he perceived, that inſtead
of profiting by his words, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
more obſtinate, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
more horrible blaſphemies
againſt Jeſus Chriſt, he ſhaked his
garments, and told them, <hi>Your
blood be upon your own heads, I have
my hands clean, and I will goe from
this Country, and carry to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
this light which you refuſe.</hi> This
familiar faſhion of ſpeech to the
<hi>Hebrewes,</hi> was as much as to ſay,
that he had done all that lay in
him, to bring them to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:170075:83"/>
of the truth, and they would
not believe him, therefore he
ſhould not be reſponſable for their
perdition which was infallible.
At the ſame inſtant he changed his
lodging, and retired himſelf to
lodge with an honeſt man called
<hi>Titus Juſtus,</hi> one who feared God,
whoſe houſe was neer to the place,
where the <hi>Jewes</hi> uſed to aſſemble.
<hi>Criſpus</hi> who was Prince of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue,
imbraced the Goſpell,
and all his family, and many more
of the City were alſo baptized.
This good ſucceſs gave incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the Apoſtle, and to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it, our Saviour appeared to
him in a viſion; ſaying, <hi>Fear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
ſpeak boldly, take heed you
hold not your peace, for I am with you,
and none ſhall be able to hurt you,
I have many people in this Town.</hi> The
event made him know the truth of
this revelation. He remained
eighteen moneths in <hi>Corinth,</hi> and
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:170075:84"/>
in that time the Church was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
increaſed by the converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of divers perſons of all ſorts.
He preached continually, and in
the firſt Epiſtle which he wrote af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
to them, he ſhews, that in
declaring the Goſpel to them, <hi>He
made no uſe of the flowers of humane
eloquence, nor arguments of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
for fear they might extinguiſh
the vertue of the Croſs; which wants
not the art of words to perſwade the
belief of it. He puts them in minde
that he exerciſed his Miniſtry amongſt
them, with fear, and with humility, and
that he pretended to know no other
thing but Jeſus Chriſt crucified, that
he did not feed them with ſolid meat,
but with milke, becauſe they were
not capable of other nouriſhment.</hi> We
know not the particular things
which he did at <hi>Corinth,</hi> nor what
he endured there for the name of
Jeſus Chriſt. He onely ſayes that
the marks of his Apoſtleſhip a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:170075:84"/>
the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were many
paines, which he ſuffered with a
long patience, and that many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
were wrought in confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his Doctrine.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> who were never weary
of perſecuting him, found notin<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>Gallion</hi> the Proconſul of <hi>Achaya,</hi>
and Brother of <hi>Seneca</hi> the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,
a Spirit that would eaſily
imbrace the injuſtice of their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions:
to him they preſented the
Apoſtle, and accuſed him of
teaching a religious worſhip con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to their Law. But no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
the accuſed offered to open his
mouth in his own defence, when
<hi>Gallion</hi> told them, that if they
would complain of any evil acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he had committed, he would
hear, and do them juſtice; but if
it onely concerned ſome contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies
of their Religion, he would
not meddle in it, but leave the
Judgement of it to themſelves.
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:170075:85"/>
With this anſwer he diſmiſſed
them. And they in a fury fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Soſthenes</hi> Prince of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue,
who was a Chriſtian, nor
did the Conſul hinder them from
the proſecution of that inſolent
cruelty. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> makes menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this <hi>Soſihenes,</hi> in the ſaluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi>
and ſpeaks of him, as of
his Companion, which ſhewes he
was conſiderable, both to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle,
and to that Church which
he had care to inſtruct; it may be
alſo from him that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
of their diſorders, which
obliged him to write unto them.
Some Authors make him Biſhop of
<hi>Colophone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apoſtle applied not himſelf
ſo much to the ſalvation of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of <hi>Corinth,</hi> that he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat
the other Churches, and when
he underſtood the neceſſities of the
Church of <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> he wrote
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:170075:85"/>
two Epiſtles to them in a ſhort
time one after another. His de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne
in the firſt Epiſtle, was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
the faithful in the profeſſion
of the Goſpel, and to inſtruct them
in the myſtery of the Reſurrection,
to the end they might take courage
in their preſent and future perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions.
He commended them
for having made ſo great a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
in faith, the report whereof
was ſpread every where, and that
they ſerved for an example to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Churches. Afterwards he
puts them in minde of his manner
of preaching, how free it was from
any ſelf-intereſt, never conſenting
to be any burthen to them. He
expreſſes to them a great deſire to
ſee them again, and aſſures them
that he continually remembers
them in his Prayers. He exhorts
them not to be ſad for the death of
their Parents, or Friends, as the
Gentiles are, who doe not believe
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:170075:86"/>
the happineſs of a future life, nor
have any hope to be rejoyned unto
them again: That the death of
Chriſtians is but as it were a ſleep,
that Jeſus Chriſt, who is their
head, being riſen again, they who
are his members ſhall alſo riſe at
the laſt day at the voice of the
Arch-Angel, and at the-ſound of
a Trumpet they ſhall be lifted up
in the Aire, and goe before our
Lord, who ſhall come in his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to pronounce the laſt ſentence
of eternall happineſs, or eternall
miſery to men: that his Elect ſhall
follow him into Heaven, where
they ſhall live eternally with him
in an unſpeakable felicity. Many
not comprehending well that
which he ſayed of this laſt Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
conceived ſtrange fears,
which were increaſed by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence
or malice of ſome falſe
Doctors, who preached that this
laſt day was neer at hand. This
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:170075:86"/>
cauſed him to write unto them a
ſecond Epiſtle to diſſipate thoſe
fears which troubled them, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
them againſt thoſe perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which they then ſuffered, and
againſt ſuch as might ſtill befall
them. He told them of ſignes which
ſhould preceed the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
as firſt, a general Apoſtacy,
that is, the abandoning of the true
worſhip of God; Secondly, the
appearance of Antichriſt, whom he
calls the man of ſinne, becauſe he
ſhall be the greateſt of all ſinners,
and ſhall draw almoſt all men to
ſin, and to the greateſt ſin which
can be committed. If Heretick,
who ſay that the Pope is Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,
would ſeriouſly conſider the
portrature of him, as the Apoſtle
ſets him forth in this Epiſtle, they
would finde it very little Cohae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
with him, and would be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed
to believe ſo ridiculous a
dream, which the wiſeſt and moſt
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:170075:87"/>
learned amongſt them with reaſon
doe make but a jeſt.</p>
               <p>Thus did Saint <hi>Paul</hi> labour for
the glory of Jeſus Chriſt, both
with his tongue, and pen, at the
ſame time, and did not let ſlip
one minute of time whileſt he was
at <hi>Corinth,</hi> which he imployed,
not in the Functions of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry.
He departed thence, having
ſtaied there eighteen moneths with
<hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla</hi> his hoſts, but
before he left <hi>Corinth</hi> he ſhaved his
head, for ſome reaſon which Saint
<hi>Luke</hi> does not mention no more
then he does the vow which he
made to let his hair grow. For
the better underſtanding this
place in the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles;</hi> I
will tell you as it were in paſſing
by, that in the ancient Law, there
were two ſorts of <hi>Nazareans,</hi> that
is to ſay, men ſeparated, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated
to God. The one of them
were perpetual, and the other, but
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:170075:87"/>
for a certain time, according as
their devotion invited them to
make this vow; both the one, and
the other, were obliged to abſtain
from Wine, and from any other
Liquour that might cauſe drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and to let their hair grow.
The time allotted for the vow of
theſe latter being expired, they
were to preſent themſelves at the
door of the Tabernacle where they
offered the ſacrifice which was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
for it. They were ſhaved,
and their hair was burnt in the
fire of the Sacrifice of Pacifical Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
with many ceremonies,
which are ſet down in the Book
of <hi>Numbers.</hi> Now in the time of
their Conſecration, if they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
to contract any pollution
contrary to the law, either by
the touch of ſome dead body, or
that by change any died ſuddainly
in their preſence, they were bound
at the ſame inſtant to begin to
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:170075:88"/>
ſhave their hair, to finiſh it the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
day, and on the eighth day
to offer the ſacrifice, ordained for
their purification. I therefore
eaſily believe that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
made this vow of the <hi>Nazare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
to comply in ſome occaſions
with the weakneſs of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> as
he had circumciſed <hi>Timothy,</hi> to the
end he might not ſcandalize them,
or for ſome other reaſon which St.
<hi>Luke</hi> does not mention, might by
chance have met ſome dead Corps,
or touched ſome dead body; and
this having happened in the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of ſome <hi>Jews,</hi> who were conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and obſerved the Ceremonies of
the Law; he ſhaved his hair at
that inſtant, remitting his offering
ſacrifice till he came to <hi>Hieruſalem</hi>
as in effect he did, by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
of Saint <hi>James</hi> and the Prieſts
of that Church, which we ſhall
ſee in the Sequel of this Hiſtory.
It is true ſome Authors ſay that
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:170075:88"/>
                  <hi>Aquila</hi> made this vow, and not
the Apoſtle: But Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi>
and Saint <hi>Auguſtine, Bede,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
all Interpreters, maintain
that it ought to be underſtood of
Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and I have in this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the common opinion.</p>
               <p>The Sea favouring Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
he arrived ſafe at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
went into the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue
of the <hi>Jews</hi> to declare the
Goſpell unto them. They ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
deſired him to ſtay ſome
time with them, but he told them
he could not, deſiring to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
the Feaſt of Pentecoſt at <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi>
but if it pleaſed God he
would return to ſee them. He
went a Ship-board, and the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
being favourable, landed at
<hi>Ceſarea</hi> in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> from whence
(according as ſome interpret the
Book of the <hi>Acts)</hi> he went up to
<hi>Hieruſalem.</hi> He onely ſaluted the
Church of this City, and ſo went
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:170075:89"/>
to <hi>Antioch</hi> of <hi>Syria.</hi> There he
made his aboad ſome time, and
having there given order in that
which he thought neceſſary, he
went to viſit the Churches of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latia</hi>
and <hi>Phrygia,</hi> where he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
the faithful in their faith by
admirable diſcourſes, and by new
miracles</p>
               <p>At the end of this Voyage, which
laſted at the leaſt a yeare, he came
back to <hi>Epheſus.</hi> This City was
very famous by reaſon of <hi>Diana's</hi>
Temple, which was accounted in
the number of the ſeven Wond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the World. <hi>Aſia</hi> built
it in two Ages by a general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution,
and it was a place cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary
for the Kings, Princes,
and people of the Eaſt; but <hi>Nero,</hi>
who ſeemed to be borne for the
ruine of all noble things, plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
all the riches of it; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Empire of <hi>Galienus,</hi> the
<hi>Goths</hi> entirely ruined it. The Idol
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:170075:89"/>
of <hi>Diana</hi> was made of the wood
of <hi>Vines;</hi> and the Prieſts, making
uſe of the peoples ſimplicity,
brought them eaſily to beleeve that
it was deſcended from Heaven. The
like thing was beleeved at <hi>Rome</hi> of
a Buckler, which for that cauſe
was kept with great care. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
found at <hi>Epheſus</hi> twelve
Diſciples, who were onely bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with the Baptiſme of <hi>John,</hi>
and had never heard the Holy
Ghoſt once ſpoken of. Some Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
beleeve that they had been
inſtructed by this <hi>Apollo,</hi> who came
a little before to <hi>Epheſus;</hi> and of
whom Saint <hi>Luke</hi> ſpeaking, ſayes,
<hi>He was an eloquent man, and very well
verſed in the holy Scriptures; that he
knew the Doctrine of our Saviour, and
preached Jeſus Chriſt with great fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of ſpirit; but that he knew no
other Baptiſme then that of</hi> John,
which is to ſay in my opinion, that
as yet he had onely received that
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:170075:90"/>
Baptiſm. <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla</hi> fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
him ſo well diſpoſed, taught
him more particularly the verities
of the Goſpel, which he preſently
declared to thoſe of <hi>Corinth,</hi> where
he confounded the <hi>Jewes</hi> by the
force of his diſcourſe, and by the
authority of holy Scriptures which
he officaciouſly alledged to ſhew
them that Jeſus Chriſt was the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias.
For my part, I believe that
he and the others alſo of whom
we ſpeak, received their baptiſme
at the hands of Saint <hi>John</hi> himſelfe
in <hi>Judea.</hi> For it is certain, that
onely the Precurſor did baptiſe,
and after him, this baptiſme was
not practiſed as a thing neceſſary
for thoſe who believed in Jeſus
Chriſt. <hi>However it was, Saint</hi> Paul
<hi>teaches his Diſciples that he found in</hi>
Epheſus, John <hi>to have baptiſed the
people with a baptiſme of pennance, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deining
them to believe in him, who
was to come after him, and to whoſe
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:170075:90"/>
faith he prepared them by this exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
Ceremony, intended to mind them
of their uncleanneſs, and what neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
there was of an interiour parifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which could not be done but by
that Lamb which takes away the
ſinnes of the World; in fine he tells
them that the baptiſme of Jeſus Chriſt
is a renovation of the ſoul, by which
ſhe ſhakes off the Old Man, to cloath
her ſelfe with the New, that all thoſe
who received it, were thereby interred
with Chriſt, and as they had part in
his death, they ſhould alſo ſhare in
his Reſurrection; if as Chriſt, being
once dead, dies no more, they ſhall
likewiſe being once delivered from the
yoak of ſin, and there dead in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,
commit ſin no more.</hi> This diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
prepared them with holy
diſpoſitions to enter into that ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial
bath. They received holy
baptiſme, and the holy Ghoſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
upon them, rendered them
Prophets, and made them ſpeak un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:170075:91"/>
tongues; the Apoſtle deſirous
to gain all the other Inhabitants,
and principally the <hi>Jewes,</hi> went to
their Synagogues every Sabbath
for the ſpace of three moneths, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
unto them by invinſible
reaſons, and with an undanted
courage, the truth of the Doctrine
he preached. But, though he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
them all, yet he gained few
of them, many remaining obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
and perverſe, even to the
blaſpheming of Jeſus Chriſt, which
obliged this faithful ſervant of his,
to ſeparate himſelf from amongſt
them, together with thoſe Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
who believed and were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
by his diſcourſe. He choſe
for the place of his preaching, the
School of a <hi>Sophiſter</hi> called <hi>Tyrannus,</hi>
either becauſe he was converted to
the faith, or perhaps God had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
him to afford this civility
to his Apoſtle. For the ſpace of
three years he omitted not a day
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:170075:91"/>
to teach the Goſpell, in ſo much
as all <hi>Aſia</hi> received theſe delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
tydings, God confirming his
words by divers miracles, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
touch alone of his Handchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieffs,
and Girdles healed the
ſick, and drove the Divels out of
bodies tormented by them. A
man named <hi>Sceva,</hi> (in the <hi>Acts</hi> he
is called Prince of the Prieſts) had
ſeven Sons, who made profeſſion
of being Exorciſts, and paſſed up
and down for ſuch, perſwading
ſimple people (to get money from
them) that they knew the ſecret of
caſting forth Divels. When they
beheld the command which Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> exerciſed over Divels, and
that the Divels could not reſiſt
him, whether out of Emulation,
or Covetouſneſs, they would needs
exerciſe a poſſeſt perſon in the
name of Jeſus, whom <hi>Paul</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
The Divel, who was a very
cruel one, anſwered them, that
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:170075:92"/>
he knew Jeſus Chriſt and <hi>Paul,</hi> but
for them, he ſcorned their Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſmes,
and flew upon them with
that violence, as they were forced
to ſave themſelves by flight out of
the houſe naked, and much woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
This accident comming to
the knowledge of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and
<hi>Gentils,</hi> that dwelt at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> much
aſtoniſhed them, and made them
highly to honour the name of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt. Many amongſt the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
were ſeized with a holy feare,
which made them confeſs publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
their miſdeeds. It is obſerved
in Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> that thoſe who
went to preſent themſelves to the
Baptiſme of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> confeſſed
their ſinnes; and, in my opinion,
one paſſage explicates the other.
Saint <hi>Luke</hi> ſeemes alſo to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
the firſt from thoſe others,
whereupon he ſayes, that they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
the errour and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of Magick; to the which
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:170075:92"/>
they were much addicted, burnt
all their wicked Books; and there
were ſo many of them, and thoſe
ſo rare, as they were valued at a
vaſt ſum of money.</p>
               <p>It is not to be wondred at, for
<hi>Epheſus</hi> at all times was much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
to Magick. Characters were
there ſold to obtaine victory in
their publick games. <hi>Suidas</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,
how an <hi>Epheſian</hi> at the Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick
Games, overcame 30. Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions
at wreſtling; that a <hi>Mileſian</hi>
trying with him, and no odds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
betwixt them, the Judges
doubted that he had characters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him, as indeed they found,
and taking them away, he was eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
overcome. <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſayes, that by
the name <hi>Epheſian,</hi> Devils were caſt
out of bodies which they poſſeſt.
<hi>Euſtathius</hi> obſerves, that there were
writings about the feet, middle,
and crown of the Statue of <hi>Diana.
Apollonius Thianeus</hi> accompliſhed
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:170075:93"/>
the corruption of this great City,
for he taught Magick publiquely,
and was ſo honoured there, that
they erected him a Statue, as unto
a God. The happy progreſs of the
Goſpel there was ſtopped by great
perſecutions, raiſed by the rage of
the <hi>Iewes</hi> againſt the Apoſtle. Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> he ſayes,
<hi>The toyle he there underwent, was
ſuch, as life became wearyſome to him;
and that he had fought againſt wilde
beaſts:</hi> But I conceive this ought to
be underſtood Allegorically, and
not literally; wicked and cruel
men being ordinarily in the Holy
Scriptures termed wild and furious
beaſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Demetrius</hi> well deſerves this
name. This man was a Goldſmith
by profeſſion, and had great
trading in workes of ſilver which
the <hi>Gentiles</hi> offered to <hi>Diana.</hi> Some
ſay they were Images, and others,
little Temples of the falſe Goddeſs
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:170075:93"/>
in the form of the great one. He
ſeeing, that by the preaching of St.
<hi>Paul,</hi> his gain with Idolatry day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
decayed, aſſembles all the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
that wrought under him,
who were many, and told them,
<hi>They were now in danger to be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
unto great miſery; for</hi> Paul <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
in his Sermons, that Idols made
by the hands of men had no under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
much leſs any Divinity in
them; and this Doctrin once received,
they ſhould not be able to get their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.
They muſt leave their trade,
and that Temple of</hi> Diana, <hi>which</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,
<hi>and other Provinces of the world
adored, ran a great hazard ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be deprived of Reputation and
Sacrifices.</hi> Theſe reaſons, in which
they were concerned, put them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
fury. They running about the
ſtreets like mad men, cryed, <hi>Great
is</hi> Diana <hi>of Epheſus,</hi> to ſee if they
could excite the people to ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and unluckily meeting with
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:170075:94"/>
                  <hi>Gaius</hi> and <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> both <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi>
and preſently remembring
them to be companions of Saint
<hi>Paul,</hi> whom they ſought, they
dragged them to the Theatre, to
expoſe them to the fury of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
The Apoſtle hearing of the
danger they were in, would have
gone unto them, but his diſciples
and ſome others of quality of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi>
that loved him, hindered it,
and repreſented to him the danger
he would run to be ill treated by
ſuch a multitude in commotion.
The <hi>Jewes</hi> were no leſſe afraid then
the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> becauſe in this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
there was no difference made
betwixt them, they being no leſſe
enemies to Idolatry then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
So to prevent the danger
which threatned them, they ſent to
the Theatre one of theirs, called
<hi>Alexander,</hi> to ſee if he could ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe
the people, and ſtop the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe
which might ariſe from that
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:170075:94"/>
ſedition. He a long time made
ſigne with his hand that he had
ſomething to ſpeak unto them: But
when the ſeditious called to minde
he was a <hi>Jew,</hi> they made a greater
noiſe then before, and for two hours
ſpace ceaſed not to cry out, <hi>Great
is</hi> Diana <hi>of the Epheſians.</hi> At laſt,
a Magiſtrate being there, behaved
himſelfe ſo well, as he appeaſed
the people, and ſpake in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to them. <hi>O Epheſians! who is
ignorant that knowes not how faithfully
your City adores the great</hi> Diana,
<hi>daughter of</hi> Jupiter, <hi>together with
her Image, ſent downe from Heaven,
and in this worſhip we ſurpaſs all the
people of the Earth; nor is there in
the world any thing comparable to the
glory of her Temple. All Nations ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
this; and theſe things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
without diſpute, you need not fear
any can attempt againſt the honour of
that Divinity which you ſerve, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
take heed you undertake nothing
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:170075:95"/>
raſhly. It is certaine, theſe men whom
you have brought hither to deſtroy, are
not guilty of any blaſphemy againſt
your Goddeſs. Wherefore if</hi> Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius,
<hi>and thoſe of his trade which
follow him, have any diſpute with them,
why ſhould you, for their particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
make this a generall cauſe?
Are there not perſons ordained to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide
cauſes, and Magiſtrates who have
power, and ought to determine ſuch
differences? But if there be queſtion
of any other thing, you muſt remit the
clearing of it to a lawfull Aſſemby, and
not treat of it in this, which ſeemes to
be altogether ſeditious. Conſider there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
well, that we are reſponſable for
the evill which may happen upon this,
and we run the hazard to be accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
of ſedition, ſince we can give no
good account of this dayes tumult.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This diſcourſe appeaſed the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and happily ſaved the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of the Apoſtle, who took re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
to leave this City, that he
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:170075:95"/>
might execute his former deſign of
viſiting the Churches of <hi>Achaia,
Macedonia,</hi> and goe to <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi>
from whence he propoſed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to goe to <hi>Rome;</hi> but without
doubt in another manner then we
ſhall ſee him conducted thither. He
left his dearly beloved <hi>Timothy</hi> to
governe the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi>
whom <hi>Euſebius</hi> will have to be the
firſt Biſhop of that place.</p>
               <p>He remained with them near
three years; and during that time,
<hi>Apollo,</hi> of whom we have ſpoken,
came to <hi>Corinth</hi> to preach the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,

too much heat, inſomuch as
their Church began to be in ſome
danger of Schiſme, the ſequel
whereof might have proved very
dangerous. Beſides this diſorder,
there was a man amongſt them,
who had abuſed the wife of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
They differed alſo much in
opinions about the uſe of meates
offered to Idols; and there was
ſome abuſe in the banquets which
they call <hi>Agapes,</hi> that is to ſay, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable,
where they took irreverent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

for it was neither out of the heat

of the Church, and to ſave him,
whom for a time it was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to put into the hands of the
Devil, to the end he might not for
ever remain ſo. He rebukes the
<hi>Corinthians,</hi> who by their bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in Law-Sutes diſhonoured the
name of Jeſus Chriſt. And told
them, <hi>It was very ill done to plead
one againſt another; but much worſe,
and more conſiderrable, to doe it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Judges who were Idolaters. That
they ought rather to chooſe the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
perſons of the Church to accord
their differences, who would be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:170075:97"/>
enough to judge of ſuch temporall
things, the Faithfull being onely to
judge the World and the Devils. He
put them in minde, that before Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme
they were ſoyled with abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ordures, but by their ſpiritual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation,
they were become the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of God, and the members of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt; therefore this glorious qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
obliged them to be pure, and
that their bodies were not given to
ſerve fornication, it being not their
part to diſpoſe of them, but our Lord,
and that God would raiſe them again.
He inſtructs married people alſo, to
uſe marriage as a holy thing, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
them to ſeparate themſelves, that
they may be vacant in prayer, which
he means ſhould be done but for a term
of time, and then to return to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugall
ſociety, as an innocent remedy
againſt incontinence. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
he proteſts that he permits it them
by indulgence, becauſe the ſeverity of
Chriſtian Lawes in marriage allow
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:170075:97"/>
the uſe of it onely for the generation of
children; but mans infirmity requires
it, that he might reſiſt temptations;
ſo that</hi> (as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hath
ſince ſaid) <hi>the ſanctity of Nuptials
render pardonable that which proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appertains not to marriages. From
this Subject he paſſes to treat of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity,
which he councels by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
and by reaſon, in that it does
perfectly withdraw one from the tye
of creatures, and cares of the World.</hi>
Thoſe who are of opinion that S.
<hi>Paul</hi> was married, ſhould doe well
to blot out the words he ſets down
in this Epiſtle, if they will defend
ſo new, and ill grounded an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
Notwithſtanding, he leaves
this Angelical, rather then humane
forme of life, under the bare terms
of Counſel, and proteſts there is
no precept of our Lord for it; that
he onely counſels it, as believing it
better, and of more advantage to
the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> He exhorts Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:170075:98"/>
to continue in their widow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood;
and if they cannot keep the
purity of that ſtate, to eſpouſe
themſelves to our Lord; that is to
ſay, with a Chriſtian intention,
and with ſuch as believe in Jeſus
Chriſt, and not for ſenſuality. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
meats offered to Idols, he
teaches them, that the uſe is indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
in it ſelf, but yet they ought
to abſtain from them, leſt the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
people, who conceive them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden,
ſhould be ſcandalized to
ſee them eaten; and they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
may thereby take occaſion
to eat them after a ſuperſtitious
manner. To confirme this Docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he repreſents unto them,
<hi>That in delivering them the Geſpel,
he would not ſuffer them to furniſh
him with neceſſaries for his ſubſiſtence,
although he had right to receive, nay
indeed to require it. That he ſeemed
to be a</hi> Jew <hi>amongſt the</hi> Jewes, <hi>and
not to obſerve the Law amongſt thoſe
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:170075:98"/>
that knew not the Law. In fine, that
he made himſelfe all things to all, to
gaine all men to God.</hi> But there is
nothing he reproves with ſo much
fervour, as the irreverence which
they committed, before their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
to the Holy Table. He
ſhewes the inſtitution of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt,
and ſayes, <hi>That as often as we
eat it, we announce the death of our
Lord untill his comming again;</hi> that
is to ſay, this Sacrament is the
lively commemoration of the
death of Jeſus Chriſt; and ſo a
participation of his body and
blood offered upon the Croſs. He
concludes, <hi>That he who drinks and
eats this unworthily, is guilty of the
body and bloud of our Lord;</hi> which
is to ſay, he defiles the moſt holy
thing under Heaven, and upon
Earth. He participates in the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of thoſe Executioners that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened
him to the Croſs. He cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifies
him after a more outragious
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:170075:99"/>
manner, prophaning a Myſtery
wherein he is to be adored, and
placing him in a heart corrupted
with ſin, as if he were at the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of his enemies, and ſtill carried
about him the likeneſs of ſin; he
who lives by the life of God, and
reſides in the boſome of his Father.
Hence he commands them diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to examine themſelves, before
they eat of this heavenly bread,
and drink of this holy cup, leſt,
being not well prepared, they drink
and eat their judgement; that is
to ſay, receive Jeſus Chriſt as a
Judge, whom they intend to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
as a Phyſitian, and make it
the food of death, which ought to
be a nouriſhment of life. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
if thoſe who goe ſo ſlightly to
the holy Communion, and who
ſeem to fear a too exact diſcuſſion,
would attentively conſider the
words and threats which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
fulminates in this behalfe,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:170075:99"/>
they would be more wary. They
would be ſeized with a benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
apprehenſion, and eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
that our diſpoſitions to a
worthy receiving cannot be too
pure; and conſequently, thoſe who
communicate, cannot be too exact;
that ſeverity, in this affair, is leſs
dangerous, then any compliance
or remiſneſs. It were to be wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that Chriſtians would commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
every day, as they did in
the Infancy of the Church; but
then their lives ſhould be alſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable
to thoſe Faithful of the
Primitive times. It is very good
often to participate thereof; but
then we muſt make our profit by
that participation; for the Table
of our Lord cannot be joyned with
that of Devils; that is to ſay,
the uſe of the body of the Son of
God, cannot conſiſt with the love
of vanity, greatneſs, and pleaſures
of the world, which are enemies
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:170075:100"/>
to the Sonne of God. Theſe ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reverences
of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> which
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> mentions, were but
ſlight; it was onely ſome exceſs of
drinking and eating in the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
where they communicated.
What wonld he have ſaid, if he had
found them full of impurity, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
vanity, and ambition? In
his Epiſtle, after he had regulated
thoſe things of moſt importance,
he ſets down alſo how they ſhould
employ their free-graces, as the
gift of ſpeaking al ſorts of tongues,
of interpreting holy Scriptures, of
foretelling things to come, and
ſuch like. That he would have
the rule of their actions to be the
the glory of God, and the good
of their Neighbour, and to the
end they might love that Charity
which he teaches them; he makes
an admirable diſcription of it,
whence it appears his heart did
perfectly poſſeſſe that which he ſet
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:170075:100"/>
forth with ſo much grace and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy.
Towards the end of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle,
he treats of the great myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Reſurrection, of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of a new life after the end of
the world, of the new raign of God
over Jeſus Chriſt, and over the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
of his ineffable reſiding in
them, by the which he ſhall be all
things to them. He explicates to
the ignorant the Reſurrection, by
compariſon of a grain of Corne,
which reſts in the earth where it is
ſowed, and afterwards ſprings up
and produces many ears of Corne,
nay ears of another kinde, then
the grain from whence they come,
the Corne being ſowed without
thoſe coverings of ſtraw, and the
ears comming together with the
ſtraw, the which he applies to the
difference of the ſtate of a body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
and after Reſurrection. He
explicates this myſtery which ſo
much care, that he might correct
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:170075:101"/>
the errors of <hi>Cerinthus</hi> and <hi>Baſili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi>
the one of them teaching that
Jeſus Chriſt was not ſeen againe,
and the other, that men ſhould not
riſe again after death.</p>
               <p>This explication of the Doctrin
of the firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
in my opinion will not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
to the Reader. But now
let us return to the courſe of our
narration, and follow Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> which he traverſed
all over, and carefully left not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Church unviſited, to confirme
there the faithful in the Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Doctrine: After that, he took
the way to <hi>Greece</hi> by Sea, and in
the courſe of his Voyage, eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Titus</hi> his beloved Diſciple Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of the Iſle of <hi>Creet,</hi> now cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Candia.</hi> The cuſtomes there
obſerved were ſo infamous; luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and other vices, abounded there
with ſo much impudency, as a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
no leſſe vigilant and couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:170075:101"/>
then he, was neceſſary to abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
them, and eſtabliſh their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
vertues. The Apoſtle before
his departure, gave him profitable
Documents, and ſoon after wrote
unto him excellent inſtructions
how to diſcharge well the duties
of his Epiſcopacy. From <hi>Nicopolis</hi>
where he paſſed the winter, he ſent
a ſecond Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
in which he takes off the Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,
he had thundered out
in his firſt againſt inceſtuous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
who had ſo much ſcandalized
the Church. He treats principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the dignity of the Miniſters
of the New Teſtament, and of the
patience which they ought to
have in their tribulations. Hee
ſeems to praiſe himſelfe much in
the eleventh Chapter, where he
ſpeaks of himſelf, of his pains, and
of his patience, in termes contrary
to the humility of an Apoſtle. It
is true according to the ordinary
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:170075:102"/>
rules of humane wiſdom, tis odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to praiſe ones ſelfe, and they
are accuſed commonly of impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
that do it, not bluſhing to
ſpeak thoſe things of themſelves,
which they would bluſh to heare
another ſpeak. It is a kinde of
uſurpation, by which we take away
from thoſe who are witneſſes of
our actions, the liberty of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them, and giving teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the eſteem which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.
For this reaſon the wiſe
man in the Proverbs advertiſeth
the Prince whom he formes, and all
other men, not to fall into this
error. <hi>Let a ſtranger,</hi> ſaith he,
praiſe thee, <hi>and not thine own Mouth.</hi>
Notwithſtanding it is certain there
are occaſions, when according to
the rules of Divine and Humane
wiſdom, it is not onely permitted,
but neceſſary for one to praiſe
himſelf without offending modeſty
or giving any cauſe of reprehenſion,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:170075:102"/>
more then in telling other truths.
To praiſe ones ſelfe to be praiſed,
is a ſhameful ambition. To praiſe
ones ſelfe to rob others of praiſe,
is an envy full of baſeneſs. But
if one praiſe himſelf, either in a
juſt defence of his carriage againſt
calumny, or for the good of ſuch
as we are obliged to anſwer for
before God, or to diſcredit thoſe
who make ill uſe of their reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
or for the glory of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery
which is impoſed upon us:
In ſuch occaſions, I ſay, when one
praiſes himſelf, he ſinnes neither
againſt wiſedome, nor modeſty,
but does that which is juſt. The
great men of former Ages have u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
it in this manner; and to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
no examples but ſacred: Doc
we not ſee that <hi>Job</hi> in his Book
makes as well a Panegyrick of his
patience, as a Story of his miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries?
<hi>David,</hi> in many of the
<hi>Pſalmes,</hi> does he not ſet forth the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:170075:103"/>
innocency of his hands; the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of his heart; his zeale for the
houſe of God; his juſtice and his
benignity? Now if any one ever
had cauſe to imitate theſe great
patterns in this holy liberty, it
was without doubt Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in
the Epiſtle we ſpeak of; for in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
the Miniſter, and the ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of his intentions, he defended
the authority of his Miniſtery, and
the verity of thoſe things which he
had preached to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
new Converts, 'tis neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to prevent the contemning of
their Maſter, leſt it ſhould paſs to
the contemning of his Doctrine;
and falſe Apoſtes may corrupt their
faith, by a vaine opinion of their
Eloquence and Sanctity. The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of Jeſus Chriſt was intereſſed
in him, whom he had choſen to
preach his Goſpel to them, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whom he had heaped ſo many
extraordinary favours. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:170075:103"/>
alſo was of great danger
to the Churches which he had
founded, and was to found; for
upon falſe rumors, the ſincerity of
his intentions might be brought in
doubt, and other Preachers of the
Goſpel might ſeem more conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.
Though theſe reaſons might
juſtifie the manner of his ſpeaking
of himſelf, yet he does it with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
precautions; as ſometimes in
that ſame Chapter he names him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
a ſenceleſs man, and often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
pardon, excuſe, and to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
if he ſpeak not like a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
man; ſo that one may eaſily
judge, and diſcerne that his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
violenced his Modeſty; and,
that if he had followed the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of his heart, he had given leave
to his enemies, and thoſe that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyed
him, to triumph, leaving to
them the glory of Eloquence, and
opinion of Sanctity; the rule of
Conſciences, and other worldly
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:170075:104"/>
Preferments, to which they aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
reſerving onely to himſelfe
contempt, poverty, and an obſcure
life. You muſt alſo obſerve, that
after he had ſpoken of his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious
qualities, recounting his
Viſions and Extaſies, he acquaints
us with the temptation which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
hung upon him; nor did
the ſhame in confeſſing his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
hinder him from taking
notice of its violence, which
made him ſo ardently deſire
to be delivered from it; and
leſt the ſublimity of his revelations
might raiſe him too high, God (as
he himſelfe ſayes) ſent him this
Angel of Satan, who did buffet him
without intermiſſion; and leſt the
diſcourſes which he had made of
his Extraordinary Graces, ſhould
puff him up with vanity, or
might ſcandalize others, he would
deſcribe unto us the torments
which he ſuffered, and ſuch ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:170075:104"/>
ones, to the end that in the ſame
page both himſelf and the readers
might have a wholſome Antidote,
to preſerve the one from vanity,
and the others from ſcandal. I
know very well Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>
interprets the buffeting of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
of Satan, whereof he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines,
to be the afflictions which
he had ſuffered, and dayly did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
for the Goſpel. The tender
love which this excellent Father
bore to the Apoſtle, would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
him to believe, that in an Age
ſo far advanced in years, and in ſo
ſetled a vertue, there was any place
left for carnal temptations, which
he thought were needful onely to
keep common ſouls in humility &amp;
feare. Other Interpreters have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated
theſe words of his, to be
meant of ſome great paine of his
head, or ſome other infirmity. But
although I commend their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I cannot approve their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:170075:105"/>
nor follow their opinions;
but on the contrary, I gather by
this counterpoiſe the eminency of
his grace, and I admire the infinite
wiſedome of God in the conduct
of him, who on the one ſide lifted
him up to Heaven by raptures; and
on the other plunged him into
myre by thoſe ſtings of concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence,
to the end there might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in him the force of grace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued,
which he had experimented
in the beginning of his Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
It was alſo in his perſon, to
inſtruct all Miniſters of the Goſpel,
and likewiſe the reſt of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
not to be aſtoniſhed if they
feel the like temptations, when they
think themſelves abſolutely freed,
either through Age, or by a long
progreſs in vertue: And alſo hereby
we are taught, that during this life,
the ſoule cannot become ſo perfect,
but that there will remain always
ſomething of the <hi>Old Man</hi> which
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:170075:105"/>
cannot be deſtroyed but by little
and little, and that without the
omnipotent hand of God, there is
no ſanctity ſo ſolidly built, which
may not in an inſtant be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown;
and contrary wiſe by the
protection of the ſame hand, the
moſt violent aſſaults of the fleſh
are eaſily overcome. It is that
which makes all things turne to
the good of thoſe who are predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate:
It cures them by that which
might be thought would cauſe
ſickneſs: It enlightens them
by darkneſs, and purifies them by
impurity. I have a little enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
my ſelf upon theſe two points,
which I thought of importance,
both in defence of him whoſe life
I write, and for the inſtruction
of thoſe who ſhall read it. And
now let us returne to our Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Cenchrea,</hi> a Harbour of
<hi>Corinth,</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> directs his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:170075:106"/>
to the <hi>Romans,</hi> which ſo much
troubles Interpreters. It contains
the grounds of Chriſtian Religions
as, the corruption of nature by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal
ſin; the abſolute neceſſity
of the grace of Jeſus Chriſt; and
that ineffable Myſtery of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination
of ſome, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
of others, by the pure
will of God, to ſhew the treaſures
of his mercy, and the dreadful ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of his juſtice, in the different
lots of thoſe who are wrapped up
in the ſame maſs of corruption by
the firſt ſinne, and ſubject to one
and the ſame condemnation.
There is need of great light, but
more humility, to conceive the
profound diſcourſes of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
in this Epiſtle, knowing proud
men will finde there continuall
Rocks, and the ſimple, profitable
Doctrine, which teaches them, by
diſtruſting themſelves, to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to the protection of the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:170075:106"/>
grace of God. The Apoſtle does
there rather mention, then expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
the verities of Predeſtination,
and regards not whether humane
reaſon be ſatisfied, ſo Jeſus Chriſt
be honoured. It is a ſtrange error
(me thinks) to reject an opinion,
becauſe it is not eaſily explicated,
or comprehended, as if its facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to be underſtood, were a mark
of its truth; and that we ought to
ſatisfie the proud reaſon of man in
myſteries of Faith. If they be my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries,
they are obſcure, they are
ſealed up, and it belongs to the
Lamb, not to the raſh hands of men
to unſeale them. If Faith pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
them to us, our underſtanding
is there to be captivated; there
are depths which are not to be
ſounded; and where are the Abyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
and depths of Gods judgment
where the treaſures of his wiſdome
if Divine Verities may be explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in a humane way, and ſo that
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:170075:107"/>
the weakeſt underſtanding may
comprehend them, and the vanity
of our heart become perfectly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
in the power we have both
over our ſelves, and over the grace
of God, as if we were abſolute
Maſters of them? And he who has
made all that he pleaſed, both in
Heaven and Earth, could doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
he deſired in our will with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
wounding the liberty of it; he
(I ſay) who has created it free,
and who knowes beſt how it muſt
be moved? It is juſt we ſhould
be careful of our will, but
it is more reaſonable we ſhould be
careful of the honour and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of him that hath beſtowed it
upon us; and who, healing its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity,
contracted by ſin, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates
this liberality unto us
for the glory of his grace, and not
for the ſatisfaction of our vanity:
we muſt not ſtop at verity becauſe
it is harſh, and humbles our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:170075:107"/>
underſtanding; it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
that it is an Evangelical verity,
which will have us to captivate our

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>on to the yoak of Faith, and
will not ſuffer that man ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
himſelfe to have the greateſt
part in the work of his ſalvation.
The portion properly due to him,
is falſhood, and ſinne; and when
God crownes his good works with
the Crown of juſtice, 'tis after he
has given him thoſe good works
as the Father of mercies. We hold
of him both our will, and our act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
as he begins in us, 'tis fit he
ſhould proſecute, and bring to an
end the deſigns of grace and love,
which he ſets on foot for our eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
ſalvation.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle was reſolved to take
the way of <hi>Syria,</hi> but the <hi>Jewes</hi>
way-laying him, enforced him to
lengthen his journey, and to turn
back to paſs by <hi>Macedonia. Soſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pater,</hi>

the Myſteries of God. Upon a
Sunday towards Evening, the
faithful being aſſembled together to
receive the Euchariſt, he made them
a long diſcourſe, the which (if
we conſider his divine inſtructions)
we may ſuppoſe was much after
this manner.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>This action we have now in
hand fills me with joy beyond
expreſſion; for certainly our
Maſter could not leave us a better
teſtimony of his extream love,
then in giving this Bread which
we break, and this Cup which
we bleſs. For in eating the one,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:170075:108"/>
doe we not participate of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy?
and in drinking the other,
doe we not participate of his
bloud? And could he cloſe up
his life better then in the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this adorable Myſtery, by
which he continues amongſt men
to the end of the world? 'Tis he
himſelfe who has vouchſafed
to reveale unto me, that in that
night when <hi>Judas</hi> delivered him
into the hands of his enemies, he
took bread, and giving thankes
to his Father, brake it, and gave
it to his Apoſtles, ſaying to
them, <hi>Take and eat, this is my
Body, which ſhall be delivered up for
you. Doe this in remembrance of
me.</hi> Likewiſe he took the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
after he had ſupped, and ſaid,
<hi>This Chalice is the new Teſtament
in my bloud; Doe this in commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of me every time you drink
of it.</hi> So that as often as you eat
of this Bread, and drink of this
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:170075:109"/>
Chalice, you declare the death
of our Lord until his comming
again. But what doe you think
Commemoration is, and unto
what in your opinions does it
oblige you? I will tell you in
few words. You muſt not onely
call to minde the death of Jeſus
Chriſt, but you muſt make it
ſhine in your affections, in your
deſires, in your words, to be
brief in every paſſage of your
life. You muſt become Preachers
of the Croſs without ſpeaking,
and by the Sanctity of your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,
you muſt make that to be
honoured and loved, which to
the <hi>Gentiles</hi> is a folly, and to the
<hi>Jewes</hi> a ſcandal. If you be ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
with this Spirit, like per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
grafted on the Croſs of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, you will produce
fruits anſwerable to the root
from which you ſprung up. If
you hate the world, which the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:170075:109"/>
Croſs condemnes, and which the
Croſs ſhall one day judge: If
you have ſhame, ignominy, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,
poverty, hunger, thirſt,
torments, perſecution of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
diſpleaſure of Parents, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits
of Servants, treaſon of falſe
Brothers, All which are fruits
of the Croſs of Jeſus Chriſt. I
ſay, if you be thus diſpoſed, and
in the practiſe of theſe things,
then believe you are well prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to eat the bread of which I
ſpeak, and to thrive by its nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment.
But if contrarywiſe
you love the world, and are wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to Honours, Riches, Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
Pleaſures, and other
things of the Earth, either by
enjoying them, or by an inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
affection to them. In a word,
if you eat this bread unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
know that you are guilty of
high Treaſon againſt the Body
and Bloud of our Lord. God
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:170075:110"/>
will not have the Kings of the
Earth to be touched; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares,
that he will revenge their
injuries, becauſe they are his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed,
though onely by an
exteriour and material Unction.
How ſeverely then may ye think
he will puniſh thoſe who ſhall
pollute the Body and Bloud of
his Sonne, whom he has eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
King upon Mount <hi>Sion,</hi>
to command over all the Kings
of the Earth; and who is his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed
by the ineffable Uncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his Divinity which inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites
corporally in him. You
abhor thoſe Executioners who
faſtned him to the Croſs, pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
his feet and hands, ſpit in his
face, and crowned his head with
thornes. But if you approach
unworthily to his Table, to eat
his fleſh, and drink his bloud,
you are the greater offenders;
for they were Infidels, and took
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:170075:110"/>
him for a Criminal: But you
profeſs to believe in him, and
know that he is the Holy of God,
and the Source of the Sanctity of
men. Therefore try your ſelves
diligently, without flattering
your ſelves in your evil cuſtomes.
Make a ſtrict ſcrutiny againſt
your ſelves; enter into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
of your ſoule, to diſcerne
there the difference betwixt a
lively, and dead Faith; betwixt
a firme, and a faint languiſhing
hope; betwixt a true and a fein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Charity; betwixt your love of
Jeſus Chriſt, your love of
creatures, and your ſelves. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
this examine, doe
not think your ſelves ſo ſaintly
diſpoſed, as is requiſite to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
worthy of this heavenly
bread; for ſo long as we live in
this world, we cannot our ſelves
be free from many defects and
frailties. But there is a great deal
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:170075:111"/>
of difference betwixt faults
which ſpring againſt our will
from the corruption of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and the love of thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faults,
or our obſtinacy to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in wickedneſs. For I ſpeak
not here of dogs that live in
filth, and often turn to their vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
biting their neighbors with
their ſlandering tongues. I have
often told you, that netiher For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicators,
nor thoſe who commit
other villanies, which I will not
ſo much as name to you, nor
Theeves, nor covetous perſons,
nor envious, nor ſlanderous, nor
proud, ſhall enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Heaven. Now all thoſe
who are excluded from a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Kingdome, muſt be alſo
baniſhed from that which God
has upon Earth, that is, his
Church; and conſequently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of the food which he has
prepared to nouriſh his Spouſe
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:170075:111"/>
during her Pilgrimage; and
if they eat it, they ſhall eat their
judgement; the body of Jeſus
Chriſt ſhall enter into their
breaſts, and there engrave in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
undeleble the arreſt of
their death; and whileſt they
think to receive a pledge of their
ſalvation, it ſhall prove the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
of their damnation. For
they will be not onely guilty
perſons, but perſons already
condemned and adjudged to
death: and the ſeparation of
them from the Elect, ſhall be
juſtly grounded upon the litle di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
they made of the body
and bloud of the Sonne of God,
taking ordinary meat with more
care and circumſpection. Alas
there are but too many who are
guilty of this Sacriledge! Men
know them not; but they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
lye hid from God, who reads
their moſt ſecret thoughts, and
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:170075:112"/>
ſees clearly the evil diſpoſitions
of their carnal ſoules. We ſee
young men periſh in the flower
of their age; we behold ſtrong
and luſty men fall into languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
diſeaſes, of which we know
not the cauſe. Suddain death
dayly takes away divers perſons,
who, in reſpect of their age and
health, might have promiſed
themſelves a long life. Theſe
accidents are ordinarily attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to natural cauſes; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
it, 'tis a ſecret puniſhment
for the profanation of the body
of Jeſus Chriſt. Therefore judge
your ſelves, to the end you be
not judged. Yet be not ſeized
with ſo great a fear as to hinder
you from approaching to him,
who is as wel bread to ſtrengthen
the weak and fraile, as to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
the ſtrong; and is a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine,
as well as food. Eat day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of this bread; but then let
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:170075:112"/>
your life correſpond with your
food; and as the one is heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
let not the other ſavour of
the corruption of the Earth. As
you eat of the ſame bread, and
drink of the ſame cup at the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of your Father; ſo let there
be a perfect union in your deſires,
and in your thoughts, as to be
one thing. This bread, which
is made of many graines of corn,
and the wine which is drawne
from many grapes, teach you to
unite your hearts by charity.
You muſt be to one another as
one bread, by an amorous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
of your gifts, either
ſpiritual or temporal, that all
ſhadow of diviſion, even of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity,
may be baniſhed from
the Church. Goe on then, my
dear Brethren, in ſuch a manner
as may anſwer the Sanctity of
your name and vocation. You
are called Chriſtians, and this
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:170075:113"/>
name ſhewes your Royal Uncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Prieſthood together. You
are of that Kingly Stock; doe
not then make your ſelves ſlaves
of ſinne, which is the moſt infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
and cruel Maſter you can
chooſe. You are Prieſts, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
cloath your ſelves with ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.
Offer your ſelves to God
as a holy Hoſt, immaculate by
Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, who is
the Eternal Prieſt, by whom, and
in whom our oblations are made
acceptable to the heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
I behold here perſons of
all conditions; and therefore I
will briefly ſet down ſome rules
how to performe the duty of
Chriſtians: Husbands and Wives,
I would have you know that
marriage which has joyned you
together, is a great Sacrament
in Jeſus Chriſt and his Church.
It repreſents the adorable union
of the heavenly Eſpouſe; and
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:170075:113"/>
this Chaſte Bride, whom he has
purified from all uncleanneſs by
the word of life; ſo that ſhe who
before was black, and ſoyled in
the time of her diſorders, now
appears more white then Lilies,
without any ſpot or wrinckle to
diſhonour her. He has not onely
expreſſed his love to her by theſe
favours, but alſo given his life
for her, and made his bloud the
Seale of his love. Therefore
love your Wives after this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del,
and conſider their bodies as
a thing that is yours, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
ought to be the ſubject
of your care. But as the love
which Jeſus Chriſt beares to his
Church is pure; ſo let the
love which you bear to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
of your bed be likewiſe
pure. As Jeſus Chriſt beares
with the frailties of his Church;
ſo you muſt bear the infirmites of
thoſe, whoſe Sex being more
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:170075:114"/>
fraile, is more excuſable, and
may better claim to be ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
when you love them, you
love your ſelves, for marriage
makes that you are two in one
fleſh.</p>
                  <p>Wives, be you ſubject to your
husbands, as to thoſe who hold
the place of our Lord over you:
they are your heads, as Jeſus
Chriſt is head of the Church.
The head conducts the reſt of the
body, take them therefore for the
guides of your life, and repoſe
more truſt in their conduct, then
in that of your own reaſon. As
the Church is ſubject to the will
of Jeſus Chriſt, be you obedient
to the wills of your husbands;
never give them any cauſe of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
nor occaſion to diſtruſt you.
Think not of pleaſing any but
them, &amp; to that end adorn your
ſelves modeſtly, as <hi>Sarah</hi> did, and
thoſe holy women in times paſt,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:170075:114"/>
who were ſo carefull of gaining
the hearts of their husbands, as
they called them their Lords,
and were much more carefull in
the adorning of their ſouls then
bodies. Curled hair with affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
your coſtly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Jewels, gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of gold and ſilver, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
dreſſings of vanity, by which
you deſire to draw the eies of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
upon you, are unworthy of
a Chriſtian wife, and, indeed, in
ſtead of ſetting her forth, renders
her deformed.</p>
                  <p>Fathers and Mothers, breed
your Children in the fear of our
Lord: Suffer them not in your
preſence to offend him, unto
whom they appertain more then
to your ſelves, and for whoſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
you ought to bring them
up. Be carefull rather to make
them good then rich, and breed
them rather for heaven then the
earth. Never provoke them to
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:170075:115"/>
anger, nor make them deſpair by
holding too vigorous a hand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
them, but rather uſe indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
towards them to reduce
them to reaſon if they fly out.</p>
                  <p>Children, obey your Fathers
and Mothers: the obſervance of
this command, for your encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement,
is recompenced with
the promiſe of a long life. The
honour which you give them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
to God who is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of all Paternity both in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and earth. Bear with their
froward humors, ſhun all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of diſpleaſing them, and
aſſuredly believe, you can never
acquit your ſelves of the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
you owe in duty to them.</p>
                  <p>You that are ſervants, reſpect
your Maſters with a ſincere and
upright heart, and believe, that
in ſerving them as you ought,
you ſerve Jeſus Chriſt. Do not
render them ſervice only when
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:170075:115"/>
they look upon you for hope of
reward or fear of puniſhment: but
do it in conformity to the faith
and religion you profeſs. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
your ſelves as Servants of
our Lord, for the love of whom
you ſerve men, whoſe providence
you ought to adore, that has put
you in that condition. Think
not of freeing your ſelves of that
bondage, but to uſe it well and
to make it voluntary. Expect
from him the rewards due to
your ſervice, your fidelity and
diligence with love and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and without murmuring
or replies; glorifie the doctrine
of Jeſus Chriſt, and let Infidels
ſee, it belongs onely to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
to produce ſuch ſervants.</p>
                  <p>Maſters, do not abuſe the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of your ſlaves, nor continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
torment them: let not their
ears be alwaies filled with threats
and reproachfull language, and
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:170075:116"/>
much leſs uſe the ſtaffe or whip:
Know you have all one Maſter
who is in heaven, who from
thence ſees in what manner you
treat them, and who makes no
diſtinction of perſons in his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice;
give unto them thoſe things
which are neceſſary, have a due
regard of them in their health
and ſickneſs, and remember that
he who neglects them is worſe
then an Infidel, for even then he
renounces his faith: In baptiſm
they are made your brothers;
they are called to the ſame inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance,
and that little diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
betwixt you and them in the
world will quickly vaniſh.</p>
                  <p>Virgins, be carefull that you
be as chaſt in your mindes as in
your bodies. Study onely to
pleaſe our Lord who is your
Spouſe, and who ought to be all
things to you. Shun all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that may withdraw you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:170075:116"/>
ſo little from him. Nouriſh
your ſelves with praier, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
your bodies as an enemy of
whom you muſt be alwaies in
diſtruſt.</p>
                  <p>Widdows, if you have chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
let your care be employed
in governing yonr families. You
are deprived of a great ſupport,
in the loſs of your husbands; but
God is called the husband of
Widdows, and if you put your
truſt in him, you will not be
forſaken: prayer ought to be
your daily and nightly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment,
and let the modeſty of
your attire be ſuch, as by it one
may judge of the inclinations of
your heart, and the purity of
your Widdowhood. All that
ſavours either of curioſity, affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation,
or vanity, is very ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming
your condition. You
ought to be retired, and to love
ſolitude. In fine, if you plunge
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:170075:117"/>
your ſelves in delights, what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour
profeſſion ſoever you
make of piety &amp; devotion, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to lead the life of the new
man, yet 'tis certain you are dead
in the eies of God.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Whileſt the Apoſtle thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed,
the night advanced, nor
were his auditors at all weary to
heare ſo admirable inſtructions. A
young man called <hi>Euthicus</hi> heard
him from a window a great while,
but at laſt ſurpriſed with ſleep, hee
fell down dead from the third ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
This fearfull accident interru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
the Apoſtle, but it was an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to conclude his Sermon
with a miracle: For he went down
from the room, and layed himſelfe
upon the dead body, and by that
ſovereigne imbrace reſtored him to
life. Then preſently he went up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and after he had eaten &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
the holy bread, he ſpake to
the faithfull untill the break of
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:170075:117"/>
day, and then took his leave. His
Companions went to a town called
<hi>Aſſon,</hi> near to <hi>Troad,</hi> and thither he
came to them by land as he had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed.
There they re-imbarqued
together, and the firſt town they put
into was <hi>Mytilen.</hi> The next day
they caſt anchor before the Iſland
of <hi>Chyo,</hi> the third day before <hi>Samos,</hi>
&amp; the fourth in the harbor of <hi>Mille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi>
He would not go to <hi>Epheſus,</hi>
fearing he might there be ſtayed,
and ſo hindred from keeping the
feaſt of Pentecoſt at <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> as
he had deſigned: notwithſtanding
he could not paſs ſo near this great
City, where he had gained ſuch
glorious Conqueſts, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
himſelf of the condition
of that Church ſince his departure.
For which cauſe hee ſent unto the
Prieſts who governed there, to come
and ſpeak with him. St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi>
ſayes, that hee convocated the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
and Prieſts of the next adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:170075:118"/>
places. The text of St. <hi>Luke</hi>
ſpeaks nothing of it, but if we will
conſider the forme of Eccleſiaſticall
Government in that time, there is
no doubt but by that word Elders
or Prieſts, the Biſhop of <hi>Epheſus</hi> who
was the chief of them was compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.
This news was very welcome
to them, and after he had imbraced
them all, he ſpake in this manner.</p>
               <p>Deare Brethren, being ſo neare, I
could not paſs by without giving my
ſelf the comfort of ſeeing you, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
to aſſure you, the holy affection I bear
you is alwayes reſiding firme in my
heart. You may remember in what
manner I lived ſince the firſt day I
came into <hi>Aſia.</hi> I had nothing in my
thoughts but the ſervice of my Maſter,
and the health of your Souls. I have
humbly delivered a Goſpel of humility.
The perſecutions which the Jews raiſed
againſt me, I have oppoſed onely with
my praiers and tears, nor did they at
all abate my courage. At all hours, on
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:170075:118"/>
all occaſions, in all places, both in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
and private, I have preached to
them as well as to the Gentiles, the faith
of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of pennance. In ſumme, my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
does not accuſe me to have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
any thing that might tend to
your ſalvation. At this time leaving
my ſelf to the conduct of the holy Ghoſt,
I am going to <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what in particular might befall me,
although in generall the Spirit of God
aſſures me by prophetick revelations,
thorow all the Cities where I am to paſs,
that I ſhall ſuffer many afflictions. But
I fear neither chains, nor priſons, nor
other puniſhments which attend mee.
For I think I can endure all by the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of him that ſtrengthens me; and
I do not regard the preſervation of my
life, in compariſon with the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of my duty. My ſole ayme is
faithfully to end my cariere, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the charge which I have received
of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to declare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:170075:119"/>
men the happy tidings of his grace.
I know you will ſee me no more, and this
being the laſt time I ſhall ſpeak to you,
makes me beg with the more inſtance,
that you will imprint in your memories
thoſe things which I am now about to
impart unto you. God has raiſed you
to the dignity of Biſhops and Prieſts,
and do not think he has done it for the
love of you; It is for the good of his
Church, which you are to governe with
diligence full of fidelity. I will not lay
before you many conſiderations, to let
you ſee the importance of this your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and the horror of your puniſhments
which will follow your negligence. It is
enough that I tell you, this Church
whereof the holy Ghoſt has made you
Paſtors, to the end you govern it,
is the Spouſe of Jeſus Chriſt, and he
has ſhed his bloud for her. You muſt
know, it is not enough to ſpeak to the
fa<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>thfull, you muſt cry out, you muſt urge
them, you muſt conjure them, you muſt
reprove them, and be not affraid to be
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:170075:119"/>
thought impor<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>une. There are ſoules
which are preſently gained, and others
that are not purchaſed but by violence,
and muſt be healed by ſharp remedies;
have great attention therefore &amp; zeal
in your conduct, that you may gain e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one to God. Regard neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
wit, riches, nor the like, which
may make you deſiſt or condeſcend to
any thing that is baſe or unworthy. But
be you irreprehenſible Labourers, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Stewards, ſincere Embaſſadors of
our Lord; for it is by you that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
his will to men, and it is at your
hands hee will demand their ſoules.
Think of feeding your Flock, and not
how to cloath your ſelves with their
wooll and drink of their milk. There is
nothing more ſhamefull to a Biſhop or
Prieſt then covetouſneſs, and the deſire
of ſordid gain: that juſtly takes away
all credit from them, and much wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
the force of their preaching. We
brought nothing with us into the world,

money is the root of all evils. Yet for
this we muſt not condemn rich men, but
put them often in minde, that they be

in the living God, whoſe enjoyment can
only render us truly happy. You muſt
alſo avoid another extremity, which is
the neglect of your own families; for
how ſhall he that cannot govern his
own houſe, govern well the Church.
Your family muſt be like a Church, by
the exemplar life of all thoſe that are
in it; and your children born before
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:170075:120"/>
your ordination, muſt preach in ſilence
to all the faithfull under your charge, by
their modeſty, and by the ſanctity of
their lives. After you have been heard
ſpeak, men will caſt their eies upon the
manner of your life, and if your actions
do not correſpond with your words, your
preaching will be unprofitable. Be you
your ſelves ſober, to perſuade ſobriety;
chaſt, to teach others continency; pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
when you ſuffer injuries, to learn
others how to bear them; and modeſt,
to invite others to modeſty. Let your
humility confound the proud, and the
contempt you have of riches, reprove the
covetous, and make them aſhamed:
uſe hoſpitality, to the end you may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
your Brethren that are able to
practiſe it. Love the poore, and be ye
firſt in their aſſiſtance, that by your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
others may reſpect &amp; help them.
Keep a watchfull guard upon your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
that your hands which are conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
to bleſs the people, never ſtrike
any body. Above all, avoid temporall
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:170075:121"/>
affairs, for you are Souldiers of a mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia
that requires you intirely, and you
ſerve a Maſter whom only you muſt ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to pleaſe. The ſanctification and
conduct of ſouls which he has redeemed;
the eſtabliſhment of his kingdome by
preaching his word are ſo glorious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
that you ought to contemne
all others though preſented to you by the
greateſt Prince of the earth. When ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the glory of our Lord, or charity
requires you to undertake any affair,
be not negligent, but preſently quit
your own repoſe and quiet. Without
ſuch like occaſions, attend to cultivate
the field which is appointed for you.
For Chriſtians are the fields of God,
planted and watered by him, and to
him it belongs to give the encreaſe. It
ſuffices for your part, that you omit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to make the Goſpel flouriſh. Be
watchfull, for after my departure ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venous
wolves will fall upon your flocke,
and devoure them without pity; and
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:170075:121"/>
many falſe doctours ſhall riſe amongſt
you, who will ſeduce a great number
of the faithfull by their falſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.
They will come with the
name of our Lord in their mouthes;
their lookes will be modeſt, their words
Saint-like, their actions wary, their
lives ſevere, and they will teach nothing
that is not delightfull. But indeed they
will be wolves in the skinnes of ſheep.
They will be men that are lovers of
themſelves, fraught with inordinate
deſires, puffed up with pride, obſtinate
in what they hold, jealous of their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
and unſatiable in praiſe, honor
and reſpect. They will be called Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
give rules to all, and concerning
all things, have the firſt place, and be
conſidered as men that had nothing of
earth in them. Theſe blinde guides
will lead many others, &amp; ſo all fall into
the ditch: you ſhall ſee them come into
houſes, and inquire into the greateſt
ſecrets of families, not to reform the
diſorders, but to ſoment them, ſo to
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:170075:122"/>
make benefit of their indulgence. They
will abuſe men by their falſe Maxims;
they will make uſe of the ſimplicity of
women, whom they will lead by flocks,
aud make them believe they will free
them from the burthen of their ſinnes;
they will entertain them with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
vain &amp; ſuperfluous things, which
ſhall render them alwaies more curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
but never more learned in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of piety, which they ought chiefly
to know. In fine, they will oppoſe truth,
which is never favourable to them, and
will riſe up againſt you, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to the power which Jeſus Chriſt
has given you, as <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres</hi>
did againſt <hi>Moyſes.</hi> You are not
the work of men, but the work of Jeſus
Chriſt that Sovereign Prieſt, who has
made you Prieſts, to the end you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
the functions of his royall Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.
He, who is the head of Men and
Angels, will have you receive from him
the influences of his graces, to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
them to his members; you are the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:170075:122"/>
head of his myſtical body, which cannot
ſubſiſt without you; you are the eye to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten
it, the tongue to inſtruct it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
the boſome to harbor it, untill our Lord

in a work that is ſo admirable, be

you have not much advanced, reſolve to

Whileſt a woman feels the pains of her
childe-bearing, ſhe cries out aloud, but
no ſooner is ſhe delivered, when ſhe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
all her dolours, &amp; rejoices becauſe
ſhe has brought a man into the world:
What then will be your joy, when you
ſhall have given children to God? and
how can all thoſe agonies, thoſe diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets,
thoſe perſecutions, which you are to
ſuffer before, ſeem troubleſom to you? For
my ſelf, I do neither glory that I am an
Iſraelite, or that I am skilful in the law,
nor that I have been elevated up to
heaven, nor that I am an Apoſtle, nor in
any other quality of my perſon. But all
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:170075:123"/>
my glory is, that I have ſuffered incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
perſecutions for Jeſus Chriſt. The
moſt glorious badges of my Apoſtleſhip
is, to ſee me in nakedneſs, to ſee me in
want of food, of drink, in miſery, in
priſons, in chaines, in affronts and
ſcorns for the ſalvation of thoſe to whom
God has deſtinated the light of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.
It is now time that I leave you:
yet awake a while, and call to minde
the verities which I have declared unto
you, during the ſpace of three years. I
leave you to the protection of God, who
by his goodneſs having promiſed a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
kingdom to his ſervants, is both
faithfull and powerfull to fulfill his
word. For my own part, I do not think
any one can reproach me; I have not
taken gold nor ſilver of any one; I have
furniſhed my ſelf and thoſe that were
with me with things neceſſary for our
ſubſiſtance by the labour of my hands.
I have lived after this manner, to give
you example how Charity ought to be
dis-intereſſed, with the which you are
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:170075:123"/>
to provide for the neceſſities of the poor,
and alſo to put you in remembrance of
that excellent Maxim of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, <hi>It is a more noble thing
to give then to receive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apoſtle ended this his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
and, kneeling down, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with thoſe who were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.
That expreſſion of his, when
he ſaid, It was the laſt time they
ſhould ſee him, cauſed a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment
in them; they all imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
him with ſignes of great love,
and, with teares in their eies, bid
him farewell.</p>
               <p>They ſtayed all upon the ſhore,
untill they loſt ſight of the veſſell
which took its courſe ſtraight to
the Iſle of <hi>Coo,</hi> famous by the birth
of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> the Prince of Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
as alſo of <hi>Apelles,</hi> ſo highly ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated
amongſt Painters. The
next day they rode before the Iſle
of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> renowned for her Coloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
of an hundred and five foot
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:170075:124"/>
high, with an hundred of a leſſer
ſort about it. From thence they
came to <hi>Patara,</hi> the Metropolis of
<hi>Lycia,</hi> where finding a veſſel bound
for <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> they put themſelves
into it. He paſſed in ſight of the
Iſle of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> which he left on the
right hand, and landed at <hi>Tyre,</hi>
where he ſtayed ſeven dayes. The
faithfull there received him with
extraordinary reſpect, &amp; with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
of much tender affection.
The holy Ghoſt had revealed to
them, that he was to ſuffer much
perſecution at <hi>Hieruſalem;</hi> and
therefore they uſed their utmoſt
endeavours to hinder him from
going thither. But the ſame reaſon
invited him to make that voyage.
He parted thence againſt their
wills, and was brought to the
ſhore by men, women, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
After they had prayed on
their knees together, he imbarked
in another veſſel, and advancing
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:170075:124"/>
with full ſails, landed in the Port
of <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> where he ſtayed but
one day. The next day he came
near to <hi>Ceſ<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rea</hi> the new, called the
Tower of <hi>Straton,</hi> where the old
<hi>Herod</hi> had made ſumptuous works
to gain the favour of <hi>Auguſtus Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi>
from whom hee gave it the
name. <hi>Philip,</hi> one of the firſt ſeven
Deacons, lodged him, and his ſtay
there was a very great conſolation
to the faithfull of that Church. His
hoſt had four daughters, who being
endued with the gift of Propheſie,
declared unto him the evils which
were prepared for him. But <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi>
of whom we have already ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
following the cuſtome of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Prophets, joyned the ſign to his
words: For, taking the girdle of
the Apoſtle, and tying his own feet
and hands with it, ſayed to thoſe
that were preſent, Hear the Oracle
of the holy Ghoſt: <hi>The man to whom
this girdle belongs, ſhall be tyed as I
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:170075:125"/>
am, by the Jews, who ſhall deliver him
up to the Gentiles.</hi> This diſcourſe
much afflicted all thoſe who heard
it, and cauſed every one with teares
in their eies to conjure S. <hi>Paul</hi> not
to go to <hi>Hieruſalem.</hi> But his great
courage could not be mollified,
neither by the certainty of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
nor by their intreaties, nor the
tears of his Diſciples. He ſayed to
them, <hi>Why will you, by afflicting your
ſelves, give me affliction, &amp; hinder me
from giving teſtimony to my Maſter,
how much I love him? I am not onely
ready to be bound and impriſoned at</hi>
Hieruſalem, <hi>but if I be to looſe my

&amp; very important for the glory of

to unite by little and little theſe
two people, and to make them one.
S.</hi> James <hi>and the Prieſts told him:</hi>
You ſee, dear Brother, the great number
of <hi>Jewes,</hi> who make profeſſion of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in Chriſt, but notwithſtanding
their faith, they are very zealous ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers
of their antient Law for the
honor of which they continue a moſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
zeal. Now ſome have made them
believe, that you are a declared enemy
of it, and teach, That thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> who
are ſpread amongſt the Gentiles, ought
not to circumciſe their children, nor
practiſe any legal obſervance. In fine,
they are perſwaded you endeavour to
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:170075:126"/>
make them revolt openly againſt their
Law. This report has ſcandalized and
animated them againſt you, ſo as we
fear ſome troubleſom tumult, when they
ſhall underſtand you are here, and ſhall
ſee you in the Aſſembly which cannot
be hindred from being ſummoned upon
your arrival. But if you will follow our
advice, you may appeaſe theſe ſpirits,
and purge your ſelf of the calumny caſt
upon you. We have here amongſt us
four men, who are to perform a vow
they have made to offer their haire to
God in the Temple, according to the
Ceremony ordained to <hi>Nazaraeans.</hi> Do
you joyn your ſelf with them in this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
contribute alſo to the charge of
the neceſſary Sacrifices, and ohſerve all
that is practiſed in this occaſion, that it
may be known, thoſe reports, which go of
you, are falſe, and that you obſerve the
Law. Nor can this give to the Gentiles
any ſubject of murmuration or fear that
the ſame yoke ſhall be impoſed on them;
for we have determined long ſince, as
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:170075:127"/>
you know, that it ſuffices for them to
abſtain from meats offered to Idols,
from bloud, from ſtrangled fleſh, and
from fornication.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle was too charitable
not to condeſcend to the infirmity
of his Brethren, and would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
to be a <hi>Jew</hi> with <hi>Jewes,</hi> he that
made himſelf all things to all men,
that he might gaine all to Jeſus
Chriſt. The next day therefore he
began the Ceremony of Purificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as had been counſelled him, the
which laſted ſeven dayes, as we have
before obſerved. But as he was in
the Temple, offering the Sacrifice
ordained by the Law for <hi>Nazarites,</hi>
who had made their vow but for a
time, or whoſe vow was intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by ſome legal pollution; he by
chance was known by ſome <hi>Jewes</hi>
of <hi>Aſia,</hi> who began to cry out, that
this was the mortal enemy of the
law of <hi>Moyſes,</hi> and not content to
ſpread his doctrine in remote Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:170075:127"/>
was ſo impudent and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
as to introduce Gentiles into
that holy place. They meant <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phimus;</hi>
for having ſeen him in his
company in the city, they believed,
or would have others to believe,
that he had brought him into the
Temple with him. At the name of
<hi>Paul,</hi> all the town was in commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
the people got together from
all parts, dragged him out of the
Temple, and he had certainly been
killed, if <hi>Lyſias</hi> (who commanded a
band of Souldiers appointed for
the guard of the Temple on feſtival
daies to prevent ſeditions) had not
been informed of the Tumult that
was beginning, and come in haſte
with his Captaines and Souldiers
to appeaſe them. The ſight of him
ſtopped a little the fury of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
who then ceaſed to ſtrike and
abuſe the Apoſtle. <hi>Lyſias</hi> made him
preſently be bound with two
chaines, and asked him what he had
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:170075:128"/>
done, and what he was. But the
noiſe and cries of the multitude
were ſo great, as neither the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
nor the anſwer could be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.
Wherefore <hi>Lyſias</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
to conduct him to <hi>Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
Tower, that hee might ſecure
him, which hee had no ſmall trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to do; for the people who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
would have faln upon him,
crying out upon every one to kill
him.</p>
               <p>Not long before, there was an
<hi>Egyptian</hi> in <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> who coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited
himſelf to be a <hi>Prophet,</hi> and
that by a word onely, he could
make the walls of the City to fall
down; this man had got a great
multitude of followers, &amp; amongſt
them divers murderers. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
<hi>Felix</hi> having notice of it,
ſent preſently a party of Souldiers,
who falling upon theſe poore abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
people, killed or took the
greateſt part of them. The <hi>Egyptian</hi>
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:170075:128"/>
ſaved himſelfe, but ſome of thoſe
murthering villaines continued to
ſtirre up the people, and to burn the
villages where they found any reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lyſias</hi> asked S. <hi>Paul</hi> if he was not
the Commander of thoſe rebels. He
anſwered him, that hee was a <hi>Jew,</hi>
and native of <hi>Tharſus</hi> in <hi>Cilicia,</hi> a
Municipal town well known. After
the Apoſtle had made him this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
he deſired leave that he might
ſpeak to the people; which being
granted, he began his diſcourſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
how hee had perſecuted the
Church, &amp; his miraculous conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
of which wee ſpake in the firſt
book of this Hiſtory: he added
moreover, that when hee came to
<hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> which I believe was the
firſt voyage he made thither, Jeſus
Chriſt appeared to him, as he was
praying in the Temple, and ſaid to
him, <hi>Depart quickly out of</hi> Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,
<hi>for they will not receive the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:170075:129"/>
which thou giveſt of me:</hi> and he
anſwering that they ought not to
ſuſpect his teſtimony, having ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himſelf ſo zealous in defence of
the Law, and was not only preſent
at the death of <hi>Stephen,</hi> but conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to it, &amp; kept the garments of
thoſe that ſtoned him. Our Lord
replied again, <hi>Go, do that which I
command, for I will ſend thee unto
Nations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At this word of <hi>Nations,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi>
loſt all patience, &amp; breaking ſilence
which they had willingly kept,
hearing him to ſpeak in their
tongue, they cryed out in a fearfull
tone, <hi>He is a wicked man, and ought
not to live longer upon the face of the
earth,</hi> let him be put to death: they
added to thoſe clamours, actions
which ſufficiently manifeſted their
fury, for they ſhook their garments,
and gathering up duſt, threw it into
the aire, to make it known they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
him that had ſpoken to them.
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:170075:129"/>
This great commotion made <hi>Lyſias</hi>
command that he ſhould be led in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Tower of <hi>Antoninus;</hi> for S.
<hi>Paul</hi> had ſpoken to the people from
the top of the ſtaires which lead up
to it. <hi>Lyſias</hi> his deſigne was to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort
by ſtripes from him the reaſon
of this great uprore. The Apoſtle
would willingly have ſuffered this
great ignominy for the love of his
Maſter, but a ſecret inſpiration of
the holy Ghoſt moved him to tell a
Captain who was at hand, and had
charge to ſee the orders of <hi>Lyſias</hi>
put in execution; <hi>That they ſhould
take heed what they did; for, beſides
his innocency which ought to exempt
him from being whipped, he was a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen
of</hi> Rome. This was preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
told to <hi>Lyſias,</hi> who would be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
of it from his owne mouth,
ſaying, That the Priviledge of a
Citizen, which he boaſts of, had
coſt him a great ſumme of money.
The Apoſtle anſwered, it had coſt
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:170075:130"/>
him nothing, for my birth (ſaies he)
obtained me this honour. Indeed,
amongſt many other Priviledges,
which <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> &amp; <hi>Auguſtus</hi> had
beſtowed on <hi>Tharſis</hi> in recompence
of the ſervices done by the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of that place, in the warres of
<hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Brutus,</hi> one was to be
Citizens of <hi>Rome.</hi> Now by a Law
of <hi>Valerius Publicola,</hi> confirmed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
by a Law of <hi>Sempronius,</hi> and by
the Law <hi>Porcien,</hi> Magiſtrates were
forbidden to whip a Citizen of
<hi>Rome.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Lyſias</hi> cauſed the
chaines to be taken off the Apoſtle,
and that he might ſound the depth
of this buſineſs, commanded the
Prieſts of the <hi>Jewes</hi> to aſſemble
themſelves the next day in ſome
place near the fortreſs, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
they did. Thither they
led this Criminal which made a
great uprore, and when ſilence was
made, he began his diſcourſe, with a
Proteſtation, that he had lived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:170075:130"/>
till that time without any reproach
both before God and man. But he
was preſently interrupted by the
Prince of the Prieſts there aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
who was called <hi>Ananias.</hi> This
man very unworthy of the rank he
held, being tranſported with fury
againſt the cauſe, as well as againſt
the advocate, or it may be, offended
in that the Apoſtle had not given
him thoſe titles of honour which
he expected, ſaluting them all by
the name of Brothers, commanded
thoſe who were next the Apoſtle to
buffet him. S. <hi>Paul</hi> having as yet ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
no propoſition of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
in revenge of which, to have
received this injury would have
been delightfull; and judging that
in this occaſion he ought to defend
the honor of his Maſters miniſtery,
told <hi>Ananias</hi> in a prophetick ſpirit,
and in the tone of a Maſter; <hi>God
will ſtrike thee, whited wall. Thou ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
here to judge me according to the
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:170075:131"/>
Law, and contrary to the Law; thou
makeſt me to be abuſed, before I have
ſaid any thing to deſerve this uſage.</hi>
Whereupon, one of the aſſiſtants
ſayed, What doeſt thou mean to
threaten and injure the high Prieſt
of God in this manner? The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
(whom paſſion had not tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and who perhaps had heard
the voice of <hi>Annanias,</hi> and not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
his perſon, in regard of the
diſorder in the Aſſembly, whence
perhaps he ſat not in the accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
place which was uſed in meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
or for ſome other reaſon,
which imports not much to know)
replied quietly: <hi>Brethren, if I had
knowne hee had been Prince of the
Prieſts, I had born him more reſpect,
knowing that it is written, Thou ſhalt
uſe no malediction or injurious word to
the Prince of the people.</hi> This anſwer
did not appeaſe thoſe ſpirits, ſo
that he was fain to have recourſe to
a pious and prudent artifice to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:170075:131"/>
out of their hands. He knew, in
that Aſſembly there was a mixture
of Phariſees &amp; Sadduces who were
much averſe one to the other, by
reaſon of their difference in opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and manner of living: Now to
break that union, wherein he ſaw
them combined to ruine, and to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the Goſpel, he ſpake in a loud
voice: <hi>That he ſaw in his cauſe, they
would change a particular intereſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
an affaire of Religion; that he was
of the ſect of the Phariſees, and ſon of a
Phariſee, and that in hatred, becauſe
he believed and taught the reſurrection
of the dead,</hi> (which the Sadduces
denyed as well as the immorality
of the ſoul) <hi>they brought him there
unto Judgement.</hi> Preſently the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
followed, as he foreſaw: The
Phariſees and Sadduces began to
riſe up one againſt another; the
Phariſees in oppoſition to the Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces,
rather then out of love to
the Apoſtle, ſaid, <hi>We find not this man
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:170075:132"/>
guilty of any crime. How do we know
that the Spirit of God or ſome Angel
hath not ſpoke unto him? Being thus
uncertain, let not us oppoſe him.</hi> So
the Aſſembly brake up, but with ſo
much heat of conteſtation, that <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias</hi>
fearing leſt the Apoſtle might be
torn in pieces, conducted him into
the Cittadell. The night follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
our Lord appeared unto him,
and ſaid, <hi>Be thou conſtant, as thou haſt
born teſtimony of me in</hi> Hieruſalem,
<hi>thou ſhalt alſo do the ſame in</hi> Rome.
This viſion repleniſhed his joy, and
wonderfully fortified his courage
againſt the obſtacles which hee
found afterwards in his preaching.</p>
               <p>Certain <hi>Jewes,</hi> whom zeal had
made more furious then the reſt,
laid an ambuſh for him the next
day, whereinto he muſt needs have
fallen, if divine Providence had not
diſcovered it. A nephew of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
coming to the knowledge of
it, went to advertiſe him, that for
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:170075:132"/>
certain there were forty men who
had vowed neither to eat not drink
till they had killed him; and to
execute their deſigne, it was agreed
that the Prieſts and Antients of the
the Synagogue ſhould demand a
ſecond Aſſembly, to examine bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his crime, or his innocency, and
upon the way as he ſhould come to
it, they would kill him. S. <hi>Paul</hi>
was not negligent in ſending his
Nephew unto <hi>Ly<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>as,</hi> to give him
notice of this, who found it ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
as he gave full credit to it,
and immediately ordered, that two
Captains ſhould take two hundred
foot, and as many Lanceers,
with ſeventy horſe, which were to
be in readineſs to depart the third
hour of the night, to conduct the
Apoſtle unto <hi>Ceſarea,</hi> and to deliver
him there into the hands of <hi>Felix</hi>
the Proconſul, doubting that he
ſhould not be able to defend him
from the violence of his enemies,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:170075:133"/>
&amp; might afterwards be accuſed to
have delivered him up to their fury
for a ſumme of money. This <hi>Felix</hi>
was brother to <hi>Pallas,</hi> favorite of the
Emperour <hi>Claudius,</hi> and by his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation
had obtained the
Government of <hi>Iudea,</hi> of which his
birth, but more the infamy of his
manners, rendred him moſt unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy.
He had debauched <hi>Druſilla,</hi> ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
to the young <hi>Agrippa,</hi> who for
love of him left her religion, and
<hi>Aziſis</hi> her firſt husband, King of the
<hi>Emeſ<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eus. Tacitus</hi> ſpeaking of him,
ſayes, that to the baſeneſs of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile
minde, all the inſolencies and
cruelties of a Tyrant were joyned.
After the death of Jeſus Chriſt, God
began to make the Jewes to feel the
juſt puniſhment of their abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
parricide, by the evil uſage of
thoſe Governours whom the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
ſent unto them. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi>
heretofore the School of
Piety, was now become the recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:170075:133"/>
of Magicians, Murtherers, and
Impoſtors. In the Temple, upon ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Feaſts, horrible murthers were
committed, and they were ſure to
eſcape puniſhment if they could
content the avarice of <hi>Felix,</hi> in this
point a worthy ſucceſſour of <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,</hi>
under whoſe government the
<hi>Iewes</hi> had ſuffered all ſorts of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages.</p>
               <p>The Souldiers, who had charge
of the Apoſtle, arrived ſafe at <hi>Ceſ<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea,</hi>
and gave unto <hi>Felix</hi> a letter
from <hi>Lyſias,</hi> in which he wrote:
<hi>That finding the man whom he ſent
ready to be ſlain by the</hi> Jews, <hi>in a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
ſtirred up againſt him, he forced
him out of their hands, and the rather,
becauſe he underſtood be was a Citizen
of</hi> Rome; <hi>and ſearching into the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of his accuſation, found it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
ſome queſtions of the Law, and for
the reſt hee was not guilty of any
crime deſerving either death or impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment:
beſides he had notice that
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:170075:134"/>
ambuſhes were laid to kill him; hence
he was neceſſitated to ſend him thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
advertiſing his accuſers to repair
unto him, there to produce their depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions.
Felix</hi> having conſidered
this letter, cauſed S. <hi>Paul</hi> to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the Pretorium, that is to
ſay, the Palace built by old <hi>Herod,</hi>
there to be kept till his accuſers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
at the time aſſigned them.
The fifth day, <hi>Annanias,</hi> and divers
old men that were of the Council,
called by the <hi>Iewes Sanhedrin,</hi> who
underſtood the affaires of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
arrived at <hi>Ceſarea.</hi> They
brought with them an Orator cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Tertullus</hi> to plead their cauſe,
and when <hi>Felix</hi> gave them audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
he ſpake in this manner.</p>
               <p>Since the divine Providence, and
the goodneſs of Emperours, moſt prudent
and excellent <hi>Felix,</hi> have conſtituted
you Governour of <hi>Judea,</hi> we have ſeen
Juſtice flouriſh again Diſcord, which
had made deſolate this poor Province,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:170075:134"/>
has been b<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>niſhed, and the diſturbers
of publick quiet have met with puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
due to their crimes, whileſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
people are ſeen to live in ſecurity.
You are not content to apply remedies
unto things preſent, and paſt, but your
prudence extends even to things to
come, and diſſipates tempeſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they ariſe. This conduct of yours
gives us a great reſpect to your perſon,
and, if we ſhould not adde to it an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
love for the continuall acts of
grace we receive, we were the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful
of men. We are in hope you
doubt not of it, and we eaſily perſwade
that in our affairs, but principally our
ſelves in publick affairs, we may aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly
have recourſe to your protection.
There will never be preſented an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of more importance then this which
has brought us hither before you, ſince
the intereſt of State and of Religion
are both in agitation at this time. We
will not longer abuſe the honour you do
us in hearing this cauſe, and in one
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:170075:135"/>
word we will tell you the ſubject of our
complaints, which we doubt not but you
will judge to be reaſonable. This lewd
man you behold here before you, teaches
the world that peſtilent doctrine of the
<hi>Nazarean</hi> Sect, in which the revolt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
a lawfull Prince is joyned with
impietie againſt God. After he had
ſpread his poiſon over all the earth, he
came to <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> (if he could) to
corrupt Religion at the Spring head;
he has been ſo wicked as to violate the
ſanctity of the Temple, by introducing
perſons, who by our Law are excluded
the place: We took him in theſe crimes,
and we ſeized upon him, and if <hi>Lyſias</hi>
the Tribune had not forced him by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
out of our hands, we had judged
him according to our cuſtomes. But we
truſt in your juſtice, that you will not
violate our Priviledges, to let an impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor
and ſeditious perſon be protected
by you. I do not deſire you ſhould give
credit to my diſcourſe; theſe men ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable
by their age and quality, who
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:170075:135"/>
have choſen me their ſpeaker, will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
by oath all theſe things which I
have delivered.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Tertullus</hi> ended his ſpeech, and
the <hi>Jewes</hi> ſwore all that he ſaid was
true. The Proconſul making ſigne
to the Apoſtle to defend himſelf, he
ſpake after this manner.</p>
               <p>I am very glad I am to defend my
innocency before a Judge, who by the
long abode he has made in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
may have come to the perfect
knowledge of the humors and intereſts
of men. It is eaſie for you to know that
it is not above twelve dayes ſince I
came to <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> there to adore
God in the Temple, and there is none
can teſtifie that he heard me diſpute
of Religion, either in the Temple, Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue,
or in any particular houſe, or
that I have been ſeen to do any thing
that might ſtirre up the people to ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Certainly, if it be enough to gain
belief impudently to accuſe, there is no
innocency can be ſecure. They endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:170075:136"/>
to make me be thought a blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
of the Law of <hi>Moyſes,</hi> but I am
far from being guilty of that crime.
'Tis true, I make profeſſion of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Jeſus Chriſt; I do not deny to
be of that Sect, which our Adverſaries
call Hereſe, with as great ignorance as
impiety; I adore the ſame God which
our Fore-Fathers adored; I believe all
the holy Scriptures, all the Oracles of
the Prophets, and all the ordinances of
<hi>Moyſes.</hi> I believe, as they do, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
of the dead, the reward of
good works after this life, and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
of evil. For, beſides that I am
a <hi>Jew</hi> by Nation and Religion, I have
from my youth been of the Sect of the
Phariſees, the which amongſt us are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
more ſtrict in the obſervation of
the Law. In a word, I have hitherto
endeavoured ſo to live, as neither to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
God nor men. Some years being
paſt, ſince my Converſion to the Faith of
Jeſus Chriſt, I came now to <hi>Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
to render my vowes in the Temple,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:170075:136"/>
and to bring to the poor Citizens thoſe
Alms which I had gathered out of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Provinces. In that holy place,
where I thought of nothing but to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
my ſelfe according to the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of <hi>Moyſes,</hi> I was ſeized upon as
a lewd perſon, and without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
inquiry, cryed out by a common
voice, <hi>That ſome one ſhould kill me
as an enemy of Religion.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi>
of <hi>Aſia,</hi> who raiſed that ſedition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
me, in which I ran the hazzard
of my life, ought to be preſent, becauſe
they are my firſt accuſers. Let thoſe
who are here ſay, if they could accuſe
me of any crime when I appeared in
their Council to anſwer that which
was objected againſt me. And if this
diſcourſe be ſeditious, I refer it to the
judgement of any that is not blinded
with paſſion. In fine, ſince the accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
I am charged with, are onely ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,
and have no other proof then the
teſtimony of adverſaries, I think it is
a ſufficient anſwer that I deny them,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:170075:137"/>
and the hatred of mine enemies is ſo
known, that it may juſtifie my inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.</p>
               <p>This plain diſcourſe, without art,
made <hi>Felix</hi> ſee the truth, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
he would neither condemn nor
acquit him; on the one ſide, he was
affraid to diſcontent the <hi>Jews,</hi> &amp; on
the other, having obſerv'd in S. <hi>Pauls</hi>
diſcourſe, that he ſpake of great
Alms which he had brought with
him, he imagined ſome part of the
money might fall into his hands;
wherefore he deferred the deciſion
of the cauſe to the arrival of <hi>Lyſ<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>as,</hi>
and till he had a more ample in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.
In the mean time he
committed the Apoſtle unto the
cuſtody of a Captain, with free li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to all of his acquaintance
both to viſit and aſſiſt him.</p>
               <p>Some dayes after, by the perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of <hi>Druſilla, Felix</hi>'s wife, who
was a <hi>Jew,</hi> he would hear the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
ſpeak of the Evangelical do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doctrine;
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:170075:137"/>
and wee may ſuppoſe it
was after this manner.</p>
               <p>I cannot refuſe, moſt prudent <hi>Felix,</hi>
to ſatisfie the deſire you have to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the doctrine which I preach, and
I heartily wiſh your deſ<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re proceeded
not from curioſity, but from a ture ſenſe
and care of your ſalvation.</p>
               <p>You muſt not expect from me fine
language, as from an excellent Orator,
I confeſs I know not how to ſpeak with
the ornaments and acuteneſs of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
wiſedom, and were I capable, I
ſhould hold it unworthy to be imployed
in declaring to you a God crucified. I
know, at firſt this word will ſeem
ſtrange to you, and you will believe that
I go about to perſwade you to a folly, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then to a paradox. But beare me,
if you pleaſe, with patience, and you
ſhall ſee (if God ſo pleaſe) that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
unto you the height of wiſedome.
God being a pure Spirit, compleat in
himſelf, living by his own proper life,
immortal, happy, wiſe, omnipotent, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:170075:138"/>
cannot be ſeen as hee is by the
feeble eies of men, nor comprehended
by their underſtandings. But to lead
them to the knowledge of his inviſible
perfections, he would produce creatures
in whom his Divinity might be ſeen.
He has even engraved in the depth of
mans heart a ſecret impreſſion by which
he is drawn to know him, ſo that if he
faile in his knowledge, or adores him
not as he ought, he is wholly inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Nevertheleſs, we have been alwaies
wanting herein from the beginning of
the world. People have with paſſion
framed Idols, and changed the glory of
God which is incorruptible, into the
reſemblance of a man ſubject to corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
&amp;, that which is more execrable,
into the formes of Birds, Four-footed
beaſts, &amp; Serpents. They have made of
every creature an object of abominable
worſhip, and preſented to the Devils ſo
infamous ſacrifices as modeſty forbids
me to name. You, O <hi>Felix,</hi> are come
from a city where you have ſeen with
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:170075:138"/>
your eyes that which I tell you; for
<hi>Rome</hi> is as well the ſeat of Idolairy, as
of the Empire. The Creator thus offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
has puniſhed this ſin committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, by permitting the moſt
part of men to fall into other execrable
ſ<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ns in all parts of the world. He has
abandoned them to the deſires of their
heart; he has left them to follow their
ignominious and brutiſh paſſions, ſo to
pollute their bodies by ſtrange impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
that in diſhonouring them, they
have unawares revenged the honour
they robbed from God by their impiety.
Men and Women have violated their
honours by deteſtable loves. Amongſt
neareſt allies has been ſeen nothing but
enmities, envy, jealouſie, and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels.
Children have been diſobedient
to their parents, Fathers have loſt the
love which they owe to their children <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
in ſumme, the earth has beheld nothing
but iniquity, malice, covetouſneſs, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
ſlanders, falſe accuſations, ſtrifes,
warres, murders, Parricides, Robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:170075:139"/>
and ſacriledges. During this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
darkneſs, the <hi>Jewes</hi> have been a
little enlightned; <hi>Moyſes,</hi> by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
of God, inſtructed them
what they owe to him as their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign,
and to men as their Brethren.
He has given them a holy law to draw
them to good by reward, and to divert
them from evil by the threats of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.
But many are content to
heare this law, yet care not to obſerve
it; others that have kept it are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
proud, and have attributed to
themſelves the glory of their good
works, inſtead of referring it to God.
Thus all men were found to be ſlaves to
ſin, and worthy of death, which is the
price of ſin. Concupiſcence raigned
abſolutely over them, and at every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſoyled them after ſome new man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
In this unhappy condition, God
had pity on humane nature, ſeeing,
that Philoſophy could not cure the
Gentiles, nor the Law thoſe who made
profeſſion of it. All being intangled in
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:170075:139"/>
infidelity as in nets he ſent down his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſon, to the end, that by his bloud he
ſhouldleffect that which was impoſſible for
the law to do, &amp; that be himſelf ſhould
be given up for the redemption of all, as
a holy and acceptable victime to God.
This he has wrought by dying upon the
Croſs, whereunto he was faſtned by the
envy of the Prieſts ſuborning the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
ſo that by how much it has been
heretofore infamous, by ſo much the
more is it now glorious and adorable.
This is the Tree on which we muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
be ingraffed, if we will have
true life. Jeſus Chriſt is dead, to the
end we ſhould die with him, and if this
death be real and compleat, we are
aſſured to live eternally in his ſociety;
for he now is living at the right hand
of his Father, who raiſed him the third
day. There are many now alive wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
of this, and their depoſition can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
well be ſuſpected; for they are not
weak perſons eaſily to be deceived, not
intereſſed in it, to deceive others. Theſe
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:170075:140"/>
who publiſh this verity, can hope for
nothing at preſent but chaines, perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions,
priſons, and all ſorts of infamy.
It diſtaſtes all that hear it, and paſſes
for a kinde of madneſs. Thoſe then
certainly who defend it with ſo much
conſtancy, and who are otherwiſe irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provable
in their manner of life, ought
to be believed as faithfull Miniſters of
God, and not reputed as abſurd impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors.
For my ſelfe, I ſpeak as an eye
witneſs: Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> hath
vouchſafed to appear unto me, although
I be but as an abortive, and not worthy
the name of an Apoſtle, having ſo much

when he brought the people into
the land of Promiſe; and in ſo many
other things of our Law as were too te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
to relate. He excludes no perſon
from ſalvation, nor chooſes out one Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
more then another, but by faith
he will juſtifie all ſorts of perſons, great,
little, Kings, Subjects, rich, poore, ſo
that all may come to eternall life. I do
require of you a thing that is not very
hard, believe, and you ſhall receive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency:
Believe, and you ſhall live;
for faith is the life of the juſt mans
ſoul. Hee that lives this liſe is not
troubled to ſubmit to what the Law
preſcribes; for he knowes that he is a
member conſecrated to God, and ſo not
to be ſoyled in Formcation, much leſs
in Adultery: Other ſinnes, which we
commit, are without us, but when wee
are given to impurity, we ſinne againſt
our ſelves, againſt our owne bodies'
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:170075:141"/>
which we diſhonour, and which is not
made for that uſe, but to be a Temple
of the holy Ghoſt. From the beginning
of the world, God inſtituted marriage
for the propagation of mankinde: hee
bleſt man and woman, and ſaid, They
were two in one fleſh, but they muſt be
carefull to poſſeſs their bodies in ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and not ſuffer them to follow the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
of Concupiſcence, and thoſe
Brutalities which are common amongſt
Gentiles. Their bed is holy, and their
conjunction, not onely lawfull but hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.
Death onely can diſsolve them;
for that which God hath united, who
can or dare ſeparate? From thence
therefore judge, what a horrible crime
Adultery is, which makes this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union,
and at the ſame time offends
both God and the Husband. Man
ſometimes is conſtrained by force
to endure ſo great an injury, and God
bears a long time with thoſe who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
it: But when the meaſure of their
iniquity is filled, when they have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

thing, <hi>Felix,</hi> to fall into the hands
of the living God: He is a Judge not
to be deceived; for hee reads in the
depth of hearts, and makes the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

neither the reformation of the

<hi>Felix</hi> would have had money<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and

<pb n="273" facs="tcp:170075:142"/>
told them, He meant to
ſtay onely a few daies at <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi>
that therefore they ſhould meet
him at <hi>Ceſarea,</hi> where he would
hear their accuſations, and do them
juſtice. They obeyed this his order,
&amp; coming to the appointed place,
repeated with much heat thoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations,
which before they had
depoſed, without any more proofe
this ſecond time, then they had
done at the firſt. The Apoſtle an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
likewiſe in his defence the
ſame as before; and <hi>Feſtus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
deſirous to gratifie the <hi>Jews,</hi>
though at the coſt of the Apoſtles
innocency and life, asked him if he
were not willing to go to <hi>Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
to be judged there by him. He
anſwered, <q>No; and that he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed
to the Tribunal of <hi>Caeſar,</hi>
for if I have offended him, as I am
accuſed, or done harm to any, 'tis
there I will ſuffer death. But if I
be innocent of theſe crimes,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:170075:143"/>
wherewith I am charged, as I
maintain I am, and as you your
ſelves well know, no man can
oblige me to ſuffer my ſelf to be
judged by my Adverſaries. And
I appeal to the ſupream Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Caeſar.</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <hi>Feſtus</hi> ſurpriſed with
this diſcourſe, and having mature<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conſidered what he were beſt to
do in this occaſion, was enforced to
tell him, <hi>Thou haſt appealed to Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,
before him thou ſhalt go.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At that time, young <hi>Agrippa</hi> came
to <hi>Ceſarea,</hi> to ſalute <hi>Portius Feſtus,</hi>
together with his Siſter <hi>Berenice,</hi>
who had eſpouſed in her firſt nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptials
<hi>Herod</hi> her Unckle, King of
<hi>Chalcides,</hi> and in her ſecond mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
<hi>Polemon,</hi> little King of <hi>Cilicia.</hi>
This young Prince was not above
ſeventeen yeares of age, when his
Father, of whoſe death we have
ſpoken in the firſt Book, left him
the Scepter. The Emperour <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi>
at whoſe Court he then was
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:170075:143"/>
conſerved to him all the eſtates of
his Father, except <hi>Iudea,</hi> which he
durſt not truſt in his hands, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of his youth and the turbulent
humor of the <hi>Iewes.</hi> But <hi>Nero</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to them many little Provinces.
Some dayes after his arrival, <hi>Feſtus</hi>
ſpake to him of the Apoſtle, told
him all that had paſſed concerning
that buſineſs, and that it was now
ſuſpended, becauſe of his appeal to
<hi>Ceſar. Agrippa</hi> was very glad of the
newes, for the reputation of S. <hi>Paul</hi>
had made him a long time deſirous
to ſee him. At the day appointed
he came to the place ordained for
publick audience in the company
of his Siſter <hi>Berenice,</hi> with whom
the common rumor famed him to
have greater familiarity then hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
permitted. The Apoſtle was
brought thither, and <hi>Feſtus</hi> ſhewing
him to <hi>Agrippa</hi> ſaid, <q>This is
the man of whom I ſpake to you,
and againſt whom the <hi>Iewes</hi> were
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:170075:144"/>
ſo fiercely bent, as they ſought
his ruine by all maner of means,
although for my part I finde him
not guilty of any crime. In fine,
I intended to ſend him to <hi>Caeſar,</hi>
to whom he hath appealed, but
being ignorant what to write in
this affaire, it concerning ſome
point of Religion, about a certain
man named Jeſus of Nazareth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
whom the accuſed affirmes to be
riſen againe after his death, and
whom the <hi>Iewes</hi> on the other ſide
condemned as an Impoſtor. I am
very willing to have him ſpeak
before ſo noble an Aſſembly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
before a Prince well verſed in all
thoſe queſtions.</q> Hereupon, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa</hi>
made ſign to the Apoſtle that
he ſhould defend himſelf, which he
did in this manner.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>It is no ſmall conſolation to
me, King <hi>Agrippa,</hi> that I am to
ſpeak this day before you, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to the accuſations of my e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:170075:144"/>
becauſe you are perfectly
inſtructed in all the queſtions of
the Law, whereof I am accuſed to
be a publick enemy. Hence alſo I
aſſure my ſelf, that you by your
piety, being intereſſed in this
cauſe, will afford me a favorable
hearing. Me thinks I ought to be
the leaſt ſuſpected of any perſon
to be guilty of this crime where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
I am charged. For if my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers
would but acknowledge
the truth, they will know in what
manner I have lived in <hi>Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
all the time of my youth, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
thoſe of my Nation. I
was brought up under the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> which is
the ſect the moſt pure &amp; of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
authority in our Religion, &amp;
I do not believe to have done any
thing contrary to the rules of my
Profeſſion, which might give the
leaſt occaſion to feare the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of men, if there were que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:170075:145"/>
of my behaviour. But all
my pretended crime hath relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to my beliefe, and I finde my
ſelf reduced to a neceſſity of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
my ſelf in publique, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I place my hope in him,
who was promiſed to our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Fathers;
and from whom I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
my ſalvation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as they have
done ſerving God day and night,
and carefully obſerving all the
precepts which he gave unto them
for that end. Now this hope
does not terminate in this life;
it is accompliſhed in the other, by
the reſurrection of the body,
which places man in a glorious
State, where he is to receive the
recompence of his good deeds,
and the accompliſhment of that
ſalvation, which has been here the
ſubject of hope: Behold a ſecond
crime raiſed againſt me by ſome,
who following the principles of
their Sect, deny what I believe,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:170075:145"/>
and what I teach concerning this
point of the reſurrection. What is
there in it, that ſeems to you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible?
who dares ſay God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
reſtore life to the dead? who
had the power to give life when
he placed them in the world? For
the firſt point of my accuſation,
I confeſs I have had opinions far
different from that of which they
would now make me guilty. For
ſometime I believed as others
did, that I ought to do all things
to the diſhonour of Jeſus of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth,</hi>
and the more I ſhewed my
rage againſt his name, the more
notice was taken of my piety.
The city of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> is witneſs
of the violences I uſed; I made
ſearch in all places after thoſe
who profeſſed that doctrin; I have
caſt many of them into priſon,
by authority from the Princes of
the Prieſts to that effect; and
when they have been condemned
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:170075:146"/>
to death, I have not only by my
vote approved the ſentence to be
juſt, but have been the bearer of
it. I went to all the Synagogues,
endeavouring ſometimes by
force, and ſometimes by Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems,
to make thoſe who had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
the belief of the Goſpel,
to renounce it; and I eſteemed it
a great victory, when I could
corrupt any diſciple of J. Chriſt.
I deſerved to have continued in
my blindeneſs, and to have found
in the end the juſt puniſhment of
my cruelty, which extended it
ſelf even to forrain and remote
Cities. But he, whom I perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
had compaſſion of my igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
&amp; would, in ſhewing mercy
to me, ſhew to all ſinners the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of his goodneſs and long
patience. I went to <hi>Damaſco</hi> to
impriſon all thoſe who believed
in him, and in the way, about
noon, a great light environed
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:170075:146"/>
me, and thoſe who were in my
company; we all fell to the
ground, and I heard a voice that
ſpake to mee in the Hebrew
tongue: Saul, Saul, <hi>Why doeſt
thou perſecute me? It is in vaine
to kicke againſt the prickes. I
anſwered, Who are you Lord?</hi>
The Lord replied, <hi>I am Jeſus of</hi>
Nazareth <hi>whom thou doeſt perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute;
but, ariſe, and ſtand upon thy
feet; I have appeared to thee, to the
end I may ordain thee a preacher of
thoſe things thou haſt ſeen, &amp; make
thee boldly to render publike teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
in all places of the world, both
of theſe and other verities which I
will in due time reveale unto thee.
Be not affraid, I will deliver thee
from the ambuſhes and violence of
the people, unto whom I ſend thee,
that thou mayeſt open their eyes, and
reduce them from that deplorable
ſiate of darkneſs in which they are,
unto the light of my Goſpel; that
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:170075:147"/>
thou mayeſt free them from the power
of the devil, and place them under
the protection of God, to the end, they
may from his goodneſs receive remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of their ſinnes, and ſhare in the
inheritance of Saints, by a firm faith
in my name.</hi> I rejected not by a
misbelief, O King <hi>Agrippa,</hi> this
heavenly viſion; for preſently I
began to preach to the <hi>Jewes</hi> of
<hi>Damaſco,</hi> and afterwards at <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi>
and in <hi>Judea,</hi> and then
to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> exhorting them to
return to God by a true conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of heart, and to do workes
worthy of pennance, not to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the poſſeſſion of a land flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with milk and honey, &amp; ſuch
other recompences as are promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by a carnall Law; but to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the fruition of heaven, which
is infallible to thoſe who live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Maxims of Jeſus
Chriſt. This Doctrine is not
new, I have deduced it from the
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:170075:147"/>
writings of <hi>Moyſes,</hi> and thoſe of
the Prophets, who all ſpeak
clearly of the ſufferings of the
<hi>Meſſias,</hi> of his ignominious death,
and of the glory of his reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
in which order, he with
great reaſon holds the firſt place,
ſince hee is the firſt-born of God
before all creatures. He is begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in light, and he is come into
the world to enlighten the <hi>Jewes</hi>
and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> &amp; to make of them
but one people, or rather one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
of which he is the head, diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
admirable influences of a
new life amongſt his members;
for he is the new man, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyes
the old in us, and who
brings us all ſorts of benedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as the other had brought us
all manner of miſeries: it is he,
after whom all our Fore-fathers
have fighted; it is he, who has ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
upon him that curſe to which
the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> were ſubject;  it
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:170075:148"/>
is he, who upon the tree of the
Croſs has aboliſhed the fatal ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of death in which all men
were engaged. The Law of <hi>M<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
had truly Sacrifices to expiate
ſin, but that expiation was but
exteriour; the bloud of Goats
and Bulls could not purifie the
hearts of thoſe that offered it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt has
this divine vertue; and indeed it
is onely hee that has taken away
all the ſins of the world. It was
needfull to re-iterate the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
of the Temple, but this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Prieſt, of whom I ſpeak, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
once offered, hath drawn dry
the very ſource of ſinne, has for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
taken away that, which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
ſanctification; has appeaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the divine Juſtice, &amp; opened to
himſelf &amp; to his members a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Sanctuary, which till then
was ſhut up. This was figured by
the high Prieſts entering once a
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:170075:148"/>
year into the material Sanctuary,
with the bloud of a Goat offered
for his own and the peoples ſins;
for, all that, which our Fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
beheld, was in figure. God
would diſpoſe them by carnall
things unto ſpiritual, &amp; by ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes,
conduct them to the light
which his Son was to bring to the
world in the fulneſs of time,
where he has contracted an alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
incomparably more holy
and more glorious then was the
firſt. Hear what a Prophet ſpeaks
a long time before his coming:
<hi>Behold,</hi> (ſayes hee) <hi>the dayes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
in which I will make a new
alliance with the houſe of</hi> Iſrael <hi>and</hi>
Juda, <hi>far different from that which
I contracted with their fathers, when
I withdrew them from the bondage
of Egypt: They were not faithfull
in the obſervation of my Law; they
mocked at it, and I treating them
as they treated me, have ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:170075:149"/>
them. The teſtament which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
to the Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>is, that
I will grave my ordinances in their
hearts; I wil be their God, &amp; they ſhal
be my people; they ſhall not need any
laborious ſtudy or ſerious conſultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
with learned Maſters, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
in my Truthes, becauſe I will
be their Tutour, and by an interiour
unction, will teach them all I would
have them to know; ſo that one
neighbour ſhall not teach another
with trouble; and one ſhall not ſay to
another, Doeſt thou know the Lord?
becauſe, from the leaſt to the greateſt,
all ſhall perfectly know me: &amp; I will
remit their offences with ſo full a
pardon, that I will not ſo much as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
them.</hi> Behold, in this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
hee ſpeakes of a new teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
the old then is to be
aboliſhed, and conſequently an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
is to ſucceed; and to the
end there ſhould be ſome reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
betwixt them, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:170075:149"/>
this ſhould be confirmed
by the bloud of the Teſtatour, as
that was given with a ceremony
of bloud, when <hi>Moyſes</hi> ſprinkled
the people, ſaying, <hi>This is the
bloud with the which the Lord con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
his alliance, which he hath this
day contracted with you.</hi> Behold,
great Prince, that which I preach;
Behold, how I deſtroy the Law;
Behold, how I am an enemy to

               <p>
                  <hi>Feſtus,</hi> unable to comprehend the
ſublime diſcourſe of the Apoſtle,
interrupted him, and called out, O
<hi>Paul,</hi> thy great learning doth make
thee mad, thou doeſt utter extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
things. The Apoſtle humbly
anſwered, <q>I ſpeak nothing that
is extravagant; what I propoſe,
is truth, and the King who has
daigned me his attention, perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
knowes thoſe things which I
have ſaid. For what concerns Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, his life was ſo publick,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:170075:150"/>
and ſo famous, and the wonders
he hath wrought, ſo lately done,
that there is not any amongſt the
<hi>Jewes</hi> who can be ignorant of
them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Having ſpoken thus to <hi>Feſtus,</hi> he
addreſſed himſelf to the King, and

Agrippa, touched in his conſcience,

S. <hi>Paul</hi> replied; <hi>I would to

Captain of the firſt company of a

accompanied the Apoſtle, S. <hi>Luke</hi>
alſo followed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> him in this voyage,
the paſſages whereof hee hath
carefully ſet down. The next day
after their departure, they arrived
at <hi>Sidon,</hi> where the Apoſtle, with
leave of his Conductor, who uſed
him very civilly, viſited the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of that town, and repoſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:170075:151"/>
a little. After their departure
from thence, a contrary winde for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the marriners to ſlack their
courſe, and coaſt the Iſland of <hi>Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus.</hi>
They paſſed the ſea of <hi>Cilicia</hi>
and <hi>Pamphilia,</hi> &amp; landed at <hi>Lyſtris,</hi>
a town of <hi>Licia,</hi> where they found a
veſſel of <hi>Alexandria</hi> that was bound
for <hi>Italy: Iulius</hi> imbarked his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
in her, &amp; [the weather proved
ſo foule, as they had much adoe to
get ſo farre as <hi>Gnidos,</hi> which obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
them to ſteer for <hi>Crete.</hi> They
firſt reached a Promontory called
<hi>Salmon,</hi> which lyes Eaſtward; from
thence they ſailed towards the
South part of the Iſland, and caſt
anchor at a place called <hi>Bonport,</hi>
which is neer to a little town of
<hi>Theſſaly.</hi> The many difficulties
which occurred, had made them let
ſlip much time, ſo that the ſeaſon,
apt to tempeſts, overtook them, and
rendered navigation very danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
In the Acts of the Apoſtles S.
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:170075:151"/>
                  <hi>Luke</hi> ſayes, <hi>the dayes of faſting were
paſt;</hi> but he not ſpecifying what
<hi>faſt,</hi> and Interpreters much differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in their opinions upon this
ſubject, wee cannot from thence
draw any light whereby to know
preciſely the time when the Apoſtle
put to ſea. Many hold, that it was
in the beginning of Winter, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the moneth of <hi>December</hi> or <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary,</hi>
in which falls the tenth faſt
of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> for the deſtruction of
the Temple, during the captivity
of <hi>Babylon.</hi> Others hold, that he
meanes the Faſt which falls in the
moneth of <hi>September,</hi> becauſe that
was the moſt ſolemn, &amp; which was
called the Faſt <hi>per excellentiam.</hi> This
I account the moſt probable, and
if we follow it, then the time ſhould
be about the beginning or end of
<hi>October.</hi> The Commander would
have them put againe to ſea, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the Apoſtle told
them they ſhould run the hazzard
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:170075:152"/>
of ſhipwrack. But he not knowing
that S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake from a cleerer
light then the art of Navigation,
thought the harbor where they lay
not ſafe, and that it was neceſſary
to remove to another, called <hi>Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nix,</hi>
which lay towards the South,
and was ſubject onely to South
and South-Weſt windes, which are
gentle, and more tolerable in the
Winter. This reſolution being fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
they hoiſed ſail, and went
from <hi>Aſſon</hi> with a favourable gale
at firſt; but preſently the winde
turned about North-Eaſt, and blew
ſo ſtrong, as the Pilot being forced
to let goe the helm, the ſhip was
carried againſt a little Iſland which
lyes direct Weſt unto <hi>Crete,</hi> at this
day called <hi>Goſa.</hi> There they
thought to take the Cock-boat, &amp;
endeavour to ſtay the ſhip with
cords and anchors, leſt ſhe ſhould
runne her ſelfe upon the bankes of
ſand. But, to do that, they muſt firſt
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:170075:152"/>
take down Maſt and Sails; and the
ſtorm encreaſing, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
to caſt all the merchandiſe,
and a good part of their proviſion,
and all their armes into the ſea,
to lighten the ſhip. They were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of the light of the Sun and
Stars by a profound darkneſs. The
waves roared and went higher and
higher, and there appeared all the
ſigns of a moſt horrid tempeſt nigh
at hand; ſo that the maſters are
now uſeleſs, there was no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
but to the aſſiſtance of God.
There the Apoſtle placed his hope,
and deſirous to encourage the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed
hearts of thoſe that were in
the ſhip, he told them, <q>They
need not fear, for that the Angel
of God whom he ſerved had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
to him in the night, &amp; aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him that none of thoſe who
were in his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany ſhould periſh.
The Lord, to whom the windes
are obedient, having granted
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:170075:153"/>
their ſafety to his prayers; for
himſelf he knew he ſhould infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
be preſented to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and
that they ſhould all come ſafe to
an Iſland. In fine, he was aſſured,
that what he told them by Gods
appointment, would infallibly
happen; wherefore he deſired
them to be of good courage.</q>
They had been fourteen dayes in
continual fear of ſhipwrack, when
this man of God ſpake thus to
them; and, not long after, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
ſome ſparks of hope, that his
prediction might prove true. For,
the night following, the Marriners
thought they ſaw land, and ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
they found they had not above
twenty fadomes of water, and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
farther not fifteen. This made
them apprehend the daſhing upon
a rock, and obliged them to caſt
out foure anchors ſo to ſtay the
veſſel. Every one was impatient
for day, that they might better diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:170075:153"/>
things: but whileſt the paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
were at their prayers, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners
thought to get in the Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boat,
and ſo to ſave themſelves. S.
<hi>Paul</hi> perceiving this, told the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and the Souldiers, that <hi>if thoſe
men ſtayed not in the ſhip, they ſhould
all certainly periſh.</hi> The Captain
believed him, and forthwith cut the
cable of the boat, letting it go whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the tide and winde would car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
it. At laſt the long deſired light
of day appeared. Then the Apoſtle
adviſed every one to take ſome
ſuſtenance, and, to give them exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
he brake a loaf the firſt; and,
after he had given God thanks, he
are of it with ſo ſaintly a joy, as all
thoſe who were in the veſſel (and
the text of the Acts ſayes, they were
in all two hundred threeſcore and
twelve perſons) were ſo comforted
and filled with a ſecret aſſurance
of coming ſafe to land, as they
could not but expreſs it. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:170075:154"/>
perceiving a little bay, they
reſolved to guide the ſhip into it,
if it were poſſible; hence waying
their anchors, and plying the helm,
they left onely the top ſail up, and
ſo left the ſhip to the winde and
tide to gain the ſhore. But their
project did not hit, for they fell
upon a neck of land which advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
into the ſea, &amp; there every one
gave himſelfe for loſt; for on the
one ſide the prow was ſtruck ſo far
into the ſand that there was no
moving it, and on the other ſide
the poup was ſhattered to pieces by
the violence of the waves. Then
the Souldiers thought to fall upon
the Priſoners and kill them, leſt
they ſhould make an eſcape: but
the Captain, who deſired to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
S. <hi>Paul,</hi> hindered them from
executing that barbarous reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and commanded thoſe that
could ſwim to get firſt to ſhore,
and for the reſt they made paſſage
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:170075:154"/>
for them with boards and plancks,
ſo that they all gat ſafe to land: a
while after, being come to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
they found the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt
had drove them upon the
Iſland of <hi>Malta.</hi> It was at that time
inhabited with <hi>Barbarians,</hi> but ſuch
as were very humane, who received
them with much charity and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie,
making fires to dry them.
Whileſt every one brought wood
for their proviſion, the Apoſtle
took up an armfull of ſticks, from
whence (by Gods permiſſion, who
would have him thereby known)
a viper iſſuing forth, faſtned upon
his hand, &amp; there hung; the Iſland<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
according to their feeble un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
judged him to be ſome
wicked man, whom the divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
had ſaved from the fury of the
ſea, to puniſh more exemplarly &amp;
rigorouſly at land: But, when they
beheld him to ſhake the viper into
the fire, and that he had no harm
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:170075:155"/>
by the biting of it. As the mindes
of the Vulgar in the ſame moment
are capable of different impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
they preſently took him for a
God hidden under a humane form.
The marvelous cure of <hi>Publius</hi> his
Father, Prince of that Iſland, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
by a ſtrong Fever and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entery,
increaſed their reſpect and
eſteem of his ſanctity, and cauſed
them to bring to him, from all
parts, diſeaſed perſons, whom he
reſtored to health, by invocating
the name of Jeſus Chriſt. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
there many to the faith, and,
at this day, it is the Bulwark a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the fury of the Turks, who
finde it a ſtubborn rock to reſiſt
their power, by the viſible prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of God. He ſtayed there three
moneths, and at the end departed
thence in a veſſel of <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
which had wintred there. The
winde was favourable to them till
they came to <hi>Syracuſa,</hi> where they
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:170075:155"/>
tarried three dayes; from thence,
coaſting along the land, they got
to <hi>Regium,</hi> and the next day arrived
at <hi>Putzeoli.</hi> They found Chriſtians
there who conjured him to ſtay
ſeven dayes with them, to which
he eaſily condeſcended, in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
of their charity, and of
the honour which they had done
him. The report of his arrival be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſpread through <hi>Rome,</hi> moſt of
the faithfull that dwelt there, came
to meet him; ſome as farre as the
market place of <hi>Appius,</hi> and others
to a ſtructure called the Three Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns,
the ſight of them afforded
him great conſolation. He, with
them, entered into this great City,
which one may call the ſeat of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry,
as well as of the Empire,
&amp;, in whoſe converſion, that of the
whole world was included. So
great a worke required a zeale no
leſs ardent, and a minde no leſs
cleare, then that of the Apoſtle,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:170075:156"/>
whom God had ordained, together
with S. <hi>Peter</hi> by their preaching, to
found the principal Church upon
earth, to cultivate it by their cares,
and, as we ſhall ſee a little after, to
conſecrate it with their bloud. The
Captain who conducted him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
him, with the reſt of his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners,
into the hands of the Prefect
of the Pretorium, who was named
<hi>Burrus;</hi> this man was content to
allow the Apoſtle a ſouldier for his
guard, ſo that though he was not
intirely free, yet he might go whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he pleaſed with his guard, who
was faſtned to him with the ſame
chain, as the cuſtom was, but ſo as
it hindered him not from walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
he by that meanes with faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
declared the Goſpel to the
<hi>Jewes</hi> &amp; <hi>Gentiles</hi> that lived in <hi>Rome.</hi>
He began firſt with the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and
the third day after his arrival, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
the principal of them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and told them, <q>That he
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:170075:156"/>
was made Priſoner at <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi>
and put into the hands of the
<hi>Romanes</hi> by thoſe of his own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
although he was not guilty
of any crime, either in word or
deed, againſt any particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
or againſt the Law. That
the hatred and fury of his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers
conſtrained him to appeale
to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> that he came thither to
preſent himſelf, not to accuſe his
Country-men, but onely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
his owne innocency: That
he found his chain very pleaſing,
ſince he bore it for declaring the
coming of him who was the
hope of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and that he might
give them an account of all
things, hee defired them they
would come unto him. They
anſwered him, they had received
no letters from <hi>Judea,</hi> nor ſeen
any body that had made the leaſt
complaint againſt him; and, for
the reſt, they deſired him hee
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:170075:157"/>
would freely tell them what this
new Sect was which he preached,
and which they underſtood was
generally oppoſed with great
contradiction.</q> The Apoſtle, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
then to ſatisfie their deſires
appointed them another day, when
he ſhould have more time to expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
ſo highly important verities.
They failed not to come to this
conference, and when every one
had taken his place, S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake
much after this manner.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Brethren, in the ſubject you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to be inſtructed, it is a great
advantage to me, and likewiſe a
great conſolation, that I am not
obliged to prove the principles to
you, from which I am to draw my
Conſequences. You receive <hi>Moſes</hi>
for the Law giver, and with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
eſteem his words as Oracles.
Certainly it is moſt reaſonable
we ſhould hearken to him whom
God treated with ſo much
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:170075:157"/>
familiarity upon the Mountain,
and by whom he hath wrought ſo
many wonders in favour of our
fore-fathers. We muſt onely be
careful that we go not contrary
to the intentions of this great
man: He hath been faithful in the
houſe of God, but it has been in
quality of a Servant. He hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
to the people the will of
the eternal Father, but as Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter.
He has eſtabliſhed Purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
and ſacrifices, but it was
onely for that time (according as
providence had ordained) which
was to preceed the birth of the
new Law giver whom I preach,
and who is no other then Jeſus
Chriſt. It is he Brethren, by whom
God hath vouchſafed to ſpeake to
us in theſe laſt ages, having ſpoken
in the former by the Prophets, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
divers manners. This is the
Son to the Father of that Family,
whereof <hi>Moſes</hi> is a member. This
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:170075:158"/>
is the truth of all our figures, the
end of the whole body of the
Law, the object of all the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies.
His death was figured in that
of <hi>Abell,</hi> whoſe innocent blood
<hi>Cain</hi> ſpilt througy a raging jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie.
<hi>Moſes,</hi> in delivering our
Anceſtors from the bondage of
<hi>Egypt,</hi> repreſents the exemption
from the tyranny of ſin and
death, wrought by him, whom I
preach unto you. The brazen
Serpent erected in the Deſart,
which was a Cure for the biting
of real Serpents, teacheth us, that
the Son of man was to be lifted up
from the Earth, and placed upon
the Croſs, and that he ſhould
prove a ſaving Phyſitian to the
Mortal deſeaſe of humane nature.
The immolation of the Paſchal
Lamb, the ſacrifice of the Goat
emiſſary, on whom were charged
all the ſins of the people, were the
images of his bloody oblation,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:170075:158"/>
which hath opened us the way to
eternal life, and which has expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
all the ſins of the world. The
Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſeems to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
it with his eyes; and, unleſs
you will blind your ſelves, you
muſt acknowledge that which he
ſpake <hi>of a Virgin that ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
and bring forth a Son, who
ſhould be the light, the hope, the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
the Maſter, and King of Nations,
in whom the Spirit of Wiſedome,
Counſel, and Force, ſhould reſide,
whoſe feet, and hands ſhould be pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced;
who ſhould be made a man of
dolours, a man chaſtiſed by God for
the ſins of his people, and in whom
neither beauty nor comlineſſe ſhould
appear; inſomuch, that his very
bones might be told; and lots ſhould
be caſt for his garment.</hi> Is not this
Jeſus, whoſe doctrine I preach un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you? This is the Maſter whom
<hi>David</hi> invites us to hear, ſpeaking
in the perſon of God. <hi>To day if
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:170075:159"/>
you hear his voice, harden not your
hearts, as your Fore-fathers have
done in the deſart; where I was made
angry againſt thoſe who durſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt
my power, and cenſure all my
workes for the ſpace of forty yeares.
Their infidelity ſhall not go unpuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed;
I will make them know, that I
can revenge my ſelf, &amp; in my wrath
I ſweare they ſhall not enter into the
place of reſt which I had prepared
for them.</hi> Behold, dreadfull
words, and you will doe well to
be warned by their loſs, leſt you
be excluded alſo from that place
of repoſe which is offered to you.
As it availed them little to give
ear to the relation of thoſe who
returned from the land of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
and informed them of the
true ſtate of it, becauſe they would
not believe what was ſaid; ſo it
is not enough to heare the Goſpel
preached, it muſt be received hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
to the end you may obtaine
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:170075:159"/>
by faith the fruition of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
which is ſpoken of in the
paſſage I alledged. It cannot be
that repoſe which God aſſumed,
after he had made the world, that
being no other thing then a ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
from work; nor is it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
the repoſe of the Sabbath,
whoſe inſtitution was before the
birth of <hi>David.</hi> In ſumme, it is
not that repoſe which our Fathers
taſted in the Land whereinto they
were led by <hi>Ioſhua;</hi> for that long
ſince is paſt: therefore, it muſt
needs be, that the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks
of another repoſe more holy, a
Sabbath more excellent, which
appertains to the people of God,
and, in which the Juſt do eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
repoſe from all their labours,
as formerly our Lord did repoſe
the ſeventh day from all his
works. <hi>Moyſes</hi> could not bring us
into that place where this divine
Sabbath is celebrated: Jeſus
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:170075:160"/>
Chriſt entred there the firſt, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
it to thoſe who ſhould receive
his doctrine. This is the Prieſt
deſerving adoration, who, to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
heaven and earth, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
man to God, has not
not made uſe of the bloud of
goats and bulls, but of his owne,
which he has ſhed to the laſt drop
upon the Altar of the Croſs. The
high Prieſt of the Law was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to offer Sacrifices for his own
ſins, as well as thoſe of the People.
Jeſus Chriſt is the Sovereign high
Prieſt, pure, holy, unpolluted, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of any ſpot, &amp; conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
needs not offer any victime for
himſelf: he hath not received his
Prieſt-hood by way of a carnall
birth and ſucceſſion, as the Prieſts
according to <hi>Aaron</hi> did; but hee
has been eſtabliſhed eternal Prieſt
according to the order of <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedec,</hi>
as we learn by thoſe words
of the Pſalmiſt, which you confeſs
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:170075:160"/>
are to be underſtood of the Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as;
<hi>Our Lord hath ſworne thou art
an eternal Prieſt according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of</hi> Melchiſedec. If the Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Prieſt-hood, which the people
received together with the Law,
guided to perfection, that is to
ſay, gave true Juſtice, what need
was there that another Prieſt
ſhould come according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of <hi>Melchiſedec?</hi> and if the
Prieſt-hood be transferred, it then
follows that the Law is alſo chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
becauſe theſe two things are
inſeparably linked together. Now
that there has been a tranſlation
of the Prieſt-hood, 'tis not to be
doubted, ſince he, of whom that
paſſage I alledged, ſpeaks, was of
the Tribe of <hi>Iuda,</hi> and not of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi,</hi>
out of which <hi>Moyſes</hi> ordained
that the Prieſts ſhould be choſen.
Obſerve, alſo that the Leviticall
Prieſt-hood was not eſtabliſhed
by oath, as is that which I treat;
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:170075:161"/>
and this circumſtance ſhewes the
ſanctity and immutability of that
thing unto which God has pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to unite it. There were to be
many Prieſts, according to the
order of <hi>Aaron,</hi> becauſe they were
mortal. But the Prieſt-hood of
Jeſus Chriſt is eternall as well as
himſelf; he has alwaies power to
guide thoſe to eternall ſalvation
who believe in him. He is alwaies
in the functions of his Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
that is to ſay, in continual
oblation of himſelf to God, and
in prayer without intermiſſion;
for hee that ſayes Eternal Prieſt,
ſayes alſo Eternal Oblation. The
Levitical Prieſts ſtood during the
exerciſe of their Functions; Jeſus
Chriſt having once offered the
Hoaſt of his body, is ſeated at the
right hand of God, according to
the words of the Pſalmiſt; <hi>The
Lord ſaid to my Lord, Take thy
place, till I have put thy enemies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:170075:161"/>
my feet.</hi> Be not you of that
number, my deare Brethren, you
that are deſcended from <hi>Abraham</hi>
the Father of the Faithfull, you
whoſe Anceſtours have been ſo
holy, you to whom thoſe promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
were made, and for whom Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt principally came; doe
not permit ſtrangers to carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the benediction due to law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
children, and having hitherto
born the heavy yoke of <hi>Moyſes,</hi>
doe not fear now to ſubmit your
ſelvs to that of Jeſus Chriſt, which
is ſo light and pleaſing: And in
this you will even obey <hi>Moyſes,</hi> by
whom (as you know) God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed,
That after many ages hee
would raiſe a Prophet of your
Nation, to whom hee would have
you attend as to himſelf.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Apoſtle ſpake much after
this manner, &amp; his diſcourſe raiſed
great Diſputes amongſt his Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours;
ſome blaming what others
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:170075:162"/>
approved, ſome believing, others
continuing obſtinate. S.</hi> Paul <hi>find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hee could gaine little upon
them, hee told them freely;</hi> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>I
know well, that ye will fulfill the
propheſie of</hi> Eſay, <hi>to whom God
ſpake in theſe tearms,</hi> Goe to the
Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and tell them, You
ſhall hear with your ears but ſhall not
underſtand with your mindes; you
ſhall ſee with the eyes of the body, but
not with thoſe of the ſoule: for the
heart of this people is ſuffocated with
fat; they have heard with their ears
againſt their wills being incenſed, &amp;
have ſhut their eyes, for feare they
ſhould ſee by their eyes, take in by
their eares, conſent by their hearts
and wills, and ſo work their converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and their cure.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The incredulous <hi>Jewes</hi> were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
offended at theſe words,
and more, which he added, <hi>viz.</hi>
That the news of ſalvation ſhould
be carried to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who
would imbrace it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="313" facs="tcp:170075:162"/>
This diſcourſe gave occaſion of
much diſpute to the Audience, who
not being able to come to an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement,
every one returned home
poſſeſſed with different thoughts
and opinions.</p>
               <p>Hitherto we have proceeded ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely,
following the ſteps of Saint
<hi>Luke,</hi> who ends here his ſtory, and
leaves the Apoſtle in the Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Rome,</hi> where he ſaies, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
two years, and during that
time preached the Doctrine of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt without any let, Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
with freedome all thoſe who
came to ſee him. Hence what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
the reſt of his life, we know
little, yet I will endeavour to
ground, what I ſhall adde more of
this Subject, either upon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
traditions, or from his owne
Epiſtles.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond Epiſtle which he
writes to <hi>Tymothy</hi> his dear Diſciple,
he ſaies, that God will deliver him
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:170075:163"/>
from the Jawes of the Lyon, by
which, probably, he meanes <hi>Nero,</hi> to
whom he was preſented for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of his appeal. This Prince
began then the third year of his
Empire, and, whether his wicked
inclinations were yet aſleep, or,
whether the continual exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of <hi>Seneca</hi> his Tutor withheld
him, or, that he diſſembled till his
authority was better ſetled, he gave
the people of <hi>Rome</hi> ſome hope that
under his raigne, they ſhould ſee
a reſemblance of their ancient li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.
<hi>Burrus,</hi> Captain of his guard,
preſenting a ſentence of death to
be figned by him, he cryed out, I
wiſh it pleaſed the gods, I could
not write. This ſpeech begot a
beliefe in men, that he was merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
but it was not long ere he gave
the lye to that opinion: The <hi>Iews,</hi>
to embitter his ſpirit againſt Saint
<hi>Paul,</hi> and to make the worſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
they could, in order to
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:170075:163"/>
his ruine, under colour of Juſtice
and Piety, made uſe of one <hi>Allitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
of their Nation, who had gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
great credit with the Emperor
by his Comoedian Art. But the
Divine Providence fruſtrated their
wicked deſign, and made the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
obtain there a glorious pardon,
where in, humane probability, he
might have expected his condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to an opprobrious death.
The feare of this his danger was ſo
great, as, moſt of thoſe, who before
was his followers eſpecially thoſe
of <hi>Aſia,</hi> abandoned him. Amongſt
theſe cowardly and trayterous di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples,
he names particularly
<hi>Phigellus,</hi> and <hi>Hermogenes;</hi> the laſt
of theſe, <hi>Tertullian</hi> reckons amongſt
the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> Hereticks, who denyed
the Reſurrection. But, at the ſame
time, God ſent him <hi>Onoſiphorus</hi> an
<hi>Epheſian,</hi> who aſſiſted him with
ſo much charity, as he left the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of it to the whole Church, in
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:170075:164"/>
his fore-mentioned Epiſtle. The
Greek Menologue ſaies, he was Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Colophones,</hi> and the Romans
celebrates the memory of him on
the ſixth day of <hi>September.</hi> Beſides
this faithful companion, he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Tichius.</hi> But thoſe
he ſpeedily diſpatched to preach
the Goſpel in divers places, ſo
that his care, as well as authority,
was extended to all the Provinces
of the world; he preferred the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of ſouls, before the comfort
which he might receive by the
company of his Diſciples; nor did
Jeſus Chriſt leave this unintereſſed
zeal without recompence. For at
that ſame time when every one
had abandoned him, he dained to
appear unto him, that he might
fortifie his courage, and reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he acquired much of glory, by
his perſecutions, &amp; the fury of his
enemies which appeared at all the
Tribunals of <hi>Rome,</hi> made way to
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:170075:164"/>
the preaching of the Goſpel in
thoſe places where perhaps no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of laying it open had ever
been given. Many, even of <hi>Nero</hi>'s
houſhold were converted, and the
Apoſtle ſalutes the <hi>Philippians</hi> from
them. Amongſt whom the Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rologue
mentions one <hi>Torpetes,</hi> who
died couragiouſly at <hi>Piſa</hi> in <hi>Tuſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
in defence of that Faith. <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus</hi>
ſpeakes of one <hi>Pomponia Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cina,</hi>
who was accuſed for having
imbraced a forraine Superſtition;
and being turned over to her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
he taking cognizance of the
crime, according to ancient cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes,
declared her innocent.
Now that which this Author calls
forraine Superſtition, is very likely
to be Chriſtianity. I finde alſo
great probability, that <hi>Seneca</hi> and
the Apoſtle were acquainted, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the letters which are ſet
forth under their names be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit,
and very unworthy of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:170075:165"/>
of them. This great Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher
had too nere a relation to
<hi>Nero,</hi> to be ignorant of the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
he had given to a criminal,
whoſe cauſe the <hi>Iewes</hi> by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Solicitation had made
famous. And if he were preſent
when he pleaded, there is no doubt
but the force of his diſcourſe, and
his ſubline arguments might make
him deſirous of a particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with one that preached
ſo new a Doctrine. Some Authors
have ſaid, it was by his meanes
that <hi>Nero</hi> condemned him not to
death, but that is not founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any ſolid proofe, nor ought we
to attribute this marvelous delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
but to the ſecret power of
God over the hearts of Princes, to
incline them as he pleaſe.</p>
               <p>Whileſt Saint <hi>Paul</hi> laboured to
found the Church at <hi>Rome,</hi> he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,
that the <hi>Epheſian</hi> Church
was peſtered with many falſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:170075:165"/>
who corrupted that pure
Doctrine which he had there prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched;
hence he wrote unto them an
excellent Epiſtle, in the which he
principally inſtructs them in the
profound myſtery of predeſtination
and vocation of men to faith, and
Union with Jeſus Chriſt, ſo to
forme an admirable body, of which
he is the Head; and then he treats
of the duty of every faithful man,
according to his condition. A little
after (ſome Authors ſay before, or
at the ſame time) he was not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
with inſtructing the flock
himſelfe, but would alſo give
unto <hi>Tymothy</hi> their Paſtor whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
rules whereby to acquit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
worthily of his charge. I
know many would have this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
to be almoſt the laſt that was
written; but in my opinion their
objections are not conſiderable, &amp;
that the date we aſſign is more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
This difficulty appertains not
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:170075:166"/>
to the ſubject we have in hand; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
we have already explicated it
in the paraphraſe wee made of it.
Towards the end, he deſires him to
come unto him, which he performs,
leaving <hi>Tichius</hi> in his place. The
<hi>Philppians</hi> hearing of the Apoſtles
neceſſity, deputed <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> with
conſiderable alms for his aſſiſtance.
The change of air, with the toiles
of his journey, made him fall ſick
at <hi>Rome:</hi> But S. <hi>Paul</hi> by his prayers
obteined his recovery, &amp; ſent him
back to his Church with an Epiſtle
full of wholeſome inſtructions, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the errors of <hi>Cerinthus, Simon</hi>
the Magician, and of other Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors,
whom he calls enemies of the
Croſs of Chriſt, becauſe they taught
that our Lord was not really cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified,
but ſome fantome in his
place. S. <hi>Ignatius</hi> Martyr, forty years
after, wrote unto them upon the
ſame ſubject, and ſo did likewiſe
S. <hi>Polycarpus.</hi> Tis true, there is doubt
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:170075:166"/>
made whether the Epiſtle of the
former be really his. The Apoſtle
had not preached in the city of <hi>C<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſus,</hi>
which is in the Province of
<hi>Phrygia;</hi> yet knowing the ſtate of
that Church aſſembled by <hi>Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phras,</hi>
hee wrote unto them, that
they ſhould beware of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> of
the Hereticks, and of the Gentiles,
which ſowed erroneous doctrine
amongſt them, touching Legal Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations,
and the worſhip of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
or Genienſes. <hi>Philemon</hi> after his
converſion very much aſſiſted the
faithful, making his houſe the place
of their aſſemblies, &amp; giving great
alms to the poor. One of his ſlaves,
called <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> ran away from his
houſ in quality of a thief; this ſlave
coming to <hi>Rome,</hi> fell luckily into
the hands of the Apoſtle, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
him, which obliged him
particularly to write in his behalf
to his maſter for his pardon, &amp; that
he would receive him again, not as
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:170075:167"/>
a fugitive, but as a deare childe
which hee had begotten in his
chains. <hi>Theodoret</hi> ſaies, that <hi>Philemon</hi>
ſent him back to ſerve and aſſiſt S.
<hi>Paul:</hi> and S. <hi>Hierome</hi> reports, that
he was firſt made Deacon, &amp; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Biſhop of <hi>Epheſus:</hi> S. <hi>Ignatius</hi>
ſpeakes of him in his Epiſtle to the
<hi>Epheſians,</hi> with much honour; and,
the Martyrologue keeps his memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
the ſixteenth of <hi>February,</hi> as of a
Martyr.</p>
               <p>Whileſt the Apoſtle gave theſe
glorious proofs of his great Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<hi>Nero</hi> being then in the fifth
year of his Empire, let flie the reins
to his wicked inclinations; his
mother <hi>Agrippina</hi> notwithſtanding
held him in a little, which rendred
him more attentive to thoſe who
repreſented her as an ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
woman, that would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
keep him as ward. <hi>Poppea,</hi> of
whom he was deſperately enamou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
uſed to reproach him with
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:170075:167"/>
this, more bitterly then others, and
often times called him Pupil; for
ſhe deteſted <hi>Agrippina,</hi> becauſe ſhee
oppoſed her marriage, and labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that of <hi>Octavia,</hi> ſiſter to <hi>Britani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus;</hi>
ſhe knew ſo well how to mix
teares and prayers with her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,
that in the end ſhee made
that love he owed to a mother, give
place to her adulterate love. Thoſe
who had power with the Emperor
oppoſed it not, being well pleaſed
to ſee her credit diminiſhed, who, in
their opinion, uſed it too inſolent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
not imagining it would have
come to that laſt extremity of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricide.
<hi>Agrippina</hi> on her part ſought
to regain him by all ſort of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes,
and to that end ſhe was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
to have imployed meſſengers
to commit a horrible inceſt, if <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi>
had not hindered it by the
means of <hi>Actea,</hi> one of the Miſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of this deteſtable Prince: But,
in the end, hee reſolves to take his
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:170075:168"/>
mother away, whoſe authority was
to him inſupportable, and whoſe
wit with reaſon he feared. Firſt he
tryed poiſon, then hee cauſed the
floor of her chamber to fall whileſt
ſhee was aſleep. Neither of thoſe
ſucceeding, nor that of the ſhip,
which he had cauſed to be ſo built,
as the ſides ſhould fall aſunder in
the middſt of the ſea, he uſed open
force, and made her to be ſtabbed
in her bed. This parricide begot
ſtrange frights in the minde of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi>
who did not conſider the enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of it till it was done: the flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries
of thoſe who congratulated
his delivery from the Ambuſhes of
his mother; the exagerations made
of her Inſolencies and Cruelties
during the life of <hi>Claudius,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the reigne of his Sonne; the
Thankſgiving to the Gods, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of Annual Games, and the
erecting of a Statue near to that of
<hi>Minerva;</hi> all theſe (I ſay) freed him
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:170075:168"/>
not from horrible fantomes which
night and day beſet his frighted
fancy. To blot out in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
an action ſo cruel, he would
do others of clemency; hence hee
recalled many perſons of quality,
who had been baniſhed, and ſet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
priſoners at liberty, amongſt
whom perhaps the Apoſtle might
be one. Before hee departed from
<hi>Rome,</hi> hee wrote, according to the
opinion of many Fathers, the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> to renew the
memory of thoſe verities which he
had preached to them, and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe
them not to make a dangerous
mixture of Judaiſm and Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity:
others beleeve it was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
before his arrivall at this great
City. It was likewiſe before his
departure, that he compoſed his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle
to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> whoſe ſtile &amp;
matter are ſo ſublime, that in my
opinion there need no other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to prove him to be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:170075:169"/>
'Tis true, he puts not his name
to it in the Frontiſpice, as he does
to the others, whence many believe
it was none of his: but this reaſon
is not ſufficient; for he being odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> as we have ſeen in
the courſe of this his ſtory; if hee
had put his name in the Superſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
of the Letter, it might have
diſtaſted and hindered the reading
of it. <hi>I</hi> confeſs, 'tis harder to anſwer
the difference of ſtile, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
evidently in this Epiſtle from
the others, this being more pure &amp;
leſs filled with Parentheſes. There
is in it much of S. <hi>Lukes</hi> way of
ſpeaking, both in his Goſpel and
and in the ſtory of the Acts: ſo
that it might well be, the matter of
the Epiſtle was S. <hi>Pauls,</hi> and the ſtile
S. <hi>Lukes,</hi> who was his diſciple and
companion. I willingly rank my
ſelf with thoſe of this opinion, for I
cannot approve theirs who attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
it to S. <hi>Barnaby</hi> and S. <hi>Clement,</hi>
                  <pb n="327" facs="tcp:170075:169"/>
although it be antient. Wee have
the writings of them both, at leſt
they bear their names, and there is
no conformity to be found, neither
in the matter or language, with
that Epiſtle whereof we ſpeak. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
to ſpeak of Sacrifices and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitical
Prieſt-hood ſo profoundly
as that Author does, me thinks it
cannot be but S. <hi>Pauls,</hi> who had
learnt thoſe things at the feet of
<hi>Gamaliel,</hi> and confeſſes himſelf that
he underſtood them more perfectly
then any of his companions. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
hee was not properly the
Apoſtle of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> yet he loved
them as thoſe who were of one
nation and origine with him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
he hath ſhewed, in all the courſe of
his life, that he had alwaies a great
tenderneſs for them, and a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
care of their ſalvation: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
'tis very probable, that hee
would inſtruct them by writing, as
well as by word of mouth, &amp; that
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:170075:170"/>
many being ſpread abroad in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
where they uſed the Greek
tongue, he made the Verities, which
he taught S. <hi>Luke,</hi> to be written in
that dialect. They are wonderfull
high, and thoſe who underſtand
them well, may boaſt that they
know Jeſus Chriſt, and the ſtate of
the Goſpel, which is no other thing
then the accompliſhment of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Law, not onely in figures, all
which related to the Son of God,
but alſo in the deliverance of men
from the yoke of ſin, and in their
ſanctification which the Law could
not do. But this diſcourſe would
draw us too farre, and paſs the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
of the hiſtorical life of S. <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We can ſay no more of that which
hee did till his death, unleſs wee
would follow relations which are
apocryphal. 'Tis not known, when
he went out of <hi>Rome,</hi> whether or no
he went into <hi>Spain,</hi> S. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> S.
<hi>Hierome,</hi> and many other Fathers
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:170075:170"/>
affirm it. The more moderne wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
add, that hee paſſed amidſt the
<hi>Gaules,</hi> and eſtabliſhed the Procon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul
<hi>Sergius Paulus</hi> (of whom wee
have ſpoken) Biſhop of <hi>Narbone;</hi> he
ſhewes in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi>
that hee had a deſigne to carry the
Goſpel into <hi>Spain,</hi> and this deſire
was very conformable to the ſpirit
of his Apoſtleſhip, which compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
all Nations of the world.
Being now free, nothing could hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him from this enterpriſe, by
which he might enlighten a people
plunged in Idolatry; for having
laboured ſufficiently in the Eaſt, he
would next ſteer his courſe to the
Weſt; and, indeed, ſo great a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt
might well require ſuch a
work-man: what hee acted there,
lies hid to our knowledge, by a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
ſtroke of Providence; and, if
wee may judge by that which hee
hath already done, wee cannot
doubt, but that he gained a great
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:170075:171"/>
number of ſervants to his Maſter,
and that the devil loſt as much of
his authority there, as he had done
in other places where his Temples
were overthrown. In this unknown
voyage he ſpent eight yeares; du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
which time, the Church loſt
many of her Maſters and Children,
or rather ſent them to heaven by a
glorious martyrdom.</p>
               <p>The death of S. <hi>James,</hi> who was
called the brother of our Lord (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the teſtimony of <hi>Jeſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi>
himſelfe) drew upon the city
of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> the horrid calamities
of that famous ſiege, which ruined
it intirely. Hee had governed that
Church, twenty nine yeares, with
ſo great a reputation of ſanctity,
that the people, when hee walked
in the ſtreets, thought themſelves
very happy if they could but touch
the hemm of his garment. <hi>Euſebius,</hi>
and, before him, <hi>Hegeſippus,</hi> ſayes;
<hi>that he was ſanctified in his mothers
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:170075:171"/>
womb, that he ever abſtained from all
ſort of liquours which might cauſe
drunkenneſs, and from fleſh; that a
raſor never toucht his head; that hee
was never in the bathes, and that by
his long continuance in prayer, there
was a ſcale, like to the skin of a Camel,
grown over his knees.</hi> The Scribes &amp;
Phariſees, alwaies the ſame, could
not ſupport the credit &amp; reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this man who converted ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
by his example, as well as
words. Wherefore, in a great aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly
of the people, they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to perſwade him publickly
to profeſs Judaiſm; which hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing,
was forthwith precipitated
from the top of the Temple, where,
at the foot, a dyer with a Lever
killed him out-right. We have a
Canonical Epiſtle of his, in which
hee labours principally to prove
the neceſſity of good works, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
the error of <hi>Simon</hi> the Magici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:170075:172"/>
who ſaid faith alone was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to ſalvation.</p>
               <p>After him, <hi>Simon</hi> the ſon of <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophas,</hi>
alſo called the brother of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, becauſe he was his cozen,
was choſen Biſhop of <hi>Hieruſalem.</hi>
S. <hi>Barnaby,</hi> the faithfull companion
of the Apoſtle in his peregrinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
at the ſame time time received
alſo the crown of martyrdom in
the Iſle of <hi>Cyprus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the other ſide, <hi>Mark</hi> the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and one of the Ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angeliſts,
after he had governed the
Church of <hi>Alexandria</hi> with great
ſanctity, was taken on a Sunday by
the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who put a rope about
his neck, and ſo dragged him for
two dayes together about the
ſtreets, and in rough and uneven
places, where, in the end, he finiſhed
his life.</p>
               <p>The Chriſtians that were under
his conduct led a marvelous holy
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:170075:172"/>
life. <hi>Philo</hi> the Jew compoſed a
book expreſly in their praiſe, called
<hi>The Contemplative Life,</hi> wherein hee
gives them the name of <hi>Eſſens,</hi>
taking them for <hi>Jewes,</hi> becauſe in
that time they retained many le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Ceremonies. I know there are
great diſputes among learned men,
upon this paſſage: but ſince I write
not for them, it were to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to go about to cleare tha diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
more curious then profitable,
wee ſhall doe better to return to
<hi>Rome,</hi> where the Church was agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with a horrible perſecution.
<hi>Nero,</hi> in the tenth of his Empire, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing
in wickedneſs, as he grew
up in years, gave fire himſelf to the
Citie of <hi>Rome.</hi> The ſtreets were too
narrow for him, and he had a mind
to rebuild it, that it might bear his
name. The fire began in that part
of the <hi>Cirque</hi> which joyned to the
<hi>Mounts Palatine,</hi> and <hi>Caelius;</hi> and,
from thence, meeting with Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:170075:173"/>
filled with combuſtible mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and being carried with the
winde which began to riſe, it
ſpread it ſelfe with ſuch violence,
that remedies were too late to reſiſt
its fury. The air ecchoed with the
lamentable cryes of Women and
children, who, in that apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of fear, knew not whither to go
for ſafety, and hindered thoſe that
would have helpt them: for
whileſt ſome, either expected, or
would ſecure others, they ſo trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
one another, that they found
themſelves encompaſſed with
flames. In the narrow ſtreets, where
there were many turnings, the
throng was ſo great, there was no
paſſing. When men were gotten ſo
far, as they thought the fire could
not reach them, then they were
ſuddenly ſurpriſed by it, as it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
rather to flie then to creep a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long.
Many, to ſave their wives,
periſht themſelves; and others
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:170075:173"/>
would not out-live them, although
they might eaſily have been ſaved.
Fathers loſt their lives ſtaying by
their children; in fine, never was
ſeen ſo horrible a ſpectacle; ſuch
as would have brought water, or
pulled down houſes before the fire,
were hindered with Officers, who,
at the corners of ſtreets throwing
about fiery balls, cryed out, that
what they did was by order, mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
by the command of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour;
who, as is commonly repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
during this ſad calamity, was
ſinging on the ſtage the Burning of
<hi>Troy.</hi> Notwithſtanding, he ſought to
ſuppreſs this opinion, cauſing many
hutts to be built in his gardens for
thoſe who had loſt their houſes by
the fire. Of fourteen quarters which
compoſed the city, there were but
four left intire. The houſes of three
of them, were intirely levelled with
the ground, and, in the other ſeven,
there remained onely the tops of
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:170075:174"/>
buildings half burnt and ruined.
Thus all the riches, heaped toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſince the foundation of the
Common-wealth, of ſo many Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
ſo many Pictures and other
other rarities, tranſported from all
the Nations of the world, of ſo
many Temples built with ſuch
magnificence, and by the Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the people rendered ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
and renowned, there remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
onely a little heap of Aſhes: a
ſad example of the vanity of all
humane things.</p>
               <p>But, to ſee that great City all in
flames, was not ſo dreadfull, as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
to behold a great number
of Chriſtians tormented by <hi>Nero,</hi> as
authors of the fire, without diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
either of age or quality; and,
adding deriſion to his cruelty, hee
commanded ſome to be covered
with the skins of wilde beaſts, to the
end they might be worried to death
by fierce dogs. Others, he nailed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:170075:174"/>
Croſſes, and cauſed their bodies
to be rubbed over with pitch, and
other things apt to take fire, that, in
the night time, they ſerved for tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
to light thoſe who paſſed by,
whileſt they conſumed like living
holocauſts, for the defence of the
name of J. Chriſt. His gardens were
the theatre of this abominable
execution. Although the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
were odious to the <hi>Romanes,</hi>
who diſtinguiſhed them not from
the Jewes &amp; Hereticks of that time,
whoſe abominations indeed by
right deſerved their publick hatred,
yet they had compaſſion of theſe;
for every one ſaw they periſhed not
for their own crimes, but to ſatisfie
the unſatiable cruelty of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,
who would juſtifie himſelf at
their coſts. This was the firſt perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
in which God would try his
Church amongſt the Gentiles. It
was a while interrupted by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy
diſcovered againſt this Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:170075:175"/>
in which <hi>Seneca</hi> being accuſed
to have a hand, was forced to make
ſatisfaction with his life let out by
his veins; a greater reſolution
could not be deſired, then what he
ſhewed in his death, but, me thinks,
'tis yet to be deplored, ſince this
conſtancy was only Philoſophical,
not Chriſtian. <hi>Plautus Lateranus</hi>
(whoſe Palace was afterwards
changed into a Church, which yet
bears the name of <hi>Lateran)</hi> &amp; many
other perſons of quality, periſhed
for the ſame cauſe. <hi>Poppea</hi> followed
not long after; for <hi>Nero</hi> loving her
like a Tyrant, ſlew her in a fury
with a ſpurn of his foot. To theſe
Maſſacres, he added afterwards the
unjuſt deaths of many Senators,
<hi>Thraſius Paetus,</hi> and <hi>Bare<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s Soranus.</hi>
But, that of S. <hi>Paul</hi> was the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his ſacrileges, and, it is now
time, after eight years abſence, that
we return again with him to <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was impriſoned not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:170075:175"/>
his arrival. If we will believe S.
<hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> the converſion of the
Emperours Miſtreſs was the cauſe.
It is likely alſo, the death of <hi>Simon</hi>
the Magician contributed towards
it. This impoſtor had promiſed
<hi>Nero</hi> to fly in his ſight up to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
and, on the day appointed for
this famous enterpriſe, he was ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
in the aire by the devils, all
the people beholding him. But, at
the prayers of S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
(for S. <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> joynes
them both in this action) hee was
precipitated in an inſtant to the
earth, where hee long ſurvived not
this ſhamefull fall. Hereupon, the
Emperour, who loved him would
revenge his death upon thoſe whom
he believed to be the authors. S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
after he had lain nine moneths
in priſon, was condemned to be
crucified, and S. <hi>Paul</hi> to have his
head ſtruck off, as being a Citizen
of <hi>Rome.</hi> Before the execution, they
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:170075:176"/>
were both whipped with rods, for
the crime of impiety whereof they
were accuſed; which ſuppoſed
crime, rendred S. <hi>Paul</hi> uncapable of
the priviledge of a free Deniſon. In
the Church of S. <hi>Mary,</hi> beyond the
bridge over <hi>Tyber,</hi> are yet to be ſeen
the Pillars, whereunto ('tis ſaid)
they were faſtned. The Prince of
the Apoſtles would dye with his
head downwards, to make, in that
ſhamefull death, a diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Maſter and the Servant.
S. <hi>Paul,</hi> on the way to his executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
converted three Souldiers, who
conducted him. During his impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment,
he, and his noble Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
converted forty ſeven of their
guard, beſides <hi>Proceſſas</hi> and <hi>Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>
their Goalers; for whoſe ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme,
God miraculouſly made a
fountain to iſſue forth in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
The Apoſtle prayed for his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioner,
&amp; offered his head with
more joy, then if had been to receive
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:170075:176"/>
a Diademe: three times the head
gave a leap, and, at every bound,
produced a fountain. A Tradition,
approved by many antient Fathers
of the Church, adds, that milk in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of blood ranne out of his
wound, which cauſed no leſs aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
to the Gentiles, then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation
to the Faithfull.</p>
               <p>I know, it is very hard to marke
out the preciſe time of Martyrdom,
both of the one and other; but, it is
certain, they ſuffered with a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
ſutable to the tranſcendency
of their Apoſtleſhip; and, it is the
opinion of the Church, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been ſo ſtrictly linked toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in their lives, God would
have them likewiſe ſo in their
deaths, by ſuffering for one and the
ſame cauſe, on the ſame day, and in
the Capitall City of the world,
where they had aſſaulted Idolatry
even in the throne, &amp;, preaching the
Goſpel, laid the foundation of an
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:170075:177"/>
Empire, againſt which, hell it ſelfe
ſhall never be able to prevail.</p>
               <p>Thus S. <hi>Paul</hi> ended his life in the
ſixty eighth year of his age, and the
thirty fifth of his Converſion. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
had not beſtowed upon him a
preſence to his advantage, as hee
himſelfe confeſſes; but ſhee recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced
it in a vaſt wit, and, a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
which even dangers fortified.
To the ſcience of humane Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
acquired at <hi>Tharſus,</hi> he added a
perfect knowledge of the Law of
<hi>Moyſes,</hi> which he learnt at the feet
of <hi>Gamaliel</hi> a moſt eminent Doctor,
both for his doctrine and piety.
His zeal for this Law, tranſported
him into thoſe extremities of fury,
which became the ſubject of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
in the whole ſequel of his
life. Hee thought to be a faithfull
diſciple to <hi>Moyſes,</hi> He muſt needs be
an irreconciliable enemy to Jeſus
Chriſt, and unto all thoſe who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
in him. The name alone of
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:170075:177"/>
being his diſciple, ſeemed to him a
juſt ground for his hatred; hee
thought he could not better teſtifie
a zeal for his religion, then by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting
all obligati<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ns of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
and ſtifling in his heart all
ſenſe &amp; feeling of nature: though
S. <hi>Stephen</hi> was his near kinſman, yet
nevertheleſs he was an aſſiſtant and
complice in his death. His rage was
was not content with this ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
eſteeming it an honour to be
employed as executioner in the
cruel commands of the Prieſts, and
gloried much, when, either by
force or cunning, he had drawn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
one to deny the Faith of Jeſus
Chriſt. The fury of his blinde and
impoiſoned zeal could not be kept
within the limits of <hi>Hieruſalem.</hi>
He would alſo make it remarkable
in the City of <hi>Damaſco;</hi> to this
end, hee obtained expreſs orders,
that he might ſeize on all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and bring them priſoners to
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:170075:178"/>
the Capital City of <hi>Judea,</hi> to make
their deaths more ignominious, by
making it more publick. But, in
his moſt violent exceſs of hatred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Saviour of the world, he
found the effects of his extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
goodneſs. For a light more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diant
then the Sun, although it was
at mid day, dazled his eies, and a
divine illuſtration cleared his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.
J. Chriſt reproved him
for his perſecution, and the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
preſently acknowledged him for
his Maſter. The grace of J. C. ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted
in this change, its moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
effects, &amp; ſhews men, who
flatter themſelves with an opinion
of their own merits, that it is not
conferred upon them, becauſe they
are Saints, but rather to make
them Saints. It appears, there needs
not time to ſoften the moſt rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
hearts, and that the moſt obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
muſt yeeld to the amorous vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence
of its impulſes, by a happy
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:170075:178"/>
liberty, which places them in the
holy and pleaſant ſervitude of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.
<hi>Pelagius,</hi> a long time after, leſt
hee ſhould make a ſlave of mans
will, made it a divinity, but his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
was ſufficiently condemned by
this Converſion. Sinners may here
learn to hope for the effect of ſome
mercy, which purifies, when it
pleaſes, the greateſt ſtains, &amp; molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
the moſt obdurate hearts. Never
any one has better known both the
old &amp; new man, in which conſiſts
all Chriſtian religion, then S. <hi>Paul:</hi>
He has taught the world what miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
the firſt hath brought upon it, &amp;
the unhappy effects of his poiſon
on thoſe who deſcended from him:
Hee hath ſhewed the proud man,
who flatters himſelf in his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency,
that he was the ſon of an
offender, the ſlave of ſin, &amp; the heir
of death: He has repreſented to him
all his deformities, diſcovered all
his ulcers, &amp; convinced him in this,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:170075:179"/>
that he is frail and miſerable: He
has made the wiſeſt amongſt the
Gentiles, to obſerve, that their wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
was indeed true folly; that
they were loſt in their imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and that their vertues had but a
falſe appearance of goodneſs: Hee
ſo drew to the life the corruption
of manners, which attends Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
as a juſt puniſhment of its blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
that thoſe who were not
wholly ſtupified and obdurate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
at leſt aſhamed, if not repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant.
By his ſtudy and diligence,
he learnt the letter of the Law, at
the feet of <hi>Gamaliel;</hi> by the light
of Grace he knew the inſufficiency
of it, to mans juſtification; he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
it not to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> that hee
might beat down their pride, and
teach them, they were to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt,
if they meant to be delivered from
the yoke of ſin and concupiſcence.
Theſe verities, which they ought to
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:170075:179"/>
have reſpected, put them into a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and publication of irreconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
enmity againſt him. In what
place ſoever he went, he found them
prepared to croſs his deſignes, and
raiſe perſecutions againſt him: they
laid ambuſhes for him both by
land and ſea, where horrid tempeſts
ſeemed to him leſs terrible then
their hatred. To ruine him, they
made uſe of the authority of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veruours,
and imployed their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
with Princes; they abuſed the
ſimplicity of pious women, to chaſe
him out of Cities where he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with ſucceſs. In <hi>Lyſtris,</hi> they
made thoſe throw ſtones at him,
who, but two hours before, would
have adored him for a God. Hee
bare the marks of their cruelty up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his back, in the many ſtripes hee
received; and, had hee laid open to
us all the other afflictions, which he
ſuffered by their perſecution, wee
might behold the moſt admirable
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:170075:180"/>
example of a perfect patience, that
ever has been, and the moſt horrid
fury whereof men are capable. In
theſe few things which he relates of
himſelf, we may behold his mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
and courage both tegether. He
was wearied with no pains, and hee
compared not himſelf with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Miniſters of the Goſpel, but
in his great ſufferings for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of it. He was oftner impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned
then any other, and turned
over to executioners, who loaded
him with ſtripes. He often ſuffered
ſhipwrack at ſea, and ran dangers in
the calmeſt rivers. In Cities, the
people defamed him with calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
and treated him rudely in his
perſon; nor was hee ſecure in ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.
His patience was tryed both
in hunger and thirſt, and he was ſo
far from yielding any pleaſures to
his ſenſes, that hee wanted neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
for the ſuſtaining of his life. He
felt the violence of cold in his voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages,
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:170075:180"/>
nor could the ice abate the
heat of his zeal. He had not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to defend himſelf from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
of the weather, and the pooreſt
perſons would have been aſhamed
to wear his garments. Hee was an
invincible Champion, that fought
naked againſt his naked enemies
the devils. But whatſoever injuries
he ſuffered by the <hi>Jews</hi> &amp; Gentiles,
thoſe hee endured from falſe bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
were more dangerous, and
more inſupportable. The profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which they made of the Goſpel
in outward ſhew, covered their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
ambition, and covetouſneſs,
and being not the leaſt ſuſpected of
any ill deſigne, were, by that, the
more able to doe him harm. His
great reputation made his greateſt
crimes: they could not endure his
ſublime doctrine, which had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of terreſtrial in it, nor the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
of his zeal, which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to knowledge, nor the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:170075:181"/>
of his courage, which would
not bow in any thing that concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the glory of God, nor his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſſed
charity, that ſought no
advantages to himſelf. There were
no calumnies ſo black which they
caſt not upon him, or diſperſed not
cunningly amongſt thoſe, who
knew not the ground of their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
&amp; the motives of their hatred.
To hear them ſpeak, they ſeemed
to be no waies intereſſed, but in the
defence of truth, and regarded only
the ſalvation of ſouls. But they ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
their paſſion, and many times
thoſe were the inſtruments of their
vengeance, who ought to have been
the Judges.</p>
               <p>But their fury found it ſelf decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in all deſignes, &amp; hurt none but
thoſe who had ſo unjuſtly entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and ſo cruelly nouriſhed it.
The Myſtery of iniquity was diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered;
and every one ſaw that the
falſe Apoſtles, who perſecuted him
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:170075:181"/>
with ſo much obſtinacy and fury,
were true Wolves in Sheep-skins,
and that they hated him as offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
hate their Judges. All their
injuries could not move him to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
bitterneſſe, he always rendering
bleſſings for the maledictions they
charged upon him. He remembred
that he was Apoſtle to him, who
bore the name of Impoſtor, Sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,
and Samaritan. All things
ſeemed ſweet to him, if tending to
the progreſſe of the Goſpel, and all
his care was, that it might have no
obſtacle. Although in his rapture
he had ſeen the moſt profound my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries
of God, yet he accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
himſelf to the weakneſs of his
diſciples, and ſtammered it out with
them. His Charity comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all the world, and his care was
extended unto Slaves as well as
Princes. His preaching was plain,
and he corrupted not the words of
Jeſus Chriſt, by the ornaments of
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:170075:182"/>
humane learning. His reaſons
were ſo forcible, that the moſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
if not perſwaded by them, were
at leſt confounded. His Epiſtles
are Abyſſes of Divine knowledge;
one may ſee the light of his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
there to ſparkle, and in
every line, the fire of his Charity.
The proud are there dazeled, and
the humble may finde wholſom in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions.
The Flower of human
Eloquence are not ſeen there, but
all the beauties of Heavenly rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick
ſhine in them. This ſtile is
not always elegant, but the art in
diſcuſſing matters, and managing
the Spirits of men, is there admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Prudence appears in all his
precepts, and all the profane Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques
come not near them. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
morality is found there in its
purity, and every one may there
learn the duty of his condition,
without diſguiſe, without ſubtilty,
and without thoſe pernicious imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:170075:182"/>
which have corrupted the
good manners of theſe latter ages.
He neither ſought his own reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
nor the applauſe of men, and
one of his chief maxims was, that
we could not pleaſe them, and be
ſervants of Jeſus Chriſt. He regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
not men, but as they bore the
image of his Maſter, and all his
cares were but to imprint that in
their ſouls. He having received
the Evangelical verity, as a ſacred
pledge, he would never alter it,
out of any complacence. He ſtoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
to the capacity of his Diſciples,
but he made not their capacity the
rule of his Doctrine, as if he were
onely to tell them what they could
comprehend. In ſtead of ſatisfying
humane reaſon, which is very fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cund,
and inſolent in her doubts, he
placed it under the yoak of faith,
remitting it to the ſecrets of Gods
Divine judgements. The beloved
Diſciple repoſed upon the boſome
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:170075:183"/>
of Jeſus Chriſt, but we may ſay that
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> entred into it, and ſaw
the operations of his Divine life,
and the influences diffuſed from
thence upon his members. Never
any one better knew the Oeconomy
of the myſtical body, and her cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence
with the head. Never
was the ardor of zeal ſo admirably
mixt with prudence, for the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
and ſanctifying of this body:
proper intereſt was unknown to
him. He was ſo far from making
any ſordid commerce of the Goſpel,
as he would not accept of neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
for his life. His charity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the faithful governed his
power, and he had rather diminiſh
his authority, then give the leaſt
cauſe of murmur. His poverty was
the more Evangelical, in that it was
deſpiſed. He was not aſhamed to
take pains for his living, with the
ſame hands that wrought miracles,
and write inſtructions to all the
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:170075:183"/>
Church. He complied with all men
by an admirable condeſcenſion, and
never had Father more tenderneſs
for his Children, then he for his
diſciples. The Phariſees, the Scribes,
the Prieſts, were not able to ſpeak
before him. <hi>Athens</hi> was aſtoniſhed
to hear him, the <hi>Are page</hi> admired
him, and there he made conqueſt of
the moſt renouned of their Judges.
At <hi>Rome</hi> he ſet upon Idolatry in
the Throne, and of a Miſtreſs of
error, he made her a Miſtreſs of truth
over all the earth. He, who firſt
founded it, ſoyled it preſently with
the blood of his brother, and the
Apoſtle conſecrated it with his
blood, to eſtabliſh there the Empire
of Jeſus Chriſt. Her authority is
more extended by a religion of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
which he taught, then for
many ages ſhe could bring to paſs
by force of armes. He advanced his
conqueſts even to the Palace of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi>
making the domeſticks of a moſt
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:170075:184"/>
cruel and infamous Tyrant, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the ſervants of Jeſus Chriſt.
Once he eſcaped the Jawes of this
Lyon, becauſe God had ſhut them
up, that he might make known his
name to all the earth. But when the
time of his Coronation was come,
he looſened the reins to this mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
who ſacrificed him to his cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty,
and what could be expected
leſs from him, who had not ſpared
his own Mother? The condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Judge was a proof of the
Criminals vertue. After his death,
the Church hears him as her Maſter,
and the Schools of Chriſtians re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
all his words as infallible O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.
He is one of the eyes of the
body, whereof Jeſus Chriſt is the
head. He is the ſhrill Trumpet of
the Goſpel, which is heard over all
the earth. He is the Apoſtle of the
Son of God, not mortal and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
but glorious and living the
life of reſurrection. He is the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:170075:184"/>
triumph of his grace, the
ſubject of his mercies, the veſſel of
a ſingular election, the inſtrument
of his greateſt wonders, the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter
of his wil, and the treaſurer
of all his ſecrets. The Miniſter of
his greateſt favours, the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
of his moſt holy aliance, the
Oracle of his higheſt verities. From
this fountain the holy Fathers have
drawn what they have moſt admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.
Tis from this Mine they have
fetched all their riches. Tis from
his ſpoyles they have taken all their
noble ornaments. They never went
aſtray when they took him for their
guide. They have always triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
when they uſed his armes. It is
his fire that warmed their zeal, as
his light enlightned them. It is with
his Thunder-bolts they have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown
the inſolency of Hereſie, and
the rebellion of Schiſme. It is by
his rules they have formed their
morality. It is by his counſels they
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:170075:185"/>
have governed the Church. It is by
his maximes they have cleared the
doubts of the faithful, ſatisfied their
ſcruples, and diſcovered the ſnares
which were ſet to entrap them.</p>
               <p>We have endeavoured in this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
to repreſent the marvelous
actions of his life, and though we
are neither able, nor willing to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
to the glory of Eloquence, yet
we may promiſe this to our ſelves,
that all unpartial Readers will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
we have herein been very faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and diſintereſſed.</p>
