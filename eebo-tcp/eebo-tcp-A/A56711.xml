            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:34693:4"/>
I can not tell what acceptance it may relish with you, in respect of your olde age; yet ſure I am, were you trauelling vnto Hieruſalem, and should be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by him or me, though inferiour in years, of the great dangers aſſuredly you would fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, if you held on in the new way you had commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced your iourney in, doubtleſſe you would take it maruelous kindly of vs, and as an argument of our true reſpectfull loue towards you, that by our notice you were prevented from falling in to the hands of bloodſucking enimies, or being ſwalowed vp in ſome vnknowne gulfe in your new paſſage. This is now you caſe: you are traueling in your Reſolution to the beauenly Hieruſalem: but vnder fauour and without offence, giue me leaue to tell you, that if you proceede in this new way, and new Religion you are in, the perills are unſpeakably great, for that all going and holding this new way ar robbed: not of their temporall wealth, nor of their temporall life depriued by drowning, but by à Diabolicall crew and an Infernall gulfe spoiled of their ſowles, to their owne irrepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble dammage, and the opprobrious diſgrace of Chriſt most pretious blood ſpilt in vaine for them. And howbeit this new way you walke in, may perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenture ſeeme to you to be right and ſecure; Yet vndoutedly except you turne out of it, in the end it will leade you to endleſſe perdition. You can not be

               <hi>Hac animaduerſione percutitur pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, vt moriens obliuiſcatur ſui, qui dum viue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret oblitus eſt Dei.</hi> Aske then I beſeech you timely of the old paths: which is the Good way, and walke in it, and you shall finde refreshing for your ſoule, Theſe old paths, which is the Good way in which all the godly and holy perſons wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to the heauenly Hieruſalem, is the infallible iudgment of the ſupreame Paſtours and Gouenours of Gods Church, which they followed as the guide of faith and neceſſary way of Salvation. In the old law it was strictly commaunded by almighty God. Exod <hi>17.</hi> inſomuch as whoſoeuer should be ſo proud, as that he would not obey the order and commaund of the Cheife Priest, who was the iudge in Eccleſiasticall affaires, he was to die: This alſo in the beginning and foundation of the new law our B. Sauiour ſo ſtrictly commaunded as he that would not obediently harken to the Church, he was to be reputed (not as one capable of life euerlasting) but as à beathen and publicane, that is, à perſon out of the ſtate of ſaluation. This was the way S. Austen (whom euen the Proteſtants affirme to haue beene à moſt excellent wittnes of Antiquity, as liuing about the Primitiue times of Chriſts Church) tooke to reſolue himſelfe infallibly in doubts of Religion, as is to be ſeene in diuers places of his diuine workes; finally this
<pb facs="tcp:34693:7"/>
alſo is the finall and continuall way in all ages ſince, all Orthodoxe profeſsours haue folowed in the determination of controuerſies of faith, as is manifeſt by the peruſall of the Eccleſiaſticall Records. This way did my deceaſed Brother take to reſolue himſelfe, employing all his cares to finde out the true Church of Chriſt, that is the Catholique Church: which the Apostles, in their Creed, only teach vs to belieue at all times, it being true at all times, to ſay, <hi>I beleeue in the holy Ghoſt, the holy Catholique Church:</hi> and to rest himſefe touching all points of faith in her iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, she being infallible therin, as perpetually being taught by the holy Ghoſt all truth and no errour. He ſought humbly with perſeuerance, and through Gods mercifull goodnes found it out'ſeeke alſo and you shall finde. Shall you vouchſafe to peruſe impartially this his Manifest I am confident it will contribute much direction to the knowledge and embracement therof, to the glory of God, the ioy of the Angells and heauenly Saints, the ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of your ſoule and comfort of your beſt friends, among whom he is one, who will not ceaſe to pray our Bleſſed Lord and Sauiour, that he will illuminate the darknes of yours, my other friends, and Countrymens ſoules, that he will giue you à true faith, an aſſured hope, à perfect Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and endue you with the knowledge of him:
<pb facs="tcp:34693:7"/>
that vnited to the Catholique Church, in all things all manner of wayes, you may accomplish his holy pleaſure in this life, and in the next, enioying him with all the Saints, you may ſing his mercies for euer. Which is, and shall be the dayly praier of him, who humbly begging that the neceſſary diſcharge of his bounden duty ſor your ſoules Good, may finde pardon for his freedome, remaines euer as he profeſſeth and ſubſcribeth.</p>

            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>EINGE not ignorant, but very ſenſible how falſely my brother is voyced to haue ſeduced me (ſuch is theire phraſe they pleaſe to vſe) to become Catholique; and againe how temerariouſly, noe leſſe vniuſtly my ſelfe is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of Levitie and inconſtancy for aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doninge the Proteſtant reformed Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: I haue therfore thought it à very beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uefull part to declare my ſelfe breifly by this enſueinge manifeſt, as well to clere my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as to render your ſelfe, an dmy other beſt freinds ſome ſatisfactory accoumpt in iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of myne owne Action.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:34693:11"/>
Firſt then, although my brother doe much ioy with the Angells for my Converſion (as I doubt not but all godly people doe) and might much more haue gloryed, had he been the Inſtrument or Agent therof; yet vpon my reſolution, I aſſure yow, he was ſoe great à ſtranger unto it, as that he knew me not to be otherwiſe then à Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, before that ſome weeks aſter my reconſiliation to the Church of Chriſt, I tould him I was à Catholique.</p>
            <p>Yea ſoe farr was he from conceavinge any hopes that way, as that he ingeniouſly and playnly tould me: that I was one of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneſt Spiritts that ever he heard ſpeake againſt his Religion.</p>
            <p>How then was he an Actor in my Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the Catholique Church, that was not onely ſuch à ſtranger to it, but allſo in à man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner diſpayringe therof.</p>
            <p>As Concerninge the obiected Levity: I ſincerly proteſt it was the due Conſideration of the vanityes of theſe tranſitory affayrs, the vncertaynty of this preſent life, the Innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable daingers that therin occurre, the Dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Iudgement that I was to vndergoe, and the fynall ſentence of eternall Ioye, or miſery, never dyeing but everlaſtinge, wich I was to receive:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:34693:11"/>
Theſe important poynts (I ſay) ſeriouſly pondered, and not levity, occaſioned my ſearch into matters of Religion, on the verity or falſety wherof accordingly depends the ſalvation or damnation of every mans ſoule: which is the <hi>Vnum neceſſarium,</hi> (to vſe the Goſpell phraſe) that aboue all affaires is to be regarded, What exchange will à man make for his ſoule? Verily by the irrefragable teſtimony of our Sauiour, If he gaynes the whole world he profitts nothinge if he ſuffer damage therof; <hi>Vnderſtand yee theſe things that forgett God, whilſt peradve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture ther will not be any to redeeme yow.</hi> Pſ. 49. Oh all yee who are enthraled by the loue of periſſinge riches, temporall honnors, Carnall freinds, and wordly reſpects; who by their actions and deeds deny God, nothinge fearinge the fynall ſentence of eternall woe, or wellfare! Oh all yee (I ſay) tymely conſider and take to hart this moſt Conſequent affaire; leaſt hereafter when it will be too late, ther wilbe none to releive or ſuccor you; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore lett vs while wee haue tyme, worke good for our ſoules: Let vs now (I ſay) while it is <hi>A nunc acceptabile,</hi> ſeeke our Lorde while he may be fownd, and be prepared to aſcertayne our ſelues in the knowledge and embracement of the one Catholique Church,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:34693:12"/>
out of which ther is noe ſalvation; leaſt when wee little thinke of it, the Sonne of man will come to call vs to à dreadfull accoumpt, and finde vs <hi>Et minus habentes, &amp; ad recte creden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum tardos:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And foraſmuch as that in the Inqueſt after ſoe weightye an argument, ther can be noe worſe preparatiue diſpoſition, and more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantagious to the findinge out of the ſoule ſavinge truth, then to haue aforehand an over wayueringe conceipt of the one ſyde, and to be prepoſſeſt by preiudicate opinion of the other part, I was reſolued vtterly to diveſt my ſelfe of the paſſions of loue or hatred towards eyther ſyde; and dilligently with the impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall eye of Charity, to looke into the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipales of both Catholique and Proteſtant Religion, And ſeeinge fayth is à fupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall guifte deſcendinge from the Father of Light, and the goodnes of the Allmighty of his parte is ſuch, that he would haue all ſaved, and forſaketh none that Cordially, humbly, and perſeverantly ſeeke him; It was daylye my earneſt and humble petition to him, ſoe to illumenate me, that if I were in the right, I might be Confirmed therin, If not to ſtate me in that Church which is the pillar and foundation of truth: aſſureing my ſelfe that

            <p>For eyther ſuch à one followeth his whole Churches authority and doctrine, or he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents from it?

not ſoe much as one expreſſe text to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe but givinge ſlipp to the demaund in queſtion, they fly to bye difficultyes, fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, or impertinent narrations, relatinge many tales of Cockes and Bulles, of this Pope and that Pope, of this Biſſopp or that Fryer, Soe deſtitute are they of the ayde of holy writt which vaynely and frequently they pretend, ſoe that the ſayeinge of the holy Prophet is well verifyed in them, <hi>The vngodly haue tould me their fables, but not as thy Lawe,</hi> Pſ. 118. But wheter haue theſe frivolous impertinences of Proteſtants wrested my diſcourſe? To retor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne then to the Byble, on which ſolye they pretend to build all their fayth, although it be not controuerted betuene Catholiques and Proteſtants, or any other nomynated Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians: whether God hath any worde written which is infallable, vſually called the holy Scripture? As it is one thinge to queſtion, whether ther be à Kinge of Spayne, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing wether Phillip, or Ferdinando be the Kinge therof? For that though the firſt (to witt) that ther is à Kinge of Spayne be moſt Certayne; yet the latter may be deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which is the Lawfull true Kinge (vzt) Ferdinando, or Phillip; Soe though it be moſt Certayne that there is à written worde
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:34693:16"/>
of God infallable: yet iuſtly may it be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned whether that booke which Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants haue and call the Byble be the holy Scripture or noe: For (as the Learned doe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue) in the Scriptures three thinges are to be conſydered, Firſt the Cannon or Catologue of divyne bookes; Secondly the tranſlation; And thirdly the ſence which is the ſoule of the Letter:</p>
            <p>Now then I demaund of Proteſtants what Infallible aſſurance they haue that the bookes which be in their Cannon, be onely divyne? And thoſe which they reiect (as Apocripha) be really ſuch: Will yow ſaye with Luther, and with other Proteſtants as Whitakre, and Doue, that yow received them from the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholique Church; Then it followeth if her authoritye who yow Credit therin be infallible, yow are allſoe bound to ſtande to her worde in other poynts of Religion: For if she be infallible (as she muſt) if yow haue any infallible aſſurance that the Scriptures yow received from her be really divyne in à matter ſoe fundamentell, much more is she to be Credited in other poynts, as namely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerninge the true interpretation therof &amp;c. Secondly out of this anſwer it followeth, that the Roman Church cannot be Antichriſtian
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:34693:16"/>
(as ſome Proteſtants vaynly pretend) For it cannot ſtand that they should preſerue the Scriptures for ſoe many ages, wherin yow pretend your Church was vnknowne and latent: For then may Iſraell be fownd in Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilon, and participation bebetwene Chriſt and Belial: And she who is falſehood it ſelfe, be, by your owne inference, the pillar and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of truth; To be shorte then, muſt the whore of the Apochalips (Thus is Antichriſt become Chriſt Servante and beſt ſupporter) Keep ſafe thoſe Recordes wherby thoſe many hundred Thowſonds of Chriſt virgins make their Clayme to the ineſtimable reward al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loted for their vowe of Chaſtitye: As eaſily wee may beleiue, that the Arke, and the Idoll Dagon may be placed together. But indeed though yow haue the Roman Churches war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that thoſe bookes that yow admitt as Canonicall to be divyne: yet never did the Roman Church warrant or aſſure yow that onely thoſe bookes placed in your Cannon, be divyne, and the reſt which yow reiect, to be Apochripha: It reſteth then that the greateſt aſſurance yow haue is the authority of your owne Church, which Confeſſedly is lyable to Error what infallible aſſurance haue Proteſtants of the purity and incorruption of

their tranſlation: eſpecially ſeeinge many of their brethren hardly Cenſure it: <hi>How stall I approue</hi> (ſayth M.

Bronghton the great Hebritian thus ſayth, <hi>The publique tranſlation of the Scripture in English is ſuch, as it perverteth the Text of the old Teſtament in eight hundred forty and eight places: and it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Millions of Millions to reiect the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, and to runne into eternall flames:</hi> And to omitt how Bishopp Tunſtall noated two thowſand Corruptions of the Bible in Tindalls tranſlation, And allſoe how the Remiſts noated two hundred and tenn corruptions of the new Teſtament out of Greeke, which Proteſtants pretended to tranſlate, not Chardginge them with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fynite number of their Corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s repugnant to the auncyent authenticke Lattin, To omitt (I ſaye) theſe, and many other Catholique ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations for which they Iuſtly except againſt the English Bybles; I add this Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the famous Proteſtant, D.

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:34693:17"/>
confeſſeth, <hi>I haue not ſayd otherwiſe but that ſomethings in the Englishe tranſlation might be amended;</hi> Now what infallible aſſurance (I ſaye) haue they to warrant their tranſlation as incorrupt, ſeeinge the greateſt warrant they haue for it is the authority of their Church, which by their confeſſion may erre, And with what Conſcience can they Commend vnto the people their English Byble thus Corrupted for the pure word of God: <hi>(Note.)</hi> Againe what infallible aſſurance haue they of the ſence which is the life of the Letter, (to witt) that their expoſitions be the true meaninge of the holy Ghoſt; but the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of their Church, which by their owne Confeſſion is ſubiect to Erre? On the contrarye what infallible aſſurance haue they that the Catholiques Cannon, tranſlation, and expoſition of the Byble are not Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxe, but the authority of their errable Church. <hi>(Note.)</hi> Now the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if fayth be an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Knowledge, (for by falliable and errable doctrine it is impoſſible to be ſaued) can anye one with à ſafe Conſcience build all his fayth vpon ſuch à Byble whoſe Cannon, tranſlation, and interpretation hath noe infallible aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; And in this I was infinitely confirmed when afterward I read in M.<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Shillingh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worths
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:34693:18"/>
booke, approued by three Oxford Doctors as conformable to the Doctrine of the Church of England, (vzt,) that ther was noe infallible Certaynety to be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red That the Scriptures were really Gods worde. Which in effect is to ſuye, That Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants who pretend to beleiue nothinge but that which is contayned in Scriptures haue noe infallible aſſurance, whether their Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation be truely faythfull Chriſtiains or no.</p>
            <p>Moreover I demaund what certayne war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Proteſtant Miniſters and teachers haue of any Lawfull ordination or vocation for their pretenſiue reformation, and departure from the Roman Church; with whom ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme their Sect-maſters were vnyted in Communyon of fayth: but their owne errable authoritye?</p>
            <p>And conſequently ſeinge their Church can erre, how can Proteſtants be aſſured that their Church doth not erre in Condemninge the Roman Church of ſuperſtition? Or how can the vulgar be ſure they are taught the truth, when their teachers themſelues con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that their Church and all their Paſtors may lye: In à word noe Proteſtant can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any prooffe ont of Scriptures in his owne defence, or impugnation of Catholique Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:34693:18"/>
but it is gloſſed or expounded (litte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallie or miſticallie) eyther by his Church, or his owne private Spiritt? If by his Church, what Certaynty or ſecurity, when confeſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie she may erre: If by his private Spiritt, much leſſe is he free from error: And indeed by how much the more I heare and ſee Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants amayne ſtriue to maintayne, that the Church may erre in matters of Fayth, it ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders me more averſe from them, and Iuſtly to ſuſpect their Religion, for that they ſeeme to be heires of vnworthie progenitors; (to witt) of the Arians who taught all Counſells to be ſubject to error; The hereticall Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts who condemned the whole Church of Error As lykewiſe of the Wiklefians, and Waldenſes: And would yow know the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall reaſon of this their aſſertion: Truely ther is noe other then that by diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceinge the Churches authoritie whith errabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity their doctrine might be exempted from the note of hereſie, and themſelues avoyd the tytle of hereticks, for if the Church could erre in the determynation of controuerſies of Religion, why might not the decrees of the Church in Condemninge of hereticks be called in queſtion, and ſoe in fine ther would remayne noe meanes to know who are here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:34693:19"/>
for if yow goe to the ſcripture which they whith great forwardnes will alledge, and ſeclude the Churches expoſition of the true ſence, they can never be Convinced, but will allſoe eaſilye elude whatſoever Text can be brought againſt them as long as themſelues be iudges of the controverſie and ſenſe. And whem I Conſider the many doctrines re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed by Proteſtants which formerly haue been Condemned by the Church as hereticall Noveltyes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to the fayth generally and aunciently profeſſed, how can I againe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine otherwiſe, then that they maintayne this dangerous and abſurd poſition of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches errabilitie: for noe other end, then that their doctrine might be the betther freed from the Cenſure of hereſies: for what, is not the denyinge of mans frewill the hereſie of Simon Magus? Is not the affirmeinge that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction and order onght not to be obſerved in the Church of God, the hereſie of the Prepuſians?

Is not the theachinge Marryage to be as acceptable to God, as virginitie, and that it is lawful for Nonnes and Monkes to Marry the hereſies of Iouinian?

The Caracteriſticall and inſepable marke of Chriſt Church which is but one, is that in her shall allwayes be found Paſtors and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers for the Contineuall preachinge of the word, and adminiſtration of the Sacraments, the ordynarie meanes neceſſarie to Salvation To this effect are alledged theſe words out of the Apoſtle S.

Let Hoſpinian, à learned Proteſtant ſpeake Hiſt. Sacram. part. vlt. <hi>Luther Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſseth</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>that he was taught by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:34693:25"/>
that Maſſe, and cheifly private Maſſe is nought, and that beinge overcome by the Divells reaſons he abolished it,</hi> And therfore noe mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaill if Luther li. de Abrog.

Anno 1525. he maintaynes this point againſt Zwinglius ſayeinge <hi>wee dare boast that Christ was first published by vs.</hi> Soe playnlie doe the Proteſtants and Luther himſelfe frely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, an vtter defection and want of their Churches Paſtors and preaches for admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the word and Sacran ents before Luther. And indeed this manifeſtly appeareth out of the name of reformed Church. For it is impoſſible the Church should be reformed except it firſt had perished and been defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, ſoe that Proteſtants teach and profeſſe à Fayth formerly decaied and deformed, afterward reſtored and reformed: But the Catholique fayth of Chriſt Church (foe fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely built on à rock that Hell gates shall
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:34693:25"/>
never prevayle againſt it) is an incorruptible Fayth of all tymes and conſequently cannot be deformed or decay at any tyme, aud eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialy in ſuch eſſentiall matters which the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers pretend the Catholique Church to haue been deformed. <hi>(Note)</hi> Wherfore Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants that doe teach à fayth which hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was deformed and decayed, doe not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe nor teach Catholique fayth, but à novi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall innovated Religion. Seeinge then Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was the firſt Paſtor and teacher which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed it, it is evident, that imediately before Luther they had noe Paſtors nor Doctors of their Church. But peradventure yow will ſaye that the Apoſtles, Evangeliſts and all the au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cyent Fathers, pillars and lights of Gods Church, of the firſt ſixe hundred yeares were all Proteſtant Paſtors and teachers of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed doctrine, but afterward for the ſpace of nine hundred yeares ther were none extant till Luther. But this anſwere ſatisfieth not my argument, but rather Confirmeth it, (to witt) that the Proteſtant Church, hath not in all ages ever enioyed Paſtors and Doctors for the adminiſtration of the word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Which is an inſepable Marke of Chriſt true Church: for were Proteſtants Chriſt true Church, then should they haue had in all
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:34693:26"/>
ages Paſtors and Doctors to haue taught their fayth; and not decline the Iudgment of the Paſtors and Doctors of the Church, which lived in the nyne hundred yeares before Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated realy with, thoſe of the 600. Secondly the anſwere is falſe, if they will either be tryed by expreſſe Scripture or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as it will appeare by the revnnige through of the principall points, which are now controverted betwixt Catholiques and Proteſtants.</p>
            <p>Firſt then by Scripture Catholiques doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne is there playnly confirmed, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers condemned, for example, Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques haue expreſly, <hi>If thou wilt enter into life, keep the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundements</hi> Mathew 19 17.

Now to come to the tryall of the auncient Fathers, who interpreted the Scriptures with great fame and prayſe, in the Church of God, and lived within the firſt ſixe hundred yeares; which tymes they acknowledg to be pure, and therfore appeale vnto them, as beſt able to wittnes the profeſſion of fayth of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church, as beinge the Paſtors and Doctors therof.

Machiviliſme, Athiſme,</hi> &amp;c. And iudeed who but à Machauilian Athiſt, if really he had thought that there had been à God after this life to haue punished: durſt haue made ſuch à proteſtation: And to omitt the lyke vaine cracks of M. Vsher copiouſly diſcouered by Mallone in his replie to his anſwere; It is moſt true, that which Zantius à great Proteſtant ingeniouſly confeſſeth of Proteſtant writers viz: <hi>Scriptures at our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures wee detorte, to our dreames, wee boaſt of Fathers, when wee will followe nothinge leſſe then their doctrine,</hi> ſoe he in his Epiſt. 10. to Sturmius.</p>
            <p>But is not Luther then the author of the Proteſtant reformation with his brethren to be eſteemed for havinge endeavoured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the Church in diverſe manie points of Fayth, wherin they affirme for manie ages she hath erred: Surlie noe: except wee should honnor and eſteeme thoſe who renew Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient condemned hereſies, and hereticall manners, wherof Luther and his ſectaries are in à heigh degree guiltie: But as for reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in matters of fayth: wherin they pretend the Church hath erred: They are rather to be avoyded, who glories in any ſuch title: <hi>(Note)</hi> Seinge that herein they deſtroy the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:34693:36"/>
of Chriſt, and make him an impoſture for if the Church of Chriſt which he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſoe firmely to build on à Rocke, as that Hell gates should never prevaile againſt her, and vnto the Paſtors wherof he promiſed that he would aſſiſt to the Conſummation of the world, and give them the ſpiritt of Truth to abyde with them forever for the teachinge of them all truth: If I ſaye the Church of Chriſt could, or had erred in matters of fayth; as the pretended reformers affirme, Then doth it follow that they make Chriſt not ominipotent, able to vphold his Church, againſt her ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and ſoe deſtroy his Godhead: or an impoſteur in not fullfillinge what he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, becauſe the Church for Errors of fayth, and want of truth, is as much deſtroyed, as à man if he wanteth, or is deficient in any one of his eſſentiall parts, (to witt) if he be not à livinge, or à reaſonable Creture, The defect of any of theſe deſtroyes him. Soe in lyke manner if the true Church of Chriſt could Erre in fayth, or fayle in truth which is eſſentiall to the Church, it could not ſubſiſt poſſiblie: For accordinge to themſelues the Church eſſentiallie is à Congregation of faythfull where truely the worde of God and the Sacraments are adminiſtred; wherfore
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:34693:36"/>
if the worde and Sacraments haue erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly been adminiſtred for ſoe many ages as they pretend, then Conſequentlie of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie hath the Church of Chriſt perisht and Hell gates prevayled againſt her: And ſoe by this doctrine it followeth that Chriſt is not God: and that the Iewes may well reiect him, and the Goſpells anounceinge and ſpeakinge of him, as à grande impoſtour, which is moſt blaſphemous. And this doctrine of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches error in fayth, by which Proteſtants pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to iuſtifie their revolte and ſperation of there reformed congregation, from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church; is the maine motive why I ame averted from their ſocietie: and relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish their Communion; And ſoe much in proffe that the Proteſtant Congregation wants the inſepable marke of Chriſt his true Church, and in confutation of there shufling evaſions.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Iewes haue not inioyed in all ages Paſtors and Doctors to adminiſter truely the word and Sacraments, for their Church at this preſent is not Chriſtian: nor the Arians Pelagians, Manicheans, Donatiſts, Wickli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fians, &amp;c. for they haue all perished, and that in ſuch ſerte as had not Catholique Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, impugned them in their wrightings,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:34693:37"/>
and that theſe preſent reformers haue here and there renewed ſome of their hereſies, ther had ſcarcely remained any memory of them. Neither alſo the Graecians, for they were in Communion with the Roman Church, of and on, about one thowſand yeares: Soe that for ſuch à ſpace ſince the Apoſtles tyme they cannot be ſayd to haue bin à diſtinct Church from the Roman Church from whom the Patriarke of Conſtantinople was Confirmed, and the Bishopp of Rome by himſelfe or his legate preſided in all lawfull generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells, Celebrated formerly in Greece although now vnfortunatelie, as all knowes they be ſepated by reaſon of the hereſie touchinge the Holie Ghoſt &amp;c. Mereouer their ſucceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath bin interrupted by the intruſion of maine hereticall and not lawfully ordayned Bishopps, as confeſſedlie is auerred, by all Catholiques, and cannot be denied by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants: Neyther the Turkishe Mahometans, for they haue not had exiſtance in the world ever ſince Chriſt his tyme, and ſoe cannot glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of their Antiquitie, profeſſinge Chriſtian fayth, as indeed alſo not beinge Chriſtians, and ſoe conſequentlie comes not into queſtion: For here wee treat of the perpetuall exiſtence and Antiquitie of à Church profeſſinge Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:34693:37"/>
Doctrine, accordinge to the Markes which inſepablie acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paine Chriſt his Church as in the begininge was eſtablished: Finally the lyke may be demonſtrated of any other Chriſtian Church that may be aſſigned (to witt) that they want the inſepable Marke of Chriſt his Church that is the enioyinge of à continuall ſucceſſion of Paſtors in all ages to adminiſter the worde and Sacraments.</p>
            <p>On the contrarie, by the confeſſion of the Proteſtants the Romaine Church many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares was the true Church of Chriſt, and noe Proteſtant is able by evidence of any Authenticke Eccleſiaſticall hiſtorie to shew any Chriſtian Companie or Church <hi>In rerum natura</hi> more Auncient of different fayth, from whence the Romane Church departed, Therfore as yet she is and onght to be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and conſequentlie muſt enioye in all ages Paſtors and Teachers for the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the worde and Sacraments, beinge the true Church cannot fubſiſt without them. Heer then I vrge, that if the Romane Church, whoſe fayth (as teſtifieth the Apoſtle; <hi>Ep. ad Rom. c.</hi> 1. was published and renowned throughout all the world, that is with whom all the Chriſtian world had Communion of fayth, here I vrge, I ſaye, That if the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:34693:38"/>
Romane Church had departed from any other extant Church that enioyeth à ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Paſtors vp to the Apoſtles time, that they would name the time when she fell away from that Church: name the Companie of Chriſtians of more Auncient, and of different fayth from whence she is departed, Tell where this Chriſtian companie more Auncient is extant: Rehearſe the ſucceſſion of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors out of Eccleſiaſticall records: For ſeing it is à propheſie drawne from aknowledged Scriptures on all ſides: and from the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged ſence on all ſides That Chriſt Church shall forever enioy continewally Paſtors and Doctors for the worke of the Miniſtrie, that is for preaching the worde and adminiſtringe the Sacraments: The verification of this propheſie can be drawne from noe other teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie then the evidence of Eccleſiaſticall hiſtory. And truly it is à ſtrange incredible thinge, That ſeeinge Chriſt Church is ſoe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, as she is compared to à Tabernacle pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the ſonne, to à light not hidd vnder à bushell, but placed on à Candleſticke and finally to à Citty of everlaſtinge foundation, builded vpon à mountaine, which was in ſuch manner without anie limit of tyme to shine to the world (to witt) Cheiffly by her

            <p>It beinge then made manifeſt by the Text of Canonicall Scriptures, the teſtimonies of the approved auncient Fathers, yea and from the plaine Confeſſion of the Learned Proteſt: (ſo powerfull is truth as she extorts weapons from her adverſaries in her owne defence) that it is an inſepable true marke of Chriſt his Church, his ſpowſe, which is but one, that she shall allwayes enioy Paſtors and Doctors rightly to adminiſter the word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: Inſomuch as wher there is à ceſſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or want of theſe Paſtors given for the worke of the Miniſtrie, vntill wee all meet in the vnity of fayth, There can be noe Church, and conſequently noe ſalvation. And ſeeing alſoe this Marke agreeth not with Proteſt: or any other congregation ſaue only the Romane Church, as hath aboundontly bin declared, it followeth by à neceſſary ſequell, that the Romane Church is the onely Church to which wee muſt be vnited, if wee will be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: she onely beinge infallable and ſecure, in her doctrine. For if she onely beareth the cogniſſance and inſeperable marke of Chriſt his Church as hath bin demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrated, then ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily to her only, are agreable thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiues,

which by holy writt are conferred and confirmed on Chriſt his Church, to witt, that she is the foundation and pillar of Truth, 2. <hi>ad Tim.</hi> 3.

            <p>Wherfore I thus reſolue, that ſeeinge the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Church is Chriſt his true Church, if he hath any on earth, as moſt certainly he hath, and that in no age or ſeaſon Chriſt his true Church can erre in matters of fayth: I ame reſolued, I ſaye, to receive for à verity of fayth that which the Romane Church hath or shall declare to be ſuch, and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary reiect and diſclayme from whatſoever doctrine she hath, or shall diſapproue or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne, as repugnant to Gods worde written or vnwritten.</p>

Let then her Athiſtical aduerſaries preſſe never ſoe much to receive nothinge but that which by their naturall reaſon they can be convinced of, I ame prepared accordinge to the advice of the Apoſtle to Captiuite my vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandinge obſequiouſly to the myſteries of fayth, as beinge ſupernaturall and tranſeen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge naturall reaſon: And therfore will I reſt in the Iudgment of the Church, which is ever directed by à ſupernaturall Agent, that tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth her all Truth: Hee that ſeeketh fayth ſeeketh not reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Sayth Tertullian and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſologus, Athens hath nothing to intermeddle with Hieruſalem, nor the Academy with the Church; our ſchoole is the porch of Solomon which teacheth vs that wee muſt ſearch for God with ſimplicity of Hart, and not with fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous curioſitie of naturall reaſon; what wronge doth the Creator to vs, if he would ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue vs beleiue more then wee are able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend?

tooshort to vndertake ſuch à flight: while one proceedeth in this Manner, fayth wilbe noe true fayth, but à fanteſy or opinion; If S.

Churches authority lyable to Error in decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe what is truly Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formable or repugnant to the worde: I value not their erronious Iudgments, knowinge full well that she is ever aſſiſted by the ſpirit of all teachinge truth, accordinge to the infallible promiſe of Chriſt and ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not teach any thinge repugnant to the worde of God, noe more then God can teach contrary to himſelfe, who is her dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor: And therfore whoſoever harkenneth vnto her voyce, that is to the generall Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Paſtors and teachers, heareth the voyce and word of Chriſt, ſoe that the worde of the Church is the worde of Chriſt: Whence S.

            <p>And why, I pray, is this moſt inſolent mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:34693:43"/>
to queſtion what the Church profeſſes and practiſeth, but becauſe this in effect is to denie, or diſpute againſt the Canonicall Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures aknowledged on both ſides? For if in the aknowledged worde of God, by moſt cleare teſtimonies, the authority of Chriſt his Church is ſoe highly magnified as that she is ſtyled the pillar and foundation of Truth, the vnſpotted Spouſe without wrinkle; his body, his Lott, his Inheritance and kingdome given him in this world, in which he hath placed Apoſtles, Doctors and Paſtors to the Conſummation of the Electe, which Doctors are ever aſſiſted by the ſpirit that teacheth them all truth, and accompanied hy our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to the Conſummation of the world, who Comaunds vs to harken to his Spouſe the Church: <hi>Sub poena</hi> of beinge reputed Heathens or Publicans: Tell me then is not this moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent madneſſe to call her profeſſion and practice in queſtion: <hi>(Note)</hi> To be ſoe Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtianly proud, as to preferr our owne Iudgments and expoſitions of the worde, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Church which is directed by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Truth; Is not this in words to boaſt much of Scriptures, and indeed not to follow them, for if yow ſearch the Scriptures, that is profoundly, and not ſuperficiaſly or mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:34693:43"/>
conſider them, yow shall finde that the ſame are they that give teſtimony of her, and how she is to be obeyed and as eagerly followed.</p>
            <p>Wherfore to draw to à Concluſion, ſeeinge the true Church of Chriſt which is but one, cannot Erre in matters of Fayth, and onely the Romane Church beareth the vnſeperable marke of it: To vſe the Apoſtle S.
