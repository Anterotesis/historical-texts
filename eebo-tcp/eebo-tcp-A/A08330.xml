            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

VVal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi> in granting that very part of my Antecedent which before he denyed, I proceeded a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and argued thus against him.</p>
               <p>If your Church may erre in one point necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to saluation, it may as well erre in another, and so ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> propose nothing vndoubtedly to be belieued,

as an article of fayth. Which inference though <hi>M. VValker</hi> denyed, and with many cauillations labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to diuert, yet it euidently followeth, as I thus declare.</p>
               <p>That Church which hath not sufficient autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to persuade all the mysteries of fayth she proposeth, to be infallibly true, can propose nothing vndoubtedly to be belieued as an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of fayth.</p>
               <p>But your Church which may erre now in one point, now in another, at least for a tyme, hath not sufficient authority to persuade all the mysteries of fayth she proposeth to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly true.</p>
               <p>Therefore, your Church can propose nothing vndoubtedly to be belieued, as an article of fayth.</p>
               <p>For seeing the Articles in which your Church may erre, are not specified by God, nor knowne to your followers; they may iustly feare, and suspect least those she now proposeth, be some of them, in which she may erre: But with feare and suspition no fayth can stand, nothing can she propose which ought vndoubtedly to be belieued, as <hi>S.

               <p>I must tell you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that your Minor proposition is false. For a Church may be so farre subiect to errour, that it may haue a possibility to erre, yet not be void of the whole and infallible fayth. It is one thing to be subiect to er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and another to erre actually: We hold, that our Church may erre, but doe not thinke that it doth erre in any fundamentall point.</p>

               <p>But your Church which is subiect to errour, which hath a possibility to erre, in a funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall point of fayth, is fallible.</p>
               <p>Therfore, it is not also infallible in the whole &amp; entire fayth: Vnlesse it may be in one and the same thing both fallible, and infallible, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to errour, and not subiect, which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible.</p>

                     </hi> 24. 25.</note> well prooueth by these 3. Reasons. First, because nothing can belong to the habit or act of fayth, except that which appertaineth to theyr for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall obiect, and in such sort as it is instilled, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed, and drawne from thence: Euen as no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour can be seene, vnlesse it be garnished with the beames of light. But to prime Verity no falsity can belong, not only any actuall falshood, but not so much as any thing that hath a possibility to be fals; no more then any pronesse to euill can appertayne to soueraigne goodnes, or the least shadow of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to light inaccessable. Therfore Fayth, which hath prime Verity for her obiect, must not only be free from actuall errour, but from all lyablenes therunto, or possibility of erring. Secondly, euery act, euery habit, is necessarily lincked with equall proportion of certainty, or assurance, with the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the obiect, of which it borroweth its dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, nature, and forme: Wherfore as the prime Verity, and testimony of God; so the habit, and act of Fayth, are both infallible. Thirdly, Fayth is an intellectuall Vertue which doth perfect, &amp; eno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the faculty of our Vnderstanding, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not receaue the dye of perfection from any other thing then that which is true, because that only, as all Philosophers teach, is her proper, &amp; peculiar

               <p>I acknowledge the reuelation of scripture, the promulgation of Christ sufficient in themselues; yet not in respect of the Apostles capacity; for they were yet rude and weake of vnderstanding, they had not as yet that inward illustration and light of the holy Ghost, those outward motiues, and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of credibility, which did binde them to giue infallible assent to so deep a mystery. They assen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and belieued, that all was true which Christ sayd, all true which the Scriptures reuealed concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his Resurrection; yet they knew not whether the sense and meaning of those passages were to be taken truely or enigmatically, properly or figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiuely. Of this only were they ignorant; and this
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:25547:28"/>
ignorance proceeded from their imbecillity and weakenesse, and not from the insufficiency of holy Scripture.</p>

But being in a monstrous rage, because his pryde could not brooke such a fowle ouerthrowe, I thought good to giue way to his chafing fit, and so departed with these very wordes: <hi>VVell, well; I perceiue my distinction hath choked your argument, you are not able to proceed.</hi> Now, after that I arose and walked hard by, the other Priest that assisted me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicating the answere that I had giuen, sayd.</p>

               <p>It is not much to be meruailed, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles at the first conceaued not aright the Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Christ: for the Apostolicall Church was then in her infancy; it was newly raysed, not wholy finished; begun, but not perfected; The Euangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call law was deliuered, yet not fully established.</p>
               <p>And can this vndergoe the censure of any other doctrine, then sound and orthodoxall? Or could <hi>M. Walker</hi> iustly vaunt of any allegation he brought
