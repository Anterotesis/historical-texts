            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>SEVERAL
INSTANCES
OF THE
WRONGS and OPPRESSIONS
By Q's and R's, ſuffered by the
Sailers of the Engliſh Navy,
FROM
The beginning of the Late WAR: Moſt humbly preſented to the
Fountain of Juſtice, the Parliament of ENGLAND.</head>
            <p>IT is the Misfortune of the poor Sailers of the Engliſh-Navy, to have few or no
Friends to take their Part, or repreſent their Grievances to the Parliament, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to have them Redreſs'd: Juſtice indeed carries an equal Ballance, but both the
Scales hang over the Earth, without any reſpect to the Sea. Tho' our Sailers are
as true to their Country as the Needle of their Compaſs is to the Courſe they Steer,
as faithful as the Steel to the Loadſtone; yet are they little minded by thoſe in whoſe
Power it is to do them Juſtice, as if their Generation were Monſtrous, becauſe their
lives are Amphibious; are born on the Land, and do Service on the Water, yet have
common Juſtice on neither: They are <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> but till they are 16 or 18 Years of Age,
then arrived to the <hi>Ne plus ultra</hi> of their Liberty, their Freedom being in perpetual dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
liable to be invaded by every Preſs-Maſter; and thoſe which were born to the Rights
and Immunities of an <hi>Engliſh-man,</hi> has all his Property knock'd on the head at once, and
hawl'd away and conſtrain'd on board Ship, an Honourable ſort of Vaſſalage. Thus Wives
have their Husbands torn from their Arms, Mothers the only hopes of their Families
forc'd into Confinement more durable and uneaſy than that of their Wombs, Fathers and
Sons Impriſoned in one Wooden Goal. But were this all, the Bondage would ſeem more
eaſy; the Mariners never think their Service to their Country too much, they plough
the wide Ocean, contend with the raging Billows of the Deep; and with a Bravery pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culier
to the Sons of the Sea, meet and fight their Enemy with a wonderful Contentment
and Alacrity, in defence of their Country, and thoſe Rights and Privileges of which they
have ſo ſmall a ſhare. Indeed their Country has not been backward in making a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Allowance ſuitable to the Bravery of Men engag'd in ſuch dangerous Enterprizes;
but their ill Stars have laid them under ſuch diſmal Circumſtances, under ſuch a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous
and unparallel'd Conduct, that in the midſt of the Plenty provided for them, they
have been in the greateſt Wants. It is commonly obſerv'd in dealings amongſt Mankind,
that the Service of Labourers require preſent Mony, and the Laws of the Realm have a
great reſpect to the Wages of Servants, allowing them to be firſt paid, even before Bonds,
or any previous Obligations of a contrary nature: But ſome wou'd have every Sailer
an Exlex, and would make us believe that the ſame decorum of Juſtice is not to be us'd
in States and Governments, as is practiſed amongſt Men of inferior Ranks and Qualities:
However, as the Debts to the Sailers are National, it ought to be a National Concern;
and Grievances of this kind being Un-redreſs'd, may procure a National Judgment.</p>
            <p>That the Q's and R's upon the Navy-Books, are a common Grievance to the poor Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
of Sailers, and their Attorneys, will loudly juſtifie to their great Grief and Loſs.</p>
            <p>The <hi>R,</hi> upon the Navy-Books is an immovable Letter, very ſignificant of Injuſtice,
and ſerves there as a Period in other Books, putting a full ſtop to the Sailors Pay; and
tho' the Perſon that ſets the permanent <hi>R,</hi> may be but a Cypher himſelf in the account of
Juſtice and true Worth, yet his Letter <hi>R,</hi> is productive of vaſt Sums of Mony, into the
Pocket of ſome Body or other, to the Ruin of the Seamen. This <hi>R,</hi> in Navy Language
or Character (which you pleaſe) ſignifies <hi>Run,</hi> and this Run is of different Meaning and
Signification too, it is Crambo'd and tortur'd moſt damnably, forc'd to expreſs the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of any thing the Commanders of the Navy pleaſe.</p>
            <p>If a poor Man be ſet Sick a Shoar, ſo that he cannot get a Board his Ship before ſhe
Sails, then he is made Run upon the Books: If he be a Shoar by the Captain's Order
about the Ship's Buſineſs, and ſome Orders from Above force the Ship out of Harbour
before he can get a Board, the Ship runs away from him, and he from the Ship at the
<pb facs="tcp:57748:2"/>
ſame time; if he go immediately on Board another Ship, yet he is Run ſtill. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movable
<hi>R,</hi> of the Navy, is as fixt as the Law of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians.</hi> If he make
Intereſt at the Admiralty to get the <hi>R</hi> taken off, (for 'tis in the Power of thoſe Men you
know to do mighty Wonders) why then his Petition comes out with this pretty Device
at the bottom, read the <hi>11th of February</hi> refus'd, <hi>J. Burchett.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But farther to diſcover the meaning of this ſignificant Letter <hi>R,</hi> I ſhall give an account
how it is apply'd to the poor Sailers upon the Navy-Books.</p>
            <p>I. Such as never deſign'd to deſert the Service, but being return'd from long Voyages,
and their Ships being either in Port or Dock, have adventured to viſit their Friends, in
order to provide themſelves with Apparel and other Neceſſaries, and perhaps have met
with Preſs-Gangs belonging to other Ships, and forc'd on Board; this has been eſteemed
by the Navy a Deſertion, and they have made ſuch Sailers <hi>Run,</hi> upon their Books.</p>
            <p>II. Thoſe that have been turn'd over from one Ship to another, and after having
ſerv'd ſome time in the latter, their Tickets for their ſervice in the former Ships have
been deliver'd them, and after having ſerv'd on Board ſeveral other Ships, perhaps two
or three Years after being ſet Sick a Shoar, the firſt Tickets with the reſt, have been
made <hi>Quaeri'd</hi> or <hi>Run,</hi> and their Wages Forfeited.</p>
            <p>Now, that ſuch Practices as theſe are contrary to all the Law, Juſtice and Reaſon in
the World, is demonſtrable.</p>
            <p>I. Such as have their Tickets given them, are ſuppos'd to be guilty of no Crime at that
Juncture; and ſuch Tickets are and have been eſteemed as the King's Bonds and Bills
of Exchange, and were formerly paid upon Sight. Now, it is very hard, That a Sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
tranſgreſſing in one Ship, ſhould become ſo guilty, as by that Crime to forfeit all his
Wages in former Ships: So that good Service and bad, according to Navy Juſtice, are
a like Puniſhable.</p>
            <p>II. Many well-affected People to His Majeſty's Service, and out of Charity to their
diſtreſſed Neighbours, have ſupplied many Sailers with Mony, to the full value of their
Tickets, and when they come to the Navy to be paid, receive nothing but an <hi>R</hi> for
their Mony.</p>
            <p>III. The Quaerying and Running of ſuch Tickets, have abominably leſſen'd the Credit
of the Navy in reſpect of Wages, and made the moſt Glorious Navy in the World, the
moſt Scandalous by ſuch barbarous Abuſes, inſomuch that Tickets formerly ſold at <hi>2 s.
6 d. per</hi> Pound, are now Sold for Seven, Eight, Ten and Twelve Shillings loſs.</p>
            <p>The next thing to be Conſider'd is the Letter <hi>Q.</hi> upon the Navy Books, which ſtands
there as near Injuſtice, as it does to the Letter <hi>R</hi> in the Alphabet. This <hi>Q</hi> is generally
put upon ſuch as are ſet ſick a Shoar. And then the poor Sailer is to quaery for Juſtice,
which he may do till he is Blind, and never find it. That this Practice is Barbarous and
Inhuman, is very evident.</p>
            <p>I. It ſinks the Labourers Hire into private Pockets, deprives diſtreſſed Families of their
Bread, purchaſed by the hazard of human Life, and brings unneceſſary charge upon Pariſhes.</p>
            <p>II. This <hi>Q</hi> is a new Letter in the Navy Books, Quaeries being never heard of till the
Year 1690. before which time, every Man ſet ſick a Shoar had his Wages paid him, and
was diſcharged from the Service.</p>
            <p>III. The great Sickneſs which at and ſince that time happen'd in the Fleet, was the
Foundation of theſe Quaeries; a very hard Caſe, that a Sailer muſt loſe his Money be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he has loſt his Health in the Service; muſt have bad Pay, becauſe he has been poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd
with bad Proviſions.</p>
            <p>IV. Many, if not moſt of thoſe, who have been ſet ſick a Shoar, have thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
Diſcharg'd, according to former Cuſtom, being altogether ignorant of the new
Practice of the Navy.</p>
            <p>V. Many that have been long Voyages, and ſick for many Months together, ſeeing
the Major part of the Ships Crew Bury'd, have been thereby deſhearten'd to go a board
Ship again, Diſeaſes being more dreadful to Sailers than Battle or Storm.</p>
            <p>VI. Nor can it be rationally expected, that ſuch as have contracted Indiſpoſitions and
Diſtempers, by unwholſom Proviſions, or a contagious Air, ſhould (after a Month's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment
in ſick Quarters, or labouring 6 or 12 Months under their Maladies in an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpital)
be fit to return aboard Ship, or be capable of doing His Majeſty ſervice; but the
contrary is evident, by the vaſt numbers that died ſoon after their return on Board, as
well as thoſe that were ſet ſick a Shoar.</p>
            <p>And wou'd it not now be juſt to pay ſuch Men their Wages? Wou'd it not be for
the Honour of His Majeſty, for the Reputation and Credit of the Navy to conſider their
Caſes and pay the Debts due from the Nation to ſuch?</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. As have been ſet Sick on Shoar ſince the concluſion of the Peace.</item>
               <item>2. To the Executors and Attorneys of ſuch as died in Sick Quarters, Hoſpitals or Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Ships.</item>
               <item>
                  <pb facs="tcp:57748:3"/>
3. To ſuch as after Recovery entred on Board any of his Majeſty's Ships.</item>
               <item>4. To ſuch as have been Wounded or hurt, and receiv'd Penſions, or Smart-Money for
the ſame.</item>
               <item>5. To ſuch as continued Six Months, or upwards, in Sick Quarters or Hoſpitals, or have
been diſcharged from thence as Incurable.</item>
               <item>6. To ſuch as the Captains of Ships have diſcharged by Tickets, as unſerviceable, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
either Sick, Lame or Blind, &amp;c.</item>
            </list>
            <p>This Uſage of free born Engliſhmen, might move Compaſſion in any but in thoſe
whoſe Buſineſs it is to cheat them, and raiſe their own Fortunes out of their Ruins.
This indeed is a miſerable Scene of humane Cruelty, unknown to the Heathen Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and yet practiſed in a Chriſtian Country, built on the Pillars of good and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom
Laws, and under a Government for no other reaſon that I know, but on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to deſtroy ſuch Arbitrary Proceedings, and to diſpenſe common Juſtice to all
Men. There is little more difference betwixt a Gally Slave and an Engliſh Sailer, than
that one ſerves in expectation of Pay, and the other without it; yet one is ſometimes
as well paid as the other. This barbarous uſage of Mariners, have made them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of deſerting our Ships of War, and taking Merchants Service, forſake their
Country, and Sailwith Foreigners, in hopes of better Juſtice and Uſage abroad than
they have met with at home. This barbarous Uſage has made many Thouſands of
them turn Pirates during the laſt War; and thoſe that turn Free-booters are generally
the Flower and Youth of the Seamen, ſo that in time our Ships ſhall be Man'd only
with decrepit old Age, and the refuſe of the Sea, to the weakening of the Nation
and Government; for every Sailer loſt is a Stone taken out of our National Walls, which
ſuffering ſuch continual Dilapidations, will at laſt tumble down, and leave us expoſed
to the Inſults of any Invader.</p>
            <p>And after all, Pray what is become of the Money that was ordered to pay the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
upon whom the <hi>R's</hi> and <hi>Q's</hi> have been put? If it remains ſtill in the
King's Hands, there is yet ſome hopes of Relief left to the miſerable Sailers; but if it
be otherwiſe diſpoſed of, their Diſeaſe ſeems Incurable. When we look into the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Office
and ſee there ſome Clerks at <hi>30 l. per Annum</hi> purchaſing Eſtates, others turning
Merchants, and employing vaſt Sums of Money in Trade, we may give a ſhrewd
Gueſs what is become of the Poor Sailers Money. And how ſhall their Creditors be
paid? How ſhall their Widows and numerous Fatherleſs Children be provided for?
Will not the charge to the ſeveral Pariſhes, upon this account, be heavier upon the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
than the Taxes during the War.</p>
            <p>Dwelling ſo long upon the <hi>R's,</hi> and <hi>Q's,</hi> which to me appear like Figures in Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
for the Projectors of their meaning in Navy Dialect have plac'd them backwards,
as Witches ſay their Prayers: I had almoſt forgot the Injuries daily committed to
thoſe Sailers who have chearfully Regiſtred themſelves, to be the more ready upon all
occaſions to ſerve their Country, the Parliament has ſettled on every one of them Forty
Shillings a Year for their Encouragement; and laſt Year the Officers of that Regiſtry
have receiv'd 80000 l. to pay off thoſe Tickets, out of which they have only diſtributed
35000 l. and refuſe to pay one Farthing more, pretending they have not Money, ſo that
Forty five thouſand Pounds is ſunk unaccountably into ſome bodies Pocket.</p>
            <p>All theſe things are worthy the Conſideration of our Repreſentatives in Parliament,
who are the only Perſons can redreſs Grievances of this nature.</p>
            <p>Now for ſome ſhort Account of the Regiſter-Office and conclude; there were migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
things promis'd from this Office, and truly had it been well founded and managed,
it might have been of very good Service to the Nation; for 'tis more then time, ſome
meaſures ſhould have been taken to retrieve our ſinking Navy; but this being contriv'd
and govern'd by the Projectors, who ſeem rather by their Carriage to ruin or drive all the
Seamen out of the Kingdom, than to encourage and keep them here, has had the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
effect expected by Parliament, that made a large Proviſion for this Office, and made
a Calculation of 30000 Seamen to be Regiſtred, now of theſe 30000 there is about
15000 Thouſand Regiſtred, which moſt of them Regiſtred themſelves a-Board of Ship
before the Concluſion of the Peace, being chiefly threatn'd and compel'd to it; but ſince
the Peace there have been a very inconſiderable number have Regiſtred, and one may
believe now the Regiſter-Office may ſit down contented, and ſave the charge it puts the
Kingdom to for any more Men of any ſort that will Regiſter themſelves. But now to
ſhew what may be depended upon from thoſe already Regiſtred, half of them are Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
who are forc'd to do it, or otherwiſe loſe their Employments; but as they have
not the 40 <hi>s.</hi> a Year, provided for every Seaman by the Act, ſo they are not oblig'd to
ſurrender themſelves to the Service, but they were only compell'd to Regiſter themſelves,
not for any uſe they were that way to the Kingdom, but for Encouragement to the
Seamen, or to wheedle them to follow their Example. A moiety of this remaining 7000
are Land Men or wretched Creatures taken or Preſt into the Service, more to make up
<pb facs="tcp:57748:4"/>
the Complement, and rather peſter a Ship, when Seamen could not be got: above half
the remainder, which we will ſuppoſe to be Seamen, are at Sea in Merchants ſervice on
Foreign Voyages, the Act obliging none to ſtay at home to wait a Call; ſo that in fine,
by a modeſt Calculation, the Nation in the utmoſt Exigency cannot rely upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter-Office
for Two thouſand able Seamen of the 30000 which was expected in ſix
Months time: But to give ſome Particulars how this Office is a Diſcouragement, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
an Oppreſſion in many Reſpects to Seamen than an Encouragement, as was promis'd
to the Parliament when 'twas Eſtabliſh'd by Law, at a great charge to the Nation.</p>
            <p>I. The Seaman that Regiſtred himſelf was promis'd by the Act, 40 <hi>s. per Annum,</hi>
which is a great deal in a poor Seaman's Pocket, and Eſtimates given every Seſſion to
the Parliament yearly of this particular Charge, and if I miſtake not, Fonds rais'd and
receiv'd for this uſe: Now the Seamen have never receiv'd a Farthing of this; but on
the contrary, the Seaman is glad to ſell his Regiſter Ticket for 10 <hi>s.</hi> in the Pound,
which every Body will not give, for to my knowledge, People that have made enquiry
at the Regiſter-Office how, and when theſe Tickets would be paid, 'twas anſwer'd,
'twas not yet determin'd, nor did they believe ever would; an excellent Encouragement
to Seamen; but to help out the matter, here is a Tax levy'd upon every Seaman in
<hi>England</hi> of 6 Pence <hi>per Menſem,</hi> toward the ſupport of this Eſtabliſhment, which I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
heard any Seaman the better for: Again, the Act ſays, the King's Ships ſhall be
Man'd with Regiſtred Seamen; they to have the Preference, and out of them only are
the inferiour Officers to be made; now ſeveral Captains have been put to a Plaguy puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle
on this account, for by reaſon of the diſcouragements before mentioned, very few
good Seamen have Regiſtred themſelves, ſo that a Captain cannot find enough, or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
out of his Regiſtred Men to make Officers of.</p>
            <p>There might be a great deal more ſaid of the ill Uſage of theſe poor Creatures;
but to avoid prolixity I ſhall omit it now, and humbly hope this already ſaid, may be
worth the Conſideration of the Supreme Judicature; it being deſign'd to no other end,
than that in doing Juſtice, and ſhewing Mercy to theſe poor People, it may at laſt turn
to be of the greateſt ſervice to the Nation.</p>
