            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>
               </hi> Comedy, called the <hi>Guardian,</hi> and made by me when I was very Young, was Acted formerly at <hi>Camebridge,</hi> and several times after privately during the troubles, as I am told, with good approbation, as it has been lately too at <hi>Dublin</hi> There being many things in it which I disliked, and finding my self for some dayes idle, and alone in the Countrey, I fell upon the changing of it almost wholly, as now it is, and as it was play'd since at his Royal Highness's Theatre under this New name. It met at the first representation with no favourable reception, and I think there was something of Faction against it, by the early appearance of some mens disapprobation before they had seen enough of it to build their dislike upon their Iudgment. Afterwards it got some ground, and found Friends as well as Adversarys. In which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition I should willingly let it dye, if the main imputations under which it suffered, had been shot only against my Wit or Art in these matters, and not directed against the tenderest parts of human re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, good Nature, good Manners, and Piety it self. The first clamour which some malitious persons raised, and made a great
<pb facs="tcp:64428:3"/>
noise with, was, That it was a piece intended for abuse and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre against the Kings party. Good God! Against the Kings par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? After having served it twenty years during all the time of their misfortunes and afflictions, I must be a very rash and impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent person if I chose out that of their Restitution to begin a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with them. I must be too much a Madman to be trusted with such an Edg'd Tool as Comedy. But first, why should either the whole party (as it was once distinguisht by that name, which I hope is abolisht now by Universal Loyalty) or any man of virtue or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in it, believe themselves injured or at all concerned, by the representation of the faults and follies of a few who in the General division of the Nation had crowded in among them? In all mixt numbers (which is the case of Parties) nay, in the most entire and continued Bodies there are often some degenerate and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted parts, which may be cast away from that, and even cut off from this Unity, without any infection of scandal to the remaining Body. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> with all her arrogance, and her wide pretences of certainty in all truths, and exemption from all Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, does not clap on this enchanted Armour of Infallibility upon all her particular Subjects, nor is offended at the reproof even of her greatest Doctors. We are not, I hope, become such Puritans our selves as to assume the Name of the Congregation of the Spotless. It is hard for any Party to be so Ill as that no Good, Impossible to be so Good as that no Ill should be found among them. And it has been the perpetual privilege of Satyre and Comedy to pluck their vices and follies though not their Persons out of the Sanctuary of any Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. A Cowardly ranting Souldier, an Ignorant Charlatanical Doctor, a foolish Cheating Lawyer, a silly Pedantical Scholar, hav, alwayes been, and still are the Principal Subjects of all Comedye without any scandal given to those Honourable Professions, or ever taken by their severest Professors; And, if any good Physician or Divine should be offended with me here for inveighing against a Quack, or for finding Deacon <hi>Soaker</hi> too often in the Butteryes, my respect and reverence to their callings would make me troubled at
<pb facs="tcp:64428:3"/>
their displeasure, but I could not abstain from taking them for very Cholerique and Quarrelsome persons. What does this therefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to, if it were true which is objected? But it is far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so; for the representation of two Sharks about the Town (fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows merry and Ingenious enough, and therefore admitted into better companyes than they deserve, yet withall too very scoundrels, which is no unfrequent Character at <hi>London</hi>) the representation I say of these as Pretended Officers of the Royal Army, was made for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther purpose but to show the World, that the vices and extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies imputed vulgarly to the Cavaliers, were really committed by Aliens who only usurped that name, and endeavoured to cover the reproach of their Indigency or Infamy of their Actions with so ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable a Title. So that the business was not here to correct or cut off any natural branches, though never so corrupted or Luxuriant, but to separate and cast away that vermine which by sticking so close to them had done great and considerable prejudice both to the Beauty and Fertility of the Tree; And this is as plainly said, and as often inculcated as if one should write round about a Signe, This is a Dog, this is a Dog, out of over-much caution lest some might happen to mistake it for a Lyon, Therefore when this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny could not hold (for the case is cleer, and will take no colour) Some others sought out a subtiler hint to traduce me upon the same score, and were angry that the person whom I made a true Gentleman, and one both of considerable Quality and Sufferings in the Royal party, should not have a fair and noble Character through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, but should submit in his great extremities to wrong his Niece for his own Relief. This is a refined exception, such as I little foresaw, nor should with the dulness of my usual Charity, have found out against another man in twenty years. The truth is, I did not intend the Character of a <hi>Hero,</hi> one of exemplary virtue, and as <hi>Homer</hi> often terms such men, Unblameable, but an ordinary jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial Gentleman, commonly called a Good Fellow, one not so consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious as to sterve rather than do the least Injury, and yet endowed with so much sense of Honour as to refuse when that necessity was
<pb facs="tcp:64428:4"/>
removed, the gain of five thousand pounds which he might have taken from his Niece by the rigour of a Forfeiture; And let the frankness of this latter generosity so expiate for the former frailty, as may make us not ashamed of his Company, for if his true Metal be but equal to his Allay, it will not indeed render him one of the Finest sorts of men, but it will make him Current, for ought I know, in any party that ever yet was in the World. If you be to choose parts for a Comedy out of any noble or elevated rank of persons, the most proper for that work are the worst of that kind. Comedy is hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of her Nature, and has alwayes been bred low, so that she knows not how to behave her self with the great or the accomplisht. She does not pretend to the brisk and bold Qualities of Wine, but to the Stomachal Acidity of Vinegar, and therefore is best placed among that sort of people which the <hi>Romans</hi> call The Lees of <hi>Romulus.</hi> If I had designed here the celebration of the Virtues of our Friends, I would have made the Scene nobler where I intended to erect their Statues. They should have stood in Odes, and Tragedies, and Epique Poems, (neither have I totally omitted those greater testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of my esteem of them) <hi>Sed nunc non erat his Locus,</hi> &amp;c. And so much for this little spiny objection which a man cannot see without a Magnifying Glass. The next is enough to knock a man down, and accuses me of no less than Prophaness. Prophane, to deride the Hypocrisie of those men whose skuls are not yet bare up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Gates since the publique and just punishment of it? But there is some imitation of Scripture Phrases; God forbid; There is no representation of the true face of Scripture, but only of that Vizard which these Hypocrites (that is, by interpretation Actors with a Vizard) draw upon it. It is Prophane to speak of <hi>Harrisons</hi> return to Life again, when some of his friends really profest their belief of it, and he himself had been said to promise it? A man may be so imprudently scrupulous as to find prophaness in any thing either said or written by applying it under some similitude or other to some expressions in Scripture. This nicety is both vain and endless. But I call God to witness, that rather than one tittle
<pb facs="tcp:64428:4"/>
should remain among all my writings which according to my se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verest judgment should be found guilty of the crime objected, I would myself burn and extinguish them all together. Nothing is so detestably lewd and rechless as the derision of things sacred, and would be in me more unpardonable than any man else, who have endeavoured to root out the ordinary weeds of Poetry, and to plant it almost wholly with Divinity. I am so far from allowing any loose or irreverent expressions in matters of that Religion which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that I am very tender in this point even for the grossest er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of Conscientious persons, They are the properest object (me thinks) both of our <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>itty and Charity too; They are the innocent and white Sectaries, in comparison of another kind who engraft Pride upon Ignorance, Tyranny upon Liberty, and upon all their Heresies, Treason and Rebellion. These are Principles so destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the Peace and Society of Mankind that they deserve to be persued by our serious Hatred, and the putting a Mask of Sanctity upon such Devils is do Ridiculous, that it ought to be exposed to contempt and laughter. They are indeed Prophane, who counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit the softness of the voyce of Holiness to disguize the roughness of the hands of Impiety, and not they who with reverence to the thing which the others dissemble, deride nothing but their Dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation. If some piece of an admirable Artist should be ill Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyed even to ridiculousness by an ignorant hand, and another Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter should undertake to draw that Copy, and make it yet more ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, to shew apparently the difference of the two works, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of the latter, will not every man see plainly that the abuse is intended to the foolish Imitation, and not to the Excellent Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal? I might say much more to confute and confound this very false and malitious accusation, but this is enough I hope to cleer the matter, and is I am afraid too much for a Preface to a work of so little consideration. As for all other objections which have been or may be made against the Invention or Elocution, or any thing else which comes under the Critical Iurisdiction, let it stand or fall as it can answer for it self, for I do not lay the great stress of my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
<pb facs="tcp:64428:5"/>
upon a Structure of this Nature, much less upon the slight Reparations only of an Old and unfashionable Building. There is no Writer but may fail sometimes in point of Wit, and it is no less frequent for the Auditors to fail in point of Iudgment. I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive plainly by dayly experience that Fortune is Mistris of the Theatre, as <hi>Tully</hi> sayes it is of all popular Assemblies. No man can tell sometimes from whence the Invisible winds arise that move them. There are a multitude of people who are truly and onely Spectators at a play, without any use of their Understanding, and these carry it sometimes by the strength of their Number. There are others who use their Understanding too much, who think it a sign of weakness or stupidity to let any thing pass by them unattaqued, and that the Honour of their Iudgment (as some Brutals imagine of their Courage) consists in Quarrelling with every thing. We are therefore wonderfull wise men, and have a fine business of it, we who spend our time in Poetry, I do sometimes laugh, and am of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten angry with my self when I think on it, and if I had a Son in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined by Nature to the same folly, I believe I should bind him from it, by the strictest conjurations of a paternal Blessing. For what can be more ridiculous than to labour to give men delight, whilst they labour on their part more earnestly to take offence? to expose ones self voluntarily and frankly to all the dangers of that narrow passage to unprofitable Fame, which is defended by rude multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of the Ignorant, and by armed Troops of the Malitious? If we do ill many discover it and all despise us, if we do well but few men find it out, and fewer entertain it kindly. If we commit er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors there is no parson, if we could do wonders there would be but little thanks, and that too extorted from unwilling Givers. But some perhaps may say, Was it not alwayes thus? Do you expect a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular privilege that was never yet enjoyed by any Poet? were the ancient <hi>Graecian,</hi> or noble <hi>Roman</hi> Authors, was <hi>Virgil</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self exempt from this Passibility, <hi>Qui melior multis quam tu fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it, Improbe, rebus,</hi> Who was in many things thy better far, Thou impudent Pretender? As was said by <hi>Lucretius</hi> to a
<pb facs="tcp:64428:5"/>
person who took it ill that he was to Dye, though he had seen so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny do it before him who better deserved Immortality; and this is to repine at the natural condition of a Living Poet, as he did at that of a Living Mortal. I do not only ackowledge the Prae-e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence of <hi>Virgil</hi> (whose Footsteps I adore) but submit to many of his <hi>Roman</hi> Brethren, and I confess that even they in their own times were not secure from the assaults of Detraction (though <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race</hi> brags at last, <hi>Jam dente minùs mordeor invido</hi>) but then the Barkings of a few were drown'd in the Applause of all the rest of the World, and the Poison of their Bitings extiguisht by the Antidote of great rewards, and great encouragements, which is a way of curing now out of use, and I really profess that I neither expect, nor think I deserve it. Indolency would serve my turn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of Pleasure; But the case is not so well; for though I comfort my self with some assurance of the favour and affection of very many candid and good natured (and yet too judicious and even Critical) persons, yet this I do affirm, that from all which I have written I never received the least benefit, or the least advantage, but on the contrary have felt sometimes the effects of Malice and Misfortune.</p>

But that's all one, I'me sure h'as rais'd a fine Estate out o' nothing by his Industry in these Times: An' I had not been a Beast too— but Heaven's will be done, I could not ha' don't with a good conscience. Well, <hi>Dick,</hi> I'le go talk with her mother about this matter, and examine fully what her Estate is, for unless it prove a good one, I tell you true, <hi>Dick,</hi> I'me o' your Opinion, not to marry such a Rogues daughter.</p>

                     <p>Patience, Madam, will be no Virtue requisite for us, whilst you are pleas'd to stay here; Ha, ha! <hi>Cutter</hi>! that lit pretty pat 'ifaith for a beginning,

                     <p>Is your friend going, Sir?</p>

                     <speaker>Cut.</speaker>
                     <p>Friend, Madam? — (I hope I shall be even with him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently) he's a merry fellow that your Uncle and I divert our selves withall.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Luc.</speaker>
                     <p>What is he? pray Sir.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Cut.</speaker>
                     <p>That's something difficult to tell you, Madam; But he has been all things. He was a Scholar once, and since a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, but broke the first half year; after that he serv'd a Justice o' Peace, and from thence turn'd a kind o' Sollicitor at <hi>Goldsmiths<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall</hi>; h'as a pretty Smattering too in Poetry, and would ha' been my Lady Protectres's Poet; He writ once a Copy in praise of her Beauty, but her Highness gave him for it but an old Half-crown piece in Gold, which she had hoorded up before these troubles, and that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd him from any further Applications to the Court. Since that, h'as been a little Agitator for the Cavalier party, and drew in one of the 'Prentices that were hang'd lately; He's a good ingenious fellow, that's the truth on't, and a pleasant Droll when h'as got a cup o' Wine in his pate, which your Uncle and I supply him with; but for matters that concern the King neither of us trust him. Not that I can say h'as betraid any body, but he's so indigent a Varlet, that I'm afraid he would sell his Soul to <hi>Oliver</hi> for a Noble. But Madam, what a pox should we talk any more o' that Mole-catcher? (Now I'm out again— I am so us'd onely to ranting Whores,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64428:13"/>
that an honest Gentlewoman puts me to a Non-plus!)</p>

                     <p>You know your Uncle's Drolling humor, Madam; he thought there was no danger in the Raillerie, and that you'd quickly find out what he was; Here he comes again,
<stage>Enter Worm.</stage>
I'le leave him with you, Madam, for a Minute, and wait upon you immediately, (I am at a loss, and must recover my self) Captain, I ha' dealt better by you than you deserv'd, and given you a high Character to her; see you do me right too, if there be occasion— I'l make bold though to hearken whether you do or no.</p>

                     <l>I See 'tis no small part of policy</l>
                     <l>To keep some little Spies in an Enemies quarters:</l>
                     <l>The Parliament had reason—</l>
                     <p>I would not for five hundred pounds but ha' corrupted my Cousin <hi>Lucia</hi>'s Maid; and yet it costs me nothing but Sack-possets, and Wine, and Sugar when her Mistris is a bed, and tawd'ry Ribbonds, or fine Trimm'd Gloves sometimes, and once I think a pair of Counterfeit Rubie Pendants
That cost me half a Crown. The poor Wench loves Dy'd Glass like any Indian, for a Diamond Bob I'd have her Maden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head if I were a Man and she a Maid. If her Mistris did but talk in her sleep sometimes o' my conscience she'd sit up all night and watch her, onely to tell me in the morning what she said; 'Tis the prettiest diligent Wretch in her Calling, now she has undertaken't.</p>
                     <lg>
                        <l>Her intelligence just now was very good, and</l>
                        <l>May be o' consequence; That young <hi>Truman</hi> is</l>

                     <p>These are your grave Maids that study Romances, and will be all <hi>Mandanas</hi> and <hi>Cassandras,</hi> and never spit but by the Rules of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor; Oh, here she comes, I hope, with fresh intelligence from the Foes Rendevouz.</p>

                     <p>Why (hee, hei, ha!) My Mistris sits by her Servant in a long Veil that covers her from Top to Toe, and says not one word to him, because of the Oath you know that the old man forc'd his son to take after your Father had forbid him the house, and he talks half an hour, like an Ass as he is, all alone, and looks upon her hand all the while, and kisses it, But that which makes me die with laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the conceit (ha, ha, ha!) is, that when he asks her any thing, she goes to the Table, and writes her answer, you never saw such an innocent Puppet-play!</p>
