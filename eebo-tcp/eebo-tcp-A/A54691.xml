            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Some Reasons of many more which might
be offered against the pretended
Registring Reformation.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T cannot be denyed by any who have
conversed with the right Reason of
Laws, and Rules of Government, That
Innovations are more than a little dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
because there cannot possibly
or probably be at once a certain and clear prospect
made of all the evils, contingencies, and unevitable
consequences which either will or may happen by it:
And therefore have adjudged it to be more conducing
to the Weal-publick, rather to suffer some few or sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
mischiefs not fatal, than many Inconveniences.
Which will not be escaped in such a Renverse or
Plowing up of all or the greatest part of the Estates
and Credit of the Kingdom, and the product of so
many sad effects as will attend it; And may not be
thought to be either a Probleme or Paradox in a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
harrowed and torn by War and Confusions:
If it shall be considered,</p>
            <p>That at the end thereof all the Coyn which wore
the <hi>Harp</hi> and <hi>Cross,</hi> being a moiety if not more than
the legitimate money of King <hi>Philip,</hi> Queen <hi>Mary,</hi>
Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> King <hi>James,</hi> and King <hi>Charles</hi> the
<hi>Martyr</hi> amounted unto, did not with much of it which
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100064:3"/>
was counterfeited, when it was called into the Mint
by his now Majesty, exceed Two Millions Sterling
and an half; and that too much of that money, and
other afterwards Coyned, hath been transported,
melted down into Plate, or fooled away by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
of our Gold and Silver, to adorn those that
should not wear it; and that the people of <hi>England</hi>
for above 18. years Civil Wars, Plunderings, Seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations,
and Free-quarter of Armies and Souldiers,
and above 20. years very great and various Taxes, are
so universally indebted, as it may rationally be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
that the most part of them live more upon
Credit, than any certain or real Estate or Subsistence
of their own; that much of the Lands of <hi>England</hi> if it
should be sold, will scarcely pay the Debts which
might be charged upon the Owners thereof; and
that a great part of the City of <hi>London</hi> now so stately
Re-built, hath been brought to that perfection by
Credit and Money borrowed, which would not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
have been effected.</p>
            <p>That our Nobility and Gentry, the most of which
made their Loyalty to their King, and their love to
the Religion, Laws and Liberties of the Kingdom, to
be their ruine and impoverishment, will now by such
a Registration be turned out of that Credit which was
left to support their feeble and languishing Estates.</p>
            <p>That our Merchants, whose Trades have brought
Riches and Plenty into their Habitations, and to be
Inmates and dwell with them, are for the most part
three parts in four in Credit, and an opinion of a
greater Estate than they can justly call their own.</p>
            <p>And the Retailers, and now more than formerly
lofty Shop-keepers, who have owed their low begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
to a small Stock, and a great deal of Credit, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100064:3"/>
gain so well by it as to afford to give 15 <hi>per Cent.</hi> to
any that will adventure a joynt Trade with them, will
when they shall be exposed to the jealous eyes of the
nice, over-timerous and suspicious Usurers or Money-lenders,
be turned out of all their expectations, and
made to submit to the devouring and unmercifull
Fangs of a Statute of Bankrupt, or give over their
Trade and be better acquainted with humility.</p>
            <p>The Country Farmers when Corn or Cattel shall in
their rates or prices fall short of their hopes to pay
their Land-lords Rents, shall not now be able to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
money to pay them, if their small Stock or Estates
shall not be sufficient to endure the severity of a Tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tale
Registration.</p>
            <p>All Trust and Credit, and the Faith, Charity and
Love of Mankind one to another, whereby so many
Families have had their rise and foundation, and more
have gained good imployments, will be so enervated
and weakned, as men shall be affraid of that which they
needed not to have troubled themselves withall, and
make them to be like crafty <hi>Banyans,</hi> and hard hearted
<hi>Jews</hi> each to other.</p>
            <p>The Merchants whose care of keeping their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dits,
returning Moneys, and answeriug Bills of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,
makes them dread a protest of Non-payment
like some Plague or mortal sickness, and whose
punctual performances makes every day but Sundayes
in every year many a score if not hundreds of Bargains,
for great sums of money and concernments, without
any Writing, Escript or Scrole, as the vulgar call it,
will now have such an Anatomy-Lecture read upon
their growing more than certain Estates, as all men
will not easily or without much search have any thing
to do with them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:100064:4"/>
All Foreign Merchants will be by such a Registra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
affrighted and deterred from trafficking with our
Merchants without ready money, the want whereof
hath already by the cunning of the Banks beyond
the Sea, who are made to rise and fall according to the
scarcity or plenty of money, put them under great
disadvantages in the buying or selling of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> and other Nations whose low Interest
heretofore brought into <hi>England</hi> some Millions of
Sterling money, to put to a more gainfull Usury, will
by such a Registration not adventure to bring over any
more.</p>
            <p>Foreign Princes which are or may be in Hostility
with us, may by such a means or direction discover
the weaknesse of the Nation, in their want of money
either to offend others or defend themselves.</p>
            <p>Such a Contrivance will lay open and discover the
beggery and wents of the People, be inconsistent with
the humanity and mercy of the God of mercy and
Justice, who commanded us not to afflict, bite or
devour one another, nor to go into any mans house
to fetch a Pledge (whereby to disgrace him) and will
as little agree with our <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and the <hi>Salvo
Contenemento</hi> of the Gentleman, <hi>Waynagio</hi> of the
Country-man, or <hi>Mercandisa</hi> of the Merchant, or
the mercy and pity of our Laws in extending but a
moiety of Lands upon a Judgement, and sparing as
long as possible the Oxen and Horses of the plow.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Romans</hi> when their people mutined, and
refused to go to War in regard of the oppression of Usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
did not offer them such an ill compounded remedy
as the intended Registration, to publish and lay open
their poverty and thereby adde to their misery, but
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100064:4"/>
did order that no Creditor should take any Interest for
certain years then to come.</p>
            <p>Nor did the <hi>Scotch</hi> after their wars mingled with
their own and our factions had greatly impoverished
them, deeme it to be any good for their people to
have the fury of their Registrate Bonds, and Horning,
and Caption let loose upon them, but locked up those
severities and disgraces, by ordaining that no Annual
Rent or Interest, as they there call it, should for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Years after be demanded or taken.</p>
            <p>That such a device as the Registration will not only
undermine and overthrow a great part of our Laws,
and the excellent form and beauty of the fabrick and
structure thereof, in which the Liberties and safety of
the peoples Estates do reside, and lead into Captivity
their Laws and Liberties, but hinder and take away
from the King his post Fines, and profit of Alienations,
Green Wax, Fines upon Original Writs, and Seals in
his Courts of Justice and Chancery, amounting to about
Forty or Fifty Thousand pounds <hi>per Annum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lay open and expose every mans Estate to Taxes
and Assessements, when as the Registring of all Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages
and Alienations of Lands, can make no perfect
discovery of Incumbrances, without the Registring of
Judgements, Statutes and Recognisances, as well for
the time past as to come.</p>
            <p>Destroy or weaken the Trade of the City of <hi>London,</hi>
and divert the profit of above 15. or 16. adjacent
Counties, who have exceedingly improved their Rents
and Estates by it.</p>
            <p>That the Registrate moveable Bonds in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
had their original from the <hi>Caursini</hi> the Popes Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
in <hi>England,</hi> and from the miscalled <hi>Camera A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolica,</hi>
in the Reign of our King <hi>Henry</hi> the third,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100064:5"/>
banished from hence by the cryes of the oppressed
people; and that to take as they do Registrate
Bonds for Debts, and keep them dormant for 6. or 12.
months, or a greater time after, and afterwards Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
them, may so conceal Debts and Engagements, and
weaknesses of Estate, as may rather increase the haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
and damage of the lenders of money, than pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
it.</p>
            <p>That the Office of General Remembrancer of all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrances,
hath several Parliaments in the Reign of
King <hi>James</hi> troubled and attended them for a confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
and could never obteyn it, was refused and
certified by Sr. <hi>Edward Coke,</hi> and the Judges to whom
it was referred, to be against the Weal-publique, mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of its purpose in the Parliaments of King <hi>Charles</hi>
the <hi>Martyr,</hi> was entertained by <hi>Oliver,</hi> and his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
and mechanick party as a ready means to Level
and overturn our Laws, and make his Saints some
seats or business of Judicature in the several Counties,
but went do further than its <hi>Embrio,</hi> because his so
called Parliament could not agree in 6 Moneths time,
what should be called <hi>Incumbrances,</hi> and hath been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
in a late Session of this Parliament.</p>
            <p>And besides its ushering in of these and many other
mischiefs and inconveniencies, will be needless when
every man which doth but know any thing in our
Laws, or hath ever bought or sold Land, or sought to
recover any which hath been aliened from him, or had
Intailes which his carefull Ancestors thought to have
been an unalienable provision for him and his posterity,
docqued and cut off, cannot but confesse that our
Laws have from time to time been exceeding carefull,
and made it to have been a great part of their business
to secure and protect Purchasors <hi>Bona Fide,</hi> who are

the Pool of <hi>Bethesda,</hi> whither all men deceived by
Mortgages or fraudulent Conveyances do come for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
can if compared with the number of Fines and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries,
and Bargains and Sales that do pass in every
year, testifie that there is not much above one in every
thousand that falleth into such a misfortune; that in
these late times the rich and gaining party, by the suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and miseries of the loyal party, have not been afraid
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100064:6"/>
to have Joyntures setled upon their daughters given in
marriage with great Portions, to take Rent charges and
annuities for moneys lent by Chevisance, and for more
then the legal interest, or have bought indebted Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemens
estates, and gained well by monies left in their
hands to clear incumbrances, and many times accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the latitude of their consciences, compounded
them to their own no small advantage; and there is
commonly as much difference between Trade and
lending of mony, as betwixt a Trades man borrowing
of mony, and one that is no trades man lending it.</p>
            <p>When so many Commissions of Bankrupt issuing
out every year, and the crafty Trades men soddering up
themselves again by a composition, or three or four
shillings in the pound, can tell on which side the loss
and hazards do lye.</p>
            <p>And the grand increase of Trade appearing by the
Custome house books, and the overstocking of Trade,
by so great numbers applying themselves unto it, may
declare that there is no defect in our Laws which may
deserve such a scandal or needless reformation, which
will bring upon the people greater mischiefs or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies
then it pretends to prevent or avoid;
when the loss of money, by reason of the failings of
securities, or the insufficiency of Debtors, by the
pride and luxury of the times, so greatly gone beyond
that of former years or ages, will appear to be more
the cause of it then any the defects in our Laws, and
that the cry and clamour not unlikely to be designedly
raised concerning the loss of debts and increase of suits
and actions at Law is more than needs; when if it shall
as it may be evidenced upon search &amp; enquiry, that of
some thousands of writs and actions made out by our
Courts of Justice amongst such a multitude of people,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100064:7"/>
and their variety of affairs, that there are more then one
half of them ended in one Term or two, and a very
few of the remainder, unless for difficulty, or by reason
of the peevishness of some of the parties, do seldome
last to the years end; and that if all the Commissions
of Bankrupts taken out for seven yeares last past, and
the number of prisoners for debt which have layne a
year undischarged in the Prisons of the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi>
and the <hi>Fleet, Marshalsea,</hi> the two <hi>Compiers</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> and
all the County and other prisons in <hi>England,</hi> were taken,
it may give all unbyassed men cause and reason enough
to believe that there is no such danger or loss in lend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of money or getting it in again, or that it is the
cause of many suits or actions, when if there could be
any such fear of frauds, they may without such mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
and inconveniencies better be secured by a short
Act of Parliament, to ordain all intails, deeds of uses and
Mortgages to be inrolled in His Majesties high Court
of Chancery; and that whosoever shall fraudulently<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Mortgage any land, or wittingly conceal any former
Mortgage thereof, shall incurr the pains and penalties
ordained in case of <hi>Praemunire,</hi> or a forfeiture of the
double value to the party grieved.</p>
            <p>That Extremities will drive and necessitate men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to
seek releif and difficulties of Justice, or obtaining it
make a temptation of giving or taking bribes, now
put into a new disguise or Periwigg and called gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.</p>
            <p>That the bringing down of money to 6 <hi>per Cent.</hi>
hath as frequent Experiences may inform those
whose Estates have been sucked into a Consumption
by it, made too many refuse to lend money without as
much brocage as hath amounted unto 8 or 10 <hi>per Cent.</hi>
and taught them to prey and work upon mens necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100064:7"/>
by denying to lend money without Rent charges
or Annuities, which may bring them 12 or 14 <hi>per Cent.</hi>
and hath brought into a kind of trade and improvement
of mony that horrid usury and brocage now practised
by taking of pawns and loan of money at 60, 40, 30, or
25 <hi>per Cent.</hi> which like Locusts and Caterpillers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
every green thing, have almost covered this
impoverished Nation. And that the hardning of mens
hearts by such an inspection into all mens Estates, and
creating them by that means as many advantages as
they please, will when people cannot borrow moneys
as formerly upon reasonable securities cause an increase
of the Trade of <hi>Tally</hi> men, who do now gain a great
deal more than <hi>Cent. per Cent.</hi> by furnishing the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-women
and Heglers, and the Cryers in the Streets
and other necessitous people, with Clothes, Houshold-stuff,
or other necessaries, and lending them money at
12 <hi>d.</hi> a week for every 20 <hi>s.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the nature of the <hi>Scots,</hi> much differing from
that of the <hi>English,</hi> and the general poverty of that
Nation, causing the stricter tyes in their Bonds and
Obligations, and the grand severities used in them,
may be more agreeable to the Laws and Constitution
of that people, than the more rich and tender hearted
<hi>English.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Laws and Customs of <hi>Holland,</hi> and the
United Provinces, where they have few Gentry, little
Land, many Burgers, Towns and Corporations, and
where the Husband, Wife, Children and Servants do
continually busie themselves in Trade and Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize,
may better endure the Notarial Acts (not much
used amongst them) conveyed unto them by the
Civil Law, and the Registrings which the 200th.
penny paid to their <hi>States</hi> upon the sale of Houses
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100064:8"/>
doth in a manner necessitate, but cannot amongst a
people whose Trade and Stocks are ever busily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in their Herring-Busses, or are ever sending out
or taking in their personal Estates in Money or
Goods, to or from all the parts of the habitable
World, admit or give them so clear a Perspective as
our men of the Registring Reformation dream of;
and yet when they are best of all pleased with it,
they as well as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and other transma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine
Nations, are to confess that they have more
Appeals and Staires of Contention to climbe in many
of their Suits and Actions, than we have in <hi>England,</hi> and
are not without as many Actions and Suits propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably
to the small extent of their Dominions, and
their many little Judicatories.</p>
            <p>That those who alledge that our Laws are under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valued
and slighted in the parts beyond the Seas, and
believed to be defective, may well allow us to think
well of our own, and blame such opinions of Foreig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
who censure our Laws when they do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the Language they are written in; and when
our learned <hi>Fortescue,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Fortescue</hi> de landibus legum Angliae.</note> whose Exile in <hi>France</hi> in the
latter end of the Reign of our King <hi>Henry</hi> the 6th.
gave him the opportunity of comparing the excellency
of our Laws, very much since adorned with an addition
of many good Statutes and Acts of Parliament, and
the defects of the <hi>French,</hi> did write his Book in the
praise of ours, and the dispraise of theirs.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Decrets</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>ringing out of a Bell</hi>
in some parts of the United Provinces, for a confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Titles and quieting of future Claims, do not
operate so much or strongly as our Recoveries and
Fines, with Barres upon Non-claims, do with less noise
and disparagement.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:100064:8"/>
And that if it were fit or could be reasonable for the
people of <hi>England</hi> to experiment all those mischiefs and
inconveniences which may as certainly as sadly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to us, as it did to the well-wishing Daughters of the
aged <hi>Pelias,</hi> who destroyed him against their will, by
letting out his old blood in their hopes of new; yet the
Registring Reformers can never arrive to any other end
of their Proposals, than that of getting Offices and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
to ruine or perplex the people.</p>
            <p>When as that which they would undertake will
prove to be impossible and unpracticable, unless they
can foretell and ascertain the Lenders, that men who
are now indebted &amp; behind hand, will never be before
hand or rich, or that those that are rich will never be
poor, or have any misfortunes; or can assure any Money<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lender
that such a Lord of a Mannor will have no E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
or Lands fall unto him; or such or any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
Merchant, Trader, or Borrower, will have no Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy
given him, no Executorship or Heirship happen
unto him, or what losses or gains may happen by Trade
or Adventure by Sea or Land, what will be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
or loss of the next ensuing Harvest, how much
or how little a man that appears to be a Lender of
Money in their Registry; hath in trust for Orphans or
others, how much a Foreigner hath of his own Bank
or Money in <hi>England,</hi> when he puts out Money to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
for his Countrymen, what Leases of Lands have
been made upon great Fines taken and little Rent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
what Leases or Estates have or will be forfeited
by Treason, Rebellion, or otherwise; what Dower those
women may resort unto, whose Joyntures were made du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Marriage or Coverture; or what Elopements they
are guilty of; what Moneys are Insured by Policies of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,
or what Bills of Exchange have been accepted;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100064:9"/>
what disherison of Heirs apparent, Illegitimacies, intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
and wrongfull Entries, what Actions of <hi>Battery</hi>
and <hi>Scandal,</hi> and other Actions or Suits in Law or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
which may lessen or prejudice any mans Estate,
may happen; what <hi>Assumpsits,</hi> Promises or Engagements
have been made by word of mouth, (which may make
as many Obligations, Troubles and Tyes upon mens
Estates, as Bonds or Bills can do or did before such kind
of Writings were invented:) what <hi>Embargoes,</hi> or what
ruines by high-flying, gaming or gadding Wives, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal
Children, losses by Fire, War, Factors, or bad
Servants, Suretiship, or too much trusting, incurring of
Penal Laws and <hi>Praemunires,</hi> death of those for whose
lives they held Lands or Estate, or had any dependence
upon, sickness, decay of Trade, deceits or wrongs done
by others, vain and unnecessary expences, or follies,
may happen; when as many mens Actions past or to
come <hi>in facto,</hi> or <hi>fieri esse,</hi> or <hi>posse,</hi> which are not visible
before hand, or to be found in any Registry, may prove to
be no small <hi>Incumbrances</hi> to <hi>Money-lenders,</hi> with many
other dangers, contingencies and particulars, of which
the <hi>Registring Reformers</hi> will not be able to find such a
certainty as a Table of <hi>Tides</hi> will give us of the Tides or
High-water at <hi>London-bridge,</hi> but leave those that will
trust to their discoveries to as great a hazard to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
as those that trust to Mr. <hi>Wing</hi> Almanack for
Weather &amp; Eclipses, sold in this year and some years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by the Stationers as this years or a present Calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
when he hath been dead long before; or meet with
as good a <hi>Directory</hi> as Mr. <hi>VVilliam Lillies</hi> hit or miss
guessing Almanacks, made out of wild and random con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures,
which in a Multiplying-glass of fears and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies,
bestowed upon the people by the proposed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistry,
making a Mouse to seem as big as an Elephant,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100064:9"/>
or a <hi>Pigmee</hi> as formidable as a <hi>Goliah,</hi> will be sure to
unhinge, dislocate and disturbe most of the affairs of
the Nation.</p>
            <p>And that therefore in a business of so many dangers,
and concernements of so many mens Estates, there
being more need to erect <hi>Mont Pietes</hi> in every Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
now successfully practised in many parts beyond the
Seas, to relieve the people in their debts and oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
increased by an Unchristian-like Usury and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cage,
then to encourage such a design of Registring;
it may rationally be hoped that the Parliament of
<hi>England</hi> will do as the Nobility and Peers of <hi>England</hi>
did in a Parliament in the 20th. year of the Reign of
King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, when it was but proposed that
Children born out of Wedlock might be declared to
be Legitimate by the after marriage of the parents,
stoutly to resolve, <hi>Nolumus mutare Leges Angliae.</hi>
