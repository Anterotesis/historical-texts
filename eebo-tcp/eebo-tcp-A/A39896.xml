            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:38291:17"/>
chooſe, but doe unto whatſoever
proceedeth from him, all that good
which the nature of it is capable
of (whether by natural or ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
means) and his wiſedome
can readily contrive the meanes to
bring that to paſs, which his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
diſpoſeth him to doe, and
his omnipotency as eaſily acteth
what his other two attributes have
projected ſo that there wanting an
infinite capacity of the ſoule, and
without which ſhe muſt be eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
miſerable, it remaineth, that he
who gave that capacity, muſt alſo
afford the object, and aſſign means
how to compaſſe and gain it; all
which is out of the reach of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to diſcern; and therefore it
followeth of conſequence, that the
Author of nature muſt needs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
man with ſupernatural means,
if he be in a fit diſpoſition to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:38291:18"/>
them, which may bring him
to the ſupernatural end he was
created for.</p>
               <p>And of the ſupernatural gifts,
the firſt, and the ground and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of all the reſt is faith; for
whereas that we cannot by any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
meanes attain to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of any object that may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
us compleatly happy in the
next life; and yet ſuch knowledge
muſt be had, to the end we may
direct our actions to gain the frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that object: Therefore
there is no way left to compaſs this,
but by the inſtructions and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
of ſome Maſter, whoſe good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and knowledge we can no
wayes doubt of; by which two
perfections in him, we may be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,
that he neither can be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
himſelfe, nor will deceive us.
Now the Doctrine that ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:38291:18"/>
Maſter ſhall teach for ſuch an
end, we call faith: Now we muſt
determine that this Maſter muſt be
God and man, and that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of that doctrine we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
the inſtructer of the actions
we muſt perform, and the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
of the happineſſe we may hope
for, be God himſelfe; who only
knoweth of himſelfe what is ſaid
in matters of theſe natures, and
who only is neither liable to be
deceived, nor can deceive others,
as being the prime verity it ſelfe:
Therefore it was neceſſary Chriſt,
God and man, ſhould come into
the world to teach us what to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
and what to do, and preach
unto us by his example, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
be our Leader in the way that
he inſtructed us to take. And we
muſt determine, that thoſe unto
whom Chriſt did immediately
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:38291:19"/>
preach this faith, and unto whom
he gave Commiſſion to preach it
unto others, and ſpread it through
the world after he aſcendeth to
Heaven, ought to be believed as
firmly as he himſelfe: The reaſon
of this Aſſertion is, that their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
though delivered by ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary
mouths, yet it proceedeth
from the ſame fountain, which is
God himſelfe, the prime verity,
that cannot deceive nor be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
But all the difficulty herein,
is to know who had this immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
Commiſſion from Chriſt, and
by what ſeale ſhould we diſcern it
to have been no forged one: The
ſolution of this ariſeth out of the
ſame Argument, which proveth
that Chriſt himſelf was God, and
that doctrine he taught was true
and divine, which is the miracles
and wonders he did, exceeding the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:38291:19"/>
power of nature, which could not
be effected by any but by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe;
for he being truth it ſelfe,
cannot by any action immediatly
proceeding from him, witneſs and
confirm a falſhood. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
the Apoſtles doing ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
works and miracles, as
neither by nature nor by Art Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick
could be brought to paſs, that
muſt neceſſarily infer God himſelf
co operated with them, to juſtifie
what they ſaid. It is evident that
their doctrine (not their own,
but received from Chriſt) muſt be
true and divine: This Faith thus
taught by Chriſt, and propagated
by the Apoſtles, and neceſſary to
mankind to believe, dependeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecally
upon the teſtimony of
the Primitive Doctors, Fathers,
and Councels in church Catholike
and Apoſtolike, which is ordained
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:38291:20"/>
conſerve and deliver it from age to
age; and this cannot be but either
by the immediate preaching of
Chriſt, or elſe by the information
(either in writing, or by word of
mouth) of them that learned it from
him, and their delivering it over
to others, and ſo from hand to
hand: But from Chriſts own
mouth none could have it but thoſe
that lived in the age that he did;
therefore there remained no other
means to have it derived down to
after ages, then by this delivery o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
from hand to hand of Fathers
diſperſed throughout the world to
the whole congregation of ſons or
youngers; which proveth that the
Church Apoſtolike is the Conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of the whole doctrine of Faith
neceſſary for ſalvation, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
of the divine Writ dictated
by the holy Ghoſt, and written by
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:38291:20"/>
the Prophets, Evangeliſts, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
which we are alſo bound
to beleeve. Hence we may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce,
that into Chriſts Catholick
Church no falſe doctrine in any
age can be admitted or creep in;
that is to ſay, no falſe propoſition
whatſoever can ever be received
and embraced by the Catholique
Church as a propoſition of faith.
For whatſoever the Church belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
as a propoſition of faith, is
upon this ground, that Chriſt
taught it as ſuch unto the Church
he planted himſelf, and ſo left it
in truſt to be by it delivered over
to the next age: And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
why the preſent Church belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
any propoſition to be of faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
is becauſe the immediate prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Church of the age before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
it as ſuch; and ſo you may
derive it on from age to age, untill
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:38291:21"/>
you come to the Apoſtles and
Chriſt: For to have any falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of faith admitted into
the Church in any age, doth ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
that all they of that age muſt
unanimouſly conſpire to deceive
their children, telling them that
they were taught by their Fathers
to believe as of faith ſome propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which indeed was not; which
being impoſſible (as it will evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
appear to any prudent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that ſhall reaſonably ponder
the matter) that ſo many men
ſpread throughout the whole world,
ſo different in their particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts
and ends, aud of ſuch vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
diſpoſitions and natures, ſhould
all agree together in the forgery of
any preciſe lye, which is moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible;
though any one man may
be liable to be deceived, or out of
ſome indirect end may be induced
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:38291:21"/>
to deceive others: Whence I come
to ſay that faith dependeth on
theſe two propoſitions; Firſt, that
whatſoever God ſaid is true Next,
that God I ſaid this, whatſoever it
be that is delivered thus by the
generall practice of the Church.
And the primary original na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
appetence of mans ſoule, is
the love of truth, which it vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently
deſireth, and is alwayes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet
and ardent in the ſearch of
it upon what occaſion ſoever; and
this acquiſition of truth is that
which the ſoule in every action na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
aimeth at, and deteſteth
ſalſhood. Therefore, although a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
particular man, as Dr. <hi>Taylor,</hi>
may have his ſenſe or fantaſie ſo
depraved, as to take imperfect or
maimed impreſſions of outward
objects; or the powers of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
ſo weak, as to make a
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:38291:22"/>
prepoſterous and diſorderly colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

ſo miſguided by preoccupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of any affection or particular
end, as he may in himſelfe be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
and feed his ſoule with
falſhood in ſtead of truth; or elſe
that ſiniſter reſpects and intereſts,
or ſordid apprehenſions of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity
to himſelfe by the ſenſuall
paſſions tyrannizing over him, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

impoſſible that all mankinde, or
ſuch a vaſt multitude of men as

to mans nature, and that are
diſperſed through the world, ſo as

whereby they might infect
one another / nor can have finiſter
ends common all alike to them all
which ſhould invite them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire
together to forge a falſhood.
It is impoſſible, I ſay, that ſuch a
company of Saints and Doctors
ſhould ſo degenerate from their
own nature, which is to love truth,
as they ſhould invent a lye, and
that (in ſo important a matter as
faith is) they ſhould concur to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the world of men that ſhould
come after them in things of ſuch
nature, as their deceit muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
damn for all eternity both
themſelves and all them that ſhall
receive that lye from them; and
take it upon their credit. This ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral

               <p>Thus I conceive I have made
good the Aſſertion that hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
this diſcourſe; which is,
that Faith conſerved and practiſed
in the Catholick Church, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
by perpetual Succeſſion, is
moſt certain, and moſt infallible:
But all this is not enough, our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quifition

with a certitude depending

and mans obtaining beatitude, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

(which is faith) but alſo ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
aſſurance of the right way,
which we may with an humble
confidence expect and claim at
Gods divine hands: God therefore
hath given to his Church the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual

to confirm it in the true faith, and

prehendeth not only thoſe that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in that age when he preached,
but alſo all others that ever were

Chriſt ſhould ſo effectually imprint
his doctrine in their hearts whom

Before <hi>Adam</hi> was created or preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricated.
God from all eternity by
a conditional omniſcient know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
did foreſee all future contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent

certain purpoſes, that both <hi>Adam</hi>

of all things that were to be brought
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:38291:41"/>
to paſſe by Chriſt; for God was
pleas'd to manifeſt in Chriſt all his
power, wiſedome and glory; and
therefore ordain'd and decreed that
he ſhould be the origin, exemplar,

there has been not only in the real

decree of God a mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradependency
or Anthitheſis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt

borne in original ſin. Secondly,
It may be compar'd to the Viſion
Beatifical, which is true everlaſting
life, from which original ſin doth
avert and turn; fitly thus its cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
death, as S. <hi>Paul, Rom. 5. By
the death of one man many are dead,
and by the ſin of one man death
reign'd.</hi> Thus original ſin is truly
call'd death, for that it averted
from God true life. Thirdly, If
original ſin, conſidered as in order
to the ſoule of man, may be call'd
infirmity, whereas mans ſoule by
it is rendred weak and infirme,
hardly able to reſiſt illegal and
luſtful motions and deſires: This

a proneneſſe, or propenſion to

to godlineſſe, &amp;c. Finally,
original ſin conſidered according
to its proper ſenſe and meaning,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:38291:44"/>
hath two parts; the one, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ial
part, <hi>viz.</hi> Concupiſcence,
which is a kind of infirm and weak
quality; the other the formal part,
<hi>viz.</hi> the want or privation of ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
juſtice due to nature; as in
the actual ſin of wilfull murder two
things may be conſidered: a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
thing in the ſoule, <hi>viz.</hi> a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
deliberate act conſented to by
the will, as is <hi>velle occidere;</hi> this is
intrinſecal, and is <hi>quid materiale,</hi>
but the formal part is the privation
or want of the righteouſneſs which
ought to be in that act, which if
had been in it, the act could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be a ſin: So in original ſin is
included both the guilt of ſin and
of puniſhment; the guilt of ſin,
becauſe its a privation of original
juſtice, a deformity, curuity, or
obliquity in the ſoule; the guilt of
puniſhment, which in Infants is
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:38291:45"/>
term'd concupiſcibility, and in the
adults actual concupiſcence: Hence
we infer that original ſin properly
doth conſiſt in the privation of ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
juſtice due to humane nature
received and loſt in <hi>Adam;</hi> for ſin'
properly is injuſtice, and injuſtice
nothing but the privation of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice:
Here we may conſider, that
of things ſome are poſitive, others
privative; the poſitive are all reall
ſubſtances, together with their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
and paſſions, powers and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
imprinted by the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in their nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the privative,
are thoſe that doth grant and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſe
the abſence of ſome ſuch
reall entity as ought to be in the
thing; and ſuch is ſin, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly
is no exiſting, or real
thing, or entity, but rather the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of ſome ſuch ſubſtance which
ought to be in the creature; and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:38291:45"/>
although it be inherent in poſitive
things as a meer privation, yet it
alwayes ought to be really diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
from them; ſo as that ſin
is no other then the very want,
loſſe or privation of that good
which God ingraff'd in the nature
of his creature. For example:
Original ſin tranſmitted to <hi>Adams</hi>
poſterity, is but the privation or
want of original juſtice and grace
ingraffed in <hi>Adams</hi> nature, to be
conveyed to his children; <hi>Si A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam

               <p>ORiginal Sin is attributed to
<hi>Adams</hi> poſterity, as relating to
nature, &amp; common to all mankind,
not to any ſingular perſon; for

nay all men, as they are rational,
they differ not one from another,

which nature is together with ſin

for even as the hand that commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

a murther (as is already ſaid)

having received his nature from
him that depraved and voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

voluntarily become culpable,
in juſt, and a ſinner; ſo as that the
original inordination, or natural
ſin in every natural perſon, is not
voluntary by the will of that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular

the firſt man, who as the firſt ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
moved, communicated, and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:38291:48"/>
conveyed by way of generation,
nature so infected and vitiated to
poſterity. For example: <hi>Adam,</hi>
after the loſſe of original righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
begat children, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
after he felt and had a
rebellion in his fleſh againſt his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and an inordinate motion in
his members, and ſo the act of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
in him became mixt with
luſt and concupiſcence; and this
ever ſince the loſſe of original righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe,
by which he was to be
ruled: And for this reaſon nature
traduced or conveyed from him, is
ſtill found with ſin and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and if you look for the
narrow way, through which ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
ſin is conveyed, it is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
ſleſh tranſmitted by concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence,

without any ſtain, is macula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:

As if the Saint had ſaid, Look for
no other conveyance or cauſe but
<hi>Adams</hi> ſin, and the natural propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of his infected fleſh, which
by a moral efficiency corrupted and
ſtain'd the ſoule; neither this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation
can abſolutely be the
cauſe, whereas this would have been
in the ſtate of innocency; but its
luſt, yet not luſt abſolutely, but the
inordinate ardor of luſt; ſo that
the ſoule contracts original ſin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the ſame is produced in the
corrupt fleſh, not Phyſically, but
only Morally, by natural propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Original ſin is no ſtain or ſpot in
the fleſh, neither a privation of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſuch quality in the ſame, by
which it ſhould become ſubject or

rebellious to the ſpirit, or the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

faculties to the ſuperiour:
This is manifeſt, becauſe ſin is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice;
but the fleſh is incapable
of juſtice or in juſtice; neither is
original ſin eſſentially concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
whether it be taken for the
natural inclination to evil, or for
the voluntary or involuntary mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of concupiſcence, becauſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual
concupiſcence is a ſenſitive
appetite which is n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tural to man,
and therefore no ſin; neither can
it be the inclination of the will,
for that is natural, and a real po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive
entity; neither is it a privation
of any natural rectitude, but of a
ſupernatural; neither is it only pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
of ſin, but hath in it the
nature of ſin eſſentially and formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
and is called the ſin of nature,
becauſe its derived by natural or
ſeminal generation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:38291:50"/>
It's therefore moſt certain, that
original ſin is no vitious habit, no
proneſſe or concupiſcence of the
fleſh, neither any infectious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe,
poſitive ſtain, or ruſt in mans
ſoule, but it is a privation of ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
juſtice which ought to be in
our nature, as due to it, becauſe
received and loſt in our firſt Father
<hi>Adam:</hi> But concupiſcence, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Saints held to be original ſin,
may be two way<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s conſidered; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as it is an act, habit, or a prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in the ſenſitive appetite, and
neither of theſe is formally a
ſin; for ſin is never in the ſenſitive
part; or elſe this concupiſcence is
the proneſſe in the rational appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite,
<hi>viz.</hi> the will, exciting to the
deſire of things pleaſing, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderately
convenient to the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive
appetite to which it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned:
And thus concupiſcence
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:38291:50"/>
conſidered is the material part in
original ſin, becauſe the will,
through the want of original ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
is left prone to rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
reaſon.</p>
               <p>That original ſin is formally the
want of original juſtice, is thus
prov'd: Every ſin formally is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtice;
<hi>Ergo</hi> every ſin is the privati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of ſome juſtice or righteouſneſs
due, but the righteouſneſs due to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,
is not actual but original: <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go</hi>
original ſin is formally the want
of original righteouſneſſe due to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
individual.</p>
               <p>Further, Even as actual ſin is the
want or loſſe of the righteouſneſſe
and rectitude which ought to be in
the conſented act of the will; even ſo
original ſin is the privation of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal
juſtice and rectitude which
ought to be in uature, which recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
is original righteouſneſſe; for
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:38291:51"/>
as every act hath naturally annexed
to it a proper rectitude, ſo humane
nature was created by God with
its proper natural and ſupernatural
rectitude; whereas original juſtice
as a ſpecial gift beſtowed by God,
not only on <hi>Adam,</hi> but alſo on all
his relative deſcendants, was a kind
of rectitude and juſtice due and
belonging to nature, ſo as the loſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
privation, or want thereof, became
a vice or ſin in nature; and thus
the want of it is the want of due
juſtice or righteouſneſſe, but the
privation or want of it is a ſin, not
actual, becauſe its not loſt by any
proper conſented act of the will,
but rather it is ſin original that is
contracted and derived to us day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
through the actual diſobedience
of <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Further, I ſay that by original
Juſtice man was made acceptable
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:38291:51"/>
and gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eful to God; therefore by
the loſſe or privation of original
juſtice, man is out of Gods favour
and grac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; and for this reaſon ſin
is counted the death of the ſoule,
as grace is the life of it; for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
habitual grace, which is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
to original juſtice, none
can become grateful to God, nor
be capable of any title to Heaven:
Whence we may infer children to
be in God Almighties debt for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal
righteouſneſſe; for they all
have received it in <hi>Adam</hi> from
God, who giving the ſame to him
by his antecedent will, gave it
likewi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e to all his poſterity; though
it was not given by a conſequent
will, <hi>quia Adam poſuit demeritum;</hi>
which is the reaſon why God doth
juſtly exact the ſame of us, and ſo
we become in his debt in juſt and
formally ſinners: In this all the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:38291:52"/>
Ancient Doctors doe agree.</p>
               <p>And although original ſin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
to poſterity, cannot without
ſpecial revelation be proved or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
by any natural ratiotinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
(for how can it by humane diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe

alſo?) which without the
light of faith, and the beliefe of
what is ſaid, cannot be apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
yet we may find out for the
explicating of original ſin, ſome
congruent Theological reaſons:
The firſt is, that ever in Gods
Church, from its very beginning,
there has been not only in the law
of nature, but alſo in the old and
new, a ſpecial remedy, inſtituted
for the cleanſing of original ſin
from Infants; ſo its moſt manifeſt,
that the Church held and taught
that Infants doe contract original
ſin; for if they had not in them
original <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n to be waſh'd away by
Circumciſion or Baptiſm, then the
form of Circumciſion and Baptiſm
in them would prove falſe; but
the conſequent is abſurd and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical,

the thing he undertakes to ſhew,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:38291:61"/>
as the ingenious Reader ſhall
clearly perceive; and that all his

broken ends of Sentences, ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no Argument, as indeed he
cannot, upon thoſe paſſages for

his opinion. The Doctor ſeems ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ambitious to be accounted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to reade a piece of the Fathers
Writings, then able to underſtand
them; he cited the Fathers moſt
impertinently and imperfectly;
endeavouring to make his owne
face and impure Doctrine clean, by
throwing dirt in great Saints fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
He did not like an honourable
Gueſt expect a meal from them,
but like a beggar, their ſcraps aad
fragments onely. I refer the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to <hi>fol</hi> 483. in his Explication

S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſor him: <hi>eſt &amp; alia mors

in hell, which is called
the ſecond death, which we ſuffer
not for <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin: this teſtimony
of S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> is plain againſt the
Doctor, for why doth he leave out
that which goeth before, and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:38291:64"/>
which followeth? for the illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated

Objection 2. S. <hi>Auguſt lib. 16. de
Civit. dei c.</hi> 18. ſaith, we are not
properly but originally onely born
ſinners: I anſwer, that S. <hi>Auguſt.</hi>
is to be underſtood ſo as that we
are not born ſinners by a conſented
act of our will properly, but by
the ſinful act of <hi>Adam</hi>'s inobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
which had a moral influence
on all mankinde to bring on them
the guilt of ſin.</p>
               <p>Objection 3. Until the Law ſin
was in the world, but ſin is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
where there is no Law; yet
death reigned from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi>
even over them that have not
ſinned after the ſimilitude of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>'s
actual tranſgreſſion, who is
the figure of the Meſſias: This
place is ignorantly interpreted by
our Doctor thus. Death reigned
upon them whoſe ſins therefore
would not be ſo imputed as <hi>Adam</hi>'s
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:38291:71"/>
ſin was, becauſe there was no Law
with an expreſſe threatning given
to them as it was to <hi>Adam. I</hi>
anſwer, the ſame Law that was
given with expreſſe threatning to
<hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe, was likewiſe
by interpretation given in him to
all his poſterity; and becauſe <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
tranſgreſſed that Law, all his
poſterity with him have tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed;
according to thoſe words
of S. <hi>Paul, In quo omnes peccaverunt:</hi>
Hence our Doctor's miſtake is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
in not indeavouring to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
how that the ſame Law
that was given to <hi>Adam</hi> did extend
it ſelf to his relative deſcendants,
and that not only temporal, but
alſo eternal death was threatned
both to him and his poſterity.</p>
               <p>Objection 4. Taken out of thoſe
words of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> By <hi>one mans diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience
many were made ſinners,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:38291:72"/>
&amp;c.</hi> Whence the Dr. <hi>Tayler</hi> doth
ſtrive to prove that if <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin
were imputed to his poſterity as
a guilt of an inherent ſin, then it
ſhould extend to all his poſterity
but out of this place it doth onely
extend to many, not to all: <hi>Erg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                  </hi>
not Original ſin, but temporal
death is abſolutely derived. I
anſwer, that the B. Apoſtle doth
uſe both words, <hi>many, and all;</hi>
whereas in the preceding Chapter
he expreſly averred that <hi>Adam</hi>'s
ſin, and Chriſts righteouſneſſe was
derived and conveyed to all <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>'s
poſterity; and in this <hi>verſe</hi> 19.
he avers that only many were made
ſinners by <hi>Adam</hi>'s inobedience;
and that by Chriſts righteouſneſs
many alſo are maderighteous. Now
I ask who be thoſe that are born
ſinners from <hi>Adam?</hi> and who be
thoſe that are regenerated in
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:38291:72"/>
Chriſt through baptiſme? theſe
are underſtood to be both all and
many. They were not all abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
becauſe Chriſt and <hi>Evae</hi>
were not made ſinners by <hi>Adam,</hi>
neither Infidels are by Chriſt juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied;
but thoſe onely that are in
Chriſt regenerated, and thoſe only
that are borne by ſeminal gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
from <hi>Adam,</hi> are here meant
by the B. Apoſtle: After this manner
we may underſtand thoſe words in
<hi>Gen. 17. Patrem multarum gentium
conſtitui te, &amp; in ſemine tuo bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicentur
omnes gentes, c.</hi> 22. Where
it's moſt manifeſt, that thoſe who
are promiſed to <hi>Abraham</hi> as chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
are counted in one place <hi>many,</hi>
and <hi>all,</hi> in an other; becauſe they
all are in ſome ſenſe underſtood,
yet not abſolutely all, if conſidered
in order to all humane kinde.</p>

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:38291:73"/>
The childe ſhall not beare the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

oppoſed another place in <hi>Exod,</hi> the
20. <hi>I am a zealous God, viſiting the
iniquity of the fathers upon the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
&amp;c.</hi> I thus reconcile both theſe
places in anſwer to the Objection:
that temporal puniſhment, as the

infamy, and ſuch like; chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
as being <hi>ſecundum corpus pars

for the ſins of their parents: but
eternal puniſhment of the guilt of
ſin, and an excluſion from Heaven,
is onely inflicted on them that are

ſin, if the childe become not parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:38291:73"/>
of his fathers ſin; as when the
childe imitates his fathers ſin, or
when the ſon's will and conſent
be implicitely involved in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
will: as it was with <hi>Adam,</hi>
in whoſe will all the wills of all
his poſterity are ever by interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
and by Gods ſecret decree
involved.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>Object.</hi> From S. <hi>Auguſt.</hi> and
S. <hi>Fulgent.</hi> who averreth that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants

of hell fire: I anſwer, that there
is an infernal place where in never
ending flames the damned ſoules
are eternally puniſhed in their
ſenſes; and the holy fathers are of
opinion that though unbaptized
Infants are in this infernal place,
yet are not tormented or puniſhed
at all by that fire as the wicked
are.</p>
               <p>7. <hi>Object.</hi> It ſeems horrid to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute

to the goodneſſe and juſtice
of God to be Author of ſo great
calamity to innocents as to be
damned even to the eternal loſſe
of the ſight of Gods glorious face,
for this cannot be inflicted upon
Infants becauſe they are not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of a Law when they had no
life, no conſent, no act of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
nor of will, &amp;c. which
argument, what ſenſe, what piety or

Gods mercy and goodneſſe is

is their being ſo deprived to be
aſcribed accordingly either to

to trike up anew the great

you (Noble Reader) whether all
this well conſidered, you ought not
to abhor theſe petty and odiouſly
proud undertakers, who ſeem to
come to the world to preſcribe
rules of faith in it, and believe and
teach what pleaſeth them and the

an inevitable malediction is tyed

it was to the end that (God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting)

by ſects, diviſions, and ſubdiviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that thoſe that are come to

hath ſtrong and ſtedfaſt footing,

that the reformation began with

for that the reformation began

in any religion or ſect what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever?
that Laicks have power
to adminiſter Sacraments, Preach,
interpret Scripture, and what not?
and that Original ſin is ſo called
<hi>abuſive?</hi> that in the Sacrament of
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:38291:80"/>
baptiſm there is had but a figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
remiſſion of ſin? thus doth
our brave Doctor end the ſpecious
reformation. Thus you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
how he brings up the rear of
new denials of ſome part of the
ancient faith, which former refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
had not yet obtained the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent
boldneſſe to reject: Such
and no other be all reformations,
a dayly taking away, and nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
abolitions of the antient Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
without any poſitive inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
Was not I pray the neceſſity
of faith and merit of works taken
away by ſome, Feaſt-days, Lents,
and all faſting rejected by others;
Prieſt, his power and Maſs (which
were as ancient in <hi>England,</hi> and
generally throughout the whole
world, as Chriſtianity it ſelf) put
down by ſome, contrition and
Penance by others: Was not ſoon
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:38291:80"/>
after Sacrificing, Unction, Altars,
Vows, Pilgramage, chas'd away
by ſome; the Lords-prayer, the Ten
Commandements, cried down and
neglected by new Tub praters, and
by the unrelenting malice of hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
monſters: Thus by a gradual
proceedeng of infidelity and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy
of the whole fabrick of
Chriſtian Religion, there is not
left one ſtone upon another. Only
<hi>unum baptiſmae in remiſſionem pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum,</hi>
as the diſtinctive character
betwixt Chriſtian and Pagan left;
together with the reall preſence in
the Lords Supper maintained in
the 39. Article, are this day con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned
by Doctor <hi>Tayler,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to bare ſhades, figures, and
dreams; ſo perfecting the work by
degrees, leaves us but damnation:
Were all reformers before him ſent
from God with devine commiſſion
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:38291:81"/>
to inlighten the world? if they
were, why then did they not do
their work to the full? muſt an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
Taylor or Bungler, at the
end of a full age ſtep in to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh
it? yes ſure, now our <hi>Tayler</hi>
hath done the deed to the utmoſt
beyond all addition; now the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
conſiſting of the denial
of eſſential truths, and all practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
principles of Religion, is
brought to the <hi>non plus ultra,</hi> he
brings up the rear, having uſhered
and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed by the hand <hi>James Naylor</hi>
to Pillory, and with him many
thouſands into horrid blaſphemies
and atheiſm; neither doth his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety
ſtay here, but dares deny a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Scripture ancient Fathers,
and the general received practiſe
of all ages; the neceſſity and reality
of Chriſt's body in the B. Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt.
For its a general rule approved
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:38291:81"/>
by all Divines, that we muſt never
underſtand any place in Scripture
figuratively, unleſſe we be evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
compelled thereunto; but no
ſuch matter in theſe words, <hi>This is
my body;</hi> for our Saviour doth not
ſay this bread is my body, neither
can his words be ſo underſtood,
eſpecially ſeeing the word <hi>hoc, this,</hi>
is both in Greek and Latine Texts
of the Neuter Gender, &amp; the word
bread is of the Maſculine. And by
the figures of this moſt B. Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the Catholique doctrine
is thus proved: the figures ought
neceſſarily to be of a meaner digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
then the thing figured, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.
But if the Euchariſt were no more
then ſimple and natural bread, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying
Chriſts body, and not his
very body it ſelf, then ſhould the
figures thereof be no whit inferiour
in dignity to the B. Euchariſt it
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:38291:82"/>
ſelf, yea ſome figures ſhould be
more excellent then it, which is
moſt abſurd; for if we conſider a
Lamb and bread as they are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
things, no queſtion but the
Lamb is more excellent then bread,
if conſidered only as external ſigns;
for who ſeeth not that Chriſts
fleſh is far better ſignified by the
fleſh of a Lamb then by bread?
Chriſts death is better ſignified by
the death of a Lamb, then by
breaking of bread; Chriſts inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
meekneſſe, &amp;c. are better
ſignified by the property of the
fame, then by thoſe of bread. As
for the Manna it was made with
Angels hands; it rained down
from heaven; it had all kind of
taſte; in all which reſpect it was
far more excellent then bread: ſo
as that now Chriſtians would be
in a far more ſad and more pitious
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:38291:82"/>
condition then thoſe of the old
Law, if we had figuratively only
Chriſts body and blood, and not
really preſent in the B. Euchariſt;
and there is no colour in the world
why any ſhould admit Chriſts
words to be otherwiſe taken then
really and properly: for the four
Evangeliſts uſe them unanimouſly.
None of the ancient Fathers ever
underſtood them figuratively, but
expreſly reach that they are to be
underſtood properly, no place of
Scripture, no Article of faith, no
decree of Councel, no explication
of the Church compelleth us to
take them figuratively; therefore
we muſt needs take them real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with all the Saints and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
fathers: See the 28. Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and
the 94. of <hi>Ireland,</hi> eſtabliſhed in
<hi>Dublin</hi> in the year 1615. Where
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:38291:83"/>
the Proteſtants do teach, that in the
Euchariſt the body and blood of
Chriſt is not only ſignified and
offered, but alſo really, ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
and truly preſented, exhibited
and communicated, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
that the bread is not a bare
ſign ſignificative only, but alſo
exhibitive of Chriſts body: See
<hi>Vſher</hi>'s Sermon before the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
<hi>Page 16. Edit.</hi> 2. Sure had
Chriſts body been only figurative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
preſented, he would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
the doubt when he ſaw the
Jews offended at the reality (as
Hereticks be now a days) <hi>John</hi> 6.
and he would not have confirmed
and repeated his ſaying in <hi>terminis</hi>
with promiſe of a greater wonder,
<hi>John</hi> 6. 62.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lutherans</hi> believe our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
to be as really in the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt
as he was upon the Croſſe, but
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:38291:83"/>
do not adore him; the <hi>Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques</hi>
both believe the reality of
it, and adore it. For my part I
ſhould clearly hold with theſe; for
S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and all the four Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts
unanimouſly teach the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the reall preſence, and not
one ſingle place produceable, that
in direct terms calls the B. Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt
a ſign or figure of Chriſts body;
notwithſtanding the vain curſed
maintainers thereof admit no
proof as authentical, but the pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſo important controverſie they
fly to logical inferences and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical

their own bare reaſon the Judge,
and not the word of God; rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
by their new and private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations
this great Sacrament
inferiour in dignity, not only to
the Paſchal Lamb a type of Chriſt,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:38291:84"/>
but even to Manna which was but
a figure of this very myſtery. Surely
if we ſhall add to ſo many and ſo
evident Texts of S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ripture, the
conſtant judgement of the Fathers,
and the univerſal practiſe of the
whole Chriſtian world, for above
a thouſand years, we may ſafely
conclude the doctrine of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours
preſence in the B. Euchariſt
to be moſt probable and true, and
conſequently <hi>Roman</hi> Catholiques
in no wiſe accuſable of raſhneſs
or obſtinacy in believing a poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſo efficaciouſly recommended
to them, and conveyed from hand
to hand, therefore what can be
more dangerous and pernitious to
any Kingdom, then to quite abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
ſuch a dread Sacrament plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
invincible, which adorneth and
graceth the whole univerſe, fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
innocency, extirpats vice, and
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:38291:84"/>
by moſt evident ways demonſtrate
that a living God lieth under it,
and ſet up in its place a piece of
prophane bread which never yet
diſcovered more grace or force in
the Miniſters hand, then it brought
out of the Oven. As its evinced out
of Chriſts repeated words.</p>
            <p>By this ſo important digreſſion
we have the omnipotencie of God
againſt all weakneſſe, idle curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
ſophiſms and artificial falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of new wits, as a pledge ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
enough to evince and ſecure
the reality of Chriſt in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Altar, and believe
that under the Sacramental ſpecies
ſenſible and corruptible, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
ſubſiſted with a glorious
body which is called by S. <hi>Paul</hi>
ſpiritual body becauſe its dignified
with qualities and conditions of
ſpirit though it loſe not the eſſence
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:38291:85"/>
of a body, adoring therein with
all humility that which cannot be
ſufficiently comprehended, but by
expreſſe paſſages of Scripture, clear
deciſion of 40. Councels, the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of above 500. Authors, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
and holy; which ought to be
preferred to the chimeras, imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary

of any particular Lay-man; and
if plain Scripture-Texts, with the

expoſition be not ſufficient for
a man to reſt both his Science and
Conſcience upon, I know not
where he will find a reſting ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable

but never come to take
a right aim. It being the moſt pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
folly which can creep into
the brain of man to deſire wiſedom
contrary to the wiſedom of Saints;
my firm hope is that Doctor <hi>Taylor</hi>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:38291:85"/>
having with ſo much labour and
charges indeavoured to honour
Chriſt in a meer ſhadow, will now
in the name of God, turn his
tongue and pen to honour and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
him in his true real and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial
body, and receive thoſe
rules of Religion ever unalterable,
eternal, univerſal, and conſtant,
and not any longer to run with the
