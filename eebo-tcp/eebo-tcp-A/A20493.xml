            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Which experiment that it may bee made
without any the least error or mistaking, the
Instructions following are set downe in such
plainenesse, and so distinctly in the materials,
preparation, proportion, applycation, and all
other requisite particulers, as none (not too
carelesly negligent) can possibly erre.</p>
            <p>FIrst then, the Soyle being supposed to bee
such, as with the vsuall Husbandries of
Dunging, Marleing, Lyming, Foulding, &amp;c.
will returne in some good measure in his sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
a multiplyed Cropp of the Graine therein
sowed; you must give unto it the ordinary
Tillage, according to the Nature of the Sone,
and use of the Countrey.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:10250:5"/>Your Seed being <hi>Wheat, Rye, Barley,</hi> or of
what other sort soever, must be well chosen,
and cleansed from light Corne, and whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>else
mixture of any Damagefull thing, with
an abatement of the fourth part of the Seed,
you usually gave in your former courses of
Husbandry, and yet you shall (by the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of God) finde your Corne as thicke and
strong, as if you had given the whole propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Seed.</p>
            <p>Vpon every Bushell of <hi>Winchester</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
containing eight Gallons, being laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Table or Course sheete Bedwise, powre
(as on a Bed of Wooll) so much of Rape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seede
Oyle, as will well moysten the said
Seede, stirring and tossing the Corne so oyled
to and fro, untill it bee well moistned and
made fit to receiue and joyne it selfe with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
drie matterialls, which shal be added ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
in Flower or powders.</p>
            <p>A Bushell of seede will take about a quart
of Oyle.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:10250:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>Then take one Quart of the Flower of
Beanes, being first M<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>ulted. One quart of the
powder of Rapeseede Cakes after the Oy<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>e is
pressed out; One quart of burnt Lyme new
from the Kilne, quenched with Vrine, and
sifted; or so much of each of them in equall
parts, as may well cover and encompasse the
said Seede.</p>
            <p>The Flower and Powders aforesaid must
bee very well stirred and mingled together
one with another, which done, strow them
upon your Bushell of Oyled Corne, tumbling
and tossing them and the graine one with
another, or shaking them togeather upon
the saide course sheet, untill the Corne have
licked upp, and united it selfe with the
Flower and Powders, which will soone bee
done.</p>
            <p>Your Seede thus ordered, and (as it were)
clothed with the Flower and Powders a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid,
may presently bee sowed, or kept
unsowed, Ten, Fifteene, or Twenty dayes,
<pb facs="tcp:10250:6"/>
before it will growe, or take other harme,
as hath beene tryed.</p>
            <p>In, on after your sowing, if your ground be
poore, and you have plenty of the said drie
Materialls, you may strowe or throwe upon
one Acre of Ground about two Bushels more
or lesse of the said Flower and Powders, as
you conceive your Ground better or worse.</p>
            <p>This mixture aforesaid, imployed as here
described with the Seede, and upon the
Ground, will really alone performe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
without any further addition, as hath
beene often experienced.</p>
            <p>But that the Husbandman may bee fully
furnished with all such experimented helpes,
as tend to this end. And because, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
there may bee in some places want of
the said Materialls, or some of them; let him
further know, that in lieu of them (though
not so powerfull) may be used the materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls
following.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:10250:6"/>As in want of the Oyle, you may use so
much of the strongest Woort.</p>
            <p>In stead of the Flower of Beanes, so much
of the Flower of Barley Mault ground very
small; and for your Powder of Rape Oyle
Cakes, as much of the powder of Pigeons
dung dried and sifted, or of the powder of
Sheepes Turdles drie: or so much of your
Kilp Ashes, or Berillia, where it may bee had;
or so much of Pot Ashes; or where Woad is
set for dying of Wooll, so much of Woad past
drie and brought into Powder: these in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
proportions mingled all or some of
them, with all or some of the former first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
Flower and Powders, may be succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
used, either in the dressing of the Oyled
Seede, or in the strowing the ground sowed
therewith, as aforesaid. But the Sheepes Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
must be thus prepared.</p>
            <p>Take so much of the said Turdles as you
purpose to use, and lay them bedwise in such
a thickenesse, as being moistened lightly with
Vrine, it may gather a heate, and grow incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
<pb facs="tcp:10250:7"/>
to Putrefaction or Rottennesse; and so
let it rest, untill it become somewhat drie.
Then with a Rake, or some other fitting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument,
stirre and tosse your bedd well, and
being againe layd Bedwise, moysten it with
Vrine as before, and let it so rest untill it
grow againe drie: then stirre and tosse it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
and lay it as before Bedwise, and moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten
it with Vrine. So continuing from time
to time this course of moistning, drying, and
stirring the said Bedd, untill the Turdles bee
throughly putrifyed and rotten; so as they
fall into powder: then let them drie, and
take the powder for your use. The elder
and more rotten the Turdles bee, the more
effectually they worke.</p>
            <p>So much of the aforesaid Materialls as bee
necessary, are every where to be had, though
in some parts further of, and dearer then in
other.</p>
            <p>That which may seeme most difficult to
be got in some places, is the Rape Oyle and
Rape Cakes, which yet by the late disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb facs="tcp:10250:7"/>
of that Husbandry into most Shires, is
not hard to bee had. But if it be found any
where lacking, any wealthy Husbandman
may (hiring of a servant from some of the
Oyle Workes) Convert some of his Greene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sword
to that use, and so furnish himselfe,
and neighbours aboundantly, and cheape,
and to his owne very great profit; and in the
meane time, some other of the former Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients
may be used in stead thereof.</p>
            <p>And this may suffice for Direction.</p>
            <p>The skilfull Husbandman by what hath
beene said, will take occasion as experience
shall guide him, to fit and accommodate
things, as hee shall finde most behoofefull,
though now and then varying from what is
formerly prescribed.</p>
            <p>There bee sundrie other Materialls which
are knowne to be of great force in the fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulling
of Areable Grounds; and might bee
easily drawne to this imployment, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
the former Flowers, Ashes, and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
bee applyed. But because these are to
<pb facs="tcp:10250:8"/>
be had but in small proportions, and but in
fewe places, they are purposely omitted, as
not answering the vniversalitie of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</p>
            <p>There be other moystures to supply that
of Rape Oyle, or of the Woort, for moyste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Seede, and other Ashes and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
for cloathing the Seede, and strowing
upon the Ground, which prepared accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to Art, are upon no light prosumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
conceived as powerfull in fruitfulling
and inriching Areable Grounds, as the other
formerly named: But because as yet they
have not beene so farre, and fully experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented,
as to be offered as a certaintie, their
mention is now forborne; but shall (God
willing) upon some further tryalls, be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
for the publicke good.</p>
            <p>Although by that which hath before been
said by way of Direction in this new Course
of Manuring, the Husbandman cannot but
observe many benefits arising thereby, above
those growing by the ordinary Tillages vsed;
<pb facs="tcp:10250:8"/>
yet shall it not be amisse to say something in
particular of that also.</p>
            <p>In this way, the trouble of Foulding, the
labour of carrying great quantities of Dung,
Lyme, Marle, &amp;c. and the spreading thereof
is spared, and the fetching of some of them
divers myles, and at great prices; Whereas
the quantities of these Materialls used in this
way are so small, as will cost little, and so
light as the carriage will be easie, and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
them to the Seede and ground, askes
little more trouble then the very sowing of
the Seede it selfe.</p>
            <p>The Dunging, Foulding, Marling, Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
&amp;c. formerly bestowed upon the Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Grounds, may now be converted to the
fruitfulling of the Greenesword.</p>
            <p>A fourth part of your Seed is saved, which
will neere, if not wholly, countervaile the
charge of the Materialls.</p>
            <p>The Flowers, Ashes, and Powders encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing
<pb facs="tcp:10250:9"/>
the Seed, moistened as aforesaid, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth
it from the devouring of Fowle, Mise,
Wormes, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The poorer sort, who want Cattell to
breed, and money to buy Soyle, shall in this
course, with little or no charge supply that
want.</p>
            <p>In this husbandrie, you may Sow the same
Ground every yeare, and so spare the more to
Meadow and Pasture.</p>
            <p>Besides the generall good to the Common
wealth, it will better all Tythes of Graine,
to the benefit of Incumbents, and others to
whom the Tythes be due.</p>
            <p>A fewe yeares experience will (no doubt)
bring to light many other Commodities ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
by this invention, not now thought of,
but for the present these may serve.</p>
            <p>For Conclusion, when you have care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
and exactly followed the Directions
<pb facs="tcp:10250:9"/>
aforesaid, and (it may be) in some things bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
them, take heed you doe not so depend
upon these outward meanes, though never so
good, as to forget the Cause of Causes.</p>
