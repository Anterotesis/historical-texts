            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE cauſes why I make this Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion apart to Your Ladyſhip, are divers. The firſt is, that ſweete Lord (the lamented Subject of this Booke) in whoſe praiſe, my Muſe ending, will expire like a <hi>Phoenix</hi> in a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume.
<pb facs="tcp:18330:6"/>
Hee was extreamly oblig'd to Your Ladyſhip in particular; and therefore You deſerve parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular and infinite thankes from all of his Blood and Name, of which I am one, who have ever had your Vertues in admiration. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is, that You, Madam, are none of thoſe <hi>Romance</hi> Ladyes, who make Fiction and Folly their Study and Diſcourſe, and appeare wiſe onely to Fooles, and Fooles to the wiſe. By reading nothing elſe but Vanity, they become no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe themſelves. They make a more diligent enquiry after the deedes of Knights, and Ladies er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, than after the Acts of Chriſt and his Apoſtles. The loſſe of their time is their juſt puniſhment, in
<pb facs="tcp:18330:6"/>
that they ſpend a whole Life in reading much, and yet is that much, nothing. But you, Madam, are capable of the moſt profound grave Miſteries of Religion, and daily peruſe and meditate Bookes of Devotion. You deſpiſe the bold Adventures of thoſe Female Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and piouſly ſurveigh the lives of the Female Saints. You have render'd yourſelfe a moſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd Lady on Earth, by imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our bleſſed Lady which is in Heaven; who as ſhe was here the firſt Saint of the Militant <hi>Church,</hi> ſo is ſhe there, the firſt of the <hi>Church</hi> Triumphant; having learn't that ſhe ſpent al her houres in works of Charity, you trace her ſteps, knowing that Shee, and Vertue,
<pb facs="tcp:18330:7"/>
trod but one path. Hence it comes, that you are at no time ſo angry, as with the loſſe of an opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to ſuccour the diſtreſſed; and that you are as indefatigable in doing good as heaven in moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Hence it is, that the impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous force of a Torrent may bee as well ſtopped, as the conſtant flood of your goodneſſe; which never ſtayes till it have water'd, and relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved all within its Ken, commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable either for Knowledge, or Vertue. My third, and laſt ſcope in placing your Character in the Front of this Treatiſe is, that like a Starre it may ſtrike a luſtre throughout this Booke, and by its light chaſe away the darkneſſe Oblivion would elſe caſt upon it.
<pb facs="tcp:18330:7"/>
Queſtionleſſe it will breede a holy emulation in any of your Sexe, who ſhall here learne that there is a Lady, whoſe vertues are come to the Age of Conſiſtence, and can grow no further; and from whom, not only her poſterity, but her An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, alſo receive honour; They, in this reſembling the Morne, who though ſhe precedes the Sun, receives her ſplendour from him.

Oratour. And here I muſt crave pardon of the judicious Reader, if I draw not his perfections to the life. My Apologie may be a juſt complaint that my ſtile is fetter'd by the idle Cenſures of Schiſmaticall Fools, whoſe purblinde ſouls can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſcerne betweene a fawning Flattery and a due prayſe, who have hardly language good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make themſelves underſtood, much leſſe to perſwade others, except it be never to read them againe. I could without the aide of any Rhetoricke at all, pen one of their dimme foggy Lines, wherein there is nothing conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, that I would not reduce into a poeſie for a Ring, ſo that they might weare their own ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on what finger they pleaſe. But there are more then humane helps required to give a Heröe his true Character, whoſe magnanimous ſoule har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours not a thought ſmall enough to enter into their narrow, paſſive brains. As in the Ancient Sacrifices, it was not lawfull to kindle the Altars of the Gods with any materiall common Fire, but with the pure Rayes of the glorious Sun: So a divine flame is required to illuminate that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which undertakes to characteriſe the ſoules of great and eminent Men. I confeſſe, freely, the the wings of my invention flag, and are not able to beare her to the Summity of her towring ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. It is a received opinion, that Wit encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Griefe, and Griefe Wit.

And yet this is no wonder at all; for my beſt bloud being loſt in him, my worſer remayning muſt needs chill, and no man is ignorant, that where there is not <hi>Focus in Venis,</hi> there cannot be <hi>Subtilitas in Intellectu: When Warmth forſakes the Veines, Subtilty muſt of neceſſity abandon the Head.</hi> Yet were I maſter of as great an eloquence as <hi>Demoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henes</hi> himſelfe, my beſt words could not give his Vertues a clothing correſpondent to their luſtre.

As it is more eaſie to tell what is not in Heaven then what is: So it is by farre more facile to number the Vices which hee had not, then the Excellencies of which hee was the happy poſſeſſour. But becauſe in great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, even attempts are laudable, and that by many, this Teſtimony of my Duty is look'd for at my hands, I am content to take the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage though of a moſt unhappy, and unwelcome occaſion to ſeale up my former Affection, and publiſh to the World the damage I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived

The third are they whoſe Progenitors have been great Warriours, and Lawreated Triumphers. The fourth and beſt, are they who excell in Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimitie, and Greatneſſe of Merit. And truly I am of <hi>Plato's</hi> minde; for though I am a never yielding Advocate for men of remarkable Stocks, yet I believe not that Honour is confined to run in certain particular Channels, or that the Rationall Soule ſhould be bound to the ſame Lawes with the Vegetative, or Senſible. Where Nobility is onely <hi>Nuda Relatio, a meare bare Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> and nothing elſe I eſteeme it, not a Grace, but a Diſparagement.

Honour, not Fortune, who, though ſhee be a Queene, many times imitates unhappily ſome of her owne Ranke in ſuffering her ſelfe to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd by Groomes, and fixeth there her Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion where the World placeth its Deriſion.

At all Triumphs, and Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings it is proclaim'd, that hee who is not ſuch muſt not preſume to handle a Sword or Lance, or enter into the <hi>Liſts.</hi> Nay, it is moſt certaine, that at thoſe great Solemnities they have excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt ſome baſe ſonnes of their owne Kings defective in Bloud by the Mothers ſide, and would hardly be pacified by their Princes anſwer, which was, that what honour was want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Mothers ſide was ſuperabounding on the Fathers. In the Raigne of <hi>Fredericke</hi> the Second King of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> there lived a moſt learned Man named <hi>Eraſmus Laetus,</hi> who for his Science, and pleaſing Diſcourſe, was admitted into the beſt Companies, and had an eminent place at all Tables.

If in that Kingdome an ignoble man defloure a noble Maid, his head is infallibly cut off, and ſhee lives, and dies ſhut up betweene two Walls.

and never taken notice of afterward by any of her Kinred. In ſome places of <hi>Polanda</hi> a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hath this priviledge that if hee kill a Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, a Hind, or any other ordinary man by paying downe foure ſhillings he is quit.</p>
            <p>I abhorre this fooliſh ſtrictneſſe, and ſeverity, yet could wiſh we were not as careleſſe this way, as they were punctuall, our Tables then would not be ſo throng'd with Farme, and ſhop-Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.

reſorts to the Heart as the firſt liver, and the laſt dier, and the nobleſt part of the Body: ſo for the moſt part Perfections and Graces, as the Requiſites of Honour, make their repaire to the more Honourable of Mankinde. Abortion ſounds not ſo ſtrangely in our eares as degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, becauſe the former is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon, the later not. We not very often, ſee any man of a Noble ſtrain in whom we detect not ſome Impreſſion, ſome ſeeds of his Parents worth, which in time ſpring up, bud, and flouriſh in him.

            <p>If our Hodiernall Nobility would ſpend ſome <note place="margin">Arts &amp; Arms ſhould be the ſtudy of the more Noble.</note> time in this Meditation, and diligently exerciſe themſelves both in Letters, and Armes, their Honour would not be aſſail'd on all ſides by the Vulgar as at this day it is, and it would no longer appeare as in ſome it does, a meere ſhadow of a conſumed Body. The Emperour <hi>Adrian</hi> Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour both in the Empire, and Vertue to <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan,</hi> (equally an Enemy to Vice, and Sloth) uſed to ſay, that it was not decent to ſee a young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman without a Book in one hand to teach him Wiſdome, and a Sword in the other to defend the ſame againſt all <hi>Barbarians</hi> whatſoever. So amiable was the Conjunction of both theſe in his ſight, that he did never eat without two ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

by him of ſeverall Abilities, one to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to him of the ſecrets of Nature, the other of Stratagems of Warre. And that this was the Cuſtome of the other Emperours, appeares by the two Maſters of <hi>Nero, Burrhus,</hi> and <hi>Seneca,</hi> the one a Martialiſt, the other a Philoſopher. <hi>Charlemaine, Lewis</hi> the <hi>Debonaire,</hi> Saint <hi>Lewis</hi> and others had them in ſuch eſteeme, that they held the joyning of them together as neceſſary, as the linking of the Husband, and the Wife.</p>
            <p>The Politickes diſpute which of theſe two ſhould have the Precedencie, but in the end give it to the Gowne, in that Good Letters can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructus in the Military Diſcipline, but Armes cannot impart the Knowledge of the Arts.</p>
            <p>I may ſeeme to ſome to have dwelt too long on this weighty, and neceſſary Argument of Honour in Generall, whoſe pardon I crave, and ſo proceed in my Method to treate of his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie by Race, who is now my deplored Theam.</p>

To this worthy Teſtatour of their Greatneſſe, I ſhall yet adde a far greater: namely, the Right Honorable <hi>Henry</hi> Earle of <hi>Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> a Lord ſo omniſcient that he ſeem'd to all learned men living in his time, <hi>A walking A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.</hi> In a ſpeech of his contain'd in a Booke entituled, <hi>The Arraignment of the Traitours,</hi> his formall words are theſe. <hi>It was a Monke of</hi> Henton, <hi>that ſeduc'd the late Duke of</hi> Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, <hi>to the Ruine of as great a Name as any Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in</hi> Europe <hi>(excepting onely the Sirname of a King) can demonſtrate, by which I receive a ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh, and all thoſe that deſcend from him.</hi> This is enough for mee, in that I cannot blazon Coates, nor draw Pedigrees, and becauſe I am unwilling to diſparage ſome whoſe Names the <hi>Staffords</hi> bore in former times, and afterwards forſooke them as ſomwhat too obſcure, and low, for their lofty deeds.</p>

            <p>The firſt care of his Excellent Parents was to <note place="margin">His pious E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation.</note> let him know there was a God that made him, and they taught him by geſture to acknowledge this Truth, ere hee could by ſpeech. The erection of his eyes, and Hands ſpake for him ere his Tongue could. To learne the Arts, and Sciences requires a convenient Ripeneſſe of Age, but it fares not ſo with Religion which is to be ſuck'd in with the Mothers, or Nurſes Milke. A Veſſell <note place="margin">Religion is to be ſuckt in with the milke.</note> reteines long the ſent of that wherewith it is firſt ſeaſon'd, and therefore hee was taught to name, and know his Heavenly Father before his Earthly. When he came to have the uſe of ſpeech, hee was inſtructed every morning with an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble heart, and in a ſubmiſſive phraſe to crave the conduct, and ſafeguard of God for that Day, and in the ſame lowly Language to implore his Almighty protection for the enſuing Night. Then was hee carried into Gods ſacred Temple there to offer up prayers, and Vowes due to his Maker. True it is, that we not only ſee, but han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle God in his Creatures, but we no where ſpeak univocally, and unanimouſly to him, nor hee at all to us but in his Church.</p>
            <p>And that hee might judge of Religion and <note place="margin">His learned Education.</note> Goodneſſe aright, theſe his ſolicitous Parents gave him a learned Education: for though Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:18330:23"/>
be not the Adaequate Cauſe of Vertue, <note place="margin">Though lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning be not the Adaequate cauſe of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, it is the adjuvant.</note> (that being Aſſuefaction in Goodneſſe) yet that it is the Adjuvant, all men not Contentious will eaſily grant. Some there be (who affirme) that Vertue cannot be taught, becauſe though the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect may be informed of the true forme of Vertue, yet the Will by this Inſtruction cannot be made flexible. Experience proving to us that many profoundly Learned, are withall damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly Wicked. But this falls out by accident, when Science meets with a perverſe, and depraved Nature. If we conſider Learning in it ſelfe, wee ſhall finde that though it doe not neceſſarily engender Vertue, yet it moves, and enclines the Will to embrace it. To this alludes that of <hi>Ovid.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <l>—Didiciſſe fideliter Artes</l>

            </q>
            <p>There are many forcible, convincing Reaſons, why a learned man is more apt to follow Vertue then an unlearned. Amongſt many other I will onely produce four. The firſt is, that by ſtudying the Arts, and Sciences the thoughts of man are averted from dwelling on corporeall things, the ordinary objects of his Affections, and by that means the occaſions are cut off, that uſually allure him to be enamour'd on Vice. Secondly, he who is a curious ſearcher into the Nature, and cauſes of things, judgeth of them aright, and eſteemes them as they are. Hence it comes to paſſe, that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:18330:23"/>
he magnifies things truly great, and contemnes thoſe equally baſe, and is nothing at all moved with ſuch Events as in the Vulgar beget Terror, and Aſtoniſhment. Thirdly, through the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of things Naturall, and Supernaturall, hee diſcernes many cauſes why wee ſhould adhere to Vertue, and deteſt Vice: For hee who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands the Nature and Excellencie of God, will deſire to be like him, and hee who knows that God hath created all things under the Sunne for him, will be enflam'd with a divine love towards him, and approve himſelfe gratefull, and ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to this his Heavenly Benefactour. Likewiſe hee who eſpies in the bruite creatures themſelves Images of Vertues, in ſome that of Fortitude, in others that of Temperancie, and Chaſtitie, in all an Inſtinct, and Induſtry in undergoing thoſe Offices they are made for, and which are proper to them, will eaſily be induced to thinke it a ſhame, and diſhonour to him, if he (having the uſe of Reaſon, and having the ſtampe of the Deity upon him) ſhould be found defective in his Duty. Fourthly, and laſtly, Learning layes before us the true Forme of Vertue, and furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us with Examples of brave accompliſh'd men, with the rewards, and Glory they purchas'd by their Perfections: and on the contrary, the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious, and horrid ends of ſuch as have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v'd, and died mancipated to their owne ſordid, enormous Imperfections, the Meditation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of will render a knowing man an Admirer of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:18330:24"/>
Goodneſſe, and a loather of Wickedneſſe.</p>
            <p>They who are ſo obſtinate as to reject theſe Reaſons in favour of Good Letters, will ſurely be ore-borne, and have their Judgements recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and reform'd by the Authoritie of great Men, who have declared themſelves Fautours of Erudition. This Example of <hi>Alexander,</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting <note place="margin">Great men have declared themſelves fautors of Learning.</note> himſelfe to bee the Diſciple of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> ſhall bee the Leader. Before hee attempted the ſubduing of the World, hee deſired to know what the World was, and it is likely that the knowledge of it invited him to the conqueſt thereof. How he doted on <hi>Homers</hi> Works is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious even to Dablers in Story.

That incomparable Prince <hi>Alphonſus</hi> King of <hi>Spain, Sicily,</hi> and <hi>Naples, (Coetanian</hi> with <hi>Charles</hi> the Seventh of <hi>France)</hi> after he had once read in Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> that an illiterate King was no other then an Aſſe crowned, had igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in ſuch deteſtation, that where ever hee went, and at all times whether in Warre, or Peace, hee endevour'd both by Reading, and Conference, to better his Underſtanding, and at ſo high a rate he valued Science that hee gave for his Creſt, <hi>A Book open.</hi> It was a frequent ſaying with him, <hi>That his dead Counſellours, his Books, were to him farre better then the living, ſince they</hi>

               <hi>without flattery, Feare, or baſhfulneſſe, preſented to him Truth naked without any diſguiſing Cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> I ingeniouſly confeſſe, I never reade that ſpeech of <hi>Solon,</hi> without infinite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, who lying on his Death-bed, &amp; over-hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſome of his learned Viſitants deſputing and deciding ſome ſubtile queſtion or other, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively liſtned to their Diſputation, which a ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by obſerving, demanded of him why he now ready to leave the world, ſhould give eare to their diſcourſe: to whom he made this anſwer, worthy to be treaſured up in all memories; <hi>Ut cum illud audiero moriar doctior. That when I have heard that poynt diſcuſs'd, I may dye the more learned. Ariſtippus</hi> being demanded by one, in what his ſonne ſhould bee better'd if he learnt the Arts, and Sciences; anſwer'd. <hi>Etſi nulla alia in re, nequit, certè vel in hoc, quod in Theatro non ſedebit lapis ſupra lapidem: If in nothing elſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>yet truely in this, that hee ſhall not ſit in the Theater one ſtone upon another.</hi> The ſame Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher often proteſted that hee had rather bee a Begger than a Foole, in that the former onely wants money, the latter humanity. <hi>Antiſthenes</hi> confounded the ſtudious, and the noble, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh'd his Scholars, that learning was the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Viaticum,</hi> that in ſtormes and ſhipwracke when all things elſe periſh'd, would boy up in ſpight of evill Fortune. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> was ſo great a ſtudent, that when he went to reſt, he uſed to hold in his hand a Ball of Braſſe over a
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:18330:25"/>
large Baſon of the ſame Mettall, that when hee ſlept, the noyſe of the Ball falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Baſon might awaken him. To one who asked him how the Learned differ'd from the ignorant, hee replyed, <hi>ut Viventes a Mortuis: As the Living from the Dead.</hi> Hee would often repeate this his owne ſpeech, <hi>That Learning was an Ornament in proſperity, in adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity a Refuge; and that Tutors were farre to bee preferr'd by Children, before Naturall Parents, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they received from the later the benefit of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving onely: but from the former the felicity of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving well, and bleſſedly.</hi> I dwell the longer on this poynt that it may ſerve as an Admonition to all parents, eſpecially the more Noble to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow on their Children a breeding anſwerable to their Birth. In elder times, a Sonne was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged in all duty of obeying, comforting, and relieving his parents in their Age, if he could prove that they had neglected to inſtruct him in his Youth. The Ancients held, that they who provided Lands, and ample poſſeſſions for their poſterity on whom to beſtow a learned Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they would would not be at the charge, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled a ſilly fellow, that hath more care of his ſhooes than his feete. They thought that the heaping up of Riches for a flat-witted Coxe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combe, who knowes not how to uſe them, was as if a faire ſweete Lute ſhould bee preſented to one who knowes not how to make it ſpeake harmoniouſly. They deemed ignorance to bee
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:18330:25"/>
at beſt but a dead Sepulcher, in which many were buried alive.</p>
            <p>Of the ſame minde were the tender parents of this ſweet young Lord, and therefore inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly exhorted him to be carefull rather of aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting his Knowledge than his Eſtate, whom he readily obeyed, his ambition &amp; their will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like two Lines that meete in one Center. The firſt ſhew of his inclination to vertue, was his love to Science, and her Favourites, which I may properly call the entry to that future Glory which vertue intended him, and Time deprived him of. Though he had Lands to till, he forgot not to manure his mind: Some by neceſſity are conſtrained to ſtudy hard, he by delight was invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his Book. He was none of thoſe who ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine all that time loſt which they loſe not, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting all thoſe Houres miſ-ſpent which they take from their pleaſures, &amp; give to their ſtudies. He would praiſe every man that aſpir'd to Knowledge, whether hee were his ſuperiour, his inferiour, or his equall in Learning. His Superiour had his beſt words as his due, becauſe he deſerved them. His equall he would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe, leſt he ſhould be thought to undervalue himſelfe; and his inferiour hee would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne or inſult over: for he held it no glory to excell the inglorious. The very deſire of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning he thought laudable in any man, much more the Acquiſition of it. It was an infallible Maxime with him, that except thoſe Eternall
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:18330:26"/>
Workes of the ſoule, wee can properly call no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ours, in that all other things wee leave behind us find other owners. He therefore la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd that by a barbarous Ignorance hee made not a forfeit of an Inheritance ſo ineſtimable as is a faire Fame, which was able to make all the ſurvivours of his name happy ſharers in that honour poſterity ſhall pay him. But what was the ſcope of his ſtudy? was it accutely to ſcold and wrangle, after the manner of the Times? No, his thoughts could not but bee at peace, whoſe ſpirit was compoſed of nothing but ſweetneſſe and mildneſſe. Was it to pry into the unrevealed Myſteries of the Deity? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſſe; for hee had found that many ſecrets in Nature, remaine yet unexplicable, much more then are thoſe of God inſcrutable, and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable by any humane eye. He had purus'd the Fable of the Poets, which tells us that <hi>Minerva</hi> ſtrooke <hi>Tyreſias</hi> blind, for beholding her naked. The Morall is full, and ſignificant, implying that the Deity muſt not be over-curiouſly ſearcht into. Was it for Vaine-glory, and to learne things more curious than profitable? No, he could not be proud of Knowledge, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that man was ignorant, and a ſtranger to himſelfe, till God reveal'd him to himſelfe. He learnt nothing being a Child, that would not prove advantagious to him being a Man. He hated ſuperfluous Science, and made choiſe of ſuch Authors onely as may inſtruct, not diſtract
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:18330:26"/>
his minde. He knew it fared with the ſoule as with the body, which is not nouriſh'd by the greedy devouring of much, but the good di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion of a little. He made, according to the Proverbe, no more haſte than good ſpeed, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that to come to the end of a long journey required not to runne a pace, but to be ever go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Was it language and words he onely hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted after? Neither of thoſe, for he loved the Kirnell farre better than the ſhell. If none of theſe, what then was the aime of his ſtudy? ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nothing but vertue, which hee knew to bee <hi>Res, non Verbum,</hi> as one ſayes, <hi>A Thing, not a Wordonely.</hi> And underſtanding that the Poets feigne her to have ſhort armes, inferring, that he who covets to be embrac'd by her, muſt make a neare approach to her before hee can come within her reach, and attaine to that ſupreame Happineſſe; he came ſo cloſe up to her, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers'd ſo frequently with her, that all his actions ever after ſavour'd of her ſweetneſſe. Her hee made his ſupporter, knowing that ingenious Antiquity repreſented her to us by a Hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick γ, whoſe toppe parts two wayes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles a Musket Reſt, to denote the aide and ſupport ſhee affords thoſe that put their truſt in her. And becauſe ſhe divides her ſelfe into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny branches, whereof ſome are divine, ſome morrall, he reſolved ſeriouſly, and intentively to practiſe, firſt the former then the later. The three Theologicall hee firſt choſe to exerciſe
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:18330:27"/>
himſelfe in, were Humility, Obedience, and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and that taske ended, hee purpoſed to make a ſtrong Eſſay to gaine a habit in all the Cardinall, and leſſer Morall Vertues. In the ſervice of theſe he made a vow to ſpend the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of his dayes, ſetting apart the vertues of <hi>Italy,</hi> where every Painter, Dancer, Tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawer, and Mountebanke is cald a <hi>Vertuoſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here his religious parents ſtept in againe to his ayde, who did not imitate the Images of <hi>Mercury</hi> ſet up in times paſt in the common Roades, with the fore-finger poynting out the way to paſſengers, but ſtanding ſtill themſelves, not bearing them company. This loving couple (as happy in themſelves, as in him) were his guides not onely by Advice, but Action.</p>
            <p>The reaſon why hee beganne with Humility was, that it render'd him more apt and able to <note place="margin">Humillity extolled in it ſelfe and him.</note> acquire the reſt, and was the vertue his, and our bleſſed Maſter commenc'd and ended with, and all the Saints in imitation of him have ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and with diligence put in practice. Our ſweeteſt Saviour forbade his Diſciples to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulge his miracles, leaſt the World might thinke he gloryed in them, as appeares by his cure of the Leprous, of the Blind, of the Lame, and of the Dumbe, &amp;c. In his Transfiguration hee gave them the ſame charge; <hi>Reveale this Viſion to no body.</hi> His Diſciples demanding who ſhould be the greateſt in the Kingdome of Heaven, he anſwered, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall humble himſelfe like</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:18330:27"/>
               <hi>one of theſe little ones, ſhall bee greateſt there.</hi> What taught he but Humility, when hee ſaid, <hi>When thou art invited to a wedding, take not the firſt place at the Table.</hi> What can perſwade a man ſooner to avoyd Vaine-glory, and to enrole himſelfe amongſt the ſervants of Humility, than his moving example of the Phariſee, and the Publican? He made choiſe to bee conceived of a poore humble Mother, and to bee borne not onely in no remarkable Country, but in a Stable, where beaſts onely were witneſſes of his Birth. Thirty yeares hee lurked in the World, in ſomuch that we read little or nothing of him in all that time, ſave that when hee was twelve yeares old, hee was found hearing, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogating, and determining in the Temple. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his thirtieth yeare hee ſent not for Saint <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> but came to him, and deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Baptiſme at his hands: wherein wee learne a profitable leſſon for the proud, who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine to viſite their Inferiours. Hee that came from Heaven ſcorn'd not to wait on earth, on his owne ſervant: and ſhall inſolent men who live on earth, and are made of earth, ſcorne or grudge to give each other a viſite? He began his preaching in the ſame humble manner as <hi>John</hi> did, <hi>Repent, &amp;c.</hi> He intruded not into the Nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials of the rich and lofty, but of the meeke, and penurious, where Wine was wanting. When hee underſtood they meant to make him a King, hee flew into the Mountaines to conceale himſelfe.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:18330:28"/>
He being Lord of all things, paid Tribute as a ſervant. Hee travailed commonly on foot, and when he was weary, hungry, and dry, his lodging and fare were little better then that of the irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall Creatures. This is with eaſe proved, for he complains himſelfe, that hee hath not a houſe to put his head in: and wee finde that when hee was faint and thirſty, hee had no other repoſe then on the ground, nor no other drinke then that pure Water drawne for him, by that purer <hi>Samaritan.</hi> Hee elected humble Diſciples, and preached to them Humility. Hee ſaid not to them, <hi>Be Omnipotent as I am Omnipotent, Be Wiſe as I am Wiſe;</hi> No, no, his Doctrine flew a lower pitch, and was delivered in a more ſtoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing phraſe, <hi>Be humble, as I am humble.</hi> He named himſelfe the ſonne of man, oftner then the ſonne of God, and though hee was truly both, in that he participated of both Natures, yet hee choſe his Denomination oftner from the inferiour na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture then from the ſuperiour. Hee made his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try into <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> not like a Triumpher in a Chariot, nor on a proud Courſer with rich Trappings, but on a ſily Aſſe void of rich Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture. Being to depart out of this World, that he might leave behind him an unequall'd and unheard of Example of Humilitie, he waſh'd his Diſciples feet, and wip'd them with the linnen cloth wherewith hee was girt. Laſtly, every cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of his Paſſion relliſheth humilitie. Did the Saints digreſſe a whit from this path trod by
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:18330:28"/>
their Redeemer? Surely no, one proofe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we have in St. <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> whoſe thoughts, deeds, and words were all humble. The <hi>Iewes</hi> enquiring of him whether hee were Chriſt, or a Prophet, he anſwered negatively to both: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as our Saviour proteſteth that the Humane Race could never boaſt of a greater then he. Hee aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med no higher a ſtile then, <hi>I am the voice in the Wilderneſſe, &amp;c.</hi> His Diet, his Raiment, and his Lodging were all contemptible. How often did that faire recover'd Bankerupt of all Grace, <hi>Mary Magdalene,</hi> fall at our Saviours feet, and waſh them with her teares? After the miraculous cure of the lame by <hi>Peter;</hi> his ſpeech was lowly, not attributing the fact to himſelfe, but to the divine Vertue, and the Invocation of the Name of JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS. When upon his entry into <hi>Caeſaria, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi> meeting him fell at his feet, hee rais'd him up, ſaying, <hi>I am a man alſo as thou art. Paul,</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> hearing that the Inhabitants of the City of <hi>Lyſtris,</hi> concluded they were Gods and reſolved to ſacrifice to them, cut their garments in pieces, and running into the midſt of the Throng, cried out; <hi>What mean you to do? Wee are no other then poore Mortals, as you are;</hi> Yet with this their clamour could they hardly keep the ſuperſtitious people from ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to them. <hi>Paul</hi> ſubmitted himſelfe to learne of <hi>Aquila,</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla,</hi> the Art of Tent-making, and got his living by it. This laſt, but moſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the Apoſtles, was a ſubmiſſive petitioner
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:18330:29"/>
for the prayers of others. <hi>I beſeech you Brethren,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>even in the Name of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and the Charitie of the Holy Ghoſt, to aſſiſt me with your Prayers.</hi> In other places hee termeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the leaſt of the Apoſtles, and profeſſeth that he deſerveth not the name of an Apoſtle. In his Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> hee deſcendeth yet lower; <hi>Ieſus,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>came into the world to ſave Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, whereof I am the chiefe.</hi> Of the ſame Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility relliſh theſe his meeke formes of ſpeech, <hi>Not aſpiring to height of Knowledge, and thinking themſelves ſuperiours to one another onely in Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie. Armatura tutiſſima animi Modeſtia,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Baſil, A modeſt humble minde is an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of proofe.</hi> Wittily Saint <hi>Bernard, As the morning Light is a ſure ſigne that the Sun is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into our Hemiſpheare; ſo the very dawne of Humility in any man, is an infallible Token of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Grace.</hi> This is the Vertue that ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens all the reſt, and a good Frame, and ſecuritie ever attend it. By this the holy Martyrs have triumph'd over Tyranny, and Death, and by it have obtain'd the eternall Crown of Glory they now weare. He who void of Humility, ſeeks to engroſſe other Vertues, doe like him who gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth duſt to throw it againſt the winde. This Vertue never entred into the Heads or Hearts of the Heathen. <hi>Nulla tanta eſt Humilitas,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Valerius Maximus) quae dulcedine Gloriae non tangatur: There is no Humilitie ſo great, as to be altogether ſenſeleſſe of the ſweetneſſe of Glory.

The <hi>Stoicall,</hi> Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquent Sect uttterly excluded Humility, and the <hi>Cynick</hi> though hee appeared ſordid and abject, was thought by other Sects as inwardly haughty as hee was outwardly dejected, which was inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by his ſpeech, who ſaid to one of them, <hi>That hee eſpied his pride through the hole in his Cloake.</hi> The Poets went this way altogether, as farre as they,</p>

            <p>In this ſubmiſſive Vertue this our ſweete Bud of Honour grew to ſuch a height, that hee had many noble Emulatours who aſpired to climbe to the ſame degree. Hee made Mans miſerable condition the Mirrour wherein his Humilitie beheld her ſelfe. Hee rightly conceived, that as the Tree that growes high muſt take deep root: ſo the Minde that aſcends to God muſt firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate it ſelfe before him. His ſanctified ſoule (if her Creatour accepted of her poore endevours) was altogether careleſſe of the applauſe of men, like a chaſte Spouſe, who being raviſh'd with the delight ſhe takes in the kiſſes and embraces of her Huſband, is nothing at all mindfull or carefull of the frownes, or favours of others: yet did ſhe humbly comply with all men as farre as the Service, and Honour of her Maker would give her leave.</p>
            <p>This Vertue prepar'd him to receive the yoke of Obedience, which he readily put on, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <note place="margin">Obedience commended in it ſelfe, and him.</note> after diſobediently caſt off. He was confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable in all things to the Word of God, the Church, his Prince, Parents, Tutours, and Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours That there was a God hee learn'd from the Order, and Beauty of the Univerſe, which to attribute to the Vertue, or power of things
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:18330:30"/>
created were to aſcribe the motion of the wheel to the wheele it ſelfe, or the Excellencie of an Image to the Penſill. Hee ſaw nothing that put him not in minde of God, but being admitted to be a member of his myſticall Body, his Church, he there ſaw him more cleerly, ſpake to him, and receiv'd from him his divine beheſts, of which he forth with vowed himſelfe a moſt obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, and religious obſerver.</p>
            <p>The Duty hee owed his Parents, Nature had <note place="margin">His obedience to his parents.</note> ingrafted in him, and Grace had aſſured him that hee deſerves neither the ſtile of Noble, nor of Man, who neglects to bee dutifull to thoſe to whom he owes his Life, and Being. A reverence to theſe in-ſeated in the Bloud. Two ſtrange de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of this Veritie wee finde in <hi>Livie,</hi> and <hi>Valerius Maximus.</hi> The firſt is, that <hi>Marcus</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Two rare ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liall duty, and pietie.</note> 
               <hi>Pomponius</hi> having accuſed <hi>Lucius Manlius</hi> of cruelty to <hi>Titus Manlius</hi> his ſonne, the ſaid <hi>Titus</hi> went to the Houſe of <hi>Pomponius</hi> then Tribune, and with his Sword drawne, threatned to kill him, unleſſe hee would ſweare to let the Proceſſe fall againſt his Father, and forced him to take that Oath. The later in <hi>Valerius Maximus,</hi> is of a Woman condemned to die by Famine, whom her Daughter then a Nurſe (having leave daily to viſit her Mother) nouriſhed with her milke, which pious deceit of hers being detected, bred that relenting, and aſtoniſhment in the hearts of the Judges, that they not only pardoned the Mother, but in memory of this pious, dutifull
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:18330:31"/>
fact of the Daughter, razed the Priſon to the ground, and erected in the ſame place a Temple to Pietie. <hi>Diceret aliquis,</hi> ſaith <hi>Valerius, hoc eſſe contra legem Naturae, niſi Naturae prima lex eſſet diligere parentes: A man would ſay, that for the Daughter to give ſuck to the Mother were a thing prepoſterous, and againſt Nature, were it not that the firſt Law of Nature is to love our Parents. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle</hi> affirmes, that the Storks nouriſh their Dammes, in way of a gratefull recompenſation of their care, and pains in breeding them. <hi>Quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid praeſtiti,</hi> ſaith <hi>Seneca, infra aeſtimationem Paterni Muneris eſt: What ever I have perform'd, comes ſhort of the Benefits for which I ſtand a Debtor to my Father.</hi> None but Monſters of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude forget ſuch bleſſings as theſe.</p>
            <p>His Tutours he honour'd and obey'd, not for feare of puniſhment, but love of Diſcipline. Hee <note place="margin">His obedience to his Tutors.</note> ſufferd not himſelfe to be hail'd, and dragg'd to his Book, but was as ſedulous in learning as his Maſters in teaching, who (no doubt) had told him that the Muſes love a ſmiling Schollar, not one who lowers on them, and beholds the Schoole with the ſame countenance Malefactors looke on the Gibbet. I cannot ſay whether his alacrity in receiving, or his care in executing his Tutors commands were the greater.</p>
            <p>The eſteeme of the holy Prophets, Apoſtles, and Fathers of the Church had this Vertue in ought to advance it much in our eſteeme. God bound man to obedience preſently after his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:18330:31"/>
in the ſtate of innocencie, the breach whereof hee ſeverely puniſh'd. <hi>Noah</hi> readily o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey'd all Gods commands when the Floud was at hand. The ſwift obedience of <hi>Abraham</hi> was admirable, when without any delay at all, he made haſte to ſacrifice his ſonne, and with his owne hands to let out his own blood. It is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy our obſervation, that when ever the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or any of Gods ſervants fought with, or againſt his will, they had accordingly good, or bad ſucceſſe. God told that if hee wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly executed all his precepts, hee would ever fixe the Throne of his Kingdome in <hi>Hieruſalem:</hi> but on the contrary, if he did not perform them, he would cut <hi>Iſrael</hi> from off the face of the earth. <hi>Therefore,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Gregory, is obedience better then ſacrifice, becauſe by ſacrifice anothers fleſh, but by obedience our own wils are ſubdued, ſlaine, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferd up to the Almightie. An obedient man,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Bernard, deferres not the execution of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, but ſtraight prepares his eares to heare, his Tongue to ſpeake, his feet to walke, his hands to worke, and all his thoughts are fix'd on the will of his Commander.</hi> And in another place, the ſame Father ſaith, <hi>That there is, no doubt, but hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves more grace, and favour, who prepares and makes himſelfe readie to receive a command, then hee who willingly executes the ſame.</hi> To this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes that of <hi>Plantus,</hi>

            <p>The next that preſents it ſelfe to our view is Charity, a Vertue that will uſher any man to <note place="margin">Charitie prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in it ſelfe, and him.</note> Gods preſence, who is ambitious of that greateſt of Glories. This Love is the King of all the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the ſoule, and motions of the Heart, he attracts all the reſt to him, and renders them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to himſelfe. His Eſſence conſiſts in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good works readily, diligently, frequently. Let us heare that excellent Father Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> magnifie this Vertue. <hi>In Charity,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>the poore are rich, and without it the rich are poor. This ſuſtaines us in adverſitie, tempers us in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, fortifies us againſt unruly paſſions, and makes us joyfully do good works.

What ſhall I ſay? ſhould I ſpeake with the tongues of men, and Angels, and want Charitie I were nothing, it being the ſoule of Divine Knowledge, the Vertue of Propheſie, the ſalvation contained in the Sacraments, the fruit of Faith, the riches of the poore, and the life of the dying.</hi> He addes, <hi>A man may have all the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and yet be evill, but he cannot have Charitie and be ſo.</hi> Againe, <hi>Science if it be alone, is puffed up with pride, but becauſe Charitie edifies, ſhe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers not Knowledge to ſwell.</hi> He calls it in another place, <hi>the cement of ſoules, and the ſocietie of the Faithfull.</hi> Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> commends it to us in theſe words. <hi>I do not remember any one hath died an ill death, who willingly perform'd the Works of Charity: the reaſon is becauſe hee hath many Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours, and it is a thing impoſſible that the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of many ſhould not penetrate the ſacred eares of God.</hi> Sweetly, ſaith St. <hi>Gregory.

I will adde that of <hi>Hugo, O divine Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, I know not how I ſhould ſpeake more in thy prayſe, then that thou didſt draw God from Heaven to Earth, and didſt exalt Man from Earth to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.

            </p>
            <p>In ſo few yeares as fourteene, a man can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect onely a propenſion to this, and all other Vertues: yet he that looks for no ſmall progreſſe in this, and moſt of the other (for the practice of ſome are not incident to that tender age) ſhall not have his expectation deceiv'd. For his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, I may truly averre, that it was extenſive not onely to his friends, and acquaintance, but to the poore, to ſtrangers, and enemies alſo. Some friends he choſe both for ſupport, and ornament, <note place="margin">His love to his Friends.</note> as appeares by his love, and imitation of his truly good, and great Guardian, the Earle of <hi>Arundell,</hi> Lord Marſhall of <hi>England,</hi> for no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner had age ripened his judgement, but hee ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted him for the object of his affections, and the modell of his actions. A copy drawne from ſo faire an originall, you will ſay could not prove deform'd. Others hee choſe for delight, and all hee lov'd with a heart wherein Truth kept her Court. Some he would to his power ſo ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſecretly, and cunningly relieve, that they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times found their wants ſupplyed, before they knew from whence the benefit came, reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling in this a Phyſician, who cures his patient unawares, before he dreams of a recovery. Hee
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:18330:33"/>
approved that ſpeech of <hi>Diogenes, Manus ad a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micos non complicatis digitis extendi oportere: That a cloſed hand is not to bee reached out to a Friend.</hi> Where he diſcovered a compleat worth, he diſdained not to be a ſuitor, and firſt to make an offer of his ſervice, in imitation of a Huſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who firſt tilleth, and ſoweth the ground, and then expects the fruit of his labour. His word, and the effect of it, were as inſeparable as heat and fire. This true property of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man the Ancients decipher'd to us, when they painted a Tongue bound faſt to a Heart. He was no importunate, or ſevere Exactor of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne of a love anſwerable in greatneſſe to his owne; wiſely, and nobly conſidering that hee is no true friend who is alwayes no more a friend then his friend is.</p>
            <p>Marry (I muſt confeſſe) hee was exceedingly <note place="margin">His curioſitie in the choice of his friends.</note> curious, and cautious in his choice, following in that the counſell of <hi>Bias</hi> the Philoſopher, <hi>Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cos ſequere quos non pudeat elegiſſe: Follow ſuch friends whom to have choſen you need not be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m'd.</hi> Hee applauded that of <hi>Anacharſis, Multo melius eſt amicum unum egregium quam grega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rios multos poſſidere. It is farre better to enjoy one brave Friend then many meane and vulgar.</hi> Hee knew that they who in haſte, and without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture adviſe contract friendſhip, ſuffer the ſame inconveniencie as they do, who greedily and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily devoure ſundry meates which they can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther quickly with eaſe and ſafety caſt up, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:18330:34"/>
He diſcreetly weighed, that friendſhip made with the wicked, is as unſtable Vice, the Baſis whereon it is built. As the Ocean with great labour ſtrives to worke all dead bodies to the ſhore; ſo a generous friendſhip expells all ſuch as are loſt, and dead in ſinne. It is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to be wiſe and good our ſelves, but we muſt not keepe the fooliſh and the wicked com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, except we will incurre the cenſure of the World, and be our ſelves thought ſuch. Vice, and the Vitious he fought with, after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> flying. If his deareſt friend had ſolicited him to joyne with him in any act not warranted by Vertue, he would have anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him with <hi>Pericles,</hi> who to an intimate friend that woed him to forſware himſelfe in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, replyed; <hi>I am my friends friend as farre as the Altars.</hi> As if he ſhould had ſaid, <hi>I will paſſe for thee through all miſeries, dangers, and ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracks, ſave that of Conſcience, which like a Maid of Honour, I muſt preſerve inuiolated, and immaculate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As he was extreamly nice, and carefull, not to entertaine debauch't friends, ſo was hee alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd <note place="margin">A herd of Friends hee lov'd not.</note> not to admit of many. He was not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that a River which hath many Armes, and out-lets, is alwayes in danger of being low, and drye. <hi>Plutarch</hi> maintaines, hee cannot be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and honeſt, who hath a herd of friends, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe many may want his Faith, and aſſiſtance at one and the ſame time, to all which hee cannot
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:18330:34"/>
bee ſerviceable. But thoſe he had once judicially choſen, and on whom he had fixed his affection hee ſtill regarded with the ſame countenance; whether they were in a flood, or an ebbe of Fortune, cleane contrary to the courſe of fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, and diſſemblers, who fawne on their friends in aboundance, and forſake them in pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nury, not unlike in this to Flies, which came in ſwarmes to a Kitchin full of fleſh, and abandon it empty.</p>
            <p>His affection to his friends tooke nothing <note place="margin">His love to the poore.</note> from his care, and love of the poore. It was not hidden from him, that the chiefe worke of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, is to have pitty on a mans owne ſoule; hee therefore firſt endeavoured to mundifie his owne heart, knowing that God more than man reſpects the pure minde of the giver. True it is, he was in his Nonage, and had no great ſtore out of which his Liberallity ſhould flow, but all hee could ſpare Charity diſpos'd of. God Crownes the intent where he findes not the faculty. Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate Mercy proceedes not from a full purſe, but a free boſome. He that in his heart com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionates his neighbours infortunity, deſerves more of him, and in the ſight of God, than hee who gives him onely a materiall Almes, for hee who gives, parteth onely with his outward ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; but he who affords the indigent ſighes, teares, and groanes, imparts that which comes from within, from the very Center of the ſoule. He kept to himſelfe onely what was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:18330:35"/>
and the ſuperfluous he imparted to the Needy. Hee piouſly meditated, that Poverty is a conſecrated Field, that quickly returnes the ſower a plentifull harveſt. It fares with ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, as with temporall Husbandry, unleſſe ſeed be ſcattered, no encreaſe can be expected. He laid up his Treaſure in his true eternal Country, Heaven: He thought continually that he heard the voice of his Saviour thus ſaying. <hi>I was thy Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, now make me thy Debtour, become my Vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, and thou ſhalt centuply receive the Summe thou disburſeſt.</hi> In obedience to his command he aſſiſted, as farre as in him lay, all that wanted. He that gives indifferently to all, ſhall ever bee mercifull, but he who ſits upon the Lifes of the poore, and judgeth them according to their faults, not their neceſſities, ſhall ſeldome or never doe good. We ought to caſt our eye on nature, not on the perſon, according to that of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who being reprehended for ſuccouring a Lewd, but poore man, replyed, <hi>De Humanitati, non Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini. I give to Humane Nature, not to the man.</hi> He murders the poor, who denyes him that whereby he ſubſiſts. Moſt accurſed is he who ſhuts up in his Coffers the Health and Life of the diſtreſſed. In vain he lifts up his hands to heaven, who extends them not to the ſuccor of the afflicted. It is a love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ruine, and a pleaſing ſpectacle to Chriſt, to ſee a devoute man undoe himſelf with his own hands, in freely and readily beſtowing al that he hath on the naked. But oh! it is deſervedly to be lamented
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:18330:35"/>
that the whilome downy open hands of mercy are now ſhut, and brawny, and that moſt men ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of a flinty Nature, or out of a needleſſe feare to be thought Vaine-glorious leave to bee pious. To the former hard-hearted brood, whom no miſery of another can move. I wil ſay with <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, If they merit the Epithets of wiſe &amp; valiant they ſhall not be denyed them, but we will never grant they ſhall be ſtiled wiſe, and valiant men Men, ſince they have unman'd themſelves, loſt their bowels, and caſt off all Humanity.</hi> The later, who make Vaine-glory their ſcruple, I can aſſure that the Benefit is not deſpicable before God, which is confirm'd in the ſight of men, but that which is done to the end men may ſee it.</p>
            <p>From his proneſſe in giving, we now come <note place="margin">His ready for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries.</note> to his readineſſe in forgiving, another office of Charity, executed with farre greater difficulty than any of the former. To love deſert in friends, or ſupply the wants of the needy, reaſon and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture invite us, but to ſuffer diſgraces, and intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable injuries from worthles men, is a thing they both abhorre: for that of <hi>Seneca</hi> is moſt true; <hi>Duplicat dolorem ſuſtinentis indignitas Inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis. The griefe of the ſuſtainer is doubled by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity of the Afflictor.</hi> Appoſitively to this <hi>Cicero; Qui ſe non defendit, nec obſiſtit injuriae, ſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poteſt, tam eſt in vitio quam ſi parentes, aut ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cos, aut patriam deſerat: Hee who defendeth not himſelfe, and repelleth not an injury, if he can, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits as great a crime as he that forſakes his Parents,</hi>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:18330:36"/>
               <hi>Friends, or Countrey.</hi> It is a thing not very hard for fleſh and blood to rejoyce in God, and his Bleſſings, but very difficult it is to take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in all Slanders, Infamy, and Perſecutions for his ſake: for that gentle ſubmiſſive ſoule, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which Ambition, nor the leaſt thought of honour ever entered, would yet moſt gladly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyd all abuſes, and diſhonours. But our now truely bleſſed one, the beloved Theme wee now handle, had learnt this holy humble Art of him, whoſe life was nothing but a continued paſſion. All injuries intended, or acted againſt himſelfe he could freely pardon: but thoſe which were directed againſt the Majeſty and dignity of his Maker, he could not endure. In ſuch a caſe a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fury becomes the Child of God. It favour'd in his opinion of more piety and wiſedome, to overcome a ſlight injury, that reached not to his Parentage, or Religion, with ſilence, than with a tart replye; having found in Story, that ſmall words have overthrowne great Cities. No wrong being equall to that which is done with reproach, and contumely, in that to an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roicke Spirit the loſſe of blood is not ſo grievous as that of Reputation.</p>
            <p>We will now deſcend from the Divine to the <note place="margin">Valour mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified in it ſelfe and him.</note> Morall Vertues; amongſt which Valour (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the generall vulgar beliefe) is the firſt required in a Lord, or Cavallier. Therefore the Poets feigne the god of Warre himſelfe to bee borne in <hi>Thrace,</hi> becauſe the people of that

Country are hardy, and couragious. This was to denote that Fortitude uſuall reſides amongſt men of a generous, and lofty ſtraine, whoſe Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation leads them to knowledge in good Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which at once informes them of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown of their Anceſtors; and that the image of <hi>Fame</hi> was ever placed before the Temple of <hi>Mars,</hi> to intimate, that the great exploits of daring, and undaunted men, are by her carried in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to every corner of the earth.

Fourthly, not being urged thereto by the violence of naturall paſſions, as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Griefe, Luſt, and the like. Fiftly, not out of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of his enemies force, nor out of feare of ſervitude, or hope of bootie. Sixtly, a valiant man is the Champion of honeſtie; for which onely hee is to combate all that oppoſe it.</hi> He could not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine any thing in excellencie above Honeſty, which he ſtill makes his utmoſt ſcope, not being ſo bleſſedly ſubtile as to diſcerne God and his Church. Examine wel all theſe Requiſites of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and how many now a dayes ſhall we diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and allow valiant; moſt men fighting againſt all the Rules of Honeſty, and the Laws of God? If our Nobility and Gentry ſhall diligently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe ancient Hiſtories, they ſhall finde that their renowned Anceſtours never aſcended to the Throne of Honour this way. Debauſhes, Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, and Duels were not the degrees by which
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:18330:39"/>
they mounted. They ſingl'd not out an enemy in the field upon exchange of idle words, never drawing their ſwords but to reſcue their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey out of the jawes of Ruine, or their Prince from the Height of a Breach, or from the Centre of the Enemies Battalion. The Valour not thus nobly imploy'd, they reputed no other then a womaniſh choler, a ſimple paſſion and a feeble revenge unworthy of a man magnanimous. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, our Gallants cannot but imagine the great <hi>Alexander,</hi> and the mightie <hi>Iulius</hi> to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing inferiour to them in this Vertue, yet did not they judge that a fooliſh haſtie word ſhould be put in ballance with a Life. Theſe Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirits of the World were utterly ignorant what reparation of Honour the Lie claimed, and of the circumſtances in managing a Quarrell, which theſe Hackſters make our yonger ſort believe to be a Myſtery, and by this ridiculous Science get their Livings. Thoſe great Worthies concluded that the offence alwayes return'd upon his head that offerd it. From theſe ſingle, bloudy Encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, what can Gentlemen expect other then if they kill, to have their Lands confiſcated to the King, and (if married) to have their Wives and Children live by the ſuccour of the Knapſack, to leave infamy to their Poſterity, and to have no other Hiſtoriographer then the Hangman; whereas their lives loſt in a ſet Battaile, would make them ever live in the beſt Chronicles of theirs, and after times. Now ſuppoſe they fall
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:18330:39"/>
themſelves under their enemies hands, what can enſue but a burial of their Names together with their bones, and (without Gods infinite extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary mercy) the damnation of their ſoules? Theſe Duels, and the Horſe-races of our Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ſo much in requeſt with them, have two goodly originals. The firſt began amongſt the ſlaves of <hi>Haniball,</hi> after he had paſſed the <hi>Alpes,</hi> and the later amongſt the Butchers of <hi>Barnet,</hi> who (their <hi>London</hi> Markets once ended) ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dows'd in drinke, uſed to run home for wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. What will theſe Fighters ſay, if I prove to them out of the great Secretary of Nature, <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle,</hi> that a man may feare, and yet be valiant? <hi>Firſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>a valiant man may dread all things ſhamefull and wicked, and the Infamy of himſelfe, and his. Secondly, he may feare all things ſo dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that they exceed the power of Humane Nature to withſtand, as Thunder, Lightning, Earthquakes, Inundations, and the like, which yet he feares not, ſo that they ſhall make him forget to do the office of a man reſolved.</hi> Nay, hee ſtops not there, but maintaines that a valiant man may flie from an enemy without being juſtly branded with co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardiſe, in caſe hee findes his Life may be more profitable to his Countrey then his Death. Hee cannot then be ſaid to ſhun death out of puſilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity, but to reſerve himſelfe for a greater good.</p>
            <p>But I deſire to be read by my owne Light; for I would not have any man thinke that I inferre
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:18330:40"/>
by this Invective againſt the abuſe of this He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick Vertue, that I counſell any Gentleman to endure groſſe Injuries of a high nature, ſuch as may diſparage his whole Race, Countrey, Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or hazard the ſafety of his perſon; for of theſe foule wrongs, all Nations allow a Repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and the Ancients called this harmleſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, <hi>Incorruptam Tutelam.</hi> Therefore <hi>Mars</hi> was pictured with his Boſome open, to ſhew un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us that worthy men ought to expoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to all dangers, for the preſervation of their Honour.</p>
            <p>This deare Gentleman, whoſe loſſe wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dole, had not yet received force and vigour to make a demonſtration of the externall va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, but the internall he had abundantly, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared by many ſeeds of true Magnanimity, which both by his carriage and ſpeech, were ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily to be diſcern'd in him. Such ſparkes as theſe of a great minde the <hi>Romans</hi> diſcover'd in <hi>Cato</hi> yet a childe, and by thoſe judg'd of his future <note place="margin">Two admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſignes of <hi>Cato's</hi> future valour diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd in him yet a childe.</note> Greatneſſe. Two of theſe, as moſt remarkable, I ſhall here inſert not onely to delight but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, and ſtrengthen the mindes of my Readers. He, and his brother <hi>Caepio,</hi> being educated in the Houſe of their Unkle <hi>Livius Druſus,</hi> it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that the <hi>Latines</hi> were at that time ſuitours for the obtaining of a City, and that one of the chiefe of them, <hi>Popedius Silo,</hi> was entertain'd, and lodg'd in the Houſe of <hi>Druſus. Popedius</hi> one day amongſt the reſt talking, and jeſting fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:18330:40"/>
with the children, ſaid to them, <hi>Will not you intercede with your Unkle that wee may have a Citie granted us?</hi> To this <hi>Caepio</hi> fairly and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily aſſented, and promis'd his utmoſt aid, but <hi>Cato</hi> ſilent and ſullen, look'd on him with a brow knit, which <hi>Popedius</hi> obſerving, in a feigned fury, tooke the childe up in his armes, and held him out of the window, threatning to let him fall, unleſſe hee granted his requeſt. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all his threats, <hi>Cato</hi> ſtill continued his ſilence, and his frowns; whereupon <hi>Popedius</hi> ſet him down againe, and whiſpered this ſoftly to his friends ſtanding by. <hi>What will this childe doe when he comes to be a man? I believe wee ſhall not obtaine by his conſent one voice from the people of Rome.</hi> Another proofe of his Magnanimity hee gave in the time of <hi>Sylla.</hi> Being about the age of fourteen, <hi>Sarpedon</hi> his Tutour carried him to ſalute <hi>Sylla,</hi> who civilly and gently receiv'd him, in remembrance of the friendſhip he had contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with his father. The palace of <hi>Sylla,</hi> was then no better then a ſlaughter-houſe, into which men were carried bound, and there ſuffered all kinde of wracks and tortures, and after thoſe death it ſelfe. The heads of proſcribed men were as commonly and openly carried in and out, as if they had belong'd to beaſts: which <hi>Cato</hi> at ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Viſits, not onely took notice of, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all mark'd how good men ſigh'd and groan'd at this cruelty, and he himſelfe abhorring ſo bloudy a Tyranny, with a reſolute minde, and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:18330:41"/>
ſaid to his Tutour; <hi>Why does no man kill this monſter of men?</hi> To this <hi>Sarpedo</hi> replyed, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they fear him more then they hate him: but you</hi> anſwered <hi>Cato, have given me a Sword that I may diſpatch him, and free my Countrey from ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</hi> Hee utterd this with ſuch fierceneſſe, that <hi>Sarpedo</hi> after that time ſeldome or never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him to <hi>Sylla,</hi> or, if he did, it was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out preparation of him by his authority, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe.</p>
            <p>From the vanquiſhing of outward Enemies, <note place="margin">Temperancie extolled in it ſelfe, and him.</note> our method leads us to the ſubduing of inward, which are our paſſions and affections. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour of theſe is Temperancie, who is Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Minion, and ſtudies her preſervation. By this Reaſon governes the ſenſuall part, tames it, and makes it endure the Bitt. Without this, our paſſions will violently carry us into the gulph of pleaſure, out of which few or none return at all, or, if they doe, it is not without ſuffering of ſhipwrack, and extreame perill. Delights betray us with kiſſing, and having charm'd us into a profound ſleep, we no ſooner awake, but wee ſee our ſelves environ'd with Horrour and Deſpair, out of whoſe ſharpe claws none ever yet eſcaped unwounded. In the entry to Voluptuouſneſſe we diſcerne nothing but Roſes, Violets, and the prime flowers of the Spring ſtrewed in our way, but in comming backe, wee view nothing but unked, diſmall Objects of ſolitude, and ſorrow. The comfort is incredible of thoſe who joyfully
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:18330:41"/>
flie into the imbraces of this Vertue, loathing and abhorring the very ſhadow of Intemperan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, which ugly Traytreſſe never leaves Youth till ſhe hath brought them to thoſe <hi>Precipices</hi> which ſhe hath prepared for their deſtruction. The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Oratour <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> upbraided the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> with this folly, that they never treated of peace, but in mourning Garments, which they wore for their friends lately loſt in the Warres. And this is the cuſtome of luxurious men, they never ſo much as mention Sobriety, and Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie of Life, till they are under the laſh of the Phyſician, or the hand of Death. <hi>We are by much more vertuous,</hi> ſaith <hi>Pliny, in ſickneſſe then in health, wee then make God and Vertue our conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall meditation, and are no longer ruled by our paſſions and affections. We are not then Amorous, Ambitious, Covetous, Revengefull.</hi> Riot is like a fierce untamed Tiger, the keeping whereof is as perillous as the taking. Wee muſt here imitate <hi>Vliſſes,</hi> not his followers, whom <hi>Circes</hi> turn'd into Swine. If wee lend an eare to the inticing, raviſhing voice of pleaſure, we alſo ſhall be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd into beaſts. This Vertue is exercis'd in brideling, and reſtraining the inordinate appetite to meat, drinke, and Venery. The <hi>Romans</hi> uſed ever to imbowell their dead, and not to allow thoſe ignoble parts, the panch, and guts buriall, as being the onely cauſers of our Diſſolution. Hee is unworthy the Name, and Definition of man, who lives onely to eat. <hi>Diogenes</hi> called the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:18330:42"/>
Belly the <hi>Charybdis</hi> of the Life. <hi>Muſonius</hi> the Philoſopher warns us that it is decent, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoofefull that man alone, amongſt all Creatures, being deſcended from the Gods ſhould chiefly nouriſh himſelfe, as they do, with contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not minding food farther then to ſatisfy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Drunkenneſſe, and Gluttony are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended under exceſſe, who is the common mother to both.</p>
            <p>The Ancients repreſented to us the uglineſſe <note place="margin">Drunkenneſſe diſpraiſed.</note> of the former, by picturing <hi>Bacchus</hi> naked and young, to ſignifie unto us, that Drunkards can keepe nothing ſecret. As when Wine begins to worke in a Veſſell, that part of it which is in the bottome mounts up to the top: ſo a Drunkard diſcloſeth the ſecrets that lie in the very bottom of his heart. His Chariot was drawn by Lions, Leopards, and Panthers, to intimate unto us that Wine metamorphoſeth them into Savage bruits, that drinke it beyond meaſure. They drew him clad in Goats skins, to denotate the incontinencie of ſuch. His Sacrifices were ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily executed by women, to argue the effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacie of men given over to that vice.</p>
            <p>Neither are Surfeits of meate leſſe odious and <note place="margin">Gluttony re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended.</note> enormous then theſe of drinke. What a ſtrange and undecent ſight is it to behold men lothing, and longing for meats, like women with child? Where this Vice raignes, nothing of value can reſide. As when we behold the Sun through va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, and clouds, he appeares not to us ſo beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:18330:42"/>
as when hee is in his full ſhine, having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing interpos'd between him, and us: ſo a ſoule charged with Repletion &amp; Fumes that ariſe from excrements, and meates undigeſted is eclipſed, and through the miſts and fogs raiſed by ſenſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity can diſcerne nothing ſubtile and generous, expreſſing no more harmony in her functions than we can expect from an inſtrument fild with Durt and Rubbiſh. Uncleane ſpirits love un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane lodgings, as we may perceive by the Divells in the poſſeſſed man, who petition'd our Saviour that they might enter into the herd of hogs, not into Oxen, Sheep, or any other clean Beaſt, nouriſh'd with cleane food. The example of <hi>Dives</hi> ſhould much terrifie theſe ravenous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers, who was ſo cruelly tormented in his Tongue, the Organ of Taſt. The devill knew man to be ſo prone to this ſinne, that he made it the baite to catch our firſt Parents, and the ſnare wherwith he thought to hold faſt our Redemer. <hi>If thou bee the ſonne of God,</hi> ſaid hee, <hi>command theſe ſtones to be made bread. Innocentius</hi> thus inveighes againſt this ſuperfluous feeding. <hi>Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la Paradiſum clauſit, primogenituram Vendidit, ſuſpendit piſtorem, decollavit Baptiſtam, Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardam Princeps coquorum Templum incendit, &amp; Hieruſalem totam evertit: Gluttony firſt ſhut up Paradiſe, ſold the Birth-right, hang'd the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, beheaded St.</hi> John Baptiſt, Nabuzardam <hi>the Maſter Cooke burnt the Temple, and overthrew the Walls of Hieruſalem.</hi> The frequent uſe of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:18330:43"/>
meates and drinkes amongſt the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> (as their <hi>Jecur Anſerimum,</hi> their <hi>Porcus Trojanus, Sumen, Vvedulae, Ficedulae, Phaenicop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teri,</hi> and their generous Wines, <hi>Cecuba, Falerna, &amp;c.)</hi> cauſed them to be as much cenſur'd by ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Hiſtorians, as their vertues made them admir'd. The Naturalliſts report, that the Sea-horſe hath his heart placed in his belly, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate his voracity. <hi>Philoxenes</hi> wiſhed his neck were as long as a Cranes, that he might the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger feele the ſweetneſſe of his meate. I knew an old witty Epicure of this nation who hath often in the preſence of a whole Ordinary, wiſh'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a Cowe, that hee might eate his meate over twice. Alas, ſaid hee, a man hath ſmall pleaſure in feeding twice a day halfe an howre at a time, I would bee ever eating. He wiſhed if hee muſt needes goe to heaven hee mought bee wound up thether by a Jacke. All the while this glutton pamper'd his body, his ſoule ſtarv'd, receiving no nutriment, but what was uncleane and putrid. <hi>Sminderides</hi> rode a wooing attended by a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Cooks, a thouſand Fowlers, and as many Fiſhers. That this ſin of gluttony is no ſolitary vice, but is ever accompanied by Incontinency. St. <hi>Hirome</hi> tells us. <hi>Semper Saturitati junct a eſt Laſcivia: Vicina igitur ſunt venter, &amp; genitalia; pro membrorum ordine ordo vitiorum. Laſcivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe ever aſſociates ſaturity. Therefore are the Belly, and the ſecrets placed cloſe by one another, to ſhew that they are as neare in conſequence and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendancy</hi>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:18330:43"/>
               <hi>as in ſcituation, the one feeding and maintaining the other.</hi> Wherefore they were in no errour, who ſtiled hunger <hi>the friend of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity,</hi> in that it cooles the boyling blood, and renders the Fleſh ſubject to the Spirit. Water, Fruits, and Rootes were mans firſt ſuſtinance. Lord how farre is his dyet alter'd from its firſt ſimplicity? Remarkable is that ſaying of <hi>Alexander: I know no better a Cooke to procure me an Appetite to my dinner, than to riſe betimes, nor to my Supper, than to eate little at Dinner. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pictetus</hi> Counſaileth us, not to decke our Rooms with Tablets and Pictures, but with Sobriety, and Temperancy; in that the former onely feed the eyes, but the later the ſoule, to which they are eternall Ornaments.</p>
            <p>This our ſweetly diſpos'd Lord cloſely follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the advice of this Philoſopher, who in all his Actions did nothing without the conſultation, and approbation of Sobriety, and Modeſty. Hee never was invited to a feaſt, but he diligently cal'd to minde that hee had two gueſts to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, the body, and the ſoule; and that what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he beſtowed on the one, would be corrupted, and converted into Excrements; but what hee conferred on the other would enjoy the ſame E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity with it. He obſerv'd ſuch a beautifull Order in all his deſires, that they never ranne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, nor lagg'd behinde, but ever kept that rank in which Reaſon had placed them. He lived by a Rule compoſed, and confirm'd by either Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:18330:44"/>
and taught his ſoule to affect nothing ſhee might not lawfully covet. Thus wee ſee the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable fruit Temperancy brought forth in his mind, and will in all other wherein ſhee is once planted. I will give a period to the diſcourſe of this Vertue, with the words of <hi>Proſper,</hi> who thus extolls it. <hi>Temperantia facit abſtinentem, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum, ſobrium, moderatum, pudicum, tacitum, &amp; Verecundum. Haec Virtus ſi in animo habitat libidines fraenat affectus 'temperat' deſideria ſancta multiplicat, vitioſa caſtigat, omnia inter nos con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſaordinat, cogitationes pravas removet, ſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am inſerit, ignem libidinoſae cupiditatis extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guit, mentem placida Tranquilitate componit, &amp; totam ab omni in ſemper tempeſtate Vitiorum de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendit. Temperancy makes a man abſtinent, ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, ſober, moderate, chaſt, ſilent, and modeſt. This Vertue once entred into the mind, bridles luſt, tempers affections, multiplyes holy deſires, and chaſtiſeth the vitious, ſets our confuſed thoughts in order, and removes the wicked ones, inſerts knowledge, quencheth all libidinous flames with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us, compoſeth and ſetleth the minde in a pleaſing Tranquility, and evermore defends every part of it from all Stormes raiſed by Vice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Juſtice challengeth a place here, and deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it being a Cardinall Vertue, and of great <note place="margin">Juſtice exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in it ſelfe, and him.</note> eminency, not only amongſt the Morall, but Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine vertues alſo. <hi>Homer</hi> ſayes, ſhe was begotten by all the gods, ſo divers, and ſo admirable are
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:18330:44"/>
her effects. <hi>Cicero</hi> thus commends her to us: <hi>Justitia Virtutis ſplendor eſt Maximus, ex qua viri boni nominamur. Juſtice is the greateſt ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of vertue, from which we purchaſe the names of good men.</hi> Moſt elegantly <hi>Caſſiodorus: Iuſtitia non novit Patrem, non novit Matrem, veritate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> novit, perſona<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no accipit, Deum imitatur: Iuſtice knows neither Father, nor mother, ſhe knowes Truth; ſhe is no reſpector of perſons, and is in that an imitator of God.</hi> According to the ſtrict or ſlacke practice of this vertue, all Common-wealths have flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd, or decay'd. Without her what were Man-kinde, but a confuſed multitude of rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous hungry Lyons, living by rapines, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. This Vertue conſiſts of two parts, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributive, and commutative. The diſtributive is chiefely Regall, and appropriate to Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, Kings, Princes, and to all thoſe who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive their Authority from them. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutative is an equall and juſt dealing betweene all men, of what Condition ſoever they be.</p>
            <p>The former part is of greateſt dignity, and acted but by a few, and they of great ranke, and quality: yet of thoſe few how many ſhall we find that execute the great Offices committed to their charge by God himſelfe with impartiality and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity? The difference <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> puts betweene a juſt Prince and a Tyrant is, that the aime of the former is the publicke good, the ſcope of the later is his owne profit. Theſe two behold their Subjects with a different eye, no otherwiſe than a
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:18330:45"/>
Shepherd, and a Butcher looke on a ſheepe to different ends, the one to preſerve, the other to deſtroy it. A Tyrant is like <hi>Boreas,</hi> that ever threatens ſhipwrack and ruine; A juſt King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles <hi>Zephyrus,</hi> whoſe breath begets plentie and ſweetneſſe. That a juſt King, or Judge ought to be a moſt ſtudious, and carefull Inveſtigatour of the Truth, is taught us by the example of God himſelfe, who ſaid, <hi>I will deſcend, and ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the cry which is come unto mee be juſt, or no.</hi> The Ancients pictur'd <hi>Aſtraea</hi> (whom they made a Repreſentour of Juſtice) without a head, which they ſaid was in Heaven, to ſignifie that Juſtice ſhould not regard men, but have her eyes fixed on God. In <hi>Athens</hi> the Delinquents ever pleaded before the Judges with their faces covered, leſt the ſweetneſſe of ſome pleaſing countenance ſhould ſo much move, and ſo farre work upon them as to make them doe injuſtice.</p>
            <p>Two ſtupendious preſidents of Juſtice wee have in two mighty Monarchs, <hi>Seleuchus,</hi> and <note place="margin">Two ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</note> 
               <hi>Cambyſes. Seleuchus</hi> having made a law, the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion whereof he ordaind to be puniſh'd with the loſſe of both eyes: it moſt unfortunately hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened that his own ſonne was the firſt tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour of it, whereupon being a moſt indulgent Father, and withall a moſt ſevere Juſticer, to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the rigour of the Law, he cauſed one of his own eyes to be pulled out, and another of his ſonnes. <hi>Cambyſes</hi> having condemned a cruell and corrupt Judge to be flead alive, cauſed the chaire
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:18330:45"/>
of Juſtice to be covered with his skin, and make the ſonne of this monſtrous Oppreſſour ſit, and give judgement in it, for an aſtoniſhment, and terrour to him, and all ſucceeding Judges. <hi>Iunius Brutus</hi> executed his own children, for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring againſt the liberty of their Country. By the ſevere Lawes of <hi>Draco,</hi> which were written in bloud, when the Authour of a Crime could not be found out, even things inanimate were ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, condemn'd, throwne out of the City, bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed for ever, or broken in pieces, according to the Nature of the Fact. As a Phyſician, or Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion oftentimes adminiſters ſtinking and loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome potions, nay, ſometimes cuts off a limbe, and all this for the preſervation of his patient: ſo in the body politick, a juſt Judge alwayes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts bitter puniſhments on the putrid, wicked members of the Common-wealth, nay, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times cuts them off, having this for a State<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maxime, that hee who is mercifull to the bad, is cruell to the good.</p>
            <p>In this diſtributive part of Juſtice, no wiſe man can look that this our mirrour of the youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Nobility ſhould attaine to the leaſt degree of perfection, ſince neither his few yeares admitted, nor his Prince called him to ſit in the ſeat of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. In the commutative part hee was no way defective, doing to all men as hee would be done unto. In this hee ſtrictly in all points obeyed the advice of <hi>Seneca: Quiſquis Juſtitiam ſectari de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideras prius Deum time, &amp; ama, ut ameris à Deo.</hi>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:18330:46"/>
               <hi>Amabis Deum ſi in hoc illum imitaberis, ut velis omnibus prodeſſe, nihil nocere. Ab alio expectes quod alteri feceris. Praeſtabis parentibus pieta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, cognatis dilectionem, pacem cum hominibus habebis, bellum cum vitiis praeſtabis, amicis fidem, omnibus aequitatem: Whoſoever thou art that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireſt to follow Iuſtice, firſt feare, and love God, that thou mayſt be beloved of God. Thou ſhalt ſhew thou loveſt God, if in imitation of him thou ſeekeſt to profit all, to hurt none. Expect from another what thou haſt done to him.

            </p>
            <p>What ſhould have beene placed in the Front, comes here in the Reare, and that is prudencie, <note place="margin">Prudencie commended in it ſelfe, and him.</note> a vertue which ſerves, meaſures, graces, and crownes all other vertues whatſoever. As a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt precious ſtones ſome are of greater prize then the reſt, and by their preſence impart to them a luſtre: ſo prudencie amongſt all other Vertues, is of greateſt eſteeme in the eyes of all men, as being to the reſt a Guide, a Gage, and an Ornament. As the eye in the body is by all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before the other ſenſes: ſo prudencie in the ſoule is commended above all other perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. In the troope of Vertues ſhe hath the moſt honourable charge. Prudencie gives a meaſure, and a Gage to every other Vertue; for (if not
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:18330:46"/>
meaſur'd, and directed by diſcretion) a needfull Care turns into an utter Deſpaire, a decent grief into Rage and Bitterneſſe, Love into Flattery, Hope into Preſumption, Joy <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nto Wantonneſſe, and a juſt Anger into an immoderate Fury. So that wee may perceive an undiſcreet vertue to be no better then a Vice. This is ſhee that hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver an eye to what is paſt, preſent, and to come, and out of all three picks this advantage, that her Adverſary can never ſurprize her unawares, or take her unprovided. Shee laughs at that u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall ſaying of Fools, <hi>I had not thought.</hi> As in the warres, though the Enemy be farre off, the Watch is ſtill conſtantly ſet: ſo ſhe is alwayes vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant, and hath a ſeverall ward for every blow of Fortune. She is like double-faced <hi>Ianus</hi> looking two ſeverall wayes at one and the ſame time. This all men will readily grant me, that if For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune cauſe a Tempeſt to rage and rore, ſhee ſhall not ſo ſoon ſink him, that fore-ſeeing the ſtorme hath taken in his ſailes, as him, who miſtruſting nothing, beares them all out. Prudencie teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us that in this rolling, tottering World there is nothing ſtable, &amp; that the beſt remedie againſt an evill is the prevention of it. To be briefe, her aſſiſtance is more neceſſary, cleane through all the affaires of this life, then on the Sea is the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Pilot, who knows not how to aſſwage the violence of a ſtorme, nor to appeaſe the fury of the Windes, nor to gaine his deſired Port at his pleaſure; whereas prudencie will for the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:18330:47"/>
moſt part either prevent, or fruſtrate all practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that tend to her ruine. As if there were no Sun, we ſhould live in a perpetuall darkneſſe, for all the comfort, and light the other Stars could afford us: ſo except the beams of this bright, and radiant prudencie reflect on all our actions, and Negotiations, they will appeare dimme and ſordid, notwithſtanding all the light the other Vertues can lend us. This vertue was in ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute with <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> that hee exhorted his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, now ready for the combat, that they ſhould not minde the multitude of their Enemies, but bend all their forces againſt <hi>Epaminondas</hi> their Generall; for hee once ſubdued, all the reſt would in a trice be vanquiſh'd: <hi>For,</hi> ſaid hee, <hi>none but wiſe and prudent men know how to prevent a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat, or obtain a victorie.</hi> This Vertue eminently and ſuperlatively appear'd in all the proceedings of Chriſt himſelf with the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> Nation. When hee had attain'd to the age of twelve yeares, hee ſate in the Temple amongſt the grave Doctours, queſtioning, anſwering, and inſtructing; and the Text witneſſeth, that all who heard him ſtood amazed at his prudent demands and replies. Hee alſo deluded the Prieſts and Elders of the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> Synagogue, by prudently anſwering one queſtion with another. When they aſked him by what power hee did thoſe Miracles? hee demanded of them, <hi>Whence the Baptiſme of</hi> John <hi>was?</hi> When again they demanded of him if he were the Son of God? he replyed, <hi>You ſay that I am.</hi> This pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:18330:47"/>
(next to the Invocation of his Father) was the onely Engine wherewith hee defended himſelf againſt the pernicious plots of this Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Vipers. As no Architecture can come to perfection, without the help of the Compaſſes &amp; the Rule: ſo ſtands it with Human Actions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the aid of prudencie, none of them can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their grace, and accompliſhment. Let a man be maſter of all abilities imaginable, if he be not withall judicious and prudent, to make a right uſe of them, and to produce them in their proper times and places, they will acquire him rather ſhame then glory. If one could have <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Seneca,</hi> without book, and were withall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicious, inconſiderate, &amp; undiſcreet, he would oftener purchaſe laughter then applauſe. <hi>Diodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> (omitting the idle Fables of <hi>Proteus)</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes us that hee was adopted King by the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians,</hi> in that he excell'd all men in Wiſdome, which made him ſo cunning in giving, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king counſell, and in changing it with dexterity when opportunity ſerved, that hence aroſe the Fable, that hee could turn himſelfe into ſo many formes and ſhapes. If in his determinations hee altered any thing, you could not ſo properly ſay he chang'd as hee fitted his minde to the preſent occaſion; as we ſee the hand is the ſame ſtill whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be ſhut or extended. Indeed the minde of a Wiſeman is, as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſayes, like the ſtate of the World above the Moone, where there is no change He alwayes returns home (as it is ſaid of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:18330:48"/>
               <hi>Socrates)</hi> with the ſame countenance hee carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out; and, according to <hi>Epictetus,</hi> is like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe even in his dreames.</p>
            <p>This our incomparable Child of Honour gave ſtrong eſſayes to climbe the ſummity of this vertue, both by diligent reading, and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of all the writings and actions of the wiſe. In his converſation he ever applyed himſelfe to thoſe who had deſervedly gain'd a fame in good Letters, or had acquir'd wiſedome by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; whoſe ſage precepts, and admonitions, hee as greedily dranke in, as a thirſty Traveller doth Water from a cleare fountaine. Theſe he made the mirrour, wherein he daily dreſs'd, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd his mind, which was a Paradiſe into which the Serpent never enter'd, but he receiv'd a ſuddaine repulſe. Two times eſpecially hee made choyſe of, to prepare and examine himſelf, the Morning, &amp; the Evening. In the firſt he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt what was that day to bee done, in the later he cald to minde what that day he had done. To doe good was his fixed reſolution, and when he had the power to doe harme (like the true ſonne of Prudency) he never had the will: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Nature of a foole is, when he hath not the ability, then to have the will to doe miſchiefe, This Vertue was defuſed cleane through all his endeavours, nay through his very habit, geſture, and diſcourſe; which were neither too mimical, too anticke, nor too grave, but ſutable to the modeſty required in ſo greene an Age. Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:18330:48"/>
(which Politicians prophanely call the gift of God) he hated ſo in others, that hee never gave it countenance, nor harbour himſelfe. In his Diſcourſe he warily proportion'd his words to the bigneſſe of the ſubject he ſpake of: in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of a Mariner, that fits his Sayles to the ſmalneſſe or vaſtneſſe of his Veſſell. As ſlender men lightly weare their cloaths looſe, and large, a little to augment their bulke: ſo ſmall wits, who want matter, enlarge themſelves in words; whereas indeed, that ſpeech is beſt which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends moſt ſence in feweſt words; as wee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme that Coyne moſt, which in a ſmall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe includes a great value. Hee was not haſty to ſpeak, or in ſpeaking, but in both prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerv'd a decency. He was very carefull not onely what he vented, but what hee heard, that it reliſhed not of Immodeſty, Levity, or Vice; for he held that, what ever it was, a villany to act, it was alſo a villany to harken to. Hee talked alwayes opportunely, and appoſitively, never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove his knowledge. He derided thoſe who with a great dinne utter'd nothing but high profound <hi>Non-ſence,</hi> reſembling in that the Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe trees, which are great, and tall, but beare no fruit. A viſit given to a wiſe, but ſick man, by one of theſe babling, curious impertinents, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts him more than his diſeaſe. His owne ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, thoſe of his friends, or of the ſtate, he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reveal'd, nor pryed into; for he was ſure he could at any time ſpeake what he had conceal'd,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:18330:49"/>
but he could not conceale what he had once ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. <hi>En la boca ſerada moxca no entra</hi> (ſayes the Spaniſh Proverbe) <hi>Into a mouth cloſed a Flie never enters.</hi> Hee had happily read, or heard, that <hi>Anacharſis</hi> the Philoſopher was accuſtomed to ſleep with his right hand on his mouth, and his left on his ſecrets, being of opinion, that the Tongue more than Concupiſcence needed a bridle. Not to be tedious, I may boldly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe truely, averre that Prudency was the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of his Demeanour, Speech, and Actions, and gave to all of them a Wiſe and ſafe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.</p>
            <p>You ſee, pious Reader, what embelliſhment, what Ornaments his Life, like a ſparkling Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell, <note place="margin">His Death.</note> was ſet with; and I imagine you cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſo faire a beginning could have a foule end. You cannot ſurely be at once ſo ſtupid, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable: If you can, you ſhall quickly be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of your Errour, and ſhall ſee this Sun-ſet, with the ſame glory in which he roſe. Firſt, in his ſickneſſe that led to his death he made uſe of <note place="margin">His Patience.</note> his patience, a Vertue which miraculouſly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes by yielding. As he would not ſhunne his death, ſo he would not haſten it, but uſed all lawfull, and poſſible meanes to prevent it; no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe than the Maſter of a Ship, who when the ſayles are rent aſunder, the Maſt cut downe by the boarde, and a Leake ſprung in the ſhip, yet ſtill labours for life, and leaves no way un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought to preſerve it. But when hee ſaw his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:18330:49"/>
Miſtreſſe, <hi>Nature,</hi> ready to abandon him, and that as well Neceſſity forced, as God cald him hence: then ſelfe-love, the Lifes Jay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour could no longer with-hold him from rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily running into the Armes of Death, who he knew would ſoone uſher him into the imbraces of his Saviour. He beheld Death no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then a Pilot does the Winds and the Sayles, that will bring him to his deſired Haven. He endured the terrible approach, and the furious aſſaults of Death with ſo undaunted a reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a man, and ſo firme unmoved a beliefe of a Chriſtian, that he became at once a pleaſing, and ſad ſpectacle to his friends, who believed he could not ſo patiently undergoe ſuch paine and torments, without the extraordinary aſſiſtance of ſome Beatificall viſion. We ſee many in the darke are afraid of every thing, but the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable light expells all feare: ſo it is for thoſe who are blinded with the Miſt Atheiſme, and Impiety, have caſt before their eyes to doubt, and tremble: ſecurity becomes ſuch as live and dye in the true Light, and are illuſtrated with the beames of Gods favour, as was this Patient of Heaven, who not being curable here, was thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be tranſlated. Before the comming of the Holy Ghoſt upon the Apoſtles, they feared Death, and forſooke their Lord, but when they were once illuminated from above, they undaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly appear'd before Tyrants, and conſtantly ſuffer'd Martyrdome. Having ſent his deſires
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:18330:50"/>
long before to caſt Anchor in Heaven, hee lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gingly expected his owne paſſage with a calme, patient, and contented minde, wherein no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper ever ſtay'd, but as an unwelcome ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. At length when he perceived all his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes were ready to forſake him, being innocently ambitious to retaine to the laſt his knowledge of all things, he ſuddainly by a holy Art drew the vaſtneſſe of his memory into a Compendium, and remembred God onely in whom are all things, in whoſe Fatherly eternall protection we confident, and ſubmiſſively leave him.</p>
            <p>In this bud of Honour two things are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly <note place="margin">Two things to bee lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his Death.</note> to be lamented. Firſt that it dyed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the hand of a Royall Gardner, who meant to underprop and cheriſh it: Secondly, that it ſo ſoone faded.</p>
            <p>All men will confeſſe his infortunity was great in departing this life in the Reigne of a <note place="margin">His infortuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in dying ſo immaturely in the Reigne of ſo gracious a Prince.</note> Prince great in the Union of the Roſes, greater in that of the Lawrells, but greateſt of all in the love of his people. He knowes full well, that full ill it went with man-kind if the Almighty Maker of all things ſhould confine his favour to one onely, and neglect the reſt of Humanity, and therefore as a god on earth (in imitation of of the Heavenly) diſtributes his favours amongſt all his ſubjects, but not <hi>eodem gradu,</hi> becauſe they are not <hi>ejuſdem meriti.</hi> Like the Sunne, he ſtrives to impart the light of his countenance to all, and whither his beames cannot reach, thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:18330:50"/>
his warmth extends. Though all cannot enjoy the honour of his preſence, all are ſharers in the comfort of his benefits. We are not more happy in living, than this brave deceaſed Lord was unfortunate in immaturely dying under ſo gratious a King, diligent in the ſearch after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, and magnificent in rewarding it, who in all probability (upon a proofe made of his faith, and merit) might in him have raiſed his whilome great Houſe to that Height from which Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny unmercifully threw it downe. I ſay to the ſame Height, not the ſame Titles.</p>
            <p>As concerning the immaturity of his Death, <note place="margin">The immatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his Death.</note> I willingly acknowledge the ſuddaine, unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted deprivation of one ſo deare, and ſo hopefull, muſt needs be bitter, and grievous to all thoſe whom blood, friendſhip, or acquaintance had link'd to him. Yet ought they not to grieve immoderately, the ſorrow of a Chriſtian being by Chriſt himſelfe bounded, and confin'd. Wee may deplore the abſence of our departed friends, but we muſt not too much bewayle their deaths, becauſe they are with God. As not to feele ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row in ſad chances is to want ſence; ſo not to beare it with moderation, is to lack underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, ſince it is fit that griefe ſhould rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray a tender then a dejected minde. The effects of our ſorrow muſt not too long out-live the cauſe. We moyſten not the earth with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Waters; they were diſtill'd for nobler ends, either by their Odour to delight us, or
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:18330:51"/>
by their operation to preſerve our health. Our Teares are Waters of too high a price to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digally powred into the duſt of any Graves. But we unwiſely court ſorrow, and as a Lover al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies eſpyes ſomething in his Miſtris that in his opinion exalts her above her Sexe, ſo wee la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to finde out cauſes for our exceſſive griefe, and to prove our preſent loſſe unequall'd, though indeed, it have many paralells. As the light handling of a Nettle makes it ſting us, but the hard griping of it prevents that harme; ſo wee ſhould not ſtroke and cheriſh our griefes, but out of Divinity and Humanity compoſe a probe that may ſearch them to the quicke. Hee who heateth an Iron, takes it not out by that part which the fire hath enflamed, but by that end which remained without: Nor ſhould wee take our afflictions by the wrong end, but if wee can finde any comfort to ariſe from them, wee ſhould diſcreetly lay hold on that. Hee who comes into a Roſary, findes every Roſe guarded with innumerable Thorns, yet he warily gathers the one without being pricked by the other. The moſt bitter accident hath a graine of ſweetneſſe and Conſolation in it, which a wiſe man extracts, and leaves the Gall behind.</p>
            <p>To apply this; out of the ſubitary death of this Noble Gentleman wee may cull many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts. True it is, that Death is ſayd to kill the old by Maturity, and the young by Treachery, and that unripe, untimely ends, are by all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:18330:51"/>
pittied; but if we will harken to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, iſſuing out of the mouths of the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Philoſophers, ſhe will tell us that brevity <note place="margin">Brevity of life to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before Longevity.</note> of Life is to be preferred before longevity. If we will give beliefe to <hi>Seneca,</hi> he will aſſure us that Nature never beſtowed a greater Benefit on man than ſhortneſſe of Life, it being ſo full of Cares, Feares, Dangers, and Miſeries, that Death is become the Common wiſh of all men afflicted. He who dyes ſoone, ſhould no more complaine than he whoſe Navigation in a rough troubled ſea is quickly ended. We ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count not thoſe the beſt trees that have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the rage of many Winters, but thoſe who in the leaſt time have borne the moſt fruit. Not hee who playes longeſt, but ſweetlieſt on an Inſtrument is to bee Commended. Compared with Eternity, the longeſt and the ſhorteſt Life differ not. Life is not a conſtant Fountaine, but a fickle Floud that quickly riſes, and as ſuddainly falls. Some have compared life to a Bird in a Childes hand, which ſometimes flies away before hee can well faſten his hold on it. By the vertue of that Organ wherewith wee firſt behold the ſhine of the ſun, by the defect of the ſame we are brought into the darkneſſe and ſhadow of death. It is ſo, it is ſo, Hee that built this faire Fabricke would have nothing ſtable, and permanent in it but himſelfe. This goodly, rationall, ſubtle creature, Man, above the Stars themſelves, and next to
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:18330:52"/>
God himſelfe in Dignity, able to penetrate into the deepeſt ſecrets of Nature, to obſerve the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the heavens, &amp; to compaſſe both heaven and Earth in a thought, is onely immortall here below by ſucceſſion; Generation being as reſtleſſe as corruption. <hi>The miſtocles</hi> rightly affirmes that no creature is ſo miſerable as Man, in that none but he knows the uſe of life, yet when with great ſtudie and induſtry, hee hath attain'd to that knowledge, he is by death depriv'd both of life and it together. Age brings to us experience in one hand, and Death in the other. <hi>Iuſt were the teares, and ſweet was the Humanity,</hi> ſaith <hi>Pliny, of that Royall and youthful</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Xerxes.</note> 
               <hi>Graecian, who wept to thinke that not one of that glorious immenſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my hee then commanded ſhould ſurvive one Age.</hi> Such a gentle commiſeration of humane frailty made <hi>Anſelme</hi> thus cry out. <hi>O durus Caſus! Heu! quid perdit homo? quid invenit? perdi dit beat itu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinem ad quam factus eſt, &amp; invenit mortem, ad quam factus non eſt. O hard hap! Alas! What did man loſe? What did he finde? Hee loſt the bleſſedneſſe to which he was made, and found death to which he was not made.</hi> Shal then the valiant, &amp; the learned have a harder fate then fools, in ſo ſoon parting with thoſe Crownes which <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Apollo</hi> have placed on their heads? ſhall they ſo ſuddenly be deprived of the comfort of that faire Fame which with bloud, and ſweat, with faſting and watching they have purchas'd? Yes, yes, <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſhall never terrifie the World again with his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:18330:52"/>
nor <hi>Cicero</hi> charme it with his eloquence. The ſword of the one, and the pen of the other have now with their Lords the ſame eternall and unprofitable reſt. Alas, alas, Mans is as brittle as glaſſe, but not ſo conſerveable. As he encreaſes in growth, his life decreaſes. As whether one ſleeps, or wakes in a ſhip under ſaile he is inſenſibly, as it were, carried away towards his intended Port; ſo what ever we are doing, we unawares ſail towards the region of death. Time deals with man Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metically; He firſt addes to his Beauty, and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies his Graces, and then hee ſubſtracts all theſe, and makes a long laſting Diviſion between him and Nature. It were ſtrange, if we ſhould think wee ſhall never arrive there, whither wee are ever going. <hi>Plutarch</hi> writes of creatures in a certain part of the World which are borne in the morning, are in their prime at noon, grow aged towards the evening, and are dead ere night. Had theſe reaſonable ſoules as wee have, they would have alſo the ſame paſſions. They would after our womaniſh cuſtome lament their untimely death who die before noon, eſteeme them happy that live till the evening, and yet bewaile them too who depart at night. Our fond whining were ſeaſonable, and to purpoſe, if it could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the death of our friends, or call them from the dead; but it ſavours of a vain, fooliſh arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant ambition to deſire they ſhould be privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and exempted from the fatall, common condition of Mankinde, ſince wee cannot be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:18330:53"/>
that God hath ſet down a period beyond which Nature her ſelf ſhal not paſſe.

               <hi>ſtinke worſe through a repletion with excrements, which ſurfets of delicious fare have left behinde.</hi> This world is Deaths region, about it as a trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher over all fleſh he rides his circuit. Since then his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming is ſo neceſſary, ſo inevitable, whether he comes in the dawne, the noon, or twilight of life, let us bid him welcome. What ſhould hinder us to doe ſo I cannot tell; ſince as there is no ſhip but in one Voyage or other daſheth not againſt ſome hidden rock, or ſhelf: ſo the moſt happy life is not free from infinite croſſes and diſaſters. <hi>Yet though every man knows the inconveniences &amp; pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils of this life,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Auſtin, and that he muſt once die, yet all men ſeeke to ſhun, and defer the houre of death; not onely the heathen, but they to who believe the reſurrection of the body, and the life everlaſting.</hi> To our reproch the holy Father ſpake this; for though it be no ſhame for a <hi>Gentile</hi> to fear death, whoſe onely ſcope of life is to ſee and be ſeen, to know &amp; be known; yet to a Chriſtian it is, whoſe aime and deſire ſhould be not onely to ſerve God faithfully here, but alſo to raigne gloriouſly with him hereafter. What is neceſſarily to be done, a wiſeman does voluntarily; let us not therefore with the fooliſh Tyrant in <hi>Lucian,</hi> either with tears, prayers, or bribes vainly think to perſwade inexorable Death, but wiſely conſider that wee are neither the firſt, nor the laſt; All have gone before, and muſt follow us. Nay, not a man dies, that hath not at the ſame time many to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany him, who arrive at the houſe of Death by ſeverall waies. Life is a due debt to God and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:18330:54"/>
Nature, as long as we have it, we enjoy a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, when wee are deprived of it wee have no wrong. Let us then daily render it backe to him that gave it, ſince hee is a bad debtour who unwillingly payes. As a Souldier, the ſigne once given, readily obeyes the command of his Generall, and armed at all poynts, followes him through all Dangers, and faceth Death him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: ſo muſt we chearefully obſerve the very Beck of our Heavenly Commander, and through all miſeries and deſtruction it ſelfe make our way to him. Death ſhould be no longer formidable to us, ſince our Redeemer hath taken out his ſting, and hee is now no other then an old toothleſſe Dragon. It is a fooliſh thing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in ſleep, and abhorre Death, ſleepe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely a continuall imitation of it. Hee that ſeriouſly contemplates the priviledges, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages that accompany a Chriſtian Death, will be in love with it. It is the Refuge of the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and the end of all earthly evils. It takes not life from us, but preſents it to the cuſtodie of Eternity. It is not an end but an intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance <note place="margin">Death to a Chriſtian not a puniſhment, but a tribute.</note> of life, nor no longer a puniſhment, but a Tribute, and we are gainers by it. As he who hath a long time layne in a darke dungeon, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond imagination joyfull when he comes to the light: ſo the ſoule when ſhee is freed from the vapours and clouds in which the fleſh involv'd her is raviſh'd with delight. While ſhee is yet in the body, though her ambition reach at Heaven,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:18330:54"/>
yet is ſhee ſtill clogg'd with that heavy maſſe of earth, and cannot ſo nimbly and nobly operate as ſhe would. She may fitly be call'd the Gueſt, and the Body the Hoſt, that makes her pay dearly for her clayie lodging. For if a Magiſtrate be vexed and buſied to ſubdue and pacifie the Rebels of a ſeditious Citie, needs muſt the ſoule be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and afflicted, who hath a harder office aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd her, which is to bridle, and reſtrain the vitious, inordinate, diſſolute affections which are inſeparable adjuncts to her while ſhee hath a conjunction with the body.</p>
            <p>The prerogatives of Death being ſo many, and ſo certaine, let us no longer condole the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe of this our compleatly noble Friend, but congratulate his happy departure hence, and his ſafe arrivall in the Imperiall Heaven. When <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus Iulius</hi> had reported to the <hi>Romans</hi> that hee had ſeene <hi>Romulus,</hi> and that aſſuredly hee was a God, a Wonder it was, ſaith <hi>Livie,</hi> how much they gave credit to this Tale, and how greatly the miſſe of <hi>Romulus,</hi> both amongſt the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and Souldiers, was by this beliefe of his Immortalitie digeſted. Much more ſhould our ſorrow be mittigated by the confidence we have that this our bleſſed Friends ſoule is aſcended to him from whom it deſcended. When Braſſe or Gold is melted to make the Statue of ſome great deſerving Man, wee ſay not that the Mettall is loſt, but dignified: In like caſe when a Body is turn'd into its firſt Principles, Duſt, and Aſhes,

I wil conclude with this double conſolation to all his Honourers. Firſt, that hee died with that matchleſſe comfort, <hi>The love of all men,</hi> and heard yet living, the judgement men would paſſe on him dead, and was, as it were, preſent with Poſterity. Secondly, that whereas here hee ranne a perpetuall hazard, in that hee carried a heavenly Treaſure in an Earthy Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, hee now lives in an unmoved Securitie, and that Treaſure is encloſed in a Magazine to which the Heavens are Walls, and the Angels Warders. It is now high time to cover this ſweet, beautifull iſſue, who with the Roſe and Violet is lay'd downe to ſleepe in the Boſome of his firſt Mother the Earth, and ſhal enjoy, though it may be not ſo ſuddaine, yet as certaine a Spring as they, and which is more, an everlaſting.</p>

               <l>Nor doe we Cypreſſe bring in hope of Bayes</l>
               <l>(As death makes many Poets now a dayes)</l>
               <l>Our teares flow by inſtinct, and a cold froſt</l>
               <l>Seazing our Palſie-joynts told what was loſt</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18330:61"/>
Before the fat all knell, not a dirge ſung,</l>
               <l>Nere a ſad peale of Elegies was rung.</l>
               <l>No bearded wonder, or propheticke flame,</l>
               <l>Vſher'd the ruine of his houſe and name:</l>
               <l>Yet then we melted in a chilling ſweat,</l>
               <l>And every fainting breſt did ſomething threat.</l>
               <l>Not each dayes wonder, ſome ſtrange newes come</l>
               <l>Creeping upon us, like the generall doome;</l>
               <l>And this was <hi>Staffords</hi> death, in his owne fall</l>
               <l>A world of people felt their funerall,</l>
               <l>And loſt a being they nere had: for he</l>
               <l>Writ not a man, but Houſe, or Familie.</l>
               <l>Thus have I ſeene a little ſilken clew</l>

               <l>Compriſed in a palme, but ravel'd out,</l>
               <l>And drawne to lines, the thread will winde about</l>
               <l>Countries or townes. Great ſhade the fate was thine,</l>
               <l>Who by the iſſue of thy Noble line,</l>

               <l>And all thy vertues in ſad weedes doe lye,</l>
               <l>Onely ſpun out into thy memory.</l>
               <l>Thus have we loſt what goodneſſe knew to dwell</l>
               <l>In fleſh and clay, more worth then we dare tell.</l>
