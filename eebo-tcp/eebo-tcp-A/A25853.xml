            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </q>
            <p>This Concluſion contains two parts; One, the Primacy of the Pope; in which all <hi>Catholicks</hi> agree: The other the Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility which the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> attribute to him.</p>
            <p>Nor is the queſtion, concerning that Infallibility, which ſome Divines maintain, and which regards only the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Popes</hi> touching the truths revealed by God in the Holy Scripture and Tradition.</p>
            <p>It is well known what the opinions of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, and School of <hi>Paris</hi> are upon this Subject: and what is to be underſtood by their words <hi>Sententia Pariſienſium,</hi> when one meets with them in the Books, even of <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> upon this matter.</p>
            <p>It is alſo known, that thoſe among ſome modern Doctors, who would be moſt favourable to Popes, as Dr. <hi>Du <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>al;</hi> were nevertheleſs of Opinion, that it is not a point of Faith, that the Pope is Infallible; <hi>Non eſt de Fide ſummum Pontificem eſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibilem;</hi> and that the contrary opinion, is neither erroneous nor raſh; <hi>Non est erroneum neque temerarium temeritate opinionis dicere ſummum pontificem in decernendo errare poſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But theſe ſame Divines how paſſionate ſoever they were, to exalt the authority of the Sovereign Biſhops, do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as a thing certain, unqueſtionable, and agreed on by all Catholicks, that in matters of fact, they are not infallible, but may be deceived, and ſo really have been in ſundry occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <hi>All Catholicks are of Agreement,</hi> ſayes Cardinal Bellarmin, <hi>that the Pope, acting as Pope, with advice of his Council, nay even of a general Council, may be deceived in particular affairs, depending on the information and atteſtation of Men.</hi> And, applying this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Maxime to a particular fact, altogether conformable to that of <hi>Janſenius,</hi> to wit, whether the Hereſie of the <hi>Monothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> were contain'd in the Letters of <hi>Honorius,</hi> as the VI general Council, confirmed by ſo many Popes, had determined: <hi>A Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>that is a lawful one, cannot erre in the definition of dogmatical points of Faith, wherein the</hi> VI <hi>Council likewiſe was</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:65318:4"/>
               <hi>free from error; but it may erre in queſtions of Fact. Generale Conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium legitimum non poteſt errare, ut neque erravit hoc ſextum, in dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matibus Fidei definiendis: tamen errare poteſt in queſtionibus de Facto,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Cardinal <hi>Baronius</hi> ſayes the ſame, upon the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the ſixth Oecumenical Council. <hi>The Condemnation, even of General Councils, is not received with ſo much rigour, in what concerns mens perſons, and their writings: For no man doubts, but that whoever he be, he may be deceived in matters of Fact: in which occaſion, the ſaying of St.</hi> Paul <hi>is appliable, we can do nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst truth, but for truth. In his enim quae</hi> facti <hi>ſunt, unumquemque contingere poſſe falli, nemini dubium eſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All other Divines, even the more wedded to the intereſt of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> have hitherto contain'd themſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in theſe bounds. But the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> will neither admit Bounds nor Examples in their exceſſes and extravagancie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. It is not enough for them to make the Pope infallible, in the manner as ſome other Divines have done; they muſt needs have it, that <hi>Jeſuus Chriſt</hi> hath given him the <hi>ſame</hi> infallibility, which Himſelf enjoyed here on earth: and as this infallibility of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt</hi> reached to all things, and not only to matters reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but alſo to ſuch, as till then had not been reveal'd, and which he revealed by uttering them; ſo they will have the Pope to become infallible, not only in propoſing to the Church the truths compriſed in Divine Revelation, but alſo certain facts, which we are ſure were never revealed by God: as, whether ſuch Propoſitions be found in a Book compos'd in the 17<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> AGE.</p>
            <p>Theſe are not conſequences drawn by others out of their Doctrine; They themſelves infer them, and make them paſſe for Catholick Aſſertions, according to the Title of their Concluſions. <hi>There is then in the Church an infallible Judge of controverſies of Faith, even out of a General Council, as well for questions of right, as of fact.</hi> And that we may not doubt of their meaning by <hi>queſtions of Fact,</hi> though the word it ſelf <hi>of Fact,</hi> taken in oppoſition to that of <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Right,</hi> doth ſufficiently clear it; they alleage for an <hi>example,</hi> and a <hi>conſequence</hi> of this new infallibility of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> communicated to the Pope;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65318:4"/>
that after the foreſaid Conſtitutions, one may beleive with <hi>Divine Faith</hi> that <hi>Janſenius</hi> his book is heretical, and that the five Propoſitions are truly this Authors. <hi>

            <p>Behold the Propoſition which they publickly advance in the face of the greateſt City of the World: nor will it be amiſſe to take notice of the origin and date thereof: For theſe ſame men that now ſo boldly maintain it, had for ſome time agoe laid the ſeeds of it in their other writings: and it was eaſily diſcernable that their whole conduct was to be built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this error. They had ſeverally expoſed the Inferences in one place, and the Principles in an other; but ſtill with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain windings, and intricacy of words, that might as occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſerved, be a cloak to them.

            <p>Let the whole Church then hear and take notice, that the 12 of <hi>December</hi> in the year 1661. was the day, on which the Jeſuits brought to light this monſtrous opinion, whereof they had been ſo long in labour: that this was the day, on which they propoſed, as a Catholick aſſertion, <hi>that the Pope ſpeaking out of his Chair, hath the ſame infallibilitie with Jeſus Chriſt, not only in questions of Right, but alſo in thoſe of Fact; and conſequently that one may believe with Divine Faith, that the five propoſitions are the opinions of Janſenius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not conceived needful, My Lords, to uſe many words, to make appear, that there is not here a ſimple Error, nor a ſimple Hereſie, but a Source of Errors, and as one may ſay, a General Hereſie, which overthrows all Religion.</p>
            <p>For your Lordſhips know, that the firſt and principal ground of Chriſtian Religion, is this, that our Faith doth not depend on the word of Men, but on the word of God, who is truth it ſelf: that this is it which makes it inconcuſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and wholly Divine; whereas it would be purely humane, did it rely upon any Authority leſſe than That of God: or that we could not bear the like Teſtimony to our ſelves,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65318:5"/>
which St. <hi>Paul</hi> did to the Chriſtians of <hi>Theſſalona<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ly is. <hi>Non ut verbum hominum, ſed ſicut eſt vere, verbum Dei. All whatſoever is comprehended under the notion of Faith</hi> (ſaith St. Bernard) <hi>is founded upon the ſolid truth, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded us by the Oracles of God, confirmed by miracles, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated by the Child-bearing of a <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgin, by the bloud of our Redeemer, and the glory of Jeſus raiſed from the dead. Totum quod in Fide est certâ ac ſolidâ veritate ſubnixum, oraculis &amp; miraculis divinitus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſum, ſtabilitum, &amp; conſecratum partu Virginis, ſanguine Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toris, gloriâ Reſurgentis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whoever then ſaith, A thing not revealed nor atteſted by God, (as, that certain Propoſitions are truly ſuch an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of theſe later ages) is an object of Divine Faith, becauſe the Pope hath declared it; either eſtabliſhes for the ground of Faith, an authority purely human, and the word of a man, which is as much as to overthrow Faith; or makes a God of the Pope, and of his word, a divine word, and Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; which is not only an Hereſie, but a horrible impietie, and a kinde of Idolatry.</p>
            <p>For Idolatrie doth not conſiſt onely in giving to man the name of God, but much more in aſcribing to him the attributes proper to God, and the honour which is due only to him. Now this ſubmiſſion of our underſtandings and intellective faculties, implied in each Act of Faith; is nothing elſ than the adoration which we exhibite to the primary Truth: and ſo whoever pays it to the word of Man, what rank ſoever he holds in the Church; whoever profeſſes he believes a thing with Divine Faith, on no other motive then becauſe a Man hath ſaid it; places a Man in the Throne of God, transferres the honour due only to the Creator, to a Creature, and, for as much as lies in him, makes a kinde of Idol of the Vicar of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that, my Lords which will give you a greater horror of this Impiety, is this, that the Authors thereof imagin'd they ſhould be able to foſter it, under favour of the reſpect, which all the Catholicks bear the Pope; and that no man would
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65318:5"/>
have the boldneſs to oppoſe it, for fear of incurring his diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; whereas on the contrary, could any one commit a greater outrage againſt the firſt Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, then to imagine he could be honoured by a Blaſphemy ſo injurious to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> that it could be pleaſing to him to be made equall to his Maſter, by ſharing with him the ſame Infallibility which he poſſeſſeth, and that men ſhould yield to his words that Supream Worſhip of Divine Faith, which is due to God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</p>
            <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> and S. <hi>Barnabe,</hi> perceiving the people went about to give them the ſame honours which they were wont to pay to their falſe Gods, tore in pieces their garments, thereby to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the extream diſpleaſure which they reſented; and caſt themſelves into the midſt of the Aſſembly to hinder it: And we may with reaſon believe, that the Pope himſelf, were he truly advertiſed of this horrible exceſs, would not fail to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy his whole Authority to ſuppreſs theſe profane worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and would abhor it as a crime able to cauſe the loſs of himſelf in the ſight of God, to give way to the leaſt compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in ſo deteſtable a flattery. He would with trembling re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on the juſt vengeance of God, upon that laſt King of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> for only ſuffering the tumultuary acclamations of a giddie brain'd people, who, hearing him ſpeak, cryed out, It was the voice of a God, and not of a man; <hi>Dei voces &amp; non hominis:</hi> For the Scripture teacheth us that immediatly the Angel of our Lord ſtroke him, becauſe he had not given to God the honor due unto him: <hi>Confertim autem percuſſit cum, Angelus Domini, eo quod non dediſſet honorem Deo.</hi> And yet how much leſſe criminal was the flattery of that people, then this of the <hi>Jeſuites;</hi> theirs might have paſſed for a ſudden tranſport of joy, not regulated by reaſon; and ſometimes the Holy Scripture it ſelf gives the Name of God to Supream Judges and Princes: But here is given to the Pope deliberate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon a laid Defign, and by way of eſtabliſhing a Dogmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Aſſertion of Theologie, not an empty and inſignificant name, but one of the moſt glorious Attributes of God, and moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable to a creature, to wit, that his Word ſhould have entailed upon it ſuch an <hi>infallibility,</hi> as to deſerve that ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65318:6"/>
of divine Faith, which cannot without Idolatry be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to any but the firſt and ſoveraign Verity.</p>
            <p>For the like cannot be ſaid in this queſtion, which thoſe who maintain the Popes infallibility in matters of Faith, are wont to anſwer, That in beleeving the deciſions of the Pope, they do not build their Faith on the word of a man; becauſe he doth but propoſe what hath been formerly revealed by God in Holy Scripture and Tradition, and ſo their faith relies ſtill on the Word of God. Nothing I ſay, like this can be applied to the matter in hand, in regard whereof the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> pretend, That the Pope is as infallible as Jeſus Chriſt, and that his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion is an Object of Divine Faith. For when the Pope ſhall propoſe a fact of the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Age; as that certain Heretical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions were taught by an Author of thoſe times; it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be pretended that he propoſes a matter revealed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or Tradition: He may well ſay, I judge it to be thus; but he cannot ſay, God hath revealed it. He may ſpeak as from himſelf, but he cannot ſay, God hath ſpoken; <hi>Dominus locutus eſt:</hi> And, as it is a man that ſpeaks, and not God, all they who hold that one may beleeve with divine Faith, a deciſion of this nature, do moſt viſibly commit the like abominable exceſs, which that blinded people did, by crying out with them, <hi>Voces Dei &amp; non hominis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And albeit the Popes piety be a ſufficient Antidote to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve him from being poiſoned with this ſacrilegious opinion, nevertheleſs, they who preſent this poiſon unto him cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe themſelves from being as guilty towards him, as were thoſe wretched Sycophants towards their King, of whoſe death, they were the cauſe, by their impious flatteries. For a man is not then only eſteemed a murderer either of the ſoul or body, when effectively he takes away the life of one or the other, but alſo when he lays a cauſe, which of its own nature is ſufficient to work the death of either, though the effect do not follow. So S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> calls thoſe Chriſtians Parricides, who through fear of perſecution, offered up to the Idols their ſucking In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants; becauſe although they could not really deprive them of the life of Grace, which they had received in Baptiſm, by this Idolatry whereunto they were in no ſort conſenting, as S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:65318:6"/>
remarks; they did notwithſtanding what lay in them, to bereave them of it. <hi>In illis quidem interfectionem non faciunt, ſed quantum in ipſis eſt, interfectores fiunt.</hi> Flatter not your ſelves, ſaith S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> ſpeaking to thoſe who give occaſion to others of committing ſin, upon account that your brother is not dead by the ſcandal you gave him; it is true, he is not dead, and yet you are murderers: <hi>Et ille vivit, &amp; tu homicida es.</hi> One may ſay the ſame to the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> in reſpect of the Pope, whom they go about to poiſon with ſo peſtiferous an opinion: <hi>Non ſibi blandiantur, quia ille non eſt mortuus, &amp; ille vivit, &amp; iſti homicidae ſunt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it is not the Pope only, before whoſe feet they caſt this ſtumbling block, but even the generality of the faithful, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading them to build their belief on the word of a man, and to ſubmit their judgements thereunto, as to the firſt Verity, which as hath been ſhewed, cannot be done without a kinde of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry: Inſomuch that the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> are near upon the ſame impiety with thoſe Hereticks, who would have Divine honours exhibited to the Bleſſed Virgin; for, as the true reſpect and veneration due to her, as the moſt holy of Creatures, took not any thing off from the crime of thoſe Hereticks and their followers; even ſo the reverence which all the faithful ought to bear to the Head of the Church, will in no ſort exempt them from a heavy ſin before almighty God, if through the deceit of the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> they give unto the words of a man how emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ſoever he may be in the Church, that ſoveraign difference of divine Faith, which cannot without impiety be given to any thing but the Word of God himſelf.</p>
            <p>Worldly men make ſmall accompt of theſe kind of ſins, becauſe, being wholy buried in fleſh and blood, none but groſſe and material Objects make Impreſſion on them. Deluded de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votes permit themſelves to be eaſily carried away with theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes; becauſe they imagin it to be a part of their falſe Piety, to imbrace blindly whatever contibutes to the honour and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of thoſe things and perſons, for which they ought to have a reſpect, and from this root are ſprung all thoſe opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which they call <hi>pious,</hi> without ever examining whether they be true or falſe: as if a falſity could be the object of piety,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65318:7"/>
or that God, who is truth, could be honoured with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Sacrifice of a Lie. But you, My Lord, know that all thoſe who have been nouriſhed with the true ſpirit of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, make a far different judgement hereof: they equally hate a lie, to whoſe advantage ſoever it redound, whether of the <hi>Pope,</hi> or the <hi>Bleſsed <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgin,</hi> or of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf: which yet would a little ſtartle a man to hear, had not St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly taught it: For this Holy Father fears not to maintain <hi>that, if a lye or calomny, which one makes uſe of to take away the temporal life of Man, be a deteſtable crime; That is yet a far greater, which tends to the destruction of his ſpiritual life; as all manner of lyes in matter of Religion, even though employed in giving falſe prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> For which reaſon, the ſame Father ſays, <hi>that a Chriſtian would commit a notorious folly, who would not rather expoſe himſelf to all manner of indignities, even thoſe that ſtrike the greateſt horror into pious Souls; then condeſcend to the inſolence of a perſon, that would force him to corrupt the holy Goſpel, thereby to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow falſe praiſes upon Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since then, according to the Judgement of this great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it would be a crime of abomination to give falſe honours to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf, who being God, is above all our praiſe and honours; how much more abominable is it, to give a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Man, invironed with infirmities, as the Scripture ſayes, the honours that appertain to God alone? But into what a labirinth of errors will not men run headlong, if one grant them the freedom to cloak their capricious fancies with the mantle of piety? For if opinions muſt be born with, how falſe ſoever they be, becauſe a falſe piety judges them pious; and if this be a plauſible reaſon to exempt Popes from the common defects of humane nature, that one may piouſly believe, that God, having entruſted them with the Government of his Church, will have a care to preſerve them from falling into defects prejudicial to the good thereof; as the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> from this ground conceive they have a right to inveſt the Pope in the ſame ſtate of <hi>infallibility</hi> with <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> even in matters of Fact, when they propoſe them to the whole Church: Why may not others lay claim to the ſame right, of attributing to him the ſame impeccability which <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> had, in all ſuch
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65318:7"/>
affairs as concern the Government of the Church, and the Functions of his Soveraign Pontificate? Why ſhall this latter opinion be leſſe pious, than the former? doth it not appear more advantageous to the Church, that the Head thereof ſhould be in this ſort impeccable, then that he ſhould be infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible in matters of Fact? And have not an infinity of Souls, redeem'd with the Sacred Blood of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> received dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges incomparably greater, by the evil <hi>Government</hi> of ſome Popes, then they can poſſibly receive by their want of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding or due attention in the peruſal of a particular Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</p>
            <p>Some one that ſhould have lived in the firſt ages of the Church, catching hold of theſe ſeeming conveniences of mans weak underſtanding, would he not have thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf well grounded to aſſert.</p>
            <p>That God would never permit the ſeat of St. <hi>Peter</hi> to be poſſeſt, for the ſpace of almoſt an Age together, by perſons moſt unworthy of that dignity; As <hi>Card. Baronius</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges with grief to have hapened, during the far greater part of the tenth Age, by the power of the <hi>Marques</hi> of <hi>Toſcany,</hi> who tyraniſing, what with arms, what with mony, over the Clergy and people of <hi>Rome,</hi> cauſed them to enthrone in St. <hi>Peters</hi> Chair, Men not only vicious in their own perſons, but alſo notoriouſly dammageable to the Church; into which they brought moſt horrible diſorders; as that in particular of <hi>John</hi> the Tenth, whereof <hi>Baronius</hi> ſadly complains, who made an Infant of five years old Archbiſhop of <hi>Rheimes;</hi> on which the Cardinal makes this reflexion: <hi>Tantum nefas, quo Iura omnia Eccleſiaſtica ſauciantur, ejus pontificis authoritate intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductum, quem infamis faeminae infami operâ in Petri ſolium in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſiſſet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Would he not have believed, that God Almighty would never have ſuffered, the Vicar of Him, who made that ſolemn Proteſtation, that his Kingdom was not of this World; to attempt the diſpoſing of Temporal Kingdoms; to take them from ſome, and confer them on Others; as <hi>Julius</hi> the ſecond did That of <hi>Navarre,</hi> which, to the prejudice of our Kings, the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> poſſeſſe upon me no other title, than a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65318:8"/>
guift of the <hi>Pope,</hi> in taking it from its lawful King?</p>
            <p>Would he not have thought, that God would never have permitted Schiſme to have crept even into the Chair of Unity; in ſuch ſort, that the Church for almoſt 40 years ſhould not have been able to diſcern its true, from its falſe Paſtour; groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the oppreſſion of two Mercenaries, ſtrugling for the right Title, and agreeing only in this joynt deſign, to keep the Church in this diſmal diviſion; as in effect it happened a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the end of the 14<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> Age, whilſt one of theſe <hi>Anti-popes</hi> kept his ſeat at <hi>Avignon,</hi> the other at <hi>Rome?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Would he not have thought, that God would never have permitted, that he, whoſe principal charge it is to keep all Chriſtians in Unity, ſhould by raſh and precipitate excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications, be the Cauſe, that whole Kingdoms ſhould fall off from the Communion of the Church; whereby an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of Souls ſhould miſerably ſuffer ſhipwrack againſt the Rocks of Schiſme and Hereſie; as it happened to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>England,</hi> by the precipitancy of <hi>Clement</hi> the Seventh; as Cardinal <hi>Peron</hi> moſt pregnantly repreſented to <hi>Paul the fifth,</hi> to keep him from falling into a like overſight in the cauſe of the <hi>Venetians;</hi> adding the example of <hi>Leo</hi> the Tenth in regard of <hi>Germany,</hi> and remonſtrating to him, <hi>That he ought to conſider, he was then in the ſame Criſis, and at the ſame point, in which Leo the tenth was the ruine of Catholick Religion in Germany; in which Clement the ſeventh deſtroyed It in England, in which Clement the eighth preſerved It in France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is certain, that, to confine our diſcourſe to what may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear advantageous to the Church, and to what we (according to our weak underſtanding) would be apt to judge fitting to be done; had any of thoſe that appear the wiſeſt among Men, been admitted in to the Council of God, when he was caſting the models of his Church; they would all have concurred in this judgement, that it would be in no ſort expedient, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit thoſe who were to ſupply his place upon earth, to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to diſorders ſo oppoſite to the duty of their Charge, and ſo prejudicial to the Souls of Men, committed to their conduct<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But the Counſels of God are intirely different from thoſe of Men; and he was pleaſed out of his inſcrutable judgements
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65318:8"/>
by the ſucceeding events, quite to confound our pretended wiſdome. For he permitted all that, which we would have conceiv'd he ought to have prevented: So that Perſons truly pious ought to be convinced, by ſo many deplorable exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, of this important verity, that God would not have the firm ſubſiſtance of his Church depend on the Saintity, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, or clear-ſightedneſſe of any one ſingle perſon, though he were the Head and Soveraign Paſtor of it. This is the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reflection which <hi>Cardinal Baronius</hi> makes upon the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders of the 10<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> 
               <hi>Age:</hi> To the end, ſayes he, that God might make appear that his Church was not the contrivance of Man, but an Inſtitute purely divine, it was neceſſary he ſhould ſhew, that the vices of bad Popes, ſhould never be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to deſtroy It: as Kingdomes often are overthrown by the vicious lives of their Kings. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t enim Deus ſignificaret eandem ſuam Eccleſiam nequaquam humanum eſſe figmentum, ſed plane di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinum inventum, oportuit oſtendiſſe eam nequaquam pravorum Antiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titum operá perdi poſſe, &amp; ad nihilum redigi; ſicut de aliis diverſarum gentium regnis &amp; bene ſtatutis Rebus-publicis fastum conſtat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is the ſame caſe of this kind of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> which by a new and unheard-of error the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> grant to the Pope: which God hath permitted to be diſproved by ſo many evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent examples, that not any Divine can give credit to it, without condemning himſelf of formal Hereſie; for if all the deciſions of Popes, touching matters of Fact, were as many Articles of Faith, there not being one able Divine, that doth not impugne ſome one of them, there would not be one that did not impugne a point of Faith.</p>
            <p>For example, who is there now a dayes that doth not eſteem the Letters imputed to the firſt Popes, not only not to be Theirs, but contrariwiſe, a Rapſody collected by ſome For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and Impoſtor. And notwithſtanding both <hi>Pope Nicholas</hi> commanded the Biſhops of <hi>France</hi> to receive them, and his Succeſſors inſerted them into the book of <hi>Decretals,</hi> which by their Apoſtolical authority they propoſed to ſerve for a rule to the whole Church, wherein they ſpeak, at leaſt, as much out of their Chair, as in their ordinary <hi>Bulls.</hi> How then can one, without Impiety, believe, that theſe letters are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65318:9"/>
as now all the ableſt Church-men do, even the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits</hi> themſelves, if there be an obligation to hold the ſame In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibilitie in the <hi>Popes,</hi> as in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> even in matters of Fact? would the infallibility of Chriſt permit that one ſhould propoſe to the Church falſe pieces inſtead of true ones?</p>
            <p>There are ſcarce any matters of Fact of more importance to the Church, then to know whether a Council be General or no, whether Lawful or illegittimate. Nevertheleſſe, did the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> become Heretick, for not acknowledging the Council of <hi>Florence</hi> to be Oecumenical, notwithſtanding all the <hi>Bulls</hi> of <hi>Eugenius</hi> the fourth, and all his declarations prefixed at the head of this Council, to oblige the whole world to receive it as a General one? Did the Cardinal of <hi>Lorraine</hi> fall into Hereſie, when he openly declared to <hi>Pope Pius</hi> the fourth, his, and the whole Kingdome of <hi>France's</hi> opinion on this ſubject, in the following tearms: <hi>For as much as concerns the last of the Titles to be given to our Holy Father, taken out of the Council of Florence; I cannot deny but that I am a French man, bred up in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity of Paris, in which it is the common Tenet, that the authority of a Council is above the Pope, and all that bold the contrary are cenſured as Hereticks: That in France the Council of Conſtance is held Oecumenical in all its parts: That they adhere to That of Baſile, and hold That of Florence neither for a Lawful nor a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral One: and it were an eaſier work to kill all French men, then to draw them from their ſaid perſwaſion.</hi> This Letter which the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> writ to his Secretary at <hi>Rome,</hi> to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the 4<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> is to be ſeen in the collection of Memorials concerning the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> publiſhed by the deceaſed Mr. <hi>Du Puis,</hi> and printed by <hi>Cramoiſi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During the firſt diſagreement betwixt Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> the 4<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> and the Council of <hi>Baſile,</hi> he put forth a moſt authentick <hi>Bull,</hi> by which he declared that he transferr'd this Council to <hi>Bolog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> and that all thoſe who ſhould maintain this Tranſlation was juſt and lawful, were both out of the Truth and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faith. <hi>Fuit igitur a Baſilienſi civitate legitima pro tunc noſtra Concilii diſſolutio, &amp; aſſerentes contra ſunt penitus ab omni veritate &amp; fide Catholica alieni.</hi> All which notwithſtanding the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Council of <hi>Baſile,</hi> maintaining that this Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65318:9"/>
was injuſt and invalid, <hi>Eugenius</hi> was forced by another <hi>Bull</hi> equally authentick, to acknowledg that the ſaid Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was in effect null, and that the Council had been duely held from its beginning to that very time. Both theſe <hi>Bulls</hi> are to be ſeen in <hi>Raynald;</hi> the firſt in the year 1433. the other in the year 1434. Now, ſhall the one and the other of theſe <hi>Bulls</hi> be Articles of Faith? and ſhall we be obliged to believe that the ſame Council was at the ſame time, an unlawful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticle, and a Lawful Synod of the whole Church, aſſembled in the name of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>The ſame <hi>Raynald</hi> makes mention of an other <hi>Bull</hi> of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genius</hi> the 4<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> againſt the Cardinal of <hi>Arles</hi> who preſided over the Council of <hi>Baſile;</hi> where he is called <hi>Iniquitatis Alumnus, atque perditionis filius.</hi> If the voice of Popes, in the judgements which they make of perſons in their <hi>Bulls,</hi> ought to be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as infallible as that of <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> we ſhould be obliged to look upon this Cardinal as a moſt wicked perſon: but what if God hath judged otherwiſe, and if, from obliging us to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor him as a <hi>Child of Iniquity, and a Son of Perdition,</hi> he would have us bear reſpect and veneration to him, as one of the Bleſſed, confirming his Saintity by publick Miracles, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized by an other Pope, to wit, <hi>Clement</hi> the Seventh, who by an authentick <hi>Bull</hi> has enrolled him in the number of the Bleſſed, declaring, not that he did penance after having been a Son of Iniquity, but that <hi>he had ever a celeſtial, chast, and imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate life;</hi> as it is to bee ſeen in the <hi>Bull</hi> of his Beatification, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported at length by <hi>Ciaconius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe few examples may ſufficiently ſhew the falſity of the Jeſuits pretenſion. But without ſeeking further, the very Authors themſelves, of this new Doctrine, fall into Hereſie, by the undeniable ſequele of their error. For in theſe very ſame Concluſions, they maintain, that <hi>Pope Honorius,</hi> in his Letters taught nothing but what was moſt conſonant to the Catholick Faith, touching the two wills, and two operations in Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Duas in Chriſto voluntates &amp; operationes fuiſſe profitemur; nec aliud a nobis ſenſit Honorius dum operationem Chriſti unicam eſſe ſcripſit.</hi> Now, if it be a point of Faith, as the Jeſuits pretend, that the Book of <hi>Janſenius</hi> is Heretical, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65318:10"/>
the five Propoſitions are his, becauſe two Popes have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed it, and that one ought to conſider what they ſay with the ſame regard as if Jeſus Chriſt had ſaid it; with how much more reaſon may one ſay the ſame of the letters of Pope <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norius,</hi> which were both ſtrictly examined, condemned and burnt by the Authority of a General Council of the whole Church, in which the Pope preſided by his Legats, and which in this very point was confirmed by two following General Councils, and by a great number of Popes? For if ever Popes ſpeak out of their chair, it is then chiefly when they ſpeak in General Councils, and in the confirmation of them by their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical power.</p>
            <p>And ſo conſequently one cannot doubt, but that <hi>Leo</hi> the ſecond ſpoke out of his Chair, when in divers Letters which he wrote in confirmation of the ſixth Oecumenical Council, he in particular ratified the Condemnation of <hi>Honorius,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing an <hi>Anathema</hi> againſt him, <hi>becauſe in ſtead of inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Church</hi> [theſe are his words] <hi>by the Doctrine of Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Tradition, he ſuffered it to be defiled by a profane corruption. Qui hanc Apoſtolicam Eccleſiam non Apoſtolicâ Traditionis do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinâ luſtravit, ſed profanâ traditione immaculari permiſit.</hi> And conſequently, if, when the Popes ſpeak <hi>out of their chair,</hi> of what matter ſoever they ſpeak, whether of right, or of Fact, they injoy the ſame Infallibility with <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and that all they ſo pronounce is an Article of Faith; it ought to be a point of Faith that the Letters of <hi>Honorius</hi> are Heretical, and he that denies it, eſpecially after having aſſerted this General Maxime, bears in his forehead the moſt notorious mark of an Heretick, according to S. <hi>Paul,</hi> which is, to be condemned by his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per judgement.</p>
            <p>Nor will it ſerve, to have recourſe to the pretended falſify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Acts of the ſixth Council, and of the letters of <hi>Leo</hi> the ſecond; For as this pretenſion is both unſuſtainable, ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous and extravagant, (as in the laſt Aſſembly of the Clergy, the Biſhops even moſt addicted to the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) if there were no other then this poor evaſion to excuſe men from beleeving with Divine Faith, that <hi>Honorius</hi> was juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65318:10"/>
anathematiz'd, and his Letters legally condemned, as full of Hereſies; one muſt needs have renounced all common ſenſe, to make any other judgement of this Pope, or not to hold his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for heretical.</p>
            <p>But, as it is the property of Error to deſtroy it ſelf, the ſame perſon, that by this new Opinion of the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged of neceſſitie to maintain theſe Letters of <hi>Honorius</hi> to be Heretical; by the ſame principle would be obliged to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the falſity of his own opinion, For how could he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that all the Popes wer indued with this infallibility of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt</hi> ſpeaking <hi>out of their chair;</hi> ſeeing <hi>Honorius</hi> fell into an error, in a conjecture where it is hard to conceive how he ſhould not ſpeak <hi>out of his chair, ſince he ſpoke as Judge of</hi> controverſies of Faith, for the adjuſting the greateſt variance that then raigned in the Church, and which had divided all the Patriarks of the Eaſt. And nevertheleſs, without inſiſting on the judgement of the Sixth Council, and ſuppoſing, which yet is moſt abſurd, that the Acts of it were corrupted; how can any one pretend that <hi>Honorius</hi> in this occaſion, was aſſiſted with the Infallibility of Jeſus Chriſt, ſince having by his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters approved the letter of <hi>Sergius</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> either he underſtood it rightly, and then he fell into an Error of right, by approving an heretical Opinion of one only Will in Jeſus Chriſt, which he muſt have acknowledged to have been contained in the letter of <hi>Sergius:</hi> Or elſe he miſ-underſtood the ſaid letter, taking in a Catholike ſence, that which <hi>Sergius</hi> writ in an heretical one, in which caſe he muſt needs have erred at leaſt in a matter of Fact.</p>
            <p>So that the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> can in no ſort avoid being Heretikes, for if it be an hereſie, as queſtionleſs it is, to aſcribe to the Popes, ſpeaking <hi>out of their chair,</hi> the ſame <hi>infallibility</hi> which <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> hath, as well in matters of right, as of fact, in ſuch ſort that their deciſion even in matters of Fact, may be believed by divine Faith, then they muſt needs be Hereticks, becauſe they are engaged to maintain not an hereſie only, but a blaſphemy: And if they pretend this opinion is true, they are likewiſe Heretikes, becauſe they impugn faith, by impugning the deciſion of ſo many Popes and General Councels touching the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65318:11"/>
of <hi>Honorius,</hi> whom, according to their erroneous Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, one is bound to beleeve by divine Faith, to have been moſt juſtly condemned, ſince it was by the ſentence of Judges, as infallible, both in matters of right, and of fact, as Jeſus Chriſt himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords,</hi> I dwell too long upon the refutation of ſo viſible a folly, but permit me to lay before you one other pernicious conſequence thereof. Your Lordſhips have ſeen the deſign of their Concluſions, and how glorious a Title they prefix before them: <hi>Aſſertiones Catholicae contra ſaeculorum omnium praeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puas Haereſes.</hi> What can a man rationally conceive, when he ſees what Doctrines (in purſuance of that Title) they oppoſe to theſe hereſies, but that their meaning is to obtrude them upon us for Catholick truths, maintained by the Church againſt He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, and which we are bound to embrace under pain of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, and of falling off from the Communion of the Church. Wherefore according to the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> the Catholike Church can never receive the <hi>Grecians</hi> back into Communion, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unite its members cut off by ſo deplorable a Schiſm, otherwiſe then by obliging them to confeſs that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> hath given to the Popes the ſame infallibility which he himſelf had, in all they propoſe to the whole Church, even particular Facts. And as all Heretikes of theſe latter Ages have embraced the Error of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> touching the Primacy of the Holy Seat; ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe neither can we open the Church doors to any of them, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on other terms then by extorting from them a profeſſion of this new Article of Faith.</p>
            <p>But admitting the Church ſhould not tye them to ſuch hard meaſure, yet what a World of Obſtacles are by this opinion caſt in the way of their converſion? What ſcandall doth it not give them? What a fair pretext doth it afford their Miniſters, to decry the Catholick Church in their Sermons to their abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed flock, and render it odious and contemptible, and confirm them in their ancient reproach and calumny, ſo often caſt upon Catholicks of equalling the Pope with God almighty?</p>
            <p>It is well known that this was the principal Engine to work ſo many people to a revolt from the Church. Is it poſſible, that even Religious perſons ſhould concur with them in ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitious
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65318:11"/>
a deſign, and furniſh them with armes to fight againſt us, giving them a juſt occaſion to look upon the ſubmiſſion which all faithful Chriſtians yield to the Pope, as an inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable yoak impoſed on their conſciences, even in matters that no ways concern the Catholick Faith, nor whereof the knowledg doth in any ſort contribute to Salvation.</p>
            <p>This is it, <hi>My Lords,</hi> that hath chiefly forced us to ſpeak in this <hi>ranconter:</hi> It was abſolutely neceſſary that Catholick Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines ſhould make all haſt to cry out againſt this impiety, leſt theſe uncircumciſed ſhould take occaſion to inſult over the Hoſts of the living God: We were obliged to prevent them, that it might appear to all the World, that theſe exceſſes were no leſſe deteſted in the Catholick Church, out of the love of truth, then they ſeemed to deteſt them upon the accompt of juſtifying their guilty ſeparation.</p>
            <p>But if, to have expoſed their complaints to the publick, be enough to acquit Divines of the duty incumbent on them; it will not ſuffice for the honour of the Church, and an entire re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of this ſcandal, that they alone ſhould ſpeak in this occaſion. 'Tis your part, <hi>My Lords,</hi> who ought to be inflamed with a pious zeal for the purity of Chriſtian Doctrine, whereof you are the Depoſitaries; for the ſafety of Souls, whereof you are the Spiritual Fathers; for the Sanctity of the Church, whereof you are the Bridegrooms; for the honour of <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> whoſe chief Miniſters you are; to conſider before Almighty God, what ſervice you owe him, in an occaſion of this importance, where the Faith of the Church is violated by a capital error that ſtrikes at the very roots thereof, where the Faithful are in danger to be poyſoned by an opinion, that tends to change into Idolatry the veneration which they owe to their Soveraign Paſtor; where the Church is profaned by an impiety, that diſhonours and expoſes it to the outrages of its enemies; and finally where <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is horribly blaſphemed by a Sacrilegious parity, which they endeavour to eſtabliſh betwixt his ſacred words, and thoſe of his Miniſter, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the one, as well as the other, the object of Divine Faith.</p>
            <p>Some one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               </gap> ſay, it is an extravagance, which deſerves not to have ſuch notice taken of it; and this without
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65318:12"/>
queſtion will be the pretext to move you to connive at ſuch an exceſſe. But you ought to conſider, <hi>My Lords,</hi> that how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant ſoever the opinion may be, It is advanc'd by perſons who may give a juſt occaſion to apprehend ſtrange conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of it. For clearly, it is not by chance, or the blind paſſion of ſome one private perſon, that it now comes to light; but of old there have been diſpoſitions laid for the introducing it: nor was it uſhered in with ſuch pompe and ceremony, but juſt at that nick of time which they conceived moſt favourable to procure it a ſucceſſeful acceptance, and in which they thought, not any one would have the boldneſſe to hold up his hand in oppoſition to it.</p>
            <p>Their pretenſions perchance are not yet ripe enough to draw a formal approbation of it from the Biſhops; but their hopes are, ſince we muſt ſpeak the plain truth, that their credit, and the power, which of late they have got, of doing both good and bad Offices, will at leaſt be able to keep them in ſilence; ſo that not one ſhall dare attempt the condemnation of it, for fear of drawing on his head the vengeance of ſo potent a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety; and that the <hi>Sorbone,</hi> which now they think they have brought to their beck, will never have the confidence to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure it, what averſion ſoever it may have inwardly for it.</p>
            <p>They hope then, under the favour of this ſilence, and whilſt the whole world ſhall ſeem buried in ſleep, <hi>dum dormirent homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> this cockle, which they have ſowed in the fields of the Church, will take root and grow up by the advantage of the ſeaſon; In the mean time they will leave it to grow to maturi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, according to their manner of expreſſion, <hi>relinquent tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pori maturandum;</hi> and when it ſhall be fully ripe, they will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the natural conſequences; that neceſſarily muſt ſpring from it. For the preſent, they tell us modeſtly, one <hi>may</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve with Divine Faith ſuch like particular Facts; but we ſhall ſhortly hear, that we <hi>are bound</hi> to believ them; which grad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will be eaſie for them to eſtabliſh, becauſe it follows by a neceſſary conſequence out of their principle; it being certain that no man can believe with Divine Faith, but what is a mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter of Faith: and what is ſuch, ought of neceſſity to be believ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed in that nature, when it ſhall be ſufficiently propoſed.

enough for their turns at preſent, that the Biſhops do not condemn this opinion: but we ſhall ſee them ere long inveagle them in, to be the approvers of it, according to an other of their Maximes, which is; That the Church doth approve all ſuch Doctrines, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t ſuffers without making oppoſition.</p>
            <p>It highly concerns you, <hi>My Lords,</hi> to reflect on the danger whereunto not only the Church, but you your ſelves are alſo expoſed; leſt one day the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> bring you in for abettors of their Hereſie, and God himſelf lay it to your charge. For though it be a moſt falſe error, that the Church approvs all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions which it doth not ſuppreſſe, it is notwithſtanding a conſtant truth, confirmed by Popes and Councils, that God imputeth to Paſtors the approval of errors, which they did not in due time oppoſe. <hi>Error cui non reſiſtitur, approbatur Qui non corrigit reſecanda, committit.</hi> Which made the ſecond Council of <hi>Tours</hi> declare, that the Shepheard ſeem'd to ſide with the Woolf, as often as he did not hinder the ſlaughter of his flock, having the power to do it. And St. <hi>Leo,</hi> ſpeaking of thoſe that were negligent in applying remedies to the grievances of the Church, lays them all at their doors: <hi>Qui multam ſaepe nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triunt peſtilentiam, dum neceſſariam diſſimulant adhibere medicinam.</hi> But theſe are reflexions altogether needleſſe to be ſuggeſted to you, <hi>My Lords,</hi> whoſe zeal and Paſtoral vigilance is of greater force to repreſent you what is expedient for the good of the Church in theſe occaſions, then all the diſcourſes that can be made you. It is enough for private Divines to lay before your eyes the emergent evils, and deep wounds inflicted on its Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and only to ſay to each of you in particular the ſame which a Prophet ſaid to God, <hi>Vide, Domine, &amp; conſidera.</hi> See and conſider what Doctrine is taught in the Church, whereof you are the Maſters. Their duty extends no further, and this done, they may take up their reſt, and lament before Almighty God in Silence and Humility.</p>
