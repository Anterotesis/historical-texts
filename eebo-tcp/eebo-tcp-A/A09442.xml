         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

to them that liued in the dayes of <hi>Iohn,</hi> as the Prophecie
<pb facs="tcp:14859:4"/>
of <hi>Daniel</hi> was to them who liued in the time of <hi>Daniel.</hi>
But as that Prophecie being fulfilled, we can now tell
what was foretold in it: so many things being fulfilled
which were foretold in this booke, we may easily see
what is meant by it: and the posteritie to come shall bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
vnderstand this booke then we do, because it
may be, all things are not yet fulfilled. Neither is this
booke like the cities of the<note n="a" place="margin">Num. 13.</note>

expounded by one a most worthie Diuine. The first
Chapter is a Proeme or Preface to the booke: the two
latter are Epistles dedicating this booke. The dedication
is made to<note n="d" place="margin">Reu. 2. 1.</note> seuen seuerall Churches, and by name to the

as the hotest regions bring foorth sweetest spices, so most
zealous people might be most fruitfull in good workes:
that as the Sunne in the heauen is swiftest at her setting,
so the sonnes of God might be best at their ending. But
is it so? no: the more we are taught, the more ignorant

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y purpose in choosing this text, is to
speake of the three first Chapters of this
booke: namely, the seuen seuerall Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
written to the Churches in Asia,
which containe sundrie vses &amp; instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
fit for our time and age.</p>
            <p>Before we come to the matter,<note place="margin">Question.</note> we
must consider of one question, which is,
whether this present booke of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation
be canonicall or not: for some haue heretofore, &amp; some
now do call the authoritie of it in question.<note place="margin">Answer.</note> But we hold, that it
is canonicall, of equall authoritie with other canonicall Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
Our arguments and reasons be these. The first is, because
the doctrine contained in this booke is Apostolicall, as anie
which diligently reades the booke may perceiue. Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the style and maner of opening and expounding the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie
contained in it, is Apostolicall, that is, plaine, simple and
easie, if we consider that it is a prophecie. Thirdly, because this
booke hath bene approued generally of all Churches, refused of
no one Church in any age since <hi>Iohn</hi> wrote it: &amp; it was neuer cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
into questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but of some particular man, neuer of any whole
Church. Fourthly, the things foretold in this booke, came to
passe as they were foretold. As among the rest (in one for all) may
appeare, by that signe <hi>Iohn</hi> saw in the thirteenth Chapter: two
beasts came, one out of the sea, the second out of the earth; the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:14859:11"/>
first signifying the Romaine Empire: the second the Romaine
apostaticall Church: which both are come to passe in this last
age.</p>
            <p>Now follow the reasons which some alleage to proue it not
canonicall:<note place="margin">Reasons why not Canonicall answered. 1. Reason.</note> but they be all of no force. First <hi>S. Iohn</hi> he names him
selfe in this booke, where he neuer named himselfe once in all
his Gospell, no not then when he had iust occasion to name him
selfe, but sought to auoid it: therefore they conclude, that it is
not his booke, but written by some other, and published in his
name.</p>
            <p>The reason is not good.<note place="margin">Answer.</note> For there is great difference betweene
an historie and a prophecie. <hi>S. Iohn</hi> in his historie doth not name
himselfe; for there is no necessarie reason, why one in an historie
of another man should name himself. But in a prophecie, as this
booke is, it is more requisite he should mention his owne name.
And so did other Prophets, as <hi>Ieremiah</hi> mentioneth his name
in his booke at least an hundred times: so <hi>Esay</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
Chapter mention their names. Then seeing they do it so
often, it is no maruell if <hi>S. Iohn</hi> in his booke repeate his name: yet
he doth it but fiue times in the whole booke.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> They obiect, that his style in this booke is not the same with
that he vsed in the penning of the Gospell. <hi>Ans.</hi> The difference
of the stile riseth from the difference of the matter, seeing there
he writes an historie, here he pens a Prophecie. Againe, here
he writes not his own words, but those which he receiued from
Christ by particular reuelation.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> They say, his booke hath bene reiected in diuerse ages as not
canonicall. <hi>Ans.</hi> It cannot be proued that it was euer refused of
any generall Church, but of some priuate man. Now the disal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
of any priuate man, cannot make a whole booke to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected:
for then the Epistle to the Hebrewes, and <hi>Iames</hi> his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle
should not be canonicall, which be receiued of all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
            <p>Now come to the words, which containe two parts. First, a
Preface. Secondly, a Vision. The Preface first containes an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
to his matter, from the first to the ninth verse: the vision,
from the ninth to the end of the chapter. The Preface hath two
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:14859:11"/>
parts: First, the title of the booke: Secondly, the inscription. The
title in the three first verses: the inscription, from the fourth to
the ninth verse. The title in these words: <hi>The reuelation of Iesus
Christ, &amp;c.</hi> A reuelation is nothing else but a manifestation or
discouerie of things secret in respect of men, for the common
good of the Church: and so this word is taken here.</p>
            <p>Reuelations from God in the Scriptures were of three kinds:
first, by dreames: secondly, by vision: thirdly, by created voice
of God face to face: as we may see <hi>Num</hi> 12. 6. 8. 4. partly by
vision, partly, by voice. Now this was not by dreame: for he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
these things not by dreame, vision, or voyce alone, but
by vision from Christ, and by voice from God: so then it is mixt,
partly receiued by vision, partly by voice vttered from God.</p>
            <p>In these three first verses, the Reuelation is described by seuen
arguments: first, by the author, Iesus Christ: secondly, the end:
thirdly, the persons to whom it was directed: fourthly, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
fiftly, the instrument: sixtly, the manner of deliuering it: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenthly,
the fruit of the reuelation. The first argument by which
it pleaseth the holy Ghost to describe this reuelation, is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
<hi>vz.</hi> Iesus Christ, he is the author of it, it comes from him. It
is called his reuelation, in these respects: first, not to exclude the
Father and the holy Ghost, but to shew the speciall office of
Christ: for the peculiar office belonging to the second person, is
to reueale, and to publish, and to manifest the will of God the
Father to the Church: and for that cause he is called the Angell
of the couenant,<note place="margin">Mat. 3. 1.</note> the doctor of the Church, the wisedome of the
Father, because his office is to reueale the will of his Father to
man. Secondly, it is called the reuelation of Iesus Christ, to teach
vs to put difference betweene this reuelation and all satanicall
reuelations: for as God hath his true reuelations, so Satan his
ape hath his counterfeit reuelations, and deliuers them in shew
like to Gods, but they differ much. First, the diuels reuelations
be for the most part ambiguous and doubtfull, that a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell how to take the speech and phrase he giues them in: but
the reuelations of God, (and that in this booke) are certaine, and
in plaine tearmes deliuered. Secondly, the diuels reuelations be
betweene him and his instruments, wicked and bad men: these
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:14859:12"/>
in this and other bookes, be to the godly, to his children and
seruants: as here to <hi>Iohn</hi> and the Church. Thirdly, the diuels
tend to maintaine idolatrie, errors and wickednesse, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.
these to maintaine true Apostolicall doctrine, and the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it is called Christs reuelation, to shew that Christ
now ascending into heauen, and entred into his kingly office,
doth still rule, order, and gouerne his Church: and for that cause
it is not called the reuelation of God the Father, or of the holy
Ghost, but of Iesus Christ, because he guides and gouernes the
Church.</p>
            <p>Seeing Christ Iesus now ascended into heauen,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> entred into
his kingly office, doth giue his Church reuelations: we see his
constant care of his church in this last age of the world. For as in
the first age he gaue doctrine necessarie for saluation and that
time, and after he gaue his Church Prophecies: so in the
new Testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t he published the doctrine of the Prophets plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and also the doctrine of faith &amp; repentance by the Apostles;
and now after all these, being ascended vp into heauen, he hath
no lesse care of his Church: for he hath giuen it now in this last
age a notable Prophecy, and reuelation by <hi>Iohn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Which God gaue vnto him.</hi> These words be added, to shew
how he came by this reuelation, and whence he had it: he had it
giuen him of the Father, and these words explane the former, to
shew, that Christ was the author of it, <hi>God gaue him,</hi> that is, God
the father, not the whole Trinitie. For where this name God, is
opposed to Christ, there it signifies the first person, namely,
God the Father, and the first person is often called by this name
alone, <hi>God,</hi> because he is first in order, and the fountaine of the
Deitie. For Christ receiues his diuine nature, and Godhead
from the Father by communication, the holy Ghost from them
both, the Father receiues it from none.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>God gaue to him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Question. Answer.</note> How can it be giuen to Christ, seeing he was
God, and had all things? <hi>Ans.</hi> We conceiue of Christs 2. wayes:
first, as he is God: secondly, as he is Mediator and head of the
Church, and so he is both God and man. As he is God,
the Father giues him nothing, seeing he is by nature the same
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:14859:12"/>
with the Father in all things, saue in proprietie of persons. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
he is conceiued as the Mediator, not God simply, but
God-man, or God made man: and so he is said to receiue of the
Father in respect of his manhood, as he is God-man, or God
incarnate. So he saith: <hi>All power is giuen me of the Father.
Mat.</hi> 28. that is, as he is Mediator and God incarnate, and
head of his Church. <hi>Phil. 2. God gaue him a name, &amp;c.</hi> not as he
was simply God, but as he was Mediator and in his manhood:
so here the reuelation was giuen him not as he was God simply,
but as he was head of the Church, Mediator and God incarnate.</p>
            <p>Neither can any say hence, Christ shall be inferiour to the
Father in regard of his Godhead: for he receiues it from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as he is God-man, not simply God: and as he is man and
Mediator, he is inferiour to the Father, and confesseth that in
that respect, <hi>God the Father is greater then all.</hi> And <hi>Paule</hi> saith,
God the Father is the head of Christ. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 11. 6. 3.<note place="margin">Ioh. 10. 29.</note> as Christ
is the head of the Church, God-man. Nay, as Christ sits at his
Fathers right hand, he is inferiour to him, not as God, but as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour:
and looke as he receiues all power of the Father, so must
he restore it againe, as he is head of the Church.</p>
            <p>Now followeth the meanes how he gaue Christ this reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.
He gaue it to Christ, and made him Lord of it, so that he
made this his royaltie and priuiledge: for Christ being king of
his Church, and this booke of reuelation being part of his lawe
to the Church, he is king also of this booke as part of his
law and royaltie. Againe, they were reuealed to Christ before
they were reuealed to any creature, man or Angel, and that as he
was man: for his manhood being vnited to his Godhead, he
could not but know them ere any man or Angell knew them, as
he was man.</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> we obserue that this booke of Canonicall Scripture is
Christs, he is Lord of it, and the right of it belongs to him alone.
For as the lawes of a land belong to a Prince and to none else, so
these lawes, the bookes of this Scripture they be Christs, as his
royaltie &amp; priuiledge: for God gaue them to him and to none
but him only, and he sent his Angels to reueale it to the Church.
Now that which is said of this booke, may be said of all the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:14859:13"/>
bookes of Scripture: that as the royaltie and interest of this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
onely to Christ, being giuen to him alone, so the same fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
of all other.</p>
            <p>Then hence I gather: no man in the world hath authoritie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
these lawes, aboue this booke: for this is Christs priuiledge,
nor of any other by proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For these be Christs lawes, al must
be subiect to them, none must be aboue them: for then it should
follow, that they were giuen to men as well as to Christ Iesus.
Hence it followeth, that if all be subiect to these lawes, then no
man hath authoritie to dispense with the Scriptures, or the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
of Christ: for that is to make men to haue royaltie, interest,
and title into these Scriptures. Monarches and Princes haue
great authoritie in their iurisdictions, but they must all be in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection
to these lawes of Christ: for they be indeed great, &amp; haue
authoritie ouer their subiects: yea more, ouer all causes, yet on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
those which be the causes of men: they haue no authoritie in
causes of God, as the Scriptures and the Sacraments.</p>
            <p>Seeing these bookes be Christs royaltie,<note place="margin">Vse. 2.</note> and he alone hath
soueraigne interest in the Church authoritie, we note, that he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
can expound Scripture without helpe of Scripture; he alone
can giue the true sense of Scripture. Indeed men can giue the
sense of Scripture by Scripture: for they haue a ministerie here,
and by Scripture they expound Scripture: but Christ alone with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Scripture can giue the true sense of Scripture.</p>
            <p>This condemnes the popish doctrine, which giues the
Church absolute power and authoritie to expound and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
of Scripture without helpe of the Scripture: for that is to
take Christ his royaltie and priuiledge, and to giue it to men:
but Christ alone hath absolute authoritie to determine of his
owne lawes: men indeed in the Church haue a ministeriall iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by helpe of the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>We see the excellencie of all the Scriptures,<note place="margin">Vse. 3.</note> which is the same
with this booke. Now this booke, it is the gift of God to Christ
Iesus his sonne, yea a most excellent gift: now this is not affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by any writings of men, though neuer so excellent.</p>
            <p>This should teach vs, to reuerence the Scriptures more then
any mens writings whatsoeuer. Then this sheweth the blindnes
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:14859:13"/>
of this age, which delight onely in the hearing and reading the
writings of men, contemning the word of God. And yet the
writings of men be sinfull and erronious, euery way imperfect:
the writings of God, holy, certain, and euery way absolute, being
giuen to the Sonne as he is king, priest and Prophet.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To shew to his seruants co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning this testament shortly to be done.</hi> In
these words be 3. arguments for the description of this Reuelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:
First, the end, <hi>vz.</hi> to shew it: secondly, the persons, his seruants:
thirdly, the matter of it, <hi>vz.</hi> things shortly to be reuealed. The
end of this reuelation was to manifest &amp; declare to his seruants,
to wit, the Church of God (his seruants and children) to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
to them those things which should shortly be fulfilled, and
this is the maine drift of this Reuelation.</p>
            <p>Hence then we note,<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> that the Papists erre, who say, that lay
men should not haue the word, but barre them the reading of the
Scriptures: but the holy Ghost saith, this reuelation was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale
things to come, not onely to the Clergie, nor to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
of the Church, but to his seruants: if so, then to the lay
man as well as the Clergie: vnlesse they will say, he is none of
his seruants. Then this I gather: if that this booke, being most
hard, must be learned of the lay man, then those bookes
which be not so hard must be learned and read, and much
more those which be more easie, as the historie of the Gospell,
the Epistles, &amp;c. Secondly, the persons are the seruants of Christ:
this booke then of Reuelation, belongs not to all men indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently,
but it is written for the seruants of Christ: that is, such as
repent of their sinnes, beleeue truly in Christ, and shew their
faith by the fruites thereof in their liues. And so the Lord saith,
he will reueale his secrets to his seruants the Prophets:<note place="margin">Psal. 25. 12.</note> and the
Lord will not keepe backe but reueale to <hi>Abraham</hi> the things he
was to bring vpon Sodome and Gomorrha.<note place="margin">Mal. 3.</note> Then seeing those
to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lord shewes his will,<note place="margin">Gen. 18.</note> to whom he declares this book
and others, they must be his seruants: we must not content our
selues only to heare the word, and receiue the Sacraments: but
we must seeke to be his seruants, we must repent truly, beleeue
in Christ, and shew this faith in obedience, and then the Lord
will more and more daily acquaint vs with his will. And the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:14859:14"/>
cause why we heare the word daily and neuer profit, but be as
ignorant and blind as before: the cause is, because we be not
his seruants: we be bare hearers, neuer practise that we heare in
faith and obedience, we repent not, neither liue a new life by
repentance in new obedience. For else if the Lord see any which
is his true seruant he approues of him: he likes of him, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints
him daily with his will and word, increaseth his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and obedience.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vse. 2.</note> seeing that this reuelation is written for the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
of Iesus Christ: I obserue that Christ is true God: the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is, because they be called his seruants, that is, Christs. The
reason stands thus, he which is Lord of the Church &amp; the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
thereof, and also of Angels, (as it followeth after) he is true
God: but Christ is Lord of men and Angels, <hi>ergo</hi> he is true
God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His seruants:</hi> not to all men, to the whole world and euery
singular man, but to his seruants. Hereby we see the opinion of
those which hold, God would haue all to be saued, and cals all
men, is false. For if he called all effectually, then he would offer
al the meanes, to wit, the word of God, that so they might be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led:
but he writes it not to all but to his seruants; now, that which
is true of this booke, is true of the whole Scripture. The Lord
shewed his word to <hi>Iacob,</hi> not to all the world; not to all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
as to him. <hi>Psal.</hi> 147. 19. 20. he <hi>shewed to Iacob,</hi> that is, his
true members, his seruants and true Christians.</p>
            <p>Now followeth the matter which is the fourth argument of
the description of this reuelation, <hi>vz. Things which shortly must
come to passe:</hi> and in this, the matter of this booke is distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
from all other bookes of the Scripture, which speake
generally of things either present or now past; but this speakes
of things to come.</p>
            <p>The matter of this booke is described by two arguments:
first, these things be necessarie, <hi>they must be done.</hi> Secondly, by
the circumstance of time, <hi>shortly or quickly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, the matter is things to come, which <hi>must be done:</hi> so
speakes the holy Ghost in many places of the word. As Christ
saith, shewing the necessitie: <hi>Offences must come:</hi> so <hi>Paule</hi> saith:
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:14859:14"/>
               <hi>There must be heresies. Act.</hi> 14. We <hi>must,</hi> through manie tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
enter into heauen, &amp;c. So to <hi>Timothy:</hi> they which be godly
<hi>must suffer afflictions.</hi> Shewing in all these places, that things
which are to come, must necessarily come to passe.</p>
            <p>But this doctrine agrees not with mans reason,<note place="margin">Obiection.</note> though it be
the will of God: for men will say; If all things come to passe
necessarily, then it takes away mans free will: for necessitie and
free will can not stand together.<note place="margin">Ansvver.</note> 
               <hi>Answer.</hi> They may. Indeed
constraint and mans will can not stand: but mans will and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable
necessitie may stand both together. As I shew thus.
In God there is absolute free will, yet he doth many things of
necessitie: as he willeth that which is good necessarily; for he
can not possibly will that which is euill, but willes that which is
good most freely. So Christ he died necessarily: he could not
but die; for he died in regard of Gods counsell: and yet he died
most willingly, and gaue himselfe most freely to die when he
suffered death: ergo these two, mans free will and vnchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
necessitie, though not constraint, may stand together.</p>
            <p>Men will obiect againe, If things come to passe by necessitie,
then it is in vaine to vse anie meanes, as to heare the word, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
the sacraments: for Gods will must come to passe, do we
what we will do. <hi>Answer.</hi> These men must consider, that as God
hath appointed what things must come to passe, so he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
the meanes how they must come to passe. Then seeing
the Lord hath appointed as well the meanes as the ende, we
should by this necessitie rather be induced to vse the meanes,
then not to vse them.</p>
            <p>To make this more plaine: we must know, there is a double
necessitie; one is absolute, another is but in part. I call that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
necessitie, which can not be otherwise possibly. As that
God liues, it cannot be otherwise; he is omnipotent, he cannot
but be so. There is a necessitie which is not absolute but in part:
as when anie thing done is necessarie, because it depends on ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie
causes. As fire to burne, this is not absolutely necessarie,
but in part, because it depends on that order which God set in
things in the creation. It is not absolute: for if God should
change that order in the creation, then it may be fire should
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:14859:15"/>
ceasse to burne,<note place="margin">Dan. 2.</note> as it did in the three children in the ouen.</p>
            <p>Now in this place where he saith; <hi>These things must be done,</hi>
it is not to be meant of absolute necessitie, but of that which is
but in part: for they must come to passe necessarily, onely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of Gods decree. In them selues they be contingent, neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
by the vnchangeable decree of God. In regard of which
decree of God, all things which come to passe be necessarie: yet
can it not be inferred; therefore man hath no free will. For this
necessitie taketh it not away, neither the second causes, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
disposeth them, and inclines mans free will.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the matter is described by the time, <hi>shortly,</hi> or
quickly. But how can this be true, seeing things spoken of in
this booke came not to passe a thousa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d years after, which is a lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
time? <hi>Ans.</hi> They may be said to come to passe shortly, though a
thousand yeares after, in two respects. First of God, to whom a
thousand years is but as one day. Secondly, in regard of men: for
though a thousand years seeme a long time to men ere it be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired,
yet when it is once past, it seemes but a short time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Which must shortly come.</hi> He sets downe these wordes for two
causes. First to terrifie all carnall and carelesse men; for it fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telleth
iudgements and destructions to those which liue in their
sinnes, which be enemies to the Church of God; and so it strikes
a terror into their hearts, seeing their destruction comes short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
And no doubt, if anie carnall man could lay this to his heart,
that iudgement must come quickly, it would rowze him, if he
belonged to Christ, or else would terrifie his soule.</p>
            <p>We here liue still in our sinnes;<note place="margin">Application.</note> though we heare the word
daily we neuer repent of our sinnes. But if we which be so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
wold consider, that destruction and iudgement must come
shortly to those which be carelesse, it would stirre vs vp to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
if we had anie grace. Let these carelesse men, let these
consider, that the hand of God may be on them quickly, take
hold on them ere they be aware. Let the young man not runne
on in his sins,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 2. 3.</note> lest the Lord come ere he be prepared and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
For the Lord will come quickly, his iudgements they make
hast and are not farre off, they delay not.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the holy Ghost setteth downe this circumstance of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:14859:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
time, to arme the seruants of Christ, the true members of the
Church, against all persecutions, afflictions &amp; calamities which
might befall them. For the children of God being afflicted and
crossed, they might be impatient and discouraged: but lest they
should be so, the Lord here telleth them, that his coming shall
be shortly, they shall not alwayes beare the heauie burthen of
afflictions on their shoulders, but for a while, a short time, and
then the Lord will come and ease them, deliuer them, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
their troubled minds, lest they should be swallowed vp with
griefe.</p>
            <p>It followeth: <hi>Which he sent.</hi> That is, which reuelation he sent
and shewed by his Angell. These words are set downe for two
causes. First to shew, that <hi>S. Iohn</hi> he opened and published this
booke not rashly, but by calling and warrant from God. This
teacheth vs what must be our dutie in all our actions, whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
we take in hand we must looke we haue our calling and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.
This was the Apostles practise, as here <hi>S. Iohns;</hi> he opened
not this reuelation before he had speciall warrant. So must we
looke for our warrant in the word, and till we haue it we must
not enterprise anie thing.</p>
            <p>If this dutie were practised, there would be more conscience
in the seruice and worship of God, more care and conscience
in our dealings with men then there is.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he setteth downe these words, to get more reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and greater authoritie to this booke, that it might more
be accepted of: and therefore he saith it was sent by an Angell
to the Church. And this is a verie good reason to get credite to
it and reuerence. For if an earthly Prince should write his letter
to his subiect, and withall send it by one of his gard, no doubt
the subiect would receiue it most reuerently. The Scriptures
they be the epistle of God, sent to his Church, not by anie but
by his Angell: then this should procure a thousand times more
reuerence, seeing God sends his letter to his Apostle <hi>S. Iohn,</hi>
and so to the Church by the hand of an Angell.</p>
            <p>Now followeth the fifth argument of the description of this
reuelation, which is, the instruments of this reuelation, whereby
it is conueyed from God to the Church: and these be two. First
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:14859:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
an Angell, Secondly, <hi>Iohn</hi> the Apostle or Euangelist.</p>
            <p>The first instrument is an Angell, by whom he sent this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation,
to conuey it to his Church. And so the Lord hath v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
their ministerie in other places of the scriptures.</p>
            <p>So when the Law was giuen,<note place="margin">Act. 7.</note> it was by the hand of an Angel.
<hi>Daniel</hi> had many of his dreames expounded by an Angell.<note place="margin">Dan 9. 21 &amp; 8</note> And
the seuen visions in this booke of the Reuelation were shewed
to <hi>Iohn</hi> by an Angell. Yet we must take heede we gather not
hence, that we may worship them, or pray to them, because they
be present about vs and see our wants: but before we pray to
them, we must haue a commandement from God, and a speciall
promise, that they can and will heare and helpe vs, else we must
not pray to them.</p>
            <p>The second instrument is <hi>Iohn</hi> the Apostle and Euangelist,
which penned one of the Gospels, that Disciple whom <hi>Iesus</hi>
loued, sonne to <hi>Zebedeus,</hi> kinsman to Christ.</p>
            <p>Now to procure credit and more reuerence to his reuelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
he describeth himselfe by two arguments. First, calling himselfe
his <hi>seruant Iohn.</hi> Secondly, by an effect, <hi>Which bare record, &amp;c.</hi>
First he cals him selfe the seruant of Christ, not the Disciple of
Christ, not Christ his cosin or kinsman, which he might haue
done, but he cals himself the seruant of Christ. For he had lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that which Christ speaks <hi>Mat. 12. 50. He which doth the will
of my Father, he is my mother, sister and brother:</hi> not he which is
kinsma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or cosin, but in this, to do his fathers wil, stands the note
of his kinsman. And in this, to be the seruant of Christ, stands the
dignitie of a Christian. Had not the blessed Virgin Christs mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
bene a seruant of Christ, she had neuer bin saued by Christ.
Then by this we see, it is nothing to helpe a man to saluation
to be borne of great kinred, to come of Princes &amp; noble bloud,
but to be the seruants of Christ, to do the will of Christ, this is to
be allyed and cosin to Christ. And if we will be the seruants of
Christ, we must become new creatures, we must leaue off our
old seruice, and as <hi>S. Paule</hi> saith, he knewe not Christ in the
flesh, but serued him in the spirit. And we must not content our
selues to be his seruants in the generall calling of a Christian,
but in our particular callings. For <hi>S. Iohn</hi> was his seruant not
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:14859:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
onely in beleeuing in him, and obeying him generally; but in
beleeuing and obeying him in the particular calling of an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle.
So <hi>Paule,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 9.</note> he was the seruant of Christ, not only generally,
but in the speciall calling of the Gospell, in preaching the same.
This example of his and the Apostles must be our direction, we
must not content our selues with the generall calling of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
but serue Christ in our particular callings. It is not inough
to professe Christ in publike assemblies, to heare the word, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
the Sacraments, but in our particular callings we must
serue him at home: as the magistrate, not onely in his generall
calling of Christianitie, but in his particular calling, as he is a
magistrate: the Minister as he is a Minister: the maister of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie
as he is a maister: and so all men in their particular callings
must obey Christ. And if the maister of a familie come to the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly,
heare the word, receiue the Sacraments, yet in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie
faile, and performe not the duties of a maister, he is but an
hypocrite, he is no true Christian, though men accept so of him;
because he must be obedient to Christ both in generall and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
calling.</p>
            <p>Now followeth the second argument by which <hi>Iohn</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
namely the effect, that <hi>he bare record of the word of
God.</hi> Which <hi>Iohn</hi> bare this record, partly by preaching, partly
by penning the Gospell of Christ.</p>
            <p>And because the word of God hath two parts, the Law and
the Gospell, he shewes in the next words, that he meanes espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the Gospell of Christ, adding, <hi>Of things done and sayd by
Christ.</hi> And lest any man should call his testimonie into que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
he saith he testifies that whereof he was an eye witnesse:
he <hi>saw it,</hi> and therefore could not be deceiued, and therefore his
testimonie was true.</p>
            <p>The end why he alleageth these words, is to shew that he is a
faithfull pen-man of this booke, that so it might haue more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence:
for he which was faithfull in penning the Gospell of
Christ, the same also is faithfull in penning this Prophecie of
the Church.</p>
            <p>By these words we may gather,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> that to testifie the doctrine of
the Prophets and Apostles to be the truth of God, is a true note
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:14859:17"/>
of a true Prophet. And by these we may distinguish betweene
a true Prophet and a false; if they bring the doctrine of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
and the Prophets it is true, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. If they worke won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and their doctrine be to draw men from the true God, they
are false Prophets and must be put to death. And our Sauiour
Christ being asked of his authoritie, he alledges <hi>Luk. 10. 1. Iohns</hi>
testimonie, and confirmeth <hi>Iohns</hi> testimonie to be true, asking
them this question, <hi>The baptisme of Iohn, was it from heauen or of
men?</hi> shewing that <hi>Iohn</hi> was a true Prophet, seeing his Baptisme,
that is, his doctrine was from heauen.</p>
            <p>Hereby we see, the difference of a true Prophet and false al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
by the Papists, is no true difference: for they say, If one
can worke miracles, he is a true Prophet: whereas <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.
false Prophets may do that. But the true marke of a true Prophet
is the doctrine deliuered by the Prophets and Apostles: and he
which brings this, though he can not worke a miracle, is a true
Prophet.</p>
            <p>Now followeth the sixth argument, by which this reuelation
is described: which is, in the manner of propounding and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering
of it to the Church. And this maner and forme of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
of it stands in foure degrees. First, God the Father giueth
it to Christ the Mediator. Secondly, Christ the Mediatour and
head of the Church, giueth it to an Angell. Thirdly, the Angell
conueyes it to <hi>Iohn</hi> the Apostle. Fourthly, <hi>Iohn</hi> directed and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
by the holie Ghost, deliuereth it to the Churches.</p>
            <p>Now as this particular booke was, so no doubt all the whole
Scriptures were conueyed to the Church. Now in that the Lord
hath so conueyed his Scriptures to man, we see his perpetuall
care and loue of man, and of the members of his Church. Also
we see the great excellencie and dignitie, as also the perfection
of these bookes, seeing they were deliuered to man by God, and
by him he deliuers his will to his Church.</p>
            <p>This shewes the blasphemie and sin of the Church of Rome,
who call the written word of God, a dead letter, a dumbe
iudge: they hold, that generall Councels be equall to the word;
that the vniuersall consent of the Church is aboue the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
it giues life and sense to them, which otherwise they say of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:14859:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
themselues be but an inkie and dumbe word. But we see they
be farre aboue all these: for they be most absolute and perfect,
and also most excellent, seeing they being giuen of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to Christ the mediator and head of the Church, and by him
conueyed to an Angell, who deliuers them to <hi>Iohn,</hi> and he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
them to the Church: these degrees of the deliuerie of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
shew they be most excellent and perfect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Blessed are they which heare, &amp;c.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verse 3.</note> Here is the seuenth and last
argument of this description of the Reuelation: which is, by the
fruite, effect, and the profite which comes of it, being heard or
read: and ioyned with marking and attention, it brings hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Blessed.</hi> That is, blessednesse which stands in the fellowship
of God, and life euerlasting belongs to them, which heare and
reade this booke, and marke it, keepe it in memorie, remember
the things contained in it, being a prophecie of the estate of the
Church, partly present, partly to come.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Blessed is he which reades.</hi> Here the holy Ghost setteth downe
the proper end of the Scriptures, &amp; of this booke particularly.
For the ende of this booke, and so of all other bookes of the
Scriptures, is to bring men to happinesse, and felicitie, and life
euerlasting. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20. last: the Scriptures be to make vs beleeue in
Christ, that so beleeuing we might haue <hi>eternall life. 1. Ioh. 1. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi>
He declared to them the word of Christ, that by it they might
haue fellowship with God the Father, Sonne and holy Ghost,
which fellowship is true happinesse it selfe, <hi>Ioh. 5. 39. Search the
scriptures, for in them you thinke to haue eternall life.</hi> And in this
they differ from all other books and writings of men. For mens
writings, being penned either by the light of nature, and so be
thence erronious, and misse of the end of happinesse and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
life: or else they be penned by them which haue light by
by the word; and so as they agree with the word, they be groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on the word, and haue all their truth from it.</p>
            <p>Seeing the end of this booke,<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> as of the other bookes of scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
is to bring men to happinesse, we see the opinion and
practise of the Church of Rome is damnable, who barre the
people of God from reading and hearing the Scriptures in their
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:14859:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
vulgar tongue: for in barring them of the meanes, they barre
them of their saluation the end of them; whereas <hi>S. Iohn</hi> would
by these wordes, <hi>Blessed, &amp;c.</hi> drawe men and allure them to
to reade and delight in the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n=""/>Seeing the end of this booke and the rest, is to bring men to
happinesse, we are here admonished, all of vs to reade and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate
in them, and search them, as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 39. euen as we would
search for gold, or some precious thing which we would faine
finde, (so the word imports.) And he addeth the reason: <hi>For in
them you thinke to haue eternall life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But some will say: I cannot reade, I was neuer brought vp in
learning. <hi>S. Iohn</hi> cuts off this excuse in the next words: <hi>Blessed is
he which reades or heares the words of this prophecie.</hi> So that if he
cannot reade, yet if he heare and keepe it, he is blessed. Then
those which can not reade them, they must procure others to
reade, they must hearken and heare diligently.</p>
            <p>We must learne to carrie in minde the distinction betweene
the bookes of God and writings of men. Gods word brings a
man which keepes it to happinesse: but mans of them selues can
not, vnlesse they haue light from the word of God.</p>
            <p>And if this distinction were imprinted in our harts, we should
not be so delighted either to heare or speake the words of God
mixed with the words of sinfull men.</p>
            <p>First, among the Iewes it was not lawfull to mingle cloth of
diuerse kinds: then much lesse will the Lord suffer his word to
be mingled with the sayings of erronious and sinfull men, be
they neuer so learned or ancient.</p>
            <p>Secondly, here followeth the right manner and way of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and reading the Scriptures, which stands in two things.
First, we must set downe a certaine end why we reade the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
which is, that we may attaine to happinesse, fellowship
with God, and life euerlasting. And when this takes place: that
we set downe this end, that we reade and heare them with care
and conscience to practise them. Secondly, we must keepe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
remember the things we reade or heare. And this second point
is principall, to heare and to reade so, as we keepe those things
we heare or reade: and so as we make obseruation of that we
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:14859:18"/>
heare; so the words import. Here we see the cause, why we
heare and reade the word dayly, yet no profite comes thereby:
the cause is, because we be onely hearers, we keepe it not to
make vse of it in our liues.</p>
            <p>That we may keepe the word which we heare or reade, it is
so commended to vs in many places. <hi>Luke 2. 19. Mary</hi> is said
<hi>to keepe and to ponder all these things in her heart.</hi> Psal. 119. 8. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid
he hid the statutes of the Lord in his heart.</hi> Luke 11. <hi>Blessed are
they which heare the word and keepe it.</hi> Iames 1. 21. <hi>We must keepe
the word, which is grafted in vs:</hi> where it is compared to a ciens
or graffe, which is set into a stocke: so the word is ingrafted into
our hearts, and there it must abide and bring forth fruite.</p>
            <p>That we may keepe this word,<note place="margin">Rules to keepe Gods vvord.</note> we must first learne the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Religion in the Catechisme: both old and young must
learne them, for that is the beginning of all knowledge: and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
though a man reade and heare the word, and yet learne not the
grounds, he cannot keepe it. So that we see the cause why many
(especially aged folke) heare the word from yeare to yeare, and
neuer profit, but are as ignorant as euer they were, they be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
learning, yet neuer learne any thing: the reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they will not abase themselues to learne those principles
of Religion, those first seeds, without which they cannot profit
by and keepe the word.</p>
            <p>That we may keepe those things we heare or reade, we must <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
con our part before we come, we must addresse our selues, we
must not rush on Gods ordinance without preparation. In the
old Testament when the people offered sacrifice,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 16. 6.</note> they must
<hi>sanctifie themselues:</hi> so we in receiuing of the Lords supper,
we prepare our selues reuerently. Now that we do in the
Lords supper, we must do in hearing the word, seeing there is
no difference, but that that Supper is onely a visible word, the
word preached is an audible word. When the people receiued
the law,<note place="margin">Exod. 19.</note> the Lord co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded them to sanctifie themselues three
daies before. So then when we come to heare the word,
which is the law expounded, we must sanctifie our selues, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
our hearts to heare it.<note place="margin">Rules for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Gods word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> This preparation stands in these
things: 1. we must put out of our hearts all by-thoughts, all cares
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:14859:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and thoughts of worldly affaires, and we must set our hearts to
seeke the Lord, <hi>Ezra</hi> 7. to looke in the law, that we may know
the will of God reuealed in his word; withall we must make our
carnest prayers to God, that he would open our eyes, that we
may see his will, soften our hearts, and make our eares attentiue
as <hi>Lidiaes</hi> were, and also giue vs grace to embrace his word, and
keepe it.</p>
            <p>When we are about to heare or reade the word, we must haue
humble hearts, else we cannot keepe the word, nor beleeue the
promises in the same. The Lord he reueales his secrets to the
<hi>humble in spirit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 25. 11.</note> that is, which be humbled for their sinnes, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
and touched with their owne infirmities, which haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite,
broken and bruised hearts; but in the proud heart, there is no
keeping of the word, there is no hole in it for the word to lie in,
but it is wholly possessed and puffed vp with selfe-loue and
pride.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The heart must be an honest heart: we must not onely haue
our hearts touched with the remembrance of our sinnes, but
they must be honest hearts,<note place="margin">Luke 8. 15.</note> good hearts, such as are not purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to liue in sinne, or any one sinne, be it neuer so litle, but who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
purposed to serue the Lord: we must not come with vnchast or
wicked hearts, with minds to leaue all sinne, but yet to liue in
some one sinne.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> We must haue a beleeuing heart. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 2. The old Iewes
heard the word, but it profited them not, because they mingled
it not with faith in their hearts: where he compares them to a
vessel, in which there must be both the word and faith, and these
must be mingled together; it must be tempered by faith, &amp; then
it will be a word of power, of life and saluation: and this is the
onely meanes to remember the word, and to beleeue truly the
iudgements denounced against sinne and sinners, and promises
pronounced for the true beleeuers. But incredulitie, is when we
except the curses against sin as not pertaining to vs, and cannot
apply the promises of the Gospell. This is the proper cause of
all ignorance and obliuion; so that we must labour aboue all
things for this true faith, to beleeue the word, and then we shall
well and easily remember it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:14859:19"/>
We must haue hearing hearts: besides these eares of the body,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
we must haue new eares pearced. We must haue our eares ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
to become listeners and pliable to the word, that when the
Lord cals vs to do his wil;<note place="margin">Psal. 40. 6, 7.</note> we may answer with <hi>Dauid: I am ready
to do thy will, O God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further, after we haue read or heard the word, we must pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
that we heare, in performing true repentance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and laboring
faithfully in our vocation: for as we see men of trades become
cunning by the continuall practise of their trades: so if we
practise true obedience in repentance and our vocation, we shal
be skilfull in the word. It followeth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Which are written in the booke of this prophesie.</hi> The child of
God must keepe and remember the whole word of God, yet it
is his speciall duty to keepe these prophesies which are to come.
So the Angell bids <hi>Daniel</hi> seale vp the booke of the Prophesie
till the time come,<note place="margin">Dan. 12. 4.</note> that is, remember and keepe it diligently. So
<hi>Mathew 24. 15. When they shall see the abhomination of desolation,</hi>
speaking of things to come, he would haue them to marke and
remember what he saith, Mat. 24. 25. <hi>Behold, I haue told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:</hi>
where he shewes, that when any great things are to befall
the Church, then we must in these be most carefull to remember
them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the time is at hand.</hi> Here is a reason of the former words,
<hi>Blessed is he which readeth, &amp;c.</hi> Seeing the time of the accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
of this Prophesie is at hand, and must shortly be fulfilled,
therefore those be blessed which reade and keepe this prophesie;
and it is an answer to a secret obiection. For they might haue
said, We need not reade this Prophesie, seeing it shal not be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
in our dayes; but he addeth, <hi>The time is at hand,</hi> and so ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
that obiection away.</p>
            <p>Now seeing these words were in the first verse, and here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
againe, he would teach vs that they containe some
waighty matter for vs to be considered, and to be earnestly
thought of. Now S. <hi>Iohn</hi> addes these words for two causes: first,
because the Church, though it cannot be ouertaken with deadly
sleepe, yet it may slumber, and be cast into some beginnings of
sleepe: as the fiue wise virgins, though they slept not so carelesly
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:14859:20"/>
as the other, yet they all slept, not a deadly sleepe, but a slumber:
for in the Church there may be some remnants of security. <hi>Cant.</hi>
5. 2. The Church sleepes, but so as she alwayes listens as awaken,
being in a light slumber. Now least the Church should be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
sleeping and drowsie, the holy Ghost addes these words,
<hi>The time of the last iudgement is at hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, he addes these words to confirme the Church, and
all the true members of Christ against afflictions: seeing by these
words he foretels them, that they be to last but a short time; the
time of iudgement is at hand, the affliction cannot long endure.
Then this should comfort those which suffer for Christ his sake.</p>
            <p>In this that Christ foretels the Church,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> that now in the last
age the time is at hand; we must be assured that whatsoeuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falleth
the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of Christ, shal shortly befal them; temtations,
afflictions, the crosse and calamity shall presently befall vs, the
time of iudgement is at hand, it will presently befall vs. And if
we had this confidence, that the last iudgement is at hand, it
would make vs do all in good conscience, stay vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many sins:
and the want of this is the cause of much mischiefe: for so the
bad seruant thinking his maister would defer his comming, he
smites and beates his fellow seruants. And the old world liued in
sinne, and would not beleeue the flood should come, though
they were foretold of it, till they were all swept away by
water.</p>
            <p>We then should lay this to our harts: euer think the Lord is at
the doore, he is presently to come to iudgement. And we ought
the rather to thinke of this; for we haue had ease, peace, and the
Gospell flourishing this; 8 yeares with all temporall blessings.
Now the state of the Church, is now peace and now trouble
and persecution. Now then, seeing these crosses which must fall
on the Church, they be to be done presently, we cannot but
looke for affliction and persecution after so long peace and
preaching.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iohn to the seuen Churches in Asia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verse 4.</note> 
               <hi>grace and peace, &amp;c.</hi> In this
fourth verse is the second part of this Chapter, which is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of this booke; wherein is first the party which writes it
and dedicates it: secondly, the parties to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is dedicated: first,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:14859:20"/>
the party which dedicates it, is <hi>Iohn:</hi> secondly, the parties to
whom, the seuen Churches in Asia.</p>
            <p>In the inscription are two parts, first, a dedication, secondly, a
salutation, contained from the fourth till the ninth verse. In the
dedication, there be first the party which dedicates it, secondly,
the parties to whom it is dedicated. The party which dedicates it
is <hi>Iohn,</hi> who here againe in this fourth verse repeates his name,
yet so as he repeates no more but his bare name without any ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
of commendation: he repeats it againe, to shew and certifie
euery Reader of this booke, that he was without all doubt the
true pen-man of the holy Ghost in writing this Reuelation. But
though he repeate his name, yet he doth not adde any titles of
honour, as he did in the first verse many titles of praise and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation.
This he doth to giue vs a true patterne of modesty
and humility, which is, neuer to speake in our own causes to our
owne praises, but onely in cases of necessity, when Gods glory
may be aduanced, and the credit of our particular callings main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.
This <hi>Paul</hi> practised, who often humbles himselfe, and
cals himselfe the least of all the Apostles, yea the chiefe of all
sinners: yet when the credit of his Apostleship came into que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
then he sets out himselfe, shewing he was a true Apostle,
and aboue those which did falsly call themselues so. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.
So may we, when the glory of God, or the credit of our particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
callings be in question, set out our selues with titles of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation.</p>
            <p>The persons to whom he wrote, were the seuen Churches in
Asia: concerning them, note two things, first, he cals them <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi>
secondly, <hi>in Asia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why writes he to the Churches rather then to the Church,
seeing there is but one true Church? <hi>Ans.</hi> The Church may be
considered, first, as it is the whole company of the elect, and so
it is but one: secondly, as it is parted and diuersly sundred into
parts; as in one country there is one Church, or one part of the
Church is in one city or towne, another part in some other
And there may be many Churches, seeing euery congregation
professing the Gospell of Christ, is a Church, being a member
of the true Catholicke Church: as the sea is but one, yet there be
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:14859:21"/>
many parts of the sea, which lying against other countries, are
called by their names, as the English, French, Spanish, Italian sea.
So the particular Churches in particular countries, townes and
cities, be Churches, though not the Catholicke Church, but
members of it. Note first, the matter of this book concernes the
Church, seeing it is a propheticall history concerning the estate
of the Church, from the time of <hi>Iohn</hi> to the end: and therefore it
is meet it should be dedicated to the Church. Secondly, it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
to the Church, seeing the true members of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke
Church be the pillars and ground of truth: not that their
authority is aboue the word, but because they preserue the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
as a treasury from age to age. And they be pillars and
grounds of truth, because they giue testimony to the truth of
Gods word. 3. Because they publish the truth of Gods word,
in and by the ordinary ministery of the word; and so the church
being the pillar and ground of truth, it is fit this booke should be
dedicated to it. Secondly, he writes it not to all Churches, but
makes choise of these seuen Churches in Asia: first, because they
were then most famous, as the Chapters following, and histories
of the Church do shew. Secondly, he sayes not, to the Churches
of Ierusalem and of the Iewes, but of Asia, to shew them that
which was long before foretold was now fulfilled; namely, that
the Gentiles according as the Prophets foretold, should be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led:
which now was verified, seeing the Gentiles dwelt in Asia.</p>
            <p>Seeing <hi>Iohn</hi> wrote and dedicated this booke to the Churches
in Asia many yeares after Christ,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> &amp; not to the Church of Rome:
then we see that the Papists are deceiued, who would haue their
Church the mother Church, and all other Churches must rely
on theirs: but if that Church of Rome had bene the mother, and
most famous, no doubt <hi>Iohn</hi> would haue dedicated it to her. But
he doth dedicate it to the Churches in Asia, shewing they were
then more famous then Rome.</p>
            <p>2 Now followes the salutation,<note place="margin">The Salutation</note> 
               <hi>Grace and peace &amp;c.</hi> Salutation
is of two forts, ciuill or religious: ciuil, as that which men vse or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
with one another: 2. religious, which is more peculiar
and proper to the Church: and so it is here a religious salutation.
And seeing the Apostles vse it commonly in all their Epistles,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:14859:21"/>
may be called an Apostolicall salutation. They vsed this in all
their Epistles, Grace and peace, &amp;c. which they did, because their
ministery was of grace and peace, and they made their salutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
answerable to their ministery: for their Apostleship stood in
these two, to preach the word, and to pray for the people, that
they might haue grace &amp; peace. And the apostles vse this phrase
in manner of blessing, for when their ministery stood in two acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
in preaching and praying for the people, vnder the second
action of praying, was contained this, to blesse the people: and
so did the high Priests and Leuites:<note place="margin">Num. 6. 24.</note> as also Christ he vsed this: so
Ministers to shew their duty more fully,<note place="margin">Iohn 20. 21.</note> after they preach the
word, they blesse the people.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Grace be with you.</hi> Most excellent words: and containe in
them the summe and substance of the whole Gospell. <hi>Grace</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
two things, first, Gods fauour and good will, secondly, his
graces. Here it signifies his fauour, because in this salutation
grace is opposed to peace, which is a grace of God, so that it
cannot be meant of a grace of God: then by it is meant his good
will and fauour, whereby he accepts of vs for Christ his sake.
S. <hi>Iohn</hi> begins with <hi>Grace</hi> first, and not with <hi>Peace,</hi> because
grace is the ground of peace, and all blessings &amp; graces of God.
We must first be in Gods fauour, then we must looke to haue
prosperitie and graces from God. Grace is the ground of all
blessings, as of our election, vocation, redemption, iustification,
sanctification, of faith, repentance, and perseuerance in faith and
repentance: nay it is all in all in the matter of our saluation. For
this cause he begins with it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And peace.</hi> Peace is taken first for welfare and good successe
in things of this world, by Gods blessing. Exod. 18. 7. <hi>Moses</hi>
askes <hi>Iethro</hi> his father in law of his peace, that is, of his welfare;
and so it is partly taken in this place.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is taken for that vnity and blessed concord we
shall haue in the kingdome of God, and so it is especially taken
here. And being thus taken, it hath sixe parts; first, when we
haue peace with God, which is, when we stand in the fauour of
God, reconciled to him in Christ Iesus. Secondly, when we
haue peace with Gods Angels, in that they guard vs and cary vs
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:14859:22"/>
as a nurse doth her child in her armes, that we hurt not our feete
at any stone: and when they reioyce at our good estate. <hi>Psal.</hi>
91. 11.</p>
            <p>The third is peace with a mans selfe, when his conscience
will not accuse him, but excuse and cleare him; as when our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
is washed in the blood of Christ, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 7. this peace
passeth all vnderstanding.</p>
            <p>The fourth is peace with the church. So <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 32. those which
beleeued, were all of one mind and heart, had peace with each
other. So <hi>Esa.</hi> 11. 6. The wild beast and the Lion, the Lamb and
the Cockatrise and the yong child shall lie together.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, this peace &amp; fauor of God, is with the enemies of God,
so far as it is for the good of the Church, and the glory of God.
So <hi>Ioseph</hi> had peace in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> house. So <hi>Daniel</hi> had peace
with the Kings Eunuches: for though he was free when the
children were cast into the ouen, yet he did not reuolt; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fauoured, they saued him.</p>
            <p>The sixt is peace with all Gods creatures, beasts, birds,
all creatures in heauen and earth. <hi>Ose.</hi> 2. 18. The Lord will make
a couenant betweene vs and all his creatures. <hi>Psal.</hi> 91. 13. The
child of God he shall tread vpon the lion and serpent, and they
shall not hurt him: for when a man is in Gods fauour, what crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
dares to hurt him? nay al the creatures are ready and willing
to serue him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Grace and peace.</hi> As though he had said, first you must be in
the fauour of God, you must haue vnity and reconciliation with
and in Christ, and then this peace, welfare, prosperity in all good
things as farre as is necessary, yea then concord and vnity with
God and all his creatures will follow.</p>
            <p>Whereas the Apostle wishes them grace in the first place,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> he
would teach vs that this Gods fauour is to be sought for aboue
all things, yea in the first place. <hi>Psal. 4. 6. Many say, Who will
shew vs any good?</hi> But <hi>Dauid</hi> he seekes this grace and fauour of
God, <hi>Lord lift vp the light of thy countenance vpon me:</hi> let me be
in thy fauour.<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 57.</note> And often he sayes, the <hi>Lord he is his portion,</hi> inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance,
and his lot: shewing, to be in the loue and fauor of God,
is to be preferred before all things in the world. So must we
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:14859:22"/>
seeke first to be in Gods fauour, make that our chiefest care,
seeke it aboue all things: but we litle practise this, because we
bring from our cradles naturall presumption, which perswades
vs that we be in the fauour of God, that we haue his loue to vs.
But we must cast off this naturall presumption, and take a new
course; and the first step to come to grace, is to see that we want
grace: we must see that we be lost sheepe: prodigall children in
our selues, the very fire-brands of hell: and this, to see our owne
want of grace, is the first step to grace. The second step, is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
it when we see that we want it, to hunger and long for it.
Thirdly, to lay hold on it, to apprehend this fauour and grace
by true and liuely faith, to apply the promises of saluation by
faith in Christ Iesus: and this is the last steppe to get this
grace.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in that he sets downe, first grace, secondly peace,
here is the true order of seeking for things and blessings in this
life. First, for grace and Gods fauour: secondly, for peace and
welfare: not first peace and welfare, but first for grace. So Christ
bids vs, first to seeke the kingdome of God, and the rigteousnes
thereof, and then when we are in Gods kingdome of grace, all
things needfull shall be ministred to vs.</p>
            <p>This discouers the bad practise of most men, who begin at a
wrong end: first, with peace in their callings, to get honour, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
pleasure or preferment, neuer seeking first for grace and
Gods fauour: but if we would haue peace, we must first haue
grace.</p>
            <p>But men, if God blesse them in riches, health and wealth, they
say, Oh, God loues me: but alas, we deceiue our selues; for we
may haue peace, yet want grace: we may haue this welfare,
health, wealth, libertie, and yet want grace: nay, the peace of the
wicked is no blessing, but a curse. And though the Lord giue a
man health, wealth, libertie, which be but common blessings,
he may be out of his grace and fauour: seeing the Lord bestowes
these common blessings on those which be his enemies. <hi>Psal.</hi>
73. 12. But though the wicked haue all these common blessings,
they be accursed. And though a man had grace, the fauour and
true loue of God, and had no other health, wealth nor libertie,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:14859:23"/>
yet he were most happy and blessed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him which is, was, &amp;c.</hi> Here he sets down the cause efficient
and the author of these two, <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Peace:</hi> the Author is
God, distinguished into three persons, the <hi>Father, Sonne,</hi> and
<hi>holy Ghost:</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> in these words, <hi>which is, was, and is to come:</hi>
the holy Ghost is noted in these words, <hi>And from the seuen spirits,</hi>
which are before his throne: thirdly, the Sonne in the fift
verse.</p>
            <p>S. <hi>Iohn</hi> in the first place describes the Father by his true nature,
in these words, <hi>Which is, was, and is to come;</hi> in which he alludes
to that, <hi>Exo.</hi> 3. 14. 15. where <hi>Moses</hi> demaunds of God, if the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
should aske who sent him, what he should answer: the Lord
tels him, say, I <hi>am, Ehjeh, Iehouah,</hi> hath sent me: where are two
names to one end, namely, to expresse the nature of God. Now
S. <hi>Iohn</hi> he expounds them here, where he saith, <hi>He which is,
which was, and is to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further, these two names, <hi>Ehjeh, Iehouah,</hi> be two such names
as cannot be translated fully in our English tongue, but are more
significant in their originall Hebrue tongue: for they import
thus much; Grace and peace be from him which is in himselfe,
and from himselfe, a most perfect and absolute substance, which
was, and which is to come; a most absolute perfect simple sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
and essence; so that he is a nature most simple, pure, and
subsisting in and by himselfe, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 4. An idoll is not so, it is
nothing in and of it selfe, but onely in mans braine: it hath no
subsisting and being of it selfe by nature, but by mans art: and
thus the Lord differs from all false gods, seeing he hath his being
in and from himselfe, not of or by any other thing. None other
hath this propertie but God.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> By this we see the nature of all creatures, which is, that
though they haue their subsisting and being (as mans body and
soule) yet it is not from themselues, but from God: not taken out
of his essence, for then they should be God. And the Lord
hath no parts as we haue, but he makes all things out of himselfe
of nothing.</p>
            <p>Seeing then we haue all we haue of God, our bodies,
soules and all we inioy, we must in lieu of recompence, in thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:14859:23"/>
and obedience, giue our selues, soules and bodies to his
seruice, to do his will and pleasure.</p>
            <p>The Lord is most absolute and eternall euery way, without <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
beginning or ending. Angels and the soules of men, they be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall,
but not as absolutely: though they be eternall in that
they shall neuer die, yet had they a beginning. Secondly, they are
eternall, not absolutely, but by participation, for God made
them eternall: but the Lord is most absolutely euery way
eternall.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>From him which is to come.</hi> That is, to iudgement, to iudge all
his creatures, especially men and Angels. That God, which is,
was, which hath his being of, in, and from himself, he shall come
to iudgement. This must we remember and thinke of, that he
which is God of himselfe and by himselfe, which giues vs life
and being, he shall iudge vs: and this will be a meanes to
make vs do our dutie in conscience. But many men flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
saying; God will not come in my time to iudgement: but
though the Lord come not to generall iudgement in this life,
yet he will come in particular iudgement by death in this life.
Thirdly, if we would alwayes remember this, it would bridle
out liues, and make vs keepe a good conscience before God and
all men. <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 24.</p>
            <q>And from the seuen spirits which are before his throne.<note place="margin">Verse 4.</note>
            </q>
            <p>These words commonly are expounded of the Angels of God,
which stand and minister vnto him: but it cannot be meant of
them, for two causes. First, those which are here called seuen spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
from these grace and peace come, but it cannot come from
the holy Angels, which attend to minister before the Lord. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
in this verse, which is a benediction or a salutation of
<hi>Iohn</hi> to the Church, the seuen spirits are set before Iesus Christ
the second person of the Trinitie, which cannot be true of the
Angels, who in no respect can be placed before Christ: therfore
it cannot be vnderstood of the holy Angels. But for my
part I vnderstand it thus, <hi>And from the seuen spirits, &amp;c.</hi> that is,
from the holy Ghost. This exposition is most agreeable to all
the circumstances of the text, and the holy Ghost is called the
seuen spirits: first, because, though he be one in substance, yet he
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:14859:24"/>
is seuen, that is, many in gifts and operations: and for this cause
the spirit of God cals himselfe the seuen spirits. Secondly, he
cals him so, because he sets downe the Father, Sonne, and holy
Ghost, as he saw them in vision. Now S. <hi>Iohn</hi> saw the holy
Ghost in forme of seuen lights in a vision, <hi>Reu.</hi> 4. 5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Which are before the throne.</hi> This he speakes by comparison
taken from earthly kings, which fitting in their thrones, do there
shew their might and maiestie most. So S. <hi>Iohn</hi> he saw God the
Father sitting in a throne by vision,<note place="margin">Reu. 4.</note> and Christ at his right hand,
and before the throne the holy Ghost. Hence it followes, not
that he is inferiour to the Father, and to the Sonne: but by this
comparison and kind of speech, S. <hi>Iohn</hi> sets out the office of the
holy Ghost, which is, to be sent by the Father and Sonne to the
Church, to enlighten the members thereof, and to sanctifie
them.</p>
            <p>Seeing that he ascribes grace and peace from God the father,<note place="margin">Doct. 1.</note>
and also from the seuen spirits, that is, the holy Ghost: hence we
note, the holy Ghost is very God; for from whom grace and
peace proceeds, he is perfect and very God.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> We learne, that we may direct our prayers to the holy Ghost,
for to whom grace and peace is ascribed, to him we may direct
our prayers, seeing he can giue grace. &amp;c. but they be ascribed
to him, and he can giue them, <hi>ergo</hi> we may pray to him for
them.</p>
            <p>There be some which doubt whether we may pray to the
holy Ghost: but they may aswell doubt whether he be God or
not: but they say we haue no example. <hi>Ans.</hi> It is false: for here we
haue an example; for though this grace and peace, &amp;c. be a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
yet in substance it is a prayer as though he had said, O Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Sonne and holy Ghost, let thy grace and peace be vpon the
Church.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
               <hi>Which are before the throne of the Father.</hi> Hence we note, the
holy Ghost is a substance, and a person subsisting, not a quality,
as some Heretikes hold, confessing the Godhead of the Father,
of the Sonne, and denying the Godhead of the holy Ghost. But
here we see, for the holy Ghost, he is a substance and person
subsisting, standing before the throne of the Father, not a gift
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:14859:24"/>
or grace proceeding from God, but a person distinguished from
the Father and the Sonne: the Father he sits on the throne, the
Sonne is on his right hand, the holy Ghost distinguished from
them both, stands before the throne.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And from Iesus Christ.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vers. 5.</note> That is, grace and peace from Iesus
Christ. Where Christ Iesus is ioyned to the Father and the holy
Ghost, in bestowing grace and peace on his Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> Why is Christ, the second person of the Trinitie, placed after
the holy Ghost the third Person? <hi>Answ.</hi> For two causes. First,
Christ is considered two wayes: first, as he is the Sonne of the
Father: secondly, as he is the Mediator of the Church. Now as
he is the Sonne of the Father, he is the second Person in Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and so before the holy Ghost in order. Secondly, as he is
Mediator; and so he is after them both, the Father and the holy
Ghost: <hi>Esa. 61. 1. The Spirit of the Lord is vpon me, hath sent me
to preach.</hi> Where Christ is sent by the holy Ghost to preach, as
he is Mediator, and so as he is sent, in that respect he is after the
holy Ghost.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he is placed after the holy Ghost, because the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of them which pen the Scriptures, is to set them in the last
place of whom they meane to speake last. So <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. he set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
downe the genealogie of Christ from Abraham, though in
all those there was none more excellent then Christ; yet he is in
the last place because of order: the Euangelist meaning to speak
and treat of him, he sets him in the last place, purposing still to
continue his historie of the life and death of Christ. So here S.
<hi>Iohn</hi> he placed Christ in the last place, because he purposed to
continue his historie in speaking of the death and passion of
Christ, and other things which concerne him.</p>
            <p>Now what saith he of Christ? From this fift till the ninth verse
he describes Christ, first, by his offices: secondly, by the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his offices. His offices are three: first, he is set out by his
propheticall office in these words: <hi>which is that faithfull witnesse:</hi>
secondly, by his priestly office: the <hi>first begotten of the dead:</hi> third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by his kingly office: <hi>and that Prince of the kings of the earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">1. Office.</note> his propheticall office. First, he is a <hi>witnesse.</hi> Secondly,
a <hi>faithfull</hi> witnesse. Thirdly, <hi>that</hi> faithfull witnesse. First, he is a
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:14859:25"/>
witnesse, <hi>Esa. 55. 4. I gaue him to be a witnesse to the nations.</hi> In
that he is called a witnesse, there are signified many duties of his
propheticall office: as first, to reueale the will of his Father: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
to certifie the Church of the certaintie of the same: and
in these two stand his whole office propheticall.</p>
            <p>First, to reueale his Fathers will to the Church is his office:
for there is none which knowes his Fathers will, but he which
came from the bosome of the Father, and he hath declared it.
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 18. And he hath not onely declared his Fathers will since
he came in the flesh: but from the beginning he reuealed the
will and word of God. When the Lord rained fire on Sodome
<hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 24. there Iehouah the Father rained downe, by Iehouah
the Sonne. So when the couenant was made to our first parents,
it was made in Christ the promised seed. It was renewed to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham
and the Patriarkes from the Father by the Sonne, as
appeared in the bush,<note place="margin">Exod. 3.</note> where Iehouah appeared: but 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.
there he is called Christ. The Prophets and the Apostles wrote
as they were inspired by Christ, they were but his instruments
to speake and write that he put into them by the holy Ghost.
The matter, and the stile and phrase of the Scripture, all came
from Christ. Nay, when any particular man comes to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the Scriptures, this is by the working of Christ: he opens
their eyes.<note place="margin">Luk. 24.</note> He gaue the disciples vnderstanding as they went to
Emaus, to vnderstand the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>The second duty of Christ,<note place="margin">2. Dutie.</note> is to certifie men of his Fathers
will, and that in conscience of the certainty of his Fathers will.
This certification is generall or particular. When he certifieth
men, that the word written or spoken by man out of the word,
is the word of God, neither nature nor learning can do this,
but it is proper to Christs Propheticall office: and for this he
saith to his disciples,<note place="margin">Ioh. 15.</note> he will send them <hi>the comforter which shall
leade them into all truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here we must know, first, by what meanes he assureth vs: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
the principall cause of this assurance. The meanes, is
the word it selfe. The principall cause, is the operation of the
holy Ghost.</p>
            <p>By this,<note place="margin">1. Point.</note> three points are resolued. First, the Papists aske, how
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:14859:25"/>
a man can come to know,<note place="margin">Obiection.</note> that the Scriptures read and taught
be the word of God?<note place="margin">Answer.</note> 
               <hi>Answ.</hi> We must here haue recourse to the
word, and to the faithfull witnesse, and desire of him his spirit,
and so we shall be able to discerne, and iudge of it: for no natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
man can do it, no naturall man can discerne the things of
God: but he which is enlightened by the Spirit of God, he can.</p>
            <p>Secondly, a man must haue Christ his testimonie of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which is the Scriptures themselues: for in them he setteth
downe this testimonie of the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>But if Christs testimonie be set downe of the Scriptures,<note place="margin">Question.</note> why
do not all men know it?</p>
            <p>Vnlesse a man haue a natural facultie of seeing,<note place="margin">Answer.</note> he cannot dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
the Sunne though it shine: so vnlesse a man haue grace
from Christ to iudge of the Scriptures, he cannot iudge of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:
but if any haue the spirit of discerning, then if he read and mark
the phrase and manner of writing, the stile and authoritie of
the Scriptures, he shall see then in euery line a testimonie of
them giuen by Christ.</p>
            <p>How can a man know the true religion,<note place="margin">2. Point.</note> seeing the Turke,
Papist,<note place="margin">Question.</note> Iew, &amp; Protestant haue their religions, and dye in them?
I answer,<note place="margin">Answer.</note> for to know which is true of these, we must haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to the <hi>faithful witnesse Christ,</hi> and what he saith is true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
that we must hold for true religion. Now Christ he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
testimonie of them in the Scriptures, and the Scriptures be
as a letter sent from heauen to the Church, shewing and testifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which is true religion: not that of the Iew, Turke, or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist,
but of the Christian.</p>
            <p>Sundry men hold diuerse opinion in matters of religion,<note place="margin">3. Point.</note> as
the Iew,<note place="margin">Question.</note> Turke, Papist, &amp; Christian: which is the true opinion?
how is it knowne?<note place="margin">Answer.</note> 
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Still we must haue recourse to the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of truth, the faithful witnesse, and Prophet of the Church:
and he is the iudge of these co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouersies. Now in the Scriptures
if we marke them, we shall see his iudgement, which of these is
true. But if there be diuerse opinions of Scriptures, what must
be iudge? In this diuersitie of opinions, yea of the Scriptures
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, we must still haue recourse to the Scriptures &amp; if we
note the circumstances, the manner of writing: if we conferre
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:14859:26"/>
Scripture with Scripture, we shall easily find out the true sense
and meaning: for the Lord sets out in them his iudgment plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and fully.</p>
            <p>The second certificate is particular, belonging to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall
office of Christ: which is, to certifie men in particular,
that the promise of the Gospell belongs to them, as to <hi>Peter,
Iohn,</hi> &amp;c. that he is the child of God, and that euerlasting life
belongs to any child in particular: and this is done especially by
the word, not read, but preached, being ioyned with the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the Spirit. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. We haue the spirit of Christ, which
testifies with our spirit we be the sonnes of God. Now if this be
the dutie of Christ, to certifie men in particular, that euerlasting
life belongs to me, or to any particular man, then their doctrine
is damnable who deny this, seeing it is the proper office of the
propheticall office of Christ. And in this he differs from al other
Prophets and Apostles which be witnesses: for they can wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
onely outwardly to the eare, but he can speake and testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
to the conscience: neither can any of them certifie any man
particularly, though their ministerie tend to that end.</p>
            <p>Christ is not onely a witnesse, but a <hi>faithfull witnesse:</hi> first, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he testifies not his owne will, but his which sent him:
namely, his Fathers. Secondly, he testifies all his Fathers will,
neither adding nor detracting from it. Thirdly, because he tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
it as he receiued it sincerely, in the same manner in which
he receiued it, not altering, changing, or deprauing his Fathers
will.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That faithfull witnesse.</hi> The Lord hath sundrie faithfull wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
as the Prophets, Apostles, the Church, nay, the Sunne
and Moone, <hi>Psal.</hi> 89. vers. 37. but Christ alone is that faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
witnes, whereby he is distinguished from all other witnesses:
for he is aboue all other, his witnesse is authenticall, sufficient
of it selfe, &amp; needs no confirmation. The witnes of the Apostles
and Prophets, be not authenticall and certaine, but as they
consent with Christs witnesse. Secondly, he is that witnesse,
because he is the Lord of that house whereof he giues witnesse,
namely the Church, but the Apostles and Prophets are but ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:14859:26"/>
Thirdly, Christ his witnesse is inward, it assures and speakes
to the conscience: but the witnes of men, as of the Prophets and
Apostles, is outward onely; it comes to the eares, it neuer binds
and assures the conscience: so that for that prerogatiue he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
all witnesses, and here called, <hi>THAT faithfull wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Whereas Christ the Doctor and Prophet of the Church,<note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note>
is called a faithfull witnesse, we learne, that all Ministers must
be faithfull witnesses: for euery Minister of the Gospell when he
preacheth out of Gods word, he is in the roome of Christ,
speaketh that which Christ should speake, therefore he must be
like Christ, a faithfull witnesse.</p>
            <p>2. Now that they may be faithful witnesses, they must deliuer the
testimony of Christ aboue all other things, and before all testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of man, in the office of their ministery. So, it was meate
and drinke to Christ to teach his Fathers will. So <hi>Abraham</hi> his
eldest seruant shewed his fidelitie, in that he would not eate or
drinke till he had done his maisters message, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 33. So the
Ministers must haue care, first to teach the wil of God aboue all
things: secondly, they must testifie all the will of God concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
matters of saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. As among men, we count him a faithful
witnes which testifies all the truth, and no more but the truth: so
they be faithfull Ministers, which testifie the whole will of God
in things belonging to saluation, neither adding nor detracting.
So <hi>Paul</hi> cleared himselfe,<note place="margin">Act. 20. 26, 27</note> that he was free from all mens blood,
seeing he deliuered the whole will of God, in matters necessary
for saluation, and kept nothing backe.</p>
            <p>3. He must neither adde nor take away, much lesse in any
case depraue the word of God: and this is the true marke of a
faithfull witnesse.</p>
            <p>In the Church of Rome a man may heare things concerning
morall vertues handled soundly: but come to faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
matters of saluation, they take away one part and adde
another to the Scriptures: they hold the Creed in word, yet in
deede they deny the same, as by their doctrine it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.</p>
            <p>4. The true witnesse must deliuer the testimony of Christ,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:14859:27"/>
in that manner he receiues it: namely, in a spirituall manner, in a
plaine easie manner, in a familiar kind of speech: that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of euery hearer may be moued. When we seeke to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
the word, we do corrupt the same: and as trades men and
huxters, we cannot be content to declare the word in a plaine,
easie, familiar speech, but as they set out their wares with ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
blowing, spicing, &amp;c. so we set a gloze on the word,
and make merchandize of it. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 17.</p>
            <p>This is a common sinne in this age: for we teach the word
but in an humane manner. Men speake and preach the word
but onely to shew their owne wit, learning, reading and gifts:
but he which deliuereth not the word in that maner he ought,
and wherein he receiues it, he is a false witnesse.</p>
            <p>Christ he is a faithfull witnesse, and <hi>that faithfull witnesse:</hi> then
we see the damnable practise of most men now adayes, for they
heare the word continually preached, and reade the same: yet
the Prophet cryes out,<note place="margin">Isa. 53. 1.</note> Who hath beleeued our sayings? None
feare the threatnings of the law, none beleeue the promises of
the Gospell. What an heauie and horrible thing is this, that we
should not beleeue the promises of saluation, nor feare the
threats of the law for our sins: seeing it is the doctrine preached
and confirmed by the testimonie of Christ Iesus, the true and
faithfull witnesse of the Fathers will to man? This is to make
Christ a lyer, to make him a false Prophet, and giue him the lye.</p>
            <p>By the consideration of this, that Christ Iesus is the faithful
witnesse, that the doctrine deliuered out of his word, is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by his testimonie: must we take heed that we feare and tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
at the threates of the law, that we beleeue assuredly the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of the Gospell: for they which will not beleeue, haue their
portion in the lake of fire and brimstone, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 21. 8.</p>
            <p>Againe, seeing Christ Jesus is that faithfull witnesse, which
giueth testimonie to mens co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sciences in particular of their sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
this teacheth vs to beleeue the promises of the Gospell,
that they belong to each of vs in particular, as to Iohn, Peter,
&amp;c. and euery true member of Christ: for he is the true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
witnesse, he alone giueth testimonie to mens consciences.
Now though it be against all sense, yet we must beleeue him,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:14859:27"/>
seeing he is true: and if we do not, we make him a false witnes,
giuing him the lye.</p>
            <p>Then it is no presumption (as the Papists say) to beleeue our
election and saluation in particular:<note place="margin">Vse</note> nay, it is an horrible sinne
not to beleeue it: seeing Christ a most faithfull witnesse, testifies
the same to our consciences by his holy Spirit. Nay, for this end
to perswade euery man in particular, he appointed his Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
bread and wine in the Supper, and water in Baptisme,
that euery one might particularly receiue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; particularly be
assured of the same. For in that he offers them, he doth, as if he
should say, I offer you in them life euerlasting. Then to doubt of
this, that we may assuredly perswade our selues in particular, of
our owne saluation, is to call into question, whether Christ be a
true witnesse, a true and faithfull Prophet or not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the first begotten of the dead.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vers. 5.</note> Here in these words is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the second office of Christ: namely, his Priestly office.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The first begotten of the dead:</hi> He alludeth in these words to
the estate of the families among the Iewes: for as among them,
he which was first borne, and eldest of the familie, had many
priuiledges and preheminences, as of the Lordshippe
of the Priesthood, of double portion, &amp;c. so Christ which
is compared to the eldest and first borne, he hath his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledges:
yea euen Christ crucified, he hath his prerogatiues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the dead, aboue all that are dead. So Paule calleth him
the first and beginning of the dead: and after expounds it, that
he might in all things haue the preheminence. <hi>Colos.</hi> 1. 18.</p>
            <p>The second priuiledge is, that Christ being dead, was the
first which rose from death to life: for none rose from death to
life before him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob. Lazarus, Moses</hi> &amp; <hi>Elias</hi> in the mount, they had their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
restored the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againe: yea <hi>Lazarus</hi> rose to life againe before
Christ. <hi>Answ. Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> receiued their bodies againe,
<hi>Lazarus</hi> also liued againe, but these returned againe to their
former miserie; as <hi>Lazarus</hi> he rose from death to die againe: so
<hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> tooke to them their bodies againe, not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into eternall happinesse, but to their former miserie: but
Christ he rose from death to eternall happinesse, and rose not
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:14859:28"/>
to die any more, but his resurrection is the first steppe to eternal
life and felicitie.</p>
            <p>The second priuiledge which he hath aboue all the dead,<note place="margin">The second priuiledge.</note> is,
that he by his owne power, and by the vertue of his Godhead
raised his manhood. But all that rise to life, saue Christ, they are
raised by vertue of his resurrection, not by their owne power.
None can raise themselues, but by the vertue of that mysticall
vnion betweene Christ the head, and vs the members. For as
the first fruites being offered to the Lord, they sanctified all the
rest: so Christ Iesus the first fruites of the dead, did by his resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
sanctifie and make acceptable all our resurrections.</p>
            <p>In this is a notable comfort for all Gods children,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> against the
immoderate feare of death: for if <hi>Iohn</hi> had said, Christ is the first
borne among the liuing, it had bene a great comfort: for then
had he shewed that we be his familie on earth; that the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
of his children on earth is his familie, and he is the head of
them, he our elder brother. But in that he saith, the <hi>first begotten
of the dead,</hi> here is an excellent comfort: for the Lord sheweth
thereby, that he hath speciall regard euen of the dead of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie:
for the companie of his members which be dead they be
his familie, and in this familie, Christ is numbred as the elder
brother. And in that respect he hath a double right: first, of a
King: secondly, of a Priest. Of a King, in making the dead to
obey his voyce, and to rise from the dead at his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement.
Secondly, of a Priest, to offer himselfe an acceptable sacrifice to
his father: and also by his death to sanctifie and perfume the
death of the godly, so that their death is to them no death. For
as the first fruites sanctified the rest of the corne, so Christ the
first fruits of the dead, he sanctifieth the death of al his children:
so that death sanctified by his death is no curse to the godly, the
graue is not a prison, but a pleasant chamber of rest.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And Prince of the kings of the earth.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The third title and office of Christ.</note> Here is the third, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the kingly office of our Sauiour Christ. He is called a Prince
of the kings of the earth, in two respects: first, as he is God, the
Sonne of God, and so King together with the Father and the
holy Ghost, gouerning all things by his diuine power, being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
to them, Secondly, as he is Mediator, as he is God and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:14859:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
man in two natures, he is called a Prince of kings. So <hi>Mat. 28.
All power is giuen me of the Father,</hi> not as he is God, but as he
is God and man the Mediator, or Godincarnate. So the Lord
gaue him a <hi>name at which euery knee shold bow,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 6.</note> euen as he is Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator.
And of these two, I take it, he meaneth the second sense
here, where he cals Christ a Prince of the kings of the earth, in
regard as he is God and man, or God incarnate the Mediator.</p>
            <p>Now Christ being a King, he must needes haue a kingdome,
which cannot stand in the might and pollicie of man, as earthly
kingdomes do: but it is spirituall, it stands in the heart and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
of men: his lawes they bind the soule and conscience
to obedience. And this is his priuiledge, which can be giuen to
no creature, man or Angell, to rule and raigne spiritually in the
heart and conscience.</p>
            <p>This spirituall kingdome of Christ is exercised in the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
and soules of men by the word of Christ, not by dint of
sword, or force of armes: but he is a King which carieth his
sword in his mouth, euen his word, by which he rules and raigns
in our hearts: he rules with the <hi>rod of his mouth. Esa.</hi> 11. that is,
by his word, by which he speaketh to mens consciences.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prince of the Kings of the earth.</hi> So is Christ in two respects.
First, because he (and he alone) can and is able to giue lawes to
bind the consciences of men, yea of the greatest Monarch in
the world: none so high which is not subiect to his lawes. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
he is called King of the Princes of the earth, because he
hath soueraigne power ouer all Kings and Potentates, to saue
and to destroy: for not onely hath he power to make a law to
bind their consciences, but also if they keepe it, to saue them; if
they breake his law, he hath power to destroy them, be they
what they may be. He hath the key of heauen to open and to
shut, none can controle him. <hi>Reuel</hi> 3. 7. He can if he will, leade
them to life and saue them, or else leaue them to their owne
mind, and so destroy them.</p>
            <p>Seeing our Sauior Christ is a Prince of the greatest monarks
of the world,<note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note> and is farre aboue them: we must then with all feare
&amp; trembling reuerence his high Maiestie. We reuerence Kings
on earth, shewing great dutifulnesse to them: then what reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:14859:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ow we to him which is Prince and Lord of all the kings of
the earth? We cannot conceiue what reuerence we owe vnto
him, which is placed in the throne of all maiestie: we must shew
our reuerence to this Prince, by hearing his word with trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
and beleeuing hearts, reuerently and with conscience: we
must not dare to take his high name into our mouthes without
great reuerence: the very Kings must shew reuerence vnto this
King of kings. But the common practise of men doth shew what
litle reuerence we haue of Christ: for we haue his name in our
mouthes at euery word, to prophane the same, to talke of it in
iesting: and without all reuerence we tosse it in our mouthes like
a tenice ball.</p>
            <p>Seeing he is King of Kings,<note place="margin">Vse. 2.</note> we must giue him absolute obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.
Princes must be obeyed so farre as they obey him, but
he must be obeyed without exception absolutely, and not onely
absolutely, but willingly must he be obeyed, and without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion,
freely, yea personally, perpetually, and in all his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements.</p>
            <p>Men they will say they beleeue in Christ, as he is their Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
but that is not enough, we must beleeue in him as he is the
King of Princes. That we therefore may beleeue in him, as he is
King of Kings, we must do him absolute obedience, do his will
in all things: and vnlesse we beleeue in him so, we cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
in him, no not as he is a Sauior: for these two go together.
Now this duty and obedience we owe to him, must be done to
him as we learne out of his word, read and preached in the
Church.</p>
            <p>Seeing he is King of kings,<note place="margin">Vse. 3.</note> al princes, kings, &amp; pote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tates must
do him seruice: for they be all inferiour and subiect to him.
Psal. 2. the three last verses: <hi>Be wise now, O ye Kings: be learned ye
Iudges of the earth. Kisse the son, &amp;c.</hi> that is, inwardly reuerence,
and outwardly obey him. This their subiection must be she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
to Christ their King, in the gouernement of their
kingdomes, for they must make and frame their lawes after the
lawes of Christ Iesus, they must make lawes, exercise iudgement,
keepe Courts, Assises, begin and end, and continue warre, by his
commaundements. And seeing all Kings are in subiection to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:14859:29"/>
Christ, as their subiects be to them, they must therefore be gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and directed in all the matters of their kingdomes by the
counsell of Christ: so <hi>Dauid</hi> saith, <hi>Thy lawes, O Lord, are my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellers.</hi>
Psal. 119. 24.</p>
            <p>If Christ be soueraigne King,<note place="margin">Vse. 4.</note> and aboue all other Kings, then
all other must plant and set vp in their kingdomes the religion
of Christ, else how can they shew they be Christs subiects: then
it followes, that they may not be of what religion they
list.<note place="margin">Luke 14. 23.</note> And this is shewed in the parable of the mariage; for when
the supper was ready, he sent his seruants to compell them to
his supper: which may be vnderstood of the magistrate, whose
duty is to compell men to the true Religion and profession of
the Gospell of Christ.</p>
            <p>Seeing Christ is King of Kings,<note place="margin">Vse 5.</note> and no man hath this priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
but he: hence we learne, that Kings on earth, they in
their dominions are soueraigne kings, ouer all persons &amp; causes,
because as he is King of Kings absolutely, so they are vnder him
kings, and haue supremacy in their kingdomes. Then we see the
presumption and arrogancy of the Pope and sea of Rome, who
would be supreame head of the whole earth, and King of all
Kings, to put Christ out of his office, and sit in his roome ouer al
at his pleasure.</p>
            <p>Seeing Christ is King of all Kings,<note place="margin">Vse. 6.</note> we must not be discoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
when we be called to suffer any affliction or crosse, seeing
that though the tyrants and Kings of the earth rage and bend
their force to hurt vs, yet we haue a King aboue them all, who
can stay and bridle them, and if he please, confound and bruise
them in peeces: they cannot do any thing but that which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
them to do, for he rules and raignes in the midst of all these,
where they are the thickest, and would do most malice, and can
do to them as pleaseth him.</p>
            <p>Now followes the second part of Christs description by his
execution of his offices, which consist in foure workes: the first
contained in these words, <hi>Vnto him which loued vs:</hi> the second
in these, <hi>Which washed vs in his bloud:</hi> the other two, in the two
last verses which follow.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Which loued vs.</hi> That is, the Churches of Asia, and by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:14859:30"/>
all other Churches, being parts of the true Church.</p>
            <p>The loue of Christ hath three degrees:<note place="margin">Three degrees of Christs loue.</note> the first is called a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
loue, whereby he loues all his creatures, as they be his
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> creatures: and this loue is common to all his creatures.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The second degree is the loue of mankind, in that he was
content to become a redeemer for mankind, not for any other
creature, no not for the Angels, which fell as well as man.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third degree, which is most principall, is that whereby
he loues his elect and chosen children, which is that loue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he accepts of them to life euerlasting.</p>
            <p>This third degree hath two parts: for it is taken first for the
purpose of his decree to loue: secondly, for the action or decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of his loue.<note place="margin">Rom. 9. 13.</note> For the first, <hi>as I haue loued Iacob and hated E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sau:</hi>
that is, I haue purposed to loue the one and hate the other.
Secondly, for the declaration of his purpose to loue. Thirdly, for
the action and for the declaration of his loue and speciall fauor
in speciall benefits. 1. Ioh. 3. 1. <hi>Behold what singular loue God hath
shewed on vs:</hi> nothing the declaration of his purpose to loue vs, in
giuing his son for vs. So in this verse is meant Gods special loue,
or the declaration of his purpose to loue vs in speciall benefits.</p>
            <p>Now whereas <hi>S. Iohn</hi> placeth this in the first place of all the
benefites of Christ,<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> 
               <hi>That he loued vs,</hi> he would teach vs, that this
loue is the very ground of mans redemption, the very cause of
Gods liking and fauor to man. Then there is no foreseene faith:
away with foreseene workes: for he loued vs first, and that alone
is the cause and ground of our election and saluation.</p>
            <p>But it may be obiected:<note place="margin">Obiection.</note> The loue of God, as also of man, res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects
the goodnesse of things loued: so we loue a thing
because it is good, and when it is euill we hate it.</p>
            <p>There is great difference betweene the loue of the creature
and the Creator.<note place="margin">Answer.</note> The creature loues the thing, because he seeth
it is good: but God the Creator, he first loues the creature: and
hence it comes, that it is good, because he loues it.</p>
            <p>2. Whereas <hi>S. Iohn</hi> and all the Churches of Asia, as other
true Churches, do beleeue and are assured that Christ loues
them, (for that <hi>S. Iohn</hi> taketh for graunted) this should moue
all men to haue this care, to labour aboue all things to be rooted
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:14859:30"/>
and grounded in loue, seeing he places that in the first place.
This we do when we are assured in heart and conscience by the
working of Gods spirit,<note place="margin">Ephes. 3. 17. 18, 19.</note> that he loues vs in Christ: so that he
which takes away the assurance of Gods loue to vs in Christ,
takes away the very ground of our saluation.</p>
            <p>Now that we may haue this loue of God, we must in all our
duties to God and man, draw neare to God, keeping a good
conscience before God &amp; all men: and so if we loue God, he wil
come to vs, stay and dwell in vs. And if we would haue his loue
to be plentifully shed in our hearts, then we must draw neare to
him by loue,<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 5.</note> and he will draw neare to vs: for he louing vs first,
if we increase in that loue to him, then will he double his loue
to vs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And washed vs from our sinnes in his blood.</hi> Here is the second
benefit and action of Christ to his Church, which is, first the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of sinnes: secondly, the mortification of sinnes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Washed,</hi> Here he sheweth, that the sinnes of men are as filthy
spots in their soules: and after he confesseth the vile estate of the
Church and euery member thereof, in that he saith, they were
so washed, For washing presupposeth filthinesse before, and a
corrupted estate: and so should we by their example learne to
consider our owne estate, how that our soules and bodies be
spotted and defiled with sins originall and actuall. So did <hi>Dauid</hi>
Psal. 51. most sensibly and excellently feele his owne wants, and
see his miserable estate, when he desired the Lord to wash him
thorowly: confessing thereby his soule and body was foule, stai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and polluted with sinne: and addes <hi>thoroughly,</hi> not once and
so inough, bnt wash me againe and againe, thoroughly till I be
cleane, and cleanse me, rince, bathe, swill me in the blood of
Christ, to be purged and cleansed from all my sinnes.</p>
            <p>In which words he sheweth his exceeding feeling of his own
miseries, how fouly he was defiled: so should we labour to see
how the spots of sinne are deeply stucke in our soules; they be
fast set, so that one washing will not serue, but we must be rin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
bathed and cleansed by the blood of Christ: for it is not the
hand of any man or Angell which can wash away these spots,
nor any thing they can giue vs, but onely Christ Iesus, whose
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:14859:31"/>
finger alone dipped in his owne blood can wash away our spots
of sinne.</p>
            <p>The consideration whereof, should make vs consider our
wretched estate, and often to repent vs of our sins, to take heed
of sin, which staines vs so. We must labour to haue our hearts
purged and cleansed by the blood of Christ; and till we haue
them so purged, neither our faith, obedience, loue, or any thing
we do is acceptable to God.</p>
            <p>The first part of this benefit of Christ, containes the remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our sinnes, the taking away of the punishment and the
guilt due to them: the second part, is the mortification of sin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Which hath washed vs from all, &amp;c.</hi> He addeth these words,
to shew that if any beleeue truly, he hath pardon of all his
sinnes, without any restraint or limitation of these or those
sinnes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>By his blood.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Obiection.</note> How can blood wash away filthinesse? nay, it
rather defiles a man. <hi>Answ.</hi> This washing stands not in the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the blood, but in the merit thereof: for the blood of
Christ shed is lost, and God knowes what is become of it,
whatsoeuer the Papists say; but the merite of it washeth
away sinnes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> But why doth Christs blood, rather then any other mans
blood, as <hi>Peter, Iohn,</hi> &amp;c? <hi>Answ.</hi> Because that blood was the
blood of God, (not of the Godhead) but of him who was both
God and man; for these two natures being vnited together,
make but one person: and so it may be called the blood of God,
as <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>God redeemed vs by his blood,</hi> that is Christ, God
and man, God-man, or God incarnate: and so it being the blood
of God, is more meritorious then the blood of any creature
whatsoeuer. Besides I answer: Christ was appointed by God to
be a publike person, to be suretie for all mankind: but no man
can be so, to be in the roome of the whole company of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kind.
Then damnable is the doctrine of the Papists, who hold, the
blood of Martyrs can merit for other: for seeing they be but pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
men, they cannot profit any other.</p>
            <p>By <hi>blood</hi> we must vnderstand the passion of Christ, being a
part for the whole; and withall we must remember his fulfilling
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:14859:31"/>
of the law: for in his suffering he fulfilled the whole law, and in
fulfilling the law he suffered, and these two cannot be seuered:
so that this containes the whole obedience of Christ, partly in
suffering, partly in fulfilling the law.</p>
            <p>S. <hi>Iohn</hi> addeth these words, and sets downe these two bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings,
to draw men to loue and like this booke, to make them
reade and take delight in it. Now all of vs will say, God
loues me, and hath pardoned my sins in Christ: then we should
shew our loue againe to him, in taking delight in hearing and
reading the word of God, set downe in this or any other booke
of Scripture. And if we perswade our selues God hath loued vs,
we must then offer vp to him in signe of loue againe, our selues,
soules and bodies, to serue him, to do him obedience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.
in regard of recompence to his mercies and loue shed out and
shewed vnto vs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And made vs Kings and Priests to God and his Father, euen his
Father.</hi> In these words is set downe the third action, worke and
benefite of Christ bestowed on his Church: he hath made euery
true member of it a <hi>King</hi> and a <hi>Priest.</hi> Better to vnderstand these
words, we must consider in them foure points: first, the dignitie
and excellency of all true beleeuers and members of Christ,
<hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Priests.</hi> Secondly, when they be made, namely, <hi>hath
made,</hi> speaking in the time past: noting that true beleeuers are
<hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Priests.</hi> Thirdly, the maner how, we are not created
such, neither borne to be such, but he hath <hi>made</hi> vs such. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to whom, <hi>to God, euen the father.</hi> First, our dignitie, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie
of all true beleeuers and members of Christ, hath two
heads: first, Kings: secondly, Priests.</p>
            <p>They are called kings, not in regard of an earthly kingdome:
for the condition of most beleeuers on earth is base; but in regard
of a spirituall kingdome, and in respect of the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen:
for the Lord he giues them this title and interest to be
Kings, to haue right to the kingdome of heauen in Christ. So
our Sauiour Christ speakes to his Disciples:<note place="margin">Luke 12. 31.</note> Feare not litle flock,
it is your Fathers pleasure to giue you the kingdome. The mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Christ are said to haue interest and title to the kingdome
of heauen, in these respects: first, because by Christ they be
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:14859:32"/>
Lords and conquerors of all these enemies, sin, Satan, the world,
death, hell, and our owne flesh. Secondly, because in and by
Christ they are partakers of the kingdome of heauen, they haue
interest into it, and right to the kingdome of happinesse: for they
receiue of Christ grace for grace, glory for glory, felicitie and
happinesse, for glory, happinesse and felicitie. Thirdly, because
they be made Lords of all creatures (except good Angels and
the Church). 1. Cor. 3. 21. <hi>God is all in all to them:</hi> all things are
theirs, they Gods; and we haue interest to all his creatures in
heauen and earth by Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> But if Christ be King and al his me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers, how do they differ?
<hi>Answ.</hi> In two points: first, Christ he is the sonne of God by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
therefore a King by nature, and so his inheritance belongs
to him by nature; but the members of Christ are the sonnes of
God by adoption in his Son, so that our right to that kingdome
is not by nature but by adoption. Secondly, Christ he is King
ouer all creatures whatsoeuer, ouer the Angels and the Church,
and he is absolute King ouer all, and hath his regiment in the
hearts and consciences of men, and can by his word bind them:
but his members they be not vniuersall kings, for they haue not
superioritie aboue good Angels and the Church, neither are
they absolute kings as he is: neither by themselues, but by
Christ Iesus, and as they participate with Christ in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
            <p>The second part of our dignitie stands in this, that we be
<hi>Priests:</hi> in that we be consecrated and set apart by Christ to the
worship and seruice of God here in this life, to serue him in spirit
and truth, and in the life to come, eternally to serue and praise
him.</p>
            <p>Christ he is Priest, so are we, but yet there is difference.
First, Christ he is an externall and reall Priest of the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which offers vp a true, reall and externall sacrifice to God
the Father for vs: we are not reall and externall Priests, but spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall,
offering vp spirituall sacrifice. And Christ hath this priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
to offer vp a reall, corporall and substantial sacrifice in the
new testament: we do not so. When any member of Christ giues
an almes, he offers a sacrifice to God, not a corporall sacrifice,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:14859:32"/>
but spirituall euery way. Againe, note this, that our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Christ he is a perfect Priest, and offers vp a perfect sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice;
but we being imperfect, do offer vp an imperfect sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
tainted and blemished with sinne, but accepted as perfect
for the worthinesse of Christs sacrifice.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we be Kings and Prists in this life: for, as in the
entrance into an earthly kingdome there be degrees, as first, to
giue one title to it: secondly, to giue him possession of it, which
is more then to giue one title onely: so Gods children they haue
the right giuen them of the kingdome of heauen in this life: and
as in the giuing of possession of a kingdome, there be two de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees:
first, the beginning of the possession: secondly, the full
enioying and perfect possessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: so we haue the beginning of the
possession of the kingdome of heauen in this life:<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 27.</note> which stands
in righteousnesse, ioy and peace: and they which haue these,
haue the kingdome of God begun in them.</p>
            <p>The second part and degree is after this life, which is the full
fruition and possession of the kingdome of heauen: but in all the
true members of Christ it is begunne here, and accomplished
there. And as we be kings in this world, so we must be Priestes
too, in offering spirituall sacrifice to God, and dedicating and
consecrating our selues to his seruice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hath made vs.</hi> True beleeuers be Kings and Priests, not by
nature, neither borne such, nor by creation, or birth, or bloud
are they such, or by any other priuiledge they haue fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. How
then? As earthly Kings and Priests were made in the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
so are spirituall Kings and Priests in the new: the King
was elected and ordained by a solemne calling: so the Priest by
a solemne election: so are the Kings and Priests which be spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall,
by a diuine calling. In which calling, note two things.
First, Christ giueth his members right to his owne kingdome,
to be Kings and Priests; yet not so, that they can execute the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment
sustained by Christ, and do the office of a King and
Priest as it is done by Christ, but because they belong to them
in part, and they haue the benefite of them both redounding to
them wholly.</p>
            <p>And this right they haue, is brought to passe in the couenant
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:14859:33"/>
of grace. For the Lord in it promiseth, that he for his part will
giue to the true beleeuers in Christ Iesus, his Sonne with
all his benefits, as he giues them this, to be kings and priests. For
euery thing which belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs to Christ as he is head of the Church,
belongs to his seruants as members, and he imparts it to them
in some sort.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in the appointing of kings, they must be annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
so must we be annointed, <hi>Psal.</hi> 45. Christ was annointed
aboue his fellowes: but yet his members they are also annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
he in greater measure, his members in lesse measure, yet by
the same oyle with him, which is the vnction of the holy Ghost.
<hi>We haue receiued the annointing of Christ. 1. Iohn</hi> 2. 7. And
the Lord he bids the wicked not to touch his annointed, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
not onely his seruants,<note place="margin">Psal. 105. 15.</note> 
               <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and the Patriarkes,
but his true members. We haue the same spirit Christ had in his
manhood, though not in the same measure. And the Lord he
giues vs these gifts of the spirit signified by this oyle, to this end,
that we may be fit kings &amp; priests. So that first he giues vs right
to a kingdome: and then, he giues vs gifts to discharge our
dutie.</p>
            <p>4. To whom hath he made vs kings and priests? <hi>to God, and
the Father, euen his Father.</hi> Now men might haue said: If all
his members be kings, then all may liue as they list. But he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
they be kings, but to God: shewing, that the interest they
haue giuen to them to the kingdome of heauen, it is giuen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
that they may be kings and priests to Gods glorie, to his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
and seruice, and to shew, that all the interest belongs to
God absolutely, to vs by him in Christ.</p>
            <p>Lastly, he addeth God and his <hi>Father,</hi> which expounds the
former word <hi>God,</hi> for it is not taken for his nature absolutely,
but for the first Person, God euen his Father. Which sheweth,
that they must not liue as they list: for they be made kings to the
honour and seruice of God the Father, who is here named a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
not because he is aboue the Sonne and holy Ghost, for
they be equall; but because he is the first person in order, and
the fountaine of the Deitie: from it, it is deriued to the Son and
holy Ghost.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:14859:33"/>
Now after the meaning of the words, followe the vses.
First, whereas all the true members of Christ be kings and
priests in this life, we are taught how we must carie our selues:
namely, as enemies to them which be of the kingdome of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
sinne, the world and the flesh: we must be deadly and
sworne enemies to them, we must haue no concord nor amitie
with them. For if we be kings of the kingdome of grace, then
we must be enemies to them which belong to the kingdome of
darknesse:<note place="margin">Ephes. 5. 6.</note> there must be no fellowship between light and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
Now that we may so carie our selues as enemies, we must
first haue care to keepe guard to defend our selues as kings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all our enemies, sinne, Satan, our owne flesh, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticements
of the world. As Kings protect their kingdomes, so
must we stand on our guard, defend our soules and bodies, and
euery facultie and part of them, our wils, affections, thoughts
and inclinations, 1. <hi>Ioh. 5. 18. He which is borne of God keepeth
himselfe,</hi> (as with watch and ward) that sinne or Satan <hi>touch him
not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 We must make war and enter combat against Satan, sinne,
our owne flesh, all our spirituall enemies, the corruptions of our
nature, and all the inticements of the world. We must make no
truce with them, because they will neuer be reconciled, so long
as we haue interest into the kingdome of heauen.</p>
            <p>3 We must labour to kill and destroy these our enemies, as
much as possibly we can, by that power we haue from Christ
our head: we must kill and crucifie the corruption of our owne
hearts, that is, our owne sinnes. We must like a valiant king,
seeke to haue the bloud of these enemies, and seeke to conquer
and vanquish Satan, his power and might, the world and our
owne corruption.</p>
            <p>4 If we be kings in this life,<note place="margin">Vse. 2.</note> we must become Lords and rule
ouer our selues: our soules and bodies must be brought into sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection
and order: for in this, that we be kings of our selues, we
shew especially that we be kings in this life. We must not haue
rule of the whole world, but be ruling and maistering our owne
corruptions and affections, bringing them into subiection and
order: herein stands our kingdome in this world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:14859:34"/>
If a man were Prince ouer the whole earth, and yet could not
rule himselfe, he were but a poore Prince, nay he were no Prince
indeed: but though a man had not so much as a foote of ground
in this world, and could rule and maister himselfe, his thoughts
and affections, this man were a valiant king.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Seeing we be kings, we must do the duty of Iudges, for kings
they be as absolute Iudges, and they must execute iudgement.
In the day of iudgement we shall be iudges,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6. 2.</note> but we must be iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
in this world, and we must not iudge other men, but we must
be our owne iudges. Wherefore as iudges summon, arraigne,
condemne, &amp;c. so must we summon and arraigne, yea iudge and
examine our selues, call our selues to account, and as guilty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
condemne our selues, acknowledging we be worthy to be
cast into eternal damnation with the Diuell and his Angels: and
withall pleade for pardon, approch to the throne of grace and
forgiuenesse: and in these we shew our selues vpright iudges, and
and by this meanes we shall be freed from the iudgement to
come.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10. 31.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> If we be kings by Christ, we must cary our selues as kings,
couragiously &amp; constantly in the afflictions and miseries which
we shall suffer for Christs sake: for herein stands the royalty of a
king, that he beares couragiously and constantly all the troubles
which befall him: so must we in the afflictions and troubles of
this life which we suffer for Christ, shew our selues, in suffering
them, to be kings and conquerors.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Seeing we be spirituall kings, we must aboue all things labor
and seek to haue that our right and heritance, to be possessors of
our kingdome. Must we so? then we must not haue our hearts
glued and fast tied to the things of this world: but we must so
vse this world, as though we vsed it not. If a King should lay
downe his crowne, and go and become a shepheard, or of some
manuall trade, all men would maruell at it: so when we fasten
our selues to these worldly things, we do as it were cast aside
our kingly crowne, and abase our selues. But we must euer
haue one foote fixed in heauen, striuing to come to our inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
there.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Seeing all the true members of Christ be kings and priests,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:14859:34"/>
this should be an inducement to all backward persons, to moue
them and stirre them forward to christian religion, and not to
account of it as precisenesse, seeing that by it we come to haue
right and interest to the kingdome of heauen, to be Lords of all
creatures. For why should we not esteeme of the Gospell as a
most precious iewell, seeing that we which are vassalles of Satan
and fire-brands of hell (as all men are by nature) become the
members of Christ, yea Kings and Priests to God? And seeing
this is effected by the ministery of the Gospel, this should moue
vs to embrace it, to loue and like it, seeing it brings vs such an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
benefit, and not to misname it as we do, by reprochfull
termes. Yea verily, the consideration of this, should make the
Ministers of the word to take all paines to preach the word, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by it they make men to become of vassalles of Satan the true
members of Christ, and heires of the kingdome of heauen. In
this world for a man to consecrate and establish one in a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
it is a thing of great honour: is it not of greater honour, to
consecrate one to become king of heauen and earth, to be heire
of the kingdome of heauen? Now that this is done in the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of the Gospel, when by the word preached we are conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
made to beleeue in Christ, and to repent of our sinnes: this
I say should stirre and pricke forward the Ministers of the word,
to labour to win men to Christ, and to make them kings and
priests to God his father.</p>
            <p>There also is matter of comfort to the godly: for seeing they
be Kings and Priestes in the kingdome of Christ, if a man be in
the crosse and affliction, which is a great griefe, yet let him know
to his comfort, that though he be so handled, &amp; it appeareth not
what he shal be, yet he is a king, and that he shall be and is heire
to the kingdome of heauen. If a man be in sicknesse, he must
consider it is but Gods messenger to call him out of this world,
to the possession of a kingdome. If a man be in the trouble and
vexation of mind, and of his owne conscience: if he be tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
fearefully with his sins, yet he must be content, the Lord wil
giue him a happy issue; he must know he is a king, and therefore
shall one day haue conquest ouer sin, Satan and his owne cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
yea ouer all his enemies whatsoeuer. If a man be in the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:14859:35"/>
heat of persecution, so that he is turmoiled and tossed from post
to pillar, then flesh and blood cannot brooke it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet he is a king:
though he in persecution be killed and put to death, euen then
let him consider he is a most valiant conquerour. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 37. In
the pang of death when nature must needs be dissolued, and
soule and body separated, then we must remember that we be
kings in Christ, and so we shall not feare death, but know it is
but a way and easie passage to the ful possession of our kingdom.
Thus much in that we are kings.</p>
            <p>In that all the members of Christ be priests,<note place="margin">Vses that we<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re Priests.</note> not earthly but
spiritual, and offer to God spirituall sacrifices: first, we are hence
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> bound by this our calling, to teach and instruct one another:
for the office of the Priest in the old Testament, was to instruct
the people, <hi>The Priests lips must keepe knowledge,</hi> Mal. 2. 7. So
must we be teachers of others, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 18. We all ought to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to teach the will of God, that so the Gospell of Christ may
be spread abroad. And as this belongs to al men, so especially to
gouernors, they must especially shew themselues priests to their
charges. <hi>Abraham</hi> did it, <hi>Gen. 18. Dauid</hi> did it, <hi>Pro.</hi> 4. and <hi>Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shebath</hi>
did it, <hi>Prouer.</hi> 31. and all must do it, that desire an holy
generation to succeed after them. We teach other things, why
not Religion?</p>
            <p>2 Seeing we be priests,<note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> we must pray for others, not onely
for our selues but for all men,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 2. 1.</note> especially the members of Christ,
The Priest in the old Testament must pray and make request,<note place="margin">Ephes. 6. 18.</note>
not onely for himselfe alone, but for the people also. <hi>Moses</hi> is
commended for prayer, especially when he prayed for the Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites,<note place="margin">2. King. 2. 12.</note>
and stood before the Lord in the gap. <hi>Exod. 32. Eliah</hi> is
called the horseman and chariots of Israel:<note place="margin">2. Chro. 30. 18.</note> and <hi>Hezechiah</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seecheth
the Lord to be good to his people. And so when any
man in the word is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended for prayer, it is for that he prayed
for the people. So did <hi>Dauid</hi> in the Psalmes. So did Christ make
this his speciall duty. <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.</p>
            <p>We must offer spirituall sacrifice to God,<note place="margin">Vse 3.</note> that is, dedicate our
selues, our soules and bodies, and all that is in vs, our wit, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
knowledge, or any gift of body or mind, we must conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate
it to Gods seruice. That we may do all this to his glory,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:14859:35"/>
we must look that all we take in hand be begun in faith, do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from a good heart, and be directed to a good end, to Gods
glory principally: and if we do it in faith and obedience, then it
will please him.</p>
            <p>We must be ful of blessings;<note place="margin">Vse 4.</note> we may haue nothing to do with
cursed speaking. As the Priests in the old Testament, their duty
was to blesse the people: so we must speake nothing but blessed
and gracious speeches, take heed of all cursed speaking, of swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and forswearing: we must be blessed and gracious speakers
to all men, friend, fo, or any.</p>
            <p>We must haue God our portion:<note place="margin">Vse 5.</note> for the Leuites had no por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the land of Canaan,<note place="margin">Deut. 10. 19.</note> but dwelt in tents, and the Lord was
their portion.<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 57.</note> So we being Priests to God, we must be content
with any estate in this world, for God is our portion: we must
not seeke too much to haue any inheritance on earth, for Gods
fauour in Christ that is our portion, and this wil suffice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To him be glory.</hi> In these words is a praising and thanksgiuing
to God, for the three former benefits of Christ bestowed on the
Church.</p>
            <p>In that S. <hi>Iohn</hi> before he come to the end of his description
of Christ should interrtupt himselfe,<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> to giue God thankes for his
benefits: we see that the consideration of Gods benefits besto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
on vs, should be a meanes to stirre vs vp to praise the Lord:
we should be caried away with this affection of thanksgiuing,
as S. <hi>Iohn</hi> was.<note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> And in these words of this holy man we do
see what is the true forme of giuing thankes to God, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to giue him and ascribe to him, all glory, power, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
dominion for euermore. But alas it is too too manifest,
that mans corrupt nature will not do this, but denieth it, and
taking this from God, bestoweth it on creatures, yea on our own
selues. And it is a matter of grace, to know this, and to confesse
that all glory and dominion belongs to God, and to giue him
his due. So Christ he teacheth vs to ascribe all power, glory,
might and dominion to God, when we say in the Lords prayer,
<hi>For thine is the kingdome, power and glory:</hi> that is, it is due to thee
O Lord, not to any creature whatsoeuer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Amen.</hi> So be it, let it be so, that thou mayst haue all glory and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:14859:36"/>
dominion, he addes this, to shew his feruent desire of Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie:
and therefore he doubles and repeates it: for he had said
that before, but not content with it, he sheweth his feruencie,
and repeates the same againe so should we not freeze or be cold
in our desire of Gods glorie, but be feruent and earnest, dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
and repeating the same.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Behold he comes in the cloudes, &amp;c.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verse. 7.</note> In the fifth and sixth verses
are contained a large description of Christ, partly by his offices:
partly, by the execution of his offices, which are these. First,
he is a faithfull witnesse. Secondly, he is the first begotten of the
dead. Thirdly, he is Prince of the kings of the earth. Secondly,
the execution of his offices, which stands in fou<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e actions: first,
he loueth the Church: secondly, he washeth away the spots of
it in his bloud: thirdly, made vs kings and priests to God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
and of these three actions in the former verses. The fourth
action, is his second comming to iudgement, to iudge both
quicke and dead. In this seuenth verse is a narration, or large
declaration of the second coming of Christ to iudgement.</p>
            <p>In the words consider first this note of attention: <hi>Behold:</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<hi>S. Iohn</hi> propounds Christ his coming it self: thirdly, the
maner of it, <hi>in the cloudes:</hi> and that is amplified, that it shall be
open, <hi>euery eye shall see it:</hi> fourthly, the effect of his coming, <hi>all
tribes of the earth shall waile.</hi> S. <hi>Iohn</hi> concludes it with two notes
of asseueration: <hi>Euen so, Amen,</hi> to confirme the second coming
of Christ to all people.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Behold.</hi> First, S. <hi>Iohn</hi> he beginneth with a note of attention,
<hi>behold.</hi> The spirit of God is accustomed, when any thing espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
is worth our marking, to prefixe before it this note of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.
Behold; or such like. Then this teacheth vs one speciall
dutie, which is, often and euery day earnestly and seriously to
consider of the second coming of Christ to iudgement. The
which consideration is a speciall meanes to beginne and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
the conuersion of a sinner. So <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 7. when the Scribes
and Pharisees, obstinate enemies, came to the baptisme of S.
<hi>Iohn,</hi> he vseth this as a meanes to make them to turne and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
in Christ, saying; <hi>O generation of vipers, who hath forewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 3 7.</note> 
               <hi>that you should flie from the vengeance to come?</hi> So <hi>Act. 3.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:14859:36"/>
19. Peter</hi> vseth this argument, to bring the Iewes to repentance:
because the day of refreshing is at hand. <hi>Act. 17. 30. 31. Paul</hi>
perswades the Athenians to repentance, because there is a
day of iudgement appointed, &amp;c. Now all these are to winne
men to repentance, by the consideration of this one point, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
the day of iudgement; and this makes <hi>Iohn</hi> to say, <hi>Behold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, this word may serue to strike our hearts with a
feare and reuerence of Christ, when we consider that he shall
come to iudgement. So often as we consider of his coming, so
often we should haue our hearts liuely touched with awe and
reuerence to him. We stand in awe and reuerence to Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,
when we consider that they haue authoritie to attach,
apprehend, and to bring vs to their Courts and assizes: how
much more should this worke an awe and reuerence, when we
consider that Christ Iesus shall come and apprehend, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach
each of vs before his barre of iudgement?</p>
            <p>Secondly, he propounds the coming of Christ himselfe, <hi>He
comes:</hi> that is, Christ shall descend from the highest heauen in
his manhood, to that place where the cloudes be, to the earth
locally. In that he saith not, <hi>shall come,</hi> but in the present time, <hi>he
comes:</hi> first, he sheweth it is a thing not farre off, but present: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
that it is certain, euen as though he now came: thirdly,
he wold haue vs consider of the coming of Christ, not as a thing
to come farre off, but present. This <hi>S. Iohn</hi> learned, and so shold
we by his example learne, that it is present, and perswade our
selues so: and therefore we should often thinke and consider of
the coming of Christ, seeing it is of so great vse. Hence then
our dutie is, to do that euery day, which we would do in the
day of iudgement: seeing it is alwaies present, we must do, think,
and speake that which we would do that day. He which can do
so, he is an happie man.</p>
            <p>Now that a man may come to do this, we must daily consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of that coming of Christ, not as a thing to be delayed or
farre off, but as a thing present: we must euery day call our selues
to a reckoning and accompt, perswade our selues this may be
the last day, and so to carie our selues euery day, as we would in
the last day. Now if we were so perswaded, then we should see
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:14859:37"/>
lesse wickednesses in our life, we would repent, and seeke to be
reconciled to God in Christ, we should be more faithfull, &amp; see
more grace daily in our liues. And the cause of the want of faith
and repentance, and of grace, it is the want of this perswasion,
that we should carie our selues euery day, as we would in the
last day, euen in faith and repentance.</p>
            <p>In that he saith,<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> 
               <hi>He commeth:</hi> Hence we gather, he is absent
in bodily presence in regard of his manhood, he is not here, but
in heauen till the day of iudgement: for if Christ were alwaies
bodily present, he could not be said to come, but onely to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
himselfe, being before present. Then the opinion of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
which hold the bodie of Christ is present in or about the
bread of the Sacrament, is most false and friuolous.</p>
            <p>He proceedeth and setteth out the manner of Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,<note place="margin">The third point the maner.</note>
in two things: first, that he comes in the cloudes: second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that his coming is open and visible to euery eye.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>With cloudes.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 18. &amp; 97.</note> Here <hi>S. Iohn</hi> speaketh after the maner of the
auncient Prophets, who to set out God in his maiestie and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
say, he comes with cloudes, rides on the wings of the wind:
as though he had said, he comes in exceeding maiestie and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.
These words are added, to make a distinction betweene the
first and second coming of Christ. His first coming was in
humilitie, borne of a poore virgin, entertained in a stable and in
an Inne: but his second comming is with glorie, maiestie and
dominion in the cloudes. And the reason is, because he came
first to be a redemption, and a Sauiour, and therfore in the state
of a seruant: but his second coming is, to be a iudge of all men,
yea of his enemies, and therefore in this coming, he cometh
with all might, maiestie, and glorie.</p>
            <p>The vse of this consideration is set downe in the 97. Psalme:<note place="margin">Vse.</note>
to make the very mountaines to tremble, to confound the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
and vngodly, and to comfort the godly in that day.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is not secret, but in open appearance, <hi>euery eye
shall see him:</hi> he shall come in maiestie and glorie, not secretly,
but in visible shew to all the world: all men shall see him with
their owne eyes, all I say which were since the world began to
his coming.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:14859:37"/>
In these words he sets downe three points: first, that all men
shal see him: secondly, that all men being raised againe, shal haue
life and motion, and their senses restored to them as before they
died: thirdly, that all men, none excepted, shall come and stand
before the tribunall seate of Christ.</p>
            <p>This is a comfort to Gods children,<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> in that they being dead &amp;
rotten in their graues, shall rise, and receiue their life and motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
and see Christ their Sauiour and Iudge of all men. If a man
should lie downe to sleepe, and be told that when he rose he
should see his dead father and mother, or his dearest friends:
this would be a notable comfort to him, that so he should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy
them againe: but this should be a farre greater comfort
to vs, that we which lie dead and rotten in the graue, shall be
raised, and enioy not our parents and friends, but Christ Iesus
the sonne of God, which is our frind aboue all friends, who shall
giue vs not onely life and motion, but eternall life with his owne
maiestie.<note place="margin">Job 19.</note> This was <hi>Iobs</hi> comfort, that though he died, yet he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued
he should see his redeemer with his eyes: and this should
be our comfort against the feare of death and the last iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>It shall be a terror to the wicked,<note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> &amp; to all impenitent sinners,
who shall (wil they nil they) be brought to the barre of Christs
iudgement seate, and then looke on him who is their Iudge,
whom they had in their life contemned. And this consideration
may serue to moue vs to repentance, which haue not begun to
repent, and to labor to becom the members of Christ. We think
when we die all is done, there is no harme to follow: but though
we lie rotting in our graues a thousand or two thousand yeares,
yet we shall rise: and if we repented not, we shall heare the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of condemnation, and looke vpon our Iudge with our
owne eyes. Then it is best for vs now in the time of grace while
we liue here, to prepare, that we need not feare to come to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
and behold this Iudge. No doubt if we were perswaded
that we should thus appeare, it would moue vs to repent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Euery eye shall see him.</hi> Then here we see, that all men with
their owne eyes shall looke on him, and those who wanted them
in this life, shall haue them restored. It is graunted of all Diuines
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:14859:38"/>
that the elect haue all their senses and other defects restored: and
it is to be added, that the wicked too they shal haue all their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers,
senses and faculties of soule and body restored, the deafe
shall heare, the blind shall see this Iudge: but this can be no glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to them, seeing it is to increase their punishment: for the more
senses they haue, they haue the more punishment, because we
iudge of things by sense.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Euen of those which pierced him.</hi> This is added, first to shew
that we shal be freed. No power or wisedom of any man or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch
can free vs from appearing: for if any could escape, then
the Iewes and Gentiles who preuailed most against Christ, in
that they put him to death: but none of these can escape his
iudgement, for euen they which pierced him, they shall see this
Iudge, &amp; be summoned before his maiestie: for though they had
power to kill him, yet none of them shall haue power to absent
themselues from before his barre.</p>
            <p>2 To shew the case of all wicked men, namely, that such
wo and misery befals them as they neuer dreamed of. The Iewes
and Gentiles they crucified Christ, and put him to a temporall
death, but they neuer dreamed he should condemne them to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
death.</p>
            <p>3 To shew the rufull and wofull estate of all impenitent sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:
for these men shall haue their greatest enemy to be their
iudge, who will shew rigour vpon them, and iustice without all
mercy: and this is meant not only of the Iew which pierced him,
but of all impenitent sinners, because all such do by their sins,
as swords and speares wound him at the heart,<note place="margin">Zach. 12. 10.</note> as the souldiers
did. These be as bad as the Iewes which pierced Christ: as <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>
which betrayed Christ, &amp; as the souldiers which goared his
sides.</p>
            <p>Out of these words some gather, that the body of Christ hath
still the wounds and scarres which here he had giuen him, the
print of the nailes in his hands and in his feete, and that these
shall be seene in Christ at the last day, and say, that it is no infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie
to Christ to haue these, but rather an increase of his glory:
but this cannot be gathered hence: for though it be said, They
shall see him whom they pierced, yet not as he was pierced.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:14859:38"/>
And because they shall see him, shall they see his wounds? Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
shall see Kings and Queenes whom they crowned in this
world, <hi>ergo</hi> as Kings and Queenes? So we shall see our fathers &amp;
mothers, therefore as fathers and mothers? so many shall see
Christ therefore as he was wounded and pierced? It is no good
collection nor opinion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And all the tribes of the earth shall waile for him.</hi> That is, before
or ouer him. Here is the fruit and effect of his comming, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in the wicked.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All the tribes of the earth.</hi> S. <hi>Iohn</hi> he speakes here of the world,
as it was in the condition and diuision of the land of Canaan:
for before that time it was not diuided into tribes. So Math. 25.
setteth out the iudgement of the whole world, by the separation
of the sheep from the goates: noting that they which repented
not, of what tribe soeuer, of what estate or condition, shall waile
and mourne.</p>
            <p>And he addes a reason of this, <hi>for him, before him,</hi> or <hi>ouer him:</hi>
that is, they shal waile and lament with exceeding lamentation,
because they beleeued not his word, but contemned his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and therefore now they want all helpe to free them
from the punishment of their vnbeleefe, and contempt of the
Gospell.</p>
            <p>If they shall mourne because they did not beleeue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
the doctrine of Christ,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> and for that haue no way to escape,
then it is our dutie to labour aboue all things to be reconciled
to God in Christ, to get our sinnes pardoned, to beleeue and
embrace the word of God: for vnlesse we beleeue, and be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
when the last day comes, there is no hope of helpe, no way
to escape, no time of grace to repent. If the doore be once shut,
we must stand without, there is nothing then but horror of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
for vs: it will be a day to vs to make our eyes start out of
our heads, a day of all woe and misery. Then it is great wisdome
so to spend the time of grace, in this life especially, that we may
get the pardon of our sins, reconciliation with God in Christ, to
receiue and beleeue his will and word: which if we do, we shall
haue no cause at all to waile and mourne, but be glad, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce.
Then we must take heed the Diuell steale not out of our
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:14859:39"/>
hearts this one lesson, which is most necessary, which he wil most
labour for to do.</p>
            <p>See what an euill conscience is: it lieth asleepe here, while a
man liues it neuer troubleth him, but in this last day when he
shall see his Iudge with his eyes, then it wil stirre, it wil torment
him, it will attach, accuse and condemne him, it will lay to his
charge his sinnes, his contempt of Christ and his word, his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleefe
in the time of grace, it will be as a thousand witnesses
to condemne him. This should cause all men to labour to get a
good conscience, washed and purged in the blood of Christ,
which will not lay to our charge any one sinne, but assure vs we
be in the fauour of God, which wil not make vs feare, but looke
vp to our redeemer, and to reioyce in him. We must take heed
when our conscience lieth asleepe and accuseth not, no not at
death, for it will then deceiue vs: but search and examine our
hearts and consciences, and seeke to haue them washed and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
in the blood of Christ.</p>
            <p>Lastly he confirmeth this doctrine of the second comming of
Christ, by a double note of asseueratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>Eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so, Amen.</hi> One of these
is taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Ebrewes <hi>Amen:</hi> the second from the Grecians <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
Euen as we auouch a thing, first by a simple and bare affirmation
or negation: secondly, by an earnest asseueration: thirdly, by an
oath. Now in that S. <hi>Iohn</hi> vseth these two kinds of assuring in this
weightie matter of Christs second coming, we see our dutie: we
must not vse the like at any time or thing, but onely in matters of
weight and moment: so S. <hi>Iohn</hi> here, <hi>he shall come,</hi> and that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
vndoubtedly it shalbe so. Then the practise of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
which vse these words in matters of no weight, at euery
word, and much more which bind euery word with an oath
which is far more. Yea though our Sauior ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vseth these words
of asseueration, yet onely in matters of weight and moment, and
when the hearers were to be certified of the truth of a thing
which was of importance.</p>
            <p>2 He would by this shew, that the coming of Christ is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
and most vndoubted: and to make vs out of all doubt, he
addeth these two words of asseueratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>Eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so, Ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:</hi> most certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it will come, then we should often thinke of this matter, for in
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:14859:39"/>
our nature there is a corruption, which perswadeth vs that the
coming of Christ is not yet: that we shall not be summoned ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by generall or particular iudgement: therefore as the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
seruant, we deferre the comming of Christ. To take away
this corruption, he saith, he cometh, yea certainely, vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he cometh, and that out of hand.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, to shew a speciall note and marke of Gods child:
for he doth not onely asseuere, but withall desireth and longeth
for the coming of Christ: Lord let it be so, <hi>Amen,</hi> let it euen
be so. They long for and desire Christ his coming to iudgment:
but the wicked could wish with all their hearts, that it might
neuer be.<note place="margin">2. Tim. 4. 8.</note> The godly they know, that when Christ shall come,
then they shall haue that crowne of immortalitie and glorie,
which he hath prepared for all which desire his coming. But
the wicked, and they which are not reconciled to God in Christ
nor assured of their owne saluation, they cannot for their life
once wish and desire the coming of Christ. So that by this
one note we may iudge of our owne estates, whether we belong
to Christ or not: for if we desire and long for his second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to iudgement,<note place="margin">Reuel. 22. 20.</note> if we wish he would come quickly, then it
is a certain token and signe, we be reconciled to God in Christ,
that we belong to him. But if as yet we feele not this longing
and hungring desire in vs, then we must suspect our selues, and
labour to feele it euery day:<note place="margin">Reu. 6. 10.</note> for it is the desire of the Saints, and
of all the true children of God.</p>
            <p>After that <hi>S. Iohn</hi> had described Christ at large here in this
eighth verse,<note place="margin">Vers. 8.</note> he bringeth him in speaking of himselfe by a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure.
<hi>I am Alpha and Omega,</hi> saith the Lord.</p>
            <p>The end and scope of this eighth verse is, to confirme the
former description of Christ. The reason is thus framed: He
which is the beginning and the end of all, he is sufficient to be a
King, Priest, and Prophet, and is both able and willing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
all blessings on his Church. This first part of the argument
is omitted: the second part is contained in this eighth verse: But
I am the beginning and the end, &amp;c. I am sufficient, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In this eighth verse are three points concerning Christ:<note place="margin">Three points.</note> first,
he is the beginning and the end: I am alpha and omega: second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:14859:40"/>
he is, was, and is to come: thirdly, he is almightie, omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</p>
            <p>1 The first point is,<note place="margin">1. Point.</note> that Christ is the beginning and the end,
which he expresseth by a comparison taken from the Greeke
alphabet, or the <hi>A. B. C.</hi> of the Grecians: for as in their Greeke
alphabet, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is the first letter, and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the last: so I, saith Christ, am
the beginning of all things, and the end of all: as those letters
in the Greeke alphabet, so am I in all things the first and last.</p>
            <p>Out of this, that Christ borroweth this comparison from the
Greeke alphabet, the Papists gather, that the word may be
read and deliuered to the people in an vnknowne toung, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Christ here vseth an vnknowne toung, to those whom he
gaue this vision. But though the vnlearned, and vnlettered En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
man, knoweth not what <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is: yet the Church to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
this booke was written, being the Grecians, knew what they
meant generally. Againe, though the spirit of God vseth a
strange word in one place, we may not follow that in the whole
word of God, in the whole seruice and worship of God, as the
Papists do.</p>
            <p>Christ is said to be the beginning and the end: first, because
he is the very first of all things: there was nothing before he
was, he had a being, when all other creatures were not but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne
to be, then was he the same that he is now: he had his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and subsisting before all creatures: and for this saith <hi>S. Iohn,</hi>
chap. 1. verse 1. <hi>In the beginning was the word:</hi> that is, the Son
of God, he had his being and subsisting when all other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
wanted it, and began to be.</p>
            <p>This proueth the eternitie of Christ, because he had his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
before any creature was created, he was a substance and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
begotten of the Father before all worlds, not created as
other creatures are, or made of any other.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he is called the beginning, because he giueth a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
to all creatures: for all things which were created, were
created by him, and had their being from him. So that he is the
true beginning of all things. <hi>Coloss. 1. 16. All things are from
him,</hi> he is the beginning of all: and all are for him, he is the end
of all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:14859:40"/>
Seeing Christ giues a being to all things,<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> then we when we
are to beginne any businesse in word or deed, we must begin it
with inuocation on the name of Christ: for Christ he giues the
beginning and proceeding to all things. Then we which haue
our beginnings of him, must not dare to begin anything with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
inuocation on his name.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the same Christ he is the end of all things for two
causes: first, because he is the last of all things, and after him is
nothing in subsisting and being: nay if all creatures were left to
themselues, they would all come to nothing: and yet though
all should come to nothing, Christ would remaine the same he
was for euer: namely, the eternall Sonne and word of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
In that some creatures are become eternall, this is not of
themselues, but by Christ, he giues them eternall being and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and if they were left to themselues, they would come to
nothing as well as others.</p>
            <p>This then shold make vs with full purpose of heart to cleaue
to Christ,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> if we would enioy eternall happinesse: for without
him, and vnlesse we haue it from him, we cannot but come to
an end.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he is the end, because all things were made to
serue him. <hi>Coloss. 1. 16. For him were all things created.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Which is,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Point.</note> 
               <hi>was, and is to come.</hi> These words were expounded
in the fourth verse, where the very same are affirmed of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
The sense is, that Christ is a substance and essence, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
subsisting in, by, and from himselfe, and such a substance
shall be for euer.</p>
            <p>Hence we learne two things:<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> first, that the second person in
the Trinitie is consubstantiall with the Father, of one and the
same substance and nature with him. And the reason is, because
there can be but one onely substance, essence, and being, which
can be in and by it selfe, and from it selfe alone: there cannot be
two or moe, but onely one. As there cannot be two eternals, or
two infinits, two omnipotents and absolute Lords which haue
nothing one of another. Now in the fourth verse it is said of the
Father, that he is a substance of, in, by, and from himselfe alone:
and here of the Sonne is rehearsed the same. Then they, seeing
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:14859:41"/>
there can be but one such essence, must needs be all one: and
the Sonne must needes be the same substance, nature, and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
with the Father: not like him, or diuerse from him, but
the selfe same in substance and nature: that is, their Godhead
is consubstantiall, &amp;c. They be indeed two distinct persons, yet
but one substance and diuine essence in the Godhead, which
<hi>S. Iohn</hi> intimates, affirming the same words of both.</p>
            <p>Hence we learne,<note place="margin">Christ is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> that Christ is God of himselfe: for in the
same respect the Father is God, he is God: and as the Father is,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> was, and is to come: so in the same regard is Christ, &amp;c. But the
Father is God of himselfe, ergo, also Christ is God of himselfe.
Indeed as he is the Sonne, so he is of the Father, hath this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
from him: but as he is God, he is consubstantiall with
the Father, and coequall with him, hath his essence of and in
himselfe. And the same is to be affirmed of the holy Ghost, as
he is the third person: he proceedes from the Father and the
Sonne, but as he is God, he is of, from and in himselfe.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3 That Christ is coeternall with the Father, and as euerlasting
as he is, euery way coequall to the Father, hauing the same at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
equally with him, as he is God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Almightie.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The third point</note> As there is in God, so is there in Christ a
double power: first, a potentiall: secondly an actuall power. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiall
is that whereby he can do many things moe then he wil
do; as he could raise children to <hi>Abraham</hi> of the stones, but he
would not: he could haue deliuered Christ from death, but he
would not. It is not taken for this power here principally, but
rather for the second, namely, his actuall power, whereby he
bringeth to passe without let and impediment, whatsoeuer he
decreeth, willeth, or promiseth. So he is called Almightie here,
because he bringeth to passe actually, whatsoeuer he promiseth
to his in his word, without let and stop.</p>
            <p>Seeing he is thus Almightie,<note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note> hence come two comforts to
his children: first, that whatsoeuer he hath promised his church
in Christ, shall be brought to passe effectually, without stop and
let, as assuredly as he promised it. Now since he promiseth in
the Gospell to all penitent sinners remission of sinnes, mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
iustification, and life euerlasting; euery one of them in
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:14859:41"/>
their time shall be done. Euery true beleeuer shall haue pardon
of his sinnes, mortification, sanctification, and eternall life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he which promised is almightie, able and willing to do all
he promised.</p>
            <p>This is a comfort to all true beleeuers: for all men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
cannot giue one of these: but Christ he is omnipotent, he
can and will giue them all.</p>
            <p>2 He will and can giue his Church sufficient securitie and ease
from all her enemies: he can defend and guard her against all
their furie and malice; he is aboue them, and can bridle their
might, when and how he pleaseth.</p>
            <p>This then affoords vs two duties. First, in the crosse and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation
to humble our selues vnder the hand of God. For it is
the Lord which correcteth vs, he is able to do what he list, and
more then he will.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this should make vs to performe heartie obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in our generall and particular callings, to walke vprightly
before him, seeing he is almightie, and seeth whether we walke
sincerely or not: if we do not, he is able to punish vs. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. it
is the argument of God to perswade <hi>Abraham</hi> to walke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly,
because he is almightie, able to correct and destroy
those which refuse to obey him.</p>
            <p>Thus farre of the two first parts of this Chapter, the Inscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the Titles of this booke.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I Iohn,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verse 9. The third part of this chapter.</note> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here followeth the third part of this Chapter,
which containeth a vision, from this ninth verse to the end of
the third Chapter.</p>
            <p>In this vision, two things are to be noted: first, the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances:
secondly, the parts. The circumstances in the ninth and
tenth verses: the parts from thence, to the end of the third
Chapter.</p>
            <p>The circumstances of this vision are 4. the first, touching the
person to whom this vision befell, <hi>Iohn:</hi> the second, the place
where, <hi>in Pathmos:</hi> the third, the maner how it is propounded:
it was deliuered to him, being <hi>rauished in the spirit:</hi> the fourth,
the time when, <hi>on the Lords day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first circumstance is the person to whom this vision be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell,<note place="margin">1. Circumstance</note>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:14859:42"/>
               <hi>Iohn.</hi> He doth this to shew, that it was giuen him of the
Lord: for as the Lord hath his visions and reuelations, so the
Diuell hath his: but they be distinguished by the persons to
whom they be giuen. God giueth his visions not to all men, but
to those which are most fit for them, such as be most holy men
for life, indued with exceeding gifts of God, as knowledge, wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
constancie, zeale, pietie, and religion. So in the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament
he deliuered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to his Prophets, not to all, but his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants,
men of singular gifts and graces, and of exceeding holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and pietie. Indeed the Lord reuealed some particular
things to wicked men, as to <hi>Balaam,</hi> but they neuer knew them
comfortably. It is a propertie belonging to the seruants of God
to haue a vision reuealed, and to know the same.</p>
            <p>Now both these befell <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> he was a man of exceeding
holinesse of life, (for Christ loued him) and of singular and rare
gifts. Now the diuell maketh no such choice, but his visions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
men which are heretikes, wicked, notorious sinners, and
they haue no rare and speciall gifts as the other: so that by this a
man may distinguish them, by the persons to whom they befall.
Then we must esteeme of it as a singular gift of God giuen to
his owne Apostle <hi>S. Iohn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the description of Christ,<note place="margin">Verse 9.</note> 
               <hi>Iohn</hi> describes himselfe by
many modest tearmes:<note place="margin">1. Title.</note> first, <hi>Your brother,</hi> that is, of them being
members all of the mysticall bodie Christ Iesus: for the church
of God is a familie, God the Father is head and housholder, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ is the elder brother, we all are fellow brethren in and
by Christ, being by him the adopted sonnes of God, and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
to each other.</p>
            <p>By this title first he setteth out his humilitie and great mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie:<note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note>
for he was a man at that time aboue all men which liued, in
regard of his gifts and holinesse of life: he was the last Apostle,
and had apostolicall authoritie, being a most true professor, yet
he calleth himselfe a <hi>brother</hi> to all true beleeuers, maketh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
but equall with them, though they were farre inferiour to
him. And so should we esteeme better of all our brethren,
then of our selues, and make our selues inferior to them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, by this title we see he had his hart full of brotherly
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:14859:42"/>
loue to all the members of the church of Christ: so we are bound
to loue all men, as they be of the same flesh with vs; but those
which be of the same faith &amp; religion, to these especially should
we shew our loue and affection. It is good reason, that they
which haue the same head Christ, the same God, the same faith,
hope,<note place="margin">Rom. 12.</note> religion, and redemption by Iesus Christ, should be so
affected to one another: and being linked by all these, should
haue a more neare loue, then is between man &amp; man. But in this
world,<note place="margin">Isay. 66. 5.</note> as <hi>Esay</hi> saith, men hate their brethren, euen for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of the same religion, whereby they thinke to be saued. If
they liue with more conscience then others, then they reuile,
speake ill of, and hate them for the name of Christ.</p>
            <p>The second title: <hi>Companion</hi> or fellow partner, compartner in
<hi>tribulations, in the kingdome and in patience.</hi> He was partner with
them in tribulations for two causes: first, because at that time
when he wrote this vision, the whole Church was in persecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
and tribulation, vnder that cruell tyrant <hi>Domitian,</hi> about foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score
or an hundred yeares after Christ: and so he fled to Path<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos
at that time, and being mindfull of the afflictions of the
Church, whereof he was a member, he cals himselfe a partner
with them in affliction.</p>
            <p>By which he shewes our estate, that it is to be vnder the crosse,
to liue in affliction; not to be companions of peace and ease, but
partakers of affliction and tribulation: and therfore those which
will be Christs Disciples and follow him, they must deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
and take vp their crosse dayly; and because of this estate
the Church in this world is called the <hi>militant Church.</hi> Now
seeing the state of the Church is in tribulation:<note place="margin">Vse.</note> we in this land
and Church, which haue had peace and quietnes so long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
persecution, we must know that it is giuen vs, that now in
the time of peace we might prepare our selues against the day
of triall and persecution: for seeing the estate of the Church is to
be vnder affliction and persecution, we are bound to looke for
it, and know that the Lord will come and try his Church: for it
must increase and grow by triall. The Lord hath sent labourers
into his haruest a long time, which haue gathered much wheate
into the Lords barne. Now there must come a day when the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:14859:43"/>
Lord will take his fan and siue into his hands, and will with the
fan and siue of persecution try the wheat and winnow the corne
from the chaffe, that it may appeare who are his true children.
Then stands it vs in hand, to take heed we be found good corne
and not chaffe, that we may abide the siue, that we proue not
light corne, blowne about with the wind, and fit to be cast into
the fire to be burnt.</p>
            <p>He cals himselfe their fellow partner in affliction, because his
pitifull hart was moued with compassion to all his fellow mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
and partners in affliction, when he remembred their perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
and affliction they suffered vnder the cruell tyrant
<hi>Dominitian.</hi> Now looke what was in him, the same affection
should be in vs, our hearts should be pitifull, full of compassion
for the poore afflicted members of Christ: seeing they be our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
members, we should haue a fellow feeling with them, and
shew our compassion in pittying them. If the foote be pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
the head stoopes, the eye beholds and lookes on it, the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
puls it out, the hand applies the plaister, the other foot is
ready to run for help, the tongue to aske for counsell, and all the
members are ready to affoord their mutuall helpe in pittie and
fellow feeling: so when any members of the Church suffer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
be pricked with persecution for Christs cause, then
should we, as fellow members of one body, be ready to do all
the helpe we can to them, especially in shewing our fellow-fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
with them.</p>

               <hi>In the kingdome of Christ.</hi> That is, the kingdome of heauen.
In that he sets first afliction, then addes a kingdome, he shewes
that the afflictions &amp; crosse for Christs sake, is the ready way to
the kingdom of heauen: it is the way which is beaten and troden
by the Prophets, Apostles and the Saints of God: as the Apostle
saith,<note place="margin">Act 14. 21.</note> 
               <hi>Through manifold tribulations we must enter into heauen.</hi>
And this momentany affliction causeth to vs an infinite weight

to heauen.</p>
            <p>Then we must not thinke it strange when it befalleth vs,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> for it
is the meanes to bring wandring sheepe out of the way, into the
ready and beaten way to heauen; nay it is rather to be thought
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:14859:43"/>
strange when we haue no affliction:<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 8.</note> for then we be gone out of
the way, seeing the Lord afflicts euery child which is his.</p>

               <hi>In patience.</hi> A vertue whereby we are made able to perseuere
in affliction, to go on suffering till we come to heauen. Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are the beaten way, heauen is our ioyfull end, patience is the
meanes to make vs perseuere and go on till we come to our
iourneys end. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 4. Hope to come to heauen is obtained
by patience, which maketh a beleeuer to go on suffering till he
come to life eternall. There is much fruite in the good ground,
but not obtained without patience: and the true beleeuer liues
by hope in this life, yet cannot come to heauen without pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.
<hi>Iames</hi> 5. 9.</p>
            <p>Now because men will say, Patience is a hard matter, and so
are discouraged; therfore to set an edge on their desire, he addes
it is the kingdome and patience of Christ: first, because he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunds
it: secondly, patience cometh from the spirit of Christ:
thirdly, because as he suffereth in his members, it is called his
patience, for their misery and suffering is his: when his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
suffer, he suffereth. And this is a singular comfort to al suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the crosse, that they haue Christ their fellow sufferer, he
takes part with them, puts vnder his shoulder, he is content to
suffer with them. And in these three standeth the communion of
Saints in suffering tribulation. The first step to this fellowship &amp;
communion of Saints, is to beare and be in tribulation, and he
which is not come to that, is not yet in the communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Saints.
Then secondly, he must patiently beare them, perseuere without
grudging or repining: then followes the last, which is the end of
all, the enioying of the kingdome of heauen.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Which was in the Ile called Pathmos.</hi> In these words is the
second circumstance, namely, the place where this vision was
giuen to <hi>Iohn,</hi> namely, in the Ile Pathmos: <hi>an Iland,</hi> and one of
those which the Geographers call <hi>Sporades,</hi> lying on the left
side of the Churches of Asia, neare to the East Churches by the
sea, commonly called the Egean sea: this Iland was a small, base,
and poore Iland, litle or neuer a whit inhabited.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>S. Iohn</hi> had his vision, not at Ierusalem, at Antioch, or Rome,
but in Pathmos, a base, poore, and litle inhabited Iland. By
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:14859:44"/>
which we see, that in the new Testament there is no respect of
one place aboue another, in regard of Gods presence and our
fellowship with him: he doth as well giue <hi>Iohn</hi> this vision in
Pathmos, as to others his Prophets and Apostles in Ierusalem.
In the old Testament there was regard of places: as the Lord
shewed his presence, and tyed his worship especially to his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle
and temple at Ierusalem; there was the place where he
would be worshipped,<note place="margin">Dan. 6.</note> which <hi>Daniel</hi> in his prophecy sheweth:
for being in captiuitie, he in his chamber openeth the window
which was towards the temple at Ierusalem. But now in the new
Testament that regard of place is abolished. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 8. Pray e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
where, lifting vp pure hands in regard of Gods worship
and presence; in all the duties of Religion we must do the
like.</p>
            <p>Then away with Popish pilgrimage,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> to churches and chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels
of Saints, or to their reliques, for this is meere superstition:
for God is present euery where, and a man may haue fellowship
with him in one place as wel as another. Also, this may serue to
correct our false conceit we haue of our churches and chappels;
for we come into our common houses wherein we dwell, and
neuer humble our selues, we thinke in these places we need not:
but if we come into the Church neuer so often, we then fall
downe and humble our hearts in prayer: the reason is, because
we thinke that God is more present there, and we should soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
be heard there then in our houses, and that they be more
holy. But in the new Testament now, all such diuersitie of place
is abolished, in regard of Gods seruice and presence. Indeed
Churches must be maintained, because in them the people may
more conueniently meete together to serue God: but we must
not think but that common houses are as holy as they for Gods
seruice: onely for decency sake, when we that are many may as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
together in one place, they be more holy then any
dwelling house, for that time when the word is preached, and
prayer made in them.</p>
            <p>In this circumstance of place note two things, first, by what
meanes <hi>S. Iohn</hi> came thither: secondly, to what end, and for
what cause. First, he came thither by banishment: the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:14859:44"/>
               <hi>Domitian</hi> exiled him: secondly, he came for the word of
God.</p>
            <p>He came and abode in Pathmos, being banished for the
Gospels sake. In this banishment consider first that <hi>S. Iohn</hi> was a
most worthy Apostle, endued with rare gifts, a singular main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainer
of the Gospell, and a famous founder of the Church of
God, and chiefe guide thereof in those dayes, and for this cause
most hated of the cruel persecutor <hi>Domitian,</hi> &amp; of the Romanes:
yet whereas many other of the true Christians were put to the
sword, S. <hi>Iohn</hi> is not, he escapeth and was banished. The cause
of this was Gods speciall prouidence, by which he had reserued
him for the benefit of the Church, that he might receiue this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation,
and commit it to the Church to the perpetuall good of
all his children. And so though <hi>Domitian</hi> was a cruell tyrant, yet
he could not kill him, but God ouer-ruled him, that he did but
banish him into this Iland, wherein he receiued these visions,
and penned them for the good of the Church.</p>
            <p>By this we see the great care and prouidence of God that he
hath ouer his Church,<note place="margin">Doctr. 1.</note> that he doth bridle and ouer-rule the
minds and might of cruell Emperours, that they cannot but do
al that they do to the glory of God, though they intend the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
For <hi>Domitian</hi> intended only the hurt of <hi>Iohn,</hi> yet see, by his
banishment into that Ile, he had fit place to receiue these visions
for the good of the Church. So in the death of Christ, the Iewes
and Gentiles, and all men banded themselues together to put
Christ to death, and the diuell he laboured to stirre them on to
practise their intended malice: yet the prouidence of God dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth
and ordereth this their malice and wicked practise to the
redemption of mankind. So <hi>Iosephs</hi> brethren intended no such
deliuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce as God wrought by him, in selling their brother. This
consideration should comfort all Gods children, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>When we are oppressed and persecuted by tyrants for Christs
sake,<note place="margin">Doctr. 2.</note> we must make no resistance, offer no violence, but suffer all
things without resisting, for the Christians weapons are onely
prayers and teares:<note place="margin">Arma Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianorum, preces &amp; la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chrimae.</note> and S. <hi>Iohn</hi> often in this booke addeth after
the foretelling of persecution, <hi>Here is the patience of Saints,</hi> shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that must be the complet armour against all out enemies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:14859:45"/>
Seeing he came into this Island not of his owne accord,<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> but
by violence and constraint, he thought it not a good and happy
kind of life. For if he had come into this place, being litle or not
inhabited, he could not do this dutie of his Apostleship: he
could not haue founded the Church. This then confuteth the
Monkish life, which is no life of holy perfection, (as they call
it) but of great superstition. <hi>S. Iohn</hi> would not haue left all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie
of men, but that he was compelled to leaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: then the
life of those which voluntarily leaue all companie of men, liuing
in cloisters and secret places, cannot be a life of perfection, but
of all imperfection: man is borne to do good to others.</p>
            <p>Seeing <hi>S. Iohn</hi> was banished,<note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> and here receiued his visions,
we see that those which honour God, he will honour them. For
S. <hi>Iohn</hi> was banished, then which what could they do more to
hurt him? Yet then, because it was for Gods cause, God doth
most honour him, in reuealing to him these visions. So when
<hi>Ioseph</hi> was sold of his brethren, and most dishonoured of them,
then God exalted him. The same may be said of <hi>Daniel,</hi> who
when he was most dishonoured of men, then the Lord exalted
him aboue all other men: and the same is true of all Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 2.</note>
they which honor him, he will honour them.</p>
            <p>2 The cause for which he came into this Isle: <hi>For the word
of God:</hi> that is, because he was by calling a publisher and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
of the word of God, for which cause he was banished. By
which we may note, that all naturall men (as <hi>Domitian</hi> and
the Romaines were, and all men are by nature) hate all that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
God, hate his word, they cannot abide it. For <hi>S. Iohn</hi> a most
worthie Apostle, a famous man for gifts, a singular preacher of
the word of God: yet for this very cause is hunted, nay banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
not for his owne cause, but for the word of God. This hath
bene seene in all heathen Emperours, yea and all men by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hate the word: yet though they hate it in their hearts, the
same word it winneth them, and hath taken place in them to
conuert them, and to make them to loue it: which sheweth, that
the word taught by the Prophets and Apostles, is indeed the
true word of God, not the inuention of man. For if the word
which is hated of all men by nature, had not some diuine po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:14859:45"/>
in it, it could neuer make such me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to loue it by grace, which
hate it by nature. For no word of man can make a man which
hateth the same to loue it, but onely the word of God.</p>
            <p>Seeing <hi>Iohn</hi> was banished for Gods word,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> all Ministers are
to cast their accompts, to make a reckoning that they may and
must suffer persecution, nay, banishment for the word of God.
For that which the principall founders and chiefe builders of
the Church haue suffered, that cannot be auoyded of them
which are ordinarie Ministers. Christ he acquainted his disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
with this, and telleth them, that they are euen accursed,
when all men speake well of them. <hi>Luk.</hi> 6. 26. They must not
seeke to haue all thinke well of them, but rather feare if all men
like of them, they are accursed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And witnesse bearing.</hi> That is, for the testimonie of the history
and doctrine of the Gospell: the summe whereof is, that Iesus
Christ the sonne of <hi>Mary</hi> is our Redeemer, to procure to vs
righteousnesse and life euerlasting. Now he addeth after the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
this of the Gospell, as a doctrine how to come to life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting
and righteousnesse in Iesus Christ: to shew, for what
part of the word we are most hated and persecuted, not so much
for the law as for the Gospell: because the law is partly natural,
the Gospell is aboue nature: as, to beleeue that God made his
couenant with our first parents,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> that the seed of the woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shold
bruise the serpents head. Now the Gospell is the glad tidings, in
which there is declared, that the promised seed is come, and
therefore the diuell he hateth this part most of all, and laboureth
man to hinder the course of the Gospell, rather then of the law.
So three hundred yeares after Christ, he laboured by might and
maine to extinguish the Gospell, to keepe men in ignorance of
the Messiah: but when he could not preuaile by force &amp; might,
he vsed sophistrie and deceipt, and brought in heresies to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
the truth of the Gospell, and to ouerthrow the natures, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
and benefites of Christ.</p>
            <p>Then we are bound to do the contrarie:<note place="margin">Vse.</note> seeing he laboureth
to extinguish it, we must labour to maintaine and defend it, we
must labour as much to know it, as he doth to keepe vs in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
that so we may obey and beleeue it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:14859:46"/>
               <hi>And I was rauished on the Lords day,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vers. 10.</note> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In this tenth verse are
two circumstances: the first, which is the third in number, is the
maner of receiuing this vision, and giuing of it to <hi>Iohn,</hi> namely,
in a traunce: the second or fourth, the time, <hi>on that Lords day,</hi> or
<hi>that day of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I was in the spirit.</hi> Here we see he receiued this vision in a
trance. <hi>I was in the spirit:</hi> that is, I was by the mightie and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie
worke of the spirit of God cast into a traunce. This
appeareth by comparing this Prophecie with other, as with
that of <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> who when he receiued any vision, was cast
into a traunce by Gods spirit.</p>
            <p>To vnderstand this, consider two things: first, what a
trance is: secondly, the end of it. A trance is an extraordinarie
worke or action of Gods spirit, ergo, not of the constellation
and temperature of the starres, nor from the constitution of
mans bodie, or imaginations of men, but wrought by the holy
Ghost. Secondly, it is not euery worke, but an extraordinarie
work, aboue the order of nature, a powerfull and mightie work
of the holy Ghost: wherein the whole man both in bodie and
mind is altered, and for that cause <hi>S. Iohn</hi> saith: <hi>I was in the spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This action consisteth in two actions: one of the mind, and
the other of the bodie. In procuring a trance, the spirit of God
casteth a man into a dead sleepe, whereby all the senses both
inward and outward are benummed. So <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 12. when God
renewed the couenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> he cast him into a trance,
that is, into a dead sleepe: the senses all were benummed, onely
the mind and soule working.</p>
            <p>The other action of the holy Ghost is on the mind, to draw
it from fellowship with the bodie and all the senses, to haue fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship
with God, that so the spirit of God may enlighten it
with light and knowledge of things which are to reuealed to it.
And so we see in other extasies and traunces:<note place="margin">Act. 10.</note> as that of <hi>Peter,</hi> his
mind was drawne from the fellowship with the bodie, and was
in fellowship with God.</p>
            <p>Then a trance is a mightie and powerfull worke of the holy
Ghost,<note place="margin">VVhat a trance is.</note> both in bodie and mind: whereby both the mind is
drawne from fellowship with the bodie, and vnto the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:14859:46"/>
of God; and also enlightened with light and knowledge of
God, to vnderstand things to be reuealed. Now followeth the
end of a trance.</p>
            <p>The cause why men are cast into trances in receiuing any visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
is, that (as <hi>S. Iohn</hi> here) they might know, that the things
deliuered were not inuented of themselues, but giuen of God.
For in <hi>Iohn,</hi> his bodie and all his senses were benummed; he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
heard, saw, nor felt, but they were asleepe, and therefore
the vision must needes be from God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that they might take the deeper impression in his
and their mind: for when the mind is freed from fellowship with
the bodie, not hindered by any fantasies of the senses, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all asleepe and quiet, then the mind hath best oportunitie
to attend and marke, to know and vnderstand, and also to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print
deeper in memorie things reuealed.</p>
            <p>Here we see the great care of God,<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> who would not haue his
children to receiue these visions by senses imperfectly: but that
they might throughly vnderstand, know, beleeue, and carie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
away in faithfull memorie, he deliuered them in extasies and
trances, the mind then being no whit hindred with fellowship
of the bodie, but freed from the same. The like care had he of
his Prophets: that they might certainely know, constantly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
and faithfully remember those visions, he would not haue
their minds troubled with the fellowship of the bodie, or of the
senses inward or outward.</p>
            <p>And there is good reason of this: for they which must teach
a thing to other, to make them know and vnderstand, to beleeue
and remember the same, it is reason they should vnderstand and
hold it themselues, and keepe it well in memorie.</p>
            <p>This seeing the Lord did,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> to make them to vnderstand more
throughly, to beleeue more constantly, and to carie away more
faithfully, this teacheth Ministers, that they must haue also the
through vnderstanding and knowledge of the word, beleeue it
constantly, and remember it carefully. Now we must not looke
for and expect trances, as they had, but we must come to this by
continuall studie in the word, which is the ordinarie meanes to
come to that knowledge: it is the meanes by which all men,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:14859:47"/>
Preachers, students and hearers do know. Then we should seeke
to be cunning in the text of Scripture, to vnderstand the proper
sense of it, to be good text men, to vnderstand, beleeue, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
it.</p>
            <p>Then this is a fault of those which in studying of diuinity,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> wil
rather reade auncient writings of men, nay the base writings of
of wicked and hereticall Friers, then of the holy word of
God.</p>
            <p>In that he receiued this vision &amp; will of God in a trance, and
had it so made fully known vnto him: we see, that though he was
indued with singular gifts, yet the Lord addeth more knowledge
to his former: so that we see that saying iustified, <hi>To him which
hath shall be giuen.</hi> S. <hi>Iohn</hi> being so carefull to do his dutie of an
Apostle, the Lord reuealeth his will to him in most full maner.
Euen so all that haue care to know the will and word of God,
though their knowledge be small at the first, yet the Lord will
help them, adde dayly to their knowledge and increase it. So
we see why many heare the word, but increase not, but waxe
worse, or stand at a stay: the reason is, because they labour not to
haue their knowledge increased; for if they did, then to him
which hath, he should haue more added.</p>
            <p>Nay contrarily, when we be negligent to heare and to know
the wil and word of God, we haue a spirit indeed, but not Gods,
but the spirit of slumber, of blindnes and ignorance: so that we
see and see not, heare and vnderstand not. <hi>Esay</hi> 29. 10.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>On the Lords day.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verse 10.</note> In these words is the fourth circumstance,
namely, the time when this vision was graunted to S. <hi>Iohn.</hi> This
day which here is called the Lords day, among the Iewes was
the first day of the weeke, called by vs Sunday.</p>
            <p>It is called the Lords day for two causes: first, because on this
day Christ rose from death to life: for Christ was buried the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
of the Iewes Sabbath which is our friday, and he rested in
the graue their whole Sabbath, which is our saturday, and rose
the first day of the weeke early in the morning, which is our
Sunday: and for this cause first it is called, <hi>the Lords day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 It is called the Lords day, because this first day, to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing
Iewes, was to them in stead of their Sabbath, in which
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:14859:47"/>
day they worshipped God solemnely: it was the day appointed
to his seruice among them, and for this cause especially it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Lords day.</p>
            <p>To vnderstand how it is called the Lords day, we must know
three points: first, who changed this day from the Iewes Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath:
secondly, for what cause: thirdly, whether the Church
haue now in the new Testament power to change the Sabbath
day to any other day then this seuenth day. The changer and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointer
of this Sabbath of the new testament was Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
though it be commonly thought that the Church in the
new testament and Christian Emperors changed it. My reasons
are these: 1. That which the Apostles deliuered and inioyned the
Church, that they receiued from Christ, either by voice or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct,
for they deliuered nothing of their owne head: but they
deliuered this, &amp; inioyned this Sabath to the Church, although
they receiued it from Christ. That they inioyned this day of rest
and Sabbath to the Church, it appeareth 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 1. For <hi>Paul</hi>
ordained that the collection for the poore should be on the first
day of the weeke, he ordained it, and left it not to the choise of
the Church, but appointed it by authoritie Apostolicall from
Christ. Now the day of collecting for the poore (as appeareth
in the histories of the Church) was the Sabbath day: when
the people were assembled, then they vsed to make their colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
for before that collection there went the word preached,
and the sacrament of the Lords supper: and this was the custom
of the Church many yeares after Christ, first to haue the word
preached and the sacraments administred, then to gather for the
poore: and for this cause the Lords supper is called a sacrifice,
or a masse, not as the Papists vse it, but because in it we offer, not
to the Lord,<note place="margin">Masse<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendo.</note> but to the poore, which was sent them, and so gaue
the name to that sacrament to be called the masse. By which it
appeareth, that they appointed by Apostolicall authoritie the
first day of the weeke to be the Sabbath of the new Testament,
which here is called the Lords day. A second reason is this. The
Apostles kept this day for the Sabbath of the new testament,
<hi>Act.</hi> 20. 7. and it cannot be proued that they obserued any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
day for the Sabbath, but onely in one case, when they liued
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:14859:48"/>
among the Iewes, when they kept their old Sabbath. A third
reason, is, <hi>Iohn</hi> 20. 19. 26. That same day which Christ rose from
death being the first day of the weeke, he appeared to his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
to instruct them; and the eight day after, he appeared again
the first day of the weeke, instructing them in matters belonging
to the kingdome of heauen. Now it is more then likely Christ
would celebrate and keepe that day for a Sabbath wherein he
rose, and the eight day after appeared to instruct his Disciples.</p>
            <p>Now the Sabbath of the Iewes was changed for two causes:
first, to maintaine the liberty of the Church of the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
whereof this was a great part, that they were freed from
the ceremonies of the Iewes: for here when this day was chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
the Church was no more tied to the Iewes Sabbath day,
neither had any such regard after of dayes and times.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that there might be a more fit time for the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of the worke of redemption: for as God in the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
appointed the seuenth day to be a day of rest, to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the first creation: so there should be a day to celebrate this
worke, which is a wonderfull creation, in which we are made
new men, so that there is now a new heauen, and new earth, as
<hi>Isay</hi> speaketh, chap. 66.</p>
            <p>Nay this is a more glorious work then that, seeing in that cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
<hi>Adam</hi> was the head, in this Christ Iesus he is the head. In
that <hi>Adam</hi> was the chiefe, in this Christ. In that <hi>Heuah</hi> was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to <hi>Adam,</hi> in this we to Christ, his Church to him. In that,
<hi>Adam</hi> had an earthly paradise, in this redemption we haue a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
kingdome. In that, Gods mercy onely, in this both his
mercy and iustice in punishing of Chirst, and giuing vs forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
appeared. In that, God shewed his wisdome &amp; goodnes but
in part, but herein this he shewed it fully. In that, he made man
of nothing, but now he made him of worse then nothing, &amp; bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then euer he was. Therfore seeing this day of our redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is farre passing that, and the Lord appointed a day for the
remembrance thereof, much more should there be one for the
remembrance of this: now there is no day fitter then that day
wherein Christ Iesus rose from death to life, to remember his
resurrection.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:14859:48"/>
But may the Church now in the new Testament change the
Sabbath to any other day,<note place="margin">Obiection.</note> as to tuesday, wednesday, &amp;c. <hi>Answ.</hi>
It cannot, I thinke: because times and seasons belong to God,
he alone can dispose of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 6. the church hath not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of times and seasons, much lesse of the ordering and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
of them: for that which the Father keepeth in his
owne bosome, the Church cannot know, but the Father alone
so keepeth times and seasons, therfore the church cannot know
them. And as the church of the Iewes had not power to change
their Sabbath, no more hath the Church in the new Testament,
to change their Sabbaths.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> But the Iewes had authoritie to appoint feasts: therfore
they could appoint Sabbath dayes. <hi>Hest.</hi> 9. 17. they for their
deliuerance appoint a day of rest, of reioycing. So 1. <hi>Maccab.</hi> 4.
8.<note place="margin">Answer.</note> They appointed indeed solemne dayes for reioycing, and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
feasts for speciall deliuerance, but they appointed not any
day for a sabath &amp; rest, for the whole seruice of God. Some hold
that the Church hath power to alter it, nay, to make any day the
Sabbath, or if it could be conueniently, two dayes in a weeke,
but they haue no warrant out of the word.</p>
            <p>If this day,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> the Lords day, be a day to remember the death, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
and merits of Christ, we see three sorts of men here
reproued: first them which make this day a day of pleasure, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stime
and delight. For most young men and seruants imploy
this day wholy on their own delights and pleasures, making it a
day of carnall reioycing, spending it in eating, drinking, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
dicing, riot and excesse, so that they turne this Lords day
set apart to his worship, into a day to offer sacrifice to the diuel.
The second sort is of them which liue more ciuilly then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
yet they thinke they may do their owne businesse, and take
iorneys on this day; and that vpon this false ground, that a man
may aswell and with as honest and good an heart serue God
in his owne businesse at home, as they which go to Church.
But by this they make the Lords day appointed to his seruice,
their owne day, to do their owne worke, and not his. The third
sort is, of those which keepe the Sabbath onely at morning
and euening Prayer, but as for the rest of the day, they may
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:14859:49"/>
spend it how they will, on their owne pleasures and pastimes, or
their owne businesse: and of this sort are many in the world, who
come to the Church but onely so far as the law of the Land in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioynes
them; and these men part stakes with God, they giue him
one part and that the lesser, and bestow the other on their owne
businesse or pleasure: whereas it is the Lords day, not in part but
in whole, and so they breake the fourth commaundement.</p>
            <p>Then on the contrary, our dutie is to keep this day a Sabbath
to the Lord, as we are commaunded in the fourth commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
1. we must rest from all our sinnes: secondly, from all the
workes of our callings, and imploy it wholly on the seruice of
God, sanctifying this day of rest to the worship of God from
the morning to the euening.</p>
            <p>Now there is a double sanctifying of the Sabbath, first pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke
in the congregation, when we come to the Church to
pray and giue thankes, and there to heare the word and receiue
the sacraments: secondly, priuate, when men in their owne pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
houses at home sanctifie it, in meditating, reading, and thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the word, in praying priuatly, and giuing thankes for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits:
we must not imploy that day in our owne businesse. If the
Officer should take our seruant from our works, &amp; set him about
the common good, we would be grieued. And if we take the day
appointed to Gods seruice, and bestow it on our owne affaires:
shall not the Lord be offended?</p>
            <p>And the cause why we heare the word publikely and neuer
profit, is, because we sanctifie the sabbath onely publikely and
not priuatly: so that vnlesse we meditate, reade the word, pray,
and sanctifie the sabbath at home, we may heare and reade the
word publikely, but without all increase of grace, faith, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and repentance: but if we performe neither, it is not possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to get any grace, seeing this day is set apart for that end.
Now to proceed.</p>
            <p>The reason why the Lord he gaue <hi>Iohn</hi> these visions, rather on
this day then another, is, because though <hi>Iohn</hi> was absent in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
from the Church, yet he was present in spirit, in praying for it
at this time: for being absent, he would shew his presence in
such duties as he could performe in that solitary place, as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:14859:49"/>
prayer, &amp;c. Now when he was thus occupied, the Lord
reuealeth his will to him concerning the estate of the Church
to the end of the world.</p>
            <p>Seeing <hi>Iohn</hi> being in the Isle of <hi>Pathmos,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vse.</note> a desert place, yet
he kept the Sabboth in all such duties as he could performe:
hence we see, that they which are absent from the Church, as
in prison, sicke of some great disease, or on the sea, yet they must
keepe the Sabbath, they must pray, fast, and call on the name of
God, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In that he receiued the vision then,<note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> when he was exercised in
praying and fasting, here is a comfort for the children of God,
that when men draw neare to God, he draweth neare to them,
<hi>Iam. 4. Iohn</hi> a worthie Apostle being in banishment, he
draweth neare to God in fasting and prayer, and the Lord he
draweth nigh to him, and reuealeth his will to him: so if we
draw neare to God by faith &amp; repentance, by prayer and inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of his name, then he will draw neare to vs. But if we draw
our selues backe from him, he draweth backe from vs. This then
should moue vs aboue all things to seeke to draw as neare him
as can be: then he will come and shew his goodnesse to vs. And
the cause why we are so litle acquainted with his goodnesse, is,
because we will not be acquainted with him.</p>
            <p>Now in the second place followeth, after the fourth circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
the parts of the vision, which be two: first, an entrance
into the vision: secondly, the representation of Christ as he is
King and Priest to his Church, which is the substance and chiefe
thing in this vision. The entrance is in these words: <hi>And I heard
a great voice behind me,</hi> till the end of the eleuenth verse: The vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
or the representation of Christ, from the twelfth to the end
of the third Chapter.</p>
            <p>The beginning and entrance into the vision, is a preparation,
whereby the holy Ghost maketh <hi>S. Iohn</hi> more fit to receiue and
marke things to be reuealed, which may be heard and seene.</p>
            <p>The meanes to prepare <hi>Iohn,</hi> is a voice: <hi>And I heard a voice.</hi>
The like to this we haue commonly in the old Testament, where
the Lord reuealing his will, doth send a voyce before, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
his seruants to receiue his will. So when he would giue the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:14859:50"/>
couenant to <hi>Adam Gen.</hi> 3. he prepareth him to receiue, and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
him heare a voyce in the garden which made him affraid,
and to hide himselfe: after the Lord speaketh to him face to
face, and giueth the couenant to him. So when the Lord wold
giue the law to <hi>Moses</hi> in the mount,<note place="margin">Exod. 19. 6.</note> first he sent a voice in a
mightie thunder, lightning, and sound of a trumpet: after he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
the law to him. 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. When the Lord would speake
to <hi>Samuel,</hi> he sendeth a voice to him three times, and after he
speaketh to him plainely, and calleth him by his name. So com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
in the old Testament, when the Lord will declare his
will to his Prophets, he prepareth them by a voice. So to <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,
Act. 10. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seeing the Lord dealeth thus with this most famous A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle,<note place="margin">Vse.</note>
when he receiued his will by extraordinarie reuelation,
being first prepared: then much more we which are sinfull men,
which haue not the thousandth part of those graces he had, of
knowledge, faith, and obedience, but are so farre short in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie
gifts, we must much more be prepared, that our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
and memorie may be made fit to heare, know and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
Gods will and word declared to vs. And the cause why
we increase not in faith, repentance, and knowledge after long
hearing the word, is, because we come vnprepared, without
looking that our vnderstanding &amp; memorie by all good means
may be prepared to receiue the word.</p>
            <p>The voice is described by the place, <hi>Behind me.</hi> Not before
him, but behind him, to stirre vp attention in him: for men most
marke those things which come as of a sudden behind them: so
this coming suddenly behind him, drew him to more earnest at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A great voyce.</hi> Thirdly, it is like the sound of a trumpet, not
onely a great voice, but full of power and maiestie, as the sound
of a trumpet. Now he vttereth these to stirre vp more attention
in him: for if he should heare an ordinarie voice, or a small voice,
it would not perhaps haue stirred him: but being a great, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull,
sudden, and a strange voice, it could not but make him
very attentiue.</p>
            <p>Seeing he vseth all these meanes of attention in <hi>Iohn,</hi> a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:14859:50"/>
Apostle, then much more must we vse all good meanes to
stirre vp attention in vs, seeing we in all gifts are a thousand
times inferiour to the least Apostle: seeing we be dull and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie,
and our senses not so sharpe as they shold be, we must
stirre vp our selues, seeke to be attentiue to that which which is
spoken:<note place="margin">Act. 16.</note> and as <hi>Lydia</hi> did, we must employ all our diligence to
make vs atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiue. And the cause why the word is preached with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
fruite, is, because we heare it without attention, and haue
no affection to it. Now that we may do this, we must beware of
two enemies of attention: the first, are by-thoughts, when a man
bringeth his bodie, but his mind goeth about his farmes, or
worldly riches, about a iourney, or bargaine, or some worldly
affaires.<note place="margin">Luk. 8.</note> These by-thoughts are thornes in our hearts, which
choake the good seed of the word, that it cannot prosper and
grow: for men which are troubled with them, cannot see how
one point dependeth and hangeth on another, but their memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
and vnderstanding is hindered.</p>
            <p>The second enemie is dulnesse and heauinesse of bodie and
soule, which is shewed in this, that we come heauie and sleepie
to heare the word, and spend that time which we should em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
in hearing, in heauinesse and sleeping. But if we will haue
the word fruitfull to vs, we must shake off this drowsinesse, be
affected with ioy and gladnesse, and heare the word with gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse.
If a man should come heauie and sleepie into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the King, especially he being to tell him of great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
or the giuing of him some great benefit, he would take it
for disloyaltie and contempt of his Maiestie. The cause why the
word hath no better effect in vs, but that after long preaching
and teaching, we be as blind and ignorant as euer we were, is,
because we come not prepared: contrarily, if we come prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
the Lord increaseth our faith, knowledge, obedience, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saying, I am Alpha and Omega.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vers. 11.</note> Before he described the
voice which he heard, as a meanes of this preparation, by the
place. Secondly, the qualitie, A great voice like the sound of a
trumpet. In these words he proceedeth further to describe this
voice in this eleuenth verse, &amp; setteth downe the substance and
matter of this voice which he heard: which standeth in two
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:14859:51"/>
things. The first, a testimonie, in these words: <hi>I am Alpha and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mega,
&amp;c.</hi> The second, a commandement, to <hi>write all these
words, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 The testimonie in substance is in the eighth verse before. In
which words of Christ, is, as before, a comparison: namely, as
<hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega</hi> are the first and the last letters in the Greeke
Alphabet: so I, Christ the Sonne of God, am the first and last of
all things; because before me there was nothing, neither after
me shall there be any thing in being and subsisting.</p>
            <p>These words proue the Godhead and eternitie of Christ the
second person. The end why Christ alleadgeth them, is, to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
him, that these things he was about to shew him came from
God, and therefore he bringeth his owne testimonie: namely,
I which speake vnto thee am God, therefore the things I deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
vnto thee are from God, euen from Iesus Christ the second
person in the Trinitie,<note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note> which am God equall to my Father.</p>
            <p>In this testimonie of Christ, note a singular care of God in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
of his Church: he is carefull not onely to reueale his will to
his Church, but withal to certifie his Church of the truth of the
same. As here he telleth <hi>Iohn,</hi> that they come from God, to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
his soule and conscience in the truth of the same: so he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealeth
not onely his will, but withall assureth men of the truth
thereof. <hi>Act. 10. Peter</hi> hath a vision, and withall the Lord
assureth him of the truth of that visio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And when Christ preached
his Fathers will, he wrought many miracles, which were as
s<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ales to confirme the same,<note place="margin">Vse. 2.</note> that it came from God.</p>
            <p>Seeing the Lord he doth not only declare his will, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
assureth men of the certainetie and truth of his will: this
first confuteth the Papists, who teach, that the word of God is
certaine in it selfe: but to vs it is not certaine till we heare the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie
of the Church, which maketh the Scripture which is
vncertaine to vs, though certaine in it selfe, to be certaine to vs.
But we must here know and learne, that the Lord doth not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reueale his will to his children, but withall vseth meanes to
certifie mens hearts of the truth thereof, and so the word of
God is most sure not only in it self, but euen to men, though the
testimonie of the Church shold neuer speake word of the same.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:14859:51"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. This confutes all carnall men. There be many which will be
of no Religion, because there is (as they thinke) no certaintie in
Religion: seeing mens opinions in matters of Religion be so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers,
that one cannot tell who speakes the truth. Indeed we dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
in many points of religion; and so many men, so many diuers
opinions: yet the true members of Christ they differ not in
the fundamentall points of Religion. And though all the world
should differ in opinion, yet it followes not there should be no
Religion: but the doctrine taught by the Prophets and Apostles
should stand sure, and be the true Religion of God for euer: and
the Lord can make men out of it to learne his will, and assure
them of the certainty of Religion.</p>
            <p>Now followeth the commaundement: <hi>That which thou seest,
write in a book, &amp;c.</hi> This hath two parts: first, <hi>S. Iohn</hi> must write
the things he receiueth: secondly, he must send them to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
famous Churches of Asia. Now the Lord commaunds <hi>Iohn</hi>
to write these things in a booke, and he must set downe that
which he receiued of God, to send it to the seuen Churches
of Asia: because he being now in banishment, and could not
come to them and be present with them to instruct them, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he must write these in a booke, that so they might be holpen
by them. Secondly, he must not only write them in a booke, but
send them to these seuen Churches: first, that they might be
confirmed and strengthened in the matters of faith, now in the
cruell time of their persecution: secondly, that they might keepe
these books for the Church of God which is the pillar &amp; ground
of truth: first, because it publisheth the word: secondly, because
she keepeth the same from time to time, and also giues testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the truth of the same. So then, that these Churches might
keepe, publish, and giue testimony of these things, he must send
them written to them.</p>
            <p>Hence we learne,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> that the word of God written, is an excellent
help for the church of God, to edifie the same: else he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
haue commaunded <hi>Iohn</hi> to send this booke to the seuen
Churches in Asia.</p>
            <p>This confutes first the Papists, who hold that the writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> word
is but a dead &amp; inky letter, a nose of waxe to be turned any way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:14859:52"/>
secondly, the Anabaptists who looke for reuelations, contemne
the written word: but seeing the Lord bids him send it to the
seuen Churches in Asia, he sheweth it is an excellent meanes to
edifie the Church.</p>
            <p>We may learne,<note place="margin">Vse. 2.</note> that the reading of this booke, as of other
Scripture, is Gods ordinance, whether it be publike or priuate,
and that they must be so vsed as Gods ordinance with reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and good conscience. Indeed the word preached is the
ordinary meanes to begin faith, and to worke repentance: but
the reading of them publikely and priuatly, hath his proper vse
to confirme our faith, yea to increase knowledge, faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
in vs.</p>

               <hi>Write, and send it to the seuen Churches, &amp;c.</hi> Here is the third
point, namely, that a man in the crosse and persecution may be
the deare child of God. <hi>S. Iohn</hi> a famous Apostle and deare ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant
of God, yet he is in banishment, and continues a long time
from all company of men; yet God reuealeth his wil to him, and
maketh him the pen-man of this book, which he giueth to none
but them which be his seruants. Then a man may be and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
in banishment, yet be the deare seruant of God. We reason,
if a man be in the crosse and persecution, and continue in the
same, he is surely out of Gods fauour, but we see the contrary in
<hi>Iohn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the end of the verse he setteth downe the names of these
seuen Churches in particular; and these seuen places were seuen
most famous cities in Asia, in which were planted seuen most
excellent Churches of all those parts of the world, and for that
cause here are named one by one.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then I turned backe.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verse 12.</note> Here is his preparation or entrance into
the vision. When I heard a voice behind me being loud and
great, I turned to see him which deliuered it to me. In the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
we must consider, first the meanes to moue <hi>Iohn</hi> to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
namely a voice: secondly the end, to make him atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue,
and to inioyne him his dutie, namely, to write, and to send it
to the Churches.</p>
            <p>Now followeth the second part of his preparation, which is,
that he turned backe when he heard this loud and great voice,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:14859:52"/>
to see who it was which gaue the voice.</p>
            <p>By this practise of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> we may learne our duty: for as he
dealeth with the man which giues the voice, so must we deale
with God. S. <hi>Iohn</hi> heareth a voice, and then he turnes backe to
see who it is: so must we do with the Lord; we are all by nature
ready to turne from God, and runne from him as fast as we can
by our sinnes. Now when the Lord speaketh to vs by the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of the word, when we are running on in another way. we
must turne to him, turne our hearts to his wayes, confesse our
sinnes to him, that so turning to him we may haue fellowship
with God. For vnlesse S. <hi>Iohn</hi> had turned to see the vision and
him which spake, he had not seene it: so vnlesse we turne to God
speaking in the ministery of his word, and that in time whilst he
speaketh to vs, we can haue no fellowship with him, though we
heare the word neuer so much.</p>
            <p>Now followeth the second part of the vision, which is the
representation of Christ his maiesty and magnificence, as he is
a Prophet, King and Priest of his Church, and it is set out by a
large description of Christ from this twelfth verse to the end of
the third chapter: In which description S. <hi>Iohn</hi> sheweth what he
receiued touching Christ, partly by hearing, partly by seeing.
And herein he describeth Christ, first by his place, <hi>In the midst of
the seuen candlestickes:</hi> secondly, by his forme and figure, <hi>Like to
the sonne of man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, he describeth Christ by the place, <hi>I saw seuen golden can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlestickes,
and in the middest one like, &amp;c.</hi> These seuen candlesticks
here seene of <hi>Iohn</hi> in a vision, are the seuen Churches in Asia.
Now as the Church of God is compared to a candlesticke, as
Christ expoundeth it in the twentith verse: so the particular
Churches are here called candlestickes, for their resemblance
which they haue with candlestickes: for as their property is to
beare and hold forth the candle and lamp: euen so the Churches
of God beare vp and hold forth, and publish the light of the
Gospell to the whole world, partly by preaching and maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
it, partly by professing the faith.</p>
            <p>
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Seeing euery Church is a candlesticke (and not a candle) to
beare vp and hold forth the lamp and light of the word,<note place="margin">Vse,</note> because
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:14859:53"/>
they haue no light of themselues, but onely can beare vp and
hold foorth the light, and are but the instruments of the light,
the true light being Christ himselfe; then they cannot giue light
to mens consciences and hearts, but all that they can do, is to
beare the candle, and hold out the light, by instructing and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the word, and by their profession of religion.</p>
            <p>In that they are compared to candlestickes,<note place="margin">Vse. 2.</note> we learne that
all the true members of Christ are candles, burning and shining
lights, placed in the shafts of this candlesticke. For though the
Ministers must especially be blazing lampes to the people, as
<hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> was, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 35. yet also are all true members of
Christ these blazing candles to hold foorth this light, and shew
foorth the doctrine of light to the world. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 15. 16. Euery
man in his calling must be a shining candle, and a burning lamp.
Now that he may be such a one, he must first haue knowledge
of the will and word of God himselfe, then as a blazing candle,
send foorth the same to others, by teaching and instructing, by
godly life and conuersation. We all professe we be members of
Christ, and members of the true Church, then we must carie
and hold foorth these burning lights, hauing light in our selues
to send it out to others, by teaching them in our calling, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
godly, and giuing good example, and so shine to the world.</p>
            <p>To induce vs to this, to carie our selues as burning lampes:
first, it is the commandement of God, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 15. Euery man in
his calling must be a blazing light in the middle of a peruerse
nation: we must carie our selues free from all sinne, send out our
light to all men. For a second reason, marke the fruite and the
effect which followeth this carying of our selues as shining
lights. When a man is indued with knowledge of Gods will
and word, and sends out this light by instructing others, and in
a godly example, he winneth many men to the kingdome of
heauen. A man if he haue one to hold him out a candle in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that he may see his way to go whither he would, he taketh
this as a great benefit: how much more is this, to light the way
to a blind man euen to the kingdome of heauen? But on the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie,
when men be dimme and darke candles, and liue not in
the Church as blazing lights, but in sinne, ignorance, and loose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:14859:53"/>
of life, hence great hurt and daunger cometh to men with
whom they liue. For when a man knoweth the will of God, and
yet liueth in sin, he giueth a false direction, and so many follow
him euen to the pit of hell: and by his bad example, he draweth
men as much as in him lyeth,<note place="margin">A Similie.</note> to eternall destruction. In hauen
townes, if a man remoue the night marke, and the candle set to
direct the ships, he doth as much as in him lyeth to sinke all the
ships: for they hauing wrong direction, runne on rockes and
sands, because they go to the light which is not in the right
place, and so they misse the channell, and light on rockes and
perish. So men in this world, they saile as on the sea, to heauen:
now if we by our wicked life remoue the marke and giue wrong
direction, they must needes misse the right way, and so come to
a false hauen, not heauen but hell. And so then, seeing either by
our godly life we draw men to heauen, or by our bad life we
carie them to hell, it is our dutie to labour by life and doctrine
to giue good direction.</p>
            <p>The third reason to moue vs to be burning lights, is the
iudgement of God: for he which liueth in the Church, and yet
shineth not in teaching others by his good example, he incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
the iudgement of God. In the temple the lights and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
belonged to the Priest who dressed and trimmed them,
&amp; for that purpose he had snuffers and such instruments: now in
the Church euery man is a candle, standing in the church as in a
sticke: Christ Iesus he is the trimmer and dresser of them, he
standeth in the midst of them, he hath his snuffers in his hands,
he trimmeth them and dresseth these candles. Now if after three
or foure times dressing and snuffing of this candle, still it burneth
dim and will not shine out, he will either remoue it out of the
sticke, or else he will take and tread it vnder his feet. So those
which in the Church do not send out a shining light, the Lord
he dresseth and snuffeth them, but if they still burne dimmely,
cast not a cleare light in instructing others, and leauing good
example, the Lord will cast them out of their places, put them
vnder his foot, and cleane extinguish them. In regard of this
daunger, euery man in his shaft and place, the Minister in his,
the vnlettered man in his, must teach others, giue good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:14859:54"/>
else the issue will be this, the Lord will come in iudgement
and stampe it out, and extinguish that light. Nay, very reason
requireth this at our hands, seeing we be all lights of this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlesticke
of the Church, that we should send out light. In win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
time we hang out lights, that by them men might be dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to helpe them in their iourney: and shall we be so carefull
to helpe men in temporall light, and not much more carefull to
helpe them in light toward the kingdome of God? Let then all
ignorant and loose liuers, as there be many among vs, let them
now begin to shine: for they stand in the place of good lights,
they be in the candlesticke: they must cease from ignorance and
loosenesse of life, and beginne to burne and cast light as good
candles, both by doctrine and good example.</p>
            <p>If a man should bring a candle in a sticke to vs, and we shold
go about to light it twice or thrice, and it would not take light,
we would in anger cast it downe: so Christ if he vse meanes to
light these ignorant and loose-liuing persons many times, if
they refuse to be lighted, he in his displeasure will cast them
downe out of the candlesticke, and not suffer them to take the
place of a good candle, but rather tread and stampe them vnder
foote.</p>
            <p>In the Church of God there be many ignorant persons, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
which continue in their ignorance &amp; rebellion, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in sin: but a small number of good blazing lamps. Many
hold the place of good lights, but are darke, dimme, and giue
no light, let these feare Gods iudgements. Would any be true
candles, burning and blazing lights? let them first get know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in the word and will of God, furnish and replenish their
hearts with knowledge, and after practise the same faithfully in
obedience, in leading a godly life, shining to other in holy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
exhorting and instructing them, that so shining foorth
clearely and chearefully, Christ standing in the middest of
the lights, may like and allow of them. For vnlesse we shine thus
in this candlesticke, to wit, the Church of God, where we haue
our places, we shall neuer haue light, nor ioy in the kingdome
of heauen: but if we do, we shall then shine as the Sunne,
cleare and faire for euermore.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:14859:54"/>
               <hi>Golden candlestickes.</hi> That is, made of gold: so called for two
causes. The Church of God is compared to a candlesticke of
gold: first, because as gold is most excellent of all mettals: so the
Church of God is the most excellent of all societies and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of men. All companies and societies of men, in the familie,
towne, citie, kingdome, commonweales, they be all the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of God, and excellent in their kinds: but the Church of
God is aboue all these, it is most excellent, no societie cometh
neare it: first, because in the Church there is saluation to be had
and obtained, but in none of these societies of men it is to be
had, as they be societies of men, but as they be Churches, or
true members of the Church.</p>
            <p>2 It is a most excellent societie, because this is the end of all
other societies, they be all ordained to maintaine this, as the
chiefe, and this euen the Church of God, is the end of them all.</p>
            <p>3 The Church it beautifieth and adorneth all other societies,
because herein is their honour and preferment, in that they be
either Churches, or members of the true Church.</p>
            <p>Seeing the Church is the chiefe and most excellent societie
in this world,<note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note> we must aboue all things haue speciall care to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
members of this societie. Men haue care and labour to
become members of those townes which be in corporations,
and haue freedomes aboue other: then much more should we
labour to be members of that societie which is most excellent,
to be true members of the Church of God.</p>
            <p>Seeing this is the chiefe societie,<note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> and all referred to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
the Church of God, it must be our speciall care to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
that Church, euery man in his calling, as the King,
Prince, and Magistrates, the Ministers in their callings, yea eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man in his particular calling must seeke to preserue this so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie.</p>
            <p>Seeing this societie adorneth the other,<note place="margin">Vse. 3.</note> &amp; giueth them their
beautie, we should labour to bring all societies to this. Men in
families must seeke to make their familie a Church, or a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the true Church: they which rule a towne, to make it a
true member of the Church, and to make it an ecclesiasticall so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie:
so Kings to make their kingdome a Church, &amp; member
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:14859:55"/>
ber of the Catholike Church, because al other societies without
the Church, are but as places without light, and without the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlesticke
to hold vp: and without this light, they be in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and the shadow of death. It is compared to a golden stick,
because it is most precious to God, none so deare, none so neare
to God, as this societie of the Church. Christ therfore to expresse
how deare it is, saith it is a seale to his hand, and a signe on his
right arme. <hi>Can. 8. 6. Zachary</hi> cals the Church the apple of Gods
eye, shewing it is most deare in Gods sight, as precious as the
apple of the eye, which is most tender to vs. <hi>Psal.</hi> 45. it is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to the Queene in a vesture of gold: nay, no societie is so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and deare to Christ as this, seeing he hath shed his owne
heart blood, euen the blood of God, to redeeme his Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the middest of the seuen golden candlestickes.</hi> Christ is in the
midst of them, that is, he is present with his Church continually
in all times: he hath continuall care of it, to gather his Church,
and being gathered, to preserue it and defend it from all her e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.</p>
            <p>Seeing Christ is in the midst of his Church present to gather
and defend it:<note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note> then the supremacy of the Church of Rome,
whereby they will haue one head of all the Churches on earth,
is needlesse: for Christ is present, gathering and defending his
Church at all times: then there needeth no generall Vicar. In the
presence of a king, they of a commission cease, though they were
assigned before: and if any should be so impudent as to take on
him the office of a king in his presence, all men would condemne
him: so though Christ had giuen this office to the Pope, yet
seeing he is present at all times in his Church, to gather and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
it, the generall gouernement of the Pope is needlesse, and
it is extreame arrogancy to take on him the office of Christ in his
presence.</p>
            <p>Seeing Christ is in the middest of his Church,<note place="margin">Vse. 2.</note> we must do
as <hi>Enoch, Gen.</hi> 5. 22. walke with or before Christ: when we take
any thing in hand, do any thing in word or deed, we must do all
in Christs presence. We must do all we do, that we may haue ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
of Christ, for he is in the midst of his Church, to looke
to it, to defend it, he seeth what we do; therefore do all that he
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:14859:55"/>
may like of it, and approue it. That we may do so, we must haue
direction for that we do out of his word: and if we be able to
walke before Christ, we shall be able to do many duties to him,
and be vnblameable in this wicked world.</p>
            <p>The second argument whereby Christ is described, is his
forme and shape <hi>Like the son of man.</hi> Hence some gather, that it
is not Christ, but some Angell which is described; but they are
deceiued, for he is called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the first and the last, and he that
was first dead then aliue, which belongs to Christ alone. <hi>Like
the sonne of man,</hi> but more significant it is in the originall, Like a
sonne of man: if it be translated, The sonne of man, then Christ
must be vnderstood: but in the originall it is, A sonne of man, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the phrase of the old Testament, where when they
would signifie one that was a man, they called him, A sonne of
man, that is, man like a man in forme and shape.</p>
            <p>Christ is said to be <hi>like a sonne of man,</hi> not that he appeared to
<hi>Iohn</hi> in his manhood, for that was in heauen, but in a likenesse,
appearance and resemblance of his manhood: and as he doth
not appeare here, so in no place after his ascension he appeareth
in his true manhood. <hi>Stephen</hi> saw the sonne of man stand at the
right hand of God, <hi>Act.</hi> 7. but that was in heauen: and <hi>Paul</hi>
heard him speake, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. and being rauished, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. but then
also he was in heauen.</p>
            <p>And this Christ doth to a speciall end, to shew that whereas
men much regard and esteeme his bodily presence, as his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
and friends did, who had too great a desire of it, we must
not seeke to haue earthly familiaritie with him, but we must lift
vp our hearts by faith, and so haue spirituall familiaritie and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with him.<note place="margin">Iohn 20.</note> And so he biddeth <hi>Mary,</hi> touch me not,
being not yet glorified, to checke her too much desire of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
presence: but he would haue her and vs to lift vp our hearts
by faith, and haue spirituall familiaritie and acquaintance with
him in heauen.</p>
            <p>Then hence, the defence of consubstantiation and reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the body of Chirst is in the sacrament, is but needlesse,
seeing it is sufficient Christ is present in spirit, not bodily any
more, but we must lift vp our harts to heauen, and there for euer
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:14859:56"/>
liue and rest in him.</p>
            <p>The Papists gather of this, in that Christ appeared after his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension
in the appearance and forme of a man, that they may
make the image of Christ, who being God appeared in the
forme of a man. Secondly the Father, who is figured by an old
man, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. and the holy Ghost in the forme of a Doue, they
hold they may picture the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not in any forme but in that they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared.
<hi>Answer.</hi> It is not vnlawfull for vs to haue the pictures of
the Father, Sonne and holy Ghost as they appeared in forme, as
Christ in a man, the Father in an old man, the holy Ghost in a
Doue, to illustrate and set out the history: but we deny and hold
it vnlawfull to haue any of them, or the picture of Christ (if it
were to be had) to religious vses, to put vs in remembrance of
Christ, to worship God, in, or at, or by it: for thus to worship God
is flat against the second commaundement.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clothed with a garment downe to the feete.</hi> In these words fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
is described the garment and attire wherein Christ ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to <hi>Iohn.</hi> The first part of his attire, is a long robe or gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
down to the feet. He appeared in this kind of garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, first
to shew he was the high Priest of the new testament after his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension,
to do the the office of the high Priest, because this was
one of the garments which the high Priest vsed when he offered
sacrifice. So Christ hauing offered himselfe on the crosse, he is
still high Priest for vs, to make intercession for vs to his father.
Secondly, he appeared in this kind of attire, to shew he is the
Prince and King of peace, because this long robe and garment is
in all nations, where it is vsed, a signe of peace: so Christ hauing
this garment, is not a King of war but of peace. <hi>Esay.</hi> 9. Thirdly,
to shew he excelled in wisedome and counsell: for this garment
in all nations which vse it, was giuen to them which excell in
wisedome and counsell: so Christ here is clothed with this long
stole and robe, to shew that he excelleth in the spirit of wisdome
and counsell, because the spirit of wisedome is in him without
measure. <hi>Esay 9. 6. Col.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>Hence for the attire of our body,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> we learne that it must be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
and answerable to those good things which be or ought
to be in our hearts, as this garment of Christ, to shew he was
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:14859:56"/>
high Priest: secondly, that he was King of peace: lastly, that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled
in wisedome and counsell. So our attire should be such,
which may signifie the vertues which be in vs, as our knowledge,
obedience, sobrietie, temperancy, humilitie, and all the good
gifts and graces of God: we must not onely shew out the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of our hearts by word, but euen our attire must set out what
they be. And as we must be candles, in teaching and instructing
in life and conuersation: so we must shine and shew forth the
vertues of our heart by our attire. But alas our practise is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
for our apparell is now sutable to all our corruption and vices
of our hearts, to set out our pride, to preach to the world our
lightnesse and loosenesse of life, the vanity and folly of our heart:
so that if a man see one go, though he neuer be acquainted with
him, neuer spake to him, yet he may know his fondnesse, folly,
loosenesse of life, pride and corruption of his heart by his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell.</p>
            <p>The second part of his attire, is, that he was <hi>girded about with
a golden girdle about the breasts:</hi> which is to shew, that Christ was
ready prepared to do all the offices of a Mediator for vs: for the
girding vp of the body, the binding of mens apparell to them,
is a signe of diligence and care to do ones dutie; as the not gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the clothes, but to leaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> loose, is a signe of neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
and carelesnesse. Then seeing Christ is girded vp, it sheweth
he is ready prepared to do the office of a Mediator to all men:
and so Christ whilest he was on the earth he shewed this, he sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
all the poore sinners which came to him; and since his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
he is not negligent, but ready prepared, girded to do
the office of a Mediator to all true penitent sinners.</p>
            <p>This must be a singular comfort to all which haue any sparke
of grace, that Christ he is ready to attend on them, to do the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of a Mediator for them. When we be in affliction &amp; crosse,
he is ready prepared at our elbowes to deliuer vs and comfort
vs: when we be ready to die, he is not farre off, but stands by vs,
ready to cary our soules to heauen; in all things he is ready to all
the workes of a Mediator, to helpe vs in all the workes of our
saluation. Christ he is not like <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Butler, who promised
<hi>Ioseph</hi> to remember him, being promoted to honour out of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:14859:57"/>
prison, but after being exalted in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> house, forgot him,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 40. But Christ he is still now as readie as euer he was in
earth to helpe vs, and to do all the workes of a Mediator for vs.</p>
            <p>Then we must imitate Christ,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> and haue our loines girded vp.
<hi>Luk.</hi> 12. we must be prepared and made readie to do all our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
to call vpon the name of God, to giue him thankes, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
our faith and repentance daily: yea euery day make our
selues readie to die or to liue, and to be alwaies readie to do all
the workes concerning our saluation, and at all times to carie
our selues so, as we be readie to enter into heauen at any time.
But we neuer thinke of this, we are readie to no good thing, we
neuer thinke of death till it knocke at the doore. Oh let vs labor
to become good followers of Christ, hauing our loynes girded
vp, readie prepared to all good workes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>About the paps:</hi> not the belly, but breast. Some thinke (and
not vnfitly) to shew, that his thoughts and affections which
came from the heart, they be most perfect, ranged in, not
subiect to any sinne, but guided by the spirit, which with full
measure dwelleth in him bodily.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And his head as white as wooll.</hi> Now <hi>S. Iohn</hi> describeth Christ
by the parts of his bodie: first, his head is as white as wooll or
snow, which is to shew the eternitie of Christ: for though as he
was man he had a beginning; yet as he is God, he is eternall: he
is the auncient of dayes, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. and when all things began, he
was before.</p>
            <p>Seeing our Sauiour Christ vseth this hoarinesse and white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of the old gray head,<note place="margin">Vse</note> to set out his eternitie and euer-being,
he would shew the excellencie and honor of aged men, of the
old gray headed man, which other younger want: and for this,
he compareth the old gray head to almond trees which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
white. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 12. 5. and <hi>Prou.</hi> 16. 31. it is compared to
a siluer crowne, not made by man, but made and placed by the
hand of God on the aged mans head. This excellencie of the
hoarie head is in this, that he beareth in his person the image of
Gods eternitie, before all younger men: he standeth in the
roome of God, to shew Gods eternitie to men: namely, in this
old and white head of his.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:14859:57"/>
Now seeing the aged man hath this excellencie aboue young
men, he must be reuerenced: young men must rise to him. <hi>Leuit.</hi>
19. and we must in their hoarie head learne the image of Gods
eternitie. They which be such, which in regard of their age haue
this excellencie aboue others, they must excell others in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and experience, in wisdome and holinesse, 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 13.
I write to you fathers, which know the father which hath bene
from the beginning: shewing, he taketh it for granted, that aged
men which be fathers, should haue knowledge in the will of
God. Secondly, they must exceed others in holinesse of life.
God is holy, they beare his image, therefore they must (seeing
they beare his image aboue others) go before yong men in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse.
And therefore <hi>Salomon, Prou.</hi> 16. 31. compareth old
age to a siluer crowne ioyned with righteousnesse, which, when
they be ioyned together, old age indeed is a glorious orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Then men must take heed that old age be no disgrace vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, nor dishonour, but an ornament and commendation.
But alas, miserable is our dayes, when young men excell old, in
knowledge and wisdome, in godlinesse of life and conuersatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
and other gifts of the Spirit: but it should not be so, but as the
aged must go before them in preferment and excellencie, so they
should go before them in wisdome, knowledge, experience and
godlinesse. And if in these which weare the siluer crowne on
their heads, there be found sinnes abounding, and loosenesse of
life, it is much more dishonor in them then the younger, though
in neither commendable. And it is not enough for old men to
say, their memorie, conceipt and knowledge faile them: for this
sheweth they haue liued a bad and loose life, and mis-spent their
younger age: but they must labour, that with their siluer crowne
on their head, they may haue a siluer life in heart and hand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And his eyes were as a flame of fire. S. Iohn</hi> goeth on to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
Christ in vision by the parts of his bodie: now in han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling
these parts, though no man can set downe certainly what
the holy Ghost intendeth in euery point, yet we must consider
what is most probable in the word of God. <hi>And his eyes, &amp;c.</hi>
He addeth these, to signifie two things: first, to shew that our
Mediator is of a most piercing, sharpe, and quicke sight, so that
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:14859:58"/>
he beholdeth all things in earth, euen the secrets of our hearts,
for he hath fierie and piercing eyes: and as fire entreth and pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
all mettals, so Christ by his fierie eye pierceth into the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
and secrets of the hearts. Now it is necessarie that the
head of the Church should be so sharpe of sight, that he might
behold the whole Church, see all the enterprises of the diuell,
and the estate of all his children.</p>
            <p>Seeing Christ is of so piercing and fierie a sight,<note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note> that he seeth
the very secrets and thoughts of our hearts, we must haue care
not onely of our words and actions, but of ordering our
thoughts and affections: for Christ pierceth into our hearts and
seeth them: therefore we must looke they be in order that he
may approue them. It is true, thoughts and inward affections,
with men beare no action, because men know not the heart and
affections: but it is not so with God, he seeth the least inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and purpose of our hearts, and he keepeth court of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
not onely for words and actions, but for thoughts and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.
Therefore men must take heed they be well ordered,
and so of Christ approued, that for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they be not condemned.</p>
            <p>Christ he seeth our hearts and our very inclinations:<note place="margin">Vse. 2.</note> then we
must in matters of religion be indeed that we seeme to be: for
though we can bleare mens eyes with outward profession, and
they can go no further: yet the Lord he hath fierie and piercing
eyes, and seeth our hearts, and how we be but hypocrites if we
be not indeed that we seeme outwardly to be. Yet men must
stay and suspend their rash iudgement, and not for the profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of religion iudge men to be hypocrites: for God alone
searcheth their hearts.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he is thus described, to shew, he is full of anger
and iudgement, and readie to take vengeance of his enemies:
that is, of them which will not giue themselues, and turne to him
by repentance, in obeying his will and word. For though Christ
be a Redeemer and Sauiour, yet he is also a iudge, &amp; in indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
will execute his iudgement on his enemies, euen vpon all
that refuse to haue him to rule ouer them: as he saith, <hi>Those
mine enemies which would not haue me to rule ouer them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk 19. 27.</note> 
               <hi>bring
them that I may kill them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:14859:58"/>
This may serue to awake many drowsie and secure professors:
for men now in this barren age liue in sinne and ignorance, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
thinke of the duties of faith and repentance, take pleasure
in sinne; it is meate and drinke to them to liue in securitie: not
one of a thousand turneth to God by heartie repentance. Let
these know, that though they liue closely in sin, yet Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth
them, not as a Redeemer, but as a Iudge, with fierie and
piercing eyes, readie to execute iudgement on them for their
sinnes. They then must consider their owne estate in time, and
turne to God, lest that they going on in their sinnes, and snor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in securitie, Christ come vnawares, and cut them off in his
anger: for it is a fearefull thing to fall into the hands of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And his feet like to fine brasse.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vers. 15:</note> The word signifieth brasse,
which is shining, for substance durable &amp; pure, the very choice
and excellentest kind of brasse. This he addeth, to signifie the
inuincible power of Christ, that he is able to encounter, nay,
hath alreadie encountred with sinne and Satan, wounded them,
and bruised their heads to powder: for his feete are strong and
durable, he is of power to ouercome his enemies, to tread them
vnderfoot, and grind them to powder: and not onely in his
owne person, but in his members, he is most powerfull.</p>
            <p>Seeing he hath brasen feet,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> strong and durable to ouercome
his enemies and tread them vnderfoot, this is a singular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
to the children of God, who if they be exercised with any
temptation of Satan, or with any affliction and griefe, they must
not be discouraged, but seeke to Christ their head, he will in vs
(as he hath before in his owne person) bruise the serpents head,
and breake it to powder. Let vs then put our cause to Christ, and
let him haue the whole ordering and dispensation of it: so, if sin
and corruption hang on vs, vexe and oppresse vs, we must flie
to him, make him acquainted with it, seeke helpe from him, and
we shall doubtlesse find it weakened and wounded, nay bruised
to peeces, by his helpe. If we see the terrors of death, we must
not feare too much: for Christ is strong, and able to ouercome
death, nay he encountred with sinne and Satan on the crosse,
ouercame him there, and went downe with him to his owne
denne and cabine, and there vanquished death: so that he hath
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:14859:59"/>
subdued and brought him vnder foote, and made him his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoole.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And as this is a comfort to the godly, so it should be a terror
to the wicked, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> without repenting liue in their sinnes: for
Christ hath a foote of brasse, he wil bruise them in peeces, make
them his foote-stoole, and with his brazen foot grind them to
powder. Then they which be as yet enemies to Christ, must turne
to him, leaue their old maister Satan, come to him, else he will
breake them to nothing, by his strong and brasen foote.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Burning as in a fornace.</hi> The feete of God as of men, in the
Scriptures often signifie his or their wayes: so here the feet of
Christ signifie his wayes or workes. <hi>Burning as in a fornace:</hi> this
sheweth the perfection of Christs wayes, they be vncorrupt: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
as brasse purified in the fire, so be they, most pure, most vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spotted,
without all drosse; all his wayes, his counsels and works,
either of creation or preseruation, all are without fault. <hi>The way
of God is vncorrupt, the word of the Lord is tried in the fire: he is a
shield to all that trust in him.</hi> Psal. 18. 30.</p>
            <p>Seeing all his wayes are pure and most holy,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> we must speake
and thinke of them with reuerence, euen of his secret iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
whereof we know no cause nor reason; we must reuerence
them, and aknowledge that they are pure of themselues. In mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Religion there is a learned ignorance, whereof this is not
the least point, to content our selues with his wayes, and not
curiously to search into those things which he hath not reuealed
in his word: but though they be against reason to man, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
them as holy &amp; true, with reuerence, for all Christs waies
be holy. The blind man cannot iudge of the light, because he
seeth it not: no more can blind man (such as all be) iudge of
workes hidden with God.</p>
            <p>The Lord bids <hi>Abimelech</hi> giue <hi>Sarah</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> else he wil

to reason in mans iudgement; but we must reuerence the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:14859:59"/>
counsels of God, as good, pure, and holy, though we see no
cause at all of them. The Lord hath determined to saue some, to
cast off other some: now this seemeth crueltie to man: nay some
hold it an action of crueltie, that the Lord should withhold his
mercy from one, and shew it to another. But they sinne, seeing it
is the doctrine of Gods word, that he in his good will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
hath determined to saue some, to reiect other for his
owne pleasure: though we see no reason at all of this, we must
reuerence it, and hold it the truth of Gods most holy counsell.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And his voice as the sound of many waters.</hi> This he addeth for
two causes: first, to shew the loudnesse and greatnes of his voice,
because this voice of Christ in his word hath gone through the
whole world: for the doctrine of Christ hath bene sounded in all
parts of the world. Secondly, to shew the power, force and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
of this voice in the eares of his creatures. Christ before all
things were, but spake the word, and at his word all things were
made. <hi>Lazarus</hi> lay rotting in his graue, yet he heard the voice of
Christ, as of a thousand trumpets sounding in his eares, and rose
vp: nay the bodies of men being dead sixe thousand yeares, euen
those shal heare the voice of Christ, being a loud and great voice,
a powerfull and effectnall voice.</p>
            <p>Seeing this voice of Christ is so loud and powerfull a voice
that the dead are able to heare it:<note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note> this shewes the securitie and
deadnesse of those men, which though they heare it dayly soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and crying in their eares, as the noise of many waters, yet
they will not, as did the dead bodie of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> heare and stand
vp, and come forth of their graues of sinne, but still snort in
securitie and rot in their sinnes. This argueth our great drowsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
that the dead which haue layne six thousand yeares, shall at
this voice rise and awake, and we hearing it both loud and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull,
and publike in our eares, will not put vp our head nor our
heart, not seeke to get one foot out of the graue of sinne and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie.</p>

               <hi>And he had.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vers. 16.</note> Here S. <hi>Iohn</hi> describeth him by his parts, and
the properties of euery part. <hi>In his right hand seuen starres:</hi> that is,
seuen Angels, seuen Ministers of the seuen churches of Asia. The
Ministers are compared to starres: first, because as starres send
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:14859:60"/>
out light to men on earth; so the Ministers ought to giue light to
men, euen spirituall light, by doctrine taught by them, and by
conuersatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of life among them. Secondly, they be compared to
stars, because as the stars haue their continuall abode in heauen,
neuer descend downe: so the Ministers of the word especially
should haue their conuersation in heauen. It is the dutie of all,
but more specially of the Ministers, in regard of their callings:
first by seeking their owne saluation: secondly, by seeking the
saluation of others: by which two they must haue their conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, though they haue their bodies in earth: thirdly,
because they shall be honoured of God in heauen, as the starres:
for <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. they which do their dutie, they <hi>shall shine like starres
in the firmament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They be in Christs <hi>right hand:</hi> that is, all regiment and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement
in matters of the Church belongs to Christ, he alone
hath the whole disposition and ordering of the ministery: seeing
he alone is head of the Church, and the Ministers they be in his
right hand: he rules and raignes in his church, he careth for it and
looketh to it.</p>
            <p>Seeing these starres be in Christs <hi>right hand:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note> this shewes that
the choosing &amp; furnishing of the ministers of the word, belongs
to Christ, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. he giueth them their gifts and places: then we
ought in this last age to pray the Lord to send out laborers into
his haruest, that so his children might be gathered, and an end
made of these miserable dayes.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <hi>He holds these seuen starres in his right hand.</hi> Whereby we see,
he giueth them defence and protection, so long as they be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in their callings. He carieth them in his right hand: &amp; though
they haue sundry discouragements, yet seeing Christ he ordereth
their ministery, and disposeth of it, if they be faithfull, nothing
should hinder their course, nothing should cut them off from
their duty, neither the want of obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in them to whom they
preach and labour, not seeing that fruit they should; nor the iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the enemies of their profession; nor any thing else.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Seeing they be in his <hi>right hand:</hi> this sheweth the excellency
of this calling of the ministery. Idle men esteeme it most base, &amp;
accept of it as of a meane calling, and so discourage many: but in
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:14859:60"/>
the sight of God it is an high and holy calling, he carieth them in
his right hand, defends them and protects them. Now what
greater glory can there be, then that they should be so honored,
to be borne and caried in the right hand of the King of heauen
and earth, though wicked men dishonour them, esteeme so base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? This should stir those who haue good gifts, to get this
high and holy calling, thus to be honoured of Christ.</p>
            <p>They must be vnblameable:<note place="margin">Vse. 4.</note> for seeing Christ carieth them in
his right hand, he will hold nothing but that which is holy and
pure, as he is; but if it be defiled, sinfull and wicked, he will take
it out of his right hand, put it vnder his brazen foote, and grind
it to peeces: and the more he had honoured them, the more will
he dishonour them. By the same reason, the hearers are bound to
profit, else they must drinke of the same cup: for if the ministers
be punished for not preaching, then they for not hearing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And out of his mouth, &amp;c.</hi> In these words he describes him
by the two last parts of his body, his mouth and his face, <hi>And in
his mouth was a two edged sword, &amp;c.</hi> By this two edged sword, is
meant the doctrine of the law and the Gospel, vttered and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
by the Prophets and Apostles: and this two edged
sword is described, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 12. It is mightie in operation, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The doctrine of the law and the Gospell is compared to a
two edged sword; because as a sword with a double edge enters
not onely into the flesh, but to the bones, yea euen to the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row:
so the word preached it enters into the heart deepely, to
the diuiding of the spirits; yea it enters to the very bottome of
the heart, it searcheth euery nooke and corner which is most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret.</p>
            <p>The word hath a double operation, one in the wicked, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the godly. In the wicked this sharpe two edged sword of
the word, it wounds them at the heart with a deadly wound,
and so by the same wound brings them to eternall death. <hi>Esa.</hi> 11.
4. He shall with his breath, that is the sword of his word, slay the
wicked.<note place="margin">1. Thess. 2. 8.</note> This is that sword that hath and will kill Antichrist.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> But how cometh it, that the word of God should wound
or kill any? how should it slay a wicked and vnrepentant sinner?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> We must know there be three degrees of spirituall death:
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:14859:61"/>
The first is, the separation of bodie and soule, when the bodie
is laid in the graue, the soule conueyed to the place of torments.
The second is, when a sinner in this life by the word is wounded
and smitten, and so receiueth in his heart a deadly wound. The
third degree is at the end of this life, at the last iudgement, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
soule and bodie shall go into hell fire: for euen a sinner receiueth
his deadly wound in this life, which is the first steppe to hell and
eternall death in the life to come.</p>
            <p>In the inflicting and giuing of this wound, there be three a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of Christ required, which he worketh in the hearts of
the wicked by the doctrine of the law and the Gospell. The first
is, to reueale to them their sinnes, all their pride, rebellion, hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie,
the damnable corruptions of their hearts, and all their
sinnes against the first and second Table. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 24. 25. If
in the Church all prophecie, there come in one which belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
not, he is rebuked of all, because they iudge him an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite,
and so the secrets and corruptions of his heart are laid o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
and discouered by the word preached. The second action
of Christ is this, he after reuealeth to them the wrath and curse
of God against sinne, his indignation against the breakers of the
law: and for this cause the law is called the killing law, because
it sheweth iudgement without mercie for the transgressions of
the law. Thirdly, Christ by the word preached sharpeneth the
sting of conscience, maketh it awake, and terrifieth a man when
he heareth or remembreth the word, and the curse denounced
against sinners. So <hi>Felix</hi> when <hi>Paul</hi> preached to him of iustice
and temperancie, he fainted and trembled, the word was a two
edged sword of the spirit to wound his conscience with terrour
and feare. So <hi>Dan. 5. Beltashar</hi> seeing but an hand writing, he
quaketh for feare, the word of God came into his mind, and
made his conscience accuse him, and his knees smote together
for feare.</p>
            <p>So then by this we see how Christ killeth the wicked, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealing
their sinnes, shewing the wrath and anger of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
sinne and sinners which repent not, and the curse of
the law: and also by sharpning the sting of conscience, to wound
them and strike them at the heart; and so they by this haue the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:14859:61"/>
first wound of eternall death. Though the Lord may in mercie
recouer them of this wound, yet of themselues they be in the
estate of death; and vnlesse they repent, they are in the first step
to eternall death. For those horrors and feares which come into
a mans heart in regard of Gods wrath and iudgements, seuered
from grace, are no grace, but the first wound to eternall death,
vnlesse the Lord giue grace.</p>
            <p>Seeing Christ carieth the two edged sword of the Spirit in
his mouth,<note place="margin">Vse. 2.</note> whereby he woundeth his enemies with a deadly
wound at the heart: then when we see any which cometh to
heare the word, and after rebelleth, stormeth, and rageth against
the same, being wounded in conscience therewith, we must not
be displeased with it, but pitie his case, seeing he is wounded at
the heart with a deadly wound: and he in this case is in the first
steppe to eternall death, vnlesse the Lord recouer him of this
wound.</p>
            <p>In those Churches and places where the word hath bene <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
long preached, and the people remaine in blindnesse and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and vnreformed, we must in these take pitie on them, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this is a heauie iudgement of God on them: for these are
wounded with a deadly wound by the sword of the spirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the word hath bene long and often preached to them
without profit: and the word it neuer returneth emptie, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
saueth or destroyeth, woundeth or healeth them. So that
though men may liue ciuilly before men, making a faire shew,
yet if they be vnreformed and liue in ignorance, these are but
dead men in the sight of God: the word hath giuen them the
first deadly wound, therefore we must pitie their estate. If we
come into the field, see an hundred men lye wounded, and gush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out bloud, some in the head, some in the sides, and some in
the feet, we cannot but be exceedingly moued: so in the church
of God many are vnreformed in obedience and repentance:
and though we cannot see their bloudie wounds with bodily
eyes, yet we may see them lye wallowing in the bloud of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and securitie, of impenitencie and wickednesse, therefore
we must pitie their estate: for they be dead men indeed, seeing
they be not reuiued by the word in reformation of life and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience:
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:14859:62"/>
for the word either quickeneth or killeth.</p>
            <p>Seeing the word without grace killeth, we must not content
our selues with it, but seeke to feele the worke of the Spirit,
peace of conscience, and reformation of life by the word. Let
vs then by a liuely faith labour to apply Christ by the word, to
lay hold on him and his righteousnesse, so that we can say, we
liue not, but Christ in vs. But this word hath another action in
the elect children of God, which though it be manifold,
yet all tend to further and procure their saluation. The first work
of it in these, is to wound deepely, and to kill the corruptio<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
of mans nature in his heart, with a deadly wound, that it neuer
recouer againe. Yet though it wound a man, it killeth not the
person, as in the wicked, but onely the corruption of his heart,
and quickeneth the person to Christ, killeth him in regard of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
and vnbeleefe. We are sacrifices to be offered to God,
therefore we must be killed, not in our bodies and soules, but
in our corruptions, affections and rebellions. That we may be
killed, the two edged sword of the Spirit is required, which gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
our corruption the deadly wound, and cutteth vp the root.
Since the second action after our conuersion &amp; change is this,
the word of God must cut and pare the remnants of our corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
by lessening and weakening of it daily. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15. As the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman
cutteth, loppeth and pareth off all branches that
beare no fruite: so the word of God cutteth and pareth away
the remnants of corruptions in our hearts, that so our hearts
may bring foorth more fruite. Thirdly, the word of God serueth
to keepe his people and children in awe and subiection, and
therefore Christ holdeth the scepter of the word in his mouth,
that though the wicked will not be kept in awe, yet his elect
may tremble and feare at the lifting vp of the same. Amongst
men if many be fighting, let the Magistrate but hold vp the
sword of Iustice, euery man yeeldeth and putteth his sword into
his sheath: and shall not we much more cease from sinne, and
feare, when Christ the King of heauen and earth, holdeth out
the scepter of his word? And if any refuse to be subiect, and to
obey the Magistrate, he is counted a rebell: if men refuse to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
the scepter of Christ, shall they not be so accounted?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:14859:62"/>
So then by these actions we see the power of the word, it kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
corruptions in our hearts, pareth it and the remnants of it,
and it keepeth men in awe and subiection. Yet it differeth in
the wicked, and in the godly: in the wicked, it maketh them
feare, and woundeth them to death, destroying both soule and
bodie: in the godly, it woundeth them indeed, not in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
but in the corruptions of their hearts. It maketh vs fit to
encounter with the diuell, and to vanquish him in all his temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
if it be vsed with knowledge.</p>
            <p>Seeing the word of God serueth to kill our corruptions,<note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note> we
when we heare the word, must receiue and beleeue the
same, not onely when it is deliuered in generall, but applyed in
particular: though it touch vs and wound our hearts, we must
suffer it, and reioyce in it: for that is the first steppe to health, to
haue our corruptions ripped vp and touched. When the sword
of the spirit entreth to our hearts, it will ransacke euery nooke
and secret corner: then we must reioyce in this blessing of
God, suffer it gladly, seeing it is the onely meanes to come to
life. If one be sicke of a Fistula, he will suffer the Chirurgeon to
rippe and launce him, to search euery part of the wound: and
shall not we suffer the Phisition of the word to display, to lay o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
to ransacke and search the corruption of our hearts, seeing
that is the onely way to recouer health. For we cannot liue to
God till we die to our selues and to our sinnes: we cannot p<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

our sinnes killed and wounded to death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In his mouth.</hi> Other Kings carie their scepter in their hands,
but he in his mouth, to shew, that no doctrine must be receiued
of vs, vnlesse it proceed from his mouth: for he receiued his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

and they to vs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And his face shone, &amp;c.</hi> For as the Sunne is to the world, so is
Christ to his Church. Now as the Sun performeth two duties
to men, so doth Christ: the first is, to giue light and driue away
darkenesse, to take away the night, and bring the day: so Christ
he is the Sunne of righteousnesse. <hi>Malach.</hi> 3. He giueth the
light of knowledge to his seruants, he sendeth the light of the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:14859:63"/>
word which can dispel darknes, and enlighten his people in the
knowledge of his will and word.</p>
            <p>Then are we bound to labour aboue al things for knowledge
of his will and word.<note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note> First, when the day dawneth, we set open
our doores and windowes, to receiue the light and comfort of
the same: now Christ is in the midst of his Church, he sendeth
light, he shineth clearely, being the Sonne of righteousnes: then
we must open the doores of our hearts, and the windows of our
soules and consciences, to receiue his light and comfort into vs.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Seeing Christ giueth light by his word, we must in all our life
be guided and directed by that light. We are pilgrimes, going
through a vale of misery and darknes, Christ is the light, he shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
as a blazing torch: we must then do all our duties by dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of this light, we must in all our wayes haue our eyes fixed
in this word which is the sonne of light and direction.<note place="margin">2. Pet. 1. end.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The action of the Sunne is to warme and comfort dead and
cold bodies, and to reuiue them: as we see in the spring time, it
reuiues those creatures which before were as dead with cold: so
Christ giueth not onely light but life, he giueth spiritual comfort
to bodies frozen for cold, he comforts them &amp; reuiues them by
his spirituall heate, and for this is called the Sunne of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
comforting our cold and frozen hearts in sinne and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie.</p>
            <p>Then we must labour aboue all things,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> to be partakers of this
spirituall life and comfort, which cometh by the spirituall heate
of Christ. As men will in winter go into the Sunne, to feele the
heate of the beames: so must we come out of our sinnes, get into
the sun-shine of Christ, that his beames may streame vpon vs
plenteously, to haue life conueyed to our benummed and dead
consciences. We will seeke to haue honour, riches, preferments,
and pleasures of this life, but <hi>Psa.</hi> 44. we should desire the Sunne
of righteousnesse to shine on vs with the beames of mercy, to
haue him quicken our dead hearts with the heate of his holy
spirit.</p>
            <p>That we may haue this spiritual life, we must die our selues ere
we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> liue to the Lord: we must first be killed ere we be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue.
If we wold liue to God, we must suffer the two edged sword
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:14859:63"/>
to pierce to the heart, to cut vp and cut off all our corruptions, to
suffer it to enter into vs, to ransack our rebellious harts, and to be
thrust to the hilts, that so it may diuide betweene the spirit &amp; the
flesh, pare off al the rotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> flesh of corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in vs: for when we are
killed to our selues, &amp; discouraged in regard of our own sins, we
are most fit to be made aliue to God. A body which is almost
dead for cold, is the most capable of heate: and when we are thus
cast downe in regard of our sins, then we must labor to haue the
comfortable beames of Christ to shine in our hearts, to warme
and to quicken vs, and his fauourable countenance to shine on
vs: which if we haue, though we haue neither honour, riches nor
preferment, yet we haue enough: and if we want that heate, all
things else are nothing.</p>
            <p>The third worke or action of the sun is to discouer all things.<note place="margin">Vse.</note>
In the night nothing appeareth, all haue one forme; but when
the Sunne cometh with his light, all things appeare, and a man
may in the beames see the very motes: so Christ the chiefe sunne
seeth all things, and he will discouer all: nothing so secret which
is hid from him, nothing so close which his eye seeth not: he
knoweth, and he can and will discouer all mens actions, yea their
secret thoughts.</p>
            <p>Seeing Christ knoweth all our thoughts,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> so as he can make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
manifest and open: note, that though we may liue so as men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
iudge of our hypocrisie, yet Christ seeth our dealings: &amp; as
the sunne is manifest to our eye, so our actions are cleare to his
eye. This should make vs take heed to all our waies and workes,
that we do or thinke nothing but as in his presence; for we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
blind his eyes, but he seeth it euen as clearely as we see the
light of the sunne. If men of occupations would consider this,
that all their actions are cleare to Christ, they would not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
so much crueltie and iniustice; there would not be so many
sins practised of vs dayly as there are.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And when I saw him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vers. 17. 18.</note> 
               <hi>I fel at his feet as dead.</hi> In these seuenteenth
&amp; eighteenth verses, <hi>Iohn</hi> proceeds to describe our sauior Christ
as God gaue him a vision, by other arguments, that is, by his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.
The first action is contained in these seuenteenth and 18.
verses, which is a confirmation of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> being greatly afraid:
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:14859:64"/>
and this confirmation is the whole matter and substance of these
two verses. In this note two things: first, the occasion: secondly,
the meanes. The occasion mouing Christ to confirme S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> in
the second part of the seuenteenth verse: the meanes, in the end
of the seuenteenth verse &amp; in the eighteenth. The occasion was
an exceeding feare of death, which made <hi>Iohn</hi> as dead, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
by Christs comforting of him.</p>
            <p>In this feare note 3 things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> first, the cause: secondly, the effect of
it: thirdly, the kind of feare. The cause in these words, <hi>And when
I saw him, &amp;c.</hi> which was the appearance of Christ to <hi>Iohn</hi> in his
maiestie and glory, which made <hi>Iohn</hi> exceedingly feare.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>S. Iohn</hi> seeing the maiestie and glory of Christ, he is excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
afraid and astonished as a dead ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. We all by nature since
the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> are fearefull sinners. Before he fell he walked
&amp; talked with God face to face, but after his fall he fled and hid
himselfe, he could not brooke his presence, because he had sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
and since his fall, mans frailtie and weaknes is such, that he
cannot abide the presence and maiestie of God: but as <hi>Manoah
Iudg.</hi> 13. 22. seeing an Angell of God, said, <hi>We shall surely die, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we haue seene God:</hi> shewing that the presence of God, of his
maiestie, is terrible to sinfull man: euen so it is with all men.</p>
            <p>Now seeing we haue lost our first estate, we must labor conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
to haue the image of Satan abolished in vs, and the image
of God daily renewed: we must become new creatures, &amp; seeke
aboue all things to haue our former fellowship with God which
we lost in <hi>Adam:</hi> for in this fellowship with God stands all true
happinesse and ioy eternall.</p>
            <p>Seeing it feared <hi>Iohn</hi> that he was as dead,<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> we see that the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the presence of God, of his maiestie and glory, it is a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
meanes to humble man, to cast him downe, and make him
know he is nothing in himselfe. So soone as <hi>Iohn</hi> perceiued and
saw the presence of Christ, he was as dead, &amp; fell at his feete. So
<hi>Abraham,</hi> the more he perceiued the glory of God, the more he
humbled himselfe, confessing he was dust and ashes. And <hi>Peter
Luke</hi> 5. 8, 9, 10. seeing but a glimmering of Christs maiestie and
might, he bids him depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, he was a sinner. So <hi>Esa.</hi> 6. 2. the
Angels couer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues with their wings, with three they coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:14859:64"/>
their face, and with 3. their feet, as fearing and not able to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
his maiesty, as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessing they be nothing but sin in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues.</p>
            <p>We see the great goodnes of God in the ministery of his word,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
for though he might speake to vs by his own self, and so that we
could not abide to heare his voice, but should be as dead men,
yet he in mercy speaketh to vs by sinfull men like to our selues
and familarly: then we must know and learne to acknowledge
his mercy, and be thankfull for it.</p>
            <p>Seeing it astonished <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> we see that euen holy and
righteous men cannot abide the presence of Christ his maiestie
and glory: much lesse can the works of righteous men stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his iust iudgement, or answer to his iustice: for the person
must be first accepted before the worke can be accepted: now
if a righteous man cannot abide the presence of Christ, no more
can his worke. Then damnable is the doctrine of the Church of
Rome, who will haue men to stand at Gods bar, and bring their
workes as part of their iustification, but our workes be but in
part holy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no more then we be our selues but in part iust.</p>
            <p>Now followeth the effect of this feare in S. <hi>Iohns</hi> body:<note place="margin">2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Point.</note> 
               <hi>He fel
at his feete as dead.</hi> It was not a small but a great feare, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonished
his senses, made him as a dead man. Phisitions
say, that the mind followeth the constitution and temperature
of the body, but we may here as truly say, the body followeth the
temperature and constitution of the mind: for the mind can
worke that on the body, which other diseases can worke: it can
cast men into a swound, make the body cold, and many other
things which diseases work in the body. So <hi>Ahab</hi> being grieued,
and fearing he could not get <hi>Naboths</hi> vineyard, was sick and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
dead. So then affections of loue, and feare, and hatred, &amp;c.
can change &amp; kill the body: therfore the body followeth the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature
and constitution of the mind. Againe, we see diseases
are not alwayes to be cured by art and phisicke: but often when
phisicke cannot helpe, the body is cured by ordering and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
the affections of the heart, seeing these can order and
dispose the body, and change it as their nature is.</p>
            <p>The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the next place followeth the kind of feare: <hi>I fel at his feet
as dead, &amp;c.</hi> shewing it was a godly &amp; religious reuerence in the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:14859:65"/>
heart of <hi>Iohn:</hi> for this kind of prostrating the body, is a signe of
godly reuerence and religious feare.</p>
            <p>We must learne by this example,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> to cast downe our selues in
the presence of Christ as <hi>Iohn</hi> did, and to lie prostrate at his feet.
<hi>Ob.</hi> But some may say: Christ is not present, we cannot now fall
at his feet, seeing he is in heauen. <hi>Answ.</hi> Though Christ be
now in heauen, yet he hath his footstoole on earth, and his feet
may be said to be here on earth. For the <hi>mercie seate,</hi> that was
a signe of Gods presence, though that be taken away, God
hath yet his footstoole on earth. <hi>Psal.</hi> 99. 5. For wheresoeuer the
Church of God is assembled to pray vnto him, there is Christ
truly present, and there is his footstoole, and there should we
cast downe our selues, our soules and bodies to Christ, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there present. Now though <hi>S. Iohns</hi> feare be a godly feare,
yet it is stained with sin: for it is ioyned with immoderate feare
of death. Then we see, that the most holy affections of righteous
men, they haue their imperfections, they be stained with sinne,
because they be sanctified but in part, and in part be corrupt.
And there is no man which hath true filiall feare, but he hath
withall a seruile feare of hell and damnation.</p>
            <p>The meanes follow whereby Christ confirmeth <hi>Iohn. Then
he laid his right hand.</hi> In this note two things: first, when he v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
this meanes: secondly, the meanes it selfe. The time when,
<hi>Then,</hi> that is, after Christ by his presence had smitten him, cast
him downe, and laid him as dead: then he vseth meanes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
and comfort. And this is Gods practise, first, to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a man and cast him downe, breake him and bruise him to
powder: then he hauing made him plyable and fit to receiue
grace, after confirmeth and comforteth him in the matter of
saluation: secondly, a man must be wounded, then haue oyle
powred in, and he must be a lost sheepe, after Christ will bring
him home againe. And this is the cause why so few profit by the
word preached and by the Sacraments, because they be not
first humbled and cast downe, and made fit to receiue Christ
comfortably offering himselfe in the Gospell. Now follow the
meanes themselues, which are two: the first, a signe, <hi>Then he
laid his right hand, &amp;c.</hi> secondly, his word, <hi>saying, Feare not, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:14859:65"/>
There is not one of them vsed a part, neither the signe, nor
the word alone: but he vseth both meanes, more to confirme and
comfort <hi>S. Iohn.</hi> So the Lord dealt with <hi>Moses. Exod.</hi> 3. 12. he
first giueth him the word, I will be with thee to comfort thee:
and not onely that, but the signe, he must offer sacrifice to God
as a signe.<note place="margin">Esa. 7. 4.</note> So to <hi>Ahaz,</hi> though a wicked king, he giueth him
his word to comfort and confirme him: and <hi>vers.</hi> 11. he biddeth
him aske a signe of him. So Christ preached the Gospell, there
is his word, and confirmeth the same by miracles. Now he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
vs promises of eternall life; and not onely that, but addeth
signes and seales to confirme them: namely, his Sacraments. By
this we see that Christ hath exceeding care of his children and
of his Church.</p>
            <p>Seeing he vseth al meanes to confirme them and to comfort
them he giueth them not onely his word, which might be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,<note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note>
but for our weaknesse he addeth signes to confirme vs,
condescending thus to our capacitie, to take from vs all doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
and to giue vs assurance, euen out of the maner of vsing
the meanes: as here first he vseth the signe: 2. the word: then he
putteth his hand on <hi>Iohn</hi> to assure him of his protection, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
biddeth him not to feare. By this order we see, that the very
assurance of Gods presence and protection, is a present reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
against all feare of death and desperation. If a man be assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of Gods presence, aide, and helpe, he needeth not to feare.
So <hi>Moses</hi> being affraid to go before the people, the Lord to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
him <hi>(Exod. 3.)</hi> telleth him he will be with him: and <hi>Dauid</hi>
considering God protected him, saith: <hi>Psalm. 23. He would not
feare though he were in the shadow of death.</hi> Then it is our dutie
to labour to haue the assurance of Gods protection and assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
which will stay vs against all immoderate feare of death.</p>
            <p>Now after this he addeth reasons to confirme his owne
words to <hi>Iohn,</hi> when his word might haue serued alone. The
first reason is in the end of the 17. verse: <hi>I am the first and the
last.</hi> He is the first, because nothing was or can be before him;
and the last, because nothing is or can be after Christ. And he
addeth these two phrases, to shew his Godhead and eternitie,
and that Christ alone hath in his hands the beginning and end
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:14859:66"/>
of all things: all things haue their beginnings of him, he of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:
but he giueth the beginning to all things, and he alone
putteth the end to all things. Now seeing he hath power to giue
beginning and end, therefore he can preserue his seruants from
death, he can keepe them from condemnation. And he hauing
power to begin and end all things, can giue and begin his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
can end and accomplish the same at his pleasure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And am aliue</hi> (or he that liueth) <hi>but was dead.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vers. 18.</note> In these words
is the second reason, which Christ alleageth, to proue his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
words, and to make <hi>Iohn</hi> not to feare death too much.
The reason consisteth in a distinction, thus: Although I was dead
yet now I am he which liueth, I haue power of death, of hell,
&amp;c. This distinction hath three parts: first, though <hi>I was dead, yet
now I liue:</hi> secondly, <hi>I liue for euer:</hi> thirdly, <hi>I haue power of death,
and the keyes of hell, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And I am he which liueth.</hi> Here life is ascribed to Christ in a
speciall maner: that is, he liueth not as all other creatures liue,
but in a more peculiar maner of liuing. Christ vseth this phrase
<hi>I am he that liueth:</hi> first, to shew he hath life in himselfe: second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that he giueth life to others.</p>
            <p>First, he hath sufficient life in, of, and from himselfe: which
appeareth thus: life is two-fold, vncreated or created: vncreated,
as the life of God which is infinite, eternall, in and of it selfe suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient.
Now Christ as he is God he liueth by this vncreated
life, which is all one with his Godhead. Secondly, there is a
created life, which is twofold: first, naturall preserued by meate
and drinke: secondly, spirituall, which is by immediate fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
with God, when we liue by the immediate operation of
Gods spirit, not by meat and drinke. And Christ he liueth this
spirituall life, so that he liueth, first, by an vncreated life as he is
God: secondly, he liueth a spirituall life, his bodie and soule be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sustained in the second person of the Trinitie: therefore he
hath in himselfe most absolute and perfect life. And he giueth
life to others two wayes: first, as he is God, and so he giueth life
to all men good and bad: he is the author life in all things which
liue.<note place="margin">Act. 17.</note> 
               <hi>In him we liue, moue, and haue our being:</hi> he giueth life and
he preserueth the same. Secondly, he giueth spirituall life to his
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:14859:66"/>
Church and children as he is redeemer of mankind: he liueth
that we might liue by him. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 19. and as he died not for
himselfe alone, so he liueth not for himselfe alone, but for vs,
that we by him might haue spirituall life: as appeareth <hi>Colos. 3.
Our life is hid with God in Christ.</hi> And for this cause, thogh Christ
be in heauen, yet we eate his bodie and drinke his bloud really
in a spirituall maner, and they be the spirituall nourishment of
our soules. We liue by the spirituall life of Christ; and that for
these two causes: first, because he hath sufficient life in himselfe:
and secondly, because he giueth life to others: therefore he saith,
<hi>I am he which liueth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seeing Christ giueth this spirituall life,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> we must seeke it at
him, and labour that we may say, that <hi>we liue not, but Christ in vs,</hi>
and that <hi>our life is hid in Christ:</hi> for Christ he liueth spiritually,
that he might bring spirituall life to vs: then we must labour to
haue this. We can be content to seeke farre and neare, to take
exceeding paines to get gaine, to maintaine this our momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanie
&amp; earthly life, which is but as grasse, yea as a fleeting sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
and as a span: and shall we not be much more carefull to
get spirituall life which lasteth for euer? But the practise of men
is cleane contrarie, not one of a thousand laboureth for spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
life, but all are bewitched with the ouer greedie desire of
things of this life, &amp;c. The reason of this is, because mens hearts
are not touched with the burthen of sinne, and the curse of God
on vs for sinne, and therefore it is, that no man seeketh to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
from sinne, to haue this spirituall life with Christ our
head. This we may see in that woman <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. Christ telleth
her, he is the bread of life; she beginneth to cauill with him,
but when he toucheth her speciall sinne, then she hearkeneth
to him: so if the Ministers tel the people of matters of saluation,
vnlesse they first cast them downe, &amp; make them see their sins,
they will but quarrell and cauill at it and the doctrine of the
Gospell. Christ is the water, nay the well of life: now we must
be thirstie and parched with thirst, and then we will seeke for
water: and we must not onely lightly tast, but seeke to be dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
and diued in this fountaine, to haue our soules sowsed and
soaked in this water: and if we could know that Christ liued in
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:14859:67"/>
vs and we in him by spirituall life, it would be a present remedy
against all persecutions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And behold I liue for euer,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vers. 18.</note> 
               <hi>Amen.</hi> Here followeth the second
part of the distinction: namely, <hi>Though I was dead, yet now I liue
for euer:</hi> which second part of the distinction is propounded
with two notes: the first of certaintie, <hi>Amen,</hi> to assure vs that
that which Christ auoucheth before of himselfe, is vnfalliblie
true: the second note is of attention, <hi>Behold.</hi> This serueth to stir
vp attention in <hi>Iohn</hi> (and in vs) to a serious and due considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that part of the distinction, <hi>I liue for euer:</hi> therfore Christ
saith, <hi>Behold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Behold I liue.</hi> Here note two things: first, in regard of what
nature Christ liueth for euer: 2. to what end. He liueth for euer as
he is the Mediator of the church: <hi>ergo,</hi> in regard of both natures,
as he is God &amp; man. In regard of his Godhead he liueth for euer
by the vncreated or essentiall life of God, which is all one with
his Godhead, which is for euer, of it selfe, not by any other. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
he liueth for euer in respect of his manhood, for after he
ascended into heauen, there he liueth in glorie with the Father
and holy Ghost: because in the manhood of Christ dwelleth the
power of the Godhead bodily, <hi>Colos.</hi> 2. The second thing is,
why he liueth for euer: namely, that he might giue eternall life
to his Church, and all his true members. God giueth vs eternall
life by his Sonne, 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 11. and this is the ground of all ioy:
this, that Christ liueth to giue vs eternall life, is the foundation
of the Church, and the ground of our happinesse. We must then
consider of Christ as a roote: he liueth not for himselfe, (as a
roote doth not liue for it selfe) but to giue life to all the branches
and true members of the Church. And we must consider of the
manhood of Christ, as a common treasurie or storehouse of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
happinesse: therefore <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. Christ saith: <hi>My flesh is meat
indeed, and he which eateth his flesh and drinketh his bloud shall liue
for euer:</hi> shewing, that his flesh and manhood hath power to
giue life and quicken his true members: yet not as considered
in it selfe, but as the same is ioyned with the Godhead, and is
the manhood of God, and the flesh of God: for it hath all this
power from God,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:14859:67"/>
The meanes whereby he giueth eternall life, is, the mysticall
coniunction betweene him &amp; his members. First, God the father
giueth Christ to the Church and euery true member of the same,
as he hath promised to giue him. Now he giueth him as he is
Mediator of the Church, euen whole Christ, yet the Godhead
of Christ is not giuen of the Father, but onely by the operation
thereof in the manhood, whereby the manhood is made able to
satisfie Gods iustice: but the manhood of Christ that, is really
giuen, his very substance, his flesh and bloud is really giuen to
euery beleeuer, and the benefits of the manhood also are truly
giuen vs, as righteousnesse and life eternall, as really as lands or
goods are giuen to men. Now to whom Christ is giuen, with
him God giueth the Spirit of Christ: for Christ and his Spirit
come together: and this Spirit createth in the heart of a
man the instrument of faith, by which Christ giuen of God
is receiued of vs: and we by faith apprehend his bodie and
bloud, and the merits thereof. And we receiue not Christ in
imagination, or in our braine, but euen as God the Father
giueth him, in the word and Sacraments really and truly.</p>
            <p>And as the spirit of Christ createth in vs faith, so it knitteth
vs also to Christ our head really, though mystically: now from
this mysticall coniunction betweene Christ the head and vs the
members, proceedeth eternall life, thus. First, he which is ioyned
and knit to Christ in this life, and receiueth him, he beginneth
by this coniunction to liue an eternall life, in dying to all his sins,
and to liue to God, to liue as Christ liueth, a spirituall life. And
this I may call the first benefit of our spiritual vnion with Christ.
Secondly, man thus vnited shall rise to glorie in his bodie. And
so the second fruite of this mysticall coniunction with Christ, is
the resurrection of the bodie: for this coniunction with Christ
after it is begunne, it is perpetuall, it is neuer broken: so that
though a man lie in his graue many thousand yeares, yet he is
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnited to Christ, is in the graue a me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of Christ, &amp; by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of this mysticall vnion he shall be raised at the last day. As
we see the sappe of trees in winter time is in the roote, and the
branches seeme to die: but in the spring, when the heate of the
Sunne cometh, then it creepeth out into the branches, and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:14859:68"/>
they bud and bring foorth fruite: so man hath his winter time
in the graue, but in the last day because he is ioyned to Christ
the roote, he shall haue his Sommer, and be raised by the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of this mysticall vnion. Thirdly, man so vnited shall liue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer:
therefore the third benefite is eternall life and happinesse.
By this mysticall vnion we shall haue eternall felicitie and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
life in heauen, there we must possesse it, but it cometh
from this mysticall vnion with Christ our head. In this life it is
begun, and is neuer broken, in regard of the roote and ground
therof, but lasteth for euer, and by it Christ conueyeth eternall
life to vs.</p>
            <p>In these words, <hi>Behold, I liue for euer, Amen,</hi> is the ground of
two maine articles of our beleefe: namely, of the rising of the
bodie: and of life euerlasting: for Christ he liueth for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
to giue life to vs for euer; and this is the ground of our ioy: as
to <hi>Iob, I know my Redeemer liueth, &amp;c.</hi> Now doth Christ liue
to giue vs life in heauen?<note place="margin">Iob 19.</note> then we must haue our conuersation
in heauen, for where Christ is there should be our conuersation,
because he is the foundation and ground of eternall life to vs.
Now that our conuersation may be in heauen, we must often and
seriously consider of this eternall life purchased to vs by Christ:
and for this cause he saith, <hi>Behold I liue:</hi> and withall as we must
consider of it, we must haue our affections set on him, our ioy,
reioycing and affiance; because Christ liueth that he might keep
eternall life for vs. We vse to haue most care to preserue that
part wherein life is preserued: so seeing Christ is the foundation
of our life, and the author of it, we should haue most care of him.</p>
            <p>Now followeth the third part of the distinction, though <hi>I
was dead, yet I haue the keyes of hell and death.</hi> In these words we
must not imagine hell to be a bodily place, kept with locke and
key as our houses be. Nay, it cannot be proued out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
that it is a bodily place, or the punishment of hell in regard
of our soule and conscience is bodily, seeing it is the sense &amp; fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of Gods wrath and vengeance in bodie and soule, therfore
it is rather spirituall. But Christ here borroweth a comparison
from earthly stewards, who when they haue any thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to them, and haue the keyes put into their hands, this
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:14859:68"/>
sheweth they haue power and authority of al. So Christ hath the
keyes of hell and death, that is, power ouer hell and death, and
dominion of them both. As if he had said, Though I once was
dead in the graue, yet now I haue power and dominion ouer hell
and death, and haue vanquished them both.</p>
            <p>Seeing Christ alone hath power ouer hell and death,<note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note> no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
else properly hath authoritie to forgiue sinne, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Christ; for he which can forgiue sinne, must haue power ouer
hell and death: but he can take away death the punishment of
sin, and hell the reward of it: <hi>ergo</hi> he alone can forgiue sin. Then
we see the Priesthood of the church of Rome is full of blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
who hold, that man called thereunto, can properly forgiue
sinne; not only pronounce sinne to be forgiuen, as the reformed
churches hold, and which they denie, but properly to forgiue
sinne.</p>
            <p>Seeing Christ hath power ouer hell and death, we must reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
him, do him all honour and obedience we can: if we haue
not done this already, yet now to begin; if we haue, then to do it
more. Seeing he hath the key of death, he can shut &amp; open, saue
and destroy. But if we dishonour and disobey him, then he will
not shut but open the doore to death and hell to plague vs. We
thinke all is well, Christ he is a Sauiour, and all shall be well; he
is mercifull, and so make him our packehorse of our sinnes: but
we must know, he is not onely a Sauiour but a Iudge, he can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
and saue, open and shut, he hath the key of heauen and hel,
and of death.</p>
            <p>This is a comfort to the godly, which cleaue to Christ, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
he can keep them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hell &amp; death, so as they cannot hurt them:
and this consideration might comfort vs in time of persecution,
in the time of sicknesse or any calamitie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Write these things.</hi> In these words he describeth Christ by a
second action: for after he had comforted S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> now he giueth
him a commandement, which commandement was giuen in the
eleuenth verse before, and here repeated to <hi>Iohn</hi> againe. First,
because Christ intended by this to shew <hi>Iohn</hi> his especiall care of
his Church, that he is now still a prouident and carefull head of
his Church, and therefore sayth not once, Write these things,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:14859:69"/>
but the second time, that the Church of God might vnderstand
in al ages to come, that it is necessary me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should know the estate
of the Church: for else he would not haue repeated it againe, if
it had not bene very necessary. It is necessary for men to know,
that the estate of the church is to be in troubles, that they might
the better prepare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues to beare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Thirdly, he doth it, that
S. <hi>Iohn</hi> might be more assured certainly of his calling to write
and pen this booke. Fourthly, that the Church in all ages might
be fully assured &amp; without doubt, that this booke is a booke of
God, and part of holy Scripture, not inuented by man, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed
by God to <hi>Iohn,</hi> for the good of the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> But though Christ reuealed his wil aright, <hi>Iohn</hi> might
mistake it, and erre in penning. <hi>Answ.</hi> S. <hi>Iohn</hi> penned this booke
both for matter and maner, as Christ gaue it to him: for this we
must know, that there is a difference betweene Apostles and
Prophets in the old and new Testament, and Ministers of the
Gospell; for they were called immediatly by God and Christ,
and had speciall assistance of the spirit of God: which appeareth
by those promises they haue made to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by God: as Christ saith,
<hi>He which receiueth you, receiueth me, &amp;c. Luke</hi> 10. 16. And, <hi>It is
not you which speake, but the spirit of my Father,</hi> therfore feare not.
And <hi>Iohn 14. The holy Ghost shall leade you into all truth:</hi> which
though some apply it to all Ministers, yet if we mark the place, it
can agree to none but the Apostles. And they meeting at Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,
concluded as it seemed good to the holy Ghost &amp; to them:
so that we see they could not erre, though they were but men.
But it is not so with the Ministers of the word, they may and do
erre often. Now S. <hi>Iohn</hi> being a faithfull Apostle, he receiued
this of Christ without errour, and so penned it.</p>
            <p>In this commaundement of Christ is a plaine diuision of this
whole booke, <hi>Write the things thou hast seene:</hi> that is, this vision I
haue offered to thee, &amp; the things thou sawest. In the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d place
he sets downe the present estate of the church. Thirdly the things
to come, that is, the future estate of the church to the end of the
world. So that this booke containeth two things in it, first, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
of the church in time present, secondly, in time to come to
the end of the world: the words of Christ make this diuision
plainly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:14859:69"/>
If it be lawfull to vse diuisions,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> then it is lawfull to set downe
rules for direction of diuiding aright: but the first is lawfull, <hi>ergo</hi>
the second. Therefore the art of reasoning and diuiding, as also
Rhetoricke is not vnlawfull, as some would haue it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The mystery of the seuen starres.</hi> Here is the third action of
Christ, which is the interpretation of the vision which he had
shewed to <hi>Iohn,</hi> and he onely interprets the principall parts of it.
Now Christ expounds this visio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to <hi>Iohn,</hi> namely, because he was
to shew himselfe to be an holy man of God, namely a Prophet.
Now the principall thing in a Prophet, is to be able to expound
visions, either his owne or any others, as we see in <hi>Daniel.</hi> Now
that he might shew himselfe to be an absolute Prophet, in this
booke Christ doth not onely shew him the vision, but the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of it: he expounds it, that <hi>Iohn</hi> might be incouraged in
penning and receiuing the things in this booke.</p>
            <p>Now Christ expounds not the whole vision, but the two
principall parts: what is meant by the seuen starres and seuen
candlestickes: namely, by the seuen starres seuen Angels of the
seuen churches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the candlestickes, we shewed before.</p>
            <p>In this verse note why Christ expounds the two principall
parts, &amp; leaues the rest vnexpounded. The reason is, first because
Christ hath giuen his church power to expound visions and scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.
Now if he had expounded euery part and circumstance,
then there had bene no matter left to the church to exercise her
power. Secondly, to stir vp to diligence &amp; study of the scripture,
both Ministers &amp; all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of the church: for if all were plaine,
then men wold be idle, neuer take paines to interpret the word:
therefore Christ expounds the chiefe, and leaues the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
and appurtenances for the church to interpret. Thirdly,
that men might dayly grow in knowledge of the Scripture: for if
all were knowne at first, they would not study to increase in
knowledge: fourthly, to stir vp inuocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for grace, to vnderstand
Scripture. Now these Ministers are called Angels, which be the
Pastors and Ministers of the church. <hi>Mat. 11. 10. Iohn</hi> Baptist is
called Christs Angel, or messenger, or Ambassadour. By this we
haue direction to expound another place of Scripture, where it
is said, <hi>Women must be couered because of the Angels:</hi> that is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:14859:70"/>
of the Ministers: for the couering of the head in the church
of Corinth was a signe of subiection and inferioritie, contrary to
our vse. Now, the women when they come into the congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
before the Ministers, they must be couered, to shew their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection
and submission to the Gospell and doctrine deliuered to
them.</p>
            <p>Seeing Ministers be called Angels,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> that is, messengers and
Ambassadors, they must behaue themselues as Ambassadors,
they must haue speciall care, first of the matter of the ambassage,
secondly of the maner, that they deliuer nothing but their Lords
mind, and in that very maner he would if he were present: and if
they deliuer any thing els, or in any other maner, they shalbe sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
of vnfaithfulnes. Now if Christ were on earth, wold he de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>liuer
his word partly in English, partly in Latin, or vse the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
of the fathers, &amp; Philosophy, or of Poets? And surely though
me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cal this the learned way of preaching, yet it is not that Christ
commaunded. Nay if this were admitted, it would bring in
Barbarisme, and expell the Gospell out of this land, and bring in
that misery which was among the Schoole-men, when all things
were brought to needlesse disputations.</p>
            <p>The third thing is the phrase Christ vseth, <hi>The seuen starres
are the seuen Angels, &amp;c.</hi> Not that they signifie the seuen An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
or the candlestickes signifie the seuen Churches, but are so.
Hence we see, that the exposition in the sacrament, <hi>This is my
body and blood,</hi> is warranted, and not to be vnderstood literally, as
the Papists hold. For as it is absurd to hold, that these were seuen
Angels indeed, because they are called so; so to hold the bread
is really transformed indeed into Christs body: but being a signe
(as it is common in Scripture) is put for the thing signified, this
<hi>bread is,</hi> that is, represents my body, &amp;c.</p>

the fourth action of Christ, whereby <hi>Iohn</hi> des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribeth

            <p>
               <hi>Vnto the Angell.</hi> This word is two waies vsed: first, it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
the Minister or Pastor of the particular Church of Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and so it is taken commonly and of the most. Secondly, it
may signifie a companie of Ministers or gouernours of the
particular Church of Ephesus:<note place="margin">Act. 20. 28.</note> as <hi>Paule</hi> biddeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> take heed

               </gap> ouerseers: shewing,
there were many Ministers of the particular Church of Ephesus.
Aud so this word <hi>Angell,</hi> may signifie the whole co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of that Church: as we see in Scripture the naming of one
man signifieth a whole multitude. God biddeth <hi>Moses</hi> send
my sonne, &amp;c. by which particular he noteth the whole bodie
of the Israelites. So thogh Antichrist be not one particular man,

and that child of perdition &amp; so it skilleth not whether
we take it for one man, or the whole multitude of gouernors.</p>
            <p>In this particular commandement are two points: first,
the intent of Christ was to write to the whole bodie of the
Church of Ephesus, yet he directeth his letter not to them all,
but to the Angell and Minister. That he intended to write to
the whole Church, it appeareth in the former Chapter,
where he is commanded to write to the Churches, and in the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:14859:71"/>
end of this, where he saith, <hi>He which hath eares let him heare,
what the Spirit writeth to the Churches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in that he directeth his Epistle to the Angell and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
he intimateth to him his dutie: first, that he must especially
labour to teach the particular contents of this Epistle to the
Church of Ephesus: secondly, that he should not onely teach,
but be a patterne and example to them of the things contained
in this Epistle. Secondly, he writeth to the Angell of the church
himselfe, because he especially doth great good or harme to the
Church. If the minister be good, there cometh much good, if
he be euill there cometh much euill, as all examples shew. Now
Christ writeth for this cause to him, that he might be diligent,
and so the cause of good, not of euill.</p>
            <p>The second point is, that Christ among all the seuen Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
writeth to the Church of Ephesus: first, which is not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it had authoritie aboue the rest, but because it was in ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
and estimation aboue the rest, and was the mother citie:
for they were all candlestickes, and all golden candlestickes:
but because it excelled, all other cities in riches and estimation;
for that he directeth his Epistle first to this Church. By which
he sheweth, that those Churches, townes, and people which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
either in riches and estimation, and other temporall gifts,
they must also excell in the graces of God. And so all men in
particular, as they excell in riches and estimation, they must
excel others in godlinesse and religion. So then, each town must
(as it excelleth other, in that it hath a greater name, greater ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
or other temporall blessings) go before other which want
them. If they excell other in these, and be inferiour in godlinesse
and religion, it is a shame for them before God and man too.</p>
            <p>The Epistle hath three parts, (as all ordinarie Epistles haue)
first, a preface: secondly, a proposition: thirdly, a conclusion.
The preface in the first verse.</p>
            <p>Now the preface or entrance is taken out of the former chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
The end and intent of it is, to draw the Church of Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
to reuerence the admonition of Christ: so that Christ pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth
not that first, but makes an entrance to prepare
them to receiue the same with reuerence, and regard his admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition.
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:14859:71"/>
The third reason which he vseth to do this, is thus fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med:
If I be he which holdeth the seuen stars in my right hand,
that is, he which by my mightie power, guide, blesse, protect, and
defend thee and thy Ministers: and if I walke in the midst of the
seuen candlestickes, that is, am alwaies present in the midst of
thy Church, to guide, blesse and protect you, then ye should
receiue and reuerence mine admonition: but the first is true, er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,
my admonition must be reuerenced and obeyed, both of the
Ministers and of the people.</p>
            <p>In this preface two things are to be learned: first, seeing
Christ repeateth that againe which he taught in the former
Chapter: he sheweth, this is a most notable point to be learned
and practised of all men: which is, that Christ he is present in his
Church, &amp; being present, by his speciall prouidence doth blesse,
guide, and protect it, both in Ministers and people. This must
we labour to learne, and to be certainely perswaded of, euen of
the speciall presence and prouidence of Christ in his Church,
in the speciall workes of the same. And without this, we cannot
haue sound religion: &amp; this standeth not in a swimming know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in the braine, but in a sure perswasion of the same in the
heart. The second thing is, that this perswasion of the speciall
presence and prouidence of Christ in his Church, is the meanes
to draw vs to all duties of our calling, seeing Christ maketh this
his reason to moue them to obey his admonition. So if we think
and perswade our selues, that Christ is present in the midst of his
Church, and withall guideth, blesseth, and protecteth the
same, we cannot but be moued to walke as <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
did, with God euen as in his presence.</p>
            <p>In this second verse is the second part of the Epistle,<note place="margin">Vers. 2.</note> which
is the proposition, which containeth the very matter and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the Epistle. This proposition hath two parts: first,
a commendation of this Church, especially of the Ministers, in
the second and third verses: secondly, a rebuke or reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
in the fourth verse. First, the commendation is in generall,
<hi>I know thy workes.</hi> Secondly, in particular, for particular duties,
in the words following.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I know thy workes.</hi> Some expound it of workes of mercie, and
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:14859:72"/>
liberalitie, but that cannot stand. But when he saith, I know thy
workes, that is, the dealings and practises of the people and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
in their callings and affaires, I know them, they are open
and not hid from me: and not onely know them, but with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
allow them: as in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paring this with the fourth verse,
where there is an opposition: Though I know thy workes, that
is, allow them, yet I find fault in some things with thee.</p>
            <p>Whereas Christ he knoweth,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> that is, approueth their works,
wayes, dealing, conuersation and liuing, this may be a remedie
against all secret and hidden sinnes. The adulterer, theefe, and
murtherer wait for the night, when they thinke none see them,
then they may as they thinke practise any sinne: so the trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
he thinking no man seeth him, changeth and counterfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
his wares, and blearing mans eye, thinketh all is well. And
the cause why there is such fraud, deceipt, guile, and iniustice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
men is, because men thinke they can do it so, as none
shall see them: they say, God regardeth and seeth not our dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.
<hi>Psal.</hi> 94. 7. But if men would consider, that though they
can bleare the eye of man, yet they cannot hide it from God,
seeing they be alwaies in his sight, this would make men make
conscience of many secret corruptions and sins in their hearts.
Whereas this knowledge is ioyned with approbation,<note place="margin">Obiction.</note> and so
Christ approueth of their workes, some may aske, How can
God approue of that which doth not satisfie his law, as the best
workes of the most holy men of God, being stained with sin, do
not?<note place="margin">Answer.</note> 
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The Gospell reuealeth to vs more then the lawe,
being the second part of the word. Now the Gospell telleth vs,
that if a man will, and vnfainedly do his indeuour, to please
God, to obey his will, if a man do this in truth, the Lord accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the will for the deed. So Christ here he approueth of their
workes proceeding from a pure will and earnest indeuour, as
perfect, taking the will for the deed.</p>
            <p>But seeing Christ approueth their workes,<note place="margin">Obiection.</note> the Papists may
argue hence thus: If God approue thus of men, then they haue
no sinne: if they haue none, then a man may fulfill the law in
this life,<note place="margin">Answer.</note> and so be iustified by works. <hi>Ans.</hi> Christ approueth not
their or our workes simply, but in part, as they be his workes,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:14859:72"/>
proceeding from his spirit in our hearts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but as they proceed
from our corrupt will, and be fruites of our flesh, he doth not. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
Christ approues them with pardon as they be pardoned,
and if they were not so approued, he could not approue them at
all. Christ sayth, <hi>I know your workes,</hi> that is, as proceeding from
my spirit, and as pardoned, hauing the guilt taken from them.</p>
            <p>Now I come to her commendation particularly, which is
especially of the Angel or minister, in whom the first thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
is this, namely <hi>labour:</hi> which is an excellent vertue, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in the Ministers painfulnesse, diligence and labour, in gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and gouerning the church ouer which they are set: and this
vertue is worthy of commendation, as 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. he which
ruleth well, is worthy of double honour. And <hi>Paul</hi> matched
and preferred himselfe before all other Apostles, in this, that he
laboured more then they all.</p>
            <p>Seeing our Sauiour Christ commends this labour of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery,<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note>
we see it is a worke of paines and diligence, if it be well
done, and not of ease and idlenesse, as men commonly esteeme
of it: else Christ would neuer commend it aboue all other works
in the ministery.</p>
            <p>Seeing Christ commends the Ministers,<note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> in being painful and
diligent in teaching and gouerning, the people must be diligent
in learning and obeying them. But men thinke, all is wel if they
come and heare the word, though they take no paines to know
and vnderstand it, they will not take paines to increase in the
knowledge of Religion. And the want of this paines and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
in the people, is the cause why the word is heard without
profit. Men bestow all paines, care and diligence in worldly
things, and yet take no paines in the principall, namely, that
which belongs to their soules health<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but if they would be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
of Christ, then they must vse diligence, take paines in
hearing, learning, and obeying the word of God.</p>
            <p>The Minister must labour to teach and to gouerne the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<hi>ergo</hi> they must labor to obey and keepe a good conscience,
and to practise religion. And as <hi>Paul</hi> laboured to keepe a good
conscience: so must all men learne to know and vnderstand the
word, and then to obey and practise the same. Secondly, Christ
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:14859:73"/>
he commends their patience in bearing the crosse, which vsually
followes the Gospell: and this is worthy commendation, seeing
it is more then many of the Prophets performed. <hi>Ierem.</hi> 20. was
exceeding impatient. <hi>Ionah</hi> being schooled in the whales belly,
yet after that, all things falling not out to his mind, he was most
impatient. But this Angel laboured, and withall ioyed in the
crosse and persecution. As he did, so must Ministers labour to
publish the Gospell: and because the crosse accompanies the
Gospell, they must be armed against persecution, with patience
they must endure all crosses, as <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 15. the good ground
brings forth frutie with patience. The practise of Religion and
patience must go together.</p>
            <p>Now Christ ioyneth these two, labouring in his calling, and
patience, together, &amp; seuereth them not: first, because before the
fal, man could do all his dutie without trouble, with ease and ioy:
but since the fall, we being corrupted can do nothing but it is a
trouble to vs; and God set this marke on our sinnes, that all our
duties should be troublesome, and our callings should haue
crosses and calamities ioyned with them. Secondly, because as
the Ministers labor to increase in the people knowledge, and to
do their duties: so the diuell labours to hinder them and to stay
them, therefore they must not onely labour, but be diligent to
striue with patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. So <hi>Paul 1. Thess.</hi> 2. he wold haue come to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
but Satan hindred him. Now as Christ ioyneth these two in the
ministery, so in all callings these must go together, both in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
callings of the church and of the common wealth. First, we
must know the duties of our callings: secondly, we must labour
in patience to practise them with diligence: and withal we must
know, that in the doing of our dutie there is also ioyned afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
therefore we must be armed with patience, to vndergo all
crosses and afflictions in our callings: we must (though afflictions
come) obey the commaundement of God, inioyning vs trauell
and labour in our callings, and rely on his promise, that he will
blesse vs in our callings, if we labour diligently and be patient in
afflictions. We must not thinke we may leaue our particular cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
because of troubles and afflictions, but we must faithfully
continue in them, and with patience endure afflictions, and then
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:14859:73"/>
Christ shall conmmend vs, which is better then all the things
in the world: his commendation is better then any man can
giue. If he commend vs, then we are happie, though all men
speake ill of vs. But if we neglect and contemne our callings, and
will not go on because of afflictions, but leaue them for want of
patience, then instead of commending, he will discommend and
disgrace vs: and then what will it help vs though all men speake
well of vs?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And thou canst not beare, &amp;c.</hi> Now followeth the third par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
worke or vertue, for which Christ commends the church
of <hi>Ephesus. And how thou canst not beare them which be wicked.</hi>
Here he commends her seueritie against wicked men, that is,
such as liued offensiuely in life or doctrine, maintained any
manifest heresie or errour. The church of Ephesus could not
beare such, but esteemed of them as a burthen which she could
not beare, but sought to be disburthened of.</p>
            <p>Hence we see,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> that it is necessary for wicked men to be seuered
from the church, and she must be purged of them. So in all
ages it was practised, the Church sought to be disburdened of
wicked men, as when <hi>Cain</hi> had slaine his brother, <hi>Genes.</hi> 4. the
Lord cast him out fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his face, that is, that place where <hi>Adam</hi> &amp;
his family assembled to worship God. So saith <hi>Ieremy,</hi> the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
must be taken away. <hi>Ier. 15. If thou wilt turne and separate the
wicked, &amp; the vile, then thou shalt be as the Lords mouth. 1. Cor.</hi> 5.
where the incestuous person must be giuen vnto Satan. All these
places proue, that wicked men which be offensiue in life or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
must be separate from the church, she must be purged of
them. It is necessary the church should be purged of these wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
men: first, because they defile the worship of God, and infect
it by their wickednesse, whereas they which worship him must
be holy as he is holy. Secondly, least the church be defiled &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
by their wicked doctrine and life, for they be as sowre
leauen which wil soone infect the whole masse of dough.</p>
            <p>By this we see a manifest and common fault in our churches,<note place="margin">Vse.</note>
wherein wicked men are not only suffered to liue, but to receiue
the sacraments, and heare the word preached, as though they
were good: yea though many of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> want knowledge, be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:14859:74"/>
of the word &amp; sacraments, many be tainted with drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and vices, which accompany that <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. But such as want
knowledge or be wicked men in life or doctrine, ought not to
be suffered to preach to the people, and receiue the sacraments:
therfore we must seek al good meanes to disburthen the church
of them. Secondly, seeing they sought to be disburthened of
them, we see Christ hath giuen his church iudicial power to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burthen
her self of wicked me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to excommunicate and cast them
out of the church, from receiuing the sacraments: she could not
beare them, but sought to be disburthened, which she would not
vnlesse Christ had giuen her power to do it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> But some hold, that wicked men must not be cast out
of the church, but must be suffered to liue in the church, and
proue it by <hi>Marke</hi> 13. 30. the tares must be alone till the end.
<hi>Answer.</hi> But here in the parable of the tares, Christ speaketh
not of the church to be purged by Magistrates, but of the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall
purging in the last day, and that not by men, but by the
Angels.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Obiect.</hi> Luke 14. 13. Christ bids them compell all in the
high wayes: now if all must be compelled, then none must be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted
and cast out of the church. <hi>Answ.</hi> Christ speaketh not of
compelling them to the sacraments, but onely to the preaching
of the word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they must come and heare that; yet this proues not
that men wicked and offensiue may not be suspended, barred,
and excommunicated in regard of the sacraments and seales of
saluation, which must be giuen to them onely which haue faith
and repentance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> Seeing wicked men must be seuered from the church,
hence a question ariseth: how farre forth a man may conuerse
with them, and keepe company with them which are offensiue
in life and doctrine?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Euill men must be considered, first, as they be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of a commonwealth, towne, or citie: secondly, as they be
members of a particular church by tolleration. Now as they be
members of a commonwealth, citie or towne, we may conuerse
with them in outward things and ciuill affaires, as buying, sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
&amp;c. we may make outward ciuill peace with them,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:14859:74"/>
though they be wicked, as <hi>Paul</hi> biddeth vs haue peace with all
men, as farre as it may stand with the honor of God and good
of the Church, and societie wherin we liue. In this ciuill societie
we may performe outward ciuill dutie of loue and ciuill courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie.
<hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 2.</p>
            <p>2 As a wicked man is a member of a particular Church, we
may liue in it with him, for we may not because of him
leaue that Church, but still liue and abide in it. So Christ though
the Iewes and their Doctors were wicked men, in life and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
hypocrites, yet he liued still among them: but so as we
seeing their wicked life, allow not of it, but be grieued with
it, as the Sodomites grieued the righteous heart of <hi>Lot.</hi> Nay, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they be admitted to the supper of the Lord by the fault
of the Minister, yet we must and may continue among them in
the Church. So did Christ, he liued among the Iewes, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
among them in eating of the Passeouer, and receiued
the Sacraments among them, though they were corrupt in life
and doctrine. And the reason is, because if thy conscience be
good, it cannot be defiled by another mans ill conscience. Yet
though we may do these things with them, yet two things are
vnlawfull: first, we must haue no priuate or familiar companie
with them. <hi>(1. Cor.</hi> 5. the tenth and eleuenth verses.) Secondly,
no speciall familiaritie. We must not barre them of generall
duties, but of speciall familiaritie onely. For by that meanes a
man doth not onely countenance their persons, but alloweth of
their sinnes.</p>
            <p>This then condemneth them which are of that nature,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> that
they can fit and frame themselues to all companies, to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
and disposition of any companie: but if there be any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
wicked in life or doctrine, we must not keepe any priuate
companie with him, shew him no speciall familiaritie, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
our selues from such, as burdens to vs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And hast examined them.</hi> This sharpe dealing of the Church
of Ephesus hath 2 parts: the first, is examination: the second, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
of the false Apostles. The first part is the discouerie
of these false Apostles. The second, the opposing of her selfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them being discouered. The discouerie of the false Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:14859:75"/>
teacheth two points: first, that God hath giuen to his
Church, and to the Ministers and members of it, speciall grace
and wisedome, an excellent gift of discerning. 1. <hi>Cor. 2. 15. 1.
Cor.</hi> 11. Spirituall men, endued with the Spirit of God, can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
of the Lords bodie and bloud, betweene bread and wine
in the Sacrament, and common bread and wine. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.
Proue your selues: shewing, that the Church and the members
thereof, haue power, and the gift of wisedome to try whether
they haue faith or not. 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. Trie the spirits. And here she
hath power to discerne of false Apostles: and by this gift the
Church of God differeth from all other societies of men: no so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie
saue the Church of God hath this gift to iudge betweene
good and bad, truth and error, true Apostles and false Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.
Secondly, we gather hence, that the Church of
God can iudge whether a Church be a true Church or not.
Some men it pleaseth to call this to question, nay, to deny that
there is any Church in England, but call it the synagogue of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
and say there is no ministerie in it, no word, no Sacraments.
Now seeing the Church of God can iudge of vs in England:
and the churches in Germanie, in Scotland, &amp; other Euangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
and reformed Churches, iudge the Church of England
a true Church: it is so, though they deny it. For we must ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
stand to the iudgement of one or many particular true chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
then of any one priuate, or of many men. Yea seeing the
church of God can iudge of false Apostles, it hath also power to
iudge of Scriptures, to iudge which books be canonicall, which
are not. And that which the church of Rome saith is false: that
the Church indeed can iudge, but as it hath authoritie from their
Church. This Church of Ephesus had this power long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Rome was in such name, nay, it was in this time of <hi>Iohn</hi> of
farre greater name then Rome, and more famous and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</p>
            <p>The second point: in what things this discouerie of false A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
consisteth: in what this iudiciall action standeth, which
God hath giuen to the Church. It standeth in two things: first,
examination of false doctrine and false teachers. Secondly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after examination. For the first, he saith, <hi>And
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:14859:75"/>
hast examined:</hi> for the second, <hi>and found them lyers.</hi> To come to
this examination, the Church of Ephesus had a gift of exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,<note place="margin">Qu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>stion.</note>
and did examine false Apostles and their doctrine. But
how may a particular Church examine a false Apostle and his
doctrine?<note place="margin">Answer.</note> To do this, the man or Church which would do it,
must first prepare themselues, and make them fit to examine: and
in this preparation must haue an humble heart and lowly spirit:
for God reuealeth not his will to proud men, such as haue high
minds in their conceit. And in this humbling of himselfe, he
must cleane renounce his owne wit and reason, and in regard of
himselfe become a foole in his owne reason, if he will be wise
in the word of God. After this preparation he must make pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to God in his spirit, that the Lord would reueale the thing
to him, and that he would open his eyes by the meanes vsed, to
iudge of truth &amp; falshood. <hi>Luk. 11. Iam.</hi> 1. 5. In the next place he
must labour throughly to know and well to conceiue of their
false doctrines: he must seek to vnderstand them, their grounds,
the differences betweene them and the truth. For it is a fowle
fault to propound a mans error, and not in that meaning he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
it or gaue it. They must further proue and trie whether
the doctrine be of God or men. To do this, he must come to the
word of God, which must be iudge in the matter, not a dumme
letter, as the Papists hold, but the true iudge in all matters, and
most sufficient. <hi>Esa. 8. 19. 20. Ioh. 5. Search the Scriptures.</hi> On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Lord must be iudge in his owne matters, he must giue
sentence, and no Angell, Saint, or man. Now this he doth in
the written word: therefore they must search whether such do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
be contained in the Scriptures, or can by necessarie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
be collected out of them. They must after all this looke
to their liues: for it is not possible that a false Apostle should lead
a good life. We must looke on his faith and repentance, and the
fruites of them: for though he may bleare the eyes of the world,
yet if his life be well sifted, it will appeare by his faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
he is but an hypocrite; and therefore <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. Christ bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
vs trie them by their fruites. A bad tree cannot bring good
fruite: but if a man trie and tast them, though they appeare beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
to the eye, yet we shall find them to be but hypocriticall.
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:14859:76"/>
and this is a iudgement of God vpon such, that they shal be des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryed
by this one marke, by their liues and conuersations.</p>
            <p>If they teach false doctrine they haue liues answerable, they
cannot but liue accordingly. There was neuer any which was a
famous hereticke in the Church, but his life was stained with
monstrous sinnes, as the historie of the Church declareth.</p>
            <p>The second part of the discouerie is, condemnation or sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
against them: for after she had examined them, &amp; finding
them not that they seemed to be, she pronounced them to be
false Apostles and lyers. Note; she calleth them lyers, vseth sharp
speeches and yet sinneth not seeing Christ commendeth her:
so Ministers to shew their hatred against vice, may vse sharpe
speeches; not to raile or taunt, but only to shew our hatred and
misliking of sinne. So <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> calleth them a generation
of vipers: Christ called <hi>Herod</hi> a Foxe, <hi>Paul</hi> the Galatians
fooles.</p>
            <p>In that she calleth them lyers,<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> it sheweth three things: first,
that they spake falsely, and deliuered that which was vntrue: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
that they sinned of knowledge: thirdly, that they did it
of malice, to hurt and deceiue the Church: for these three be
the properties of a liar.</p>
            <p>Againe, here we see that which <hi>Paul (Act. 20.)</hi> foretold by
the spirit of Prophecie to be fulfilled, that among the Ephesians
should arise lyars on them, which professed the Gospell with
them.</p>
            <p>Againe, if men in the daies of the Apostles (they being yet
aliue) durst so take on the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Apostolical authoritie, to cal the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues
Apostles and were none: no maruell if the Pope of Rome durst
sixe hundred yeares after them take this vpon him, and say, he
is <hi>Peters</hi> successor, to take on him Apostolicall power, to allow
of those bookes for canonical which are not, and to make them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
as pure Scripture which are onely Apocrypha.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And thou hast suffered.</hi> In the former words were the first
part, namely, of her seueritie, for which Christ commended the
church of Ephesus: now followeth the second part, which is, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
their discouery to oppose her self against false apostles: how,
it will appeare in the particulars. First, of the words, <hi>Thou hast
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:14859:76"/>
suffered,</hi> or as well, <hi>thou hast borne as a burthen:</hi> for the word sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth
to be pressed down vnder a great burden. These burdens
were troubles which these false apostles caused after they were
discouered: first, open iniuries and persecutions: secondly, the
spreading of damnable and hereticall doctrines. The Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall
histories report, that these false apostles were such, as <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthus,
Ebeon, Marcion,</hi> and such like.</p>
            <p>Now in these words we note,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> it is the will of God, that euen
the best church shall be troubled by false Apostles, teaching he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall
doctrine, and persecuting the church of God, and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
great burdens to the church, and that the Lord suffers for
weightie causes: first, these false apostles must be, that the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
and true imbracers of the Gospel might be stirred vp more
to embrace and loue the same: as <hi>Iude</hi> exhorts the true belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers,
<hi>To fight for their common faith;</hi> and the more religion is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
the more we should labour to maintaine it. Secondly,
that professors might be proued and tried, whether they be true
and sound or not, 1. <hi>Cor. 11. 19. There must be heresies, &amp;c.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that God may exercise his indgements on the wicked and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites,
for they be giuen vp to beleeue lies, &amp; to receiue their
false doctrine, 2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 11.</p>
            <p>Seeing the Lord suffereth his best churches to be troubled
with false Apostles,<note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> and that for most weightie causes: we must
not be offended, because we see dissensions and scismes in the
church; which proceed not by reason of the Gospell, but from
wicked, erronious and hereticall men: for the Lord will haue
such to liue in his church, to make his owne seruants to loue him
more, to trie who be sound professors, and to bring iudgement
on the wicked: these should not make vs discouraged, but more
to loue and embrace the Gospell.</p>
            <p>Now after the dealing of these false apostles, is set downe the
dealing of the church of Ephesus against them, in all things op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
her selfe against them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou hast suffered, and hast patience.</hi> That is, thou hast borne a
burden by manifold troubles and persecutions, and hast pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to beare them. <hi>Obiect.</hi> But how can troubles, persecutions,
and patience stand together? for troubles are against mens na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:14859:77"/>
and makes them fret, and be impatient against God &amp; man.
<hi>Ans.</hi> These stand together, not by nature, but by grace. <hi>Rom. 5. 4.
Tribulation brings patience.</hi> And they stand thus together: to him
which truly beleeueth in Christ, God giueth the spirit of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
sheds his loue in his heart, &amp; so in the midst of trouble giues
him a speciall tast of his mercie. And thus in the time of trouble,
they which be most troubled, are withal most patient: so trouble
and patience may be together.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And hast patience.</hi> Here is the first way, by which the church
of Ephesus opposed her self against false apostles and their dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
which were double: first, iniuries and persecutions: second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
false doctrines, heretical and damnable teaching. Now by pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
she opposed her selfe to both these. So the onely way
to oppose our selues against persecutors, such as iniury or wrong
vs, is patience: whereby we stop their mouthes, and if it be possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
ouercome and winne them to Christ. This should be our
meanes to oppose our selues against wicked men, as well in life
and maners, as in iudgement and doctrine; not to returne iniury
for iniurie, and wrong for wrong, but to haue patience; not that
we should beare their sinnes, but their wrongs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And for my names sake hast laboured.</hi> Here is the second
meanes how she opposed her selfe against their spreading of
damnable and hereticall doctrine, which is the second way how
they were a burden to her. <hi>Hast laboured:</hi> that is, taken much
paines for my name, that is, my glory, and the Gospell of Christ:
for maintaining my glory and true Religon, thou hast taken as
great paines, as they did to broach heresies: and so thou hast op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
thy selfe against them.</p>
            <p>Here then is our second way to oppose our selues against
damnable heresies of wicked men:<note place="margin">Vse.</note> we must labour to haue the
true word of God, to maintaine the glory of God and true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
Is this so? Then euery man shall labour for the name and
Religion of Christ, both minister and people; for this labour
is double, partly of the minister, partly of the people. Concerning
ministers: the ministers first labour must be, by studying and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the word, to furnish himselfe with sufficient knowledge in
the foundation and substance of the Gospel of Christ. And for
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:14859:77"/>
this cause S. Iohn (Reuelation 11.) must eate the booke, that is, by
study &amp; meditation, haue it in his hart and mind, to digest it wel.
Psal. 2. 7. the Priests lips must preserue knowledge, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
must seeke it at his mouth. Secondly, he must deliuer the
whole counsell of God, concerning the matter of saluation to
the people, and the whole doctrine of the Gospell contained in
the bookes of the Prophets and Apostles. So did <hi>Paul.</hi> Act. 20.
<hi>He kept nothing backe, but deliuered the whole counsell of God.</hi>
Thirdly, he must be able to discouer, and labour to discerne
false teachers to the people, not onely to know them, but make
the church to know them. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. he must conuince false teachers,
and then discerne and discouer them, which he shall do by two
things: first, by conuincing and discrying their erronious do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine:
secondly, by reprouing their wicked life. So Christ noteth
the erronious doctrine of the Scribes and Pharises, in their mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpreting
the law: secondly, their hypocriticall life. So <hi>Paul</hi> in
all his Epistles noteth wicked mens errours, and then their bad
life. Fourthly, he must labour that the doctrine deliuered out of
the Gospell, may edifie and take fruite in mens hearts, which is
the end of all preaching and teaching. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. Fifthly, he must
labour to be a patterne and president in his owne person, of that
doctrine which he teacheth, that so they may haue his example
to follow, which is an excellent meanes to make them obey the
word: and the neglect of it is the cause why many contemne the
word. Sixthly, he must make petition to God, that his particular
church may hold, receiue, &amp; obey that doctrine he deliuereth. So
<hi>Paul</hi> in all his Epistles praies for them, that they may receiue his
doctrine.</p>
            <p>Now as the minister,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> so the people also must labour for the
name of Christ, euery true member of the church must labour
to know &amp; vnderstand that doctrine which is deliuered out of
the word. Christ bids vs beleeue the Gospel and repent: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we must first know it, and then we must beleeue it. Then we
must do as <hi>Mary</hi> did, we must leaue other lesse matters, and sit
at Christs feete, to heare his gracious words. <hi>Luke</hi> 11. further
we must labor to haue the same knowledge conueyed to others:
for if we beleeue truly, we cannot containe our selues, but we
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:14859:78"/>
must needs teach others. He which drinketh of the well of life,
out of his belly shall flow full streames of running water, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7.
he cannot hold it in, but will conuey it to others. That this may
be done, first the head of the family, he must teach and
instruct his family: for God hath bound him in conscience to
spread abroad that knowledge he hath, to conuey it to his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
and though he be not able, yet God requireth he should be
able to instruct them, that so a particular and litle church may be
in his family. Againe, euery man must labour to win his enemy,
and those which are ignorant, to beleeue the word. The Scribes
and Pharises compasse sea and land to make one Proselite, and
the wicked labour to winne men to do as they do, much more
should we. Yea and euery man must labour to edifie those which
be fellow-members with him of the same church, in faith, hope,
loue, repentance, and such like: &amp; as <hi>Iude</hi> saith, they must labor to
saue some. Lastly, to maintaine the Religion of Christ against all
his enemies, to answer them and to stop their mouthes. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi>
3. 15.</p>
            <p>Seeing the maintaining of the name and religion of Christ is
so excellent a thing,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> we must aboue all things labour for it: to
spread it abroad ouer the whole earth, to defend it against all
false teachers. So did the church of Ephesus being persecuted
and iniured by false Apostles: and this is a most blessed labor, to
to defend Christ and his Religion, and with it the honour of
God.</p>
            <p>In the end of the verse he setteth downe the maner how she
defended it: namely, that she did not faint, but was constant, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuered
to the end. So we haue had the Gospell long time prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
we haue defended it with hazard of life &amp; goods; we must
not now leaue off, but still continue: and this exhortation is
necessary, seeing the Lord, after so long peace, purposeth to try
vs by persecution, or false teachers. Then let vs purpose to be
constant to the end, and not as some, who can change as religion
changeth, be of any religion. To maintaine religion is commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
but the principall thing for which the church of Ephesus is
commended, is perseuerance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Neuerthelesse, &amp;c.</hi> In the fourth verse Christ setteth downe a
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:14859:78"/>
direct and seuere reproofe of this Church. <hi>I haue something a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
thee.</hi> Here Christ dealeth as a iudge, calling the Church
to an accompt, laying actions to her charge: which actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is this,
<hi>Thou hast lost thy first loue:</hi> that is, the Church and people of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesus,
the Angel and the people, haue lost that loue to God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and man, which they had when they were first called: not
that they left it wholly, but because both people and Minister
suffered their first loue to decay, that now it was not so feruent
and plentifull as before.<note place="margin">Obiection.</note> 
               <hi>Ob.</hi> Christ commendeth her zeale a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
false Apostles.<note place="margin">Answer.</note> 
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It is true, she had now zeale and
loue, but in respect of that she had first it was no zeale, nay it
was cold and frozen, therfore he saith: <hi>thou hast lost thy first loue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If God had something against this Church:<note place="margin">Vse.</note> then now he may
iustly haue against all particular Churches in the world, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
against vs in this land, seeing we be in her estate. A great
part neuer had loue of Christ, and many haue fallen from their
first loue. That some haue fallen it is plaine: many in Queene
<hi>Maries</hi> time were content to liue in persecution for the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell:
but after when quietnes came, they became plaine world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
as the historie of the Church records. And in these dayes
of peace and plentie of the Gospell, such as twentie or seuen
and twentie yeares agone were zealous professors, now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
cold and frozen professors. Many I graunt are free from
this sinne, yet are they worse then these: for they neuer had the
loue of Christ and religion,<note place="margin">Mat. 24.</note> but are louers of themselues,
of this world,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 3.</note> honour, riches and pleasure. Now then if Christ
had something against these Churches for losing their loue,
much more may he haue against vs, who neuer had true loue of
him. That men now adayes be louers of themselues, of this
world, and not of Christ, it appeareth, seeing most congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Churches after this long time of hearing the Gospell
preached, being daily taught, yet are not bettered in opinion,
iudgement, life and obedience: but still remaine ignorant,
which argueth no loue of God, nor of religion. For it is not
possible that he which loueth God, and loueth religion indeed,
should continue from yeare to yeare in ignorance, neuer profit
in practise of religion, in bettering his knowledge &amp; obedience.
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:14859:79"/>
And in that men liue in their particular callings without al loue
to God and religion, it argueth they loue not God: for if they
loued God, they must needes loue their neighbours: these going
together. But men practise their callings with the loue of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
of honour, riches, and pleasure; no loue to God, no loue
to religion. This should moue vs to stirre vp our hearts to labor
to get true loue of God, of religion, and of our neighbour, that
Christ haue no action against vs. For if a King or a mightie man
shold haue an action against vs, especially being iust and good,
it would make one quake and tremble: but we haue euen the
King of heauen and earth to deale with, he hath an action a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
vs, then it is best to looke about vs. This <hi>Paule</hi> vrged to
<hi>Timothy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 16.</note> that he would go beyond himselfe, &amp; abound in feare,
loue and repentance. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 13. he laboured to that which was
before, forgetting that which was behind, that so he might
come to perfection. He looked first on his wants, and then by
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tooke occasion to grow and increase in all spirituall graces.
We are in a way, we must walke to heauen, there is no standing,
if we purpose to come to the marke: we must be as young chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
who first are children, litle in knowledge and strength, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
are stronger, and lastly become tall men: so must we daily
grow till we become tall men in Christ, perfect and tall men in
knowledge of religion. And they which after long preaching be
ignorant or make no increase in religion, they be in a dangerous
estate, and cannot possibly come to the kingdome of heauen.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hast fallen from thy first loue.</hi> Hence the Papists as also other
Churches gather, that a man may fall away wholly and finally:
then this question must be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidered whether a man may wholy
fall from grace. That we may answer to this, we must know,
grace is taken two wayes: first, for that fauour of God, whereby
it pleaseth his maiestie to make vs his children which truly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
in Christ: and this is the fountaine of all grace, loue, and
fauor. Now if grace be taken for this fauor of God in Christ, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
though the outward signs and sensible feeling of Gods fauor in
Christ may be lost; yet grace, that is, Gods fauour in Christ, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be lost. A father by some offence of his child may not shew
signes of fauour to his sonne for a time, but rather his anger by
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:14859:79"/>
words or stripes: yet for all this he carieth a fatherly mind to
him, not purposing to disinherit him. So when a true child of
God sinneth, he then feeleth not the fauour of God, for he tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
his countenance fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him for a time, yet not so that his fauor
is wholy lost, but he still keepeth it towards vs, not purposing
to disinherit vs in Christ: but is still our father, and we his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
Secondly, grace signifieth not onely Gods fauour, but the
gifts of grace, as faith, hope, repentance, &amp;c. which are bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on them which beleeue. Now these graces be of two sorts,
some necessarie to saluation, without which we cannot be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued:
for without faith no man can be iustified, sanctified, or glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified.
Now from true faith proceedeth true hope and loue,
which three graces be especially necessarie to saluation, and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peciall
graces of Gods spirit. Secondly, there are other graces
which be profitable and needfull, yet not necessarie to saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:
as feeling of Gods fauor, ioy and alacritie in inuocation of Gods
name, feare, ioy, &amp;c. and these are not so necessarie, but that
a man which hath them not may be saued. Now then the three
first, faith, hope, loue ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be lost finally or wholly, being neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie
to saluation; but the other may: faith indeed may be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened
and wounded, but neuer lost wholly, but in part and for
a time; and so it is said here of the Church of Ephesus.</p>
            <p>First, that grace cannot be lost wholly and finally, these rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
proue, <hi>Math.</hi> 16. 16. Christ promised <hi>Peter,</hi> and in him the
whole Church, that the gates of hell should neuer preuaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him: for when he saith, they shall not preuaile, the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
is, they shall shew very much strength, but shall not ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
or preuaile against the Church. Though she may be foy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
yet neuer ouercome. The second reason is, if it were possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
he should deceiue the elect of God. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 24. Christ ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
it for graunted, that they which beleeue, which are truly
iustified and sanctified, cannot fall finally, &amp; so loose their faith.
Thirdly, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. 28. Christ saith, his sheepe shall neuer perish.
But they answer: that so long as they remaine the sheepe of
Christ, they shall not perish: but Christ cutteth off that obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
saying, no man taketh them out of his hand, they shall not
be able by their naturall corruption to fall, nor any man can
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:14859:80"/>
take the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of my hands. The fourth reason, is <hi>Ioh. 3. 36. He that
beleeueth hath eternall life:</hi> they say, hopeth: but he which hath it
in hope truly, he cannot loose it, seeing hope ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not make a man
ashamed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 6. and hope is grounded on faith, <hi>Heb. 11. 1.
Rom.</hi> 8. 30. whom God predestinateth, he calleth, iustifieth, san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifieth,
and glorifieth. Now if he which beleeueth shall be iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
and glorified, then he cannot fall away: for he which falleth
finally, shall neuer be glorified. Fifthly, in the end of the chapter,
he saith, nothing can seuer him and the church of the Romanes
from the loue of Christ, <hi>ergo</hi> not fall finally: for then they may be
seuered. Sixthly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 29. Gods gifts of saluation are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
repentance, that is, the peculiar gifts of his spirit necessary to
saluation, are without repentance. They say, God for his part
repents not, but man reiects that grace whereof God repented
not: but this makes Gods will subiect to the will of his creature,
and makes man to rule God, to obey mans wil: seeing they make
mans will to rule Gods will; man wils a thing, God wils it not,
yet mans will must stand, which is absurd. A seuenth reason, 1.
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 9. he which is borne of God sinneth not, or cannot sin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the seed of Gods word is in him. Now in the first chapter
he saith, that he which saith he hath no sinne, lieth. <hi>Iohn</hi> then
meaneth here, that he which truly beleeueth, sinneth not, that is,
sin ruleth not in him with whole consent, but in part. And man
being partly flesh &amp; partly spirit, as he is regenerate, sin proceeds
not from him but as he is flesh. They answer: so long as he abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
borne of God: but when he ceaseth to be borne of God, he
sinneth then with ful consent: but he cuts of that cauil and saith,
Neither can sinne, seeing the seed of the word working by the
spirit of God, makeh him continue that he cannot so sinne.
Eighthly, If a man may fall wholly and finally, then he must
be cleane cut off from Christ: for he must first be cleane cut from
Christ, haue no coniunction with him, before he can loose grace
wholy. Now if a man should be so often cut from Christ, as he
looseth grace, then he should be often cut off, and often reuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to Christ: and if he should be so often reunited to Christ, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he should be so often baptised, for baptisme is the sacrament
of incision and ingraffing into Christ: but that is absurd, that
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:14859:80"/>
baptisme should be any more then once administred: <hi>ergo</hi> a man
is but once ingrafted, but once vnited to Christ; and so cannot
be reunited, and neuer fall. The last reason, We pray, <hi>Leade vs not
into temptation:</hi> that is, suffer not Satan and sinne wholy to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile,
and to conquer vs. Now in euery petition there are two
things, first a commaundement to pray: secondly, a promise that
we shall be heard: therfore seeing there is a promise in the word
that no true child of God shall be wholly conquered of sinne or
Satan, no true child of God can finally fall away.</p>
            <p>Against these reasons are brought diuers arguments, and they
are of three sorts: first, testimonies of scripture: secondly, exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples:
thirdly, equity. For scriptures they alleage these places. First
<hi>(Exod. 32. 33.) Moses</hi> prayeth to God that he may be blotted
out of the book of life: therfore he which is the true child of God
may perish finally. <hi>Answ.</hi> His petition must be vnderstood with
condition; if it be possible: and so Christ; let this cup passe if it be
possible: else <hi>Moses</hi> should pray for that he knew was not possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and so against his owne knowledge: for he knew it could
not be that one priuate man should die for the people, or suffer
eternal punishment for them. Againe, <hi>Moses</hi> in that petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth
principally shew his zeale and earnest loue he bare to Gods
glory and the good of the people, in that he neglected his owne
life, and desired that rather then God should want his glory, and
they perish, he should rather die (if it were possible) eternally. So
<hi>Paul</hi> desired to be accursed that the Iewes might be saued.<note place="margin">Rom. 9. 3.</note> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
they vrge, If the righteous turne from his righteousnes, he
shall die, <hi>ergo</hi> a righteous man may perish. To these words I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 9.</note>
there is a double righteousnes, one of the outward action,
another of the person: the first is, when a man keepeth the whole
law outwardly, in respect of men: the second, in that a mans per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is righteous by Christs righteousnesse before God. A man
may haue the first, and yet be an hypocrite, and so it is meant
here of the first not of the second, by which ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is in deed righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
before God. <hi>Ans.</hi> 2. It must be vnderstood of them which
esteemed themselues righteous, they pleaded that their fathers
sinned, &amp; they were punished: so that they pretended they were
iust, but were not so indeed. Another place is <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 13. there
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:14859:81"/>
be some which beleeued for a time. <hi>Ans.</hi> There are three kinds
of faith, as also of beleeuers, historicall, temporall, and true sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
faith: in the first is knowledge &amp; assent to the word, yet no
great ioy or reioycing: in the second is also ioyned ioy and reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
to the assent with approbation: but in sauing faith there is
also apprehension of the promise of God to our selues, which is
not in the other.</p>
            <p>Now as of faith, so of beleeuers there be three kinds: one,
which knoweth the word, and giueth assent to it, yet hath no
great loue or liking of it: the second, he loueth it, reioyceth in it,
but apprehendeth not the promise: but the third, he beleeueth,
loueth, and apprehendeth the promise. Now the two first may
fall away, but the last cannot fall away: and <hi>Luke</hi> is to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
of the two first, not of the last. But they obiect and say,
there is but one God, and one faith, therefore all faith is one.
<hi>Phil. 4. Answ.</hi> That is, there is but one faith, one doctrine of
saluation, and one religion: so faith is vsed in the word, and so
it must be here vnderstood. Secondly, they proue it by exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples,
as first of <hi>Adam:</hi> secondly, of <hi>Dauid. Adam</hi> he had grace suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,
yet he in his innocencie fell from God, therefore much
more we which haue not so much grace as he had. <hi>Ans.</hi> Though
he had greater measure of grace, yet we haue more certaine and
sure priuiledges of grace then he had: first, he had his grace by
creation, we by redemption, which is greater then creation: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
he had the first grace not the second: but we haue the
first grace and the second too by promise, which preserueth vs
in the first grace, <hi>Phil. 1. 6. 2. Thes.</hi> 1. The Lord is faithfull to
establish vs, &amp; to keepe vs from euill. God giueth the first grace
to beleeue and repent, and the second to make vs to continue in
the same. They obiect, <hi>Dauid</hi> fell from grace by two great sins:
one of adulterie, the other of pride. <hi>Answ.</hi> He fell grieuously,
and the graces of God were sore decayed, weakned and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in him, not cleane extinguished: for then he should haue
conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned God, his word and religion, &amp; despaired of mercie,
which he did not. This sheweth, he had the remnants of grace
in his heart still, though weakened and wounded. <hi>Ob.</hi> 1. But he
prayeth God to create in him a new heart. <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. therefore
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:14859:81"/>
he had cleane lost grace. <hi>Answ. Dauid</hi> speaketh there as he felt
himselfe, not as he was in respect of God, for he felt in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
much trouble, and Gods wrath against him. 2. <hi>Ob.</hi> But
he repented not of a whole yeare. Now, no repentance, no
pardon; and no pardon, no grace. <hi>Answ.</hi> The gift of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
was in him when he fell, and after, but the practise of it
shewed it selfe not till that time that the Prophet came to him,
he wanted not repentance simply, but new repentance in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
for that fact. Their third argument is from equitie of nature
&amp; common reason: a child of God may become the member of
an harlot, now one cannot be the member of God and of the
diuell, therefore a man may fall finally. <hi>Ans.</hi> There be three sorts
of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers, a dead, a decayed, and a liuely member: the first is as a
leg of wood or brasse: the second, as an arme or leg taken with a
palsey: the third, a mouing and liuely member, as an hand sound
and ready to moue. So in Christ there is a dead me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, which is
only in shew, not in deed: secondly a member decaied, dying but
not dead, as a man by sin taken with a spiritual palsey which can
not feele grace flowing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christ: thirdly, a liuely me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber which
feeleth and liueth in Christ. Now a liuely member of Christ, can
not be the member of an harlot: but a decaied member, which is
in the midst betweene dead and aliue, that is the member of
Christ and the member of an harlot; but being not dead but dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
shall be quickned againe: so a man is made the member
of Christ spiritually, but the member of an harlot by carnall
maner. They say further, if that men be so certaine of their sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
that they cannot fall away, then this shewes there is no
need of the word, no need of preaching and exhortation. <hi>Ans.</hi>
Though a man be certaine he cannot fall away, yet preaching
and exhorting haue their vse, not onely to worke grace, but also
to make men constant in grace, and to perseuere to the end: and
though a man be certaine of his saluation, yet he must vse the
meanes. <hi>Paul (Act. 28.)</hi> he knew that not one in the ship should
perish yet there must not one go out of the ship. <hi>Esay (38)</hi> tels
<hi>Hezechiah</hi> he should recouer, but he must vse the meanes, and so
he did. But say they, this doctrine maintaineth grosse securitie, to
teach that men are sure they cannot fall. <hi>Ans.</hi> There is a double
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:14859:82"/>
securitie, one of the flesh, when a man giues himselfe to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
and profits of this world, hauing no care or conscience of
his owne saluation: secondly, there is a securitie of faith, when
one relieth wholy on Christ in the matter of saluation. Now see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that doctrine maintaines securitie, not of the flesh, but a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
securitie of faith and peace of conscience, it is not to be
disliked, for it is a mans chiefe felicitie, when a man in life and
death relieth wholy on Christ. Thus the answer to the question,
is, that a true beleeuer cannot loose faith, nor fall away from
grace wholly or finally, but in part, and for a time.</p>
            <p>Seeing this decaying of loue was in this famous Church foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and preserued by the Apostles,<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> then much more is it rife in
our Church, seeing we haue not the like measure of grace that
they had: then we must looke to our selues, see how we decay in
loue to God, and to our neighbour; if we do, then we shall find
that after long profession we haue decaied much in loue. And if
we can excuse our selues, yet take heed of it: for seeing this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Church was subiect to it, it cannot be but we are. As we
see water which is once hot, if it be cooled, it will be more
cold, and freeze harder then that which was <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>euer warme:
so he which hath bin indued and inflamed with the loue of God
and his neighbor, and after waxeth cold, he wil be worse then he
which neuer had that heate. The Hawke while she is fit to catch
the prey, and liuely to flie well, she is set on the hand of the King
and Nobleman; but if she be old or dead, then she is cast off, or
to the dung-hill: so when we loue God and our neighbour, with
alacritie and chearefulnesse, then we are on Gods right hand, in
his fauour and loue; but if we die and decay in loue, then we are
in the ready way to be cast off, and cast away. Our loue to God is
like a litle fire or flame: then we must not quench it and cast wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
on it, for that puts it out: so our sinnes they be as water, nay e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
sin we commit it as a dish of water cast on the litle fire of
our loue, and by it we do what we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to put out the fire of Gods
grace: but we must do as the Priests did, who kept the fire on the
altar, neuer let it out, but fed it continually: so we must cherish
and preserue this fire, and carie wood to this fire dayly: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
we must stirre vp the grace of God dayly in vs, as we
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:14859:82"/>
would lift vp fire and blow it. Thirdly, that it may increase, we
must exercise the workes of faith, loue, obedience, repentane,
and godlinesse. For without these our loue to God and man,
will soone decay and waxe cold.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>Remember therefore whence thou art fallen.</hi> In these words
Christ as a faithfull Pastor of our soules, prescribeth a most soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
remedie against the former vice, namely, decay in loue.</p>
            <p>Now out of this, that Christ rebuketh not the Church of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesus,
but withall giueth a soueraigne salue for that sore, we
learne that the doctrine of the law whereby sinne is reproued, is
to be taught; but withall the Gospell must be preached, seeing
in it alone the remedie is to be had. Then must we imitate
Christ: that is, preach the law in precepts and threatnings: and
then the Gospell, seeing the law sheweth only the wound, the
Gospell the remedie.</p>
            <p>The general vse of this remedie standeth in answering to two
questions:<note place="margin">Vse.</note> the first question is: A man is called effectually to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
and to professe the Gospell: but after his conuersion, by the
diuell, the world, or his owne corruption, he sinneth and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
his conscience, how shall he recouer his owne estate? <hi>Ans.</hi>
He must <hi>remember from whence he is fallen, and do his first
works.</hi> The second question is: A man hath liued in ignorance,
after his owne lust, neuer called effectually, but now he is tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
in conscience for his wicked life, how shall such an one be
reconciled to God, and escape his iudgements? <hi>Ans.</hi> He must
(saith Christ) remember from whence he is fallen by his first fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Adam,</hi> and by his owne sinnes: secondly, he must repent of
his sinnes past: and lastly, he must do his first workes, to which
he was bound by the law of nature, and by the morall law of
God.</p>
            <p>Now in particular of the remedie. It containeth three parts:
the first, <hi>Remember whence thou art fallen:</hi> the second, <hi>And re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
and do thy first workes:</hi> and in the end is a reason to moue
them to do these duties: <hi>or else I will remoue thy candlesticke.</hi> The
first part, <hi>remember:</hi> that is, remember, examine thy selfe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly,
that thou maist see thy decay in thy loue: and after
that thinke on it often, and ponder it in thy heart. So that these
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:14859:83"/>
words inioyne them two duties: the first, to examine themselues:
the second, to consider of their estate.</p>
            <p>1 Examine: that is, enter into a diligent search of thine
owne heart, search thine owne particular wants, especially this
one want, thy decay in loue. Secondly, she must after examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
often thinke of her owne wants, and often lay them to
her owne heart.</p>
            <p>Hence we see it is a dangerous thing for any Christian,<note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note> not
to know his estate, not to be acquainted with his owne wants:
<hi>Ier.</hi> 8. he blameth the people for this sinne: none among them
said so much as <hi>What haue I done,</hi> none examined or considered
his owne estate and wants. In the dayes of <hi>Noah</hi> they knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
till the floud came on them, they neuer looked to their
owne estate, or regarded and considered Gods iudgements, or
their owne sinnes and wants. And in our time this sinne is too
common, not one of a thousand examineth his life, considereth
his owne wants and sinnes: nay, now if a man turne his eye to
see his owne sinnes, why then this is a meanes to worke me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
in a man: and so most men flie this, which is so neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie
a discipline.</p>
            <p>We see it is a speciall dutie of them which liue in the church,<note place="margin">Vse 2.</note>
to be acquainted with their owne estate, to know and often
consider their owne wants and sinnes: <hi>Zach.</hi> 2. When he begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
to preach repentance, he biddeth them <hi>search themselues,</hi>
or fanne and winnow themselues, as a man would search for a
litle thing in an heape of chaffe. Then we must search our selues
diligently and narrowly, yea the least thing in vs, as <hi>Zacharie</hi>
biddeth his auditors. And after that we find wants in our hearts,
we must consider of them seriously: for no man can repent truly
till he know his owne estate throughly: then we must often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
it, and be well acquainted with it. <hi>Psalm.</hi> 119. vers. 59. <hi>I
considered my waies:</hi> that is, I entred into my selfe, and finding
mine owne wants, then I turned me to thee.</p>
            <p>And here we see the very cause why so few repent truly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they remember not whence they be fallen, and know not
their owne estate. The second part is, <hi>Repent:</hi> first, when thou
art well acquainted with thine owne estate, &amp; knowest thy
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:14859:83"/>
wants and sinnes; then in the second place repent.</p>
            <p>In handling of this dutie, note fiue points: the first, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
is: the second, how it must be practised: the third, who
commaundeth it: the fourth, who must practise it: the fifth, for
what end. Repentance is first properly for the place of it,
in the mind of man: for it is, after some folly, ouerslip, or error,
to be better aduised, which is proper to the mind, and therfore
repentance is properly of the mind. Againe, it is a change in the
mind, as of an euill mind to become good, a turning from sinne
to grace, from all sinne to God. <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 20. Now this turning
from sinne to God standeth in a purpose and resolution, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
a man by Gods grace purposeth to turne from all sinne, to
serue the Lord and cleaue to him, in obeying his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
First then there must be a purpose in the mind, from
which proceedeth a turning of the whole man, in will, affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and action: which is the principall thing in repentance,
namely the turning of the whole man from euill actions and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
to renued affections and renued actions.</p>
            <p>By this we see, that the common description of repentance
is not good, in that they say it standeth in contrition, which
is, sorrow and remorce for sinne, which is no part of repentance,
but may be a cause of repentance: godly sorrow indeed causeth
repentance, but is nothing of the nature of it. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 9. 10.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Or else.</hi> That is, if you will not practise that remedie: to wit,
renew your former loue and repentance: <hi>I will come against thee:</hi>
or as the words be in the originall: <hi>I will come to thee shortly.</hi> The
Lord cometh to a people two waies, in mercie, or iudgement: in
mercie he cometh, when he testifieth his presence to them by
shewing mercie: as when Christ in spirit came to the old world,
and preached to them (as <hi>Peter</hi> saith) an hundred and twentie
yeares.<note place="margin">1. Pet. 3. 19.</note> Secondly, he cometh in iudgement when he testifieth
his presence in iudgement. So in the second Commaundement:
I will visite the sinnes of the fathers: that is, I will come and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
of the fathers sinnes, whether they be in their children,
and will punish them. So here if the Church of Ephesus repent
not, he will come to her, to testifie his presence in iudgement,
not mercie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:14859:84"/>
Out of this first generall threatning,<note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note> we may learne this one
thing, when any people or Church liue in any one sinne, or de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cay
in loue to God, his word and religion: he then prepareth
himselfe to come to them in iudgement. <hi>Amos</hi> 4. 12. he will
punish them, because they returned not to the Lord, but lay in
their sinnes: therefore he biddeth them prepare themselues to
meete him. This we must apply to our selues, our Church and
people: for the sinnes of the Church of Ephesus be our sinnes;
we haue decayed in our first loue, since we heard the word first,
we for the most part want loue to God and to man: and besides
these sinnes we lye in many fearefull sinnes. Atheisme now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds
in iudgement and in practise, contempt of the worship
of God, neglect and contempt of true religion, crueltie, oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and want of mercie: yet for all this, what man is it that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth
to meete the Lord? So that he may iustly say, we do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay
in loue: that, it is most true of vs, that the Lord hath bene
long coming to vs for these sinnes in iudgement, in plagues and
punishments: and so is he coming at this day, it hangeth ouer
our heads, and if we continue still in sinne, he will surely come.</p>
            <p>Thus then seeing the Lord hath bene long coming to vs, he
would haue vs to repent: if we will not, no doubt he will come
and that shortly, and remoue his Gospell, he will come in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and punishments to destroy vs.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The second threatning is more particular: <hi>I will remoue thy
candlesticke.</hi> Here he sheweth in what particular iudgement he
wil come to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: namely, to remoue her candlesticke. In the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Chapter he compareth the Church to a candlesticke: then
when he saith he will remoue the candlesticke, he meaneth his
word and Gospell: take the ministerie of the word from her,
and so make her become of a Church, no Church: and hauing
remoued the Gospell, will in stead of it, send ignorance and
blindnesse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If thou repent not:</hi> that is, if thou continue stil in thy sin. In this
second threatning note three things: first, concerning the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster:
secondly, the Church and people: thirdly, euery priuat man.
First, concerning the minister, if he decay in loue to God, his
word and religion, if he continue and lie in his sinnes, or any one
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:14859:84"/>
sinne, that is a meanes to depriue him of his office and calling,
and of his gifts (for this is especially directed to the Angell) <hi>Ier.
15. end.</hi> The Prophet failing in his dutie, partly by feare, partly
by want of patience: then the Lord he becomes a Prophet to <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy,</hi>
tels him, that vnlesse he returne to the Lord and repent, the
Lord would make him no Prophet: so that in him he speakes to
all Ministers, that if they would haue their callings and gifts to
remaine, they must not liue in any one sin, decay in loue to God
or religion, for then their callings and gifts shall be taken from
them. As repentance is necessary for all men, so especially
for Ministers, they must especially renew it, seeing that is the
onely meanes to continue their callings and gifts. The second
thing is, concerning a church or people: if any church or people
decay in loue to God or his word: or lie in any one sin, they then
procure the Lord to remoue his candlesticke, to take from them
his word, the Gospel and true religion. <hi>Ose. 9. 7. The Prophet is a
foole, the man of spirits is mad:</hi> a heauy iudgement, whereof comes
this? He saith, for the sins of the people the Prophet, is ignorant,
and becometh mad. If this be so, then we haue all cause to
feare, that our sinnes haue deserued the Gospell should be taken
from vs: for in most men there is great decay in loue, seeing
religion is hated and contemned of most men. Therfore we must
needs feare, and the Lord for this must needs remoue his word,
take his Gospell away, if we meet him not with repentance, for
he in iustice giues men to beleeue lies, when as they will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
his truth and Gospell, being so long among them. Our
dutie then is to seeke to preuent this iudgement, by hearty and
true repentance. The third point, concernes euery priuate man:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
euery priuat Christian, now a daies decayeth in loue to God and
man, lieth in some one sinne or other, &amp;c. Now these are the
meanes to depriue him of the light of the Gospell, and his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
gifts. For as a mans loue decayeth, his knowledge de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayeth,
and so the Gospell and the loue to it wax cold. In a clock
if the watch stand, all the wheeles stand, if it go softly or swiftly,
the rest of the wheeles go accordingly: so if our loue be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased,
our knowledge is so, if our loue decay our knowledge,
our vnderstanding in religion decayeth. And this is the cause of
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:14859:85"/>
so litle knowledge especially in auncient folke, because they
loose their loue. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 12. First, we are deceiued by sin: second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
our heart is hardened: thirdly, we call into question religion,
4. we set our selues against religion, and so fal from it, so that, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay
in grace is the first cause of apostacy. Then if we would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
in knowledge and religion, we must seeke to be cleansed
from sinne, not liue and die in any one sinne, neither decay in
loue, knowledge, or affection to religion.</p>
            <p>Some gather hence that a man may fall finally and wholly:
for if a whole church may, much more one man: but the reason
is not good, for there is great difference between one man and a
whole church, for a church stands of a mixt company good and
bad, sheepe and goates, corne and chaffe, wheat and tares. Now
in the Church the wicked may fall and become false professors,
as inded these were, and yet the true beleeuers remaine stil. Now
hence it followeth not, that a priuate man truly conuerted may
fall.</p>
            <p>Now followeth the condition of both the threatnings, <hi>Except
you amend:</hi> that is, I come in iudgement to you; and take away the
Gospell vnlesse you repent. Now we must marke that all threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
in the old testament are with condition. So in <hi>Ionah, Yet
fortie dayes and Niniue shall perish,</hi> that is, vnlesse they repent: and
so are the threatnings in the new Testament with the same
condition.</p>
            <p>The wil of God, or his good pleasure, is one alone, &amp; no more,
what distinction soeuer men vse. Now his will is partly secret,
&amp; partly reuealed: his secret will is of those things which he hath
not reuealed in his word, or by any work and experience to man:
reuealed, is of those things he hath reuealed in his word, or else
taught men by experience or euent. Now the reuealed will is
with condition alway: but the secret will is not, but by it he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
all things, good things absolutely, and permitteth euill.
And to make this will subiect to condition, were to bind God
to his creature, but his reuealed will is with condition, as here in
this place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> Why doth God giue his reuealed will with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition?
<hi>Answ.</hi> Because he reuealeth in mercie so much to man
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:14859:85"/>
as is necessary to saluation, and no more: and therefore he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealeth
it in that maner as may be most fit for his saluation. Now
when he propounds his will with condition, that is best, for it
keepes men more in awe, and seemes better for their saluation
then if it were with without condition.</p>
            <p>Now marke, Christ he repeates this condition in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and end of this verse, that he will come to them, and he wil
punish them vnlesse they repent and amend. The reason
is, to shew that when men lie in sinne, or decay to God and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
then it is most necessary to repent: and it is so necessarie
that there is no other way to stay God from remouing the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
then repentance. Is this true? then it stands vs in hand, euerie
man in his owne person, and in his familie, and in the Church
publikely, to meet him with repentance: and so we must thinke
of it, in that Christ doubles the condition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But this thou hast that thou hatest the workes of the Nicolai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vers. 6.</note>
In these words is a second reason, to proue that (in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
verse) for which Christ commended her, that she could
not abide them which were euill: first, because she exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
them which receiue false teachers: secondly, she hated
their workes. To come to the words, Nicolaitanes were a sect of
heretickes, who held opinion, first that fornication and adulterie
were no sinnes: secondly, that a man might keep companie with
idolaters in sacrificing in the temple: and according to these two
opinions, they practised fornication, adulterie and idolatrie.
These were so called of one <hi>Nicolas,</hi> chosen of the Apostles to
be a Deacon, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. who for a while professed the Gospell, but
after fell away, and became head and chiefe of this sect of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But:</hi> this note sheweth that these words haue reference to the
words of rebuke before, as if he should say, though this decay
of loue be thy fault, yet I commend thee for this one ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>Here note our dutie, we must not (which is a common sinne)
be so readie to blase our brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s faults, to speake of them, paint
them out in their colours as we are: but we should as well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
their vertues, and not obscure them: for Christ, though he
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:14859:86"/>
found fault, yet finding this vertue commends her, so should
we.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou hatest.</hi> Here note this point: that it is not sufficient
for a man to haue good gifts and graces, for he may haue them
and be no member of Christ, but be in danger to be cut off from
Christ. So was <hi>Iehu,</hi> he had great zeale. So <hi>Iudas</hi> had many good
gifts no doubt being an Apostle, yet fell from Christ. So the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesians
had an hatred of the sins of the Nicolaitans, yet were in
danger to be cut off from Christ. Then we must labour for that
which is the maine point of all, which if we haue, we cannot fal,
which is, true, heartie, and vnfained repentance, daily and rene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
repentance, for daily and new sinnes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou hatest the workes.</hi> Here see our dutie, we must labour to
know the sinnes and heresies of our times, and when we know
them, we must hate them; for which Christ commends them, and
and will commend vs if we do the like.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The workes of the Nicolaitanes:</hi> not their persons. So then we
must moderate our hatred, it must be for the sinnes of men: we
must hate their sinnes, not their persons, whether they be friends
or foes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> But <hi>Dauid</hi> he hated mens persons, he prayed for the
destruction of his enemies, both soule and body. <hi>Answ.</hi> He did
it being an extraordinary Prophet, and it was no doubt reuealed
to him, that his enemies were obstinate, and would not repent,
and so prophecieth by speciall and extraordinary instinct:
for euery imprecation in the scripture is as a prophecie. But we
which want that extraordinary instinct, must keep vs within this
compasse, that we hate onely their sinnes, and not their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The workes of the Nicolaitanes:</hi> in whom note the ioyning of
two sinnes together, adultery and idolatrie; for adultery is the
punishment of idolatry, and idolatrie is the punishment of adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie:
the one being carnal fornication, the other spiritual, and the
punishment of adulterie: and so in all hereticall churches the
Lord he sends these together in iudgement, to punish spirituall
adultery with temporall fornication. If a church become idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous,
then he giues them ouer to commit fornication and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannesse.
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:14859:86"/>
So among the Israelites, and in the Romish church
falling to idolatrie, they abound also with adulterie and forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou hatest their workes.</hi> Here we may learne one lesson, for
we see many men seeing such diuersitie of opinion in matters
of religion, they will be of no church, they will be of no religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
But seeing in the best Churches planted and guided by the
Apostles, euen in their dayes, there were such heresies, as these
Nicolaitans held, no maruell if there be schismes and heresies
in our dayes: yet these should not make vs leaue the church, but
seeke to be of the true religion, and stand faster to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Which I also hate.</hi> Christ hauing now commended her, would
haue her to go on: and to encourage her therin, he setteth his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
for them to follow: thou hatest their workes, that is well
done, do so still: for so do I. And here we see Christ requireth
that we should be of the same mind, iudgement, will, and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
that he is of: and there is good cause why we should, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he is the head, we the members; we are bone of his bone,
flesh of his flesh. Now then we must see that there be a confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
betweene the head and the members, we must hate that he
hateth, loue that he loueth, &amp; so shew that we be true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
and members of Christ. <hi>Ob.</hi> Christ he hateth wicked men,
why then suffereth he them to liue, &amp; destroyeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not, or take
them out of his Church? <hi>Answ.</hi> He suffereth them for iust
cause: for he can bring good out of euill, light out of darknesse,
he can turne that which is most wicked in it selfe to his glorie,
and the benefite of his Church and children, and the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his enemies. Then no maruel though he suffer them which
he hateth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let him which hath an eare heare what the Spirit saith, &amp;c.</hi>
In this verse Christ inferreth this conclusion vpon the former
words. It containeth in it two parts: the first, a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement:
the second, a promise. A co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement: <hi>Let him that hath ears,
&amp;c.</hi> A promise, in the end of the verse: <hi>For to him will I giue of the
tree, &amp;c.</hi> and this conclusion serueth to stirre vp the Church of
Ephesus, to consider of the former things Christ taught her.</p>
            <p>In the commandement is three things: the first, who be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:14859:87"/>
               <hi>He which hath an eare:</hi> secondly, what is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:
namely, to <hi>heare:</hi> thirdly, the thing which must be heard:
<hi>What the Spirit saith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The parties commaunded to heare are described; they which
haue an eare: that is, which can heare. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. Christ expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
it, he which hath an eare to heare: that is, an hearing eare:
he must heare, and giue attention to the word.</p>
            <p>By this we see, there be two kinds of hearers: one is a deafe
hearer, not hauing an hearing eare; as those which bring out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d
and bodily eares to the word, but not the eares of the hart:
for their hearts are not affected with the word, they cannot o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
that they heare. Secondly, there is an hearing hearer, who
not onely heareth with the outward eare of the bodie, but he
hath his heart pierced and touched, hath new eares made by
Gods spirit: this is he which bringeth both the eares, his head,
and heart to the word, who is affected with it, applyeth it to his
owne heart, and beleeueth the word heard. Such an eare had
<hi>Dauid:</hi> the Lord God bored his eare, and made him new ears, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
ears of heart: <hi>Mine ears hast thou opened.</hi> And when the Lord
spake to him: hauing new eares, he answereth the Lord, Lo I
come,<note place="margin">Esa. 6.</note> his heart heard the Lord. Such eares had <hi>Isaiah, Send me.</hi>
Such had <hi>Lydia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 17.</note> her eares were opened, and she became atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
to <hi>Paules</hi> words: the Lord gaue her new eares.</p>
            <p>Seeing Christ maketh this distinction of hearers on earth,
then grace is not vniuersall: sauing grace is not giuen to
euery particular man, that he, if he will, may heare and
haue saluation: for there must be some deafe hearers as well as
hearing hearers. Then all cannot heare, nor haue eternall life,
seeing all cannot come to faith and repentance by hearing. Nay
though God admit all into the Church, yet he giueth not grace
to euery one to heare, so that he becometh a profitable hearer,
to beleeue and repent by hearing. <hi>Mat. 13. It is giuen to you to
know,</hi> not to others: noting that some onely haue the spirit of
God to heare, to know his will, and become obedient to the
same.</p>
            <p>Seeing the commandement is giuen to hearing hearers, we
must labour to become such, to become good hearers, not to
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:14859:87"/>
bring onely the eares of the bodie to the word: but the eares of
the heart, not onely eares of our bodie which we haue by crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
but the eares of our soules which we haue by regeneration:
and neuer thinke our selues well, till we <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> that hearing of the
heart, to beleeue and obey that we heare, &amp; can affect the same,
and be changed and turned by it. <hi>Iosiah</hi> heard the law, and that
not with bodily eares, but with his heart, so that he turned to
the Lord accordingly. <hi>Dauid (Psalm. 26.)</hi> God biddeth him
seeke him: he hauing his eares bored anew, maketh answer:
Lord, I will seeke thy face. Take heed then of deafe eares, when
we heare the word daily, not profiting by it, are not changed
in life: for this deafe eare is a fearefull iudgement of God, that
men hearing, should not heare nor obey, and be bettered by
that they heare. And yet this is our common hearing: for the
most part we come, bring our bodily eare to the word, but our
hearts hearken not, they obey not that we heare: but we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
as blind and ignorant, and as full of sinne as euer, and
that after long hearing. Which sheweth we are indeed deafe
hearers.</p>
            <p>The second point is the dutie commanded: namely, to heare.
Hearing in the word of God, is not onely listening with the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
eares, but to be attentiue to the word, and with attention
to adde faith, repentance, conuersion and obedience to it: for
we if we be good hearers, then we must heare so as we be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
from the corruption of the old man, and learne to beleeue
in Christ. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 21. and as much as we practise and obey, so
much we learne: for we heare no further then we obey. Then
seeing we must so heare the word, we must suffer our selues to
be chaunged and altered, labour to obey the word, and to be
changed by it. And except we thus heare, the word is not to
vs the sauor of life, but of death: and as the good hearing is the
readie means to saluation, so the deafe hearing, is to destructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
            <p>The third point which is commaunded by God: namely, <hi>that
which the Spirit speaketh.</hi> The thing which we must heare
with attention, faith &amp; obedience, is repentance for our wants
and sinnes: for of that Christ spake afore. Then this is a most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie
thing, for men to consider their owne wants and sinnes,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:14859:88"/>
and the iudgement of God for them: for else Christ would not
haue added these words, for the conclusion of the Epistle: who
hauing shewed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their wants, and the remedie, and the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God for <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> sinnes, he addeth this caueat, which
sheweth the necessitie of these things.</p>
            <p>Then it standeth vs vpon to consider our own personal wants,<note place="margin">Vse.</note>
our sinnes, and the wrath of God against them: for, the omitting
of this dutie is the bringing of Gods iudgement vpon vs; and
the practise of it is the preuenting and turning away of Gods
iudgements. And as priuate men of their personall sinnes, so
must countries &amp; cities in generall, reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber their wants, &amp; sins,
and do their first workes. In the end of the verse, are two reasons
to moue them to heare: the first, because the things spoken,
are spoken by the Spirit, that is, the holy Ghost, the third per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in Trinitie: the second, because he speaketh not to one or
two, but to all the Churches in one. <hi>Ob.</hi> But how can the Spirit
speake these words, seeing Christ speaketh them? <hi>Ans.</hi> Both
may stand: for all outward actions of the persons in Trinitie are
common to them all: and seeing this, to teach the Church, is
an outward action, it belongeth to all three: and that the Father
doth, the Sonne doth; and what the Sonne doth, the
holy Ghost and the Father do, in outward actions. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
Christ after his ascension teacheth not bodily, but by
his spirit: for Christ being at his Fathers right hand, sendeth his
comforter to leade vs into all truth. Now seeing the holy Ghost
speaks in the Scripture, &amp; he teacheth vs, we see how the church
of Rome sinneth, in that they will haue a iudge which must
speake: for Christ he being in heauen, and the Scriptures being
not able to speake, but are as a dumme iudge: therefore the
Church, that is, men in the Church, they must be iudge of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
But we see that the holy Ghost speaketh in the Scriptures,
and Christ he is iudge alone of them. The Church is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
onely, and cannot giue sentence of them, but they be
of themselues sufficient to take away any doubt whatsoeuer.</p>
            <p>2 Faith is no part of repentance, but a cause of it: for they be
2 distinct parts of Christianity: the first, a sermon, <hi>beleeue</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,</hi>
where repentance followeth faith, as a fruite of it. Thirdly,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:14859:88"/>
obedience is no part of repentance, but a cause thereof: <hi>ergo</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
stands not in these three properties: neither is all one
with regeneratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for this goeth before them: for godly sorrow is
the cause of repentance, but regeneration is before godly sorow,
<hi>ergo</hi> before repentance too. The second point is, how we must
practise repentance: this stands in two things: first true humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
secondly, true reformation of life. Humiliation stands in
confessing our sins, miseries and wants, and in condemning our
selues for them, and in harty praier to God for pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is the changing of our bad actions to good, and if need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
to make satisfaction to men. <hi>Dauid</hi> (Psal. 32.) first hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
himselfe, secondly he prayed for pardon, and withall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth
reformation of life. <hi>Manasses</hi> fel from God, but he prayed
to God, &amp; humbled himselfe. 2. <hi>Cron.</hi> 33. 12. So the prodigal son.
And <hi>Dauid</hi> in all these Psalmes of repentance humbles himself.
Psal. 32. 38. 51. 130. 143. 77. And so must we do, if we truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.</p>
            <p>Then we see the da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nable doctrine of the Papists, which make
repentance stand in contrition, and confession of sins to a Priest,
satisfaction: for a man may do all these, and yet be a reprobate. So
did <hi>Iudas,</hi> he had contrition, confessed his sinne, made satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and yet his repentance was not true repentance. Another a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse
is, that they make contrition a part of repentance, which is
indeed no grace, but may be a cause of grace. Besides, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
all sinnes to a priest, is a gibbet to a mans conscience, and
more then God himselfe requireth. Last of all, to teach that a
man must satisfie Gods iustice, is to ouerthrow the satisfaction
of Christ.</p>
            <p>The third point is, Who commaunds this? It is Christ. Now
some out of these words gather, that God giueth sufficient grace
to euery man, to repent if they will: for (say they) if he command
repentance, and yet some cannot, then he but mockes them,
and it is as if we should bid one, bound hand and foot, to rise and
walke. <hi>Ans.</hi> The Lord giueth not that commaundement to euery
particular man, but to the Church, or to some people which shal
become a Church; and then he doth it to gather the elect. Now
in the Church there be elect and reprobate: now this comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:14859:89"/>
to repent, is giuen to the elect directly, but to the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
by consequence, as they be among the elect in the church.
And this commaundement is giuen to both, for diuers ends: first
to the elect, to shew them what they ought to do, not their abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
what they can do: secondly, that it may be an outward means
to bring them to repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance: for when he giueth them this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
he is present by his spirit. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 12. he bids them
work out their saluation: but addeth, God giueth the will &amp; the
deed: shewing that God giuing that commandement, is present
by his spirit, to worke in them abilitie to performe it. Now the
wicked being in the Church haue the same commaundement,
not directly, neither to those ends, but first to keepe them in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ciuill order, secondly to make them without excuse. But
whereas they reason thus: If Christ command all to repent, then
all haue sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t grace to repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: but the first is true, <hi>ergo. Ans.</hi> The
first part is false, vnles it be restrained thus, if he command to this
very end, that they should repent and practise it: for he giueth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
to some, not that they may do it, but as to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi>
to harden their harts. For the second part, that he giueth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
to all; the meaning is, he giueth it onely to the elect
directly, because he giueth them his spirit to obey it, but to the
wicked by consequence, as they be mingled in the Church with
his owne children.</p>
            <p>The fourth point is, who must repent, namely, the Angel and
whole Church of Ephesus. <hi>Ob.</hi> But they had repented before,
how then doth he bid the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> repent againe? <hi>Ans.</hi> There are two de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: one is the beginning, the other is the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it. In the practise of which two, stands the whole life of a
Christian: first, to begin to repent when he is truly called: and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
in continuing and renuing it dayly as he often falleth. If
we haue begun by Gods grace, we must not stay there, but go on
and be renued euery day. There is no man but he shall see in him
selfe daily new sins, slips, and wants, for which he must haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
repentance.</p>
            <p>Then seeing we daily increase our sins,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> we must take heed we
lie not or continue in sin, without this repentance: for we are not
so much conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned for sin, as for lying in sin: this, if a man repent,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:14859:89"/>
brings not condemation, but lying in sin doth: then aboue all
things take heed of this, &amp; let vs daily labor to know our sins, to
be acquainted with our wants, to humble our selues &amp; pray for
pardon. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20. I beseech you (saith <hi>Paul)</hi> be reconciled to
God: they were reconciled before, for they were iustified and
sanctified: but he would haue them to labour to be more assured
of their iustification, and to haue a more full and sensible feeling
of it, and that because their apprehension by reason of their
weaknes is but sin all. The like must be had of vs.</p>
            <p>The fift point, is why or for what cause, namely, for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay
in loue especially, and other wants: Christ prescribeth to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
repentance, not that they had none at all. And so Christ prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
to vs by his Ministers, to repent of this decay in loue: if we
haue had loue and feele it now decayed, we must repent: if we
haue not, then we must labour to haue it. And Christ (we see) gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
a large commaundement, not for drunkennesse, whoore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
theft, or such grosse sins; but euen for their decay in loue,
want of knowledge, faith, feare, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The common people be of the Pharisies and Iusticiaries mind,
that they need no repentance, seeing they liue ciuilly, not tainted
with horrible and grosse sins: but we must repent for other sins,
as want of knowledge, loue, obedience, &amp;c, otherwise we cannot
truly repent. Now if we must repent of al sins, much more of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
sins, as of Atheisme, which now abounds and spreads a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade:
of pride in apparell, contempt of the Gospell, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth
in all places: for want of mercie, for crueltie, and for
those sinnes which can sooner remoue the candlesticke from
vs.</p>
            <p>Now the remedie is, <hi>to do their first workes,</hi> to returne to their
first loue, to God, his word, and to man. This is in the last place,
seeing this repentance neuer perisheth or decayeth, but must be
euer renewed.</p>
            <p>So then he would haue vs also to remember what good
thoughts, affections, &amp; actions we haue had, to get them againe,
and neuer loose them after. We must remember to do our first
workes, which the Lord graunted to vs at our first calling, them
we must labour to do againe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:14859:90"/>
               <hi>Or else I will come against thee shortly.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verse 5.</note> Whenas our Sauiour
Christ had rebuked the church of Ephesus for decay in loue, and
set downe the remedy, first to remember whence she was fallen,
secondly to repent, thirdly to do her first works: in these words
he layeth downe a reason to moue her to vse the remedie, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
to repent; if she will not, then he will come against her
shortly. This containeth three parts: first a generall threatning or
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>minatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; or els I wil come to thee: secondly, a particular threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and will remoue thy candlesticke: thirdly, a condition of
the two threatnings, except you repent. Because he speaketh to
all Churches, this shewes our dutie in reading or hearing the
word, that we apply all that is spoken, of one man, or to one
Church, to our selues: when we see any vertues commended, we
must imitate them, or vices discommended, we must search our
selues whether we be cleane of them.</p>
            <p>The promise, <hi>To him which ouercommeth, &amp;c.</hi> hath two parts,
first to whom it is made, namely, <hi>to him which ouercommeth:</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
what is promised, <hi>I will giue him of the tree of life,</hi> namely
eternall happinesse.</p>
            <p>The partie to whom, is he which preuaileth against all his
spirituall enemies, the diuell, the world, hell, death, and his owne
flesh.</p>
            <p>That we may ouercome these, three things are necessary: first
a man must be borne anew, become a new creature in Christ. 1.
<hi>Iohn.</hi> 5. for when a man is borne anew, he is free from sinne,
and ouercommeth all his enemies. Secondly, he must haue true
faith, by vertue whereof he must deny himselfe, and wholy rely
on Christ, 1. <hi>Iohn 5. We ouercome the world by our faith:</hi> for he
which truly beleeueth in Christ, he is partaker of Christ, of his
victory ouer death, hell, sinne and the diuell, and hath his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
corruption abolished and weakned. Thirdly, that we stand
against all our enemies with faith and good conscience to the
end. And he which hath these three, he is able to resist al these his
enemies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To them which ouercome. Ergo</hi> it is false, that the promise of
the Gospell belongs to all men without exception, that God
offereth life and saluation to all, vnlesse they will reiect it: for sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:14859:90"/>
is promised onely vnto them which are borne anew,
which haue faith in Christ, denying themselues, and they which
stand out against all their enemies, by faith and good conscience
to the end of their dayes. Is this so? is the promise made onely
to conquerers? we must then labour to be conquerers, to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
all our spirituall enemies: but to liue in sinne, to be the
seruants of Satan, that is, slauerie and hell it selfe: and for a man
to say in truth of heart, that he hath ouercome all these his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
this is freedome and happinesse. And though a man be
neuer so great among men, yet if he be the vassal of sinne an Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
he is out of the fauour of God, and most miserable. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the thing promised, is life eternall, which is set out by two
circumstances: first, by the cause of it: <hi>I will giue:</hi> secondly, what,
<hi>to eate of the tree of life.</hi> In which words is an opposition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
<hi>Adam</hi> and Christ: for <hi>Adam</hi> by his sinne depriued
himselfe of the tree of life, but Christ hath set open the tree of
life, that we may haue free accesse to it. <hi>Adam</hi> he lost an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
paradise, Christ hath prepared an heauenly paradise. The tree
of life stood in the midst of the garden, whereof <hi>Adam</hi> did eate.
It was called the tree of life, first, because it was a sacrament, that
is, a signe and pledge to him of eternall life, if he had continued
in his estate. Secondly, because this tree had a vertue in it from
God, to preserue <hi>Adam</hi> for euer from death and old age, and to
make him continually to liue, if he stood. This tree of life was
a true figure of Christ the Redeemer and Sauiour: for as that
tree had vertue in it from God to preserue <hi>Adams</hi> life, so that he
should haue liued for euer, and be kept from old age: so Christ
Iesus the Mediator and Redeemer, he liueth, not onely as he is
God, but as he is man, and not for himselfe alone, but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey
quickening vertue to all which beleeue in him, and are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of his merits by a true faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To eate of the tree.</hi> To eate signifieth sometime to beleeue, as
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 50. but it cannot be so here, seeing we cannot in heauen
beleeue in Christ: but to eate of that tree, is to haue immediate
fellowship and communion in heauen with Christ for euer. For
Christ shall be to vs a tree of eternall life for euer, yea all in all
to euery one of vs. In this first point of the promise, note two
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:14859:91"/>
things: the first, wherein consisteth eternall life, namely, in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediat
fellowship &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion with Christ in heauen for euer:
and this is our true felicitie, to eate of the tree of life, to partake
with Christ in heauen, who shall be to his all in all, that is, all
happinesse that heart can wish. Therefore it standeth not in
outward meanes, as meate drinke, apparell, sleepe, respiration,
recreation, &amp;c. but in the eating of the tree of life, that is, in the
immediate fellowship with Christ Iesus for euer.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the place of this tree is, the <hi>midst of paradise:</hi> where
Christ putteth a difference between the tree of life in the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
paradise, and this in the heauenly paradise. He saith in <hi>para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise,</hi>
that is, in the third or highest heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, a place of ioy and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
where the Lord especially sheweth his glorie, and where
he prouideth happinesse for his children. There are indeed three
heauens: one where we liue and breath, and where the clouds
be: the second, where the starres be: the third is the place where
the Lord sheweth his presence, and where he will haue his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
be. Of this <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh, when he was rapt vp to the third
heauen, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. It is called Paradise, because it is a place
of pleasure, for so the word signifieth. <hi>Of God:</hi> that is, most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,
and most infinite. For so <hi>Gen. 30. 8. Rahell</hi> wrestled
with <hi>Leah</hi> with wrestlings of God, that is, excellent or great
wrestlings. So in the Psalmes, to shew how huge and high the
hilles were, <hi>Dauid</hi> calleth them the hilles of God, the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
of God, that is, excellent or huge mountaines. So here
he calleth it the paradise of God, to shew, it is a place most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,
full of pleasure and ioy. This place is set out at large,
<hi>Reu.</hi> 22.</p>
            <p>Then seeing this is so excellent a place, we should labour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
all things to come thither, to weane our minds from earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
paradise, which is but a prison, and lift our heads vp to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
set our hearts and minds on things aboue. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. Vers. 8.</p>
            <q> And to the Angell of the Church of Smyrna, write.</q>
            <p>From this eighth verse to the twelfth, is the second Epistle or
letter, to another Church of Asia, namely, to the Church of
Smyrna. And before this second Epistle, is a second particular
commandement to <hi>Iohn</hi> for the writing of it, in these words,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:14859:91"/>
               <hi>And to the Angell of the Church of Smyrna, write:</hi> which parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
commaundement is prefixed before the Epistle, to assure
them and euery Church, that <hi>S. Iohn</hi> had sufficient calling to
write the same, and that he did it not of himselfe. And so should
all they which come to speake or write the word of God, haue a
sufficient calling, that so the Church may receiue their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and without doubt beleeue the same as the true word of
God. So the Ministers of the Gospell must haue their calling: for
if the Apostles of Christ, which were of more excellent gifts had
it, then, such which be but ordinarie men. This commandement
and the meaning of it, is in the first verse of this Chapter.</p>
            <p>After the particular commandement is the Epistle it selfe,
standing of three parts: first, a Preface: secondly, a Proposition:
thirdly, a Conclusion. The preface or entrance is in the eighth
verse, and containeth a preparation to the matter of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
to be deliuered. In the preface he sheweth in whose name it
is to be deliuered: namely, in Christs: <hi>He which is, and was, which
is the first and last.</hi> This he doth for two causes: first, to stirre the
Church of Smyrna to a religious care, and receiuing of the same
as the pure word of God: secondly, because no commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
concerning religion and Gods seruice, is to be propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the name of any creature, but onely in the name of God
and Christ. Now this Epistle being concerning religion and
Gods worship, he propoundeth it in Christ his name alone. And
Christ in this preface is described by two notable arguments:
first, that he is first and last: secondly, that he was dead but is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue:
but these words are expounded in the first Chapter, where
he saith, he is first and last, that is, he is euerlasting God, which
hath neither beginning nor end, afore all creatures &amp; after all.
He was dead but now liueth, that is, being God, tooke vpon
him our nature, became subiect to death, and rose to giue euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
life to vs. In which words note two points of doctrine:
first,<note place="margin">Dictrine 1.</note> that Christ is a person consisting of two natures: namely,
his Godhead and manhood: for as he is said to be first and
last, he must be God: and as he was dead but now is aliue, he is
man: and as the bodie and soule make one man, so the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
and manhood of Christ, concurre to make one Christ. The
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:14859:92"/>
second point of doctrine is a comfort, or the foundation of all
ioy and comfort to the Church of God: first, that he is God,
<hi>ergo</hi> he is able: secondly, he is man, <hi>ergo</hi> he is willing to helpe, to
deliuer his Church from all miseries, or else ease them: for he is
first and last, <hi>ergo</hi> true God, <hi>ergo</hi> able to helpe: Secondly, he was
dead but liueth, therefore willing (seeing he came to take our
nature vpon him) to be subiect to death, and to rise againe to
giue to vs eternall life. So then, this is the scope and end of these
words, to comfort the Church in miserie: and hence is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
fountaine of all comfort in this life. If the Lord lay any crosse
on thee, as persecution, tribulation, miserie or calamitie, then
consider these two things: Christ is God able to helpe, he is man
willing to deliuer thee. And this may be a proppe to stay and
hold vs vp, that we sinke not in persecutions or crosses.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I know thy works.</hi> After the Preface, followeth the Epistle it
selfe, containing the matter and contents to be deliuered to the
Church of Smyrna, in the ninth and tenth verses. The Epistle
hath two parts: first, a commendation of the Church: secondly,
counsell for her concerning time to come. The commendation
is in the ninth verse, <hi>I know thy workes.</hi> In these words as there is
a commendation of her, there is also a comfort: for he doth
not onely commend her, but comfort her being in miserie. <hi>I
know thy workes.</hi> We heard these words before expounded: I
know, that is, I see thy workes, wayes, dealing, the course and
tenour of thy life, I know and approue of the same, it liketh and
pleaseth me well.</p>
            <p>In that Christ saith, he knoweth her workes, here is a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
propertie of Christ, that he seeth all Churches, he beholdeth
all mens actions, he seeth their words, workes, affections and
actions. As he spake to the Church of Ephesus before, so now
to the Church of Smyrna, to shew them, that he is alwaies pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
in the midst of the Church, he seeth and beholdeth all her
dealings. And this consideration is most necessarie, and the
ground of all grace and religion, when a man is perswaded that
Christ seeth his heart, heareth euery word, beholdeth all his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
and marketh all his words. <hi>Dauid 139. Psalme: The
Lord beholdeth all my secrets, there is not a word in my toung, but
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:14859:92"/>
he knoweth it.</hi> So should we perswade our selues: and this would
make vs make conscience of all our words, our thoughts, our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
of all we do or say; nay, where this is wanting, there is no
true grace, no faith, no conscience: for if a man were perswaded
that Christ seeth his workes, beholds and markes them, he durst
not for his life sinne as he doth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And thy tribulation.</hi> Here he ioynes workes and tribulation
together, where we may gather, that tribulation must needs go
with workes, and with the grace of God: where grace is, there
must be tribulations: where God giueth grace, he addeth tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
first to humble them, secondly to trie them, thirdly to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent
other sinnes which they should else commit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I know thy tribulation.</hi> This then is added to comfort the
Church: as if he should say, It is true, thou art in tribulation, but
it comes not by chance, but from God my father: I know it, I see
and behold it, and haue care of it to do thee good, Psal. 113. This
knowledge is ioyned with his prouidence ouer his. This I say is
spoken to comfort vs: if we be in tribulation, we must then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
whence it cometh, namely, from God, he knoweth, and
seeth, and careth for it: this will ease vs of much griefe, and
make vs patient. So we hauing had long peace, must looke for
tribulation; which when it cometh, the onely way to arme vs
with patience, is to consider that God both seeth it and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it, and is &amp; will be a stay and prop to vphold vs, that we faint
not in misery. After he setteth out two sorts or parts of tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
first, pouertie: secondly, reproch. The first is pouertie, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
want of temporall blessings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> necessary to maintaine this
present life.</p>
            <p>Now seeing that famous Church was so afflicted with po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie:<note place="margin">Vse.</note>
we learne, that true Religion will not free a man from af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
and from pouertie: then let no man think because he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth
in Christ, he shal be rich. <hi>Obiect.</hi> But God promiseth the
fauours and blessings of this and the other life to his seruants.
<hi>Ans.</hi> He promiseth indeed, but the blessings co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of heauen without exception, &amp; temporall blessings with
condition, if they be for our good and his glory, else he will send
want and pouertie, euen to his dearest seruants.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:14859:93"/>
               <hi>I know thy pouertie:</hi> This is added to comfort her, for that her
estate in earthly things was weake; yet Christ knoweth it, he
cares and prouides for her, and will if it be for her good, free her
or else giue her patience.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> But how can her workes and pouertie stand together,
seeing she could not giue to the poore that wanted? <hi>Answ.</hi> All
good works stand not in giuing large almes to the poore, but the
works of our calling done in faith and good conscience, they be
good workes, though the other haue their place, if they be done
as they shold: for though works in our calling be most meane, yet
it is a good work to God. It is not the matter of the work, but the
maner of doing it makes a good work, namely, if it proceed from
an honest heart, and be done to Gods glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yet thou art rich.</hi> Here Christ intends to comfort her, that
though she wanted &amp; was in pouerty, yet she was rich in Christ,
she had riches in God, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 21. And this in two respects, first
when we are reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciled to God in Christ, &amp; haue assurance of the
pardon of our sinnes in him. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 9. Secondly, when we
haue grace from God to do good workes. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 18. That we
may be rich in good workes, we must lay vp a good foundation
in heauen, for Gods graces they be true riches.</p>
            <p>The poore man,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> to whom God denieth riches in this world,
he seeing his estate, must labour to haue riches in heauen, which
are true riches indeed. This is to be reconciled to God in Christ,
to haue Gods graces, whereby he can do the workes of his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
in faith and a good conscience. Againe, the men of this
world, if they would be truly rich, they must labour to
be reconciled to God in Christ: but they content themselues
with their owne riches, and neuer seeke for true riches indeed,
but are choaked with the desire of temporall riches. But all men
labour to get earthly riches, honour and temporal blessings, and
esteeme not to be rich in God; which is meere madnes.</p>
            <p>The second part of her tribulation, is her reproch, <hi>And thy
blasphemie,</hi> that is, the slaunder, reuilings and repoches of the
Church of Smyrna. This was not onely in respect of God,
but of their profession and religion: for they did reuile and slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them for their profession.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:14859:93"/>
Where we see,<note place="margin">2. King. 24.</note> that they which serue God, they must looke
for slanders,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 4.</note> reuiling, reprochings. He which desires to liue well,
to worship and serue God, he must look for these: nay if he haue
them not, he must suspect himselfe, for Christ calleth them cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
whom all men speake well of: which though it be a great
griefe, yet Christ comforts them, he knoweth it, seeth it,
and will in due time remedie it: he seeth euery slander, defamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and reproach; which should make vs patient to endure these
blasphemies.</p>
            <p>The persons which blasphemed her, <hi>They which say they be
Iewes, but be not: but are the synagogue of Satan.</hi> That is, as in other
cities of Asia &amp; Europe, there were assemblies of Iewes, that had
their abode and synagogues, so in Smyrna had they assemblies
&amp; a synagogue, perswading themselues they had a true church,
but that the other had not, and therfore slandered them for their
religion, and their Christ, whom these professed, they denied.
They were Iewes by birth, coming of the tribe of Iudah, yet
not true Iewes in profession and worship of God, but a syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue
of Satan. And so they which reproch religion, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile
the worshippers of God, they be Iewes by birth, but they
are not Iewes indeed, but enemies to God, to religion, and to
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which professe it. Now concerning these, let vs examine first
what they were in their own opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: secondly in Christs opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Which say they be Iewes.</hi> They coming of the tribe of Iudah,
they thought they were true worshippers of God, as <hi>Abraham,
Isac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> were: but Christ he saith, they be the synagogue
of Satan. And as the Iewes (enemies to God and religion) seeme
to themselues to be true professors: so all the wicked blesse them
selues in their sinnes, thinke all is well they do, as we may see
Psal. 10. they ouerthrow the truth of God by damnable here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
yet perswade themselues they hold the truth, for which they
wil die: yea witches, men and women, wil say they abhorre the
diuell, they will not haue any thing to do with him: but that by
good Angels, and some speciall gift of God, they excell other
men, &amp; are able to work wonders. And so the carnal Protestant,
he sinneth and saith God is mercifull, and so makes Christ his
packe-horse. But we must learne by their example to suspect our
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:14859:94"/>
selues, to cast downe our pride and conceit of our selues, and
not thinke too highly of our owne goodnesse, but to suspect our
selues for many sinnes. We may not say we are Iewes when we
are not.</p>
            <p>The second point is, Christs iudgement of them, he saith
they seemed to be Iewes, but were not, but indeed the syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue
of Satan, that is, a company and assembly of men which
seemed to serue God, but worshipped the diuell.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> But they were Gods chosen people, whom he chose
out of all nations to serue him: how then could they be the sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue
of Satan? <hi>Answ.</hi> There is a double election: first speciall
and particular, whereby God in his eternall counsell chooseth
one to saluation: the second is more general, whereby he admits
men into the outward Church, to be partakers of the outward
signes and priuiledges of the couenant, as the sacraments, &amp;c.
The Iewes they had the generall calling, but not the particular
election, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. and so might fall from the Church of God to
be a synagogue of Satan: for hauing only the generall election,
they might renounce the word and sacraments, but the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
election is immutable. Now let vs see when they became thus
the synagogue of Satan: it was not at that time when they put
Christ to death: for though many of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did it of knowledge, yet
very many of ignorance. And after that Christ was ascended, <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
preaching to them, tels them, that the promise belonged to
them, and to their children. It was not then at this time, but
when the Apostles had laboured by many arguments, to proue
that Christ was the Messiah, and they would not beleeue, still
remaining in their wickednesse, then they became of the church
of God a synagoue of Satan: for when they wold not heare <hi>Paul,</hi>
but threatned and reiected him, then he left them, and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
to the Gentiles, and then the Iewes became of a Church
no Church: for the holding of an heresie makes a church to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
no Church: but when a Church holds errour in princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
points of religion, and is openly conuicted by publicke
authoritie and iudgement, and stil remaines so, then it ceaseth to
be a Church, and not before, though it be reproued by a priuate
man, for that is not sufficient. So the Church of the Galatians
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:14859:94"/>
holding iustification by workes, yet ceased not to be a Church
till it was conuicted publikely by authoritie Apostolicall. And
by this we see what we may iudge of the Papists, Libertines, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie
of loue, &amp;c. which being conuicted by publique iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church of God, are no true Churches: for they
hold such heresies, as be condemned in the word, and haue bin
conuicted long agone of them. I come to the cause why they
fell, namely, their vnbeleefe. <hi>Rom. 11. Ob.</hi> But they hold the
Scriptures, and defend <hi>Moses,</hi> and the law. <hi>Answ.</hi> Though they
hold the letter, yet they corrupt the sense, and where any thing
is spoken of Christ, they seeke to ouerthrow it, and so taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the subiect and matter of the Scripture which is Christ,
they ouerthrow all: for he which worshippeth God not in, but
out of Christ, he worshippeth not God but an Idoll. So the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
hold the Scriptures in word, but in deed denie them, seeing
they take away Christ, in spoiling him of his merit and interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:
for take away his offices, and then you shall haue an halfe
Christ. This their example should be euer in our eyes, seeing
these Iewes, Gods own chosen people, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he chose out of the
whole world to serue him, they fell for want of faith, and became
the synagogue of Satan, to worship the diuell; then we must
take heed we be not proud, because we haue the word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
and seeme to be the people of God: but suspect our
selues, take heed we maintaine faith in a good conscience, and
shew it in repentance and obedience, lest we be cut off as they
were.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Feare none of those things which thou must suffer.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vers. 10.</note> In this tenth
verse is another part of the proposition. But seeing Christ com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth
the Church of Smyrna, and giueth her counsell, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buketh
her not, as the Church of Ephesus, hence some gather,
that a man may fulfill the whole law, and liue without sinne: but
they be deceiued: for Christ abstaineth here to rebuke the
church, not because there was no iust cause of reprehension in
her: but because he saw that the Church did truly beleeue and
repent, and decayed not in loue, as the church of Ephesus had
done. Secondly, he doth it, because God accepteth of the will
and indeuour of them which beleeue and repent, as of the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:14859:95"/>
deed: he taketh their labor and indeuour to obey him, as perfect
obedience at their hands. And for these two causes, Christ he
commendeth and comforteth her, giueth her counsell, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buketh
her not; not that she wanted iust cause of rebuke.</p>
            <p>Seeing that this Church was so accepted of Christ, that he
would not rebuke her, but commendeth and counselleth her,
we see it is good and necessarie for Gods Church to be in affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
sometime: for this church of Smyrna was in affliction, and
so was kept from many sinnes, which otherwise she would haue
fallen into. So for all other churches and children of God, it is
necessarie to be in affliction sometimes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But feare not.</hi> Here is Christs counsell, which hath three parts:
first, a precept: Feare not, &amp;c. secondly, a Prophecie, <hi>Behold:</hi>
thirdly, a precept againe: <hi>Be thou faithfull.</hi> The first precept is:
<hi>Feare not.</hi> This commaundement may seeme to be contrarie
to other places of Scripture, as when he biddeth vs worke out
our saluation with feare &amp; trembling; &amp;, where <hi>Paul</hi> biddeth vs
not be high minded, but feare. <hi>Answ.</hi> There be three kinds of
feare: the first, naturall: the second, of grace: the third, of vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe.
The first, which is in all men by nature, is a declining or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoiding
of death: seeing al things by nature seek to preserue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues:
and this naturall feare was in Christ, who feared death, as
it was the separation of the soule and bodie, though it was no
sinne in him, but an infirmitie. Secondly, feare is from grace.
<hi>Mal.</hi> 1. saith the Lord: <hi>If I be your Father, where is my feare?</hi>
Which is a reuerence to God in regard of his mercie and iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and this is no sinne but a vertue. The third, is from vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe,
when men for feare of persecution or other hurt, forsake
God and his religion; more fearing the persons of men, then the
maiestie of God. Now Christ speaketh not of the two first, but
of the last only: namely, a distrustful feare, when for feare of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
or affliction, we forsake God and religion; that feare
which draweth men from God to death and damnation, if they
repent not. <hi>Feare not.</hi> Here Christ sheweth the sinne of euery
man by nature: namely, to feare man more then God, to be
more affraid of the face and countenance of men, then of the
power and might of the euerliuing God: which is not onely in
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:14859:95"/>
sinners, but in the regenerate in some part, who do not consider
of God as he is indeed, a mightie Iudge taking vengeance on
sinners.</p>
            <p>In this Christ sheweth the means to arme our selues against
all such feare of perils, persecution, or daunger: namely, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
fortitude and courage: which is a gift of God proceeding
from true faith, whereby we are made able to lay aside all feare
of daunger, and to vndergo all persecutions, afflictions and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
for the maintaining of faith and a good conscience. This
Christ often prescribeth, and armeth his children with this chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
fortitude, as the Prophets and Apostles in the old and new
Testament, and now euery child of God and euery Church.
And it were to be wished, that Ministers now in our daies could
say to all Gods children, <hi>Feare not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> but alas now they must
change their voice, and crie with the Prophet, <hi>Howle and lament
in sack cloth and ashes, for your destruction is at hand.</hi> And surely
there is cause why, if one looke and view the bodie of our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
as <hi>Osea</hi> saith, there is no knowledge of God in the land, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
man seeketh to follow his owne waies, none cleaueth to
the Lord, seeketh to know and obey him. Besides, they are
altogether carnall, fleshly, dead and drowned with the cares of
this life, none affecting things belonging to eternall life: but
all mens hearts are possessed with pleasures, profits and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of this world. Nay all men in generall lye in a dead sleep,
there is no sense or feeling in them: a spirituall slumber hath
wrapped all mens hearts in securitie and ignorance, neuer thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
or considering of the iudgement to come, neuer dreaming
of the euill day, though God preach daily by his iudgement to
them. Againe, the contempt of the word and Gospell, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanation
of the Sabbath, want of mercie and loue, the cruelty
which aboundeth in all men, oppression, whoredomes, fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
these be the sinnes of the people now in our daies rife in
euery place; these are common sinnes, calling for vengeance,
which will come vndoubtedly, vnlesse we repent: so that Christ
cannot speake to vs, as to this Church, but in a contrarie voice,
But though this be the common estate of most men, yet Christ
he hath a remnant, who lament and mourne for the sins of the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:14859:96"/>
land, who are grieued with the abhominations of the world: and
these need not feare, but they must take to them Christian forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
&amp; courage, lay aside al feare of danger, &amp; of al that man can
do, and boldly vndergo all crosses and afflictions, euen to death,
to maintaine faith and a good conscience to the end. That they
may do this, let them first consider, that they which feare di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strustfully,
must haue a miserable portion, in the lake that burneth
with fire and brimstone. <hi>Reu.</hi> 21. 8. therefore for feare of this
reward, let vs go on fearing nothing.</p>
            <p>2 They must consider Gods presence: he is by them, readie
to protect and defend them, his Angels pitch their tents about
them, <hi>Psalm. 34. 12. 2. King. 6. Elishahs</hi> seruant seeing in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
an huge armie, which beset him and his maister, he saith,
Be not affraid, for they which be with vs, be more then these
against vs. He was fully perswaded of Gods presence and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and that Gods Angels would defend and guard him: so
should al men in danger, they must beleeue and perswade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
God is present, he hath his Angels pitching their tents
to defend and protect his children.</p>
            <p>3 Gods children must consider in perill, that it is an honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
thing to suffer for Christs sake, and it is a happie thing to
suffer for the Gospell of Christ. <hi>Paul</hi> he accounted it his chiefe
honour, nay he reioyced in nothing so much as in his sufferings
for Christs sake. Then if suffering the crosse for Christs sake be
such an honourable thing, we must lay aside all feare, and by
Gods grace arme our selues with Christian fortitude and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
to vndergo all crosses &amp; afflictions whatsoeuer. But those
which are not touched with the present day of miserie, nor haue
not this perfect fortitude, they must lament and howle, lest the
euill day take them vnprouided.</p>
            <p>The next part of Christs counsell is, a prediction or prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of the afflictions which this Church must suffer. But before
he propoundeth the afflictions, he setteth a word of attention:
<hi>Behold.</hi> By which he teacheth them, and in them, vs: that it is
our dutie often to thinke and consider of the time of affliction
before hand, to meditate of Gods iudgements and corrections
before they come, lest we perish in them. For Christ <hi>(Luk. 19.)</hi>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:14859:96"/>
he came to Ierusalem, and wept ouer it, and foretold the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to come: and the cause was, because <hi>she knew not the day of
her visitation:</hi> because she would not think of her iudgement and
affliction to come, therefore Christ forotels and shewes her final
destruction. Let vs take heed, lest it fall out with vs as it did with
them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It shall come to passe.</hi> By this Christ shewes he is true God. For
he which can foretell all future things in particular, though they
be contingent, he is God, for that is proper to God: but Christ
foretels their particular affliction to come, <hi>ergo</hi> he is God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> But the Phisitian can foretell the death of his patient, the
Astronomer the eclipse of the Moone to come. <hi>Answ.</hi> They do
so, but by meanes: the Phisitian foretels by the causes and signes
he seeth in the partie, by which death is in <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ort present: so the
Astronomer by the naturall course of the heauens, can foretel an
eclipse by the courses and signes of it, in which the eclipse is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent:
but without these signes and causes they cannot simply: but
Christ without any signe or cause simply foretels this affliction
in particular, to come to the Church of Smyrna.</p>
            <p>Christ describes the affliction, first by the cause, namely the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel:</hi>
secondly, the persons, <hi>some of you:</hi> thirdly, the kind, <hi>imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi>
fourthly, the end, <hi>to trie you:</hi> fifthly, the time, <hi>ten dayes.</hi> For
the first, the cause, it is the diuel. <hi>Ob.</hi> But how can he afflict them,
seeing he is a spirit and dealeth not with the bodies of men? <hi>Ans.</hi>
He is indeed a spirit, and ruleth in the aire, he is the god of this
world, he ruleth in the hearts of wicked men, he ruleth, guideth,
and gouerneth in them, directs their thoughts, wils, affections,
so as he stirres them vp, moues and caries them to persecute the
children of God, to cast them in prison. Now in that the diuell is
the author of persecution, we see of what spirit those be which
persecute the Church, namely, men inspired by the diuel, moued
and ruled by him, notorious wicked wretches, which haue Satan
for their king and ruler.<note place="margin">1. Tim. 2.</note> For this cause <hi>Paul</hi> saith, he was <hi>the chiefe
of sinners,</hi> seeing he was caried by him to persecute the church of
God. Let then all men take heed of this: for he which persecutes
the Church for religion, in word or action, he in that action is
the vassall of Satan, led and ruled by the diuell: and the diuell in
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:14859:97"/>
that action vseth him as his instrument: Satan is the chiefe and
principall agent, he is his slaue to do his will, and is as a souldier
vnder his band. Againe, learne we to take pitie on all such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
seeing they be possessed by the diuell, led and moued by
him, yea euen to pray for our persecutors. Furthermore, the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
we must haue to defend our selues in persecution, are not
temporall but spirituall: seeing our enemy is a spirit, we must vse
inuocation and praier, fasting and humbling our selues, by which
we shew our faith, repentance and obedience to God. By
this weapon of prayer, <hi>Elias</hi> is called the chariot and horsemen
of Israel: this is a most excellent weapon. And if the Lord should
send a forreine enemy among vs, then is indeed the souldier to
be vsed, but our principall weapon must be prayer, that must be
our chariot and horsemen: the diuell feareth not the sword or
gun, but this spirituall weapon will ouerthrow him. I proceed to
the second point, their affliction is described by the persons,
<hi>some of you,</hi> not all, but some of them: thirdly, by the kind of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
imprisonment, he shall not kill or destroy you, but impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
you: and some of you, not all of you. Fourthly, the end, to trie
you, that your hope, faith, patience, and other graces, may be
made knowne to your selues and other.</p>
            <p>In all these we note, that Gods prouidence is the first and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
cause aboue all causes, ouerruling, ordering, and dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
them. In this prouidence he vseth two instruments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> good, as
good Angels and regenerate men; and he workes in and by these
in all things; and in these there is a good order, no disorder. The
second kind of instruments be bad, as wicked Angels, diuels and
wicked men, which though they be wicked in themselues, yet
God can vse them well: and in these is nothing but disorder, and
the Lord he worketh by them but not in them, and permits
their disorder and sinnes, to shew by them his iustice and power.
These wicked instruments (in themselues) the Lord vseth well
and to good ends: for his prouidence is aboue them, it restraines
them, keepes in their malice, bridles them that they cannot shew
their malice to the ful, but be bridled and kept short, being ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mastred
by his prouidence. So here the diuel he afflicts them, yet
not all, but some of them, and he destroyeth not, but onely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoneth
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:14859:97"/>
them; and not alwayes, but for a short time.</p>
            <p>The second action of Gods prouidence, vsing wicked instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
is, that the Lord turneth all to the good of his children.
The diuell in afflicting them purposeth their destruction, but the
Lord turneth it to their good, to proue them, and trie the vertues
and graces of their hearts, as their faith, hope, loue, patience, &amp;c.
so that the Lord doth not onely restraine their malice, but tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
all things to the good of his people.<note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note> Now we should often
thinke of this prouidence of God, and for euer blesse his name
for the same, seeing he ouerrules the wicked instruments, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straines
their malice, he vseth them for the good of his children:
and considering of this, it shold make vs to renounce our selues,
to commit our selues to his protection, make his prouidence
our sure defence and safegard in all our temptations.</p>
            <p>And seeing the end of their affliction is to trie them,<note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> we must
al first labour to haue the power of godlinesse, not onely in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
shew and formall profession, but to feele the power of it
truly in our hearts: for the Lord wil trie vs as gold in the fire, the
Lord will cast vs into the fire of affliction, to proue vs whether
we be pure gold, whether we haue pure faith, vnfained repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and a good conscience or not: these wil abide the fire and
not burne, when formal shew of godlinesse will.</p>
            <p>2. Seeing afflictions are to trie vs, we must reioyce, and thinke
tribulation a great blessing. <hi>I am. 1. Thinke it exceeding ioy to fall
into temptations:</hi> for by affliction our graces are made manifest to
our selues and to the world. The fifth circumstance is the time,
for ten daies. Some vnderstand by this a long time, as <hi>Gen. 31. 41
Laban</hi> changed <hi>Iacobs</hi> wages ten times, that is, many times: but
it is not so here, for Christ speakes that to comfort them: now
what comfort were this, to be long in affliction? Others thinke
that by ten daies, ten yeares is meant, and that because it is often
in scripture so vsed, seeing there is a weeke of yeares as well as of
daies: but that cannot be proued, that they were in persecution
so long and no longer. Then, I take it, by ten daies is meant a
very short time, a litle space of time, and this is most sutable to all
the circumstances of the text, and the purpose of Christ, which
was to comfort the Church: as if he had said, Thinke not thy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:14859:98"/>
to be long, for it is but for ten daies, a short time.</p>
            <p>In which words note two things: first, that the afflictions of
Gods Church are for a certaine time, a time decreed and set
downe by God, that cannot be shortned or made longer. So the
Lord told <hi>Abraham,</hi> that the Israelites should be in captiuitie
and affliction 430. yeares, and so it came to passe, for they were
in affliction, especially in the land of Egypt 430. yeares: but so
soone as that time was expired, the same night were they deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
So <hi>Daniel</hi> for the space of threescore and ten yeares capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity,
prayed not to the Lord for deliuerance, for he knew the
time was certaine and could not be changed, and therefore was
patient: but when that time drew to an end, then he prayed for
deliuerance, and the Lord heard his prayer. This should
teach vs in affliction to be patient, and to seeke to arme our
selues with patience: seeing the time of our affliction is certain,
and cannot be made shorter or longer, we cannot be deliuered
till the whole time be expired. Secondly, note that the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of Gods Church and children be but for ten dayes, a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
short space of time, in respect of eternall life: and this is a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
comfort to any in the crosse and persecution, seeing the
Lord wil put an end to it, it shalbe but for ten dayes, a short time,
as <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17. But yet there is more to be noted
in these words, euery word containing an argument of comfort
for the Church: for first the author of afflictions is the <hi>diuell,</hi> he
causeth them: now feare not him, for he is Gods enemy, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thou being his enemy, hast God for thy friend, and then
what can he do to thee to hurt thee: for they which haue him
their enemy, their cause is good.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he shall not afflict all the whole Church, but <hi>some
of you,</hi> a few of them: the Lord restraines his malice, he cannot
do his wil. Thirdly, he cannot kill or destroy them, but onely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
their bodies. Fourthly, he shall not do that to their destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
as he would, but the Lord turnes it to try them for their
good. So this affliction it shall not last alwaies, but for ten daies,
a very short time, why then should you feare? Let not feare ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
your hearts, be not discouraged, but take Christs fortitude
and courage, lay aside all feare, and vndergo manfully al danger,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:14859:98"/>
to keepe faith and a good conscience to the end.</p>
            <p>The third part of Christs counsell is another precept, which
containeth a most blessed and heauenly counsell: <hi>be thou
faithfull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The children of God ought to be faithfull, in regard of God,
and that fidelitie they owe to him, first, by promise made to
him in baptisme; for in that Sacrament God promiseth to his
child, Christ with all his benefits, and the child of God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
and maketh this stipulation to God, that he will renounce
himselfe, and in death and life rely onely on Christ. Now when
a man keepeth this promise made in baptisme, and performeth
this condition to God and stipulation, then he is faithfull to
God; &amp; when he breaketh it, then he is vnfaithfull. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21.
Secondly, the Lord he giueth his seruants many graces, as faith,
hope, loue, repentance, &amp;c. these he committeth to man, to see
how he will vse or abuse them. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 20. we must labour
to keepe them, to vse them well: and this if we do to Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
and to our owne good, then we be faithfull to God, else not:
as if a man commit a thing to be kept by another, if he loose it,
or keepe it not well, he is not faithfull to him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Be faithfull.</hi> As if he had said: Thou hast made a promise in
baptisme, to keepe faith and a good conscience: and thou hast
had many graces, promising to vse them well, to keepe
them in life and death, &amp; be faithfull in persecutions &amp; afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
keepe faith and a good conscience, and then thou artfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
Against this dutie three sorts of men offend: first, they
which though they haue made a couenant in baptisme to serue
the Lord, to keep faith and a good conscience, yet liue in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and securitie, neuer seeking to know the Lord, to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
his will, or to obey him: yet these will brag of their good
meanings, though they haue no care at all to please God, no
care to keepe their couenant made with God, and their stipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
in baptisme to him. Secondly, they which for a good
while haue had faith and a good conscience, and haue come to
serue the Lord, yet after long time fall away, being entangled
with the world, with the profits and sinnes thereof, and so leaue
all and come to breake faith and a good conscience: both these
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:14859:99"/>
are vnfaithfull seruants, and their reward (if the Lord dealt in iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
with them) is destruction: and yet all men in a maner be of
these two sorts, they either liue in ignorance, or fall away after
a long time. The third sort are they which professe a long time,
liue in faith and good conscience, and be earnest professors, yet
in time of triall and persecution, they will leaue all profession
of religion to saue themselues. Then seeing all these offend,
we must labour to know God, to obey him, to keepe his graces
bestowed on vs to the end, to liue and die in his seruice, and to
lose our life rather then any one grace which God bestoweth
vpon vs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And I wil giue thee the crown of life.</hi> Here is a reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to moue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to go on in persecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to be faithful to the end. He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the Papists
gather, that a man may merit heauen, seeing there is promised a
crowne of life. <hi>Ans.</hi> It is called a crowne of life by resemblance:
for as men in a race, first run, and after they obtaine the crowne
at the end of their race: so men must first in this world liue godly,
run and finish their course, after that, they haue their crowne in
heauen. I answer againe; this reward is not of the worke, but the
promise is made to the workers, not to the martyredome, but to
the martyr, which hath by suffering death shewed his faith in
Christ: it is not made to the passion or suffering, but to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
suffering, &amp; not for his suffering, but to him as he is in Christ,
&amp; declared to be so by his suffering death. So then, that promise
is not made to the work, but to the worker, and not for his work,
but for the worthinesse of Christ, in whom he is a true member
of the Church.</p>
            <p>The vse then is,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> that if we keepe this promise in Baptisme,
made before God, his Angels, and the Church, we shall haue
the reward of all, which is the crowne of life in the kingdome
of heauen, promised to such as be faithfull to the end.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let him which hath an eare,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verse 11.</note> 
               <hi>heare.</hi> In these words are the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
or last part of the Epistle. Now in these three verses for
the most part is a rehearsall of those things which Christ deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
before, in this and in the former Chapter.</p>
            <p>Now seeing Christ the head and Doctor of his Church is
most perfect in his doctrines, both for matter and maner of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuering
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:14859:99"/>
the same, seeing he repeateth againe and againe the
same things, and seeing <hi>Peter</hi> put them often in mind of their
common saluation, hence we note, that Ministers may often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate
the same doctrine: not onely the same matter, but in the
same maner and words. So did Christ the head Doctor of the
Church, so may we or any preacher preach the same sermon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
in maner and matter, not for to ease our selues, but for the
good and benefite of the Church: as Christ seuen times repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the same doctrine to the good of the Church, and common
benefite of all. The hearers then if they find the Preacher shall
deliuer the same doctrine againe, or often, they must not find
fault, for then they might as well find fault with Christ himselfe,
who not once or twise, but often repeated the same words.</p>
            <p>In this eleuenth verse is a conclusion of the Ep<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>stle to the
Church of Smyrna, and it hath two parts: first, a commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
secondly, a promise. In the commandement, first what is
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded: secondly, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The duty commanded, is to heare.
There are two kinds of hearing good, and bad. Here he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
good hearing, with faith and obedience, not naked and
bare outward hearing. Then we see the true knowledge of the
Gospell standeth in hearing with faith and obedience: for we
know no more then we beleeue and obey: if we beleeue and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
nothing, we heare and know nothing with sound hearing
to saluation. The second thing is, to whom the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is giuen, to them <hi>which haue eares to heare:</hi> for some are
deafe, some be liuely and hearing hearers. They are deafe, which
heare onely with outward and bodily eares, not affected in hart,
nor chaunged in life by the word: they are good hearing hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
which are touched and affected by the word, changed and
renued in life by the same, hauing not onely outward eares of
the head, but inward, bored by Gods spirit in the heart.</p>
            <p>Hence we learne two things:<note place="margin">Vse.</note> first, that election is not gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
and vniuersall of euery particular man: for there is, was, and
shall be euer some deafe hearers. Secondly, we learne our duty,
that we must not onely heare the word, and lend our outward
eares, but withall ioyne faith, obedience, and conuersion in life,
so heare that we be changed in life, and turned to God, else our
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:14859:100"/>
hearing is fruitlesse, nay to damnation. The third thing is, what
they must heare: <hi>What the Spirit saith:</hi> namely, that which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in the former words deliuered by Christ. The principall
things be these: first, that the Lord seeth and regardeth the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations
and afflictions of his Church: secondly, that Gods
Church and people being to suffer the crosse and afflictions,
must forethinke of it, and consider of it before it come; &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
must arme themselues with Christian courage and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
not to feare too much. Thirdly, they must be faithfull to
God in regard of their promise and couenant in baptisme, in
keeping faith and good conscience, and in defence of true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
euen to death. So that they must heare these three: the first,
concerning Gods prouidence, seeing and regarding his church:
the second, concerning Christian fortitude<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; courage in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
the third, our faithfulnes &amp; constancy in defence of faith &amp; a
good conscience, maintaining of true religion to the end. These
three are the things they should heare and consider: and so we
must consider and learne the same. To excite them and vs to
these three things, to heare and know the three duties, he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
two reasons: first, because the Spirit speaketh: the second
is, the persons to whom he spake, not to one, but all Churches,
directly to them of Smyrna, and in them to all churches, to all
of vs, no man is excepted but must heare him.</p>
            <p>The second part of the conclusion is a promise: <hi>He which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercometh
shal not be hurt.</hi> That we may ouercom, two things are
required: first, to renounce and go out of our selues: secondly,
to cast all our hope, trust and affiance in Christ: which when we
do, then we haue sauing faith, and this ouercometh all our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
The second thing is, to keep faith and a good conscience,
to defend true religion, to the end of our dayes, against all ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And shall not be hurt of the second death:</hi> that is, eternall death:
for the first death is, when the bodie and soule are separated in
this life: the second, when both bodie and soule are separated
from God for euer. In which separation <hi>(Reu. 21.)</hi> consisteth
the destruction of a man, euen the suffering of the fire of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:14859:100"/>
lake. It is then as if he said: though he shall suffer the first
death, yet he shall not be hurt of the second, he shall escape that
fire and lake for euer. This is a most comfortable and happie
promise to escape the lake of hell. Here note, first to whom this
promise is made, <hi>to them which ouercome,</hi> to them which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
themselues, put their trust and affiance onely in Christ,
and labour to keep faith &amp; a good conscience to the end. Then
if we would ouercome, it is not enough to know, to teach, or
heare of religion: but true profession is ioyned with fighting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all the enemies of the same with christian courage, let
none of them raigne ouer vs, but fight till we ouercome and get
victorie ouer them all, then we ouercome indeed, and then to
vs is made this promise. Alas it is nothing to know or approue
religion, and yet to liue in sinne, and to let the diuell, the world,
and ourflesh raigne ouer vs. Then we must neuer content our
selues with bare profession, but labour to say in our hearts, that
we are conquerers of hell, death, &amp;c. by grace of Christ in vs;
and then we haue a blessed promise of freedome from the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
death, and of eternall happinesse: we shall not feare the
fire of hell, the burning lake. Furthermore, in these words is
answered a question, which many a mans heart maketh, but few
in the truth of heart can answer. How may I escape the burning
lake, how can I flie and auoid the second death? <hi>Ans.</hi> Thou must
in this life turne truly to God, from all thy euill waies, renounce
thy selfe, beleeue and put thine assurance in Christ, and withall
endeuour to keep faith and a good conscience to the end, and
then thou shalt escape the second death, the fiery lake of hel shal
not hurt thee; though thou shalt tast of the first, yet thou shalt not
see the second death.</p>
            <p>Would any haue his soule escape this burning lake, haue his
silly soule free from the torments of hell? let him turne to God,
renounce himselfe, put his trust and confidence in Christ, neuer
turne to his former sinnes, and withall take heed to maintaine
and keepe faith, a good conscience, and maintaine pure and true
religion to the end, and then he shall be free from the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
lake.</p>
            <p>Further, we see by these words, that of the two deaths, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:14859:101"/>
is the worse, and most properly death: for the first is but a
preparation to the second: the second is the cruell death and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of body and soule. This is yet the madnes of men, that
they feare the pangs of the first and not of the second, neuer
thinke of the burning lake: like children, which feare shadowes,
and neuer feare fire or water, but suffer themselues to be drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
or burned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And to the Angell which is at Pergamus.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 12.</note> In these words is the
third particular commaundement of Christ to <hi>Iohn,</hi> for the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and publishing of this third Epistle to the Church of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamus.
By the Angell of this Church, is meant either the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
and Pastor, or company of the Ministers &amp; gouernors of the
same. So often in the word, one is put for a multitude. This par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
commaundement is giuen to <hi>Iohn</hi> by Christ, to assure him
of his calling to pen this booke and Epistle: secondly, to assure
the Church of the authoritie of the booke, seeing it is deliuered
by Christ himselfe.</p>
            <p>The Epistle hath three parts: first, a preface: secondly, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position:
thirdly, a conclusion. The Preface in these words, <hi>Thus
saith he with hath that sharp, &amp;c.</hi> the proposition in the thirteenth
verse, the conclusion in the seuenteenth verse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus saith he.</hi> Here he sheweth in whose name he wrote this
Epistle, to wit, Christs: who is described, that he is not onely a
Prophet and Priest, but a King, in gouerning and guiding his
Church, for he hath a sword in his hand, which is described, first
that it hath to edges. Secondly, it is sharpe, meaning by it the
word of God, so as not onely the doctrine of the law, but the
promises of the Gospell are of the like power. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 4. 12.</p>
            <p>Christ is thus set out to comfort the Church of Pergamus, for
by this Christ signifies three things: first, that he by power of the
word killeth sinne, wounds it at the heart, he killeth and slayeth
the corruption of our nature so deadly that it cannot recouer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine:
secondly, that he wil strengthen and maintaine the church
and the members of the same by this sword, against al their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
for he will not onely hurt the enemies, but defend his by
his sword.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> How doth he wound them by the word? <hi>Answ.</hi> The
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:14859:101"/>
word must be knowne and beleeued of vs. Now when we know
and beleeue the law, and the threates thereof, and the points and
promises of the Gospell: then if afflictions come, faith by
which we beleeue them, maketh vs that we are comforted, and
armeth vs against all afflictions and persecutions, so that
nothing can hurt vs: but if we beleeue it not, then the word
is to vs as a sword in a sheath, not drawn out, nor vsed to defend
or driue backe our enemies; but being beleeued, it is powerfull,
no might of man or any Prince is comparable. Thirdly, Christ
destroyeth and killeth all our enemies, all the aduersaries of the
Church, &amp; this is the principal end of this sword: for Christ spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
these words to comfort his Church in persecutions, and for
this he is said to haue a sharpe two edged sword, for he killeth
and slayeth the enemies of his Church, partly in this life, but
deadly in the life to come. In this life, the word serueth to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince
them of hypocrisie, vnbeleefe, heresies, &amp; superstition; for
Christ he abolished them with the breath of his mouth, that is,
this sword, 2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. Secondly, when they be touched by the
preaching of this word with desperations; for when the law and
Gospell is preached to them, it wounds them to the heart, by
reuealing all their cursed dealings, their vnbeleefe and hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
and sets the conscience on the racke, and stirres it vp, which is
fit of it selfe to accuse them when it hath reuealed their sinnes:
then it smites them with feare and horror, and makes their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
more fit to accuse &amp; terrifie them; and then though they
run on in sin, yet they haue a deadly wound of desperation, and
this increaseth in this life and slayeth in the next, for it cleane
cuts them off, when Christ shall say, Go yee cursed: this smiteth
them starke dead, casting them into eternall destruction for
euer.</p>
            <p>We must labour to haue the word of God worke powerfully
in vs.<note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note> to take place in our hearts by faith, not onely to shew our
sins, &amp; Gods wrath against the same, but withal to wound them,
slay and kill them, and at the first to wound deadly: for onely to
haue our sins detected, and our consciences terrified, this is the
way to desperation, and the first wound to death, but we must
go further, haue our corrupt hearts ript vp, wounded, crucified,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:14859:102"/>
haue them reformed, and this is the way to wound our soules,
and the end why Christ hath the two edged sword.</p>
            <p>The second part is the proposition, containing two parts: first
a commendation: secondly, a rebuke. The commendation in the
thirteenth verse: <hi>I know thy workes.</hi> In these words he commends
this Church, first in generall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> secondly in particular: generally in
these words, <hi>I know thy workes:</hi> that is, thy waies and doings, thy
counsels, affaires, and withall I approue them, as Psal. 1. 6. <hi>The
Lord knoweth the righteous,</hi> that is, he approues them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I know thy works.</hi> Christ he begins with these words in this and
euery of these Epistles, to teach vs one especiall thing; that the
feare of God is the chiefe thing to be learned, the beginning of
all religion; and for this cause he beginneth thus, <hi>I know thy
workes,</hi> three or foure times.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I know:</hi> shewing by this, that wheresoeuer we be, we are in the
presence of Christ, he sees all our works, he heareth and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
all we do, we cannot go out of his presence: and to settle this
deepely in our hearts, that he is present alwaies, seeing and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
vs, he repeates this seuen times, in the beginning of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
Epistle. Then this should teach vs both Minister and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
to labour to haue this perswasion in our hearts, that Christ is
present, seeth and beholdeth all we do, when we take any thing
in hand, he stands at our elbowes, looketh on vs whether we do
well or ill: then we must labour to haue this perswasion in our
hearts, that we can say, now I do this or that, my Sauiour Iesus
Christ, my Lord and redeemer, he beholds me, lookes on me,
seeth all my dealings, therefore I will behaue my selfe well. And
the Preacher may spend himselfe in speaking, and to no purpose,
till God giue grace, to teach the people this one point, which is
the beginning and ground of all religion and feare of God: for
men may haue knowledge, and speake much of the words of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
yet they cannot be true Christians, till they haue learned
this one point, to be so perswaded as they can say in their heart,
Christ seeth and beholds me: and till we can do that, we shall
make conscience of no sinne.</p>
            <p>2 The particular, first commendation, <hi>And where thou dwellest:</hi>
though thou dwel in a place where the diuel hath set his throne,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:14859:102"/>
a place most incommodious and vnfit, yet thou obseruest and
keepest my name and religion: thus he commendeth her for
her constancie in religion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Throne.</hi> That is, any place where superstition, idolatrie and
wickednesse is practised without controlment, and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence
wickednesse is conueyed to other places: for the diuell is the
god of this world. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. and he hath his kingdome, throne
and seate placed, where he can practise sinne and wickednesse,
where iniquitie is maintained, the Gospell despised, and from
whence he conueyeth his diuellish wickednesse to other places.
Such a place was <hi>Pergamus,</hi> a citie wherein sinne did abound
without controlment, religion despised, and from whence wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse
was conueyed to many other cities, townes, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
Here we may note the diuels pollicie, who hath his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
here on earth like to God; here he placeth his thrones as
a Prince, and maketh choice to haue the fittest place where he
may rule and raigne, and practise wickednesse without control<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
&amp; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence he may conuey it to other places; he hath
euer had, hath now, &amp; will haue his thrones. He had in old time
the high places, the groues, and such places where the people
committed idolatrie. Among the Gentiles there were Oracles
to erect his thrones: for in them he gaue answers, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed
his wickednesse to many. In later dayes he had euery
church and chappell his throne, when Images, Saints Roodes,
and such like were erected, to which all men from all parts of
the land came to worship. In schooles of learning he had his
thrones, when nothing was taught but superstition and errors.
And now in our times he hath his thrones, and officers to attend
on the same, as wisemen, and these are a speciall meanes to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
his throne: for vnto these come men from farre and neare,
so that he conueyeth his iniquitie to many, seeing many seeke
to them, and so do him homage. So dicing and brothell houses,
seeing in them iniquitie is practised, in them is his throne. In fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
where they liue in ignorance, in sinne and wickednesse,
in blaspheming and drunkennesse, or any one sinne, there is his
throne: and so many thrones as families, where they liue by any
vniust dealing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:14859:103"/>
Then it is necessarie,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> seeing the diuell hath his throne, the
Lord should haue his opposite to this: as, when men
haue thrones of iustice both ciuill and ecclesiasticall: ciuill, to
represse all iniustice and wickednesse, to punish vice, to reward
vertue: and ecclesiasticall, to punish and reprehend those sinnes,
which ciuill iustice cannot.</p>
            <p>The diuell cunningly and pollitickly chooseth Pergamus not
a base towne or village, but a huge citie, whence many kings
proceeded, where there was a famous and great king, and where
was much people. So he chose Babylon a citie of confusion and
abhomination. So he hath chosen Rome which is become of a
famous Church, the throne of Satan. So Ierusalem the citie of
God, the temple of God, first began to be a denne of theeues,
and then the citie fell to wickednesse: so the diuell getteth Gods
temple, and the holy citie to be his throne. And in our time he
getteth the great cities, &amp; shire townes for his throne: for in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
is greater ignorance, and the Gospell more contemned, then in
small villages, in which after litle preaching it is willingly
embraced. Now the cause of this is, because the diuell laboureth
especially to haue his throne where he may do the most harme,
and conuey his doctrine to moe places, and liue without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolment.</p>
            <p>If this or any other shire towne,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> or any great citie liue in sin,
in ignorance, and contemne the Gospell, take heed: for they
shall become in time a denne of theeues, and a synagogue of
Satan, he will haue his throne there. Now then it is our dutie
to labor against him, to haue his throne plucked downe, to haue
him defaced and cast out, haue our bodies and soules subiect to
Christ, renounce our selues, relye wholly on Christ, forsake our
owne waies, neuer lend our eares to Satan, let him haue no foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in vs, neuer suffer him to come to haue his throne begunne,
but still labour to haue it razed and turned vpside downe: and
withall suffer Christ to rule, suffer him alone to possesse our
hearts, that so the kingdome of Satan being ouerthrowne, the
kingdome of Iesus Christ may be increased daily in vs. Wheras
the Church of God is gathered out of that place, where the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
hath his kingdome erected, we note, that the Church of
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:14859:103"/>
God is a companie of men deriued and taken out of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue
of Satan, the kingdome of the diuell, though it be a cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
people, yet it is picked out of the kingdome of the diuell,
where he ruleth: <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 12. 13. for all men are by nature the vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals
of Satan, and subiects in his kingdome.</p>
            <p>Then no man must stand of his gentilitie,<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> and of his nobility
and bloud: but all our true ioy must be in this, that we are the
members of the true Church of God: for what will it auaile a
man to haue a golden chaine on his necke, and haue his will and
affections vnder the slauerie of the diuell: or to be the sonne of
a Prince, and yet to be out of the true Church, and to be in the
companie of the wicked, a slaue and vassall of the diuell? But our
ioy must be in this, that we are members of the Church of God,
and haue right to the kingdome of heauen.</p>
            <p>Sundrie men thinke,<note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> a man may be saued by any religion,
and most of the common people thinke, that good meaning
will saue them: but a man may professe any religion, and haue
good meaning, and yet not know one step to the kingdome of
heauen, but remaine the vassall and slaue of Satan. For a man
may haue outward ciuill iustice, and ciuill pollicie, and meane
well, yet be the seruant of the diuell.</p>
            <p>We see the children of God gaine a priuiledge aboue all
other:<note place="margin">Vse 3.</note> for in affliction and persecution, though they be cast into
dangers, yet they may assure themselues, seeing they be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Gods church, they be freed from the kingdome of the
diuell, and so from that place of darknesse.</p>
            <p>Seeing the preaching of the word gained a Church in the
middle of the kingdome of the diuell,<note place="margin">Vse 4.</note> we see the word hath a
diuine power: for there is no creature which hath greater power
in earth then the diuell, (except good Angels) yet the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of the word draweth one out of the kingdom of the diuel,
and gathereth a Church in the midst of his kingdome.</p>
            <p>Seeing in Pergamus,<note place="margin">Vse 5.</note> where the throne of the diuell was,
Gods children were, we see that God will haue his seruants to
dwell in the middle of the wicked, and mingled with the vassals
of the diuell: yet so, as he doth this for good causes: first, that
their faith, obedience, and repentance, might be exercised: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:14859:104"/>
that so they might be kept fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many grieuous sins, into
which else they would fall. So when the Lord brought the Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites
into the land of Canaan, he would not cast all their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
out at once; but they must be mingled, and dwell with the
Canaanites: for if they should destroy them at once, the wild
beasts might haue destroyed the land: so the Church must be
mingled with euill men, that the godly may be exercised, and
that they might be kept from more grieuous sinnes. Secondly,
he will haue his children to dwell with wicked &amp; vngodly men,
that their godly life might shine as lights among them. <hi>Philip.</hi>
2. 17. and so to winne them to the Gospell: for a godly life is
most effectuall to win men to Christ. Thirdly, that the Lord
might shew speciall tokens of his loue and fauour to them, that
when he bringeth his iudgements on the wicked, yet he defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
them. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 9. 4. He marked them which mourned, that
they might escape the iudgement which was brought on Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem.
Then if any man dwell among such as contemne and
hate religion, and the doctrine of the Gospell, let them be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented,
seeing it is Gods will they should dwell with the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
and the Lord will haue his Church on earth proued and
exercised by them.</p>
            <p>We see it is lawfull for men to dwell with and by such wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
men:<note place="margin">Vse 6.</note> but they must not communicate with them in their
sinnes, but abstaine from their wickednesse: as <hi>Lot</hi> in Sodome,
and <hi>Noah</hi> dwelt with the wicked men of the old world: and the
church of Pergamus in the place where the diuels kingdom was
erected For <hi>(1. Cor. 7.)</hi> there is a question, whether a seruant
hauing a maister which is an infidell, may forsake him or not:
the answer is made: he must dwell with him; but so, that therby
he deny not the principall grounds of religion, but keepe a
good conscience towards God in all things.</p>
            <p>And hence we may see how to answer that old obiection of
the Papists: Where was our Church fourscore yeares agone, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Luther</hi> preached, when the doctrine of Antichrist was in
all Europe? By the like I aske: Where was the Church of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamus,
when the kingdome of the diuell was there? The holy
Ghost telleth vs, that in the same time when the diuell had ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:14859:104"/>
his throne mightily in that place, yet there was the church
of God. So when the man of sinne had spread his doctrine of
wickednesse in all Europe, yet there was a Church amongst vs,
in this and other lands: as appeares, in that euer there was some,
which both openly and priuately oppugned his doctrine, by
word and writing in all ages: which shews, that though sin ruled
in this church many hundred yeares, yet the Lord had professors
though not so visible as now it is, when men may professe open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in euery place without feare.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And kept my name.</hi> Though thou dwellest in a place where the
diuel hath erected his throne, yet thou maintainest my name,
and holdest it fast, so that neither fraud nor force of enemies can
take it from thee.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My name:</hi> that is, my doctrine of the Gospell. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. Thou
doest constantly hold and maintaine it, and my religion: thou
beleeuest the doctrine of saluation which my seruants haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
to thee. So that in these words Christ commends the
church of Pergamus for constancie in maintaining the doctrine
of saluation.</p>
            <p>We see it is not enough for vs,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> to hold, beleeue, and maintaine
religion, but we must do it constantly, (so the word signifi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s) we
must hold the same fast against all aduersaries, not easily turned
with any blast of mens doctrine, but so to hold religion, that no
enemy by force or fraud draw it from vs. When <hi>(Math. 13.)</hi> the
man found the pearle, he sold all to buy the field. And if a man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
vs should find in our field, by his cunning and skil, a gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
mine, he would not tel it to any, but go and sel all he had, &amp;
buy the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that so he might inrich himself. So we, if we know
the doctrine of saluation, we must labor to make it ours, to haue
it made sure to vs, to sell all we haue, to loose life it selfe rather
then to forgo that precious pearle. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 9. Faith is compared
to a precious iewell, which must be laid vp in the treasury of a
good conscience, which cannot be broken into, but must be
strong: in which store-house and treasury we must haue true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and faith locked, that nothing get it from vs, but loose all
we haue, euen our life before we part with it: for if that be sure,
all is well; but if faith and religion be lost, all is gone; saluation is
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:14859:105"/>
lost, thy soule is perished.</p>
            <p>Now for her further commendation, Christ sets out her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie
by two arguments: first, that she held religion without
deniall: secondly, that she held it in the time of bloudy persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
1. The Church of Pergamus neuer denied Religion, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolted
from faith in Christ: she did not as many men, who
hold, beleeue and maintaine religion, yet in time of triall they
will reuolt. In this we must imitate her, else we know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Lord will giue vs grace to repent: if he should not, we
perish. <hi>Esaw</hi> sold his birth-right for a small thing, a few red pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage;
but after he sought it with repentance and teares, &amp; could
not get it. We must then hold religion, and not in time of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and persecution reuolt and deny it, lest the Lord giue vs
no grace to repent, which we know not whether he will or
not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And hast not denied my faith:</hi> that is, mine owne doctrine of
the Gospell, and true Religion. Religion is called Christs: first,
because Christ with the Father and holy Ghost is author of it, all
Religion which is good being from aboue: secondly, because he
reuealed it from the bosome of his Father: thirdly, because Christ
is the matter of al religion; Christ is the whole subiect of religion
in the old and new Testament, the end of the law, and the scope
of the Gospell.</p>
            <p>The second argument, whereby Christ sets out her constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
is, that she held religion in the time of bloudy persecution:
when she was thus persecuted, she was constant. When <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiphas</hi>
was put to death. Who this <hi>Antiphas</hi> was, it is not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
knowne by any history, yet it is thought he was Pastor
and Minister of the Church of Pergamus, who opposed himself,
and oppugned the doctrine and idolatry of the heathen in that
citie. In these words are two points: first, he commends this
martyr <hi>Antiphas:</hi> when he saith, <hi>That my seruant, my faithfull ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant
Antiphas,</hi> he extols him to the Church of Pergamus. By
this we see, that it is lawfull to honour and commend Martyrs
which dy for Christs cause, and that in two things: first, in giuing
them their due deserued honour and commendation, as Christ
did to <hi>Antiphas:</hi> secondly, by careful imitation of their constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:14859:105"/>
and vertues, and conuersation of life: for this cause Christ
commends this good Martyr, that the people of Pergamus
might imitate him in his constancie, not to honour him (as the
Papists do) with diuine honour and inuocation. Againe, he saith
<hi>That my faithfull Martyr,</hi> not commending him for his death
that he died, but for the cause: for not the death but the cause
makes a Martyr, for a man may die for heresie and erronious o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
and yet he is no Martyr. But <hi>Antiphas</hi> he was a true Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr,
<hi>ergo</hi> Christ saith, <hi>that my seruant,</hi> nay that my <hi>faithfull seruant
Antiphas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the end of this verse, he setteth downe the authors of this
death of <hi>Antiphas: Some among you:</hi> some of Pergamus were
the cause of his Martyrdome, they were such in whom the diuell
ruled and raigned; and this he repeates, to shew that they which
haue contemned Christs religion, though they pretend good
things, yet they be the slaues of the diuell, he rules and raignes in
them, they be his holds and castels.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> But why did the diuell dwell in the citie of Pergamus,
more then in any other? <hi>Answ.</hi> Because many in this citie were
Gentiles, they hated and conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned the Gospel, &amp; so became the
holds of the diuel: we must then take heed we neuer conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne the
fame. For in a family where they liue in ignorance, in iniustice,
fraud and wickednes, there the diuell ruleth, he hath his throne,
that is, a stable for him to dwell in. Then masters of families, and
parents which gouern families, must see they loue and embrace
religion, and teach it to their family, else their houses be but the
stables of Satan, his place to dwell in.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> But whether might not <hi>Antiphas</hi> being Minister and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor
of that Church haue fled? <hi>Answ.</hi> Persecution is double, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
directed against the person of the Minister principally, or
to the whole Church equally: if it be against his person he may
flie safely, if he get oportunitie to preserue his life, and haue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie
of the Church to flie; but if it respect the whole Church,
then vnlesse he haue libertie graunted by them, he must
stay and take part with them in their persecution. Now of this
sort was <hi>Antiphas</hi> persecution, seeing he was so called of God to
suffer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:14859:106"/>
               <hi>But I haue a few things against thee.</hi> He commended her before,
but here he rebukes her; and this reproofe is first generally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
then in more particular: in generall he tels them, that
they wanted zeale, <hi>Thou bearest with them which, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But I haue.</hi> These words he spake to the church of Ephesus
before, and here repeates them againe, teaching the true mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Church, to enter into their owne hearts, to search
what is in them that Christ may haue against them, to cal them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
to a strait reckoning, to consider all the things they haue
done from their beginning to their end, and al their life narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to examine themselues, to lay their sinnes before their eyes,
without flattering or fauouring themselues, not after their owne
mind to iudge of them, but to examine them by the rule of Gods
word; and in all their life looke what things there be for which
Christ wil come against them. For want of this, many men being
in the church perish, neuer consider their former life, how they
haue liued, and for what sins Christ wil come against them. If we
would escape death by Christs heauy and strait sentence, and
come to life, we must thus call our selues to a reckoning, and
simply lay all our sinnes in word, thought and deed before
our eyes, to thinke what we haue deserued, and to condemne
our selues: then we shall preuent that iudgement of Christ, he
shall not need to enter into sentence with vs, if we haue put all
our sinnes in a booke and reckoned already for them. The pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
of this duty, is the foundation of all religion, and the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of all grace in the heart: but the want of this is the ruine of
mens soules, and the ready way to destroy them. And if this be
wanting, the Minister may speake and preach to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Because thou hast borne with them:</hi> that is, entertained them
which are wicked. Here the fault is in more particular, namely,
want of zeale: they suffered men which maintained damnable
doctrine, and heretical opinions to be among them, and dwell
among them, such as held the doctrine of <hi>Balaam:</hi> so we see,
though they held religion, yet they did it coldly, not shewing
their feruent zeale against such as maintained damnable do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.
By this we see the Church may vse zeale in excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:14859:106"/>
and cutting off those which maintaine damnable and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall
doctrine: they may after due admonition excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
them, and cut them off as pernitious members. 1. <hi>Tim. 2.
Alexander</hi> and <hi>Hymineus</hi> were excommunicated: &amp; the church
may follow <hi>Paules</hi> example, to cut off such as hold heresies in
the fundamentall points of religion. And seeing Christ was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
for this their forbearing of those wicked men, we see, we
must not entertaine such as hold such errors and damnable do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine:
but haue indignation against them, hate their opinions,
and detest them. The Church must be couragious to defend
truth in religion, to stand against wicked heretikes, to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
and thrust them out of the Church, if they remaine ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vers. 14. Thou hast.</hi> That is, thou entertainest certaine wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
men, and euil persons, which maintaine and teach <hi>Balaams</hi>
doctrine, the doctrine of the false Prophet. And as Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued
them here, so he might as well say to vs in this Church,
that he hath something against vs, for want of zeale and seueri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
against sinne and sinners: for though our Church doth not
hold and maintaine, but repell the false doctrine of the Church
of Rome, of the Anabaptists, and the Familie of loue: yet Christ
may truly say, he hath something against vs, for want of zeale a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
sinners and wicked men. For in our Church they abound,
there is abundance of Atheists and wicked men in the midst of
vs, which are partakers of the word &amp; Sacraments, &amp; al outward
priuiledges of the Church: and these Atheists, though not in
word, yet in life, deny God and religion: they know not God,
cannot distinguish betweene true religion, and the heresies and
damnable doctrine of the Papists: they thinke not reuerently of
the word of God, nor of his Ministers and Ambassadours. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
vs there be abundance of Epicures, who giue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
to all licentiousnesse, to eate, drinke, and sport themselues:
these loue not the word, but being vnder the law of the land,
they will heare sometimes, once a yeare receiue the Sacrament,
and this is all. There are also vnmercifull and cruell men, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressors,
men which in their priuate callings vse all iniustice, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt,
fraud, wrong, oppression, with vsurie, and such horrible
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:14859:107"/>
sinnes: these are suffered in the Church, and these be the wise
men of the world, we count them as politicke and great men.
Now the suffering of these men amongst vs, sheweth, that in our
Church is great want of zeale, feruencie and seueritie, for which
Christ will come against vs, as to the Church of Pergamus.</p>
            <p>The reason followeth, and the confirmation of his rebuke,
which is to moue the Church of Pergamus, to detest the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of <hi>Balaam</hi> the false Prophet; and it is taken from the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of <hi>Balaam,</hi> that he gaue wicked counsell to <hi>Balaak,</hi> to cast
a blocke in the way of the children of Israel, to make them eate
of things offered to idols, and commit fornication. It standeth
in a comparison or similitude: As the false Prophet <hi>Balaam</hi> cast
a stumbling blocke before the Israelites, to moue them to eate
of things offered to Idols, and commit fornication: so there are
some among the Church of Pergamus, which labour to moue
men to the same sinnes.</p>
            <p>The first part of the similitude is in the first part of this verse:
as <hi>Balaam</hi> taught false doctrine, and gaue ill counsell to <hi>Balaak,</hi>
&amp;c. In which we must consider three things: first, what his false
counsell was, and what an offence is: secondly, the casting of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
before the Israelites: thirdly, the meanes how. An offence
properly is any thing, word, or deed, which is cast in a mans way
to make him stumble or fall, or go out of his way, as a stone, or
peece of wood, or such like thing: this is a scandall or stumbling
blocke properly. Here it is taken (by comparison) for any thing
which hindereth a man in the way to saluation, which hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
or stoppeth him, maketh him fall, or go out of the way.</p>
            <p>Offence is double, either giuen or taken. Offence giuen, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
word or deed, whereby a man is procured to sinne: offence
taken, is when a man taketh occasion to sin, or to be offended
by that which is done well of another. So when Christ did well,
and preached the true doctrine of saluation, the Pharises were
offended at his doctrine: he did well, they tooke occasion
to be offended at his well doing. Now one giueth an offence,
when he maketh one offended, and causeth him (as much as he
can) to sinne. So <hi>Peter</hi> telleth Christ, that the things he spake
of should not come to him: Christ biddeth him, come behind
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:14859:107"/>
him Satan: where <hi>Peter</hi> gaue an offence to Christ, though Christ
did not sinne; for Christ tooke not the occasion which <hi>Peter</hi> yet
offered. As for the giuing of offence, it is to cause a man to sin,
or fall away from God by any thing. The meanes are things ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
simply euill, or indifferent. By things in themselues euill, as
those which are directly against the word of God. Those things
euill in themselues, be either ill perswasions, or ill examples: for
by these offences are often giuen: for euill perswasions and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
draw the better sort often to sin, and are very dangerous
meanes to make men offend. Againe, offences be giuen by
things indifferent, not euill in themselues, but when men vse
them vnseasonably and vnfitly, out of time and place, and not
before fit persons. So <hi>Paul</hi> saith, that if to eate should offend, he
would neuer eate: 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. So here <hi>Balaam</hi> giueth offence,
they of Pergamus take it, to commit sinne, and to be stirred vp
to fall from God.</p>
            <p>The meanes by which <hi>Balaam</hi> cast these offences before the
Israelites: namely, by prouoking them to eate of the meate of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to idols, and commit fornication. <hi>Numb.</hi> 25. When <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi>
had vsed many waies to curse them, and could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile,
he vsed new meanes, which was, to send out most wicked
and beautifull women, to inuite them to their idole banquets,
and to fornication, and they condescended to them.</p>
            <p>Hence we gather,<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> this is the peculiar note of a false Prophet,
to draw men to offence, to cast stumbling blockes before them
in the way to saluation: for <hi>Balaam</hi> a false Prophet is noted by
this: and as <hi>Paul</hi> saith, godlinesse and true religion is a great my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie
to saluation: so false teaching is a mysterie tending to
the destruction of mens soules.</p>
            <p>So that by this note, we may iudge of all religions, both of
the Iew, and the Turke: but especially of the Papists, which
most trouble vs in this Church: for all religions whose doctrine
tendeth to stop or hinder men in the way to saluation, they be
the doctrines of diuels. The Papists religion which our ancient
folke call the old religion, is a doctrine tending to destroy
men, to ouerturne the whole morall law of God, especially to
maintaine adulterie and idolatrie. The first commandement is,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:14859:108"/>
thou shalt haue the true God onely for thy God. But the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
make moe then one, they make the creatures Gods, they
inuocate Saints, which, what is it, but to make them Gods, to
giue them his honour, seeing he alone is present euery where,
&amp; seeth the hart, and seeing they say they can merit, which none
can do formans sin, but onely God, no not Christ himself if he
were not God? Nay, they make the wooden crosse (not Christ
on the crosse) to be God, in that they call it their hope: and so
the virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> calling her our Ladie, putting hope in her,
and saying, she can commaund her Sonne in heauen, in the
matter of saluation. The second Commaundement they in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
breake, in making images of God the Father, like an old
man, the Sonne as he was on earth, and the holy Ghost in forme
of a doue, &amp; with religious worship, adore and worship Saints.</p>
            <p>They erre against the third commaundement, teaching that
a man may sweare by Saints: and the fourth, in that they make
festiual dayes of men and saints to be equal with the Sabbath of
the Lord, and take away mens libertie of labouring six dayes, to
worship their saints. As for the fift commandement, in this they
make subiects free from their lawful loyalty to their lawful Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
In the sixt, they make and appoint places to which murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
may flie and be safe, and in keeping the word from lay men
(as they call them) and so murder their soules. In the seuenth,
they maintaine stewes and houses of professed adultery, and
hold that the vncle may marry his neece or his great neece. For
the eight commandement, they ouerthrow it, in that they make
all things saleable, heauen, hell, purgatory and all, which is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
robbery. They wrong the ninth commaundement, in that
they falsly make mens writings the canon of Gods word, nay
they maintaine lying, seeing that they hold, a man being asked
of a thing he knowes (as when one hath confessed his sinnes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
askes him, he may though he know the same, say he kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
not) that is, they know not them, to tell them to you; but
that is a slender excuse. For the tenth commaundement, they
make concupiscence and lust to be no sin, and put out that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement.
So that we see, this whole religion, which is called
of old people, the old religon, is cleane new from the true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:14859:108"/>
nay it is a doctrine of diuels, seeing it tends to leade men
to destruction, and ouerturning of the whole law of God.</p>
            <p>To come to our owne church; true it is, men slaunder our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
saying it is scandalous three wayes: first, that we teach,
God creates men to cast the greatest number of them into hel &amp;
destroy them. First we answer: we hold, that though the scripture
speakes not of any certaine number, yet the elect are said to be a
small number. Secondly, the end why God created men, was not
to destroy them, but to manifest his own glory in their due, iust,
&amp; deserued damnation &amp; destructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: not that he created men to
this end, to cast them to hell. Secondly, they charge the doctrine
of our church to be a blasphemous doctrine, seeing we hold that
God decreed mans fall, and so do make him the author of sinne.
<hi>Answ.</hi> We say indeed, that God decreed mans fall, &amp; permitted
him to sin, yet teach we not, that he is the author of sin: for his wil
is double, generall and particular: in his generall wil, he decreed
to permit man to sin and fall, yet so, as in respect of God it was
good, though in respect of man euill: for as he can draw out of
darknesse light, so out of euill he can worke good to himselfe.
Secondly, there is his speciall wil, by which he wils and delights
onely in that which is good, and by this he hated mans fall. And
euen as the Magistrate hates, &amp; would not the death of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor,
yet he wils it, in that he executes the same: so the Lord
he in his general wil willed the permitting of mans fall, not as it
was euil, but as it turned to his glory and honour, and the good
of the elect. Lastly, they charge our doctrine to be a doctrine of
securitie and carnall carelesnesse, in that we teach, men may be
certaine of their saluation, and to perseuere to the end: but see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
we withal teach a man must vse the meanes, daily pray, heare
the word, receiue the sacraments, and performe all the duties of
faith and religion to the end, we teach no doctrine of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
securitie, but a doctrine of paine and trouble, which maketh
men not carelesse, but careful to come to heare, to be certaine,
and to perseuere; therefore they charge vs wrongfully in all
these.</p>
            <p>Seeing it is so great a sinne to giue offence, we must take espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
heed we giue no offence in our life, conuersation, word, or
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:14859:109"/>
deed, but so to cary our selues, that we liue vnspottedly: for if we
giue offence, we are <hi>Balaams</hi> scholers, and tread in his path. Let
vs then in our callings so cary our selues vprightly, that we giue
no offence: for wo to them by whom offences come: nay it were
better they had a mil-stone tied to them, and they cast into the
sea: for that is to plunge our brothers soule, as much as in vs li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
to the gulfe of hel. But we must rather labour to help him, to
take from him al blocks of offence; which if men would do, then
our Church should flourish: but the want of this, makes men
bold to sin, and to run on by sinne into hell. And as none must
giue offence, so we must take heed we take no offence, or be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured
to sin by mens wicked either counsel or examples: nay we
must cast off all things, which may any way hinder vs in the way
to heauen: if our right eye or hand offend, or any thing which is
most deare and neare vs, we must cut it off: if we do so, then Gods
blessing is with vs. The Israelites in the borders of the Moabites,
so long as they serued the Lord, all curses could not hurt them,
but turned to their good: but after they tooke offence by the
Moabitish women, to be inticed by them, then they came to eat
with them at their idol-feasts, and commit fornication; and then
the wrath of the Lord was vpon them. The like may be said
of vs.</p>
            <p>Seeing they vsed these meanes,<note place="margin">Vse 4.</note> when they could not preuaile
by cursing, to send their fairest women to inuite them to their
banquets, to incite them to commit fornication: we see that
temptations drawn fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the right hand, from profit and pleasure,
are most dangerous, and preuaile most with men, to bring them
to sinne and to fall from God. As a man that cannot win a citie
by force, yet by gold, by promises of profit or pleasure, getteth
the gate open: so when the diuell cannot preuaile with bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
&amp; sharp temptations, then he vseth those of the right hand,
and ouerthroweth many. We must then take heed especially of
these. For this cause <hi>Iob</hi> sacrificed daily for his children when
they had bene feasting, lest they should then haue sinned.</p>
            <p>Vers. 15. Euen so thou hast those which maintaine the doctrine
of the Nicolaitanes.</p>
            <p>In these words is the second part of the comparison, in which
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:14859:109"/>
two things: first, what the Nicolaitanes were: secondly, how
Christ was affected toward them. First, what they were in the
Church of Pergamus, is manifest in these words: <hi>Euen so,</hi> which
is a word of resemblance and relation, that may thus be descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.
They were a sect of men in the Church of Pergamus, which
maintained two damnable opinions according to the doctrine
of <hi>Balaam:</hi> first, that it was lawful to eate meate offered to idols,
euen in the idoll temples: secondly, that fornication was no sin,
as we haue shewed before.</p>
            <p>It may seeme strange, that in the dayes of the Apostles, so
soone after Christ, there should be any such which held these
damnable opinions: yet we see there were such notorious here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes.
Now that we fauour not their opinions, we must know
the grounds of their errors. For the first error: that a man might
eate meat offered to idols, euen in the very temples of idols, for
is, they might vrge Christian libertie thus. Those things which
be indifferent may be lawfully vsed: but to eate meate offered to
idols, is a thing indifferent, <hi>ergo. Ans.</hi> If these meats be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidered
in themselues, they be indifferent, and may lawfully be vsed: nay
after they be offered to idols, if they be sold in the market and
bought, they may be eaten priuately, so that we wound not any
weake Christian. But as they be prepared to be offered to idols,
vsed in idol-temples for the honour of them, we may not vse
them as prepared for the idol, vsed and offered in the temple,
and had in honour of them. Now the Nicolaitans vsed them so,
therefore vnlawfully. Secondly, they might and did alleage (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
professors of Christ outwardly) other places of scripture, as
that <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>An idoll is nothing, ergo</hi> it is no sinne to eate that
which is offered to them. <hi>Ans.</hi> An idol is nothing by nature, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
or being, nothing which hath any sparke of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
in it, but yet in mans braine it is something, seeing in mens
minds and imaginations they repute it as a God. Thirdly, they
might alleage <hi>Naamans</hi> exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, 2. <hi>King.</hi> 5. 18. who went into the
temple of Rimmon and kneeled downe there. <hi>Ans.</hi> He kneeled
not to the idol but to the King, who was there, &amp; leaned on his
hand, so that he bowed downe, not with any diuine worship to
the idol, but with ciuil worship to the Kings Maiestie: and <hi>Naa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:14859:110"/>
was in the temple, not to worship the idoll, but to make
protestation that he would serue the God of Israel, and for that
end caried as much earth as two mules could beare, to offer sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to the Lord. And if the Nicolaitans had bene so in the idol
temples, to protest that they would worship the true God, then
they had not sinned. So if any come into a place, and be present
where Masse is said, with protestation to serue the Lord, he then
allowes not of the same, but rather condemnes them for it.</p>
            <p>For the second opinion of these Nicolaitanes, that forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
was no sinne, they seemed so to proue it out of <hi>Genes.</hi>
19. 18. when the men of Sodom came to <hi>Lots</hi> house, he offereth
them his daughters: now he would not haue done it (say they) if
it had bin a sin. <hi>Ans. Lot</hi> seemes to be faulty, and not to be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in that, though he thought to escape the greater sin by the
lesser; but we must not do euil that good may come thereof. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
they might vrge, that <hi>(Hos. 1.)</hi> the Lord commanded <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sea</hi>
to take a wife and children of fornication. <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Some say it
was onely in vision, not in deed. 2. Some answer, that he did it in
speech onely, as he was a Prophet, because he prophesied to the
people, that he was as one that had such a wife and children,
which both are safe answers, and allowed. Other, more likely,
say, it was a thing not in vision and word only, but in deed and
truth done. And surely seeing the Prophets name, the womans
name, &amp; her fathers name are set downe, it seemeth to be a thing
done indeed. Neither doth a thing in speech so much affect the
people, as a deed and fact done. And the best and most auncient
interpreters, which were nearest the time of Christ, interpret it a
thing done indeed. But you may say, this was against good ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
&amp; contrary to Gods law, that the Prophet should take such
a wife. <hi>Ans.</hi> No: seeing God is aboue his law, and can dispense
with it: as when he bids <hi>Abraham</hi> kil his sonne, and he had not
sinned if he had slaine him: so here <hi>Hosea</hi> he did not sinne, hauing
a particular and speciall commaundement for the same. Neither
did he this to commit fornication, but to make of an harlot an
honest woman: and he is bidden to take the children of forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
not that he should beget any in fornication, but take her
children which she had borne in fornication. Againe, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:14859:110"/>
The Apostle speaking of two things indifferent, ioyneth forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
to them. <hi>Ans.</hi> First, he doth so, because the Gentiles
thought that it was no sinne, but indifferent: and they are there
conioyned (though fornication be not a thing indifferent) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Gentiles offended the Iewes by these three ioyntly
together.</p>
            <p>Now followeth the affection of Christ: <hi>which things I also
hate:</hi> that is, not their persons, but their errors. <hi>Which thing I
hate.</hi> First, he teacheth vs to auoide and dislike the least honour
or approbation which can be giuen to idols: for these Nicolai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes
did not honour idols, or offer to them, but came into their
temples, and (inuited by their friends) did eate of the meate of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to them: yet Christ hateth their dealing: shewing, he wold
haue vs to do the like. This also condemneth the practise of the
Church of Rome, who say, they worship not idols, yet they
kneele downe to the images of Christ, and Saints, adore them,
light candles and tapers to them, offer to them, hang costly
iewels about their neckes, cloth them with costly apparell, and
so do indeed farre more then the Nicolaitanes did; therefore
hath Christ cause to hate them much more. This also teacheth
men which trauell, to take heed that they trauell not without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
calling, to see newes, out of the limits of the Church, as to
Spaine and Italie: for then they being out of the bounds of the
true Church, offer themselues to occasions which may bring
them to idolatrie, though they hate images: for being in idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
places, they must come into their temples, and do as their
maner is, offer to idols, and kneele downe to them: which they
cannot without some approbation, whereas they should hate
the least approbation or liking of them. Then it is good for men
which trauell, to trauell within the Church, and not out, but by
some speciall calling and necessitie. Further, by this, Christ
would haue vs to hate all familiar societie with idolaters. A man
may I graunt liue with Idolaters in a ciuill course of peace: but
not to haue a speciall kind of familiaritie and amitie with them.
Now as Christ hated their idolatry, so did he their fornicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
vs example to hate fornication: first, because our bodies
are not our owne: but the bodie of a faithfull man or woman is
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:14859:111"/>
the bodie of Christ, he hath bought it, therefore we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate
and dedicate them to honour him, not Satan his enemy.
Our bodie and soule is the member of Christ, at least by professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
then we must not take the member of Christ, and make it
the member of an harlot. Our bodie and soule is the house and
temple of the holy Ghost, therefore we must keepe them faire,
pure and cleane, fit to entertaine such a guest: but they which
pollute themselues with fornication, make them sties and sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
for the diuell.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Repent quickely.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vers. 16.</note> Hauing laid downe the fault of the Church
of Pergamus, and the errors of the Nicolaitanes, here he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the remedie to escape, and after the remedie, addeth two
reasons to moue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to practise the remedie: the first, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning
the whole Church of Pergamus: the second, the Nicolaitans. In
the remedie: note, first what repentance is: secondly, why it is so
often prescribed by Christ to his Church: thirdly, to whom. To
repent properly is to change the mind from euill to good, from
sinne to God, thus, when by Gods grace a man hath this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
in his heart, not to sin as before, but in all things wholly to
do the will of God for euer. But here repentance (as commonly
in the Scripture) is taken more largely, for all the duties which go
with, or are in repentance: as first, humiliation, confession of
our sinnes, condemning our selues for them: secondly, inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
for pardon of them: thirdly, reformation of life, when a
man purposeth and indeuoreth in his life to do the will of God.
But why doth Christ so often repeate and prescribe repentance
to his Church? <hi>Ans.</hi> Not because it is a meanes to procure or
demerit saluation and reconciliation with God: for onely the
death and passion of Christ and his merits alone can do that: but
he calleth them often to this dutie, because it is the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
fruite of faith. Repentance of it selfe procureth not Gods
fauour, but it is a token of Gods fauour procured in Christ. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
because it is a path way wherein all men must walke,
which must haue pardon of their sinnes and life euerlasting. But
to whom doth Christ prescribe repentance? <hi>Ans.</hi> First, to the
whole church of Pergamus: secondly, to the Nicolaitanes. As
for the Church of Pergamus, the Ministers and people thereof,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:14859:111"/>
Christ before had commended them for worthie graces, &amp; they
had repentance before; yet Christ bids them repent still. Now
in that he prescribeth repentance still to a repentant people, it
sheweth vs, that the whole life of a Christian, is a continuall
practise of repentance, a daily and perpetuall repentance. When
one hath begunne and repented once, that is not enough; but
as euery day addeth to our age, so euery day, for our new sinnes,
we must haue new repentance. 1. <hi>Cor. 5. Paule</hi> desired them to
labour to be reconciled to God. Now <hi>(1. Cor. 6.)</hi> they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
alreadie, and had true repentance: noting that they
must labour to haue their reconciliation more increased, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the certaintie of it, and their daily offences and sinnes.
Now we must thinke, that what Christ spake to the Church of
Pergamus, is spoken to vs; and if we be in the like sin, we must
learne to performe the same dutie, which they are commanded
here. Christ moreouer prescribeth this not onely to the Church
of Pergamus, but to the Nicolaitanes, which held two damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
errors; and as they held them, no doubt they liued accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly,
yet Christ biddeth them repent. Then great and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
sinners are not barred from Gods mercie if they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.
Excellent is that of <hi>Esay:</hi> Our God is much, exceeding
much in mercie. <hi>Psalm.</hi> 130. God is much in mercie, plente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in redemption, no man which is a grieuous sinner, but God
offereth him mercie, if he will repent and lay hold on it. Among
vs in this Church are many ignorant and euill people: yet if these
will repent, the Lord offereth his mercie; though they be as
wicked as the Nicolaitanes, as <hi>Iudas,</hi> or <hi>Herode</hi> were, yet Christ
offereth his mercie and merite, if they will lay hold on it. Then
let all such wicked men breake off their sins by repentance, of
their idolatrie, blasphemie, fornication, and humble themselues
with <hi>Iob</hi> in dust and ashes, and they shall find mercie. But we
must not abuse Gods mercie to presumption, but be sure, that
though thy sinnes be as scarlet or crimson, or as scarlet which
can take no other colour, yet there is mercie in store to helpe
thee, if thou repent. This doctrine may be taught to malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,
not to imbolden them in sinne, but to assure them, that
if they repent at any time, the Lord will heare them: yea though
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:14859:112"/>
a man fall often into the same sinne (which is dangerous) yet if
he haue grace to repent, Gods fountaine of mercie is not
drawne dry, but still he hath in store; onely they must repent: for
if they looke to haue the merit of Christ, Christ looketh to
haue their repentance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Else I will come against thee shortly.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verse 16.</note> After the remedy followes
a two-fold reason, to inforce and set an edge on the former do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine:
first, concerning the Church of Pergamus: secondly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Nicolaitanes, holding and practising of these two
sinnes.</p>
            <p>The first cause and reason, <hi>If not, I will come, &amp;c.</hi> that is, if thou
do not repent for these sinnes, want of zeale, and other thy par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
sinnes, I will come to thee shortly, to punish and plague
thee; for the Lord (as I haue said) he cometh either in mercy, or
in iudgement. Now if they repent not, Christ saith he will come
to them, not to help them, but to execute iudgement on them, to
punish them. So <hi>Esay.</hi> 30. 27.</p>
            <p>Christ saith not, <hi>I will, but I come to thee:</hi> expressing the time
to come, by the time present: to certifie them, that if they repent
not, he will most surely come, as certainly as if he did now come
to them.</p>
            <p>In this threatning we see a generall rule to be learned of all,
that if any Church or people will not repent, then the Lord will
come to them in iudgement to punish them, as by sundry exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
we may see the Lord hath done. In our Church and people,
though some do repent, yet for the common body of the people
they do not, but they liue in sinne and ignorance, hauing no care
to know Gods will; and if they know it, yet no care to obey the
same, but they for the most part continue in their sinnes. Seeing
their case is such, who could not out of Gods word, in good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
foretell and prophesie (by this generall rule) that God
will come against them shortly, to take vengeance on them, and
to plague them? Though we may flatter our selues, and think all
is well, yet we must assure our selues he cannot but come, vnlesse
we repent. This should then moue vs all to repent, to humble
our selues, condemne our selues for our sins, craue pardon, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
newnesse of life, desire the Lord that he would in Christ be
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:14859:112"/>
reconciled to each of vs, and promise and performe euer after
new obedience. If we doe repent daily for new and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
sinnes, then we shall stay the Lord, preuent his coming to
punish vs: but if we go on in sinne, assure our selues the Lord is
true of his promise, he will come in iudgement against vs.</p>
            <p>The second reason is directed to the Nicolaitans, <hi>With whom
he wil fight,</hi> that is, be at enmitie with them, and declare the same
in waging battell with them, seeing they hold these two grosse
and damnable <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>inions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>With the sword of my mouth.</hi> That is, the preaching and publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing
of the word, the ministery and dispensation of the law
and the Gospell among men. In which words he still alludeth to
the doing of <hi>Balaam;</hi> as in the doctrine, so in the end and scope:
for when <hi>Balaam</hi> cursed the children of Israel, the Angell stood
against him, to stay and hinder him that he should not go: he
seeing the Angel, fel downe and worshipped the Angel, that is,
the son of God Christ Iesus: but after, seeing he would not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained,
but went to curse the people, he perished by the sword.
<hi>Numb.</hi> 31. Euen so Christ dealeth with the Nicolaitanes, as he
did with <hi>Balaam:</hi> seeing they went on still in wickednes, he figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth with them to reclaime them from their wicked wayes, he
withstands them with the sword of his mouth, but if they will
needs go on, then he fights, not to reclaime them, but to slay
them, as he did <hi>Balaam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But I will fight against thee,</hi> not kill thee, for Christ he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
not at the first to slay them, but to withstand them, and if it
might be to reclaime them: but after, if they would not be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
and stayed, to destroy them, as he did <hi>Balaam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seeing Christ comes against the wicked and impenitent,<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> not
to kill them, but to withstand and hinder them at the first: we see
his wonderfull patience toward sinners and wicked men. So
<hi>Gen.</hi> 6. the Lord striued and wrestled with the old world one
hundred and twentie yeares, that they might repent, by the
preaching of <hi>Noah:</hi> and <hi>Genes.</hi> 16. he bare with the Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,
till their sinnes were come to the full: and he bare with the
Aegyptians many hundred yeares: nay the Iewes after they had
killed Christ, were not straight way consumed, but the Lord:
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:14859:113"/>
suffered them fiftie yeares. So the Lord suffereth sinners, the
blasphemer, adulterer, and cruell man to liue, cometh often to
them by his word, not to kill them at first, but to winne and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime
them. And so euery one of vs feeleth his mercie, in that he
might destroy and cast vs into hell, so soone as we be borne: yet
he suffereth vs to liue, some twentie, thirtie, or fortie yeares, that
we might haue a time and space to repent, and turne to Christ.
Then it is our dutie to take this occasion, to take this time of
Gods patience, not to let it slip, but haste to re<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ntance ere the
time of patience be ended. The old world had one hundred and
twentie yeares of patience, but neglecting it they perished, the
time of mercie being ended. Seeing they wold not heare <hi>Noah,</hi>
therefore they be now in prison,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 3. 20.</note> that is, in hell. Againe, in that
Christ saith, he will come thus against the Nicolaitanes, we see,
that they which repent not, haue God for their enemie to fight
against them, (and for this cause, sinne is called rebellion against
God.) Now this is a most fearefull thing, to haue God mans
enemie: let vs then repent, that we may haue God a friend to vs,
as he was to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and as Christ was to his disciples.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I will come to thee, and fight against thee.</hi> Here Christ shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
he is the true Pastor and Doctor of the Church, he can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide
the word aright, giue promises to them to whom they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long,
and threatnings to whom they belong: for iudgements
and promises must not be propounded to all equally, but there
must be regard had of time, place, and persons. For iudgements,
some be temporall, which must be threatned to the penitent:
some eternal, and those to the impenitent. So promises are to be
made, not hand ouer head, but with respect, condition, limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and restraint. To propound either promises or threatnings
otherwise, is not to deuide the word aright.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>With the sword of my mouth:</hi> that is, the ministerie of the word,
not to kill them, but to resist and withstand them which repent
not: and this is the chiefe end and scope of the preaching of the
word, to winne men from their sinnes and wicked wayes; and if
they will not repent, then to drowne them in perdition and to
slay them. In this Church of England, and in this congregation,
we haue had the Gospell this 36 yeares published and preached
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:14859:113"/>
to vs, the Lord hath rebuked vs for our sinnes, and yet we still a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
in them without repentance: the Lord still cometh against
vs with the sword of his mouth, stil checkes vs for our sinnes, and
controlleth the wicked idolater, Atheist, fornicator &amp; cruel man,
he stands to fight against such, face to face, stands with his naked
sword in the ministery of the word, to reclaime them from their
sins: if they wil not, to wound them to the heart, and to kil them.
Now we hearing our sins reprooued, we should feare and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
fall downe as <hi>Balaam</hi> did: and seeing the Lord in the word
preached, stands with his sword in his hand, ready to slay vs if
we wil not be stayed, we should be afraid. If we heare of an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to come against vs, how will euery one quake for feare: shall
we feare the shaking sword of a mortal man, and not the bloudy
sword of the euerliuing God? Shall we resist him and go on,
though he fight against vs? Alas it is not wisedome to striue with
God, for then he will hacke vs to peeces: but we must heare him,
and submit our selues to his good will &amp; pleasure: and if we wil
not, the same sword of God shall be an instrument to pierce our
hearts to death. Then when we heare the Minister speaking to
vs, we must know that the Lord speaketh to vs, fights against our
sins, and not contemne him. Againe, we see the word of God is
called the sword of Christs mouth, not only because he once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
it, but because it dayly proceeds fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him in the preaching
of the same by the Ministers.</p>
            <p>Then we see this is an excellent thing, that the Ministers of
Christ lawfully called, they be that mouth of Christ, from which
his sword proceeds. So <hi>Paul</hi> calleth them the Ambassadours of
Christ to deliuer his word. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19.</p>
            <p>Then they which be in the schooles of the Prophets,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> and they
also which be in the way to the same, must learne to thinke reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
and highly of it, not contemne it, and thinke it a base cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling:
for to be a Lawyer or Phisition, hath not this priuiledge, to
be called the mouth of Christ, as the Ministers haue. Againe,
seeing they be the mouth of Christ, Ministers must speake the
word of Christ, as they are perswaded in conscience Christ
would speake the same if he were present. Euen as Ambassadors,
who deliuer their masters will, in that maner and those words
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:14859:114"/>
which they thinke he would himselfe: which if we did, then we
should not haue that humane kind of preaching, partly in
Greeke, Latin, &amp; English, mingled with testimonies and senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of men: for Christ would neuer preach so, neither did his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
or Prophets vse it. Furthermore, seeing the Minister law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
called is the mouth of Christ, we must take heed, that we
seeing a mortall man, sinfull like to vs, deliuer the word, that we
contemne it not for his sake, but receiue the word as it is indeed
the power of God, though it come from a mortall man. So <hi>Paul</hi>
commends the Thessalonians, who receiued his doctrine as the
word of the euer liuing God. Besides, seeing Christ carieth his
Scepter in his mouth, not in his hand, we see his kingdom is not
of this world; not carnall but spirituall, he gouerneth and ruleth
his Church and people by the sword of his mouth, the eternall
word of God, published and preached by sinfull man like to vs.</p>
            <p>This sheweth the abuse of that sword, which the Pope, the
Vicar of Christ, chalengeth: for he will haue both swords, ciuil
and Ecclesiasticalls surely he is not the Vicar, and in the roome
of Christ, for Christ was content onely with the spirituall
sword.</p>
            <p>Now followeth the conclusion of the Epistle, containing
two parts: the first a commandement, <hi>Let him which hath an eare
heare:</hi> the second, a promise, <hi>To him which ouercometh, will I giue
to eate of the Manna, &amp;c.</hi> Of the first I haue spoken before. The
end and scope of this commaundement, is to stir vp the Church
to attention, to marke the things propounded. The first speciall
point what is commaunded to be heard, is, the word of God,
which must not be heard with a bare and simple hearing, but
with knowledge, faith, beleefe, and obedience in practise.</p>
            <p>Seeing he commaunds this hearing to all men, we see it is the
ordinance of God, all men in the Church should frequent ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
where this word of God is propounded and taught by
plaine and simple men, that they may better learne their dutie.
At a good time men wil come to the Church, though they come
not halfe a yeare after: but the ordinance of Christ is, that men
should daily at all lawfull occasions frequent sermons, and come
to the congregation: and if we be his sheepe, we will heare his
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:14859:114"/>
voice: <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. &amp; desire to heare his word, taught by his mouth.
<hi>Mat.</hi> 16. the word of God is called the key of the kingdome of
heauen: now as necessarie it is to haue the key to open heauen,
as to haue his soule brought thither. <hi>Paule</hi> calleth the doctrine
of the Gospell, the word of reconciliation, because the same by
Gods grace reconcileth vs to him, who being his enemies, are
made by it to be in his fauour. Then we must come to heare it
daily, not at Christmas or such times alone, for this is to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
those dayes aboue the Lords day. But men corrupt &amp; fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
say for themselues: Tush, if God, or Christ, or his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
wold preach to vs, we wold come: but when men speake to
vs, being sinfull and like our selues, we will not. <hi>Ans.</hi> It is the
will and ordinance of God, that his word should be published
and preached to man, by man like himselfe: for since <hi>Adams</hi> fall,
man could not abide to heare the Maiestie of God: the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites
seeing but a glimmering of Gods glorie, could not abide
it, but said: <hi>Speake to vs by Moses, Exod.</hi> 19. And he will haue
his word preached by sinfull man, to trie mans obedience and
humilitie, how he will receiue and obey the word of God deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
by man. Againe, he doth it, to make loue betweene man
and man, when one man speaketh the word of God to another.
Then are they presumptuous persons, who dare oppose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
against Gods most holy ordinance and will. Againe, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
say they haue the Bible, containing the Sermons of Christ,
the Apostles and Prophets, and who can make better Sermons
then they? now seeing they haue these at hand, they need not
come to the Church. But let these consider, that as it is the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
and will of God to haue the Bible, so will he haue it
expounded by man in the Church, that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might vnderstand it,
and so make vse of it in their liues. As for some others, they will
not come to the Church, but hauing a iourney, (as they say)
they can serue God on their horse backe, or in the way, as well,
and with as good a heart as the best in the Church: but let these
heare the word of God, by the wisest man, <hi>Salomon, Pro. 28. 16.
He which turneth his eare from the law:</hi> that is, from hearing the
word of God, <hi>his prayers are abhominable.</hi> And if he turne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
God, God will turne from him: and if men be wearie of his
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:14859:115"/>
word, God will be wearie of their seruice, of all their prayers,
and other seruice where or whatsoeuer. Lastly, many thinke they
haue knowledge enough, no man can teach them that they
know not alreadie. But the preaching of the word serueth not
onely to beget knowledge, but to increase the same: and also
to beget in man obedience to his knowledge: so that these,
though they seeme to be the wisest, are most foolish: no man, no
not the greatest learned, but he hath knowledge in part, and it
may be increased: and say, he get not more knowledge, yet he
may by the word deliuered by a plaine and simple man, be
brought to obedience of that he knoweth. Another principall
dutie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded in the conclusion, is reading the word, both in
publike and priuate, that so we may be prepared to heare and
obey the same. So Christ <hi>(Luk. 10. 26.) What readest thou?</hi> he
taketh it for graunted, that the young man could reade the
lawe. <hi>Esay.</hi> 5. 13. for want of Gods word and knowledge, the
people of God went into captiuitie. And yet we see among vs
many families which come to church, heare the word, nay, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
the Sacraments, not knowing the thing assured in them:
neither hauing a Bible to reade, nor procuring others if they
cannot: yet many haue a Bible lying on their cupbord, but vse
it not. The tables, cards, and dice, they be well vsed and worne,
but the booke of God lyeth couered with dust. Many will haue
the booke of Satutes, that they may know their dutie, but none
careth to haue the Statutes of God, to teach them to range their
vnbridled affections within the compasse of the same.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And to him which ouercommeth.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vers. 17.</note> Here is the second part of
the conclusion: namely, the promise, which is the same in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
with those annexed with the two former Epistles. In this
promise, note two points: first, to whom it is made: second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
what is promised. First, the persons to whom promise is
made: namely, they which ouercome. To ouercome (as before)
is to beleeue, to put all our trust and confidence in Christ alone,
and to get victorie against all our spirituall enemies.</p>
            <p>That we may ouercome so, we must do two things: first, we
must denie our selues, and all that is in vs, &amp; put our whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in Christ alone: secondly, we must maintaine true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:14859:115"/>
and a good conscience in all things, to our last end: and
this is indeed to ouercome all our spirituall enemies.<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> Now see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God maketh this promise to them which ouercome, we
must labour to come to this estate, that so we may be partakers
of the promise.</p>
            <p>The second point, is the thing promised: <hi>He will giue him to
eate of the hidden Manna, &amp;c.</hi> The thing promised is a threefold
gift of God: first, to eate of that Manna: secondly, he shall haue
a white stone: thirdly, a new name written in the same white
stone. Which three signifie our election, vocation, iustification,
sanctificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; glorification; and to be the children of God. To
come to the first: <hi>to eate of the hidden Manna.</hi> Manna signifieth
properly that food which God gaue the children of Israell from
heauen to feed them in the wildernesse, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 98. For the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie
of it, it is called the wheat of heauen, and the foode of
strong men, or of Angels: in forme, it was like Coreander seed,
white and sweet,<note place="margin">Numb. 11. 7.</note> as <hi>Moses</hi> saith, by which the Lord fed them in
the wildernesse fortie yeares from heauen, to teach them, man
liueth not by bread onely, but by the word of God. And this is
thought of many to be the same white Manna sold in shops, but
I stand not on that, and it is to be doubted. But this Manna sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth
another food, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. it is the spirituall foode which
our fathers did eate: namely, the food of our souls, that is, Christ
the true Manna, and bread of life which came from heauen. <hi>Iohn</hi>
6. sheweth, that Christ is that food, and spirituall meate of our
soules, feeding vs to eternall life. <hi>Ob.</hi> But how can Christ the
Sonne of God become our meat and food? <hi>Ans.</hi> By these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions:
first, Christ is food, not in respect of his doctrine, or his
miracles, or in regard of his death, passion or obedience alone,
but in regard of himselfe, as he is Christ, God and man. And
here he is called the Lord of life, first, in regard of himselfe, then
in regard of his benefites. The second conclusion: he is our food
not as he lay in the cratch, or as he is now in heauen, but as he
died, was buried, rose, &amp; suffered the paines of hell: dead Christ,
crucified Christ, he is our food of life; for fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his death cometh
our life. The third conclusion; Christ is food, not in regard of
his Godhead or Deitie, but in regard of his manhood: I say, of
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:14859:116"/>
his manhood, not simply in it selfe, but as it is in the Godhead,
subsisting by the Deitie: as he is God and man, so is his bodie
and bloud our food: yet Christ is not a bodily and sensible food
to be receiued with our hand, mouth, and into our stomacke,
but he is a spirituall food, to be receiued onely by the hand of
faith into the stomacke of our soules, whereby they be fed to
eternall life. And thus we eate him, when we beleeue, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
our selues, that he was dead, buried, and crucified for vs in
particular.</p>
            <p>Seeing Christ crucified is the bread of life,<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> and the spirituall
Manna whereon our soules must feed, we must long and hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
after Christ spiritually, as truly and sensibly as we do after
meate and drinke. We see when a man is famished, he will eate
his owne flesh, teare and pull it off his armes to satisfie hunger.
Now shall we thus pull our owne flesh, and shall we not spend
all we haue, to haue this food of our soules? In the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of the stomacke be two things: first, there is a paine in the
nether part and bottome of the stomacke, and from this there
cometh a strong and hungrie appetite, which lasteth till the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and appetite be filled and satisfied. So we should feele a paine
in our hearts, rising from the feare of Gods wrath for our sinnes
and offences: and withall we must feele an hungring and lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
appetite to haue this paine taken away, to haue this appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite
satisfied, which is onely by that food, of the bodie and bloud
of Christ. Secondly, there is besides that paine, an appetite and
longing after meate, and an earnest desire to be satisfied: now,
as the stomacke longeth after meate, so should the stomacke of
our soules (feeling a paine) long, and haue an earnest appetite
to be filled and satisfied in some sort, neuer quiet till we haue
got the bodie and bloud of Christ (which is the true food of our
soules) to satisfie our hungrie appetite. But our case (for the
most part) is miserable, we haue a dead flesh growne ouer our
hearts, they be not touched with any paine of our wants and
miseries. But we must labour to see our hunger and want of
Christ: for as they which be thus hungrie shall be fed, so they
which be full, shall be sent emptie away. Oh, they be blessed
which hunger after Christ, they shall haue the bread of life, and
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:14859:116"/>
drinke of the well of life. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.</p>
            <p>Seeing Christ is the bread of life,<note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> the true Manna, signified by
that in the wildernesse: we see the madnesse of most men in the
world: who seeke not for this spirituall Manna of the soule,
which is farre better then that in the wildernesse: but we like the
Israelites delight in onions and garlike, and the flesh-pots of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.
And are not we as prophane as they, seeing we labor much
to get earthly Manna, temporall food, riches, pleasure, &amp;c. but
neuer seek to haue Christ the food of our soules, the bread of life.
Yet these which do so, be the wise me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the world, we cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of credit, and happiest me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but they be indeed prophane <hi>Esawes,</hi>
preferring this temporall food before Christ the food of eternal
life. We must then labour to detest this abhominable propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
seeing it is the very defacing of religion. But Christ shall
take it in the highest disgrace, when he seeth vs preferre bread
which perisheth, before this precious and eternall food of our
soules. And here in that Christ meaneth by Manna, not corporal
food, but himselfe, his owne body and blood (for that corporall
foode was but a signe of this): we see the signe in the sacrament
is put for the thing signified, Manna for the body of Christ.</p>
            <p>Christ addeth <hi>the hidden Manna,</hi> to put a distinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the earthly Manna, which the Israelites, and all
might see, feele, and eate, and Christ who is the hidden Manna,
and whom euery one cannot see. It is called hidden, first
because no man by nature can haue this foode, no naturall man
can see, will, or desire it: secondly, because God reuealeth not
this spirituall food, namely Christ, effectually to all men. <hi>Math.</hi>
11. 25. The wise and prudent cannot know it, it is reuealed
onely to Gods children.</p>
            <p>Seeing Christ is the hidden Manna,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> we see the estate of men
in the world, yea in the Church of God, they know not Christ
the true bread of life, they feele no want of this food because
they know it not: for a man cannot know truly what food is till
he stand in need of it, &amp; feele the want of it: nay, not onely the
people, but Preachers, though they know Christ in a mentall
knowledge, yet they know not him as they should, they feele no
want of Christ to be their Sauiour to deliuer them from the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:14859:117"/>
wrath of God, to feed their starued and famished soules, and to
deliuer them from the gulfe of hell.</p>
            <p>Then we must not content our selues with knowledge swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
in the braine, but labour to know our wants, to feele our
misery, to seeke to haue Christ the food of our soules, to deliuer
vs from the misery and wretched estate we are in; by it to labour
to get but one drop of bloud to satisfie our hungry and starued
soules. And as one which is starued with hunger would seeke to
haue meate, so we must haue experimentall knowledge, that we
can say in conscience, I see and feele how I want Christ to feed
my soule.</p>
            <p>Seeing Christ is the hidden Manna, God offereth him not to
all men in generall, for then he should not be hid as he is from
many, therefore there is no vniuersal election, no vniuersal grace
offered effectually to all men in particular.</p>
            <p>The second gift is, <hi>a white stone:</hi> where Christ borroweth a
phrase of speech from the Gentiles, to whom he wrote. The
Gentiles vsed these stones in iudgement; for when men were
iudged, the Iudges gaue them either a white stone, which was a
token of absolution, or a blacke stone, which was a signe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.
Secondly, they vsed these stones, to trie whether
such a day or such should be luckie (as they say) or vnluckie: for
if they tooke a white stone out of their vessel, then it was a token
of good lucke; if a black, then of bad. Now here it is vsed for the
first.</p>
            <p>Christ promiseth a white stone,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> that is, pardon and absoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from sinnes, and from the punishment of sinne, euen eternall
damnation. To them which ouercome, beleeue, labour to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
and defend faith and a good conscience, let these go on to
the end, for they shall haue this white stone. Now then, if any
would know whether he haue pardon and absolution of his sins,
here is the note and marke; if he beleeue in Christ, labour to
maintaine faith and a good conscience, then he hath this white
stone promised him. Then we must labour for these, that so the
other may be sealed to vs.</p>
            <p>The third gift is, <hi>A new name written in the same stone.</hi> This
name is to be Gods child: so the same Apostle expounds it, 1.
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:14859:117"/>
               <hi>Iohn 3. Behold what great loue God sheweth vs, euen to be called his
sonnes:</hi> this is the name he giueth to them which ouercome, to be
called his sonnes, and heires with Christ.</p>
            <p>Now seeing God giueth this new name to his children, it must
not be an idle name: but the Lord giueth with it a new conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
whereby we are made the sonnes and heires of God. So when
<hi>Abram</hi> was new named <hi>Abraham,</hi> it was for a speciall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;
for then he began to be the father of the faithfull. When
<hi>Iacob</hi> was called <hi>Israel,</hi> it was for a speciall end. So we hauing a
new name, must haue a new condition, which is, to be called the
sonnes and heires of God in Christ. Now this is a most excellent
prerogatiue, for then we haue Christ our elder brother, and our
fellow heire, God our father, the Angels to defend and guide vs,
all things and meanes of this life to our benefite, Gods speciall
prouidence to guide vs, and being Gods childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, our sins are no
sins, but a meanes to come to felicitie: and our death is no death,
but a litle doore to passe to life: this is the new condition God
giueth with our new name.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Written in the white stone:</hi> That is, in the pledge of abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution;
for here the white stone and new name go together: for
looke whom he absolueth, he giueth a new name and new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition:
for he which hath his sinnes pardoned, is a new creature,
a new man: the white stone and new name go together, and are
written in each other. Then men must haue them both, and not
as most do, say they hope Christ is their Sauiour, he will pardon
their sinnes, and yet continue in them, &amp; take occasion by that
to sinne: for Christ if he giue the white stone, that is, pardon of
sinne, he giueth with it a new name, and a new condition of
life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Which no man knoweth.</hi> Some might obiect: Doth he giue
men new names, why then do we not call them by their names?
<hi>Answ.</hi> He saith, no man knoweth it but he which hath it, that is
in that maner and certainty as he which receiues it, for no
man can know or discerne it: then men must not thinke strange
though be be not called by this new name. The world knoweth
vs not. 1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3. 1.</p>
            <p>Now in that he which hath this new name,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> knowes it, and
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:14859:118"/>
seeth that he is the child of God, and fellow-heire with Christ,
that he is called, iustified, sanctified, and that none knowes it but
he which hath receiued it. This co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>futes the Papists, who say, they
know it, but not certainly, but in hope, and by coniecture and
probabilitie. But we see he knowes it certainly, infallibly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt, for he knowes it better then any other: other men
know it by coniecture, but he knoweth it certainly.</p>
            <p>No man knowes this new name so certainly &amp; infallibly, and
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> within, as he which receiues the same, for no man can deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
of the faith, adoption or calling of any, but himself: for that
is proper to God to search the heart. This must stay our censure
and iudgement, to iudge men to be hypocrites, to condemne
either the better or bad sort of men, for we know not a mans
heart, his faith is but knowne to God and himselfe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> How farre may we iudge of anothers state of saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
<hi>Answ.</hi> We iudge of another mans estate, either certainly or
not: certainly, as when one iudgeth, and sets downe certainly
and resolutely, that such men are elected to saluation without all
doubt: but this is proper to God, no man can know the spirit of
man but God and the man himself, and so farre as it pleaseth him
to reueale the same to some of his children; as to <hi>Dauid</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed
the damnation and reiection of some, for which cause he
prayeth for their destruction. Now besides this, there is
the iudgement of charitie, when we iudge of another as cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
moueth vs: now charitie maketh a man iudge the best. This
charitie hath two parts, first it is not to despaire: secondly it is to
iudge of a mans saluation vndoubtedly, to be perswaded of it
certainly. We must not despaire, though we see men liue in sin.
And we must iudge certainly of mens saluation, and without
doubt that they be called effectually, in that they testifie their
faith, by their obedience, not that we can set down certainly, but
we must in charitie iudge so of them. And this is charitie in the
highest degree, when we iudge that such a one is the child of
God by the fruites of his faith.</p>
            <p>Here again they of the Church of Rome are deceiued, making
the Church to haue this note and property to be visible, but not
visibilitie: but election, adoption, and faith are the principall
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:14859:118"/>
markes of the Church. Now these cannot be seene, onely the
fruites of them may.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And to the Angell.</hi> Here beginneth the fourth particular E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle.
The end &amp; scope of these words, is to certifie the church
of Thyatyra, that <hi>Iohn</hi> had a speciall commandement and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
from God, first, to write this Epistle: secondly, to certifie
all Churches to the end of the world, that he had a commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and calling from God to write, not onely this Epistle, but
this whole booke: and for that cause this is seuen times repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<hi>To the Angell, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Epistle beginneth here: <hi>These things write, &amp;c.</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth
almost to the end of this Chapter: in it note three
parts: first, a Preface: secondly, a Proposition: thirdly, a Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
The preface or entrance in the eighteenth verse, all which
were in the former Chapter: verses 5. 14. 15. <hi>These things saith.</hi>
In the preface: note first, in whose name it is written: namely in
the name of Christ. The cause why his name is in the Preface, is
set downe before. Christ is described by three arguments: first,
he is the Son of God: secondly, his eyes are like a flame of fire:
thirdly, his feet like fine brasse. Christ is here said to be the Son
of God. In the former Chapter he was called the sonne of man:
here the Sonne of God. By God, he meaneth not the Godhead
as it is absolutely or common to all the three persons: but by it
is meant the Father, who when he is conferred with any person
in the Trinitie, is called God, not that he is more God, then
the Sonne and holy Ghost; or that they be not equall, but for
order, in that he is the first person, &amp; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him the Godhead is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
to the Sonne and holy Ghost. How Christ is called
the Sonne of God, we may know by these two rules: first, Christ
is the Sonne of the Father, not in respect of his Godhead, or as
he is God, but in respect of his person: and in respect of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
he is begotten of the Father before all worlds. For the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
of Christ the Sonne, is not begotten, or begetteth not, nor
proceedeth, but he hath one and the same Godhead with the
Father: therefore it no more begetteth, or is begotten, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
then his. The second rule, Christ is the Sonne of the
Father, not by creation, as the Angels and <hi>Adam,</hi> nor by grace
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:14859:119"/>
as true beleeuers in Christ; but by nature, in that he is begotten
of the substance of the Father before all worlds. Because the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated to him from himself, his whole Godhead and
nature: and by this communication of the Godhead to his Son
wholly, he is said to beget the Sonne, and he is said to be begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
of the Father. The end why Christ is called the Sonne
of God, is, namely, to stirre vp in this Church of Thyatira, care
and diligence, reuerence and attention in marking and obeying
the things of this Epistle, seeing that he which teacheth them
is the Sonne of God: teaching vs in their example, when we
heare the word read or preached, we must haue attention, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
care and feare, seeing it is the Sonne of God which spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
to vs. When <hi>Pilate</hi> was condemning Christ, and heard he
was the Sonne of God, he was affraid. Shall an heathen man
which knew not God, feare to heare of Christ the Son of God:
and shall not we tremble to heare him speake to vs himselfe? At
the voice of Christ the mountaines melted, and the rockes claue
asunder, and shall not our stonie and rockie hearts tremble to
heare him speake to vs out of his word?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His eyes were like a flame of fire.</hi> We must not take these words
literally, but as in the former Chapter: for Christ is set out as he
appeared in vision to <hi>Iohn.</hi> By his fierie eye is meant, first, that
in him is infinite wisedome, he seeth all things, he knoweth by
his fierie and piercing eye, all things, present, past, and to come.
Secondly, it signifieth his vigilancie and watchfulnesse ouer his
Church, and euery particular member of the same, for these two
ends: first, to preserue and protect his own children, secondly to
take reuenge and punishment on his enemies. Thirdly, by his fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erie
eye, is signified his anger against sinnes and sinners. Christ
is said to haue fierie eyes, to teach vs, that he can discerne secret
and hidden sinnes: for in this Chapter we find, that certaine men
in this Church were giuen to fornication and idolatrie, close
and hidden sinnes. Now here he is said to haue fierie eyes, to
shew them, he seeth these secret sinnes; he knoweth their hearts,
much more their sinfull workes, and will punish them.</p>
            <p>Then by this we haue a good remedie against all secret sins.<note place="margin">Vse.</note>
The nature of man is, for shame, and feare of punishment,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:14859:119"/>
to abstaine from outward crimes: but being out of the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
of men, he will breake the commandement of the first and
second Table, without any care or conscience; and this euery
mans conscience can best testifie: that though he can abstaine
from outward sinnes for shame and punishment, yet he will co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
secret sinnes. But these men should remember, that though
they be out of the presence of men, yet they stand in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of Christ, he seeth them, his fierie eye pierceth to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
thoughts and affections: and though they may bleare the
eyes of men, yet they cannot bleare this fierie eye of Christ. If
euery man would remember this, the fornicator, blasphemer,
or any sinner, it would be a good meanes to bridle and stay the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
from committing sinnes, both open and hidden.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And his feet like fine brasse.</hi> He is said to haue brazen feet, to
shew his strength and power, by which he ouercame and brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the head of the serpent on the crosse, and fully vanquished
hell, death and sinne by his death, and also doth subdue sinne
and Satan, and put them vnder not onely his brazen foot, but
vnder the feet of his seruants and members.</p>
            <p>The end why he is said to haue feet of brasse here in this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle,
is to terrifie certaine wicked persons in this Church, as
fornicators, and idolaters, nay the whole Church of Thyatira,
which by these wicked men, were in daunger to be drawne that
way.</p>
            <p>This then may be a remedie for all loose liuers:<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> namely, to
consider of Christs brazen feet, to thinke that Christ our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
is in the midst of the Church, walketh there, and that he
hath a foote of brasse to trample and tread all his enemies to
powder, and to destroy them. The want of this, is the cause why
men lie in sinne, and heape sinne vpon sinne without care, or
conscience, or any feare.</p>
            <p>The second part of the Epistle is the Proposition, wherein is
propounded the substance and matter of the Epistle. It hath two
parts: first, a praise: secondly, a dispraise or rebuke. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation,
in the 19. verse: the dispraise, in the 20. verse. First,
she is commended generally, <hi>I know thy workes:</hi> secondly, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,
for many duties and vertues.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:14859:120"/>
               <hi>I know thy workes:</hi> that is, I see and allow thy workes and
wayes. The end why he alleadgeth and repeateth these words,
is to stirre vp the hearts of his seruants, to consider of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
For Christ before hath fierie eyes, and here he saith, <hi>I know
thy workes,</hi> to make this consideration, to sinke more deepely,
and imprint it more throughly.</p>
            <p>In the second part he commendeth her for many duties and
vertues: first, <hi>loue:</hi> secondly, <hi>seruice:</hi> thirdly, patience: fourthly,
faith and increase of godlinesse. First, she is commended for
<hi>loue:</hi> that is, loue to man, not to God, for, for that she is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
after in the duties to God. But by loue and seruice is meant
duties to man, performed by man to man. To know this loue
better, note three points: first, what it is: secondly, the property
of true loue to man: thirdly, how it must be practised toward
men. Loue to man is a gift of Gods spirit, whereby a man is
well affected to his neighbour for Gods sake. First, loue is the
gift of the Spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 25. Secondly, it is a gift whereby a man
is well affected to his neighbour, that is, to reioyce at his good,
to defend, to seeke and wish his good; yea, to be grieued with
his hurt and miserie, and withall to haue bowels of compassion
to helpe him in his hurt and miserie. Thirdly, it must be to our
neighbour, not by dwelling or habitation, but to them which
be our brethren in nature, haue the same flesh with vs, &amp; beare
the same image of God. Then all men, as they be men, are our
neighbours, though they dwell at the worlds end, whether be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuer
or infidell, friend or foe, to these we must be wel affected.
Fourthly, it must be for Gods sake: for God must first absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and principally be loued, and man for him: so that our loue to
man is a fruit of our loue to God, springing and descending from
it. As for the propertie of our loue to man, it must be feruent,
and that in two things: first, if need require, euery man is bound
in the compasse of his calling, to lay downe his life for his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and for his neighbour, 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 16. Secondly, it must be
feruent towards our enemies: in the world there is much hatred,
malice and iniuries. Now we must loue those persons from who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
these come, and loue must be feruent, that these like water do
not quench it. And for the practise of our loue to man, the rule is,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:14859:120"/>
that we loue him as our selues: as we loue and wish well to our
selues heartily, so must we loue and wish well to him. This is the
law of nature, to do to another as we would haue him to do to
vs: yea this is the law of God; do to all men as you would haue
them do to you. Is a man to sell? the diuell offereth him gaine, if
he wil lie. Now consider by thine owne law, wouldest thou haue
another to deceiue thee by lying? no surely: then deceiue not
thy neighor by false weights, wares, or otherwise. By these three
things we see for what this Church was commended. This loue
were to be wished in vs, but alas it waxeth cold, euery man is a
louer of himselfe, seeketh his owne good, no man his brothers:
euery man spends his labor, wit, and his calling to help himself,
no man to do good to others, to help the common good, or the
good of the Church, but to the hurt or hindering of others: for
men think they may make the best of their owne, sell as deare as
they can: but we should employ all our callings, if we had true
loue, not onely to our owne good, but the good of others, euen
the common good of the towne, country, or church. When men
come to the Church, to heare the word, to pray, to receiue the
sacrament, then they seeme to shew great loue of God, but look
into their callings, there is no loue of their brethren: which she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
they haue no true but an outward loue of God, seeing
they loue not their neighbour, liue by iniustice, seeking to fley
him, and draw out his very bloud by cruell dealing, by griping,
pilling, and polling: now there cannot be true loue of God,
where this loue of our neighbour is wanting. 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 21.</p>
            <p>The second vertue for which this church is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended, is <hi>seruice.</hi>
In this place it is a vertue and work of loue, whereby a Christian
man becomes a seruant to euery man for his good. This is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
and described, <hi>Heb. 6. 10. Paul Gal.</hi> 6. commaunds vs to
do seruice one to another by loue. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. loue seekes not her
owne, but the good of others. So Christ <hi>(Iohn 13.)</hi> commaunds
his to be seruants one to another, in those good things which
God giueth vs. As we must do them good in all we can, so one
speciall dutie here mentioned, is to be ready to releeue (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
our abilitie) the want of the Church, for we must haue first
loue and charitie, then seruice as a braunch springing from loue.
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:14859:121"/>
               <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 10. which is when we are ready to bestow our goods or
gifts, which God giueth vs, to the good of the Church, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the godly in the Church. This were to be wished in England,
but it is not, seeing the richest sort bestow their goods in hawks,
hounds, beares, buls, dogs, and other their pleasure and pastime:
but when any comes to be bestowed on the poore, then they be
strait handed, all comes as hardly fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as a rib out of their side.
We see men can be content yearely to bestow much money in
playes, pastimes, and other delights, and that with zeale and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestnes:
but come to the poore, our owne flesh, to our brother,
who beares the same image of God as we do, here we sticke, and
from winter to winter suffer them to starue for want of that
which our dogs haue. To moue men to help the poore: first see
how men in the old testament were charged with offerings, first
fruites, sacrifices, and many other ceremonies: now these be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
but instead of that altar, the poore they be the altar, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
we must offer our burnt offerings &amp; our sacrifices. Secondly,
<hi>Esay</hi> 58. 10. he which imparts his heart to the poore, that is, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him in want, hath his heart touched with the bowels of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion,
and testifies his loue in releeuing his want: this man
hath a happie promise, his name shall not be put out, but shine
for euer: and this is true religion, <hi>to visit the fatherlesse and widow,
to comfort and releeue them,</hi> Iam. 1. Prou. 25. <hi>He which giueth to
the poore, lendeth to the Lord.</hi> Now the Lord he comes in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to borow, he makes the pore his stewards to gather it in: wilt
thou say him nay, to lend him of his owne? thou wilt not. Woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
thou haue him stay, or send his steward away emptie. Again,
Christ comes in their person, he askes an almes, he saith in their
person, I am hungry, naked, fatherles and motherles, and in them
he stands crauing at our doores. Now if we would escape that
horrible sentence of condemnation, <hi>Away from me, &amp;c.</hi> let vs not
say him nay, or deny him. But if we wil be liberall in any thing,
and bestow largely on any thing, bestow it on the poore, our
owne flesh, and so we lend to God who is the best paymaster,
and we giue to Christ, who will not let it be vnrewarded.</p>
            <p>Now followeth the third particular vertue, for which Christ
commends the Church of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> which is <hi>faith,</hi> that is, fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:14859:121"/>
whereby we are faithfull to God, in keeping our promise
made to him in baptisme: wherein we promise to renounce our
selues, to beleeue in God, three persons, one true God, to obey
him all our life time: this is commaunded, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 12. Now
it would be wished, that our Church might be commended for
this fidelitie, but it cannot: for though it be a common thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
vs to sweare by our faith, yet there is litle faith in our
hearts, yea litle care to keepe this fidelitie promised in baptisme:
for some of vs lie in ignorance, neuer knowing what promise we
haue made to God; and such are many among vs, young, olde,
high, low, rich, &amp; poore. Others they haue no care of goodnes, of
heauen or heauenly things, but of eating, drinking, sporting, in
which they spend their days, neuer thinking of Christ, or of their
promise to him. A third sort, are those which we account honest
and wise men; but they come short indeed: for these set their
hearts on riches and the things of this world, spend their
strength and wit in the getting of them, and haue their hearts
glued to them. They like Molds are euer in the earth. We call
them (I say) honest men, but indeed they deny God, forsake
their first faith and fidelitie to God in baptisme, and in stead
of the true God, erect an idoll, euen their riches: and of these we
haue great heapes. Then it stands vs in hand, often to remember
our promise in baptisme, to renounce our selues, &amp; the things of
this world, to beleeue in Christ, to performe obedience to him
in al our life: for if we go on, and stil deny our first faith, nothing
belongs to vs but condemnation.</p>
            <p>The fourth vertue, is <hi>patience,</hi> whereof we haue heard in this,
and the former chapter. Here marke how patienc is ioyned with
loue to men, faith to God, and seruice to men and God. The
reason is, because no good action can be done of any man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
patience: loue and faith without it are nothing: for if a man
do his dutie to man, he shall be sure to be hated: now without
patience he ceaseth to do his dutie. So if a man beleeue in God,
and professe the same, the world contemnes him: now without
patience he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not perseuere constantly. Patience is the effect of
faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. faith brings forth hope: and <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. the good
ground brings forth fruit, but in patience. All that a man doth, if
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:14859:122"/>
it be done acceptable to God, it must be ioyned with patience.
Then we must in all our gifts and graces ioyne patience with our
hope, faith, loue, knowledge, &amp;c. 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 6. No grace can shew it
selfe without this, a man cannot endure the crosse without it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And thy workes,</hi> Christ before had said the same: here he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peateth
it againe, which is not idle: for no word in scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is idle: but by this Christ shewes his exceeding approbation
of the workes of this Church of Thyatira, that they were such as
he liked of, not in a meane, but in exceeding great measure: the
cause why he liked them so, followeth afterward.</p>
            <p>Now seeing Christ repeates these words after foure worthy
vertues, he doth it to shew vs what things are required to a good
worke, namely faith, loue, seruice, patience, and fidelity: for to do
a worke to God, we must ioyne these foure vertues: and therfore
Christ addeth these words both before and after these vertues.
First, faith is required, because in doing any actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> must
shew his fidelitie to God, which we do, when before we do any
worke, we search the word of God, whether it be commanded
or forbidden there: for no worke we do can please God, vnlesse
we be perswaded out of the word that it is lawfull: nay, being
not of faith, it is sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. Secondly, our works must not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from faith alone, but from faith and loue ioyntly together,
for faith worketh by loue: and though a man do neuer so good
things, if not in loue, it is nothing. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. Thirdly, a speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
seruice is required to God and man: for all our workes must
be done in seruice to man: for the end of our callings be to do
seruice to man, and withal in doing seruice to man, to please and
serue God. <hi>Paul</hi> commaunds seruants to please their masters in
the Lord, as seruing him: so of all men it is vnderstood, that they
in doing the workes of their calling, must do them in seruice to
men, and withall to serue God. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 21. This ouerthroweth
the Papists fasting, praying, pilgrimage, hard attire, and whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
themselues, to pray to Saints, and offer to them: for these
come not from faith and loue, neither are they done in seruice
to men, to do them good in soule or body: for these neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
themselues nor other. Last of all, patience is requisite that a
man may haue constancy and perseuerance, for no man can do a
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:14859:122"/>
good worke as he ought, but many will mocke and iest at him;
he shall haue many crosses by wicked men, euen by Gods
prouidence: now that he might be constant, patience is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie,
that so (as the good ground) he may bring foorth fruit, but
in patience. To apply this, euery man in doing any thing in his
particular calling, must labour to shew these foure vertues: his
faith to God, loue to man, his seruice to God and man, and
haue patience to vndergo all troubles which come by doing his
dutie. For if a man do the worke of his particular calling, be it
neuer so base, yet it is as good a worke to God in it kind, as to
preach the word, and to giue almes.</p>
            <p>The fifth vertue is, that <hi>her workes were mo at last then at first.</hi>
The Church of Ephesus was discommended for her decay in
loue: but here Christ commendeth this Church for increase
in godlinesse and vertue. It were to be wished, that our Church
might be commended for this vertue; but alas it cannot: for the
bodie of our people are in number increased, but litle in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
and obedience. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. They indeed in regard of the time
might be teachers, hauing so long heard the word: but yet they
need to be taught euen the principles of religion: for though
they heare daily, yet is there no knowledge, no increase of zeale
or of repentance, no going on in grace: 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. they are euer
learning, yet neuer come to knowledge. This is a common fault
in all estates, men heare much, learne litle, and practise lesse:
nay we haue a worse fault, for many among vs hauing heard
good things, go backward, loose them, become worse, or else
stand at a stay. And this is our shame, that many places which
heare the wordlesse, go before vs in knowledge, faith, obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and repentance. Then if we would auoide Gods wrath
and discommendation, let vs now increase. It is not enough for
old men to say they cannot: though their memorie faile, yet
they must labour to haue good and zealous affections. Young
men must employ their strength, and wit, and memorie in this,
to increase in grace, &amp; not to quench any grace, but to stirre the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
vp: for to him which hath is giuen, but fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him which hath not
is taken away that he had. Then all must labor to go on in grace,
that the teacher may haue comfort, and the hearers be freed
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:14859:123"/>
from shame and discommendation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Notwithstanding I haue something against thee.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vers. 20.</note> Here Christ af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his high commendation, rebuketh the Church of Thyatira:
first, the whole Church: secondly, a certaine woman in the
Church. The rebuke concerning the whole Church is in the
twentieth verse: in which is first, the reproofe it selfe: secondly,
the reason of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Neuerthelesse.</hi> That is, though I haue hitherto commended
thee, yet thou hast something which I like not, but greatly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like.
Of this I haue spoken before.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the reason of the reproofe. <hi>Because thou sufferest
the woman Iesabell to teach:</hi> that is, because they suffered a certain
woman, namely <hi>Iesabel,</hi> in the assemblies to teach and seduce
the people.</p>
            <p>First, obserue in these words, the great power and authority
which this Church had giuen her of God: for besides the power
of preaching the word, and administration of the Sacraments,
she had power to appoint who should preach, who shold not:
and further authoritie to restraine wicked men and women by
her seuere gouernment. The like power was in the Church of
Ephesus; &amp; so of al Churches, in preaching of the word, &amp; admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration
of the Sacraments, to appoint who shold preach, and
who not, and also to restraine wicked men, that they commit
not what wickednesse they will in the congregation. And this
authoritie hath the Lord giuen to all Churches: nay, without
this, no Church can continue or stand. And it is not sufficient to
haue rule in the congregation, but seuere gouernment, wherby
wicked men may be kept in order: and because this Church v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
not this power, therefore she is discommended. Now in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
Church where the word is preached, and Sacraments ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred,
there they haue the same power: yet we see how sin
abounds, fornication, adulterie, blasphemie, vsurie, drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and all for want of this gouernment, which should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
such sinnes.</p>
            <p>This Church sinned, first, in suffering a woman to teach: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
to seduce the people of God. This word <hi>teach,</hi> signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to teach publikely in the assemblies. Then they sinned in suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:14859:123"/>
a woman, <hi>Iesabel,</hi> to teach publikely in the open assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
of men. For 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 8. I permit not a woman to teach:
1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 34. they must keepe silence. But it may obiected,
first, that <hi>Deborah</hi> and <hi>Huldah</hi> were Prophetesses. <hi>Ans.</hi> They
were extraordinarie: and we may not make an ordinarie rule
vpon extraordinarie actions. Secondly, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. If a woman
pray or prophecie. <hi>Ans.</hi> First, there were such in the infancie
of the Church, and were extraordinarie. Secondly, they did
sinne, and as a fault it is rebuked in the fourteenth Chapter,
where he commaundeth women to be silent. Thirdly, women
are said to pray, because they giue assent to the Minister
praying, saying Amen, and to prophecie by singing Psalmes,
and reading Scripture: for so much the word (Prophecie) sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth
being taken largely. So <hi>(1. Chron. 25.) Asaph</hi> is said to
prophecie, when he sung with instruments of musicke in the
congregation.</p>
            <p>Seeing Christ rebuketh them for suffering a woman to teach
in the congregation:<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> we see it is not warrantable, that she should
administer the Sacrament of Baptisme, no not in the time of
necessitie: for the word and Sacraments go together. Now
Christ will not haue a woman to preach the word, therefore
not to administer the Sacraments. And though women be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
to teach in the congregation, yet they must teach at
home. <hi>Salomon</hi> he learned many lessons of his mother, who
taught him at home. <hi>Prou.</hi> 31. So <hi>(2. Tim. 1. 5.) Timothy</hi> was
taught by his grandmother <hi>Lois,</hi> and <hi>Eunice</hi> his mother in the
Scriptures. But hence some gather, (without ground) that as a
woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may not teach, so not gouern. But this cannot be proued
out of the word, and it hath no force. For though a woman may
not teach, and stand in Christs stead in the congregation, yet
she may gouerne and stand in his stead in the Common wealth,
be a Queene, Dutchesse, Countesse, &amp;c. For there is special rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why she may not stand in Christs stead in the Church, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
men onely so stand in his stead: for Christ tooke on him
the person of a man, not of a woman: but that letteth
not, but she may stand in his stead in the Commonwealth, if she
come to it by succession, seeing it is her patrimonie and inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:14859:124"/>
And we haue great cause to blesse almightie God for the
gouernment of a woman, more then any which euer yet ruled
ouer vs. But it is said, the man is the womans head, therefore he
must beare rule, not she: <hi>Ans.</hi> He is the head, that is, more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,
as he is man, but not in regard of any gifts: for a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
may passe a man in grace, and gifts of God, and other res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects,
and so may haue rule ouer the man, though he be more
excellent as he is man, she inferiour as she is woman.</p>
            <p>The second fault reproued in the Church of Thyatira is, <hi>the
suffering of a woman to teach and seduce.</hi> Then as to suffer a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to teach openly in the Church is a fault, so to suffer her to
seduce is a fault likewise. Seeing Christ reproueth them for suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
her: we see it is not left to mans will to teach and hold
what he will, but men must be restrained, that they teach and
hold nothing which standeth not with the word of God: they
must reproue patrons and defenders of sects, and schismes, and
new doctrines: for which, our Church is to be commended,
which hath lawes for Papists, Protestants, and Recusants, which
is both lawfull and commended by Christ.</p>
            <p>To aggrauate these two faults, he describeth her by her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties:
first, that she is called <hi>Iesabel:</hi> that is, one like <hi>Iesabel:</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
by her action, she called her selfe a Prophetesse.</p>
            <p>First, the woman <hi>Iesabel.</hi> But why doth Christ call her so?
First, because this woman was like <hi>Iesabel,</hi> and did in her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
reuiue the wicked manners and opinions of <hi>Iesabel:</hi> for as
<hi>Iesabel</hi> was an idolater, brought in idolatrie, &amp; the worship of
<hi>Baal</hi> among the Israelites: so this woman in the Church of Thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atyra.
Secondly, as she was giuen to fornication, so this woman
was a maintainer and teacher of the same. Thirdly, as <hi>Iesabel</hi>
was a woman of authoritie, and by her authoritie did counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
and defend her sinnes, false religion and the worship
of <hi>Baal:</hi> so this woman was also of great authoritie, and by the
same, taught and maintained her diuellish opinions.</p>
            <p>In this reason see the practise of the diuell, who laboureth in
ages following, to renew and reuiue the vices and sinnes which
were before, &amp; their errors. For as he had <hi>Iesabel</hi> in <hi>Ahabs</hi> time,
who was a patron of fornication and idolatrie: so in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:14859:124"/>
time he had this woman, who renewed these opinions, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<hi>Iesabel</hi> like her. The end is to further his kingdom: for the
diuell seeth that these meanes most dishonour God, hurt his
kingdome, and most of all build his kingdom: and so he dealeth
in al ages, to reuiue the opinions, errors &amp; scismes of old. So they
which follow <hi>Machiauel,</hi> imitate the doings of <hi>Achitophel.</hi> So the
Papists reuiue the errors of the Scribes and Pharises: they which
separate themselues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our Church, the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Donatists:
the Family of loue, the error of the Vale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinians. The second rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is, because by this name he might draw the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to dislike of her,
and not to follow her, but that she might be in as great disgrace
as <hi>Iesabel</hi> was in the old Testament. And this Christ doth to
teach vs in reading the bookes of the old and new Testament, if
we reade of any wiked men, that we should dislike their vices
and errors, take heed of them and auoid them: nay, if we see them
in vs, we must dislike our selues for them: and contrarily, if we
reade of a vetruous man or woman, we must imitate their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
like and loue them, and our selues for them, if we haue the
same.</p>
            <p>The second argument whereby he describes her, is her acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Which calleth her selfe a Prophetesse:</hi> that is, she doth cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
to her selfe to be such a one as taught the word by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
and help of Gods spirit, and that all she taught was the
word of Gods spirit. She taught fornication was no sinne, and
that one might go into the Idoll temple and eate of their offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings,
and yet she pretends all to be done and taught by Gods
spirit, making him the teacher and author of her errors.</p>
            <p>Seeing wicked men and women father their errors on Gods
spirit,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> we must labour to get the spirit of discerning, to know
whether the spirit be of God or not: and we must not be of no
religion, because many teach false doctrine, but rather labour to
haue the spirit of discerning, to try the spirits which we heare.
Againe, when we are accused or slandered, we must be content:
for we see this woman taught false doctrine, and yet fathered it
on Gods spirit, which indeed was not of him but of the diuell,
and so made him the author of errors. Now if the Lord be thus
dealt withall, made the author of lies by wicked men: shall not
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:14859:125"/>
we be content, if we be slaundered, who by our sinnes deserued
the same? As she chalenged her selfe to be a Prophetesse, so she
proued her selfe to be one, namely, by her owne testimony, and
her owne word, <hi>she said</hi> she was one. Here Christ sheweth the
note of a false Prophet, namely, a mans owne word and testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
but a true Prophet hath many tokens and arguments, to
proue him to be so. As in the Primitiue Church they spake sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
tongues without study, often wrought miracles, as seales of a
true Prophet. Secondly, they held vnitie of doctrine, in integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of life and conuersation, to confirme their callings. Thirdly,
they had excellent gifts giuen them of God, as zeale, courage,
and constancy to maintaine their callings, which were extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary:
but this woman had nothing, but her owne word and
bare testimony.</p>
            <p>In the second place (the more to disgrace her and the church
of Thyatira) her teaching was described by the end, which <hi>was
to deceiue men.</hi> Here is another marke of a false Prophet, to teach
to seduce and draw men to some sinne or wickednesse. The
end of true teaching is godlynes; but of false, it is to draw men
to sinne in life and conuersation.</p>
            <p>After he describeth her seducing by two arguments: first, the
persons, <hi>my seruants:</hi> secondly, the meanes, <hi>to make them commit
fornication, and to eate of things offered to idols.</hi> For the persons, <hi>my
seruants:</hi> this increaseth her fault, seeing they were excellent me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
the seruants of Christ. Hence arise two questions: first, why some
men be rather the seruants of Christ then other some: secondly,
whether the seruants of Christ can be seduced. For the first, some
say, God would haue euery man in the world his seruant, &amp; doth
what he can to make them so; he calleth them, redeemeth them,
giueth them grace to be his children, reconcileth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to himself,
so that they may if they will be saued: now some will not for all
this receiue Gods grace, but contemne his mercy though he call
them, redeeme them, and giue them grace. But this is against
common sense, to make Gods will in subiection &amp; mans will to
rule, to disgrace God and set man aloft, to make Gods will to be
ordered by mans will. But the reason why some are the seruants
of God, not al, is Gods good pleasure in electing some, and reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:14859:125"/>
others, for he electeth not all to grace and glory, but some
onely, and these be his seruants, by reason of his owne good will
and pleasure. Act. 13. 48. <hi>As many as were ordained to life,</hi> that is,
elected and redeemed of Gods free will and pleasure, they <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second question is, whether a seruant of God can be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced?
<hi>Answ.</hi> Seruants be of two sorts: some are only in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
some in deed and truth. Those be onely in appearance
which receiue the word and outward seales, but not the inward
fruite: and these be in our Churches the greatest part: these may
fall away finally and wholly, as did the Galathians and many
other. But those which be in truth the seruants of Christ, though
they may fall in part, yet they cannot fall wholy or finally, <hi>Mat.</hi>
16. the gates of hel shal striue, &amp; shew their strength against that
rocke of faith, but shall not preuaile. So we pray, <hi>Leade vs not
into temptation,</hi> that is, let vs neuer be wholly vnder the power
of Satan. Now what we pray for, that we haue a promise in the
worde for it: and true faith and a constant purpose to
liue in any on sinne cannot stand together; for faith purifieth the
heart, and preserueth it in life and death: <hi>ergo</hi> a true beleeuer
cannot fall wholly or finally.</p>
            <p>To come to the meanes of discerning them, it is <hi>by committing
fornicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and eating things offered to idols.</hi> She made the seruants
of God to sinne by these two sinnes and meanes; which shewes
she was a maintainer of the sect of the Nicolaitanes, of whom
I spake before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And I gaue her space to repent.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vers. 21.</note> Christ reproued the Church of
Thyatira before for suffering her: here he reproueth her for her
obstinacy and hardnes of heart, that she would not repent of
her sinnes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Time to repent:</hi> That is, though her sinnes deserued present
death, yet God suffered her to liue in the world a space of time,
to see if she would repent. Now in her example he teacheth
vs how to vse time whilest we liue in the world, namely, seeing
it is giuen vs of God to repent in, and so to come to saluation, we
must vse it so, &amp; repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t while we haue time. For that cause he lets
some liue twenty or forty yeares: for there is no repentance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:14859:126"/>
we come into this world, or after we go out, therefore while
we liue in it we must repent: then we must thinke of it earnestly,
that we vse it to repent in, that so we may be reconciled to God
receiued to mercy, and haue the kingdome of heauen.</p>
            <p>Then damnable is the practise of our daies, when men liue in
eating, drinking, sporting, carding, &amp; dicing, in spending their
strength and wit in getting riches, neuer thinking of the true end
why they liue, which is to repent, and come to saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but spend
their time he giues them to repent other wayes. The Lord might
cut them off as soone as they be borne, yet he suffereth them to
liue to see if they will repent: then if they runne on in sin, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
their damnation, and do as a man should euery day cary
a faggot for ten yeares to one heape, and be burned himselfe
with them at the end.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I gaue her:</hi> Namely, Christ gaue her time to repent, no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
no man or Angel can dispose of the time of repentance, but
only Christ Iesus, it is in his power alone when one must repent
or not.</p>
            <p>Then seeing it is not in our power, it is best for vs to repent
without delay, while it is called to day. The yong man takes his
swinge, because he is yong, as though he could repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in old age,
or when he list: but he robs Christ of his honor, for he alone can
dispose of the time of repentance. Then take the present, who
knoweth when the Lord will cut him off, and then his estate is
miserable. We thinke a man may repent at the last gaspe: but it
is not good for a man to deferre, seeing he may die quietly by
reason of the sicknesse, yet may die out of Gods fauour. But to
whom gaue Christ this time? To <hi>her:</hi> that is, <hi>Iesabel,</hi> a wicked
woman. Here we see the endles mercy of God in Christ Iesus, he
offereth mercy to <hi>Iesabel,</hi> a leud wicked fornicator, &amp; idolater,
a blasphemous wretch, fathering her sinnes on the spirit of God,
yet she hath mercy offered. So the Lord dealeth not in iustice, to
cut men off, but giueth grieuous sinners time to repent. So did
he to <hi>Manaesses,</hi> a wisard and idolater, who humbling himselfe
was receiued to mercy. <hi>Salomon</hi> an idolater, yet repenting, was
receiued to mercy, for he was a pen-man of the Scripture, <hi>ergo</hi> an
holy man. 2. <hi>Pet. 1. 20. Isay</hi> 1. The Iewes a sinfull people, as ill as
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:14859:126"/>
they which were in hel. The Sodomites and Gomorrheans,
they had mercy offered if they would repent, and though their
sins were as red as crimson, yet God would wash them as white
as snow.</p>
            <p>We may not hence take occasion to sinne: but they which be
grieuous sinners must not despaire, if they can repent they shall
haue mercy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Of her fornication.</hi> She had sundry sinnes, especially idolatry,
which cannot want company, for no sinne goeth alone. Christ
calleth her to repent for that one sinne of fornication, because
that was the most principall sin, the head sinne of that woman:
teaching vs, that when we repent, we must begin with our grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
sins, which most clog our conscience, and by which we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
most. Againe, he which can repent truly of one great sin,
he repents of all: if he hate the greater, he will hate the lesser.</p>
            <p>Then we in repentance must begin at the greater sin, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
in particular for it: for confused repentance is not true; as
to say, I am a sinner, &amp;c. but repentance in particular for particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
sinnes, beginning at the head sinne which most troubleth vs,
that is true repentance.</p>
            <p>Seeing Christ saith, he gaue her time to repent: hence the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
gather, free will, namely to do good, and to repent, for else
this admonition were in vaine. But it followes not, for God
gaue her time to repent, and commaundement to repent, for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ends: first, that then he may with the time giue grace also
to repent, that so she and we may see what we should do, and
withall see our owne want, that we are not able to do as we
are commaunded, and so to make vs inexcusable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And she repented not.</hi> Here <hi>Iesabels</hi> sinne is set downe, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
impenitency, and going on in her sins of fornication and ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry:
concerning which sins, note two things, first, where impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency
is forbidden: secondly, how great a sin it is. First, where
it is forbidden. <hi>Ans.</hi> There are two parts of the word, the law and
the Gospell, and these two be seuered and distinct, neither can
be mingled one with the other. Now the law co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mands things,
which we in that nature of man in which <hi>Adam</hi> was, could haue
fulfilled: but the Gospell commaunds things aboue nature. The
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:14859:127"/>
law cannot command repentance, seeing it reuealeth not repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:<note place="margin">Rom. 2.</note>
but the Gospell commaunds it, and so by an Euangelicall
commaundement this sin is forbidden. As for the second part,
how great this sinne is, know we, that when men liue and go on
in their sins, it is a great sin, seeing by it men heape vp sinne and
wrath to themselues. Some say it is a sin against the holy Ghost;
but it is vntrue: for that is a blasphemy, so is not impenitency:
that is in this life, but impenitency properly is at death.</p>
            <p>Hence the Papists gather againe, that a man hath free will:
seeing he gaue her time to repent, but she would not. <hi>Ans.</hi> She
had free will to sinne, as all men haue, and so to be impenitent:
but it followes not that she had free wil to do good, &amp; to repent
without Gods speciall grace.</p>
            <p>That which Christ said of <hi>Iesabel,</hi> may be said of our Church,
and most men among vs: he giueth vs long time to repent, ten,
twenty, or thirty yeares; not one of a hundred repents, we care
not to heare the word, and receiue the sacraments: we will not
turne to God truly, but lie in sin, in ignorance, in contempt of
the word, in prophanation of the Sabbath, couetousnesse, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
idlenesse, drinking, and eating; so that our liues tell plainly,
not one of a thousand turnes to God truly.</p>
            <p>Now Christ hauing reproued the Church and <hi>Iesabel,</hi> from
the 22. to the 28. verse, he giueth speciall counsell to them both.
The end of his counsell is, to direct them how to auoide the
iudgement of God, both in this and the life to come. The coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
of Christ hath two parts: the first concerneth the woman
<hi>Iesabel</hi> and her company: the second, the Church of Thya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tira.</p>
            <p>The counsell concerning her, is in the 22. and 23. verses: the
summe of it is to repent: thou <hi>Iesabel</hi> and thy company and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
repent of your sins. This is not expressed, but in stead ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is the reason, vers. 22. 23. The reason is this, If thou wilt not
repent, I will punish thee with sundry iudgements: but thou
wouldst not be punished with sundry iudgements, therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Behold I will.</hi> This is the reason, in which note two parts: first,
a threatning: secondly, an exception, except they repent of
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:14859:127"/>
their workes.</p>
            <p>Before the threatning Christ sets this note of attention. This
should teach her &amp; vs to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider seriously of iudgements against
sin and sinners in the written word of God. <hi>Iosias</hi> when the law
was read, his heart melted, which was at the threatnings of the
law. 2. <hi>King.</hi> 24. So when <hi>Peter</hi> preached, the Iewes were pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
in heart, because he told them of the fearefull iudgement
due to them for killing the Lord of life. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 37. So should we
with <hi>Iosias</hi> be humbled at the serious consideration of Gods
threatnings against sin, and be moued to repent. And the cause
why sin is so rife, is, because men thinke not earnestly, or else re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
not Gods iudgements against sin and sinners.</p>
            <p>The threatning hath three parts, according to three estates.
The first concerning <hi>Iesabel: I will cast her into a bed.</hi> We may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the meaning of these words by those <hi>(2. Sam. 13. 5.)</hi> of <hi>Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dab</hi>
to <hi>Amnon, Ly down on thy bed, and faine thy self sick.</hi> So here I
I will cast her into a bed, that is, strike her with some great sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes:
the place, namely the bed, put for the sicknes which is in the
man lying on the bed. <hi>Iesabel</hi> tooke pleasure in the bed by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,
who abusing the bed, the Lord to punish her in the bed
accordingly, gaue her sicknes in the same bed which she abused.
Here is Gods dealing with sinners, he punisheth them in those
things they haue abused. <hi>Iesabel</hi> abused the bed to fornicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; the
Lord punished her in the bed, with some great disease and sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.
<hi>Diues</hi> abused his tongue and tast in Gods creatures, &amp; he is
punished in them. <hi>Luke</hi> 16. he asked a drop of water to coole his
tongue. Gamesters take pleasure in abusing time, and spend it in
carding and dicing, their punishment it brings many iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
on them, they come to ruine and misery. <hi>Ahab</hi> to get the
vineyard, sheds bloud, the Lord sheds his, <hi>Iesabels,</hi> and his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens:
and they which liue by the bloud of the poore, &amp; draw it
out of them, are punished with the like, for bloud will haue
bloud, and the Lord will punish men in those sins wherein they
tooke most pleasure.</p>
            <p>Then this should admonish vs to take heed we abuse no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of God, for the Lord he will turne the same to our punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="236" facs="tcp:14859:128"/>
               <hi>I will cast her:</hi> That is, strike her with some grieuous sicknes.
Here we see the author of sicknes, it is not by chance, but comes
from the hand of God: if men could learne this, they would
make better vse of sicknesse: if men could say, the Lord hath cast
me on my bed, visited my body with sicknes, he hath done it for
some of my sins, to humble me, and make me repent; then they
would find in their recouery a blessing, and liue a new life. <hi>Esay
38. Hezekiah</hi> when he lay on his death bed, knew it came from
the Lord, &amp; therfore, hearing <hi>Esay</hi> say he must die, he turned him
to the wall and wept, as for other things, so especially for his sins,
and craued pardon for them. So <hi>Iacob</hi> lying on his bed, leaned on
his staffe, sate vp and prayed for pardon of his sins, and to testifie
his faith and hope to God. So should we in our sicknesse shew
our faith and hope, and pray for pardon of sinnes committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him.</p>
            <p>The second part of the threatning, which concernes her dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
and followers, which receiued her doctrine, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
fornication with her: and their punishment is to be cast into
great affliction.</p>
            <p>We see it is a great sin to commit fornication, and not a trick
or slip of youth, as we call it, seeing Christ assignes a great pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
to it. Againe, we see some causes why townes, cities,
and countries be afflicted with much famine, sword and pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence:
namely, because there be fornicators and maintainers of
errors and superstition: for God sends these iudgements, as for
other sins, so for fornication. Sodom was destroyed for this sin.
And euen in our time, we haue plagues, famin, sword, many sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
and that for this sin among the rest. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. many were
dead for this sin, lest they shold come defiled to the Lords table.</p>
            <p>Now followes the exception: <hi>Except they repent.</hi> Here we see,
all Gods iudgements and threatnings be with exception in the
matter of saluation. And seeing Christ ads this exception, <hi>vnlesse
they repent:</hi> we see men of yeares condemned in the Church, not
so much for sin, as liuing in sin without repentance. Indeed the
least sin makes a man subiect to condemnation, but lying in sin,
that brings actual condemnation &amp; the wrath of God vpon vs,
so that if man commit sinne and lie in it, he casts his soule away.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="237" facs="tcp:14859:128"/>
To commit sinne, is not that which killeth vs, but to lye in
sinne: for if a man sinne, and after repent, he shall haue mercie
at Gods hands. Secondly, it is propounded in the midst of the
threates: for they go before this exception, and come after.
Where we see, God mingleth his mercie with iudgement, he
sheweth not all iudgement, nor all mercie, but tempereth them
together. Now, in that the Lord will bring iudgement on them
vnlesse they repent: we see that repentance preuenteth tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
iudgement. We haue had long peace, and haue abused it to
commit sinne, now we must looke for Gods iudgements: and
we see the Spaniard as a weapon of God, now the Lord may
iustly bring him on vs. The best way to preuent this and al Gods
iudgements, is, for high and low, and all estates to repent, and
so the Lord will turne him away.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Of thy workes:</hi> namely, fornication &amp; idolatrie. So we, if we
wil repent, we must cease from our particular sins, as the drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard
from his drunkennesse, and to liue soberly, &amp;c. For to say,
I am sorie, and in generall to repent, as many men do, is but to
make shew of repentance: but men must leaue each sinne, and
do the contrarie vertue.</p>
            <p>In the three and twentieth verse, is the third part of this
threatening, <hi>I will kill her child with death:</hi> that is, such as be of
her familie, and her children in fornication, not them which
follow her doctrine, but properly, for they are reproued before.
<hi>I will kill.</hi> It had bene sufficient, to say so: but he addeth, <hi>I will
kill with death:</hi> for the certaintie, largenesse, and fulnesse of it,
not sparing them. But the mother sinned, shall the child be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
for her sake? <hi>Ans.</hi> In temporall and bodily punishments
it may be so, not in eternall punishments. Among men, if the
father be a traitor, the Son is punished, and beareth the shame:
then shall it not be equitie with God to punish the sonne for
the fathers sinne in bodily punishment? And though there were
no reason to vs, yet we should thinke it good with God. But
there is reason sufficient, why the Lord should destroy cities,
and commonwealths, and families, which be linked together
by the bond of societie, and be members of the same familie.
Now if one member sinne, the other may be punished: as in the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:14859:129"/>
bodie, if the stomacke be sicke, the head feeleth it: so when the
father sinneth, the sonne may be punished: when the husband,
the wife: when the Maister, the seruant: when the subiect, the
magistrate: because of the mutuall relation, and nigh bond of
societie betweene members of the same familie, citie, or king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
Is this so? then parents had need to take heed how they
sinne: for they sinning, may bring iudgments and death on their
familie or their children. Then are they cruell parents, which
liue in sinne, not caring for their children, but by their sinnes
bring Gods iudgements on them, and on their families. Let
then euery man in the societie where he liueth, be carefull he
sinne not: for then he may bring Gods iudgement on the place,
especially, if he be a speciall member: as <hi>Ahab</hi> on himselfe and
his children, and <hi>Dauid</hi> on the whole people. Then all such as
will not looke to themselues, but liue in sinne, should be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
out of all societies, vnlesse they will repent and be new
men: seeing they do what they can to bring Gods iudgements
on that place where they liue.</p>
            <q>
               <bibl>Vers. 24.</bibl> That all Churches may know, that I am he, which sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
the heart and reines.</q>
            <p>Christ hauing propounded his threatning, here he goeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to make it take place in them: in <hi>Iesabell</hi> and her company,
by remouing of two carnall conceipts, whereby they might
thinke to illude and auoid Christs threatnings. For first, they
might haue said, Our practises and sinnes be secret, not knowne
to men: therefore though God threaten, we shall escape the
iudgements of God: but we are without the reach of them, they
cannot take hold of vs. But Christ in the first words cutteth off
this first conception: Thogh you may perswade your selues you
shall escape iudgement, seeing your sinnes be secret, yet I search
the heart, and I will discouer them to all Churches: they shall
know that I search the heart, that is, I see and know the most
hidden and secret thoughts and affections of the heart.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That all Churches.</hi> Christ will discouer their sins, not to all
the world, but to all Churches: and this he speaketh, to the end
to terrifie <hi>Iesabel</hi> and her companie. For as it is a great honour
to be approued and esteemed of all Churches, so it is a great
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:14859:129"/>
disgrace and dishonor to be euill thought of by the Churches
of God. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. That which is bound in earth by the church
of God, is bound in heauen by God himselfe: so by proportion
those which be euill thought of in Gods church, and in disgrace
of it, they be in disgrace with God in heauen.</p>
            <p>Seeing Christ speaketh this to terrifie <hi>Iesabel</hi> and her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie,<note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note>
we must labour in all things to be approued and esteemed
of the Church: though we must approue our selues, as much as
we can, to all, yet especially to the Church of God, and auoide
all things which may bring any disgrace or dishonour to the
Church: for as it is a great honor to be well esteemed of the
Church, so it is a great dishonor to be il esteemed. <hi>Ro. 16. 1. Cor.</hi>
1. the last verse, <hi>Paule</hi> saith: <hi>All the Churches salute you:,</hi> not
that all Churches send commendations by word of mouth: but,
to confirme and comfort them, he saith, all true Churches plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by him, did approue of them: <hi>Act. 16. Paul</hi> approued of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,</hi>
and receiued him to him, because he was commended
and had the approbation of the Churches and brethren at Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conium
and Lystra.. So must we haue the approbation of Gods
Church, which is the approbation of God himselfe. But what
would Christ haue all Churches to know? namely, <hi>that I search
the heart, &amp;c.</hi> In which words, by <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>reines,</hi> is meant the
same thing: namely, by <hi>reines,</hi> is meant the thoughts and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of men, and by heart is meant so much, as it is plaine in
the old &amp; new Testament. But how can these signifie thoughts
and affections, seeing thoughts be in the braine, affections in
the heart, neither of them in the reines? <hi>Ans.</hi> By resemblance:
for as the reines be in the most secret and inward parts of the
bodie: so thoughts be in the most hidden part of man; namely,
his soule. So thoughts are said to be in the heart, because they
haue operation in the heart, though they be placed in the brain.
<hi>Search:</hi> that is, with such circumspection and diligence, as
bringeth the finding out of that we seek. By this is signified, that
Christ seeth not onely the outward actions, but the inward af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
and motions, nothing, the most secret, is hidden from
him.</p>
            <p>We see by this,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> Christ is not onely man, but very God: for
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:14859:130"/>
he which hath the true propertie of God is very God; Christ
hath, ergo. He which is God alone, can search the heart, the
thoughts,<note place="margin">Ier. 7. 10. 11.</note> motions, and inclinations of the heart: but Christ can,
therefore he is true God, one person, consisting of two natures,
the Godhead and manhood. Againe, seeing Christ discerneth
the heart, we must in all things take heed of hypocrisie, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in matters of religion, when we seeme to be that outwardly,
which indeed we are not inwardly: but we must looke that we
be that in truth, and in heart, which we would seeme to the
world: to be &amp; draw nigh to God with our souls, as we do with
our bodies, lips, words, and actions. For Christ is very God,
seeth and searcheth our hearts, thoughts and affections: he loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
not so much to the outward, as the inward seruing of him;
we must worship him in spirit, seeing he is a Spirit. Besides, we
must suspect our selues for vnknowne sins: for such is the depth
of our corruption, that we cannot sound the bottome of it, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can we thorougly see the pronenesse of our nature to sinne
and corruption. Therefore we must suspect our selues, euen of
all sinnes which we know not, and not excuse any sinnes. So
did <hi>Dauid (Psalm. 19.)</hi> after earnest search; as though he had
said: Lord, I haue searched my heart, but I cannot sufficiently
know mine owne corruptions, therefore, O Lord, forgiue me
all mine vnknowne sinnes. And if we could thus suspect our
selues, we would better practise repentance, and liue with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
care; but ignorant persons, not able to search their corrupt
hearts, they blesse themselues, and excuse themselues, nay, say
they can keepe the whole law. Now Christ hauing cut off the
first corrupt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceipt, preuenteth the second, wherby they might
hinder and auoid his iudgement: for they might say, though the
Lord send iudgments, yet we shall be safe, they shall not come
nigh vs. Thus they, and euery sinfull man doth say. <hi>Esa.</hi> 28. They
in common iudgement, make a league with hell, saying Gods
iudgements shall not come nigh them. This is a naturall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of our hearts, that in common iudgement we shall es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape:
and euery man liketh this.</p>
            <p>Now Christ to cut off this corrupt conceipt, saith: <hi>And will
giue:</hi> as if he had said: you may flatter your selues, thinke when
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:14859:130"/>
I send iudgement you shall escape: but I will giue to euery one
(none excepted) according to his workes: therefore flatter your
selues no more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I will giue.</hi> That is, I will reward, partly in this life, and partly
at the day of iudgement: for it is meant especially of the last
iudgement. <hi>Rom. 2. Reu.</hi> 20. Hence the Papists gather, that men
must be saued, not onely by faith, but workes, seeing God will
reward good workes. <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Their reason standeth thus: by
that we are iudged, by the very same thing we are saued: but
we are iudged by workes, therfore saued by works. The flat ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ior
is false: for we must distinguish betweene iudgement and
iustification. To iudge, is to declare one iust by his signes, as his
workes: to iustifie, is to make a man iust: in which we consider
nothing but Christ, and our faith applying him to vs. So then
we are iudged by workes, but not iustified neither saued by
workes. <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. Christ saith not, I will giue for their
workes: but I will giue them according to their works, as their
workes be, not for them; where he maketh workes an outward
signe and rule, according to which he wil frame his iudgement,
to declare men iust.</p>
            <p>Seeing euery man must be iudged,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> that is, saued or condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by his workes, then good workes are necessarie to saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
for we must be iudged by our workes, and saued according
to our workes, therefore they be necessarie: not as causes either
efficient or helping any waies, but as fruites, effects, and
signes of our faith, and markes in the way to heauen, which
must direct vs to eternall life.</p>
            <p>Seeing we shall be iudged in this life, but especially in the
last day, by our workes, we must labour to abound in good
workes; not to winne heauen by them, but to assure our selues
we belong to Christ, and shall be truly vnited to him. Now
all good works, are either the works or duties of the morall law
of God, or else they be those workes of our calling, both gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
as we be Christians, or particular in that calling God pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
vs, done in faith and loue, to Gods glorie, the good of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and in obedience to God. These be good works to God,
though the calling be neuer so base: for which we shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:14859:131"/>
and according to which we shall be iudged and saued.
Now contrarily, euil works they be euident signes of conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
&amp; look how many euil works we do, they be so many brands
and markes of our soules, to shew we be the children of Satan.</p>
            <p>Here we see there are degrees of glorie in heauen, and of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
in hell: for he will reward euery one according to his
works. Then they which haue abounded in good workes, they
shall haue greater measure of glorie: the fewer works, the lesser
glorie: so they which haue committed greatest sinnes, they shall
haue greatest measure of punishment; they which lesse, lesse pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
in hell fire.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And vnto you I say.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vers. 24.</note> In this foure and twentieth verse, he co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to the second part of his counsell to the Church and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
of Thyatira: that is, the better sort of the Church.</p>
            <p>But before the counsell, he setteth a preface: in which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,
note first, who speaketh: secondly, to whom: For the first,
who speaketh: namely, <hi>I.</hi> Where Christ as doctor of the church
challengeth to himselfe all supremacie, and sufficient authoritie
ouer the Church: for all his Ministers come in his name, not in
their owne: <hi>The Lord saith,</hi> or <hi>Christ saith.</hi> But Christ, he comes
in his owne name: <hi>I say.</hi> Noting, he is the head Doctor and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
of the Church, the fountaine and head of all doctrine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
to it. This Christ saith, to smite a reuerence in their harts,
seeing this counsell is not deliuered to them by any man or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell,
but by Christ himselfe, who deliuered it to <hi>Iohn.</hi> For the
second: to whom he giueth counsell: namely, <hi>you:</hi> that is, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally:
after he expoundeth this <hi>you,</hi> namely, to the rest of the
Church of Thyatira, to the whole bodie and Angell of that
Church, except <hi>Iesabel</hi> and her companie. Where note, Christ
speaking to them, distinguisheth betweene persons, namely, the
Church and her Angell, and <hi>Iesabel</hi> and her companie: so suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
he giueth his doctrine to them. Now he being the Doctor
of the Church, teacheth his Ministers what to do: namely, to
distinguish betweene man and man, doctrine and doctrine: not
to deliuer euery part of the word to all men, but to deuide it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
to giue to euery person, that which may be fit for him. But
how must the word be deliuered to mixt congregations, where
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:14859:131"/>
there be both weake and strong, Papists and Protestants, des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing
and impenitent auditors? <hi>Ans.</hi> We must imitate Christ,
we must distinguish betweene persons, and sutably direct our
doctrine to them. Impenitent and hard hearted sinners must
haue threatnings, with exception of the penitent: hard hearted
must haue no comfort but iudgement, with limitation to them
which despaire, these co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forts with limitation of them which be
impenitent. Now what is meant by this, <hi>rest of them,</hi> Christ
sheweth: <hi>And to as many as receiue not this learning.</hi> Where he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
two notes to know these <hi>rest</hi> by. The first, they which had
not this learning, which maintained not the doctrine of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sabel</hi>
and her companie. The second note: they which <hi>haue not
knowne the deepnesse of Satan</hi> (as they call it:) that is, which haue
not approued, liked, withstood, nor giuen their consent to that
depth of Satan: that is, that doctrine of <hi>Iesabel,</hi> which they call
and esteeme to be deepe and profound learning: which these
(though they know it) yet do not with knowledge approue it,
which <hi>Iesabel</hi> and her companie iudged profound learning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the doctrine of the Prophets &amp; Apostles. Of the first note
I haue spoken before. In the second note, we may marke a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
practise of <hi>Iesabel</hi> and her followers: they esteemed their
owne learning highly profound, but the doctrine of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
and Apostles, that was no such matter: an high conceipt
of her owne false doctrine, but a base opinion of true Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
doctrine: and this opinion hath bene in many heretikes. So
the Iewes hold, that God gaue <hi>Moses</hi> two doctrines: the first,
was the written law, which was for the common people: the
second was a more secret doctrine, which <hi>Moses</hi> had by reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and so conueyed it to the Iewes, which they kept still in
the Cabbala. So the Papists thinke, the written word, but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kie
letter, a dead letter, or nose of waxe: but the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
in the heart of all Chatholikes, that they take to be the true
word of God, contemning the written word in the Prophets &amp;
Apostles. So the Anabaptists, they make the word of God writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
to be milke for euery nouice, but the consent of the heart
among themselues, that is the strong meate. Nay, this opinion
is in our Church: for we preferre the writings of men before the
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:14859:132"/>
word of God. For if a man expound a text by the word, gather
doctrines according to the lawes of reason, this we call simple
preaching: but if any bring in the authoritie of men, as Saint
<hi>Ambrose, Augustine,</hi> with Latine or Greeke, this we take to
be a learned kind of preaching, which is nothing else, but to
magnifie the writings of men, to thinke highly of them, but to
disgrace the word of God, thinke basely of it. Here Christ saith,
I grant it is a profound <hi>learning,</hi> not of God, but of the diuell.
Where we see, Christ alleaging this saying of <hi>Iesabel,</hi> doth it
with a disgrace: he saith, it is deepnesse and profoundnesse, but
of the diuell: yea Christ saith not, it is profound indeed; but that
it is <hi>Iesabels</hi> speech, as <hi>they say.</hi> Hence I gather, that Christian
men cannot safely play stage playes, and Comedies of heathen
and prophane men, for these be full of prophane and blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
oathes, and wicked sayings, against God and the morall
law. Now if Christ alleaging but one word of a wicked woman,
did it not without disgrace of her: how can Christian men not
onely speake, but by iesture act, heathen and prophane Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As they speake.</hi> He addeth these words: first, to shew, that
the words he alleaged before, were not his owne, but <hi>Iesabels</hi>
and her scholers. Secondly, to shew the proud and presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
mind of them, in that they call their owne hereticall opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
profound learning: which is a note of a false teacher, to vse
swelling words, and great bragges: to make a faire shew. <hi>Iude</hi>
vers. 16. 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. But the doctrine of God is in humilitie both
of spirit, and maner of teaching. The Lord teacheth his will to
the contrite and humble man. <hi>Psalm.</hi> 25. 14.</p>
            <p>Now followeth Christs counsell: <hi>Though I lay no other bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
on you, yet I will haue you hold that still which I gaue you, to the
end.</hi> This distinction co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taineth two parts; <hi>Though I lay no other,
&amp;c.</hi> in the foure and twentieth verse: <hi>yet I will, &amp;c.</hi> in the fiue
and twentieth verse. In the first part, Christ saith, Though I haue
punished <hi>Iesabel,</hi> left her on a bed; punished her children and
familie; yet I will lay no burthen on thee, but onely that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue
thee for the suffering of <hi>Iesabel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Christ speaketh to comfort them, and all such as giue
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:14859:132"/>
themselues to maintaine sinceritie of life and of doctrine, for
these shall be saued from common iudgements, and haue the
Lords protection in commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> afflictions: though I punish <hi>Iesabel</hi>
and her company, yet when wicked men be punished in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
destruction, you which study to maintaine sinceritie of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and life, shall haue Gods protection in common iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>Then it stands vs in hand to imitate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note> to labor to maintaine
sinceritie in doctrine, to defend truth in life and conuersation,
to make conscience of all sin. If we labour to obey the Lord in
all things, to keepe sincere hearts, then in common iudgements
though <hi>Iesabel</hi> and her company, yea all wicked persons be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
it shall not touch vs, we shall find Gods mercie and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
our punishment shall be onely reproofe for some defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in vs. But if we maintaine falshood in doctrine, liue loosely,
not making conscience of sin, then Gods iudgements shall take
hold of vs, and afflict vs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But that which you haue alreadie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verse. 25.</note> 
               <hi>hold fast till I come.</hi> After the
preface followes the summe of the counsell of Christ to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
and Church of Thyatira, which stands in a distinction,
though I will lay no burden on thee, yet I wil haue you hold fast,
&amp;c. the first part is in the 24. verse, the second part in these
words, as before I said.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That which you haue receiued.</hi> That is, that which my Apostles
and Prophets haue taught you, that doctrine of saluation they
haue deliuered you, hold that fast with both hands, till I come to
iudgement at the last day. Before Christ commended this
Church for not approuing the false doctrine of <hi>Iesabel,</hi> but here
he commands her to embrace the doctrine of the Prophets and
Apostles.</p>
            <p>Hence we see, Christ would haue this Church to embrace
the doctrine taught by his Apostles, to maintaine that, and not
to regard any other, but though an Angell from heauen
did preach any other doctrine, he should be accursed. <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat.</hi>
1.</p>
            <p>By this we may iudge of the maine religions which be in the
world,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> namely, of the Turkes, Iewes, and Papists. The Papists
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:14859:133"/>
magnifie their religion standing on vnwritten traditions, but
they cannot proue they be Apostolical, <hi>ergo</hi> we must not regard
them: no, nor doctrines which men say they haue by reuelation,
for we must onely regard Apostolicall doctrine. As for the
Turkes religion, it was not the Apostles preaching, but crept in
six hundred yeares after them. And for the Iewes, all their religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
is against the Gospel. Then good men in diuers countries shold
not be of diuers religions, but they should embrace the doctrine
taught by the Prophets and Apostles of Christ: neither should
men because of dissent in religion, be of no religion: for Christ
inioynes this Church to maintaine the doctrine of the Apostles,
though many discented from it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hold fast to the end.</hi> Here not how long, not one or two
dayes, but to the end, and we must looke to this, seeing Christ so
straightly commands it, because this is the foundation and mark
of true religion, and the readie way to saue mens soules, to be
constant to the end: and for this <hi>(2. Tim. 2.) Paul</hi> bids him teach
that he learned, that others might instruct them which follow,
and so conuey it from age to age: and for this the Church is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the ground and pillar of truth. And so the Lord <hi>(Eph. 4.)</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
the Church Pastors: first, such as by their teaching main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
puritie in maners, and teachers which maintaine it in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.
Then this is the Churches dutie, to continue puritie of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
to the end of the world. If the marke be set wrong in the
hauen, it is enough to cast away all the ships: so if the puritie of
doctrine be corrupt, which is the direction of our soules to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
then we shall make shipwracke of our soules in hell. Then
the Ministers must not onely teach truly, but labour to beate
downe false doctrine which poisons the doctrine of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.
And because men labour not to maintaine the puritie of
religion and true doctrine, the Lord <hi>(2. Thess. 2.)</hi> giueth them
vp to beleeue lies and fantasies of men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To him which ouercometh, &amp;c.</hi> In these words is the last part,
to wit, the conclusion of the Epistle containing two parts: first,
a promise: secondly, a commaundement. In the promise, note
two things: first the parties to whom: secondly, the benefits pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised.
The partie to whom, <hi>to him which ouercometh:</hi> whom
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:14859:133"/>
here Christ describes to be, <hi>he which keepes his workes, by his pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
of obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>He which keepes</hi> or <hi>obserues.</hi> This is the forme of obedience,
namely the obseruing of the works of Christ, which is not a kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of them according to the rigour of the law, but a constant
purpose and indeuour to keepe them: for the children of God
haue this priuiledge, that their will and indeuour is accepted of
God for the deed in Christ Iesus. There are many which haue
litle knowledge, these must not be cast downe, but if they haue a
desire and indeuour to liue according to the will of Christ, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
conscience of sinne, their obedience is true obedience, and
acceptable to Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My workes.</hi> Here is the matter of obedience, namely Christs
works: that is, such workes as Christ hath ordained in his word
by his spirit, and is the author of in his members.</p>
            <p>Christ cals these workes <hi>his workes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note> therefore we must not
thinke or speake, or do our words or workes, but onely Christs
workes, commanded and ordained in his word, and caused in
vs by his spirit: which we do when we conforme our works and
wils, to his word and will.</p>
            <p>We see no worke is acceptable to God,<note place="margin">Vse. 2.</note> which is not ordered
by Christs word, though we think highly of it. <hi>Esay.</hi> 6. he repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
them for teaching the feare of God by mens co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.
This condemnes the Turkes, Papists, and Iewes religion, which
are not workes of Christ but of sinfull men, standing in praying
to Saints, fasting, vowing, Masses, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My workes:</hi> Not one or two workes, but all my workes:
the creature must obey Christ, not in some, but absolutely in all
things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he will not pattstakes, but wil haue all or none. <hi>Dauid</hi>
(Psal. 119.) conformed himselfe to the whole law. So <hi>Hezekiah</hi>
he turned to all the law of <hi>Moses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vnto the end.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vse.</note> Here we see, Christ will haue our obedience to
be constant, &amp;c. we must not iudge of obedience by one or two
actions, but by the course of a mans life: if his life hath bene
good, with conscience of sinne, then his obedience is good. For
say a man by reason of sicknesse, rage and raue at his death, yet if
he haue liued well, and made conscience of sinne, we must not
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:14859:134"/>
iudge of him by that fit. Now the benefits promised are two:
first, power to rule: secondly, the morning starre. <hi>I will giue him
power which I haue receiued of my father.</hi> These words must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to the words, not following but before. For the better vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
of them, two questions are necessary: first, what is
the power of the Mediator: secondly, how farre he conueyeth
power to his seruants. For the first, the power of Christ as he is
Mediator is great, and described by three arguments: first, to
rule ouer nations: here is the largenesse of it, for Christ hath po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
ouer all men, all countries and kingdomes in the whole
world are in his hand. Secondly, it is soueraigne and absolute,
ruling and ouerruling all creatures, ouerruled of none. This so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigntie
stands in two things, first, that he giueth lawes that
binde the conscience, so that if men keepe them not, he hath
power to condemne them: nay he ruleth mens wils and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
he can make them obey him in spite of their hearts. Secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in that he hath this power of himself and from himself. <hi>Reu.</hi> 3.
he hath the keyes of heauen and hel. <hi>Psal.</hi> 2. he can breake them
in peeces as a potters vessell. Thirdly, he receiues it from his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as he is God he is equall to his father, yet as he is Mediator,
he receiueth it from him: thus is his power generall, soueraigne,
and absolute. To come to the second question. How farre this
power is ours, and imparted to vs. <hi>Answ.</hi> The generall soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
power of Christ is not giuen to vs, or to any creature, but
to him who is God and man; it is incommunicable to any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and proper to the person of Christ.</p>
            <p>Then Christ speaketh these words, not to shew that his abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
&amp; soueraigne power is giuen to vs: but because his creatures
haue the benefit of it, the full comfort and saluation of the elect
cometh from it, they haue fruite of it, in that they partake with
him in his glory in heauen. <hi>Ephes. 2. 7. 2. Cor.</hi> 6. the Saints shall
iudge the world, that is, shall be witnesses and approuers of
Christs sentence, not that they shall haue power to giue iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but they shall be caught vp first, and he giuing sentence,
they sitting by him shall approue it. Secondly he giueth vs this
power, because he by this inables his in their owne person to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome
sin, the world, and their owne corruption.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="249" facs="tcp:14859:134"/>
By this we see our dignitie, euery seruant of God hath power
ouer nations, ouer the world, to rule and breake them in peeces,
to iudge and condemne them.<note place="margin">Vse.</note> Is this our priuiledge? then we
had need to take heed of all sinne, for we cannot condemne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men of sin, and be guiltie of sin our selues. For it is a great
disgrace for a Iudge to condemne a malefactor of murther or
theft, and be guiltie himselfe. So Christ, if we be full of sinne, and
make no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science of it, he wil neuer let vs sit to iudge the world
with himselfe. Then seeing we are Kings, Iudges, and haue such
priuiledges, we must looke to our selues. Againe, this is our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
in persecution, if thou be the child of God, thou art a King,
a Iudge, though thou be now poore, abused and persecuted, yet
the time cometh when thou shalt iudge and condemne thy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors,
and be auenged of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And rule the nations,</hi> as a shepheard ruleth his sheepe: that is,
to gouerne and feed them, <hi>Iohn 21. Feed my lambes,</hi> that is, feed
and rule. Hence the Papists gather, <hi>Peter</hi> was the generall Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
to guide and feed Christs sheepe, that is the world: but
then euery Christian should be a Pope, for euery one hath po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
to rule the nations ouer the whole world: but none will say,
euery one should haue so large authoritie: then it is not meant
of supremacie. Further, from this place the Papists gather, that
Saints be patrons of countries and kingdomes: secondly, that we
may pray to Saints in heauen, for (say they) they haue rule of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<hi>ergo</hi> they know them and what they do. But they abuse
the text, for it is not said, any Christian shall rule ouer one nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but ouer all indefinitely: neither do they rule as Christ, but as
hauing benefit of his power. Again, both their collectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are bad,
for by <hi>nations,</hi> here is not meant any country or kingdome, but
the wicked onely, they haue rule ouer, not all nations simply, but
wicked men and vnbeleeuers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And I will giue him the morning starre.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vers. 28.</note> Here is the second be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
promised by Christ to him which ouercometh, namely the
morning starre, with all the benefits which come thereby. The
morning starre is that starre which riseth before the Sunne some
time of the yeare, and by heathen men is called <hi>Venus,</hi> which in
deed is Christ himselfe. <hi>Reu.</hi> 22. 16. Now Christ is called <hi>a star,</hi>
               <pb n="250" facs="tcp:14859:135"/>
first because he illuminates mens wils and vnderstandings in
things belonging to saluation: secondly, to shew that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie
of <hi>Balaam (Num. 24.)</hi> is now in the new Testament ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled;
for now Christ hath by his Apostles reuealed himselfe
plentifully to all nations. Againe, he is called the <hi>morning starre,</hi>
for speciall resemblance: for that starre riseth not at midnight,
or in the beginning of the night, but in the morning, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the day, and then shineth brighter then all the rest.
So Christ the true morning starre, came not in the beginning of
the world, or in the middest of it, but in the latter age, he
came in the new testament, and fulnesse of time, and now he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealeth
his will more fully then euer in the old testament. 2. <hi>Pet.</hi>
1. 9. Christ then is called this morning starre, for in the old te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament
they had darknesse and candle light, but now Christ
shineth out brightly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I will giue him.</hi> Here is a promise of two benefits, first perfect
illumination and lightning, whereby all ignorance shall be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
after this life, and men shall then so farre know God as
mans nature can comprehend. The second benefit is the light
of glory, not onely of knowledge but perfect glory, for by fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship
of this glory of Christ, we shal be made like Saints and
Angels, shining starres in the kingdome of heauen.</p>
            <p>Seeing Christ is a starre,<note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note> we see how they be deceiued which
liue in sin and ignorance, without good conscience, in pleasure
and securitie, and yet they thinke they belong to Christ, they
haue the true light: but such as liue in blindnesse, neuer seeking
to know Gods will &amp; obey him, these are in darknesse, haue no
light in Christ: for what fellowship is there betwixt light
and darknesse?</p>
            <p>We must follow <hi>Peters</hi> rule,<note place="margin">Vse. 2.</note> first labour to haue this starre to
shine in our hearts, which is, when we vse meanes to haue the
beames of this Sun to shine on vs, to get knowledge in the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of our saluation by Christ, to haue this Sun of righteousnes
to lighten our minds, and withall to warme and refresh our dead
soules, as the sun in the spring reuiues all things which seemed
dead. We must set open the doores of our hearts, and entertaine
this comfortable light.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="251" facs="tcp:14859:135"/>
Seeing Christ is the morning starre, not that shines in the
night, but in the morning, in the day time, we must labor to leade
our liues in godlinesse and sobrietie, as children of the light.
<hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 12. and if we will not walk in this light, it shall be taken
from vs, and we shall be cast into eternall darknesse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let him which hath an eare.</hi> Here is the second part of the
conclusion: but of this often before.</p>

               <q>And to the Angell of the Church of Sardis, &amp;c.</q>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS is the fift particular commandement to
<hi>Iohn:</hi> that he should write an Epistle to that
great and famous citie of Sardis.</p>
            <p>The Epistle hath three parts: first, a Preface:
secondly, body or substance: thirdly, a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
First, the Preface sheweth in whose name
the Epistle was written, to giue it the more authoritie. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
a liuely description of Christ in his kingly office, as he
is the soueraigne head of his Church, and that in two royalties
and priuiledges: first, in that he hath the seuen spirits: secondly,
the seuen starres. For the first, I shewed what it meaneth, chap.
1. vers. 4. namely, the holy Ghost, who is the author of all
grace: so that to haue the seuen spirits, is as much as to say, he
had the holy Ghost. <hi>Ob.</hi> All Gods seruants haue the holy Ghost,
therefore that is no peculiar priuiledge of Christ. <hi>Ans.</hi> True,
but not in the same maner: for Christ had it two wayes: first, in
regard of his Deitie: secondly, of his humanitie. First, as he is
God, he hath in him the beginning of the holy Ghost: for the
holy Ghost proceedeth from the Father and the Sonne. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Christ is said to send the holy Ghost, and to worke by him:
and whatsoeuer he doth in the Church, he doth it by him, and
for that cause Christ is said to haue the seuen spirits. Secondly,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:14859:136"/>
in regard of his manhood: because the holy Ghost hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
foorth into his manhood the perfection of all graces and
gifts whatsoeuer, as he is annointed with the oyle of gladnesse
aboue his fellowes.</p>
            <p>And this perfection standeth in two things: first, in number:
secondly, in degree or measure. First, in number thus: Among
Gods seruants some haue these graces, some those; none haue
all: but Christ hath all the graces which all men and Angels
haue, &amp; more too. Secondly, in degree: for the graces of Christ
are more in measure, then all the graces of all the Saints and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
of God whatsoeuer: he hath the fountaine of all grace,
and therefore he is said to haue the Spirit without measure. And
for that cause also Christ is said to haue the seuen spirits. This is
spoken by occasion of the Church and people of Sardis, which
was a dead people, and therefore Christ was able to quicken
them, and to put life and spirit into them.</p>
            <p>That no man can haue fellowship with the Father,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> or the holy
Ghost but by Christ, it is manifest by other places: <hi>No man can
come to the Father but by me:</hi> so there must be a participation
with Christ, before there can be any with the holy Ghost.</p>
            <p>This serueth for our instruction, because among the Papists
there be many great learned men, which haue excellent gifts
of nature, wit, memorie, and vnderstanding: and though
they haue withall a reformed and ciuill life, yet they want faith
and regeneration. How cometh this to passe? that such worthy
men hauing the common gifts of the spirit, want the speciall?
The cause is this: their Christ is a false Christ, yea an idol Christ:
they professe the want of sauing faith, and all is, because they
want Christ. Therefore no maruell though you see the greatest
learned there, mocke and scoffe at this speciall grace of the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
of our election. Againe, many among vs looke to be
saued by Christ, and yet you shall see no grace, neither of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
nor faith, feare nor care to keepe Gods commandements
or a good conscience, no sparke of grace, and yet looke to be
saued by Christ. How can these stand together? Though they
say they haue Christ, they deceiue themselues: for they haue not
the graces of the Spirit, and they haue no grace, because they
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:14859:136"/>
are not in Christ: and by that they may know they are not in
Christ, because they haue no grace. To conclude then, we must
all be admonished to labour that we may be vnited to Christ
our head truly, to haue fellowship with him, that in him we may
haue fellowship with the Father and the holy Ghost. No grace
of God to life eternall will be bestowed vpon vs, till we haue
Christ himselfe. Therefore first labour to be in Christ, and to be
truly ioyned and vnited to him by the bond of faith, that by
this meanes we may haue all graces distilling and flowing into
our hearts by Christ.</p>
            <p>Now the second royaltieis, he hath <hi>seue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> starres:</hi> that is, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
and Pastors of the seuen Churches. Christ is said here to
haue them, because he is the soueraigne Lord ouer them: he is
an absolute Lord ouer all. For he setteth them apart, and giueth
them whatsoeuer gifts they haue: he appointeth them their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
duties, and callings; so as he hath rule ouer them, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointeth,
ordaineth, maketh and preserueth them. As he hath
in him the fulnesse of spirit, so is he a Lord ouer his Ministers,
he hath power to saue if they obey; or to destroy, if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell.
<hi>Ob.</hi> The Church maketh Ministers. <hi>Ans.</hi> The right of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Ministers and ordaining them, is Christs royaltie, and
belongeth to him, the Church doth but testifie and declare
who they be that Christ maketh Ministers, and approueth them:
therefore he saith here, the seuen starres be his. Now the end of
these words is to strike the heart of the Minister which is se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
and negligent, to make him know himselfe and his place,
that he may begin to haue sound conscience of his dutie. And
this point is an excellent motiue to make them looke to their
dutie: their gifts are not their owne, nay they themselues are not
their owne, but Christs; and he is their Lord. This very consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
cannot but be effectuall to stirre vp all pastors to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
their duties: for seeing they are Christs, they must not do
their owne will. We must renounce our selues in all things, and
therefore bethinke our selues: our soules and our bodies,
are not our owne but Christs.</p>
            <p>Let this consideration draw vs on to do, thinke, and speake
nothing, but that which Christ would: if he will haue you liue,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:14859:137"/>
be content, because he is the Lord of your life; if to dye, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
because you are his, and not your owne. So much for the
Preface.</p>
            <p>Now followeth the second part of the Epistle containing
two parts: first, a reproofe: secondly, a promise. The reproofe in
the first verse: <hi>I know thy works:</hi> in which is contained a reproof,
and withall a remedie in the next words: <hi>I know.</hi> Here note the
vice, and withall the reproofe: the vice is hypocrisie; for she pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
religion in outward shew, but wanted it indeed. <hi>Thou
hast a name:</hi> that is, the Churches about thee iudge thee to liue,
that is, to be borne anew, beleeue in Christ, &amp; to haue his spirit
to guide thee: but thou art dead in sinnes, and wantest newnesse
of life and regeneration. The like we may say of many great
Churches: by name, the Romish Church, which though it
seeme to liue, yet in regard of spirituall life it is dead. It preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
to be the true Church of Christ, but in truth it is dead in
sinne. Yet some say, it is not dead, but diseased, full of sores and
sicknesses; and though the throat be cut, yet it breatheth and
panteth: but the truth is, it is starke dead and cold, it hath no
spirituall life at all. But some alleage the contrarie, saying, it
hath the Sacraments in it; and where there is a Sacrament,
there is a Church: but they haue Baptisme, therefore a Church.
<hi>Ans.</hi> Baptisme is not alwaies a note of a true Church: for the
Samaritanes had circumcision, which was before Baptisme, yet
they were no people nor church of God. <hi>Os.</hi> 1. 9. That there may
be baptisme &amp; yet no church, it appeareth, because there may
be baptisme without the preaching of the word. As the Papists
haue baptisme without the true preaching of the word: so they
haue the outward Baptisme, but deny the inward Baptisme,
which is iustification by Christ, and sanctification by his Spirit.
Againe I answer, it is a Sacrament, not to that church of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
but to the hidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> church in popery: for the Lord euer hath
his church among them, he keepeth among them euen 7. thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
which neuer worshipped their idols. Now then, that
Sacrament is reserued in that church, not for the Papists, but for
Gods children among them. By this we see Gods owne proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
to call them by those meanes, and for their sakes he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:14859:137"/>
the word and Sacraments among them. But they say,
Antichrist sitteth in the middest of Gods temple: but Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
as we say, is in the Romish church: therefore that is the
temple of God. <hi>Ans.</hi> The true Church of God is among them,
but it is hidden. Now he sitteth in the midst of them, not as a
member but as an vsurper, theefe and deceiuer: for the Church
of God is in their Church, as wheate among chaffe, and gold in
drosse. And the like may be said, though not in regard of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
yet in regard of life, of al our greatest townes in England,
for the body of them they seeme to liue, if we looke on their
outward seruice of God and shew, yet indeed they be dead,
which appeareth by the common sinnes now in prosperitie, as
pride inward and outward, fulnesse of bread, carelesnesse in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:
though we haue now the word plentifully preached, yet
we seeming to liue are stark dead. Yet the Lord hath his church
amongst vs, but the body of our people though they haue the
word preached, yet they will not be reformed. But as a father
which cannot reforme his sonne by words, must vse the rod: so
the Lord when as the preaching of the word will not serue, he
must needs take the rod in his hand, to make vs obey his will, to
reform our liues, to trie which be his own childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; which not.</p>
            <p>Christ before called these seuen churches his true church,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> yet
here we see this church hath corruptions in it: so that a church
may haue corruption in opinion and doctrine, and yet if it erre
not in fundamentall points, it may be the true church of God,
and we must not condemne a church for corruptions in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou hast a name.</hi> Other churches iudged of this church by
the rule of charity: seeing them to make shew of religion, and to
professe the Gospell, they iudged it to be a true church. So must
we, so long as we see men liue outwardly in the feare of God,
professe religion, iudge of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in charitie, til we see some euident
signe, and commit secret iudgement to God. We see all infants
are not the children of God, yet we admit all, iudge wel of them
in charitie, coming of beleeuing parents; and <hi>Paul</hi> calleth all the
churches he wrote vnto elect, by the rule of charitie, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

<pb n="256" facs="tcp:14859:138"/>
Christs iudgement is, thou art dead: then we must regard espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the iudgement of Christ, and not care so much to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued
of the church (though that be good) as to be approued of
Christ, which cannot erre: for though the church approue and

               <hi>Verse. 2. Be awake and strengthen the things ready to die.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the reproofe followeth first the remedy, secondly, the
reason. In the remedy, note two duties: first, to be watchfull:
secondly, to confirme the graces of God decayed in them. In
that first he commaunds them to be watchfull, we see it is an
excellent dutie; and then is a man watchfull when he hath great
circumspection and heedinesse in respect of the saluation of his
soule. This dutie concerneth two things, namely sin and death:
for we are commanded in the word to watch against these two.
Against sin in two things: first, for a man to bethinke himselfe of
all the sins he may fall into: to do this, he must consider, first his
nature, secondly his calling. First his nature, that there is in it
the seed of all sinne, <hi>ergo</hi> he may fall into all sin: secondly, a man
shall find that he is more inclined to one sinne then to another,
and against that he must labour most. Secondly, for his calling,
we must know that euery calling hath his sinnes since the fall of
man. Now a man must consider which be the especial sins of his
calling, and when a man seeth them, he shall know by these two
into what sins he may fall, and against them he must watch. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
thing is, to keepe the heart that it be not tainted with any
sinne. <hi>Pro.</hi> 4. 24. aboue all watch and ward, keepe thy heart, that
is, vse all good meanes to keepe thy heart cleane from all
sinne.</p>
            <p>The second part of watchfulnesse is in death, against the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of Christ at iudgement vnto vs, or in particular by death, in
which note two things: first, to bethinke our selues of Christs
coming to iudgement, or to come to vs in particular, and in this
regard we must make account that euery day is the day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
Christ will come, either in generall or particular iudgement.
The second dutie is, to prepare our selues against Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
to make vs ready to die euery houre, as if Christ would
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:14859:138"/>
come euen this day, so to morrow, and euery day. That we may
do this, we must vse sobrietie and temperancie in all the things
of this life, moderately to vse them, not to be drowned with the
pleasures &amp; profits of this life: for we the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> forget the time of death.
And as Christ prescribeth the remedie to Sardis, so to vs: we are
not better then they: we take great care to prepare for the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
of this life. If a towne were in danger to be sacked, or a
house to be robbed, we would set watch and ward to guard the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
how much more shold we watch for the saluation of our soules,
and not hazard them at death for want of watchfulnesse? The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
reason to moue vs to watch, is the want of watchfulnesse,
and securitie, which is the fore-runner of destruction. 1. <hi>Thes. 5.
3. When men cry peace, then cometh destruction. Luk.</hi> 12. When
the rich man thought all was safe, then came destruction, and
his soule was taken from him. When the old world thought no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
then came the floud and swept them away. This should
admonish vs to take heed to prepare our selues, and watch both
against sinne and death, vnlesse we will cast away our soules.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And strengthen.</hi> Here is the second dutie, which is the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of the decayed graces. As if he should say, thou hast had
many graces, whereof diuerse are lost, and many are sore decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
therefore labour to recouer and strengthen them. Where
Christ teacheth vs, that if we haue any gift of God, we must la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to preserue it, and not onely that, but to increase and grow
on, and strengthen it: we must not stand in one estate, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
in good workes, that we may become perfect men in
Christ, by growing in grace as in dayes: for our gifts are not
our owne but Gods, we are his stewards, he looketh to haue his
owne with aduantage, else we are vnprofitable seruants. Then
we must stirre vp the gifts of God in vs: and to do so, we must
often and daily reade the Scriptures, daily heare them and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate
on the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vse the Sacraments often, vse often prayer and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation,
and striue daily against our owne corruptions, and
withall stirre vp our hearts to good things, and to true obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
<hi>Psal. 119. Dauid</hi> saith: I haue inclined my heart, euen my
dead heart, and put life into it: and so we must put life into our
benummed soules, and often call on them which are halfe dead.
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:14859:139"/>
But we commonly stand still, seeke not to grow, but stand at
a stay. Christ by these words would signifie, that some be dead,
other graces be readie to die: whence we haue answer to that
question, whether grace may be vtterly lost? We say some gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
may, othersome cannot be lost, but sore decayed and dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.
For Gods graces are of two sorts: some necessarie to
saluation, as faith and regeneration: some are lesse necessarie,
which go not with sauing faith: as sensible and full feeling of
Gods fauour, ioy in the holy Ghost, earnest inuocation on Gods
name. Now these may be separated from faith, and be wholy
lost in the seruants of God for a time: the other cannot, though
they may be sore diminished: nay, faith and regeneration consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, may be lost wholy: for nothing is vnchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in it owne nature, but God. The grace by which the elect
Angels stand, is in it selfe chaungeable, and these would perish
and come to nothing vnlesse they were continually preserued,
kept and confirmed in vs and them. If this be so, why then
do not the elect fall away? <hi>Ans.</hi> Not because they haue faith and
regeneration, or that they be in themselues vnchangeable, but
because of Gods promises: as <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. Christ saith, that <hi>the
gates of hell,</hi> (though they shew their violence,) <hi>shall not preuaile
against Peters faith:</hi> so that these graces are eternall, not of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
but by Gods promise, which will preserue them to the
end.<note place="margin">Vse.</note> Now seeing grace may be lost, we must not be too confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
if we haue any grace in vs, but worke out our saluation
with feare and trembling: for they may come to that ebbe, that
they may be at the point of death.</p>
            <p>Now followeth the reason of the remedie: <hi>For I haue not
found, &amp;c.</hi> therefore <hi>watch and seeke to restore thy decayed graces.
I haue not found.</hi> Here Christ signifieth, that he made a search in
this Church, and that to reward them either with life or death.
And so this was the practise of Christ when he came to Sodom,
he went downe to search it. So <hi>Gen.</hi> 11. the Lord came downe
to see Babel: the like is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Ierem. 9. And the Lord he visiteth,</hi> that
is, he enquireth of the sinnes of the fathers in the children, and if
he find them, he punisheth them in the children. And alwaies
Christ first maketh inquirie; and after search made, he rewardeth
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:14859:139"/>
accordingly. The like will Christ do with vs, therefore we must
labour to be such as he may approue of. If a Magistrate were to
search our houses, we would see that nothing should be amisse:
how much more when Christ the heauenly Prince (which sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
the heart, and cannot be deceiued) cometh to search vs,
that he may approue of vs and reward vs?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But found thee not perfect.</hi> There is a twofold perfection: one
of the law, another of the Gospell. Of the law, when we satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the whole law: of the Gospell, when our workes done pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from a beleeuing heart, which is carefull to please God in
all things. Now though no worke of man be perfect, yet those
workes coming from a heart full of faith are perfect in Christ,
God accepting the will and indeuour for the deed, through
Christ.</p>
            <p>Christ he searched, and found in this church many goodly
works, in shew only: for they were full of hypocrisie, made shew
of godlinesse, but wanted the power thereof, neither did they
come from an heart full of faith, or that indeuoured to please
God, not to sinne in any thing: therefore they were not perfect
and pleasing to God. In that this church is reproued, not for
want of workes, and those faire in shew, but because they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
not from a beleeuing and honest heart; learne to pray
as <hi>Dauid, Psal. 119. 80. Lord, let my heart be vpright,</hi> let me
giue all diligence to please thee in al things. This is a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
when one can say in his conscience, My heart is vpright:
but hypocrisie is the killing of the soule.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Before God.</hi> Christ seemeth to distinguish himselfe from God.
But he speaketh not of God simply, but of the Father, and of
himselfe as he is the Mediator, and so is inferiour to the Father,
though he be now in glorie. Now seeing he is in heauen, and in
glorie there, yet carieth himselfe as Mediator, we may pray to
him, without helpe of Angell or Saint, and it is no presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
seeing he is still by his owne confession Mediator, and so
carieth himselfe toward vs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remember.</hi> Here, after the remedie, Christ as a good Pastour
of the soule, sheweth how to vse the same: namely, first, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber:
secondly, hold fast: thirdly, repent. In practising of which
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:14859:140"/>
three, standeth the remedie of hypocrisie. <hi>Remember:</hi> that is,
call to mind the doctrine of saluation taught by my Apostles.
This remembrance is a most excellent dutie, and bringeth with
it many graces, as subiection to Gods will, repentance, &amp;c. <hi>Psal.
73. Dauid</hi> seeing the prosperitie of the wicked, had almost slipt,
and was sore tempted: he could not be rid of his temptation, till
he went into the sanctuarie of God: that is, till he knew the
word of God. <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 55. He kept the commaundement of
God, because he remembred his name in the night season. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
remembred Christs words, and so repented at the crowing
of a cocke, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. And indeed, the cause of all sinne, is forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
of the word of God. Therefore <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. euery sinne is
called ignorance, because we commit sinne, not remembring
and knowing Gods word: and if we could keep in liuely memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
the word of God, it were not possible that we should sin
as we do. Then it is a most excellent meanes to cut off sinne, to
haue the word of God running in our minds, forbidding sinne
in vs. And the Diuell he laboureth aboue all things to make vs
forget the word, for then he can draw vs easily to sinne. Now
that we may haue the word continually in memorie, we must
labour to haue our hearts affected with the same: for we cannot
remember more then we like and affect. Then we must beleeue
it, else we cannot remember: for that we beleeue not, slippeth
soone out of our memorie. And the cause why so few remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the word, is, because they be not affected and delighted
with it, nor beleeue it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That thou hast heard and receiued.</hi> That is, that doctrine which
by hearing and receiuing thou hast learned. Seeing he puts hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and receiuing together, we gather that this is the ordinary
meanes of saluation, to heare and receiue the word preached.
Then God calleth not all men in all times,<note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note> seeing men in all ages
haue not heard the word, neither receiued it: and if they haue
not heard the doctrine of saluation by Christ in all ages, they
could not be called; for first they must heare, and then be called.
In this last age only the word is sent to al natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: it was not so in
former ages.<note place="margin">Vse. 2.</note> Againe, false it is that God giueth grace generally
to all men, so that euery particular man hath grace offered to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:14859:140"/>
if he wil receiue it: but God gaue not the word to all: for
all haue not heard, therefore they could not haue grace.</p>
            <p>The second dutie is, <hi>to hold fast:</hi> this signifieth two things:
first to maintaine the doctrine taught by the Apostles, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
of them: secondly, to practise the same in their life: but of
these before.</p>
            <p>The third dutie is, <hi>to repent:</hi> that is, though she repented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
yet she must restore and renew her repentancce. Hence we
learne, that we must not only begin, but often renew our repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and not onely for great sins, but for litle slips and defects
in grace, as dulnesse of heart, want of zeale, coldnes in practise
of religion, &amp;c. Now because this Church was ready to die,
Christ addeth a reason, to put life into her, if she haue any grace.
<hi>If thou wilt not, I will come on thee as a theefe:</hi> A most terrible
threatning: if thou wilt not renew thy repentance, restore that
grace decayed in thee, <hi>I will come as a theefe sodainly,</hi> and with
speedy destruction, that thou shalt haue no time or way to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape
it. Note here, that this threatning is not absolute, but with
condition, and it is the most terrible commination in the whole
word of God, where Christ threatneth to powre out his whole
wrath on a Church, so as they shall haue no time or meanes to
escape it.</p>
            <p>Then we hauing the same sin that she had,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> being dead in secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
by reason of our long prosperity, we had need of this admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
to moue vs to watchfulnesse, to restore Gods graces de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed
in vs: yet it seemes we make light account of all these
things. If a man had any sparke of grace this would stirre him vp,
but if this most fearefull commination will not moue vs, then
the end of all must needs follow, euen the heauy wrath and
iudgement of God must lay hold on vs, and cast vs into eternall
destruction, where is no hope of helpe, for then a man might
haue some comfort, if after a long time she should get out, but he
must liue there for euer: without al end of pain: when he hath bin
there a thousand yeare his paine is still as great and as much,
nay no end he can haue. Then we must awake from our sins, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
for our sins, our securitie, dulnesse and coldnes in religion,
stirre vp the graces of God in vs, shake off our ignorance; and
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:14859:141"/>
that because against these sins Christ giueth out this most terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and fearefull commination.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vers. 4. Notwithstanding thou hast a few names.</hi> Before Christ
had reproued this church of hypocrisie, now he commends her
for a few which professe his name among them. But Christ had
said before, that the church was dead: how then can this be a
true church? <hi>Ans.</hi> Though the body of the Church were dead in
sin, yet a few, some of them were true beleeuers, and testified their
faith in obedience.</p>
            <p>Out of this coherence we haue two instructions to learne:
first, that a particular church and congregation, is called a church
in regard of the better sort and part, and those which beleeue
in Christ, and haue the priuiledges: also in regard of the better
part which beleeue: for the Catholicke Church is a number
of men on earth beleeuing in Christ. Now the particular church
is a member of the Catholicke Church, so farre as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
in Christ. Those which beleeue not, are no part of the true
church: but as bad humors in the body are no true parts of the
body, so these are no true parts of the Church. Secondly, we see
a distinction betweene man and man in this church, though all
be called, yet some called be dead, some aliue in Christ, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
so. Now the cause of this distinction is, not from the will
of man, but from the good pleasure of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 4. The
whole body of the Israelites fell to idolatry, yet the Lord had
seuen thousand which bowed not the knee to <hi>Baal.</hi> What is the
cause of this? not the will of man: but I haue reserued seuen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
which haue not bowed to <hi>Baal,</hi> saith the Lord. So then his
will and good pleasure is the cause why some stand and some
fall. So the cause why some in this church of Sardis liued, some
were dead, is because the Lord in his good pleasure left some
to themselues, and to othersome he gaue his spirit. This, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
confutes vniuersall grace, which derogates much from the
grace of God. For this, why some stand, some fall, comes from
and higher cause, euen from the power and will of God, which
leaueth some to themselues, and inableth some to stand by his
spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou hast a few names.</hi> Here is the commendation of
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:14859:141"/>
the better part of the church, there be yet a few per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
knowne to me by their names, <hi>which haue not defiled their
garments.</hi> Here he alludeth to the ceremoniall law, for the Lord
in the ceremoniall law, made a distinction betweene things
cleane and vncleane, not in themselues, but by his appointment.
Now among the Iewes, if a man with his hand or garment tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
a thing vncleane, he was defiled: which ceremony signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to them, that they should abstaine not onely from sin, but all
appearance of euill, in that they might not touch any vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane
thing, no not with their garments. Then here Christ
would shew there were sundry in Sardis, which did abstain both
from sin and all occasions, shews, and appearances of sin: though
the body of the church were dead, yet many in Sardis made
such conscience of sin, that they auoided the very occasions of
sinne.</p>
            <p>Hence we see,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> that the seruants of God be few in number, the
bodie of the church is dead in sin; but a few be so far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sin, that
they defile not their garments, that is, auoid all occasions of sin.
Christ prepareth the kingdome of heauen for a litle flocke. <hi>Esay</hi>
saith, only the best part of the Iewes must be saued, the rest har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened:
and the way to hell is broade and easie, and many runne
that way; the way to heauen is contrary. <hi>Mark.</hi> 7. 7. Then seeing
the seruants of God be few, we must not follow the multitude:
but this sin carieth many a man to hell, and to sin, when men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to do as the most do, to liue as the most liue; we must rather
follow the litle flocke of Christ, and not runne after the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A few names.</hi> That is, persons knowne to Christ by their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
names: they be called <hi>names,</hi> because Christ writeth their
names in a bill. Then we see Christ knoweth his seruants parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
by their names: <hi>Luke</hi> 10. he knoweth all our haires,
much more our names. <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. Christ calleth his sheep by their
names.</p>
            <p>This is a speciall comfort for vs,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> to know that our names par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
are knowne to Christ, and be written in his bil which is
the King of heauen and earth.</p>
            <p>The Lord to comfort <hi>Moses</hi> in trouble, vsed this, that <hi>he kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:14859:142"/>
him by his name:</hi> and so should it be to vs that our names are
knowne to Christ, and he will accordingly help vs. 2. <hi>Timoth.</hi> 2.
there it is made the foundation of saluation, <hi>that the Lord know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
who be his.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Which haue not defiled.</hi> These were commended for sinceritie
and vprightnesse of life and conuersation: though the rest of the
church were dead, yet these were aliue, and kept themselues
from all appearance of sin. Now Christ commending them, he
leaueth in them a patterne of sinceritie for vs to follow, to be as a
looking glasse, to see how we should professe religion. We must
not onely know and speake of the Gospell, but we must liue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
we must keep our garments fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pollutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, liue without
al occasion of sin: and that we may liue sincerely, we must first ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al sin in our own persons, take heed we practise no sin.
Secondly, we must take heed of contagion of sin, not partake in
other mens sins, by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent or winking at them, or giuing counsel
to sin. Thirdly, we must abstaine from all occasions of sinne, from
all appearance of euill, we must not once name sin, nor giue the
least approbation thereof, <hi>Let not fornication be named among you.
Eph.</hi> 5. Then we must behold this patterne, labor to be like them,
that Christ may commend vs as he did them: and this we must
do by liuing well, for religion stands not in knowledge but in
practise, and by doing these three, that is, abstaining from the
practise of all sinne, from the contagion of sin, and from all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation
to sin, we shall imitate them and become a most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
people, and a worthy church of Christ. Out of this place
the Papists gather, that a man after baptisme may liue without al
mortall sins, for these few, hauing put on Christ, liued free from
all sinne, nay from all appearance of sin. But first though they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
so till this time, yet how proue they they liued so after? se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
they be said to keepe their garments vndefiled, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they sinned not at all, but because they liued and endeuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in constant purpose not to sinne, but in all things to please
God: and so the Lord accepts their will and constant endeuour,
for the deed, and they be righteous before God, and no sinners,
but keepers of the law.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And these shall walke with me in white.</hi> Here after the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:14859:142"/>
is a promise, <hi>to walk,</hi> that is, liue, <hi>in white,</hi> that is, in ioy
and happinesse. <hi>Eccles. 9. 8. Let thy garments be white:</hi> that is, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce
and take thy lawfull pleasure, in the things of this life. The
church before was threatned to haue Christ as iudge, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
them, but these few they shall not taste of his wrath, but be
with Christ for euer in glory and happinesse. By which we see,
that men which communicate not with the sins of townes, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
or nations, shall not partake in iudgement with them. <hi>Lot</hi>
liued in Sodom, yet his righteous soule was not partaker of their
sins, neither was it of their punishment, <hi>Gen. 19. Ezech.</hi> 6. 9. they
which mourned for the sins of the people were marked, and in
the destruction not touched. By reason of our long peace, sins
abound, so that there is plentie of sin, of contempt of the word,
of religion, &amp;c. These sins call for iudgment, and wil haue iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
now if we would escape this iudgement, we must take
heed we communicate not with these sins, and then we shall es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape,
though we liue in Sodome.</p>
            <p>After the promise, followeth a reason of the same: <hi>For they be
worthy.</hi> Hence the Papists gather, that a man by his workes may
merit heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, because here they be worthy of reward, &amp; be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to walke with Christ in glory. But I answer, all true seruants
of God be worthy of life euerlasting, because God the father
giueth Christ to euery true beleeuer: so that euery beleeuer may
truly say, Christ is mine: and withall he giueth the spirit of
Christ, which stirreth vp in the heart true iustifying faith, which
layeth hold on Christ, applieth him and all his righteousnesse.
Now Christ being giuen to vs by God, and receiued of vs by
faith, is wholly ours, and his righteousnesse is made ours by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
so that Christ with all his benefits is truly ours: and
when one stands thus iustified in Christ, and clothed with his
righteousnesse, he is said to be worthy of saluation, not for any
thing of his owne, but for Christs righteousnesse: for there is a
double righteousnesse, one of the person, as when Christs righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse
is imputed to vs: another of the work, as when a work
is done answerable to the rigour of the law, and then it is meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious.
Now Christ speaketh here of the worthinesse of the
person, not of the worke of the person, standing righteous in
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:14859:143"/>
Christs righteousnesse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Verse 5. To him which ouercometh.</hi> Here is the conclusion: in
it note two parts: first, a promise: secondly, a commaundement:
of these before. <hi>To him which ouercometh:</hi> that is, which getteth
victory ouer all his spirituall enemies: which we do, by holding
faith and a good conscience in all things to the end: and this is,
first the partie to whom.</p>
            <p>Seeing that the promises are euer made to him which ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh,
we must labour to haue that estate; in conscience truly
to say, we haue laboured in all things to keepe faith and a good
conscience, and to thinke it a miserable estate to be ouercome
of any enemy, be it sin, the diuell, the world, or our flesh. I come
to the thing promised, which is threefold in words, but one in
substance, namely glory, happines, and life euerlasting. First, <hi>He
shall be clothed in white aray,</hi> that is, with eternall glory, happines,
and life.</p>
            <p> Out of this the Papists gather, that a man may do a good work
in respect of reward. It is true indeed, one may do so, as <hi>Moses</hi>
had respect to the recompence of reward, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. 26. yet that
must not be the principall end, but faith to edifie the church and
other men; &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we may do it to receiue eternal life as a reward.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And will not cut his name out of the booke of life.</hi> Here two que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
must be assoiled. 1. What is the book of life? 2. Whether one
can be blotted out of it? for thou hast the booke of life in Gods
predestination, or his decree in election, by which he hath ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
some men to life in his good pleasure: &amp; this decree of God
is called in a resemblance the booke of life. For as a General in
the field hath his book, wherein he writes al his souldiers names:
and a Magistrate keepes a record, writing in it all the citizens of
that citie; so God hath his decree, wherein he writes the names
of all those whom he will saue in his secret counsell.</p>
            <p>The second question is: Whether one can be put out of this
booke? <hi>Ans.</hi> A man is written in this booke two wayes: first, in
the iudgement of God truly: secondly, in the iudgement of men.
Now if a man be truly written in the counsell of God, then he
cannot be put out: but if he be onely in the iudgement of men,
he may be blotted out. For the first, they cannot, because Gods
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:14859:143"/>
counsell is vnchangeable: and <hi>(Rom. 8.)</hi> whom he predestinates
he calleth, iustifieth, and sanctifieth. This golden chaine cannot
be broken, but whom he predestinateth he glorifieth, <hi>ergo</hi> they
cannot fall finally. As for the other, being onely in the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of men, as all be liuing in the church professing Christ,
these may be put out. Psal. 69. <hi>Let them be blotted out of the booke
of life:</hi> he prayeth that they might be manifested, that they were
neuer indeed in the booke of life.</p>
            <p>Hence, first we see the number of the elect is certaine, for their
names are in Gods bill, they cannot be put out, but remaine for
euer. This then is no vniuersall election: for what neede God
a bill or booke to write in some, if all were elected? Seeing some
men being in this booke onely in the iudgement of men, may
be blotted out, and manifested to men to be but hypocrites: then
we must take heed of all sin, and make conscience of euery sinne;
for so often as we sin, we reach vp a pen to heauen to crosse our
names, to blot them out as much as in vs lieth. Let vs then looke
to haue our consciences assured that we be in that booke: which
we may, if we find our consciences free from all sin, and from all
appearance of sin. But some godlesse person will hence gather, I
will liue as I list, for if I be in the booke of life I shall be saued; if
not damned, liue how I can. But these deceiue themselues, for if
their names be in it, they cannot liue in sin, but in faith and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
in newnesse of life and repentance: for he which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destinated
is iustified, and must liue in repentance and faith: and
as surely as he shall be saued, he shall liue in faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>I will confesse him in the kingdom of heauen.</hi> That is, at the last day
I wil take him for mine: he which thus ouercometh and liueth in
faith &amp; a good conscience, I wil confesse him to belong to me, to
be my me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, I wil separate him from al the world, and take him
to my selfe, and pronounce to him the sentence of absolution,
<hi>Come thou blessed of my Father,</hi> Math. 25. The end why Christ
propounds this third blessing, is to moue euery person in the
church of Sardis, to confesse Christ in this world: for he reasons
thus, If thou shalt confesse me before men, I wil confesse thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
my Father: if not, I will deny thee, euen before my Father.
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:14859:144"/>
And so to vs, if we will haue Christ confesse vs before God, we
must confesse him before men, and let no creature make vs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
him, but stand out against all his enemies, euen against
the gates of hel and the diuel, which is indeed a hard matter for
flesh &amp; blood; yet Christ perswades vs to do it, &amp; to take paines
to professe him before all men, for he will confesse vs before
God. If a King should come in company, and choose out one,
and come to salute him familiarly, call him by his name, and take
him by the hand, that would be a great credit: but what a happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
is it to haue Christ Iesus King of all kings to come and call
vs by our names, take vs by the hands, confesse vs to be his
friends, and pronounce the sentence of absolution before God,
his Angels, the diuel and all men, euen our enemies?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vers. 7. And write vnto the Church of Philadelpha.</hi> Here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth
the sixth particular Epistle, reaching to the fourteenth
verse. And as before euery particular Epistle, was set downe a
particular commandement, to write: so here Christ giueth <hi>Iohn</hi>
a particular commandement to write: the end of which comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement,
is to warrant <hi>Iohns</hi> calling, as before often I haue
shewed.</p>
            <p>The Epistle hath three parts: first, the Preface: secondly, the
matter: thirdly, the conclusion. The Preface is in the seuenth
verse, and it sheweth in whose name this Epistle was written:
to wit, in the name of Christ. And as in other Epistles Christ
was described, to get credit to the Epistle: so is he here by two
properties: first, of <hi>holinesse:</hi> secondly, of <hi>truth:</hi> besides, he is des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
by his kingly office: <hi>which hath the keyes of Dauid.</hi> The 1
propertie of Christ is, he is <hi>holy.</hi> But how can Christ be holy,
seeing he cometh of <hi>Adam,</hi> as he is man? To this many answer,
that Christ tooke his substance indeed from <hi>Adam,</hi> yet so sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
as that it is free from all sinne. This, though it be true, yet
is not sufficient: for as we take from <hi>Adam</hi> the corruption of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
so we haue from him the guilt of sin. Now though sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
taketh away corruption of nature, yet it taketh not away
the guilt of sinne. Then the true answer is this: All which come
of <hi>Adam</hi> by naturall generation, and that commaundement
which God gaue in the creation, <hi>Increase and multiply,</hi> they take
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:14859:144"/>
from <hi>Adam</hi> both corruption of nature aud guilt of sin: for both
be equally conueyed to vs from <hi>Adam.</hi> But God, to preuent
this, ordained that Christ should be borne, not by naturall gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
but by a miraculous conception: and so though he take
of man mans nature, yet he taketh not mans sinne, which he
should as well haue had, if he had come by ordinarie and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
generation. Now in that it is said, Christ is <hi>holy,</hi> note that
he is so, first, in regard of himselfe: secondly, of vs &amp; his church.
In regard of himselfe, first, as he is God: his Godhead is holy,
nay his diuine nature is holinesse it selfe: there is no difference
betweene Christ as he is God, and his holinesse. Secondly, in
regard of his humane nature, it was not onely free from all sin,
but filled with all holinesse, aboue all men and Angels: he had
the holy Ghost without measure. Thirdly, in his actions he was
holy, as in his actuall obedience and fulfilling the law. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Christ is holy in regard of his Church, euen of vs his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
because he is the author of all holinesse in vs, we haue all
our holinesse from him, nay, he is the very roote of holinesse;
not as the Father, or the holy Ghost, but in a more speciall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
because from Christ as the roote, springeth holinesse in all
his members. And as from <hi>Adam</hi> (being the root in whom all
mankind stood) was conueyed sin and corruption to all which
came of him: so from Christ, being the roote, is conueyed holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to all his members in him: he is our sanctification, because
we fetch our righteousnesse from him, as a branch doth sappe
from the root: for the humane nature of Christ is the very root
from whence is conueyed to vs all righteousnesse.</p>
            <p>Seeing Christ is holy,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> both in himselfe and in vs, yea the root
of all holinesse, we must note this maine principle of all true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:
which is, to be set and ingraffed into Christ as a branch
into a tree, and being once in him, to become new creatures, to
labour to feele the power of Christ killing in vs the old man,
our naturall corruptions, and also renewing in vs the new man,
and the image of God, in righteousnesse and true holinesse, to
feele the power and vertue of Christ as sensibly in vs, as we feele
the corruption of nature, and shew this vertue we receiue of
Christ, euen as a branch sheweth the sappe it receiueth from the
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:14859:145"/>
roote, by the leaues and fruite.</p>
            <p>2 Seeing Christ was thus holy, he propoundeth to vs a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne
to follow, teaching vs to be holy as he was holy, to make
conscience of al sinne, to be conformable to him, to marke what
he did, and to imitate it. 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 4. We must purge our selues
of sinne, and be pure as he is pure: for he which is not holy as he
is holy, shall haue no benefit or fellowship by his death and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
Thirdly we see, that title giuen to the Bishop of Rome is
blasphemous, to call him <hi>Holinesse,</hi> as it is common in all their
speeches to him. Now he in that taketh to him the title of Christ
which is a part of Christs honour, communicable to none else:
nay, he taketh more on him then Christ here doth: for Christ is
called but <hi>holy,</hi> he is called <hi>holinesse</hi> it selfe.</p>
            <p>The second title of Christ, is <hi>truth.</hi> Christ is called true in
three respects: first, because without errour and ignorance he
knoweth al things as they be in themselues: so do not creatures,
but by vertue from him. Secondly, because what he willeth and
decreeth, he willeth and decreeth seriously, without fraud, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt,
or any contradiction, as appeareth in the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
wherein is nothing contrarie to it selfe, but all without
chaunge and alteration. Thirdly, because he maketh good all his
promises in his word, he accomplisheth and performeth them
all, he is the performance of the <hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, yea and Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seeing Christ is true,<note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note> nay, truth it self, we see a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
Christ and all false spirits, for they be spirits of errors:
the diuell is a lyer from the beginning, he is the father of lyes,
nay his nature is to lie, he can do nothing else: but Christ is true,
nay truth it selfe, euery way true, in his knowledge, in his will,
and in his promises, he is true.</p>
            <p>Seeing Christ is absolutely true,<note place="margin">Vse. 2.</note> we must beleeue in him, and
beleeue his promises in his word without doubting: for seeing
Christ is true, nay truth it selfe, what need we call his promises
into question? And this shold be the very prop of our faith, that
he which promiseth is true, &amp; therfore wil perform his promise.
So in persecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in trouble and affliction, trust in Christ, he hath
promised to helpe; he will not faile, because he is most true of
his promise.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="271" facs="tcp:14859:145"/>
Seeing he is so true,<note place="margin">Vse. 3.</note> he propoundeth himselfe to be followed
of vs. Christ he knoweth things truly, he willeth and decreeth
things seriously: so should we promise, and performe, and make
good our lawfull promises. <hi>Psal. 55. The Lord hateth the deceipt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
person. Reu. 20. without,</hi> that is in hell, <hi>be all deceiptfull and
lying persons. Psal.</hi> 15. It is a note of a member of the Church,
and of Christ, to be true and faithfull, and to speake truth from
his heart, for the diuell is the author of lies.</p>
            <p>3 Christ is described by his kingly office: <hi>which hath the keyes of
Dauid.</hi> First, let vs see what is meant by the key of <hi>Dauid. Esay</hi>
22. 22. speaking of <hi>Eliakim,</hi> saith: <hi>I will put the key of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid
vpon his shoulder:</hi> for <hi>Ezra</hi> had bene <hi>Hezechiahs</hi> Steward, an
ancient steward in many kingdomes: but in his dayes he began
to be negligent in his dutie, therfore he decreed to cast him out,
and to place <hi>Eliakim</hi> in his stead, <hi>(2. King. 18. 18.)</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
saith, he will put the <hi>key of Dauid,</hi> that is, the gouernement
of the kingdome of Iudah on his shoulder: for by <hi>Dauids</hi> house
is meant the kingdome of <hi>Dauid;</hi> and the giuing of the key, is
the placing and inuesting him into his office, and giuing him the
authoritie of the kingdome of <hi>Dauid.</hi> Christ here hath <hi>the key
of Dauid,</hi> great and large authoritie of the Churches, as a chiefe
Gouernor in a kingdome. It will be said, <hi>Dauids</hi> key was tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall,
Christs kingdome spirituall. <hi>Ans.</hi> First, Christ had <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids</hi>
key properly: for when Christ was borne, the scepter was
departed from Iudah to the Romaine Emperour; so that Christ
then was the next to it, and had true right to the crowne and
kingdome: <hi>Luk.</hi> 3. And Christ challenging his right, saith, <hi>(Mat.
17. 26.)</hi> That the Kings sonnes be free, and therefore he need
not to pay tribute.</p>
            <p>2 Christ had <hi>Dauids</hi> key typically and figuratiuely: for <hi>Dauids</hi>
te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall kingdome was a figure of Christs spirituall kingdome:
so <hi>Dauid</hi> was a figure and type of Christ, therefore he is often
called Christ: and <hi>Ezec.</hi> 3. Christ is called <hi>Dauid.</hi> Now he is
said to haue <hi>Dauids</hi> kingdome, and not <hi>Neroes</hi> or any other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
their kingdomes were kingdomes of darknesse and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
and cursed kingdomes: but <hi>Dauids</hi> kingdome was a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of light, a blessed kingdome, hauing those men which
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:14859:146"/>
were acceptable to God, and therefore was a type of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Christ. Then where Christ is said to haue <hi>Dauids</hi> key,
it is not so to be vnderstood, that he had the same with <hi>Dauid,</hi>
but that which is signified by <hi>Dauids</hi> key, Christ <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a <hi>Nazarite,</hi> not that he vsed their rites and customes: for he
dranke wine, they did not; but because he was that signified by
a Nazarite, namely, by <hi>Sampson, Iud.</hi> 13. For as he slue more by
his death, then by his life: so Christ he saued more by death then
by his life: yet Christ was a Nazarite, that is, seuered from all sin
and pollution. And so Christ had <hi>Dauids</hi> key, that is, the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
key signified by his temporall key, which key signifieth au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
power, and gouernment of the church of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Which openeth and none shutteth.</hi> In these words Christ hath
relation to an house, where, when one openeth the doore, he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth
the house: and so Christ, he openeth and he shutteth,
which sheweth his absolute and soueraigne authoritie: he hath
the key of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and he hath it absolutely, no creature is aboue
him, but he can shut or open at his pleasure. Now this <hi>key</hi> is the
power of Christ. <hi>In his hand,</hi> which is a supreme soueraignetie
ouer the church, by which he can saue or destroy. Now this so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne
power of Christ hath three parts: first, to prescribe: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
to iudge: thirdly, to saue and destory. First, to prescribe,
he hath an absolute power without constraint of any creature,
to commaund what he will haue done or not: so he propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
doctrine to mens consciences to be beleeued vpon paine
of eternall death. Christ sheweth in the bookes of the old and
new Testament, that no man can make one article of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe:
nay he which teacheth any other doctrine then that, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 1. Secondly, Christ hath absolute power to prescribe
regiment to his Church, how and in what maner, and also the
persons by whom it shall be gouerned. So <hi>Moses</hi> made the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle
according to the patterne Christ shewed him. <hi>Salomon</hi>
built the Temple according to the forme he saw by reuelation.
1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. 12. Thirdly, Christ hath authority to prescribe times
for his worship, to appoint Sabbaths, &amp;c. And <hi>(Gen. 1.)</hi> as he cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
the Sabbath, so hath he power alone to alter it, no creature
can prescribe a time to Gods seruice, to the end of the world,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:14859:146"/>
but Christ alone. Then it is not true, that the Church hath po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
to appoint two Sabbaths in one weeke, or one in many
weekes; for it is Christs honour to prescribe his worship, and
the time of the same.</p>
            <p>The second part of Christs soueraigne power, is to iudge,
to haue power to determine of his owne will, without helpe
of any man or Angell. And in this regard it belongeth to him to
giue sense of the Scriptures, he alone gaue them, he is the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuer,
and must expound his owne law. Secondly, Christ alone
must decide questions and controuersies concerning faith. Then
the Church hath not any such power, but from Christ, by helpe
of the written word, by which Christ expoundeth them to vs.</p>
            <p>The third part of this soueraigntie is, that Christ can <hi>saue and
destroy,</hi> open and shut, he alone hath the keys of heauen and hell:
he can open, that is, pardon sinne properly. And he alone pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth
this pardon, and can performe it being God: and as he
giueth the pardon for sinne, so he giueth also eternall life, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
mens soules. Secondly, he hath power to shut, to cast some
into hell, and to destroy, when men liue in sinnes and dye in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
without repentance: he hath power to hold men in sins, after to
cast them into hell, and shut them vp for euer.</p>
            <p>Seeing Christ prescribeth this doctrine to the soule and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,<note place="margin">Vse.</note>
to the most secret part of mans soule, &amp; such doctrine as
can saue and destroy: we see, Christ he is Lord of the Church,
he is Lord of the most secret wils and affections, of the chiefest
part of the mind. The Papists say, that by vertue of this key of
<hi>Dauid,</hi> Christ can set vp and depose kings and princes at his
pleasure: but this they hold, craftily to bring in the damned po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of the Pope. But it will do them no good: for Christ as he is
Mediator of the Church, and gouernour thereof, he deposeth
none, he maketh no king: but as he is God, so he maketh
and pulleth downe at his pleasure, being farre aboue all men.
And hence kings are called <hi>Gods,</hi> because they represent Christ
as he is God. Christ as he is Mediatour, maketh men spirituall
kings, but he maketh not temporall kings but onely as he is
God. For if he had such power, why did he refuse to deuide the
inheritance, saying, <hi>Who made me a Iudge?</hi> and to punish the
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:14859:147"/>
adulterous woman, confessing he was not a Magistrate.</p>
            <p>From this power is another deriued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christ: namely, <hi>the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of the keyes,</hi> which proceedeth from the power of Christ,
and by which power the key of <hi>Dauid</hi> is put in execution. <hi>Mat.
16. 19. I will giue thee the keyes of heauen.</hi> Now this power of the
keyes, is a ministerie granted to the Church of God, to open
and shut the kingdome of heauen. First, it is a ministerie, that is,
a seruice and dutie: for that which the Ministers do, is but a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
done to the Church, and they be but seruants and stewards
of Christ in the Church of God, in gouerning it. So then it is no
authoritie but a seruice. When <hi>Adam</hi> fell, we all fell in him,
and he thrust himselfe and all mankind out of Gods king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
by his sinne, &amp; closed vp heauen gates against vs. Now
since that fall, Christ became man, and in his manhood dyed for
our sinnes, and made satisfaction to God for them; and this sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
of Christ is the thing which properly openeth the
kingdome of heauen, and nothing else properly. Christ alone
can open and shut, the Church can only reueale and pronounce
the will of God: then no otherwise she openeth or shutteth, but
by declaring the same to be open or shut.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To the Church of God.</hi> That is, to the companie of true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers
called to saluation by Christ, to them onely is this key
giuen, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 18. the promise is made onely to the Church
and Gods people, not to all societies of men.</p>
            <p>The end of it is, <hi>to open and shut.</hi> How, Christ he knew best,
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 20. 23. where he sheweth, what is the key, and what to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
and shut: namely, to pardon and remit sinnes, and no way
else can men open and shut. Now we must distinguish betweene
giuing sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; pronouncing that sentence. The first belongs
to Christ alone; the second to man, who forgiueth sinne, not
by giuing sentence, but pronouncing sentence giuen alreadie
by Christ in heauen. And to make the church to forgiue sinnes
properly, is to robbe Christ of a speciall honor due to his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.
Then the right vse of the power of the keyes, is, when the
church of God vseth them onely in the name of Christ, to open
and shut: first, as his seruants and stewards: secondly, according
to his will and word, not mans traditions and affections. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:14859:147"/>
to bring sinners to saluation, to beget and continue them
in repentance. They being so vsed haue a promise: namely,
<hi>What you bind on earth, is bound in heauen, &amp;c.</hi> and it is the means
by which Christs power is put in execution.</p>
            <p>Now this power of the keyes giuen to the Church, hath two
parts: first, the ministerie of the word: secondly, spirituall iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.
The first, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 19. namely, the ministerie of the
word, is set downe and authorised by Christ: <hi>I will giue thee the
keyes of the kingdome of heauen,</hi> that is, the word of God: and
whose sinnes thou shalt bind by that word, they shall be bound
by the cords of their sinnes in heauen, &amp;c. This ministerie of the
word, is a key to open and shut, two wayes: first, by teaching &amp;
expounding the word of God, and doctrine of saluation: and
this is a key. <hi>Luk. 11. 52. You haue taken away the key of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi>
The key of knowledge is the doctrine of the word of
God. Secondly, the ministerie of the word is a key in men law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
called, in that they apply in the ministerie thereof, the
curses of the law to them which liue in sinnes, and the promises
of the Gospell to the repentant heart. So it openeth and shut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the kingdome of heauen: for that which the Minister pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth
by Gods word to be bound on earth, is fast bound
in heauen, &amp;c. Here we must remember, that Ministers are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
certaine or vncertaine of mens repentance: being certaine,
they must remit sinnes certainely and simply: but being vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
they must do it with condition, and so they must simply
or with condition, remit and retaine sinnes. Then in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
handling of the word, men must pronounce with conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
seeing they be vncertaine who are penitent, who not. Their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors
are a mixt companie, some beleeue, and some do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue:
<hi>Lydiaes</hi> heart is opened, <hi>Simon Magus</hi> is hardened. The
second power of the keyes, is spirituall iurisdiction: it is called
spirituall, to distinguish it from mens, and ciuill iurisdiction of
the Magistrate. It is set downe and confirmed by Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi>
18. 16, 17, 18. and after, the promise is added, vers. 19. 20. This
spirituall iurisdiction is a power, wherby the Church pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
sentence vpon an obstinate sinner, and putteth the same
sentence in execution. It hath two parts: Excommunication,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:14859:148"/>
and absolution. Excommunication is an action of the church, in
the name of Christ excluding an obstinate offender fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
priuiledges of the church and the kingdome of heauen.
That so much is in true excommunication, we see 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. the
incestuous person must be excluded from the church, and be
thrust out into the kingdome and regiment of Satan, and his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
some way afflicted. <hi>Math.</hi> 18. 17. if the offender will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
being excommunicate, he must be as a prophane man, euen
one which hath no title to the kingdome of heauen. But some
may say, Christ onely can thrust them out of the kingdome of
heauen. It is true indeed, so he doth properly, yet the church
pronounceth who be receiued and who refused, as that an obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
sinner is shut out of the church, and withall shut from the
kingdome of heauen, she can debarre him of the outward priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
of the church. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. the drunkard which liueth in
drunkennesse shall not come to heauen: vpon which ground the
church shuts him out: by her sentence, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the kingdom of
God &amp; Christ. <hi>Ob.</hi> If this be so, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the true child of God may be
shut out, seeing he may fall to such sins. <hi>Ans.</hi> He may in part, and
for a time, not wholly and for euer, because he may be ouertaken
often, but yet as a free citizen is known to be a free-man, though
he be in prison for a time, and so hath no vse of his freedome; so
the child of God, though in part, for a time he be shut out, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
no vse of the kingdome of heauen, yet wholly and for euer
he is not; but so soone as he begins to repent, he shal be receiued
againe.</p>
            <p>Excommunication being so weightie a matter,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> it must be vsed
with great aduice, and due preparation, as we would when we
cut off a leg or an arme: not rashly, for then we sin against the
third commaundement, seeing it is one of Gods speciall ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
which we abuse whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is executed for each smal offence.
This exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication hath one especial degree, as 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 22.
he which loueth not Christ, let him be <hi>anathema,</hi> that is, accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and wholly shut from the kingdome of heauen. And
this is onely pronounced vpon one which sinneth against the
holy Ghost, and then the church vpon sufficient ground may
pronounce it. But it is very hard to discerne this sin, being more
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:14859:148"/>
in the heart then any where else: for it is a set malice against the
person of Christ, and that vpon knowledge. Now contrary to
excommunication is absolution: when an offender, vpon his suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
repentance, is approoued to be a member of the church,
and of Christ: first Christ must receiue him; then the church,
vpon his repentance, pronounceth and declareth him to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued.</p>
            <p>Further, to know the power of the keyes, we must know foure
abuses, crept in the vse of the power of them: the first abuse was
in former ages, in that they gaue them onely to <hi>Peters</hi> person, &amp;
barred al other Pastors from them; wheras they belong to al Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
in their places as well as <hi>Peter. Ob. Mat.</hi> 16. 19. Christ saith,
<hi>I will giue to thee Peter. Ans.</hi> But before he spake to all the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples:
and <hi>Peter</hi> he being more bold, and indued with aptnes,
answered in steed of all: not that the rest did not answer, but to
auoid confusion he spake for them all, <hi>ergo</hi> Christ speakes to him
in stead of them al. Secondly <hi>(Iohn 20. 23.)</hi> he giues it to them al,
not to <hi>Peter</hi> alone. And Ministers haue that power conueyed
from the Apostles, by vertue of Christs promise, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. he will
be with them, not onely in their persons, but in them which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
to the end of the world: to them (I say) which should
preach and baptise as they did.</p>
            <p>The second abuse is, that the church of Rome hath turned
the power of the keyes into the supremacie of the church: for
they make it a supremacie ouer al Princes and churches, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they put vp and pul downe Kings, and make lawes to bind all
mens consciences. For it is a seruice, and no supremacy.</p>
            <p>The third abuse is, that they will haue onely the Clergie, and
not the Prince to deale in matters of religion: but we reade the
contrary in Gods word. <hi>Iosias 2. Chron.</hi> 35. 32. he intends to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
idolatrie, and to set vp the true worship of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
causeth the people of Beniamin and Iudah to stand to his
couenant, his subiects to obey his intent: and this is commended
in him. But they say, that Princes haue not the chiefest power to
gouerne, because Pastors haue the power of the keyes. <hi>Answ.</hi>
Spirituall power is giuen to the Pastors, to rule the church spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually;
yet Princes haue power to rule the church ciuilly, to cause
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:14859:149"/>
their subiects to embrace true religion, and to forsake idolatrie:
but then (say some) they should be vnder the Pastors. <hi>Answ.</hi> If
we consider the Pastors person and goods, they be vnder the
Princes: but as they beare the key of Christ and his word, the
King must honour them, for they stand in the stead of Christ:
but to make the Pastor aboue the Prince, is a ready way to get
all into his hand, and a great abuse in the church of God.</p>
            <p>The fourth abuse is, that the Romish church hath turned the
power of the keys into the hands of their Priests in the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
of penance, for euery Popish priest sits as iudge, and euery man
cometh to him, kneeleth to him, confesseth all his sinnes he
can remember against euery commandement: he inioyneth him
to bewaile them, and after some signes of repentance, he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueth
the fault, and that properly as God doth: yet after par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
he must vndergo some temporall punishment, for he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueth
the fault only, not the punishment. In which abuse note
these errors. First, there is confession of all sinnes, which hath
no warrant in the word: secondly, he giuing absolution properly
as God doth, robbeth Christ of his honor: for eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Pharises
confessed, that God alone forgiueth sinnes properly. Thirdly,
they absolue from the fault, but not the punishment, and this is
to enrich themselues, and to get whole countries, yea all mens
lands and liuings into their owne hands. Fourthly, they will
haue them make satisfaction to God, which is impossible, and
withall, maketh Christs satisfaction imperfect. Now by these
foure abuses it appeareth, that Christ vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is no true Christ:
but though the Pope giue the keyes of <hi>Peter,</hi> the crosse keyes in
his Armes, yet he hath not the true vse of them: nay, seeing he
maketh new doores, (as beside that of heauen and hel,) those of
Purgatorie and <hi>Lymbus Patrum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note> he must make new keyes to
open them, flat contrarie to the keyes of Christ. In that Christ
is said both to open and shut, we learne, that he openeth not to
all men and euery person, but shutteth heauen gates against
some: for <hi>Adam</hi> falling from Gods fauour by his sinne, shut out
himselfe and his posteritie, both out of the heauenly and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Paradise: so that our sinnes be now as a partition wall, and a
cloud to separate God and vs. And for this, euen for our sinnes,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:14859:149"/>
Christ shutteth some out of heauen. Then by this we see our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
case: for by our sinnes we be all shut out of heauen, and
vnder the power of Satan. Our sinnes haue bene as so many bars
to shut vp heauen gates, which is no small matter, yet the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
bewitcheth vs, and maketh vs thinke sinne is no sinne, great
sinnes be small; small, none: whereas the least sinne is sufficient
to shut vs out of heauen for euer.</p>
            <p>Againe,<note place="margin">Vse. 2.</note> seeing sinne shutteth vs out of heauen, we must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
for euery sinne: for we cannot come thither if we liue in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
one sinne, euery sinne is a barre and locke to shut vs from
Gods kingdome: and we must labour to haue these bolts taken
of, which is only by the passion of Christ, for that alone can take
them away. Thirdly, we see that Christ opened heauen to some,
as to <hi>Nathanael</hi> in the ministery of the word: and he hath now
opened heauen doores by his death, and traced the way by his
blood. Now the doore being open, we must labour to enter in,
yea thrust and croud to get in. That we may come thither, we
must become members first of his church on earth, else we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
come to heauen. That we may do this, first, we must come to
the doore, namely the church, before we come to the house,
namely heauen. Now the church is the doore, and in it is the key
to open heauen gates, namely the word of God. That thou maist
come into the church, first humble thy selfe for all thy sinnes, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
trust in Christ for the free pardon of all thy sins, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
in thy heart to liue a new life, and constantly in all things
to please God to the end, and then thou art in the church, and
hast the key to open heauen gates. But if thou come not to open
this doore in this life where the key is, thou canst neuer enter
into the kingdome of heauen in the life to come.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Verse. 8. I know thy workes.</hi> From this eighth verse to the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth,
is contained the matter of the Epistle, containing three
heads: first, praise: secondly, promise: thirdly, commandement.
The praise is in the eigth verse: the promise is two-fold, in the
ninth and tenth verses: the commaundement in the eleuenth.
1. The praise is propounded summarily, <hi>I know thy workes.</hi> Then
the reason why he praiseth her, where the former words be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="280" facs="tcp:14859:150"/>
               <hi>I know thy workes.</hi> This hath bin expounded in euery Epistle,
I know and approue thy course and conuersation of life. These
words are repeated in euery Epistle, to stir vp euery church and
member of the same, to the feare of God: for Christ by these
words would haue vs be perswaded, that God is present with
vs, seeth all we do, is an eye-witnesse of all our actions. Then we
should do all our actions as in his presence, as before his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie:
and where this consideration is not in some measure, there
is no feare of God, nor true religion. The reason of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
is added, <hi>Behold, &amp;c.</hi> here note two points, first a signe
of his approbation, <hi>I haue giuen thee an open doore, &amp;c.</hi> secondly,
what be the workes he approoued, <hi>Thou hast a litle strength.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Behold, &amp;c.</hi> These words may be vnderstood either of the
Angell of Philadelpha alone, or of the whole church, both Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor
and people. If of the Angell, this is the sense: Behold I haue
giuen thee, that is, behold and consider I haue giuen and vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed
thee libertie, and oportunity to preach my Gospel, and by
preaching to win and conuert sinners to me. So 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 9.
there <hi>Paul</hi> vseth the same words, signifying by the doore of vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance,
libertie and oportunitie to preach the Gospell of
Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For thou hast a litle strength:</hi> That is, though thou be endued
but with a small measure of gifts, yet thou hast maintained the
doctrine of saluation, and not denied my Gospel in persecution.
Now Christ saying thus to this Minister, that he had giuen him
libertie to preach; shewes it is a great priuiledge to preach the
Gospell, and to win soules to Christ: for so much the word <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,</hi>
and the words themselues import. That it is so, it appeareth
in that the most worthy Prophets haue not had this graunted, as
<hi>Esay, Ezechiel,</hi> &amp;c. they hardened the people, and they say they
spe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t their strength in vain, &amp; did no good. For this, ministers are
called the instruments of saluation, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. they shall shine, for
the winning of soules, as stars in heauen. Then they which haue
this priuiledge, should esteeme of it highly aboue any thing in
the world, for it is a most excellent dignitie, aboue all earthly
preferments, for which we ought especially to magnifie Gods
mercie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="281" facs="tcp:14859:150"/>
               <hi>For thou hast a litle strength.</hi> Though thou hast but small mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of grace and gifts,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> yet thou hast maintained my word. Here
we see that Ministers, though indued with small gifts, may do
much good to the Church, as this Angell of Philadelphia did:
and we haue seene by experience, when as in Queene <hi>Maries</hi>
time, in this place learning abounded, yet not one of them
would stand out for the Gospell: yet one not farre off, hauing
but small gifts in comparison of their schoole-learning, stood
out and sealed the profession of it with his bloud. And so now
men of smaller gifts further the Church and Gospell, more then
they which haue farre greater knowledge in the arts and tongs:
for such as haue greater gifts, be commonly flacke, so that they
which be behind them in gifts an hundred degrees, do more
good in the Church then they, by a thousand degrees. Yet for
all this, men must be brought vp in learning, and labor to know
Arts and Toungs, though we see it cometh to passe, that men
which want such schoole-learning, they haue zeale, and do
more good then they which excell in them: that so men of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
gifts might be humbled in the consideration of this point.
<hi>Naamans</hi> seruant perswadeth him, when <hi>Elisha</hi> the Prophet
cannot. 2. <hi>King.</hi> 5. 12.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Behold.</hi> These words may also be vnderstood of the whole
Church: <hi>I haue giuen thee a doore:</hi> that is, a speciall priuiledge to
enter into the kingdome of heauen, and title to it. I approue thy
workes: and this is a signe of it, that I haue giuen thee entrance
into the same. Now this is a priuiledge not belonging to all
men, but onely to the Church of God. Which confuteth vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall
redemption.<note place="margin">Vse.</note> If this then be a priuiledge of the Church,
to enter into the kingdome of heauen, and to haue such liberty,
we must labour to vse it, striuing to enter into that place. We
haue this priuiledge, to see heauen open by faith: we must not
then be so slacke to enter into it: but alas we make no account
of it, we are wholy possessed with the profits and pleasures of
this life: and our sinnes are such a loade to vs, that we cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in. Oh let vs cast off such burthens, that so we may more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
enter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Which no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shall shut.</hi> That is, no power, after I haue opened
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:14859:151"/>
heauen, shall be able to shut it. Here after the libertie, he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the continuance of it: namely, for euer. How then is it true,
that Christ died for all men effectually, if all men are not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
because they will not? So Christ should for his part o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
heauen, and they should shut it by their wils. But Christ
saith, no power either of the diuell or man can shut it, he hauing
once opened the same.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For thou hast a litle strength.</hi> Thou art indued with a litle and
small measure of grace, of faith, hope, &amp; regeneration: yet accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to that measure, thou hast defended my word, and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
me in persecution. By this we see, that a man indued with a
small measure of Gods spirit, may do works acceptable to God,
and by the same come to life euerlasting, if his grace be true
grace. <hi>Math.</hi> 17. if their faith be but as a graine of mustard seed,
it shall be able to remoue mountaines. Now that which is true
of miraculous faith, that is true of iustifying faith: if it be true,
though neuer so litle, yet it shall be able to do workes pleasing
to God, and by the same we may come to saluation: for God
regardeth not so much the measure of grace, as the maner,
that it be true, not fained. In this is a speciall comfort for those
which labour to keepe faith and a good conscience. Such are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
troubled with the consideration of their owne weaknesse
and wants: but they must know, that if they haue true faith,
though it be but in small measure, the Lord accepteth of them,
if they labour to please God in all things: for the Lord accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
a man, not for that he should haue, but for that he bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
on him, be it much or litle. This may incourage those which
be not so forward in religion, which haue not made such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
as they should: for many seeing the Lord to require so
much, they cast all off, and neuer labour to come to know reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and to keepe faith and a good conscience. But these shold
remember, that the Lord accepteth of small gifts if they be true;
he accepteth a man according to the measure of grace he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoweth
on him, be it more or lesse. Then we must not be discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
for our wants, imperfections, and ignorances: for if
we labour to haue true faith, the Lord regardeth not the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of grace, but that it be true grace. Yet we must take heed
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:14859:151"/>
we abuse not this mercie of God, and take occasion to sinne,
and to become negligent and carelesse in the duties of religion,
but still labour to come to such measure, as the Lord will most
approue of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Because, &amp;c.</hi> Here Christ sheweth for what workes he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth
this Church: first, <hi>she kept his word:</hi> secondly, <hi>she denyed
not his name,</hi> but maintained it in persecution against all his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.
And these two containe euen all the duties of a true
Christian, and the whole practise of all religion. And these must
be an example for vs: we must labour to keepe his word, and
in all things to do his will. Secondly, we must in time of perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
defend his name, and maintaine his word against all his
enemies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To keepe his word.</hi> A few wordes, but a great dutie: for it sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth,
that she in all things, in euery commaundement of the
law and Gospell, had care to obey his word and will. And hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
were we indeed, if Christ could say so of vs, that we obeyed
his word, all the commandements of the law by obeying, and
the Gospel by faith and repentance, &amp;c. But it cannot: for though
in shew we professe we do, yet in life we shew we faile in most
points of both.</p>
            <p>Vers. 9. 10. In these verses are two promises concerning the
conuersion of certaine Iewes. <hi>Behold, &amp;c.</hi> Here is the first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
concerning the the confirmation of the Church of Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia.
Now it is likely, in this citie there was a synagogue of
the Iewes, which bare men in hand, that they were the true
worshippers of God, yet denied Christ the Sauiour, and so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
this Church. Now Christ here promiseth he will make
this synagogue repent, and become true members of Christ, to
professe Christ, and worship him. In this promise note three
points: first, who is the author of their conuersion, namely, God:
for so it is said, <hi>I will make them,</hi> or I will bring them to that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,
to worship me. Secondly, who be conuerted, namely, <hi>the
synagogue of the Iewes.</hi> Thirdly, the fruites of their repentance:
<hi>they shall worship before thy feet.</hi> First, the author of their conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
is Christ himselfe: for so he saith, <hi>I will make them to repent.</hi>
These are significant words, which giue all to God in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:14859:152"/>
of some and of all sinners, God is the sole author, man
hath no stroke in his owne conuersion: man indeed willeth it,
and is conuerted willingly; yet not by nature doth he will it, but
by grace. This confutes the Papists, who hold that nature and
grace may concurre in the conuersion of a sinner: for a man (say
they) being stirred vp by grace, can will and do that which is
good. As a man being sicke, he hath the facultie of walking, yet
being faint he cannot, vnlesse he leane on anothers shoulder: so
a man hath a power to will that which is good, but it must be
stirred vp first by grace. But <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. man by nature is not onely
sicke, but starke dead in sin, and cannot moue one foote, no more
then a dead man. <hi>Obiect.</hi> But (say they) then man should be but
a blocke, if he doth nothing in his conuersion. <hi>Answ.</hi> Though he
do nothing in the matter of conuersion, yet he hath sense and
vnderstanding, which he can vse in naturall and ciuill causes,
though he cannot vse them in spirituall actions, and so he is not
like a stocke.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I wil giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> come:</hi> therfore a man being effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
called, he cannot either come, or not come at his pleasure, as
though God did for his part offer man grace, and will him to
come, yet he may refuse it, and not come: but if God call, man
cannot but come, else Christ would not haue said, <hi>I will giue him
and make him come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But they say, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. Christ saith to Ierusalem, <hi>How oft
would I, &amp;c. but you would not. Answ.</hi> He spake that not as he was
God, but as he was a Prophet, or the Minister of circumcision to
the Iewes. Againe, say they <hi>Act.</hi> 27. they resisted the holy Ghost.
<hi>Ans.</hi> That is the doctrine of the Apostles and Prophets, which
was indicted by the holy Ghost, not the spirit of God himselfe,
for no inferior power can resist a superior. To come to the next.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Who be conuerted.</hi> Namely, a certaine synagogue of the Iewes
at Philadelphia, which said they were worshippers of Christ, yet
indeed were the synagogue of Satan, and bond-slaues of the
diuell.</p>
            <p>Here we see not onely small,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> but great and old sinners may
repent and be saued. Christ he died for all kinds of sinners, great,
rebellious and obstinate: if they can repent, they may be conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:14859:152"/>
and come to Christ. 2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 26. they must waite for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
of those which were taken in the diuels snares, so as he
would wish them no surer. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. some were giuen ouer to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate
sense, yet it is likely that some of them repented. Then
we see, great, grieuous, and notorious sins may be forgiuen, yet
we must not abuse the grace of God to liue in sinne, but gather
comfort hence, that though we be great sinners, yet if we can
repent there is mercie with the Lord, no sin can hinder vs from
Christ. We reade that Christ healed three sorts of dead men,
some when they went to the graue, some buried, and some
which lay foure dayes and stanke, as <hi>Lazarus</hi> did. So Christ hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
all kind of persons, he calleth men of all sorts, euen them
which lie stinking in sinnes, and are almost rotten in them. Then
take the benefite of Christs exceeding mercie, when he calleth
thee to repent: come, and cast away thy sinne, though thou be a
vassal of Satan, a man rotten in sin, yet Christ hath mercy infinit,
he can heale and help thee: and he came to call, not those which
think they be righteous, but such as are penitent sinners, to take
them out of the Lions paw, and to saue the lost sheepe of Israel.
Then abuse not this exceeding mercie, but blesse his Maiestie for
it, and vse it as a meanes to repent, to bring thee to newnesse
of life, to breake off thy sin, and to make thee a liuely member in
Iesus Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I will make them come and worship.</hi> Now followeth the third
point in the conuersion of a sinner: namely the good fruites of
their repentance and conuersion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I will make them worship.</hi> These words are expounded 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.
25. where the children of God prophecying, there cometh
in an vnlearned man, he falleth downe and worshippeth: so
here he will cause these wicked Iewes to come, and fall downe,
and worship and adore the true God in the congregation of
Gods church and people. In these words note two fruites of
conuersion: the first concernes God: the second, the church of
God and the members of the same. For the first; to worship
God, it is a true fruite of a conuerted sinner, which no man can
truly performe as he ought till he be conuerted, to wit, to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
and adore God in the companie of his saints &amp; people. The
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:14859:153"/>
natural man knoweth that there is a God, that this God must be
worshipped: but to worship him as he ought, it is a worke that
none but he which is truly conuerted can performe. Another
may performe outward worship, heare the word, receiue the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments:
but true worship which is in the heart and spirit (for
God is a spirit) that he cannot performe. Now for the worship
of God, three properties are to be noted in these words: first,
<hi>They shall come and worship:</hi> not worship simply, but <hi>come,</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
that the true worship of God must be voluntary, willing,
and cheerefull, not of constraint or compulsion, but as though
there were no law or iudgment for them if they did not. <hi>Psa.</hi> 110.
they came freely, not by compulsion.</p>
            <p>Then we see how most men come short: for men are not tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
with loue of the word, neuer or seldome come to heare it,
onely come to morning or euening Prayer, because if they do
not, the law wil compell them. These are no true worshippers of
God, for he cannot abide any worshippers, but willing and
voluntary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And worship:</hi> That is, reuerence God with bowing the body
or knee: and this is the second property: we must expresse our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence
in conuenient and seemely bowing of the body or the
knee. Then we see, this is not a thing indifferent, but necessary, to
vse meete and conuenient gesture of the bodie in the seruice of
God, to bow downe, and prostrate our selues, our soule and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.
<hi>Esay.</hi> 6. the Angels in the presence of God couer their feete
with three wings, and their face with other three, testifying their
reuerence and adoration in the worship of God. So must Gods
people worship him in soule and bodie, &amp;c. But we come short
in this dutie: for whereas we should vse seemely and conuenient
gesture of the bodie, to shew our reuerence and humilitie, we
see many lie snorting and leaning on their elbowes, others vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reuerently
with their heads couered which ought to be bare, for
God is a God of soule and bodie, therefore we must reuerence
him with both.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Before thy feet.</hi> This is the third propertie: namely, in the
congregation of Gods people, they shall prostrate themselues
at their feet: in hearing the word or prayer, they must be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:14859:153"/>
the pride of their hearts beaten downe, be smitten with
feare of Gods Maiestie, and of their owne sinnes. <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 29.
The Iaylor ouer night put <hi>Paule</hi> into prison, but in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
finding all the prison doores open, and thinking all the
prisoners to be gone, he would haue killed himself. Now being
thus astonished and affraid, <hi>Paule</hi> preacheth the Gospell to
him, which before he contemned: but now being smitten with
feare of the Maiestie of God, he heareth <hi>Paule</hi> willingly with
trembling, and cometh kneeling and crowching to him, saying:
<hi>What shall I do? &amp;c.</hi> And vntill a man be smitten downe with
feare of Gods glorious Maiestie, with sense of his iudgements
for his sinnes, and so come to humble himselfe, he cannot be a
true beleeuer of Gods will and word. The cause why there be
so few true professors, and that all serue God with formall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
is, because they were neuer cast downe, they were neuer
smitten with feare of Gods Maiestie, neuer confounded for
their owne sinnes: for till these be in vs in some sort, we cannot
worship God, we cannot bow, and crowch, and humble our
selues before him. And this is the cause why most of the people
euery where content themselues with outward and formal wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
with mumbling ouer their Creed, Pater noster, and the
tenne Commandements; they were neuer smitten downe with
feare of Gods iudgements and their owne sinnes: their natural
pride was neuer beaten downe with their owne vnworthinesse.
Then if we would be true worshippers of God, let vs come wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly,
let vs worship God in soule and bodie, and let vs come
with humbled hearts, with mortified minds and affections, and
so we shall worship him aright.</p>
            <p>The second fruite of the conuersion concerneth man: <hi>Before
thy feete,</hi> meaning the church of Philadelphia: namely, that they
being conuerted to the church of God, should reuerence it, and
the members thereof. They shall cast themselues downe in the
congregation, as men not worthie to be me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of the church,
but as a footstoole for them to trample and tread on, by reason
of the great sinnes which these conuerted Iewes had before
committed. This their exceeding reuerence shewes it selfe in the
roote of the same, which is a base conceit and vile opinion of
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:14859:154"/>
themselues, and so should euery true conuert study to confesse,
namely, that he is the greatest sinner of all Gods children, and
thinke so basely of himselfe, that he can be content to be not a
member, but the footstoole of the congregation: and this must
we follow, if we be truly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerted; we must haue a base opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of
our selues, think we are the most vile of all Gods people, &amp; giue
place to all men in regard of our sins. <hi>Paul Tim.</hi> 2. calleth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
<hi>the chiefe of all sinners,</hi> and we must do the like: for the proud
Pharisaicall heart is farre from repentance, but the lowly and
humble heart is accepted of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And shalt know that I loue thee.</hi> Here is a reason of the former
words, for why did these persecuted Iewes become true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers
of God, and beleeue in him, and reuerence his church?
The reason is, because <hi>I wil make them perswaded that I loue them:</hi>
and this is the ground of all true reuerence. All superiours haue
reuerence due to them by Gods ordinance, as the father, master,
Magistrate, &amp;c. Now that they may haue true reuerence of their
inferiours, they must first labour to be beloued of the Lord, and
then they procure to themselues true reuerence: for the loue of
God to vs, is the ground of this. Then those which excel in birth
or riches, they must not looke to be reuerenced for them, but for
that they be loued of God. And whence cometh it that men in
authoritie, as the father, master, Magistrate, Prince, &amp;c. want their
due honor and reuerence, but because they seeke not the ground
of it, namely to be in the fauour of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Because thou hast kept the words of my patience.</hi> Here is the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
promise of Christ, namely, preseruation of this church in
time of most bloudie persecution. This Epistle and booke was
written by <hi>Iohn</hi> after Christs ascension in the daies of <hi>Diocletian.</hi>
Now after him came <hi>Traian,</hi> who raysed a most bloudy perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
against the church in al countries, putting to death many
of Gods children. Now of this persecution, Christ foretels this
church, and withall makes this promise, that he will preserue
them out of the Emperors hand, and addeth a reason, <hi>They were
constant to obey his Gospell.</hi> In the promise consider first the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
<hi>Because thou hast kept:</hi> secondly, the thing promised, <hi>Deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance:</hi>
thirdly, a prediction or prophecie of that which should
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:14859:154"/>
come on this Church.</p>
            <p>The occasion: <hi>Because thou hast kept the word of my patience.</hi>
Some vnderstand by word of patience, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
which she shold obey: but that is too narrow: but it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
the doctrine of saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> taught in Christ. And this doctrine
of saluation is called the word of patience: first, because the
doctrine of the Gospell teacheth vs patience: secondly, because
it is an instrument of patience, to worke it in vs: for when a man
beleeueth his saluation in Christ, then he is patient in all things.
Thirdly and especially, because the Gospell cannot be obeyed
constantly to the end, without patience. For a time one may
obey, but it is impossible to obey and be constant to the end,
without patience. The good ground bringeth foorth fruit,
but in patience. <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.</p>
            <p>This Church receiued the doctrine of the Gospell,<note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
beleeued it: for which is promised deliuerance in perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.
Then we see, that the grace of God well vsed, is rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with plentie and increase of grace: so that they which haue
but small measure of grace, yet if they be faithfull, the Lord will
reward it with greater increase. This should make vs take pains
to increase, and vse our talent of faith, patience, repentance, and
obedience, to the glorie of God, and good of men: and the Lord
will double and triple the same, otherwise he will take that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
from vs.</p>
            <p>The doctrine of the Gospell,<note place="margin">Vse. 2.</note> being a doctrine of patience,
how necessarie is it for vs to learne the same, seeing the calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and afflictions belonging to any calling are very many? We
must get our bread in the sweat of our browes, and no man is
free from sicknesse, sorrow, and death. Now if we would indure
these afflictions, we must haue this grace of patience, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
beleeue the doctrine of saluation by Christ, which will
make vs patient in any crosse whatsoeuer. Againe, we professe
the Gospell of Christ: now this is a doctrine not of disorder, but
of all order and moderation, teaching vs to moderate and hold
in our affections and will: whereas if we want it, we are caried
away at their pleasure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My patience.</hi> Christ calleth it his, because he is the author of
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:14859:155"/>
it, and worketh it in vs. And this is added to beate downe the
pride of this Church. For when Christ commended them for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
they might begin to be too proud. Therefore he
hauing commended her, lest she shold be so, he telleth her it is
not her owne, but his gift, he putteth it into her heart. And this
may beate downe the pride of our hearts, when we consider
that we haue nothing of our selues, but all good things in vs
come from Christ; he bestoweth them on vs, he giueth all, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
we haue of our selues, <hi>What hast thou that thou hast not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued?</hi>
why then should we be proud of it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I will deliuer thee.</hi> That is, from the great and bloudie persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Traian</hi> which lasted fourteene yeares, wherein many of
Gods children were put to death. Hence note, that God hath
set downe the very times and houres, in which he will trie the
faith of his children. <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. the Lord led <hi>Israel</hi> through the
wildernesse fortie yeares to trie them. Chap. 13. 3. he sendeth
false Prophets to trie his seruants, whether they will cleaue to
him or not. So the Lord hath set times to trie his for their sins,
and to see what grace is in their hearts. So he dealt with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
commanding him to kill his sonne, <hi>Gen. 22. 2. Chron.</hi> 32. 31.
he left <hi>Hezechiah</hi> to trie him. And so euery Christian hath his
set time when he must be tried, that so God may either discouer
his hypocrisie, or make knowne his faith. When one foundeth
a schoole, he setteth some to see how they profit; after seuen
yeares or some such space, he will looke to trie the scholers, that
he may see how they go on: and without this triall men will not
make so good progresse. So in Gods schoole, the Lord he co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
at his set time, to trie what profit men haue made, to trie
their hearts, or true obedience, to reward them according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p>If God will thus trie vs,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> then it is best to trie our selues, to
seeke what is in vs: for though thou maist bleare the eyes of the
world, yet thou canst not deceiue him, he will search thee, and
lay all open to the world. If thou be an hypocrite, he will detect
thee, and make thee knowne: if not, he will make knowne thy
grace. Then neuer dawbe vp the matter, spare not thy selfe, but
seriously enter into thine owne heart, and neuer run with <hi>Adam</hi>
               <pb n="291" facs="tcp:14859:155"/>
from God, for he will pull thee out, slippe off thy figge leaues,
and make thee manifest to all men. Now when we haue entred
into a narrow search, we must in a strait maner seeke to reforme
our liues to the rule of Gods word, that so the Lord when he
cometh to trie vs, may approue of vs: for it is said, <hi>He will come,</hi>
the time is set and cannot be changed. It is a wonder to see how
mens mouths be full of precisenesse, so that if men knew not the
world to be full of blindnesse, it might daunt many Christian
hearts. But seeing there must be a day of triall of all that is in vs,
the Lord will not take our hypocrisie, but he looketh for since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie:
then we must seeke as much as is possible, to conforme our
selues to Gods will: for when we haue done all we can, we come
farre short, and though men mocke vs, yet God will approue
vs. Then labour to be pure in all things without hypocrisie, not
giuen to any one sin: but in all things, word, deed, and thought,
keepe faith and a good conscience: be not like to the foolish
virgins; haue not blazing lampes without oyle. If a man come
to trie a scholer in a good schoole, and after long teaching find
him not to haue profited, it is a great disgrace: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what disgrace
is it for vs, if after so long time of grace Christ come to try vs, and
find no grace in vs, no faith, repentance nor obedience, but hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie,
and nothing answerable to our profession? But we must
with <hi>Dauid, Psal.</hi> 26. be so vpright, that for sinceritie of heart, we
would be content to haue the Lord to trie vs, being not giuen
to any sinne, nor tainted with any offence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I will saue them.</hi> But how can this be, seeing no Church was
free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this generall persecution of <hi>Traian:</hi> for the Churches of
Asia were all persecuted. Now this was one of the most famous
Churches: how then did Christ saue them, seeing they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
grieuously, and (it may be) put to death many of them?
<hi>Ans.</hi> Promises of deliuerance (as this is) be not simply made,
but with condition. <hi>I will deliuer thee:</hi> that is, saue thee from
temptation and persecution, so farre as it shall be hurtfull for
the saluation of thee. Christ promiseth freedome, not simply
from persecution, but from the hurt which might come thereby
to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in respect of Gods grace and their saluation. <hi>Ps.</hi> 91. He
which trusteth in the Lord, the plague shall not come nigh his
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:14859:156"/>
dwelling; yet we see in common plagues, as well the godly as
the wicked die: yet it is a true promise, that the plague shall not
come nigh him, to hurt him or his, to hinder any mans saluation.
And we pray: <hi>Lead vs not into temptation,</hi> not to be free from all
te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptations, but that we be not wholy left of God vnto the diuel:
but though we be tempted, that he will deliuer vs from the euill
of the temptation, that it may be for our profit and not our
hurt,<note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note> and so Christs promise is good to them. God will haue his
children tempted; yet here is their comfort, he will keepe them
that they shall not haue any hurt by the temptation, to hinder
his grace or their saluation. Though they be subiect to tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and suffer a thousand crosses, yea die in them, yet if they
keepe the faith, they shall take no hurt: but the Lord will turne
them to their good: so that this may comfort and reuiue any
perplexed and oppressed conscience in persecution and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
Againe, seeing this promise is onely conditionall, and
not simple, but as it freeth vs from the hurt of the temptation,
we see, they which pray for freedome from all temptations, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
and persecutions, haue no warrant out of Gods word,
if they put not in that caueat: for euery petition must haue a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
in the word:<note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> now there is no promise that a man shall be
free from all temptations, but onely from the hurt of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
&amp; afflictions. Then we must (when we pray for temporal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerances)
pray onely with condition, so farre as they shall not
hurt our saluation, and hinder Gods grace in vs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>From the houre of temptation.</hi> But how can this also be true?
that the long and bloudie persecution vnder <hi>Traian</hi> for four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene
yeares, should be called but <hi>an houre of temptation? Ans.</hi>
First, in regard of God, to whom a thousand yeares are but as
one day, therefore fourteene yeares is but a short time. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in regard of eternall punishment in hell which we deserue,
this time of persecution is but a short time. Thirdly, in regard
of the persecutions of Gods people: <hi>Iacob</hi> serued twice seuen
yeares for <hi>Leah,</hi> and they seemed a short time to him, by reason
of his affection to her: so the affections that Gods people haue
to the Lord, to his word and religion, make them thinke many
yeares persecution a short time. <hi>Paule</hi> for his affection and loue
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:14859:156"/>
to Christ, thought eternall damnation but a yeare, a short time.
So these in this Church thought this long and bloudy persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
a short time, an houre, for that loue they had to Christ and his
Gospell, and the glory of God; and for this affection could haue
bene content to suffer it longer. The end why Christ vseth this
phrase, is to comfort this and al other Churches in persecutions,
by the shortnes of their continuance, which is but <hi>an houre,</hi> a
short time. Now though they last twentie yeares, yet if we haue
any affection to Gods glory and to his religion, it will be but an
houre, a short time. This consideration of the shortnes of time,
might incourage any man, and arme him to endure any perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
crosse, or affliction. Besides this which I haue said, note
that in these words there is a prediction: there is a prediction
of a thing to come, namely, <hi>an houre of temptation.</hi> Here Christ
foretelleth a thing, not present, but to come, though not known
to the Church, and that without the helpe of any creature, man
or Angel: which prophecying of this persecution vnder <hi>Traian,</hi>
sheweth that he is true God: for it is a propertie and priuiledge
of God simply, of, by, and from himselfe, without helpe of any
creature, foreseeing of things in their courses, to foretell a
thing to come. Men cannot foretell any thing, vnlesse it be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
in the causes, not simply. Then here we must know the cause
why this persecution came to them rather then peace, and why
Christ foretold it rather than peace. The cause why Christ saith,
this houre of temptation shall come, is not any foreknowledge
of Christ, or because he foretelleth it: for things come to
passe, not because God foretelleth and knoweth them: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they be to come to passe, therefore he foreseeth them and
foreknoweth them.</p>
            <p>The cause then why things come to passe, is the will, good
pleasure, &amp; decree of God. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 23. Christ was put to death by
the eternall counsell and decree of God: so it was Gods will and
pleasure, not his foreknowledge, or foreseeing, that this persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
came on this church: and the decree of God in the effecting
of all things, is the highest cause by which all things come to
passe, and that giueth being to al other causes. <hi>Obiect.</hi> Then God
is the author of sin. <hi>Answ.</hi> As Gods will and decree in the effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:14859:157"/>
of things, is in the highest place: so must we distinguish of
the things he willeth; for he willeth some things which he effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth
himselfe, as all good things: some things he willeth, and
yet doth not effect them, but onely permits them to be done by
other: as sin and euill things, which though they come not from
his will, yet they be according to his will, not against his will; for
his will disposeth of sin and euill things; and in all things, good
or euill, his will disposeth and setteth downe the causes and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of place, time, maner, how, the end, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Then their opinion is false,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> which hold that certaine things
(as sin) come to passe, God onely foreseeing them, not decreeing
them to come to passe, or permitting them. Now to giue God a
bare foreseeing without decreeing, is to rob him of his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
and to take from him his prouidence, by which he dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
of all things, seeing euery thing which is done cometh to
passe by his will and decree, he either decreeing and effecting it,
as all good things, or permitting it, as euill things.</p>
            <p>The end why Christ alleageth this prophecie, is to expound
the former words, namely, why he called the time of persecution
<hi>a temptation,</hi> because it should certainly come to trie the whole
earth. Where we may note the propertie of any affliction, perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
or crosse, namely to trie a man, to discrie what is in his
heart, whether there be grace and feare of God, or hypocrisie.
And for this end is the crosse sent to men, to make knowne ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
their faith or hypocrisie. And there is nothing better to trie
the heart of man then temptation and afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and then though
thy heart was full of presumption before, thou maist know what
is in thee, and iudge of thy selfe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Verse 11. Behold, I come shortly.</hi> Here is Christs commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
in it note first the occasion it selfe: secondly, the reason to
inforce it. The commaundement, <hi>Hold fast,</hi> namely, with both
hands, as for life and death. If thou haue receiued a litle measure
of grace, rather part with any thing then with it, keepe it and
preserue it till death: but of this before.</p>
            <p>The reasons to inforce this commaundement, are two: one
before, the other after. The first, <hi>Behold, I come shortly.</hi> I wil come
to thee shortly, either by generall iudgement, or else by particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:14859:157"/>
iudgement by death. Now before it Christ puts a word of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
to shew that this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement is not to be lightly passed
ouer of vs, but to be earnestly and often remembred. Now see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Christ teacheth vs that he will come shortly to vs in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
general or particular, we must beleeue him, and often haue
it in memory, that Christ is not far off, but wil come to vs shortly
to shew our estate either in heauen or hell. Then we must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
it, haue it written in our hearts and in our memories, and
not flatter our selues: we must not say, that Christ will deferre his
coming: he teacheth vs that he is at the doore, he cometh short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
either by generall iudgement of all men, or particular iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to vs.<note place="margin">Hierome.</note> Then happy were we if we could (as that auncient fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did) thinke we heare his trumpet sound continually in our
cares, and thinke in our hearts, and remember this, that Christ
wil not be long, but will come very shortly. And indeed the
cause why men liue in sin, &amp; neuer call themselues to an account,
is, because men beleeue not, and haue not learned this lesson, that
Christ wil thus come shortly. If me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were thus perswaded in hart,
Christ will come to me shortly, to iudge me, giue me my reward
in heauen or hell, surely if they belonged to God, it would make
them turne to him from their sinnes, and breake off their wicked
life; nay though a man were most desperate, yet this wold make
him tremble, to thinke how Christ will come shortly to iudge
him: yea it wold make me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if they had any spark of grace, to labor
to get faith and a good conscience. Seeing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christ is to come
to iudge them shortly, who would not repent? who would not
leaue his sins and turne to Christ, vnlesse he will cast his soule a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way?
Then this is our duty to labour to get faith and a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
to iudge our selues, that we may preuent Christs iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Againe, this very consideration will make a man constant
in all Christian duties: and lastly it wil comfort such as be in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
for they may be sure their affliction shall not last alway,
for Christ will come to iudgement shortly, and he will free them
from all their crosses, and he will ere it be long giue them deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance.</p>
            <p>Now followeth the reason after the commaundement, <hi>That
no man take thy crowne from thee:</hi> that is, the crowne of glorie,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:14859:158"/>
word, to vse his Sacraments reuerently, else he will take them
from vs, put off our crowne, and make vs a barbarous and bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish
people, giuen to all idolatrie. O then let vs hold these fast
with both hands; let all go, honour, riches, preferment, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
and our owne life, ere we loose our glorious crowne of the
Gospell of Christ: for if we wil not hold it fast, he will giue it to
a nation, which though now we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temne, yet they shall scorn &amp;
hisse at vs. And now that we heare of warres and inuasions, let
these put vs in mind of greater iudgement, and assure vs that
if we make not more accompt of the word and Sacraments, and
not only professe outwardly in bodie, but in the seruice of God
ioyne heart and hand, be indeed as good professors as we beare
the world in hand we are, the Lord will remoue our crowne,
and giue it to a nation which will bring foorth better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,
and seeke to maintaine it better.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vers. 12. Him that ouercometh, will I make a pillar in the temple
of my God.</hi> Here is set downe the promise, which containeth two
things: first, to whom the promise is made, <hi>to him that ouerco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth:</hi>
secondly, the thing promised in the words following.
For the first, he giueth to vnderstand, that whosoeuer will haue
his seruice pleasing vnto God, must dispose himselfe to fight a
good fight, and to wage battell against all his enemies. A man
cannot be a good Christian, except he be a good souldier: when
he beginneth to turne to God, then he hath innumerable ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
both within himselfe, and without, to make him take ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
course, and turne from God: now if he be not a good soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,
these enemies will ouercome him.</p>
            <p>For the second, the thing promised is <hi>eternall life:</hi> in these
words: <hi>I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God.</hi> Christ here
alludeth to men in this world, who haue bene wont to build
pillars vpon hils and mountaines, that the posteritie to come
might remember them when they were dead and rotten. 1. <hi>Sa.
18. 18. Absolom</hi> in his life had reared him vp a pillar, which is
in the kings dale: for he said, I haue no sonne to keepe my name
in remembrance. This then is the sense: It is the custome of
men, to set vp pillars for the remembrance of their bodies: but
I will make the man himselfe that ouercometh, a pillar.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="298" facs="tcp:14859:159"/>
               <hi>In the temple.</hi> That is, in the Church triumphant, figured by
the temple at Ierusalem: as if he should say: Others set vp pillars
in fields and mountaines, but I will make him a pillar in the
temple of my God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I will make him a pillar.</hi> That is, I will not onely make him a
part, but a worthie part in the temple.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My God.</hi> This is set downe to shew, that God is Christs God,
as he is Mediator: otherwise as he is God the second person, he
is equall to the Father.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And he shall go no more out.</hi> First, he shall abide a pillar for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
he shall not need renewing as the pillars of men do. This
pillar shall haue three names: first, the name of God: whereby
he doth signifie, that he is the seruant of God. Secondly, <hi>the
name of the citie of my God.</hi> By citie is not meant the triumphant
Church, but the place thereof: namely, the high heauens. The
meaning of it is; I will make it manifest, that he is a citize<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the
place of glorie. This citie is described in the words following;
by a resemblance it is called new Ierusalem, because that was a
citie that resembled Paradise where <hi>Adam</hi> was, <hi>New Ierusalem.</hi>
But how can it be called new Ierusalem, seeing it was before
the earthly Ierusalem? <hi>Answ.</hi> It is called new, not in regard of
the being, but in regard of reuelation: for it was before the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Which came downe out of heauen from my God.</hi> It is not said, it
shall come downe, but it <hi>is come downe.</hi> This clause is added to
answer to an obiection, which he that ouercometh might
make, thus: Heauen is farre off, how can heauen come downe
from heauen? <hi>Ans.</hi> It cometh downe to vs by the preaching of
the Gospell: for by it we begin to be citizens thereof. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>The third name is <hi>my new name.</hi> By the name of Christ we are
to vnderstand glorie and power. <hi>Ob.</hi> But Christ had glorie and
power from all eternitie. <hi>Ans.</hi> True, he had so: but this is to
be meant as he is God incarnate. Now the ends and reasons
which made him describe the estate of life euerlasting, are these:
first, to comfort them which keep faith and a good conscience,
he doth describe the reward thereof, being an excellent meanes
to incourage men to go forward in the faith. Learne we then
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:14859:159"/>
in all our afflictions, to keepe this faith and good conscience
to the end, by beholding the estate of life euerlasting, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
thereof.<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 26.</note> 
               <hi>Moses</hi> desired to suffer afflictions, because he had
respect to the recompence of the reward. The second rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of this description, is, to bring men to view the excellencie
of life euerlasting. Many men are drawne from religion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they take such pleasure in earthly matters: which they
would not, if they thought eternall life so great a matter. The
third reason is, to teach men to practise <hi>Paules</hi> rule in the 1. to
<hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 12. to lay hold on eternall life. Men with both hands
lay hold on the world, both of honour and riches, none layeth
sure hold of life euerlasting, though it be neuer so sweet, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant,
blessed, and glorious. The fourth reason is: to make the
people of God not to feare the cruellest death that can be, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
bodily death is a doore to glory. Thus much generally of the
twelfth verse: now it followeth that I speake particularly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I will make him a pillar.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note> That which the seruants of God shall
be in the Church triumphant, that they must beginne to be
in the Church militant. If therefore thou wouldest be a pillar in
heauen, thou must begin to be one on earth, by vpholding and
maintaining the Gospell. Againe, in that he saith, <hi>I will make
him a pillar</hi> in Ierusalem, that is, the Church triumphant, they
must learne to amend their erronious opinion, who thinke eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Church as holy as Ierusalem, and is to haue the same reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And I will write vpon him.</hi> That is, he shall haue God for his
God. Here he giueth vs to vnderstand, that we can haue no fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship
with God but by Christ, God will neuer saue nor blesse
vs out of Christ his Sonne. If therefore thou wilt giue thankes
to God, thou must do it through Christ: if thou wilt receiue any
temporall blessing of God, it must be in and by, not out of
Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I will make him a citizen of the kingdome of heauen.</hi> Here we
must learne to carrie our selues in this world as citizens of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
and not of this world, otherwise we can neuer looke for
heauen. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 20.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I will make heauen come downe.</hi> Here we may see the mercie
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:14859:160"/>
of God to man: heauen was shut vp by our sinnes, but God hath
opened it by the bloud of Christ, that we might enter therein.
Therefore if we will haue the <hi>new name,</hi> we must become new
creatures: for neither circumcision nor vncircumcision auaileth
any thing, but a new creature: if we content our selues with the
old man, we shall neuer come to heauen.</p>
            <p>Vers. 13. Let him that hath an eare, heare what the spirit saith
to the Churches.</p>
            <p>This is the last part of the Epistle written to the Church of
Philadelphia. Now whereas Christ againe and againe repeateth
the same words, the Ministers of the Gospell haue a warrant if
they preach the same Sermon to the people, yea though they
preach it oftentimes. But they must looke that they do it not for
ease, but for the good of the Church. And therefore the hearers
hearing the Minister repeate the same doctrine, ought not cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
to reprehend him: for then they may as well reprehend
Christ himselfe, as before I haue shewed. Here then is a dutie
commaunded: namely, to heare: this hearing is the good lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
that bringeth true faith, saluation, and sincere obedience
with it. But to whom is this commandement giuen? To hearing
hearers, and to such as do not onely receiue the word of God
with their outward eares, but with the eare that is in the heart.
Hence we learne, first, that God doth not giue to all men grace
to heare his word to their saluation. Secondly, that we
must so heare, that thereby we may be conuerted and changed.
But what is to be said? namely, what the spirit teacheth to the
Churches. That we might heare attentiuely, he vseth a double
reason: one drawne from the speaker: another from the audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
to wit, the Churches. But I haue spoken of these before.</p>
            <p>And to the Angell of the Church of the Laodiceans write,<note place="margin">Vers. 14.</note> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>As before all the other Epistles, so before this last Epistle,
there is a commandement giuen to <hi>Iohn</hi> to write it. And the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle
hath three parts, as the former had: first, a Preface: second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the matter: thirdly, a conclusion. First, of the Preface, wherin
Christ is described (in whose name it was penned) by two ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</p>
            <p>First, by his name and title, <hi>Amen, a faithfull witnesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="301" facs="tcp:14859:160"/>
Secondly, by his priuiledge and propertie, <hi>the beginning of
the cratures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Amen,</hi> is an Aduerb of affirmation or asseueration, signifying
<hi>truly, verily,</hi> &amp; <hi>certainly.</hi> The reason why he is so called, is rendred
in the words that follow, which are a commentary and full ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of this, <hi>The faithfull witnesse, &amp;c.</hi> So that to this end he
is called <hi>Amen,</hi> to shew that he is a true and faithfull witnesse.
See chap. 1. 5. there I expound it. And here I will repeate the
heads onely of that exposition.</p>
            <p>He is called <hi>a witnesse,</hi> betweene God the father and vs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
he doth not onely reueale the fathers will to vs, but sealed
it with his blood, and giueth vs many testimonies inward and
outward: but of all testimonies, that of the Scripture is most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.
And for these three respects he is thus termed: first, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he doth reueale it, and seale it, and ratifie it, by inward
and outward testimonies: secondly, because he wold accomplish
his fathers wil. 2. <hi>Cor. 1. 20. All the promises of God are in him, yea
and Amen:</hi> that is, most certaine, and therefore he is a witnesse,
yea a faithfull witnesse. Thirdly, he is called a true witnesse,
because he speaketh the truth: that which he reuealeth from
his father, is the will of his father, who is truth it selfe: he saith as
the thing is, without error or falshood, nay his will is the rule of
all truth. This is the meaning of the first argument.</p>
            <p>Now the vse and the end why here Christ is so called, if we
do but reade the Epistle and marke the contents, we may guesse
probably at the end: which is, that he might shew himselfe an
example to the Angell of that Church, who was slacke and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligent
in his ministery, therfore Christ instructs him how to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
himself without respect of persons, teaching the word of God
truly and faithfully. See chap. 1. 5. And not only to the Angel, but
to all the Church, yea to all Christians, he propounds himselfe
an example of two worthy vertues, faith and truth: he would
haue all to be true and faithfull in their life and conuersation, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
as he is. This faith is a vertue, whereby a mans word beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
as sure as an obligation, as we vse to speake, whereby we
make good all our words, othes and promises.</p>
            <p>Truth is that whereby a man without lying, deceit, or fraud
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:14859:161"/>
speaketh the truth from his heart, that (I say) which is necessary
to be knowne for his owne and others good, and for the glory
of God.</p>
            <p>Set we this example before our eyes, and as Christ is a true and
faithfull witnesse, so let vs be carefull to shew our selues true in
all our words and speeches, and to be faithfull in all our promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
These be excellent graces in Christ, and fruites of the spirit
in Christians, therefore let vs be knowne by these to be like
Christ. The second end of this title, is to induce this Church to
apply it selfe to the word of God effectually; for it was faultie
in this point: therfore that he might bring them to this, he saith
that he is a faithfull witnesse.</p>
            <p>How should they do this? Thus: consider in the word the law
and the Gospell, the commaundements, promises and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
and apply them particularly euery man to himselfe: the
commandements to know sinne, the threatnings to humble vs,
and that we may be touched in conscience, and made fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
Gods grace: see an example of it, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. in the prodigall
son: <hi>I haue sinned, and am not worthy, &amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Ezra</hi> hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
themselues. No man can truly be humbled till he make
this particular application of the word which he readeth and
heareth.</p>
            <p>Now the Gospell also must be thus applied: we are bound to
beleeue the promises of life eternal, not onely that they are true,
but to apply them to our selues. The Gospell requireth a further
thing, which is the foundation of the church: for proofe see <hi>Phil.</hi>
3. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. The summe is this, he esteemes all things losse in
regard of Christ, and desires the righteousnes which is by faith
in Christ, and to know the vertue of Christs resurrection. Now
marke the fifteenth verse: let so many as be perfect be thus min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
teaching euery one of vs our dutie, to apply Christ to our
owne person. Thus are we bound in conscience to apply the
Gospell to our selues: and whosoeuer doth not so, he makes God
a lier, as much as in him lieth. 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. And this is the principall
end and reason why Christ calleth himselfe so, that men might
not onely beleeue the word in general, but apply it in particular
to themselues. The not doing of this, is the cause of negligence
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:14859:161"/>
in religon, of so many luke-warme Christians and professors.
Therefore let vs all learne this dutie. It is not enough to know
the word, no nor to be able to teach it, but aboue al things to lay
it to the conscience, to apply it, that we may be truly humbled
and turne to God: therefore iustifying faith is that which appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in particular.</p>
            <p>Now the second title of Christ, is <hi>the beginning of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
Col.</hi> 1. 16. By him all things were created in heauen and
earth: therefore in regard of creation he is so called. Yet I doubt
not but there is a further cause why he is so called here, namely,
because he is the beginning of the new creatures: as <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 10.
where it is said, we are Gods workmanship, created in Christ to
good workes. Marke there euery Christian is a workmanship of
God. To this purpose <hi>Esay</hi> 53. 10. saith, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christ shal giue him
selfe a free will offering, he shall see his seed. How? Thus: All that
are borne a new, they are the seed of Christ, he is the beginning
and roote, and so much the very scope of this Epistle declareth.
Now he is such a beginning two waies, first as he is the author of
regeneration, for whosoeuer is borne a new, Christ is the cause
and author of his conuersion. Therefore <hi>Esay</hi> 9. 6. he is called
the father of eternitie, because he doth regenerate men to life
by his spirit, and <hi>Esay</hi> 8. 18. he saith, <hi>Loe here I am, and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
that thou hast giuen me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, as he is the matter thereof, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. the Church is
flesh and bone of Christ, where the Apostle alludeth to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our first parents: for <hi>Adam</hi> was a figure of a man regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate:
and as <hi>Eue</hi> had her beginning from <hi>Adams</hi> side, so the
Church and euery Christian haue their being and beginning
from Christ: from his blood springs the Church of God and
all Christians, as they are new creatures and regenerate, not as
they are men and women.</p>
            <p>Now the end why he is so called, is to meete with a vice in
that and other Churches. Men haue more care and desire to
seeme to be Christians, then to be Christians indeed: men set
more by a shew, then truth; shadow, then substance. Therfore he
shewes that their principall care must be to be true Christians
indeed, &amp; not to seeme so only. This church was not regenerate
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:14859:162"/>
in that church, and therefore Christ tels them of it, that he is the
beginning of new creatures. And the same is our fault, our care
is not so much for the power of godlines, as for the shew of it:
therefore I beseech you haue care of this: to heare the word and
to receiue the sacraments are good things in their kind, but they
are not sufficient to saluation: except thou become a true mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Christ, thou hast no good by them.</p>
            <p>2 He saith this to meete with another vice, that is, spiritual
pride. He shewes that there is no excellencie in outward things,
all earthly excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cies are nothing without this, wherby a man is
a new creature: therefore we must not stand vpon our pantofles
for our birth or gentry: but whosoeuer wil reioyce, must reioyce
in this, that he hath Christ for the author of his regeneration.</p>
            <p>Further, this teacheth vs an excellent lesson, that Christ loueth
and preserueth his church, for as it was in the first <hi>Adam,</hi> so it is
in the second <hi>Adam.</hi> The woman had not her beginning apart
from man, but of and from him, that he might loue her the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and haue care of her preseruation. So this is to teach vs, that
Christ hath a care of vs, and that we must honor him. Nay, which
is more, <hi>Adam</hi> was but the matter onely, and not the author of
<hi>Heuah,</hi> but Christ is both to the church, to shew his loue to be
endlesse. The root neuer hurts the branches, nay it strengtheneth
it selfe to defend, cherish, and maintaine the branches: it hath no
affection, inclination or disposition to hurt, but to helpe. Thus
much of these words, to note the bond betweene Christ and his
church, yea his loue and our dutie.</p>
            <p>Hence I gather, that the Papists erre, in teaching that a man
hath the vse of his owne will in his regeneration, and that he can
dispose himselfe in his iustification: for a creature cannot worke
nor help to create himself: but euery regenerate person is a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of God, and the conuersion of a sinner is here made the
creation of a man: the creature in his owne creation is able to
do nothing. If there were no more such sayings in the Bible, this
one were sufficient to confute that opinion. And thus much of
the preface. Now the matter of the Epistle or contents and
substance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Verse 15. I know thy workes, &amp;c. that thou art neither hote nor
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:14859:162"/>
hote, &amp;c.</hi> The Proposition hath two parts. First, a dispraise, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe.
Secondly, counsell. The dispraise is for two faults: the
first, lukewarmnesse: the second, pride and vanitie of mind. Then
first, I will make the words plaine: secondly, declare the vse
of them. <hi>I know:</hi> that is, all thy waies and workes be manifest to
me, and I vtterly dislike them. And to lay open their fault the
more, he borroweth a comparison from water, whereof there
be these three sorts, hote, cold, and warme.</p>
            <p>Cold and hote water may be receiued into the stomack with
lesse hurt and annoyance: but the water that is lukewarme trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth
the stomacke, and ceasseth not till it be cast vp againe.</p>
            <p>Now with these three kinds of water, he compareth three
sorts of men. By cold men, vnderstand the enemies of religion,
as Iewes and Gentiles, Turkes and Saracens, Gadarens and
Galileans.</p>
            <p>By hote, vnderstand men zealous in religion: by lukewarm,
indifferent. So the meaning is, thou art neither an open enemy
of religion, nor yet truly religious, or a true friend.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I would, &amp;c.</hi> Christ here maketh a wish: but he doth not sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
wish, that they were enemies of religion: but in respect of
their estate, he wisheth they were either of those, rather then
as they were. Otherwise this absurditie would follow, that
Christ should wish them to be of a people no people of God. By
lukewarmenesse, he vnderstandeth a people professing the word
of God, and yet not greatly regarding and reuerencing it. This
people is a lukewarme people: as if he should say, a mixture of
both, neither hote nor cold, wanting the heate of grace, and the
fire of Gods spirit, whereby their hearts should be heated and
inflamed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vers. 16. Because thou art neither, &amp;c.</hi> The meaning is this.
Euen as a man that hath receiued such water, will cast it vp,
and cannot keepe it in: so Christ being grieued with their sinnes
will cast them off from hauing any fellowship with him, and
make them to be no Church. This is the true and right mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the words. Now in them these things are contained.</p>
            <p>First, Christ setteth downe their fault, and aggrauateth it.
Secondly, he compareth three kinds of men together.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="306" facs="tcp:14859:163"/>
The hote man hath the best place, and the cold man the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
and the lukewarme man the last and lowest. So you see
the enemie of religion and of Gods grace, is better then he that
professeth religion, and liueth not thereafter. As if he should say,
the ordinarie Gospeller which contenteth himselfe to heare the
word, and to receiue the Sacraments, is not so good before
God, as the Turke and Iew. The threatning followeth: <hi>I will
spue them out of my mouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now hauing found the meaning, we must examine our selues
whether we may not be charged with the same fault: and it will
be found that we are guiltie of this, and euen plaine Laodice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.
Which that you may see, I will shew diuerse kinds of such
lukewarme Gospellers and Christians.</p>
            <p>1 The Papist though he seeme to make a great shew of loue to
Christ, yet he performeth no such thing: for he parteth stakes
with Christ, and maketh himselfe to be his owne sauiour: so
that howsoeuer he pretend to be a most zealous Catholike, yet
he hath no true grace.</p>
            <p>2 The Temporizer, he which altereth his religion as times
alter. And such is the bodie of our people, and they are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed
to confesse it, that they will follow the Prince, and
change their religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the time. And this sheweth what men
will do, if Poperie come againe: they may say they are good
Christians, but they shew themselues plaine Laodiceans.</p>
            <p>3 All such as follow <hi>Nicodemus:</hi> that is, which loue Christ,
but dare not come to him by day light: such as thinke they may
heare Masse, and yet keepe their conscience to themselues, hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
betwixt God and <hi>Baal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4 Such as are mediators and pacificators, and would make
an vnion betweene vs and the Papists, being perswaded that
our religion and the Papists are all one in effect, for the matter
and substance of it: and that all the difference is only in circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
so they write and defend their opinion: but let them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
what they will, zeale of Gods glorie, or whatsoeuer, be it
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> neuer so much, they are but Laodiceans. A fift fort there is,
and who are they? <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. Such as serue God and Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.
And where are they? nay, where are they not? Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:14859:163"/>
is out time, wherein men will needes be professors, and yet
how is all their time spent vpon care for this world?. The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
part of their life and time is bestowed on that; there is all
their ioy, care, desire, labour and studie: let them say what they
will, so long as their care and studie is spent vpon Mammon,
they are very Laodiceans. And such are the most part of our
hearers, they draw neare God with their lippes, but their hearts
are vpon their goods; the whole heart is set vpon the world,
and the whole time of their liues is spent in this. Who they are,
your owne consciences will tell you, they are indeed Christians
&amp; professors, but lukewarme, and worse then Christs enemies.</p>
            <p>6 They that heare the word and like it, but in their liues
giue themselues to sinnes, blasphemie, drunkennesse, fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
oppression, vsurie, some to this vice, some to that. And e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
in this very ranck I place those which professe religion, but
yet delight in the fond and irreligious fashions of the world, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the new, strange and monstrous fashions of apparell:
they spend so much time vpon their bodies, that the soule go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
naked. The world aboundeth with such now, yong and old.
It is strange to see how absurd men are, beyond all common rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
in apparelling themselues so fondly, whereas their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
shold put them in mind of their owne shame and naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
&amp; be no cause of glorying in them. And the modest gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
should shew the vertues of the mind: now what do they
else but shew the vanities and vices of our minds?</p>
            <p>Now,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> shall we excuse our selues, though we be none of these,
not intangled with the sinnes of the world? No, we cannot. We
shall find wants, of the feare of God, of hatred of sinne, of the
reuerend regard and estimation of the Gospel, which we ought
to haue: so as no man can say, he is free from this: nay, euery man
euen he that hath best grace, shall feele in himselfe want of
care and loue to God and his word. Therefore we must with
<hi>Iob</hi> lay our hands vpon our mouthes, and say, we are vile.</p>
            <p>Well, this being so, now consider the iudgement threatened,
lay it before your eyes, marke the end and recompence: Christ
will <hi>spue such out of his mouth,</hi> that is, cast them from God, from
Christ and his Church. This threatning pertaineth to this age,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:14859:164"/>
and therefore we must tremble, and be ashamed, and repent of
this sinne, left ere long we be spued out of his mouth. Thus much
of the examination of this sinne.</p>
            <p>Now of the amendement of it. Where note, first, the fault:
secondly, the greatnesse of it: thirdly, the punishment: that is, a
separation from the Church. Now I will proceed further to
shew, that euen among vs, as well as in other places, this sinne
is to be found, that euery one may be the better acquainted
with his owne state. And this appeareth by diuerse signes.</p>
            <p>First, by common neglect of the duties of Religion, which is
manifested diuerse waies: first, though we come often and gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
to the Church, yet very few profit in knowledge, and fewer
in amendement of life: and many that profit in knowledge
something, do thriue in obedience litle or nothing at all. How
true this is, I appeale to euery mans conscience. This is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident
argument of great negligence in all sorts. Take the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of our congregations, &amp; they be as ignorant as any. I know
there be some which profit both in knowledge and practise: but
I speake of the greatest part. Experience in diuerse occasions
maketh this manifest.</p>
            <p>The second token of this negligence, is, that few spend any
time in reading of the word, to search the Scriptures, &amp; try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be as they are taught or not: nay, few will be at the cost
to buy a Bible; or if they haue one, they will not take the paines
to reade in it, or to keep a constant course in reading of it daily.</p>
            <p>A third signe, is the prophanation of the Sabbath: though
many come to Church at the time appointed for publike wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
and seruice, yet there is no priuate sanctification of it at
home: but when the congregation is dissolued, men betake
themselues to their owne affaires, profits, delights and pleasures.
No such persons can possibly haue any great measure of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
or obedience and grace, because they do not keepe times
for this purpose. By these signes it is plaine and euident, yea
palpable, that there is great negligence in the duties of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
Now where there is such negligence, though coldnesse
be wanting, yet there is no heate, and we are but lukewarme
Gospellers. Another sign of lukewarmnesse, is this: our religion
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:14859:164"/>
stands on generals, and reacheth not to our particular callings.
In the church we are good Christians, but when we come home
to the particular duties of our priuate callings, where is religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
then? where is the practise of that we heare? There is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
made of lying, deceiuing, &amp; oppressing; &amp; no care of that
good dealing which ought to be in men. Al our religion is in the
church, and none at home. Whereas if religion were in the hart,
it would shew some fruit in our liues: as fire and heate cannot be
hidden. Although I doubt not but there be some of whom these
sins take no hold, yet there be many which professe that they be
neither hot nor cold, but in a meane between both, and yet they
will be partakers of the word and sacraments: and when they see
any haue care to obey, they haue presently the name of precise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
ready for them, because they haue care to do that which they
professe. In this very reproch they shew, that they are luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warme,
their mouthes proclaime it, and their liues professe it,
and they are neuer a whit ashamed of it. Whosoeuer opens his
mouth to fasten this reproch vpon his neighbor, he fastens vpon
himselfe this marke of luke-warmnesse without shame. And so
they go beyond the Laodiceans which were ashamed of it, and
would not defend it, whereas these boast of it. My meaning is,
not to fasten this vpon euery man, but I say it is a common sin,
more then any other.</p>
            <p>Well now,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> it being manifest, that this is the common sinne of
our time, yea our common sin, a sin that taketh hold of all sorts:
mark what followeth, they are in a worse case then the heathen
and Infidels are. The common Christian is worse in some case
then they, for Christ preferreth them before these. A man may
perswade himselfe that he is in a good estate for all that: but you
see Christs iudgement &amp; sentence: O, it had bin better for them
neuer to haue knowne the truth at all. They are in a worse case
which know Gods will and obey it not, then they that neuer
knew it. Let vs not deceiue our selues then: if we be but drowsie
Protestants, we are worse then Turkes. We boast of our estate,
and we despise the Infidels, but except thou ioyne with know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
purpose of obedience, thou art more vile and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
then they: Publicans and harlots shall come into heauen
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:14859:165"/>
before thee: it is not the external profession of religion that will
make the better then they, but grace in the heart and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
And this is the first point.</p>
            <p>The second point is, that we are in danger to be <hi>spued out of
Christs mouth:</hi> for this was written for our instruction, and for
all Churches: that as luke-warme water troubleth mens sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mackes,
so do we trouble Christ, and therefore are like to be cast
out euen as that is. We may flatter our selues, and thinke all is
well, as they did in <hi>Noahs</hi> time: but know it, we are in danger of
a most grieuous iudgement, namely, to be cut off from Christ,
&amp; to be made no people. Though we had no more sins but this,
we are in danger to be cut off for it. And God can do this diuers
wayes, either by taking his Gospell from vs, or sending in our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
among vs. And, by example of other countries, the Lord
sets this before our eyes dayly, how he can and will do this: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let vs not stand vpon any outward priuiledge, but lay this
to our hearts. And so much for the first sin. The second vice fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
in the seuenteenth verse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Verse. 17. Thou saist I am rich, &amp;c.</hi> Here is a new reproofe of a
new fault, and that is spiritual pride. These words depend on the
former, as a reason and cause: for before they were charged with
luke-warmenesse. Now the cause of that is pride: this is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that is the daughter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou saist.</hi> That is, thou thinkest thus. It is the maner of the
holy Ghost to expresse the thoughts of men by speeches; and
when men thinke thus and thus, the holy Ghost saith, they say
thus and thus: because, as manifest as our speeches be to one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
so manifest be our thoughts to Christ.</p>
            <p>In that Christ doth thus expresse mens thoughts,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> we may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that this booke is canonicall: for men cannot set downe in
writing what be their owne thoughts, much lesse other mens.
And so in all the bookes of Scripture the thoughts and imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of men are set downe, euen as they conceiue them: the like
cannot be shewed in any writings of men. It remaineth therfore
that we receiue this booke as the word of God. For, could the
Apostle <hi>Iohn</hi> by any art or learning come to know their
thoughts? No.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="311" facs="tcp:14859:165" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Now I come the thought. He expresseth their pride by the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of it, that is, their thought: and what is their thought?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I am rich.</hi> That is, I abound with spirituall graces, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
iudgement, vnderstanding and memory. By this thought
Christ describeth their pride, not outward, but inward; not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
but spiritual, whereby they perswaded themselues, that they
were in much better case and state then they were. And this is
the common sin of churches. Against this sin of pride, learne we
that Christ came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
But what, is there any righteous since <hi>Adams</hi> fal? No: but
some thinke themselues righteous, as did the proud Pharises,
which said as the Church of <hi>Laodicea</hi> here, <hi>I am rich.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi>
brings in the Corinthians, saying, <hi>We shall raigne.</hi> Thus you see
that this hath bin a common sin, and so it is at this time.</p>
            <p>In the popish Churches this opinion takes place, when they
perswade themselues to satisfie Gods iustice for temporall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
by their workes, and that they can merite sufficiently
for themselues and others.</p>
            <p>And amongst vs this wretched thought finds harbour.
We thinke we abound with knowledge, none will seeme to
be ignorant or to want knowledge, and therefore not one of a
hundred will aske a question: nay, many therefore will not heare
the word, because they know as much for substance as the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
can tell them; for all a mans dutie (say they) is but to feare
God and keepe his commaundements; and thou shalt loue God
aboue all, and thy neighbour as thy selfe: and what would you
more?</p>
            <p>Thus they perswade themselues, that they are rich, and want
no knowledge, when they know not one principle of religion
more then the law of nature teacheth them, namely, <hi>Do as you
would be done to.</hi> Others pleade that they haue had euer since
they could remember such a strong faith, that they neuer doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of Gods mercy. But this is no strong faith, but a strong pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption,
and a strange faith: for true faith is alway ioyned with
doubting and distrusting. Others professe, that they are rich
in loue, and they will not be drawne from it, but they loue God
and their neighbours, when they haue neither knowledge, faith,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:14859:166"/>
nor loue. Which appeareth thus: let a man make relation of any
bodily calamitie, and you are astonished, but let the Ministers tel
you that you are in danger of spirituall iudgement, and who is
afraid? where is the person that trembleth? Worldly newes trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth
you, but the word neuer scares you, the remembrance of
your owne damnable estate grieueth you not. Let vs say what we
will of your soules state, alas you regard it not, but the drunkard
will continue in his drunkennesse, and the adulterer and blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer
in their wickednesse,<note place="margin">Deut. 29. 19.</note> and euery man blesseth himselfe in
his sins, and saith God loues him, and he loues God, I am rich in
regard of Gods fauour, of spirituall blessings, &amp;c. This being our
sin, it stands vs all in hand to labour to see it, and to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Increased in wealth,</hi> or made rich. This is added only for am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plification,
to shew the measure of their pride, that it was
not small, but great: therefore the word is doubled to shew the
strength of their conceipt, and the greatnesse of their pride.
Now what is the cause why they were not onely puft vp, but
giuen to such an high degree of pride? <hi>Answ.</hi> Knowledge was
the cause, for no doubt but the Angell of that Church had great
knowledge, and was a learned man, and the people were well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed.
Now knowledge puffeth vp, it maketh mens hearts to
swell with pride; therfore it is true, that where much knowledge
is, there is much pride, if men want the grace of humiliation, and
griefe for sinne.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And haue need of nothing.</hi> Here is a further marke and token of
their pride: when a man thinkes thus, that he needs no help for
his saluation, if he stands in no need of Christs blood for the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
of his soule, this is a notable signe of abundant pride in
the heart. This serueth further, to conuince our congregration
of this pride, for if we be neuer so litle sicke, straight we seeke to
the Phisitians; but though our soules be neuer so sicke, none
seeke to the Ministers: sicknesses we feele, but not sins, therefore
the Phisitian is in request, but the Minister is not thought of till
the pangs of death be felt. This shewes that we abound in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
pride: therfore marke this, you must labour to feele what
need you haue of Christ; for til you do so, there is no grace in the
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:14859:166"/>
heart. If you would haue grace, learne this, that you want the
bloud of Christ: and till you feele this, neuer thinke your case
good, but wretched and damnable. It is a daungerous case for
a man to say, he wanteth nothing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And knowest not.</hi> Here he setteth downe the cause of their
pride: that is, ignorance: as if he should say, Thou knowest not
thine owne naturall estate, as thou wert borne of <hi>Adam,</hi> thy
state out of Christ. Thus we see, that ignorance is the cause of
pride, and pride of lukewarmenesse. By this he sheweth what
they are ignorant of.</p>
            <p>Hence it may be gathered, that <hi>pride was not the first sinne,</hi>
nor the roote of all other sinnes, as the Papists and some other
thinke. Indeed it is a great sinne, and a mother sinne, yet it hath
a more inward cause: that is, ignorance. Whereof? euen of a
mans owne estate before God: so much Christ here signifieth.
The cause why any thinke wel of themselues, and swell in pride,
is the ignorance of their owne estate: and because they are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of that, therefore they are puft vp with pride. By this we
must all be admonished, to haue care to learne to know our
owne estate, in which we are by nature, without Christ. Euery
person that will come to saluation must be throughly acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with his owne estate, and know his owne sinnes, and the
curse due to them: and therefore it is that the Prophets so often
call vpon the people to search and fanne themselues, that they
might be acquainted with their owne estate. Till you know this,
you shall be but proud peacocks, &amp; neuer haue grace: although
you haue otherwise very great gifts, of knowledge, and grace to
conceiue a prayer, &amp; be able to teach, yet you shall neuer haue
any grace to turne and repent truly, till the ignorance of your
state be remoued: and then cometh grace, true obedience, and
humiliation, and other graces needfull for Gods seruice: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
labour for it. If there be any blemish in your face, you will
see it, O then labour to see the spots of your soules.</p>
            <p>Now in that Christ doth thus strike at the roote of their
pride, and bewray their ignorance, he sheweth the state of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man by nature: so that here cometh to be handled the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
estate and miserie of man.</p>

The miserie of this Church is propounded two waies: first,
generally: secondly, particularly. Generally, in two words,
<hi>wretched</hi> and <hi>miserable.</hi> Wretched, that is, one subiect to misery,
griefe, and calamities: so much is signified by the first word.
That we may know what this miserie is, I will enter into a des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription
of mans wretchednesse. Where two things must be
considered: first, the roote and fountaine of it, namely, originall
sinne: which hath two branches: first, that very particular <hi>offence</hi>
and trespasse whereby <hi>Adam</hi> sinned, which is not onely the
sinne of his person, but of mans nature, and of euery one that
cometh of <hi>Adam,</hi> Christ excepted. Secondly, from that sinne, as
a part of it, and yet withall as a punishment of it, followeth the
<hi>corruption</hi> of mans heart, and defacing of Gods image, whereby
the heart hath got a pronenesse, and disposition, or inclination
to all sinne. In these two stand mans miserie: for from these do
spring al our miseries, both in and after this life. So much for the
first part, what mans miserie is. Againe, we must conceiue it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the forme of a punishment. All miserie of what kind soeuer,
is a punishment laid vpon man for that first sinne. Now the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
of sinne must be considered diuerse waies, according
to the diuerse times of mans being, either in this world, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
hence. All punishment is either in this life, or in the end
of it, or after: and so is miserie, in this life, in the end of it, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it. Againe, some miseries concerne the whole man, and they
are two principally. First, a subiection to Gods wrath, whereby
a man is in daunger thereof euery day, &amp; made a child of wrath.
This is a miserie of all miseries, and so much the more grieuous,
as a man cannot without some grace see it. Secondly, bondage
to the diuell: the Scripture speaketh of it oftentimes. You may
conceiue it thus: The man regenerate saith, I sin, but I would
not sinne: the naturall man saith, I sinne, and I will sinne; it is
my nature to sinne, and my pleasure, and in sinne will I liue. And
these are the two miseries concerning the whole man. Now
there be miseries which concerne not the whole man, but the
bodie or soule, goods or calling in this life.</p>
            <p>Miseries concerning the soule are these. First, in the mind
and vnderstanding, there is blindnesse and ignorance of Gods
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:14859:167"/>
will. Secondly, in diuerse persons, madnesse and foolishnesse.
All these are miseries, curses, and punishments inflicted on mans
soule for sin. And further, that nothing can be learned without
paines and difficultie. Further, in the mind there is a conscience,
and there is accusation, secret feares and terrors; and so many
accusations, so many miseries. In the will there is rebellion, and
in the affections, peruersenesse; which is not onely a sinne, but
a plague and punishment.</p>
            <p>And as the soule, so the bodie is subiect to his miseries, to
many paines, aches, and diseases. Yea, the diseases of mans bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
are so many, that all Physicke bookes cannot record them.
Besides diseases, there is mortalitie: that is, a subiection to death;
so as all the art and skill in the world cannot preuent it.</p>
            <p>In our goods, the want of necessaries is a miserie, and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of sinne a punishment, and in it owne nature a curse. And
all the hurt that cometh by the creatures, (whereas they be at
enmitie betweene themselues, or with men) it is a curse for mans
sinne. And in that they be subiect to vanitie too, all is for the
punishment of our sinnes. Further, all losses, and damages, and
crosses whatsoeuer, and wants of temporall blessings, they are
miseries. The like we may say of all callings: for there is none
but it is subiect to griefes and vexations; no man can carie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
so in any calling, but he shall feele some woe and miserie.</p>
            <p>And as in this life, so in the end of this life, the miserie is bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
death: that is, a separation of the soule from the bodie;
which, if man had not fallen, should haue remained vnsepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
This in it owne nature is a fearefull curse: for it is the very
gate of hell. And after this life, followeth the full accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Gods wrath: all the miseries in this life, are but prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
to that. Then cometh destruction endlesse in the place
of the damned. For this destruction, is first, a separation from
God, and excludeth men from all societie with him: secondly,
an apprehension of Gods wrath in the whole man, bodie and
soule for euer. Thirdly, it is in the place of the damned, with the
diuell and his angels: therefore this miserie is the summe and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment
of all miseries, the rest are but beginnings of
this. Thus you see what mans miserie is.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="316" facs="tcp:14859:168"/>
Now then considering what is the fountaine of our miserie,
originall sin; &amp; what is the nature of miserie, namely, it is a curse
and punishment; we see what it is to be wretched and misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
<hi>Thou art wretched.</hi> That is, tainted with sinne, and subiect
to punishment for it, in this life, in the end of it, and after it.</p>
            <p>Now touching this generall point, we are to consider the
end why Christ saith this: <hi>And knowest not, &amp;c.</hi> Which is, that he
might teach them and vs, to learne to know our miserie, and to
feele it, and to be touched in conscience for it.</p>
            <p>Whosoeuer shall but lightly reade ouer this Epistle shall see,
that this is the very end of it: for they thought themselues to be
highly in Gods fauour, when it was nothing so indeed. I pray
you all therefore which are now assembled here, to heare things
touching eternall life, and the saluation of your soules, forsake
&amp; abandon other conceipts, and turne your eyes to this, that
you may see what be the miseries to which you are subiect: and
when you see them, go further labour that your hearts may be
touched, that you may euen crie out with the men of Ierusalem,
<hi>What shall we do?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 2. 39.</note> Till then we shall be like these Laodiceans,
neither hote nor cold. We shall neuer haue true and sound reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
in vs, till we feele the waight of our miserie. I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that the sight of our miserie is Gods grace: but go to the
root, and seeke that all pride may be expulsed, and you may em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
the Gospell, which ministreth a remedie for all miserie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But thou art miserable.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> This word <hi>miserable</hi> signifieth one that
is worthy to be pitied: which he vseth to expresse the greatnesse
of their misery; meaning that they were so far subiect to misery,
that they were to be pitied of all men: so that this is not added to
shew any new thing, but to inlarge the former. Learne we
hence, that it is not our dutie to disdaine a sinner that is in mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
or to reproch &amp; scorn, but to pitie him: the more grieuous sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
a man is, the more he is to be pitied. It was <hi>Dauids</hi> maner
so to do, 1. <hi>Sam:</hi> 16. and he was so farre from contemning a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
that he shed riuers of teares, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 136. And <hi>Ezec.</hi> 9. the
good man was moued with the bowels of compassion, when
the people were sinfull.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 5.</note> The like is in <hi>Ier.</hi> 9. It was the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
fault, when the incestuous man had sinned, they were neuer
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:14859:168"/>
a whit humbled or moued with pitie, but puft vp with pride and
contempt, so that they scorned him, and <hi>Paul</hi> reprooueth it in
them.</p>
            <p>And this is a fault in many of vs, that men are not humbled
when they see other men sinne, our hearts are not touched with
sorow for it, but rather puft vp. If we haue receiued more grace
then other, let vs not despise or scorne them which haue not the
like measure. Thus much of their misery in generall. As for the
particulars, they are in number three: that he might strike their
hearts with a sense of their misery, he is not content to set it
downe in generall termes, but enters into particular, names
three maine miseries of theirs.<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> The first word signifieth one so
poore, that he hath not a rag to his backe, nor a bit of bread to
put in his mouth, more then he gets by begging. But here he
meaneth spiritual pouertie, which what it is, we shall best vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
when we know what is true riches, to wit, the grace and
fauour of God in Christ, for the pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of sins, to life euerlasting.
So the poore man is he that wants this, that hath no good thing
acceptable to God, who in regard of his soule, is as a begger
which hath nothing for the maintenance of this temporall life.
Thus you haue the meaning of this first word.</p>
            <p>Now the end likewise is to be considered why Christ calleth
them poore: namely, that they and we might striue to see our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie,
that we might become poore in spirit: for they thought
themselues rich, therefore Christ (to beate downe this conceit,
and to prepare them to true grace) tels them they are poore, in
regard of grace and life eternall.</p>
            <p>And here we are taught a principall point of religion,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>to feele our owne pouertie,</hi> that we haue no goodnesse in vs, and
therefore to despaire vtterly of our saluation in regard of our
selues. This is greatly commended in the Scriptures, therefore
learne another dutie. As we are by nature poore, and haue no
goodnesse in our selues: so labour to see it, and to be out of heart
with our selues, that is to be poore in spirit: otherwise you may
come to church, heare the word, receiue the sacraments, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
haue saluation, or haue spirituall blessings except you be first
acquainted with your poore estate, that you are very beggers,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:14859:169" rendition="simple:additions"/>
nay more, plaine bankerupts: for so Christ taught vs to pray,
<hi>Forgiue vs our debts:</hi> therfore Christ tels the proud Church of her
pouertie. Happie and blessed were our state and condition if we
could learne this, and lay aside our pride: for we are so poore,
that we must pleade nothing but pardon, no merit or satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
If we did this, then would we esteeme aright of the Gospell,
and haue some comfort by it. Now because we haue not this, we
do not embrace the Gospel heartily and chearfully as we ought.
Cary therefore away this lesson with you, that the beginning of
all grace is to feele the want of grace, to acknowledge your po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie,
and to be touched for it, and grieued euen from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
of your hearts, &amp; to feele this as sensibly, as the begger fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
his misery. Deceiue not your selues, Gods word must stand:
till you be beggers, the Gospell wil be but a dreame and a fancie
to you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> But how can Christ call her poore, seeing it was a very
rich people? <hi>Ans.</hi> It is true indeed, they were very rich, so histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
do record: but as it was a rich citie, so it was a poore church;
for all the wealth in the world is pouertie, without the fauour of
God in Christ: we are complete in Christ, without him we haue
nothing. All things are yours, and you Christs, and Christ Gods.
All temporall blessings are nothing out of Christ: riches are no
riches, honours no honors out of Christ. In Christ we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete,
and therefore rich Laodicea is but a poore and beggerly
people; and so are all without Christ.</p>
            <p>Therefore if God haue giuen you riches, lay vp a good foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation;
vse then for this end, that they may further and not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
your saluation, as helpes and meanes thereof, otherwise they
will be your ruine and destruction. So much for the first part of
mans pouertie.</p>
            <p>The second part is <hi>Blindnesse.</hi> How can they be said to be
blind? they had no doubt an excellent teacher, indued with great
knowledge and ability to teach; and I doubt not but the people
were well instructed. <hi>Answ.</hi> It cannot be denied but they had
great knowledge, yet they are called blind: first, because they
knew not their own estate; for though a man had al the skil and
knowledge in the world, he were but a blind man without this
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:14859:169"/>
knowledge. Secondly, because they knew not God in Christ.
They knew God in general, as many do now, but not by a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
application to themselues, that God was their God in
Christ, and Christ their redeemer. They were content to know
the Gospell generally &amp; confusedly. Thirdly, because they could
not vnderstand things that differred. It is a great gift of God
to be able to discerne things that differ, earthly things from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly,
and temporall from spirituall. Therefore let vs learne this
lesson: All knowledge is but ignorance, if a man know not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
and God to be his God, and Christ his sauiour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Let a man
be brought vp in the best schooles of learning, and haue the
most absolute gifts that can be, though he go beyond all men in
diuine and humane knowledge and learning: if he know not
himselfe, and his state before God, he knoweth nothing. Christ
sets this marke vpon the Angel of this Church, and yet no doubt
he was a learned man: but it shewes he had no care to know him
self. Therfore content not your selues to haue the knowledge of
the Gospell or humane learning, but learne to know that God
is thy God, and Christ thy redeemer, and that his blood was
shed for thy sins. <hi>Dauid</hi> intitleth the 32. Psal. <hi>his learning:</hi> and
yet what great or deepe learning is there, but this that he is blest
which hath the pardon of his sins: which he proueth by his own
example. And indeed this seasoneth al learning; when you know
Christ: till you do this, you are blind as these were.</p>
            <p>The last point of mans misery, is <hi>Nakednes,</hi> which is two-fold:
first, to the eyes of man: secondly, to the eyes of God. Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
and bodily nakednesse, is two-fold: first, before the
fall, and that was an excellent kind of nakednesse, whereby their
bodies being vncouered, were full of glorie, without shame: but
that is not meant here. Secondly, since the fall, sinful and shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
nakednesse, where the bodie is ful of deformitie, and all parts
of it should be couered, but that for necessities sake the face and
hands are left bare. Besides this corporall nakednesse, there is a
spirituall nakednes, which God seeth and man cannot see, that is
when a man lieth open and naked before God:<note place="margin">Exod. 32. 25.</note> as <hi>Moses</hi> saw the
people naked, not that their bodies were vncouered, but their
soules rather. Their sin appeared to God, and they in their sins,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:14859:170"/>
and so they lay subiect to Gods iudgements. This is spiritual na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes,
a plague of all plagues, and a miserie of all miseries,
when God beholds men in their sins.</p>
            <p>Now in that Christ saith,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> this Church was <hi>wretched and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,</hi>
and a part of her miserie was her <hi>spirituall nakednesse:</hi> we
learne diuers instructions: first, not to couer our sins before Gods
eies, for we stand al naked and vncouered before him. The studie
and care of most men, is to hide their sins from the world, but
few care for couering them that God may not see them. Looke
as ye haue seene Lazer-men lay open their nakednes before you,
so God seeth your nakednes. Let al carelesse and negligent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
remember this: whosoeuer considereth this seriouslie, they
will be ashamed to neglect this dutie.</p>
            <p>Further, let vs consider the end why Christ saith they were
naked. It is that al men might haue care to set themselues before
God, and bring themselues into his presence (and not seeke to
hide themselues from God as <hi>Adam</hi> did) that they may obtaine
a couering. We must al learne to know our owne nakednes, and
be perswaded that God seeth al our sins. Then we must be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
and touched for them: then we must pray for a couering. It
was <hi>Dauids</hi> practise,<note place="margin">Psal. 32. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Blessed is the man whose sins are couered.</hi> First
he vnfolds his nakednes, and then intreateth the Lord to couer
his sin, giuing vs to vnderstand, that he had laid open his naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.
So also should we all do, shew the wounds and scars of our
soules, that God may giue vs a garment to couer vs. That we
may all be partakers of the couering of Christs righteousnes, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to feele your pouertie and nakednes; for till you feele your
owne miserie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you are neuer fit for Christ.</p>
            <p>Further, Christ saith this, to prepare them and vs for the good
counsel following: therefore let this be the conclusion. If you
haue receiued any grace, labour to increase in it: if not, labour to
haue it: learne to know your owne pouerty, blindnes, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes,
and to feele it and be touched for it: be humbled seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
and throughly. This must be the needle to draw Gods
grace through your hearts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vers. 18. I counsell thee, &amp;c.</hi> Now followeth the counsell of
Christ, in the three next verses: in which he propoundeth a most
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:14859:170"/>
excellent and sufficient remedie of their miserie, in which note
three things: first, the maner of prescribing the remedie, by way
of counsell: secondly, the remedie it selfe, <hi>gold, apparell,</hi> and <hi>eye
salue:</hi> thirdly, the means to obtain it, <hi>buy of me.</hi> Of these in order.
The maner of prescribing is mild: in it Christ taketh vpon him
the person of a Counsellor to his Church: for as God hath his
Church and people, so in mercie he giueth them counsell and
counsellers. The president of this councell is Christ. <hi>Prou.</hi> 8. 14.
Counsell is mine, saith Wisedome. <hi>Isay</hi> 9. 6. Christ is called that
Counseller. He is both King of and Counsellor to his Church.
And surely this title of right belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth to him: for first, by his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
he aduiseth men how they shall escape eternall death, and
be saued: secondly, he teacheth how a man may please God in
all his actions: thirdly, how he may flie sinne. These three he
doth daily in his church and children, and that not by extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie,
but euen by ordinarie meanes; as by his word and spirit,
and therefore may well be called our Counseller: neither can
any, either Angell or man, thus counsell vs, but onely Christ.</p>
            <p>Now in that Christ is such a person by office and profession,<note place="margin">Vse.</note>
therefore we must acknowledge him to be our Counsellor: yea,
the Counseller of the Catholike Church, and euery part therof.
Therefore we learne to do him all the honour we can. Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors
of the common law are feed, reuerenced, and honoured
for their counsell, though it be but for worldly matters, and it
oftentimes faileth. Much more is Christ to be honoured, whose
counsell concerneth the things of God, and cannot faile, but
shall stand. Nay, as his counsell is infinitely more excellent then
the counsell of any other creature, so much more is he to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured.</p>
            <p>Further, in all dangers and temptations one must resort to
Christ for counsell: for to this end is he a Counseller. He told
them they were miserable, and therefore gaue them counsell,
declaring that he is at hand in all our miseries and distresse. And
therefore we must resort to Christ for his counsell, and rest vpon
it, and order our selues according to it. The good king <hi>Iehosa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat</hi>
(when the Moabites and Ammonites banded together)
was in great distresse, but what did he? <hi>We</hi> (said he) <hi>know not,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:14859:171"/>
Lord, what to do, but our eyes are toward thee.</hi> That is, we looke to
thee for counsel and direction: we must rest &amp; rely vpon thee for
wholesome counsel &amp; good direction. So should all men do in
distresse and daunger, as we are now, by reason of our sinnes and
the professed malice of our enemies: for by all likelihood these
dayes are the time of our chastisement and correction; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we must say as he said. Therefore in all distresse, whether it
be sicknesse or pang of death, forsake all ill counsell, go not to
wizards and Astrologians for helpe: but humble your selues,
and pray for his counsell. So much for the first part, that is, the
maner of prescribing this remedie.</p>
            <p>Now of the remedie it selfe. As the miserie had three parts,
and those great miseries all: so Christ propoundeth his remedie
in such sort, that it is answerable to the three branches of the
miserie: first, <hi>gold, that thou mayest be rich:</hi> secondly, <hi>rayment:</hi>
thirdly, <hi>eye salue.</hi> By <hi>gold,</hi> (according to the analogie of the
Scripture) we are to vnderstand the graces of Gods spirit, as
<hi>true faith, repentance, feare</hi> and <hi>loue</hi> of God &amp; man. All these are
called <hi>gold:</hi> as the triall of our faith is said to be more precious
then gold. We may likewise vnderstand al other gifts of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:
yea, all Christs merits, &amp; Christ himself the fountaine of all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Purged by the fire.</hi> That is, precious and fine gold, of speciall
account, that is purged from all drosse by the art of man. This
sheweth, what is the propertie of his gifts and graces, they are
as precious as fine pure gold: as 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5. This is worth the
marking, that the gifts of Gods spirit are of great price and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue,
and that before Gold. <hi>Psal. 119. 72. Math.</hi> 13. 4. This
teacheth all, how to beautifie themselues in soule and bodie.
The blind and false opinion of the world is, that strange attire
and forreine fashions beautifie and adorne the bodie: and it is
commonly thought that Iewels and precious stones adorne vs:
and indeed it is true in some persons, such as be great persona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges:
but strange fashions and outlandish attire disgraceth the
bodie. The right way to beautifie the bodie indeed, and to
make it truly glorious, and to adorne the soule also, i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to get
these graces: for these are as precious as fine gold. Our bodies
shold be the temples of the holy Ghost, &amp; the houses of a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:14859:171"/>
guest: therefore we should the rather labour for the best
ornaments. And if you will adorne your selues as you ought, you
must do it with the graces of Gods spirit, and abhorre these fond
and absurd fashions, which no wise man can like of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That thou maist be rich, &amp;c.</hi> These graces haue a further effect,
and serue not onely to adorne and beautifie, but also to make
men rich. Here then see the common folly, nay, madnesse of
men, which spend all their time, wit, and strength to enrich
their bodies, and leaue their soules vnfurnished. What a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
is this, that so many should neglect true riches, and studie
for nothing more then that which is nothing lesse then riches,
euen counterfeit riches? By this text it is more then manifest,
that such are more then mad, and that this folly is very great.
Therefore seeing true riches be the graces of Gods spirit, seeke
for these. So much for the first part of the remedie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>White garments.</hi> That is, Christ himselfe and his righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
imputed. As <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 27. euen as a garment is put on the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
so is Christ and his righteousnesse, and the fruite thereof,
that is, sanctification: all this is meant by garments here. Now
the end is to couer the nakednesse of the soule, which is defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
and defiled with sinne.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eye salue.</hi> That is, the spirit of illumination, knowledge
wrought in the mind by the spirit of God. For as eye-salue
doth cleare the eye sight, and sharpen the same, where it was
by some occasion hindred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so doth Christ by illumination make
a man know and vnderstand God in Christ, and discerne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
good and euill, of things temporall and eternall. Thus
you haue the meaning of these words.</p>
            <p>Now by the exposition you may see, that by all these we can
vnderstand nothing but Christ himselfe and his merits. One and
the same thing is signified by three words, to shew, that there is
in Christ the fulnesse of grace, and that he hath remedies for all
our wants. The Laodiceans were poore in spirituall goods, and
Christ was their riches; naked, and he their garment; blind, and
he their eye-salue. So that looke how many sinnes there be in
men, so many contrarie remedies there be in Christ. What
wants soeuer be in vs, he hath a supply of them all. The Papists
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:14859:172"/>
make him an insufficient Sauiour, in that they patch our merits
to his, and so they disgrace Christ: but we are to count Christ a
most perfect and absolute Mediator and Redeemer in himselfe
without vs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To buy.</hi> The meanes how these worthie gifts of God are got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.
Christ saith, by <hi>buying</hi> and bargaining: he saith not, receiue,
but <hi>buy.</hi> This is an allusion to the state of that citie which was
rich, and consisted most of Merchants, which liued by buying
and trafficke: therefore he speaketh to them in their owne kind:
as if he should say: You are a people exercised in buying and
selling, and are delighted with nothing more: therefore come,
I haue wares for you of sundrie sorts, gold, garments, and eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salue,
buy of me. Then the word <hi>buy</hi> must not be vnderstood
properly: for so we can buy nothing of Christ, but all is giuen vs.
This is said onely by way of resemblance, and I will shew wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it standeth. The principal things in bargaining are these: first,
a man that is to buy seeth his want, &amp; desireth to haue it suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
secondly, he cometh to the place where it may be had, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
for it, looketh on it, and liketh it: thirdly, he maketh the
price and value of it, he cheapeneth it: fourthly, he giueth mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
for it, or moneys worth, and so buyeth it: fiftly, if it be a
great summe he giueth earnest in hand. So by a certaine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
and resemblance, there is a kind of bargaining between
vs and Christ. For a man must feele himselfe to stand in need of
Christ and of his merits, and so see his owne want and miserie.
For, because men see want of bread, meate, drinke, and cloth
in their houses, therefore they go to buy of the baker, brewer,
butcher, and draper, &amp;c. Well then, looke how sensibly a man
feeleth the want of these things, so euidently should we feele
our want of Christ and his merits. And as the feeling of our
want is the beginning and occasion of our going to buy, so it
should be in this our merchandise. Againe, we should hunger
and long after Christ. As a buyer taketh liking of, and longing
for that he wanteth, and is thereby stirred vp to buy; so besides
the sense of our want, we should hunger and thirst after Christ.
Besides, we must prize Christ at so high a rate, that we count
all things else as drosse and doung; as <hi>Paule</hi> counted most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:14859:172"/>
things no better: we must value him aboue ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
worlds. Lastly, we must make an exchange. How? seeing
we can giue him nothing but his owne: therefore he saith, <hi>Come
buy without money. Simon Magus</hi> would haue bought him for
money, and was deceiued. Yet there must be an exchange, we
must giue him all our sinnes, and receiue his righteousnesse. See
here a most blessed exchange: for our shame and confusion, we
haue Christs righteousnesse and his merits. How? Thus: when
we begin to humble our selues, and pray for remission and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation,
then this change is made.</p>
            <p>Though we can giue him no earnest, yet he giueth vs earnest.
What is that? It is some portion of Gods spirit, some small mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of his grace: that is our earnest, that we shall haue the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of heauen. And thus heauen is bought and sold betweene
Christ and vs.</p>
            <p>When the heart mourneth for sin, and praieth for pardon, and
purposeth to sin no more, this is the worke of Gods spirit in vs,
and the earnest of our eternall saluation in heauen. Be our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
neuer so few or small, it is a sufficient earnest, as a penie is for
a bargaine of a hundred pound.</p>
            <p>Seeing all these things concurre to the receiuing of Christ,
therefore he calleth it <hi>bargaining.</hi> So this point is plaine, how
this spirituall bargaine is made, and why it pleaseth Christ to
terme it so.</p>
            <p>Now we see that we are commaunded this dutie:<note place="margin">Vse.</note> but how
stands the case with vs? Surely though many come to Church,
few make that bargaine which is mentioned: we are like passen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
by sea, which see many goodly buildings, fruitfull lands,
soiles, and sumptuous cities, but they make no purchase of them:
so we come and heare the word, but where is the partie that
makes this bargaine with Christ?</p>
            <p>Come to particulars. I appeale to all your consciences: who
almost feeleth or seeth his owne want and miserie? Men can
soone see the want of necessaries in their houses, but this they
cannot see. And as for the desire of Christ, and longing for him,
there is none. When you are drie or hungrie, you can say you are
drie and hungrie: but who saith, I thirst for Christ? If we looke to
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:14859:173"/>
our estimation of Christ, we are plaine Gadarens, and of <hi>Esawes</hi>
mind, we set more by a messe of red pottage, and esteeme the
basest things aboue Christ and his merits: nay, we are loth to part
with our sins, and to take his righteousnesse; we will rather keep
them stil then change for the better. Who taketh Christs righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
and declareth it by fruites? We can be content to loade
Christ with our sins, but we wil not be loden with his righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.
Is this a good change? No, it is not. Euery man can say; he
must rise betimes which shall go beyond him in base and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bargaines: but who hath regard of this excellent and heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bargaine? Then to conclude, I pray you al make this bargaine
with Christ, and do it presently, let it be your first worke. You are
carefull to put your children to good trades, and you do wel; but
be as carefull that they may make this bargaine, and you shall do
much better. This is the cheapest and the best bargaine that euer
was made, it will make you and yours rich for euer: as for other
bargaines, many cannot get them, and many loose them when
they haue gotten them; this onely is durable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Verse 19. As many as I loue, &amp;c.</hi> We haue heard a sharp re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe,
and as sharp a threatning; by which, because they might
take occasion to doubt and despaire of Gods mercie and fauour
in Christ Iesus, therefore now he takes away all occasion in the
19. and 20. verses. First thus, If I vse to rebuke and chasten all
that I loue, then you need not doubt of my mercie, albeit I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke
and threaten you so. This, I take it, is the proper occasion of
these words.</p>
            <p>Now see the meaning: <hi>I loue.</hi> Christ loueth the creatures two
wayes: first, as a Creator: secondly, as a redeemer. As he is a Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator,
he loueth them with a generall and common loue, whether
the creatures be reasonable or vnreasonable. As Redeemer, he
loueth them with a speciall and peculiar loue, not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to all,
but to that part of mankind onely which is elected and chosen
to saluation. And of this last loue he speaketh here: as if he
should say, <hi>As many as I loue,</hi> communicating with them my
righteousnes and life eternall: <hi>I rebuke.</hi> The word hath a larger
extent and signification, first to conuince one of a fault, and then
to checke or reproue the person: and it cannot well be rendred
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:14859:173"/>
in one English word. <hi>And chastice:</hi> that is, with such a kind of
correction which a father vseth to his child, which is called <hi>nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
to breake a child of his fault, and to teach him obedience:
and so it is vsed <hi>Prouer.</hi> 3. 12. whence this text is borrowed. The
meaning then briefly is this: All those persons whom I loue, I
conuince of their particular faults, and rebuke them: and like a
louing father, I chastise them and nurture them, to breake them
of their vices, and bring them to amendment.</p>
            <p>Now for the vse of these words:<note place="margin">Vse.</note> Christ sets downe his ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
dealing with his seruants, which is, by reproofe and chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and diuers visitations: for this very end, that he might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince
them and correct them. Euery member of Christ must
come vnder his rod, therefore looke for it: yea marke further,
Christ layeth vpon all his seruants afflictions in diuers sorts, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the diuers dispositions of mens natures: such as will
hardly be broken of their faults, he laieth vpon them more sharp
punishments: where men are easier to be amended, there he vseth
milder correction.</p>
            <p>The vse of this is two-fold: <hi>Prouerb.</hi> 3. 12. the first is, despise
not the Lords chastiseme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, for it is a token of his loue: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>soeuer
he reprooueth or afflicteth thee by visitations and crosses, make
not light account, but make profit of it. The second is, <hi>faint not,</hi>
arme thy self with patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, because it is the Lords maner to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stise
those that he loueth: and so many chastisements, so many
pledges and pawnes of his loue towards his seruants. By this
Christ is an example to all parents and gouernours: they must
giue tokens of loue in necessarie corrections, that their children
and seruants may be brought from their misdemeanure: for this
end chastisement should be vsed.</p>
            <p>It were to be wished, that all parents and maisters did vse to
giue correction thus: but our case is lamentable in this respect.
Men thinke it enough to prouide foode and raiment for their
houshold: all their care is for the bodie only, and they neuer seeke
to reforme their misdemeanours in life. This negligence brings
many sinnes with it, and pulleth many iudgements vpon vs. So
much for the second point.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Amend.</hi> Againe marke the order of the words: <hi>Rebuke and
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:14859:174"/>
chasten.</hi> Here we haue a necessary instruction, seeing Christ first
propounds a direct end of his chastisement, that is, their amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
which that he may the better effect, first he conuinceth
them, secondly he reprehendeth, and thirdly chasteneth them;
and all these tend to our amendment. A worthie and excellent
order, and to be followed of all gouernors; they must propound
a good end of all chastisements: first the good of the partie cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stised:
then they must vse this order, first a conuiction of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
by the word of God: secondly, reprehension: thirdly, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
if the two former wil not serue. Which being so, you see
how they ouershoote themselues, that make correction serue for
nothing but a meanes of reuenge, an action of choller and rage,
without any purpose to better the partie. Whereas this order v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
would reforme the person, and stop many vices, and nip them
euen in the head: to some it is as good as meate and drinke to be
fighting and brawling.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Be zealous.</hi> Here is a remedie for luke-warmnesse. In the
eight verse they had a remedie for pride: now he maketh a plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
for luke-warmnesse. Here first marke how these words de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
on the former: Christ had said, <hi>Whom I loue, I vse to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stise,</hi>
according as their faults be greater or lesser: therefore see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
I haue corrected thee, repent. Where we are taught the vse
of all reproofes, admonitions and visitations; the speciall end of
them, is to driue vs to amend. As oft as the Lord doth either by
word reproue, or by deed correct vs, it is to shew that we must
repent and amend: therefore whensoeuer you are visited, say
the Lord summons you to repent: take an occasion by the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
of further reformation; yea, know it, that so many afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are so many sermons of Repentance, to make you grow and
increase in faith, repentance and obedience.</p>
            <p>Now that we may the better vnderstand what this comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
<hi>Be zealous</hi> meaneth, diuers points are to be handled:
first, what zeale is. Zeale is an affection, that is compounded of
two affections, loue and indignation, or sorow: therefore first we
must loue Christ aboue all things, if we will be zealous: second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
we must be grieued and angred when Christ is dishonoured.
Loue of religion, and griefe for the want of good successe therof,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:14859:174"/>
will make men zealous. We haue an example in Christ, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.
17. where thus much is signified, that his loue to his father was
so great, that the heate of his indignation had almost consumed
him: he preferred the accomplishment of his Fathers will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all.</p>
            <p>In the second place, note the diuerse kinds of zeale: good,
that is, true: or bad, that is, counterfeit. To a good zeale there
is required, first, true faith: secondly, repentance: thirdly, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
As for faith, it is the very root of good zeale: for as <hi>Paule</hi>
saith, Loue is from faith vnfained. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5. Now zeale is an
affection compounded of loue and faith. And as for repentance,
we see that zeale and it are conioyned in this place. <hi>Iehu</hi> indeed
was zealous, but because he repented not, but liued in the sins
of his predecessors, it was no good zeale. And for the last, we
must know, that zeale without knowledge is but rashnesse.
And thus you see how to distinguish true zeale from counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit,
euen by the companions of it. Now further by the fruites
it may be discerned.</p>
            <p>First, it compelleth a man to please God in all things: it will
enforce one, ouer-rule and maister him. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 13. Whether
we be out of our wit, we are in it vnto God, &amp;c. The very loue of
Christ and his Gospell inforced him, that he could not but
preach. So wheresoeuer this true zeale is in any measure, it will
make a man that he cannot but do his dutie. It will burst foorth
and find an issue,<note place="margin">Iob. 33.</note> like a flame: as <hi>Elihu</hi> said, he could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
his belly would burst. Secondly, It will make a man inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor
to obey God with all his heart, strength &amp; power. <hi>Example.</hi>
Good king <hi>Iosia</hi> turned with all his heart, <hi>Dauid</hi> prayed with
grones vnspeakable: <hi>according to the multitude of thy mercies, &amp;c.</hi>
and so goeth on maruellous earnestly and feruently: he prayed
not slackly and coldly, but with all his force and power, from
the heart, for pardon and reconciliation. And so when he gaue
thankes, he saith, <hi>My soule praise the Lord, and all that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
me, &amp;c. Psal.</hi> 103. 1.</p>
            <p>Thus you see what be the fruites of zeale, and what it is to be
zealous. In a word then it is this, to haue our hearts enflamed
with a loue of Christ and his word aboue all things, and to be
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:14859:175"/>
exceeding angrie when it is disobeyed, enforcing vs to do our
dutie with all the strength we haue. Now to end this point, we
heard before, that lukewarmenesse in religion is our sinne gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
throughout the land, our zeale is cold, and our profession
but formall. How shall we reforme this? Become zealous, beare
a feruent loue to religion, loue Christ aboue all, and be grieued
when you see him dishonored, or his word disobeyed, and false
worship established. Away with this slacknesse in religion, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
it had bene better you had bene of no religion, then
to be neither hote nor cold. A man were better be a Turke or a
Iew, then a lukewarme Christian: for they are better then such,
and such professors are worse then they.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And amend.</hi> This is added, because zeale without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
is but counterfeit zeale, as <hi>Iehues</hi> was. But of what vices
must they repent? Euen of lukewarmenesse. They were not bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
repent because of any grosse sinnes that they had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but for slacknesse in performing good duties. Here is a good
lesson for our common people, which say, because they are no
grosse sinners, as adulterers, theeues, murtherers, but meane
well, hurt no man, and liue peaceably, their case is good. They
despise preaching, and neuer thinke how the want of practising
good duties, is a thing that they should repent for. But they are
to know, that they are summoned to repent for want of good
duties, though they do no euill. This is the diuels inchantment,
he rocketh them asleepe with it. You may haue all these things,
and yet be condemned and go to hell. And yet this is a common
opinion, and spread ouer euery where: but know it, thou maist
liue and die with thy good meaning and peaceable liuing, and
yet be damned, if thou repent not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vers. 20. Behold, I stand at the doore, &amp;c.</hi> Lest any should
despaire, because he had reproued them so sharpely, and mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
them so seuerely, he addeth these words, which are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
the Church against doubting, by shewing signes of his
loue. Now before he setteth downe the speciall tokens of his
loue, he saith, <hi>Behold.</hi> In which very note of attention, we haue
a necessarie instruction, to teach vs, that if we would arme our
selues against doubting, we must acquaint our selues with the
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:14859:175"/>
tokens of Gods loue, lay them to our hearts, and remember
them. We haue of this an example in <hi>Dauid, Psal.</hi> 23. in all the
verses saue the last, he rehearseth Gods goodnesse and his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
blessings: whereupon he inferreth this conclusion; Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
without all doubt I shall liue long to praise God. And all
this came from the particular obseruation of Gods goodnesse;
therefore if you would not stand in doubt of Gods mercie, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
his dealing and his loue in Christ, as plentifull tokens of
his prouidence. They being laid together, worke in vs peace
of conscience, and ioy in the holy Ghost. There is no man so
full of despaire and doubting, but if he lay these things toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and obserue diligently all the tokens of Gods fauour,
he shall find store of comfort: therefore looke backe to your
liues; what tokens of Gods loue you haue receiued, and in the
time of trouble that will be a remedie against desperation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I stand.</hi> Christ expresseth his mind by borrowed speeches:
for in this verse he compareth euery man to a house or houshol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and our hearts to doores by which an entrance is made: and
himselfe to a guest or stranger which cometh to the house, and
desireth to be let in and entertained: yet not so much to looke
for kindnesse to be shewed him, as to shew fauour to vs. By this
similitude Christ purposeth to shew this Church, what his mind
is toward it: and he expresseth it by two signes here set downe:
first, a desire of their conuersion, which he heartily seeketh and
looketh for, <hi>I stand and knocke.</hi> Secondly, his promise after their
conuersion, <hi>If any, &amp;c.</hi> he will haue fellowship, euen mutuall fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship
with them.</p>
            <p>Now of the words in order as they lie. The scope and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of them being thus first thus generally propounded, I
here note two things. First, that this Church (if we regard the
greatest part of it) had not true fellowship with Christ as yet,
nor Christ with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: because he was not yet receiued into their
houses, but stood at their doores which were shut. This may
seeme strange: but the cause is euident, the truth is, there were
many good things in them: for they knew the Gospell and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
it, and professed it, and were partakers of the seales of the
couenant: and yet they were tainted with one great sinne of
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:14859:176"/>
lukewarmenesse, which closed vp the doore of their hearts, so
that though they had many good things, yet this one sinne kept
out Christ. By which we see, that one sinne, in a man indued
with many good graces, keepeth out Christ, and barreth him
from all fellowship and societie with him. <hi>Iudas</hi> had many no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
things in him; he forsooke all, and preached Christ, and
yet couetousnesse kept out Christ. <hi>Herod</hi> had so too, but incest
kept the doore shut against Christ. It is the nature of sinne to
cut a man off from all fellowship with Christ: and so we may
haue many excellent things among vs, as the word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
and yet if thou be a man which hast but one sinne (and
nourishest it) it is a barre to keepe out Christ from entring. If
thou be giuen either to couetousnesse, drunkennes, fornication,
adulterie, theft, blasphemie, or lying, &amp;c. that one sin whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
will keepe out Christ, so that he must be faine to stand and
stay at the doore, and so must abide as long as a man continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in any one sinne. Therefore so many as haue any desire to
haue fellowship with Christ, must haue care to cut off all sinne:
for though thou haue knowledge, wit, memorie, vnderstanding
and vtterance, yet if thou haue but one sinne, it taketh away the
very ground of all fellowship with Christ: that is, of all felicitie
and happinesse.</p>
            <p>In the originall, it is not <hi>I stand,</hi> but <hi>I haue stoode.</hi> So <hi>Ier. 7. 13.
I haue risen vp early:</hi> and <hi>Esa. 65. 2. I haue stretched out my arme
all the day long.</hi> And here, I haue risen vp early, and stood here
long, all the day till night: for so much the word of <hi>supping</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth;
as if he should say, till supper time.</p>
            <p>This sheweth Christs exceeding patience, in waiting for the
conuersion of this people. He might in iustice haue condemned
them for their sinnes, and haue cast them to hell, and yet he stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
still all the day waiting for their conuersion, till he is faine
to complaine.</p>
            <p>Now this place serueth to shew and set foorth, and giueth
iust occasion to speake of Gods patience, in waiting for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion
&amp; amendement of a sinner. Now that which Christ saith
to them, may he iustly say to vs: he hath risen vp early, and
spent a long day in waiting at our doores, aboue sixe and thirtie
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:14859:176"/>
yeares, therefore he may well vpbraide vs. Let vs then learne to
know the day of our visitation:<note place="margin">Luke 19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> for that is the day of a peoples vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitation,
when the Gospel is preached and Christ standeth knoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king:
therefore it stands vs vpon to labour to know this, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
it. If we can resolue our selues of this, then we practise the
dutie which Christ prescribeth the church of Ierusalem<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if we
do not so, but shall let passe all the signes and tokens of Gods
mercy, we must looke for the like end as Ierusalem had. So much
for the first part, <hi>I stand at the doore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And knocke.</hi> First he vsed meanes to enter when they had bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him out. Marke the vnspeakeable mercie of Christ: they by
their sinnes stopt Christ from entring<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet he pursueth them with
mercie, and offereth mercie to them that refused it, and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
themselues to lie and liue in their sinnes. When <hi>Adam</hi> had
sinned and fled from God, the Lord sought him out, and made
a couenant of grace with him. So <hi>Esay</hi> 65. the Lord saith, <hi>he was
found of them that neuer sought him:</hi> they that neuer dreamed of
mercie sound mercie.<note place="margin">Luke 15.</note> In the parable of the lost sheep, that sheep
which was left as a prey to the wild beasts, Christ sought it vp,
and brought it home. All these places tend to one end, to shew
the infinite mercie of Christ. This is true in all churches, yea in
this of ours. If we haue mercie, we haue it before we seeke it, nay
when we refuse it, as much as in vs lieth. This should be an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to stirre vp our hearts to magnifie Christ for his mercie: we
should not let passe such considerations as these, but rather
breake out into praise of Gods loue and mercie, which is a bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomlesse
sea.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> It may be demaunded, how he knockes. <hi>Answ.</hi> The
words precedent shew the sense: for these words haue relation
to them. He said before, he would spue them out: then he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
them counsell. Now by so sharpe a rebuke they might haue
despaired: therefore he shewes, that by this threatning, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke,
and counsell, he knockes, that they might perceiue they
were not tokens of wrath but of mercie. So then this knocking
is nothing else but the reproofe, threatning, and counsell vsed
before. He knocketh when it pleaseth him to make men see their
sinne by such things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="334" facs="tcp:14859:177"/>
Here then we are to marke the state of al people which haue
the ministerie of the word, they haue Christ among them, and
he standeth at the doore and knocketh at euery mans heart. All
threatnings of the law, reproofes of sin, exhortations, admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and promises, they are so many knockes of Christ. A great &amp;
vnspeakeable mercie, that the King of heauen and earth should
do this: Now then doth Christ knocke thus by preaching, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
and threatnings, &amp;c. then we must not be so dull, dead,
and backward, but shew more zeale. If any man of great place
and calling knocke at your doores, what stirring is there, that
you may receiue him as is meete? Then what a shame is this,
when Christ vouchsafeth to deale thus mercifully with vs? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
in that Christ cometh by the ministery of the Gospell to
work our conuersion, it serueth to admonish vs to turne with all
speed, for we know not how long he will stand and reach forth
the hand of his ministerie to beate vpon our hearts. Marke fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
this knocking is not a light and soft kind of knocking, but
it goeth with crying; he both knocketh and crieth, it is an earnest
knocking of one that would faine enter.</p>
            <p>Seeing then Christ standing at the doore of mens hearts knoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
so earnestly to saue mens soules, we againe ought to be ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
to receiue and embrace the Gospell. He knocketh in good
earnest, and we must accordingly by Gods grace be as earnest.
So much for the first token of Christs loue, his desire of their
conuersion, which he sheweth by two signes; first his waiting, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
his knocking, and that ioyned with crying.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If any man, &amp;c.</hi> Now followeth the second token, namely, a
promise of fellowship with them after their conuersion. These
words haue bene much abused, therefore I wil stand a litle to set
downe the meaning. Marke the forme of speech, it is such as see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to giue a man an action in his owne conuersion, whereby
he comes and receiues Christ. So it attributes to mans will an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
as if he should say, I for my part stand and knocke, if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any man heare &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This may seeme strange, that such an action should be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that is dead in sin. But this speech is vsed for iust cause;
for in the conuersion of a sinner there be three agents: first, the
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:14859:177"/>
holy Ghost: secondly, the word: thirdly, mans will. The principal
agent and worker is the holy Ghost, which changeth the mind
and will from euill to good, the will by nature willing nothing
but that which is against the will of God. Secondly, the word,
which is an instrument of the holy Ghost, for he works not now
ordinarily by reuelation, or speciall instinct and inspiration, but
when a man is reading or hearing the word, and applying it to
his heart, then the holy Ghost workes in and by the word, that
being the power of God to saluation, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> faith to faith. Thirdly,
the wil though it be dead by nature, &amp; can do nothing of it self:
yet when the holy Ghost begins to moue it, it moues it self, and
striues to be altered whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God moues it. We must not think ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
wil is like a peece of wax, which hath no actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but only passiuely
receiues and impression: but the will being disposed, moues and
stirres it selfe. Euen as fire, so soone as it is kindled it burnes,
and as soone as it burnes is fire: so when God hath once giuen
grace, the will moueth, the mind seeth and acknowledgeth sin,
and the will inclined by the holy Ghost begins a strife against
sin, and makes a man endeuour to please God so much as he can.
So the will in the very first conuersion hath his action, though
not by nature but by grace. Now considering these three actions
concurre in the conuersion of a sinner, hence it is that actions are
ascribed to sinners which are to be conuerted, as here and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
other places, not that they can do any thing of themselues
without Christ, but when they are wrought vpon by the holy
Ghost. Thus a man hath a free will in his first conuersio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by grace:
as fire hath some effects of fire so soone as euer it is kindled:
therefore it is said, <hi>Repent and beleeue,</hi> to impenitent persons; not
because they can do it of themselues, but because when it shall
please the holy Ghost to worke it in their hearts by the word,
they can turne, and vse good meanes. This is the cause why the
holy Ghost ascribes an action to such persons: when God giues
grace to receiue Christ, then it receiueth Christ: when God o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
the heart by that grace, it is enabled to receiue Christ.</p>
            <p>This being the true meaning of these words, let vs see how
this text hath bene abused, first by Papists, which gather hereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
that a man hath free will in his conuersion by nature: that he hath
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:14859:178"/>
and that is the faith which sets open the heart wide to receiue
Christ. Thus if you shall humble your selues, and acknowledge
your vnworthinesse, and lay hold on Christ with true faith, and
testifie it by feruent loue to Christ and his members, then shall
your hearts be open indeed, and you shall receiue Christ. Thus
much for the true meaning of the condition.</p>
            <p>It followeth, <hi>I wil sup, &amp;c.</hi> This is the promise it self, namely a
mutual fellowship with Christ: this is the ground of al ioy, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
&amp; happines: therfore it is here propounded as the principal
thing, and it hath two parts: first, I will sup with him: secondly,
and he with me. The true communion betweene Christ and his
members, stands in these two things. Here is a double feast, and
these two containe the summe and substance of <hi>Salomons</hi> book
called the Canticles: for there Christ entertaineth &amp; feasteth the
church, and the church feasteth him. For the first, <hi>I will sup with
him.</hi> How? <hi>Cant. 4. end. Come my wel beloued and eate of the delicate
things and pleasant fruites:</hi> there you may see how euery Christian
soule conuerted, makes Christ a feast, to wit, with the fruites of
true repentance. Psal. 51. <hi>The broken and contrite heart,</hi> that is a
most worthie part of the feast, and a sacrifice acceptable to God.
Secondly, <hi>a beleeuing heart,</hi> for without saith it is vnpossible to
please God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. and when we giue vp our bodies and soules
a liuing sacrifice. <hi>Rom</hi> 12. 1. bring broken, beleeuing, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
harts: these are the dishes and delicates wherewith Christ
is fed, wherein he delights. <hi>And he with me.</hi> We must also be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
by Christ: for Christ comes not for this end to be entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
but to entertaine. The feast which Christ makes, is his own
bodie and bloud in the administration of his Supper: his bodie
is true meate, and his bloud is true drinke. And the vessels in
which it is serued out, are the seales of the word; and the guests
are penitent sinners, which haue broken hearts, which hunger
and thirst after Christ. Now from this feast ariseth righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
peace of conscience, and ioy in the holy Ghost. <hi>Rom.</hi>
14. 17. All ioy that heart can thinke comes by this feast. Now
seeing Christ makes these promises as a principall token of his
loue, we must make some vse of them. We must renounce all our
carnal vanities and earthly delights, and giue our selues no more
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:14859:178"/>
to surfetting and drunkennesse, and sumptuous banquetting.
Here is a better kind of feasting, therefore turne your eyes from
those, lift vp your hearts, and haue care to entertaine Christ:
feast him with the graces that God hath giuen you, and labor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
to be feasted of him, feed of his bodie and bloud to life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall.
Labour to be acquainted with these, that you may know
by experience how Christ feasts you, and you him. You know
one friend how to entertaine another, euerie man according to
his dignitie: but you should haue more care of this spirituall and
mutuall entertainment betweene Christ and you.</p>
            <p>Againe, see here a notable abuse of those that come to the
Lords table: for marke how these two go together, Christ feasts
vs, and we must feast him, so that there may be an enterchange
of feasting: but our communicants come to the Lords table, and
they will haue Christ feast then, but they will not feast him,
whereas we should feast him daily by faith, obedience, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
and good duties of our callings: but we like churlish &amp;
vngratefull <hi>Nabals,</hi> haue not one good dish to feast him withall.
This is our shame. Or if we be good guests for a day, yet after
that is past, we haue no care to entertaine Christ. Looke to it
therefore, and see that you feed Christ, not by your owne natural
power, but by your gifts of grace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To him that ouercometh, &amp;c.</hi> This is the conclusion of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle,
in which note two parts: first, a promise: secondly, a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept.
The promise: <hi>To him that ouercometh,</hi> that is, he that holds
out, keeping faith and a good conscience against all the enemies
of his saluation. <hi>Shall sit:</hi> that is haue fellowship with Christ in his
glorie. Christ doth not promise equall glorie and honor, for that
is not possible for anie creature, because he is the head of his
church, but onely a participation: as if he should say, he shall be
partaker of my glorie, so farre as shall be meete and conuenient
for him: as appeareth by the words following. But this (wil some
say) is no great matter. True, the carnall heart of man may sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
so: therefore he addes, as <hi>I ouercame, &amp;c.</hi> This is no small
glorie, for like as my father did aduance me when I had ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
so will I aduance all my members, when they haue ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
their spirituall enemies. Now as Christ is inferiour to the
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:14859:179"/>
Father, as he is Mediator, and yet sits with him: so the members
of Christ may sit with him, and yet be vnequall to him in
glorie.</p>

was deliuered to him a booke containing the
Prophecie of the Prophet <hi>Esay.</hi> Which after he
had opened, at the first he found the place where it was written
in these words: <hi>The spirit of the Lord is vpon me, because he hath
annoynted me, that I should preach the Gospell to the poore: He hath
sent me that I should heale the broken in heart, that I should preach
deliuerance to the captiues, and sight to the blind, that I should set at
libertie them that are bruised, and to preach the acceptable yeare
of the Lord.</hi> Then after he had closed the booke, and deliuered
it to the Minister, he sate downe to preach, and the eyes of all
them that were in the congregation were bent vpon him. Then
he opened his mouth, and spake vnto them these words: <hi>This
day is this Scripture fulfilled in your eares, and they all gaue him te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie
that it was so.</hi> In like maner may I say, concerning this
place of Scripture which I haue read vnto you: In your eyes and

            <p>
               <pb n="342" facs="tcp:14859:180"/>
The last time that I spake in this auditorie, I intreated of the
flourishing and prosperous estate of Ierusalem, which is the
Church of God, set foorth in the 122. Psalme, and therefore
good order now requireth, that I should speake of the decay
and ouerthrow of the enemie of Ierusalem, which is Babylon,
the See and Church of Antichrist: and for that purpose princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally,
haue I chosen this text of Scripture to speake of: that by
the one we might be enflamed with loue of the true Church of
Christ, and by the other be moued to the hatred of that false
Church of Antichrist. Now this text of Scripture <hi>(She is fallen,
she is fallen, euen Babylon that great citie, for of the wine of the fury
of her fornication she, hath giuen all nations to drinke)</hi> offereth me
three speciall things to be considered: first, what Babylon is: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
what is become of her: and thirdly, what is the cause of
her heauie decay.</p>
            <p>In the first part, by the assistance of God, I shall plainely
shew and proue, that Babylon is Rome: In the second, that Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon
or Rome, by the iust iudgement of God is fallen, yea, she
is fallen: In the last, the reason of this so sharpe sentence of God
against her, because she hath deceiued all the world with drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse
and whoredome. Within the compasse of these three
propositions I will keep my selfe in all my discourse: sauing that
by your fauour, forasmuch as this is the middle voice of three
Angels that speake in this Chapter, for a Preface, I will vse the
voice of the first Angell, of whose preaching this my text is a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent:
and in the stead of a conclusion I will touch the voyce
of the third Angel, which is a consequent of this the middle An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
voice. Concerning the preface, it shall be this in few words.
After that S. <hi>Iohn</hi> had described the preseruation and vnitie of
the Church of God in Christ their head, euen in the midst of the
furie of Antichrist, vnder the figure of the Lambe standing on
mount Sion with 144000. of his chast worshippers: next he
declareth that God would bring the same againe into the sight
of the world by preaching of the Gospell, and the ouerthrow
of the kingdome of Antichrist. Wherefore he sendeth an Angell
flying in the midst of heauen, or betweene heauen and earth,
bringing with him an euerlasting Gospell, and preaching that
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:14859:180"/>
all men should feare God, and giue glorie to his name, for the
time of his iudgement was at hand, and that they should wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
him that made heauen and earth, and all things that are in
them. A very Angelicall sermon indeed, &amp; an euerlasting Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
is that, (howsoeuer the enemies charge it with noueltie)
that teacheth to feare God, to giue glorie to his name, and to
worship him onely that is the Creator of heauen and earth. And
a consequent of that Gospell is this Sermon of the Angell. <hi>She
is fallen, she is fallen, euen Babylon that great Citie.</hi> For wheresoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
men are taught to feare God aright, to giue all glorie to
him alone, and to worship none other but him that made hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
and earth, and all things in them contained: there must
needes follow a great fal and ouerthrow of Babylon, and Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonicall
religion, which teacheth the contrarie. Wherefore if
we loue the peace of Ierusalem, to the ouerthrow of this her
great aduersarie, let vs imbrace this euerlasting Gospell, that we
feare God, glorifie God, and worship God alone. Againe, if
we hate Babylon with a perfect hatred; as we ought to do, and
therefore would seeke her vtter ruine and decay: let vs procure
that this Gospell may be preached, that men may learn to feare,
honour, and serue God onely, and then vndoubtedly Babylon
shall fall, she shall fall I say, she can stand no longer. Let this
suffice therefore for a Preface.</p>
            <p>Now haue we to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider, what Babylon is. I haue vndertaken
to proue, that Babylon here spoken of; is Rome. But first I must
admonish you, how I vnderstand Rome. And that is not onely
for a certaine place in Italy, compassed about with walles, and
furnished with buildings, as other cities are: but for that autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
gouernment and preheminence which is challenged by
meanes of that citie, or for the Romaine Empire, which is clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by prerogatiue of the same citie: and so is Babylon taken
in the Scripture, and namely in this Prophecie. For in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth
Chapter of this Reuelation, the same great citie is called
also Sodoma and Aegyptus, where our Lord was crucified: So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doma,
for the great abhomination and filthinesse therein main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
and Aegyptus, because it keepeth the people of God in
miserable bondage and slauerie, as Aegypt vnder <hi>Pharao</hi> did of
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:14859:181"/>
old. Whereby it is manifest, that the great citie is to be taken
for that tyrannie, gouernment, and preheminence, as I said,
which is challenged in the right of that great Citie: and so is the
regiment and gouernance of the Romaine Antichrist, depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
vpon the prerogatiue of his See, which is Rome. Now if
any will contend, that Babylon must be taken in the proper
sense, for a citie in Chaldea onely, as though we should looke
for the See of Antichrist out of the East (as the Papists for thirty
or fortie yeares ago deuised a fable, that was renewed also in
Queene <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, of a monstrous child which should be
borne at Babylon, which they would haue men suppose to be
Antichrist:) he may be flatly conuicted of great ignorance, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the Angell in the seuenteenth Chapter of this Prophecie testifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that her name is Babylon in a mysterie, as in the eleuenth
Chapter, that she is spiritually called Sodoma and Aegyptus,
not in respect of situation of the place, but in similitude and
likenesse of conditions.</p>
            <p>Wherefore it remaineth, that (according to my promise) I
proue Babylon here mentioned, to be Rome. The greatest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie
that this day troubleth the world, is, where the true
Church of God should be: the Papists making great bragges,
that it is on their side, &amp; we affirming that it is on our side. This
controuersie will soone be cut off, and brought to an end, if it
may be shewed that Babylon is Rome: for then cannot Rome
be the Church of Christ, but the Church of Antichrist. And
therefore it standeth me vpon, to bring very good and substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
proofes, to maintaine this my assertion, that Babylon is
Rome. But what proofes may be counted sufficient? Is not the
authoritie of holy Scriptures, and the testimonie of auncient
Doctors of the Church good and substantiall proofes? Therfore
if authoritie of Scriptures be a good and substantiall proofe, ye
shall haue Scriptures: if consent of auncient Writers in the same
sentence be of any value, you shall haue plentie.</p>
            <p>And first beginning with Scriptures, I will not alledge such
places as be hard and darke to vnderstand, but such as be plaine,
euident, and manifest, and can receiue no other interpretation,
to satisfie the iudgement of any reasonable man. I omit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:14859:181"/>
so many figures as in this Reuelation do not very obscurely
signifie, but euen directly point at and paint out that Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Church. For although they do so aptly and fitly agree ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
as a man might easily iudge they were made euen for the
same purpose: yet because they might be wrested to some other
meaning, if manifest places did not withstand, I will leaue all
aduantage that I might take of them, and hold me onely at this
time to those plaine and euident demonstrations, which with
no equitie nor conscience can admit any other interpretation.
Onely I will here note, that forasmuch as all figures, types, and
colours contained in this booke may so conueniently be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Rome, as though they had bene properly appointed to
describe her, (as they were indeed) it is great preiudice against
Rome, although no plainer proofes might be brought. But
when so plaine arguments are brought foorth, that without too
much impudencie cannot be auoided, and all other figures and
darke speeches agree accordingly, it is a manifest coniunction
that Rome is none other but this Babylon.</p>
            <p>But to begin with these plaine places (as I haue promised,)
the first shall be out of the eleuenth Chapter of this Reuelation,
the place before alleaged: where it is declared, that God in all
times, yea in the greatest persecution, would maintaine his
Church, and reserue at the least two witnesses which should te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
of his truth, in spite of Antichrist and his adherents. Which
although the monstrous beast that ariseth out of the bottome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
pit, should murther and slay, yet God should restore them
to life again, continually stirring vp a sufficient number to beare
witnesse of his name and doctrine. In that Chapter I say is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
that when the beast had murthered them, he should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie
them the honour of buriall, and so their bodies should lye in
the streete or market place of that great citie, which is spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
called Sodoma and Aegyptus, where our Lord was crucified.
Declaring thereby, that as Rome had slaine and crucified the
head, so should Rome persecute the members. And in the same
Citie where their Lord was murthered, the seruants should be
persecuted.</p>
            <p>But here a man would thinke that I were impudent to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:14859:182"/>
that our Sauiour Christ was crucified at Rome, whome
all the world knoweth to haue suffered death at Ierusalem. But
you must call to remembrance, that at the first I gaue warning,
that I did not vnderstand Rome for the topographie of Rome,
that is, so much ground onely as is compassed within the walles
of that Citie, but for the regiment, gouernance and prerogatiue
that is claymed, by reason of that Citie or Monarchie, whereof
Rome is the head: and then I shall easily proue that Christ was
crucified at Rome.</p>
            <p>For by whome was he condemned? was it not by <hi>Pilate</hi> the
Deputie or Lieutenant of the Romain Empire? For what cause
or crime was he adiudged to die? was it not for treason preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to be committed against the Romaine Empire? With what
kind of execution was he put to death? was it not such as was v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall
by the lawes of the Romaines, for such hainous offences
as were vniustly laid to his charge? Finally, was not the place
wherein he suffered, within the circuit of the Romaine Empire?
May I not then iustly affirme that he was crucified at Rome, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
by the Romaine Iudge he was condemned for a crime against
the Romaine state, and executed by a kind of death appointed
by the Romaine lawes, and in a place of the Romaine domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
As for the Iewes, they had at that time no authoritie to put
any man to death, as they confesse themselues, when <hi>Pilate</hi> bad
them take him, and iudge him according to their owne lawe,
meaning they shold decree some light punishment against him.
They answered: It is not lawfull for vs to iudge him to dye. As
touching the cause, although they accused him of blasphemie, in
that he made himselfe the Sonne of God: yet could he not be
condemned for that, because <hi>Pilate</hi> would admit no accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but such as contained a crime against the Romaine lawes.
And as for the death of the crosse, it is manifest to be proper to
the Romaines: for the Iewes would haue stoned him, if they
might haue condemned him for blasphemie, according to the
law of <hi>Moises.</hi> And that the Angell in that place by no meanes
can vnderstand Ierusalem, it is manifest by these reasons: first,
that he calleth it that great citie; which tearme could neuer be
spoken of Ierusalem. Also he calleth it Sodoma and Aegyptus,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:14859:182"/>
which was the sea of the monstrous beast Antichrist, which in
other places is often called Babylon. Whereas no man euer did
imagine that Ierusalem should be called Sodome, Aegypt, or
Babylon. Adde hereunto, that Ierusalem, the place where
Christ suffered, was vtterly destroyed in S. <hi>Iohns</hi> time, whereby
it is euident, that by this great citie, spiritually called Babylon,
Sodoma, and Aegyptus, is meant none other but the Romaine
Empire, which crucified the head, and should also bring foorth
to put any man to death: and he hath deserued the monstrous
beast Antichrist, which should torment and afflict the members,
which began with murther of the Lord, and should continue,
till it were destroyed, in murthering of the seruants. And by this
plaine text, which cannot be wrested to any other sense, this
great citie of Babylon, where Christ was crucified, is proued to
be Rome, and the authoritie, rule, and power of the Romaine
Citie.</p>
            <p>The second plaine and euident proofe which I will vse at this
time, shall be taken out of the thirteenth Chapter of this Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
where that euill shapen beast is described, which is the
head of the persecuting malignant Church, hauing seuen heads
and ten hornes: and is the same which afterward in the seuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
Chapter beareth the great whore Babylon, the mother
of all abhominations of the earth. Who so therefore will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
these things that are written in this booke, concerning
the description of that monstrous beast, with those things that
the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> in the seuenth Chapter of his Prophecie,
describeth of the foure beasts, and specially of the fourth, which
all men confesse to be the Romaine Empire: except he be too
much blinded with frowardnes and peruerse affection, he must
needes acknowledge, that this Beast which <hi>Iohn</hi> painteth out,
is the same that <hi>Daniel</hi> setteth out: which containing in it the
crueltie of the Leopard, the Beare and the Lion, which were
the former Monarchies, is vnlike to them all, and therefore is
the fourth Empire, which all the world acknowledgeth to be
the Monarchie of Rome. What should I speake of the number
of the hornes, equall in both, and generally of all other parts of
their description, which is set foorth so like, and almost with
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:14859:183"/>
the same words, both of the one and of the other, that it were
meere madnesse to imagine that this beast which <hi>Iohn</hi> descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,
should be any other, then that <hi>Daniel</hi> had so long before
portraited. Then if the Beast in <hi>Daniels</hi> description doth sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
the fourth kingdome, as the Angell expoundeth it, which
no man will denie to be the Romaine Monarchie: the same
monstrous Beast, being here painted out in this Reuelation, with
the same shape, colours and conditions, must needes signifie
the Romaine Empire, and so Babylon by this reason also is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to be Rome.</p>
            <p>The third argument or proofe is taken out of the seuenteenth
Chapter of this Reuelation, and the ninth verse: where the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
expounding to Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the mysterie of the Beast with the
seuen heades, declareth in very plaine wordes, that the seuen
heades do signifie seuen hilles, whereon the woman sitteth.
Now seeing it is euident, that the woman signifieth a great Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
we must see where we can find a great Citie builded vpon
seuen hilles, and that by the interpretation of the Angell is Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,
the See of Antichrist. And if we seeke throughout the
whole world, where shall we find a great Citie builded vpon
seuen hils, but that great citie in Italie? which all Writers Poets,
Historians, Cosmographers, with one consent do confesse to be
Rome, which is builded vpon seuen hilles, whose names are
these: <hi>Palatinus, Capitolinus, Auentinus, Exquilinus, Viminae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,
Quirinalis,</hi> and <hi>Caelius.</hi> This is so plaine a notation of Rome
to be Babylon, builded on seuen hilles, that the Angell could
not more plainely haue expressed Rome, though he had named
her. Nay this is a more euident and certain description of Rome
to be the See of Antichrist, then if in plaine words he had said,
Babylon is Rome. For it might be, that some other citie then
that here was meant, might haue the name of Rome, but no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
citie could haue this notation, to be builded on seuen hils.
For Constantinople was afterward called new Rome, but
Constantinople was not builded vpon seuen hilles like vnto
old Rome. Therefore this is a plaine and manifest circumlocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Rome, which with no reason can receiue any other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="349" facs="tcp:14859:183"/>
For what boy going to the Grammer schoole, and reading in
<hi>Virgils Georgickes</hi> this verse: <hi>Septem quae vna sibi muro circundedit
arces:</hi> That citie (saith <hi>Virgil)</hi> which hath compassed seuen hils
within her walles. What boy, I say, in the Grammer schoole
doth not vnderstand this to be meant of the citie of Rome, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the Poet in that place doth not once name Rome? With
what face therefore will any man denie, that the Angell here
meaneth any other citie by this Periphrasis and circumlocution,
then Rome? For if any will be so froward to except, that the word
of hils is not taken in the proper sense, but figuratiuely and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorically
for some other thing, as some would seem to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prete
seuen hils in this place for seuen kingdoms, he shal plainly
be conuinced by these reasons: first, it were absurd that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
should repeat one thing twise; for in the next clause he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that the seuen heads do signifie kingdoms also: but specially
we must remember, that this is an interpretation of the Angell,
which must either be plaine and easie to be vnderstood, or it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth
not the name of an interpretation. Therefore if the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell,
offering to expound the mysterie of the seuen heads, giueth
this exposition, that they signifie seuen hils: if hils be not taken
in their proper sense, to what purpose serueth this exposition?
For if the name of hils hath need of another exposition, he had
bene as good to haue left the name of heads vnexpounded. And
as for the interpretation of hils to signifie Kings, is more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure,
darke, and far fet, then that heads should represent Kings;
for it is more apt by metaphor to call a King an head, then to cal
him an hill. Therefore except we will say, that the interpretation
of the Angell is vaine, yea more darke then the thing that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
by him, we must needes confesse that hils are taken in
their proper sense for hils, and then the citie builded vpon seuen
hilles without all controuersie is the citie of Rome.</p>
            <p>The fourth and last proofe that I will take out of the holy
scripture, is the last verse of the same seuenteenth chapter, which
is yet a more plaine description of Rome, if any thing can be
more plaine then that hath bene alreadie spoken: for there the
Angell in plaine words expoundeth, that the woman which S.
<hi>Iohn</hi> saw, which was the great whoore Babylon, is that great Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:14859:184"/>
which hath dominion ouer the Kings of the earth. What
brazen face is so impudent, to denie that Rome was that great
citie which had dominion ouer the Kings of the earth at that
time when this was spoken? Or what other citie had dominion
ouer the Kings of the earth in S. <hi>Iohns</hi> time, but Rome? Who is
therefore so froward and vntoward, that he will not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
Babylon here to be plainly called Rome? If I should name
the chiefe city of England, who would not vnderstand London?
If I should speake of the chiefest citie of France, who would not
conceiue Paris? And when the Angell named the chiefe citie of
the world, who could be ignorant, liuing in that time, or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the history of that time, that he vnderstood it of the citie of
Rome, which was the sea of the Empire, and from whence we
should looke that Antichrist should come, according to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
prophesies? For it is a shame in this place to flie vnto alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories,
and further expositions of this Angelicall interpretation,
which as I said before, if it be not cleare, plaine, and easie to be
vnderstood, deserueth not the name of an exposition: as when
one knoweth one vnknowne thing is expounded by another as
much or more vnknowne, it is vaine, superfluous, and ridiculous.
Wherefore, whom any bonds of reason will hold in, they must
be satisfied with the exposition of the Angell, that Babylon is
Rome. For seeing it was necessary for the Church of God, to
know aswell the place where Antichrist should fit, as to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
of his craft and crueltie: our Sauiour Christ, the author
of this Reuelation, would not suffer his congregation to be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
thereof, but sent his Angell plainely to interprete and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
the vision of the great whoore, that the Church being
throughly admonished of her wickednesse, and instructed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
to know her, might more easily take heed of her, flie from
her, and abhor her: so that according to my promise I haue suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
proued by authoritie of holy Scriptures, this first propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
which I tooke in hand, that Babylon is Rome.</p>
            <p>But because some are of such obstinate and wilful frowardnes,
that nothing will satisfie them, but they will still grudge and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine,
carpe, and obiect against my interpretations of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
(for the texts they cannot deny) I wish them that are such, if
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:14859:184"/>
they like not these expositions, which I haue brought to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facing
of Antichrist and his religion, that then they admit and
reuerence those expositions, which their owne authors bring
for the maintenance of the Popes authoritie and his religion:
of which sort are these: <hi>God</hi> (saith <hi>Moses</hi> in Genesis) <hi>made two
great lights, the Sunne to rule the day, and the Moone to gouerne
the night:</hi> that is, saith the famous Interpreter, God ordained the
Pope and the Emperour to rule the world. By the Sun is meant
the Pope, and by the Moone the Emperour: and looke how
much greater and more glorious the Sunne is then the Moone,
so much greater and more glorious is the Pope then the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.
And not content with this, he counteth by Arithmeticke
how much greater the Sunne is in quantitie then the Moone,
by proportion that it hath to the earth, and so by many parts he
concludeth that the Pope is greater then the Emperor. But here
a man might help him, what by Geometrie, and what by Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meticke,
for where as the Sunne is 166. times greater then the
earth, and the earth 39. times greater then the Moone (as is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
by Mathematicall demonstration) the Pope should be 6474
times greater then the Emperour. This is one noble exposition
that is set forth to aduance the dignitie of the Pope and his
kingdome.</p>
            <p>Another like to this, is vpon the words of the Apostles, which
answered vnto our Sauiour Christ, when he commaunded him
that had no sword to sell his coate and buy one, signifying the
great daunger that was at hand: <hi>Lord</hi> (say they) <hi>here are two
swords.</hi> These swords (saith the Glosar) are the Ciuill and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall
power which remained in <hi>Peter,</hi> and therefore his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor
the Pope hath preheminence of both. No doubt a worthy
interpretation, and that agreeth well with the text, and doth the
Pope great worship. Againe, S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith to the Corinthians, 1.
<hi>Cor. 2. The spirituall man iudgeth all things, and he himselfe is iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
of none.</hi> This spirituall man, saith the Interpreter, is the Pope,
which is Iudge of all the world, and may not be controlled of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
man, no though he draw with him innumerable soules into
hell fire, there to be tormented with the diuell and him for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more;
yet no man must be so bold as to find fault with him, or to
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:14859:185"/>
say, <hi>Domine, quid ita facis?</hi> Lord, why do you so? Is not this an
handsome exposition? Yea I promise you, euen like vnto this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
<hi>Statuimus vt Clerici nec comam nutriant, nec barbam radant:</hi>
We decree (saith the Canon of an auncient Councell) that the
Clergie shall neither weare long haire, nor shaue their beards.
The Glosar finding this Canon to be so cleane co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary vnto the
custome of the Popish Clergie, who vse to weare long haire and
to shaue their beards, thought he would draw it, at the least if it
would not come by faire meanes, to maintaine the laudable cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
of the Popish Clergie: and by exposition of one word, he
maketh the whole Canon to serue his turne. Therefore <hi>Statui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
(saith he) which is, we decree, is to be expounded for <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogamus,</hi>
which is, we disanul or abrogate, and so the sense after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
falleth out very plaine for the popish Priests thus: We disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nul
that Prists shold go without long haire, or vnshauen beards.
A right cunning interpretation, and proper for the place: and
such in effect are all those that serue for the maintenance of the
Popes authoritie, and the religion of Poperie. Therefore he that
is of so sharpe iudgement, that he will mislike and refuse those
plaine expositions which I haue brought of the places before al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged,
and except against them, as inforced, constrained, and far
fetched: let him like of, praise, magnifie, and admire these inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations,
which are sought to vphold and establish the Popes
throne and religion, as rightly, faithfully, and truly collected. <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
idem iungat Vulpes, &amp; mulgeat Hireos:</hi> and by as good reason
let him ioyne for his plough not Oxes but Foxes, and milke for
his paile, not she Goates but he Goates, as the Poet saith.</p>
            <p>Now that I haue proued Babylon to be Rome by authoritie
of Scripture, it followeth that I must shew for the same the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of auncient Doctors. And as in my former probation I tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
onely such places as did plainly, directly, and manifestly set
forth my purpose, so in this behalf I wil deale with the Doctors.
Not such as they are wont to alleage against vs, names indeed
of great and reuerent antiquitie, but workes of meere falshood
and forgery, bewraying their authors not to be such as they are
fathered vpon, but such as out of the bodie of blindnesse and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition
of much later time haue begotten them. Such are the
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:14859:185"/>
decretal Epistles of the old Bishops of Rome, <hi>Linus, Cleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cletus,</hi>
&amp;c. Of which, <hi>Cleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi> writing to S. <hi>Iames</hi> forsooth in his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Epistle chargeth him very earnestly that the Pixe be cleanly
kept, so that there appeare no Mise dong, or any other filthines
among the fragments of the body of Christ, with many other
like Apostolicall commaundements. The impudencie of whose
authors appeareth notably in this, that whereas they were ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
buzzards that could not write true Latine, they
would ascribe their counterfeit Epistles to so learned fathers, as
though at that time when women and children spake Latine
naturally as their mother tong, the Bishops were so vnlearned,
that they did write so barbarously, and were not able to vtter
their mind in true Latine.</p>
            <p>But leauing those delicates for such as long after them, I will
vse no authoritie for this purpose, but such as they cannot refuse,
but that that is auncient, catholike, and autenticall. I will begin
therefore with <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> one of the most auncient and autenticall
writers that the Church hath: who in the fift booke of his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
against all heresies, speaking of the sea of Antichrist, vpon
the last verse of the 13. chapter of this Reuelation, where it is
said, that the number of the beasts name is six hundred, sixtie and
sixe, sheweth that the opinion of many in his time was, that see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Latini enim sunt qui nunc regnant.</hi> Also (saith he) this
name <hi>LATEINOS,</hi> containing the number of 666. is
thought to be the name of Antichrist: and it is very like so to be,
for that which most vndoubtedly is a kingdome hath that name:
for they be Latines which now do raigne.</p>
            <p>You see by this testimonie of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> that this prophecie of
old time was vnderstood of Rome, and that the mumber of the
beasts name is to be found in one that beareth rule at Rome. If
this exposition or explication of the beasts name had bene deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by <hi>Luther, Zwinglius,</hi> or <hi>Caluin,</hi> it might haue bene suspected
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:14859:186"/>
as a thing imagined of spite and enuy against the Church of
Rome, but when it is brought forth by so auncient a Doctor,
which liued not many yeares after this Reuelation was giuen, as
he himself saith, that it was but a litle before his time, vnder <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitian</hi>
the Emperor, which died thirteene hundred yeares before
<hi>Luther</hi> was borne: we must needs iudge it both to be very aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
and voide of all partialitie. Wherefore I will passe ouer di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
other applications of that number to other names, which
neuerthelesse hit Babylon home, because they haue bene sought
out of late by such as beare il wil vnto Rome. For I thinke this is
sufficient with all reasonable men of equall iudgement, to proue
that this is no new opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to seek the sea of Antichrist at Rome.
They themselues to proue their doctrine catholicke, alleage au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
of eleuen or twelue hundred yeares antiquitie: behold,
this opinion is thirteene or foureteene hundred yeares old, that
Antichrist should be a Romaine, and that the sea of his tyrannie
should be at Rome.</p>
            <p>The second witnesse of this assertion that Babylon is Rome,
is <hi>Tertullianus,</hi> a very auncient writer also, who in plaine words
affirmeth, that Babylon signifieth Rome, in the third booke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Martion,</hi> which denied that Christ had a true bodie.
Wherefore <hi>Tertullian</hi> vseth this reason against him: <hi>That thing
which hath a figure of it, must be a thing of truth:</hi> and so discoursing
of many things figured, and the figures of them, cometh to these
words: <hi>Sic &amp; Babylon apud Iohannem nostrum, Romana vrbis figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram
portat, perinde &amp; magna, &amp; regno superbae, &amp; sanctorum debel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latricis:</hi>
that is to say, euen so doth Babylon (in the Apocalips of
our S. <hi>Iohn)</hi> beare the figure of the citie of Rome, which is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
as great, and as proud in raigne, and as great a persecutor
of the Saints, as Babylon was. You see therefore most clearely
and plainely, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> with all his learning could not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprete
these things that be written in this Reuelation concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Babylon, to be applied to any other citie then Rome: and
he is also a witnesse voide of all partialitie or affection to either
part of them that striue in our dayes; for he departed neare about
foureteene hundred yeares before our time: why should he not
then be credited in this case?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="355" facs="tcp:14859:186"/>
Well, next vnto him I will ioyne <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarie
vpon the second Epistle to the Thessalonians, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
chapter, in his fourth Homilie: where as S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaking
of the manifestation of Antichrist, saith, they knew what was
the stay, that he was not presently reuealed. But when that stay
is taken away, he should be reuealed in his due time. <hi>Chrysostome</hi>
expoundeth this stay to be the Romaine Empire, which must
giue place vnto Antichrist: that like as the Persians came in place
of the Chaldeans, the Grecians in place of the Persians, and the
Romaines in place of the Grecians: euen so Antichrist should
inuade the Empire of the Romaines. <hi>Vacantem imperij principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
inuadet, &amp; tentabit ad se rapere hominum &amp; Dei imperium:</hi>
Antichrist (saith he) shall inuade the vacant principalitie of the
Empire, and shall assay to draw vnto himselfe the Empires both
of God and men. And is it not manifest that the Papacie grew
and tooke increase by the decay of the Empire, and at the fall of
the Monarchie, chalenged full possession of all dominion, both
spirituall and temporall?</p>
            <p>Of the same iudgement is S. <hi>Ierome</hi> writing vpon the same
place of <hi>Paul,</hi> vnto <hi>Algasia,</hi> in the eleuenth question, whose
words are these: <hi>Nec vult apertè dicere Romanum imperium de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struendum,
quod ipsi qui imperant aeternum putant, vnde secundum
Apocalypsim Iohannis in fronte purpuratae meretricis scriptum est
nomen blasphemiae, id est Romae aeternae, &amp;c.</hi> that is, neither will he
openly say, that the Romane Empire shold be destroyed, which
they that gouerne it thinke to be euerlasting: wherefore accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Reuelation of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> in the forehead of the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
whoore there is written a name of blasphemie, which is,
<hi>Rome euerlasting.</hi> Lo, here another witnesse of good antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and sufficient credite, which not onely agreeth plainely with
<hi>Chrysostome,</hi> that Antichrist should take possession of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
Empire when it should be decayed in the Emperours:
but also most plainely agreeing with <hi>Tertullian,</hi> calleth that Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonicall
strumpet, which is described in the seuenteenth
chapter of this Apocalypse, that purple whoore of Rome, and
the name of blasphemie, to be <hi>Rome euerlasting:</hi> as though he
had heard the Pope brag of the eternitie of his sea, which he
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:14859:187"/>
saith is the rocke, against which the gates of hell cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile.
But he is foully beguiled, for Rome the sea of his Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
is by Saint <hi>Ieromes</hi> iudgement that Babylom of whom
the Angell preached, that howsoeuer she boasts of her eternity,
<hi>She is fallen, she is fallen, euen Babylon that great city, and neuer shal
rise againe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They crie out against vs, that we raile and speake contumeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
of the holy sea of the Pope, when we cal Rome the whore
of Babylon: but when the old Doctors (to whose iudgement
they themselues appeale from the authoritie of the Scriptures)
feare not so plainely in their writings to paint out the Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall
Strumpet in her right colours, and in flat words to say she
is Rome, the mother of all abhomination, and the sea of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ:
why should we be blamed for saying as we are taught by
them? And especially of those men that make so great vaunts
that the iudgement of the Fathers is altogether on their side by
whom they offer to be tried, when they dare not abide the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Scriptures?</p>
            <p>Againe, consider I pray you; if the old Doctors before Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
were openly reuealed, did vnderstand by the Scriptures
that he should sit at Rome: what thinke you would they haue
said and written if they had liued in these daies, and knowne and
seene all that was prophesied to be fulfilled in him? With what
confidence suppose ye, would they haue inueyed against him?
With how open mouthes would they haue cried out vpon him?
At least wise do you not thinke in your conscience, that when
they had considered the authoritie of the Pope, and his whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
doctrine, they would haue changed their minds, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canted
their writings against Rome, and repented that euer they
had called her the purple whoore of Babylon, seeing she is the
holy mother Church of Rome, the sea of the most holy father
the Pope the head of the same Church?</p>
            <p>I must needs say thus much in your behalfe (ô ye Papists) as
ill as I loue you, that if <hi>Ierome, Tertullian,</hi> and the rest of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
did so account of Rome as you affirme of them, they were
much too blame to defame her with such odious names, as to
call her the whoore of Babylon, which must needs make her ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:14859:187"/>
suspected to be the Church of Antichrist, and not of
Christ: for what Papist in these dayes dare say, that which <hi>Ierom</hi>
said, that Rome is that purple Harlot Babylon, which S. <hi>Iohn</hi>
speaketh of in the Apocalypse? The same <hi>Ierome</hi> in his 13. booke
of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentaries of the Prophecie of <hi>Esay,</hi> vpon the 47. chapter
writeth in this maner: <hi>Licet ex eo quod iuxta 70. scriptu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> est</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>id est, filia Babylonis, non ipsam Babylone<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> quidam, sed
Romana<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vrbem interpretantur, quae in Apocalypsi Iohannis &amp; Epist.
Petri Babylo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> specialiter appellatur, &amp;c.</hi> That is to say: For as much
as the seuentie Interpreters write, not the daughter Babylon, but
the daughter of Babylon, some do interpret thereof, not Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon
in Caldea, but the citie of Rome, which in the Reuelation
of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and the Epistle of <hi>Peter,</hi> is specially called Babylon.
Note that <hi>Ierome</hi> in this place accounted Rome to be Babylon
the younger, daughter of Babylon the elder. And secondly, that
this was not his opinion onely, but the consent of many other
in his time, and namely, of such as vsed to interpret the Prophet
<hi>Esay.</hi> Thirdly and especially consider, that he affirmeth Rome
in the Apocalypse to be especially called Babylon. So that Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon
in the Apocalypse, by his iudgement, can be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
for nothing else but Rome, because Rome is there spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
figured by Babylon. What meaneth <hi>Ierome</hi> so often to
beate in this naile, that Babylon is Rome? If it had slipped out
of his pen but once, he might haue bene pardoned for his ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight:
but when he hath neuer done writing, that Rome is Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,
why should we account him any longer for a Catholike?</p>
            <p>For in his Preface vnto the booke of <hi>Didimus, De Spiritu
sancto,</hi> which he translated out of Greeke into Latine, writing
to <hi>Paulinianus,</hi> he vttereth these words: <hi>Cùm in Babylone versa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
&amp; purpuratae Meretricis essem Colonus, &amp; iure Quiritum
viuerem, &amp;c.</hi> Of late (saith he) when I was in Babylon, and was
an inhabitant of the purple Harlot, and liued after the lawes of
the Romaines, I thought to intreat somwhat of the holy Ghost.
What needed <hi>Ierome</hi> in this place so odiously and contumeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
to call Rome by the name of Babylon, but that he could
neuer consider Rome otherwise, but to be the See appointed
for Antichrist? For in other places where he interpreteth the
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:14859:188"/>
Scriptures and Prophecies, concerning Antichrist, we may lesse
maruell if he interpret Babylon for Rome, because no reason
could leade him to expound it otherwise. But here talking plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly
with his friend, what necessitie compelled him to vse such
descriptions of Rome, but that this perswasion was so deepely
grauen in his mind, that Babylon is Rome, that neither in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
nor iest he could forget it, but is alwaies harping vpon it, as
though he thought scorne to call Rome by any other name, then
that he had learned in the Scriptures to be Babylon, and the
purple harlot? For in like maner writing to <hi>Marcella,</hi> a vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Gentlewoman of Rome, whome he allured to forsake
Rome, and to dwell neare vnto him in Bethelem, one speciall
reason that he vseth to perswade her, is this: That as Bethelem
whither he wold haue her to repaire, is situate in the holy Land,
and the place consecrated to the birth of CHRIST: so Rome
where she desired to remaine, was the Babylonicall harlot, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Reuelation of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> appointed for the birth of
Antichrist, which there should arise, and exercise his tyrannie,
and from thence should deceiue the whole world with his wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
wiles.</p>
            <p>But who so will reade the workes of <hi>Ierome,</hi> may find yet
more places, in which he is bold to call Rome Babylon, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
See of Antichrist. Whereby it is apparant, that it is no new or
strange matter to seeke Antichrist at Rome, when such old Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
of the Church, so commonly in Commentaries, Epistles,
and other writings, do teach vs that Rome is Babylon: and the
Scripture affirmeth that Babylon is the See of Antichrist. But
let vs leaue S. <hi>Ierome,</hi> and see what other say of the same matter.</p>
            <p>S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> writing a Commentarie vpon the Reuelation
of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> is of the same iudgement. Of the authoritie of the
worke I wil moue no question at this time, seeing it is commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to vs by <hi>Cuthbert Tonstall,</hi> late bishop of Duresme, who
found it in an old Librarie, and first set it in print, vnder the
name of that great S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> and is willing that men should
so thinke of it. It is good authoritie I say, against the Papists, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
commended by so Catholike a Prelate, and because they
are wont to receiue whatsoeuer cometh vnder the name of an
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:14859:188"/>
old Doctor, though it be neuer so vnlike his writing, and crie
out vpon vs for reiecting at our pleasure the workes of auncient
Doctors, that make against our doctrine: as though we reiected
any without cause, or they refused none for any cause: whereas
<hi>Pigius</hi> their great Patron, blushed not to reiect the report of two
generall Councels, the fift and sixt of Constantinople, which are
commended to vs by publike faith of the Church of Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,
because in the one Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> is condemned and
accursed for an heretike, and in neither of both the Popes Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates
could haue the highest place, according to the request of
their ambitious Maister. But as for this <hi>Ambrose,</hi> if he were not
<hi>Ambrose</hi> of Millaine, yet is it apparant by the stile, that he was
some auncient Writer of the Latine Church, and he through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this Prophecie interpreteth Babylon to be Rome, and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
to be sought no where but at Rome. <hi>Primasius</hi> also a very
auncient Writer, who likewise commenteth vpon the Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypse,
expoundeth these Prophecies of Antichrist to be fulfilled
in the Romaine Empire, and of the citie of Rome.</p>
            <p>S. <hi>Augustine</hi> in his learned worke <hi>De Ciuitate Dei,</hi> not once
or twice, but oftentimes is bold to call Rome Babylon, and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon
Rome, as in his sixteenth booke and seuenth chapter, he
calleth Rome another Babylon in the West. And in his eighth
booke and second chapter, he calleth Babylon of Caldea the
first Rome; and Rome of Italie the second Babylon: willing
men to consider, that in the beginning of the citie of God,
which was the Church in <hi>Abrahams</hi> time, the first Rome, that
was Easterne Babylon her enemie, was builded in Caldea, and
about the same time that the first Babylon was destroyed, lest
the citie of God should lacke her enemie, the second Babylon,
which is Rome in Italie was erected. It is a strange matter, that
the same citie which is the professed enemie of the citie of God,
should be the mother of all religion, and the very citie of God
it selfe. O <hi>Augustine,</hi> thou wast not well aduised to make the
Citie of Rome enemie to the Citie of GOD, that Rome shold
be the same to the Church of GOD, that Babylon of old was
to Ierusalem! The same <hi>Augustine</hi> in the 22. Chapter of the 18.
booke, calleth Rome another Babylon, and daughter of the first
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:14859:189"/>
Babylon. And in the 27. Chapter he calleth Rome westerne Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon.
By these &amp; other testimonies of old Writers that might
be brought but for tediousnesse, I suppose it is sufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
that Babylon in this my text spoken of, is Rome, and that
we should not seek Antichrist to proceed from any other place
then from Rome. But what need I trouble my selfe to seeke fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
testimoniall, for confirmation of this matter, that Babylon
is Rome, then of the Papists themselues? which affirme that S.
<hi>Peter</hi> in his Epistle, where he sendeth salutations fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Church
gathered in Babylon, by Babylon vnderstandeth Rome. And
they learne it of <hi>Ieronime,</hi> which in the life of S. <hi>Marke</hi> doth so
expound it. So greedie they are to find a place in Scripture,
where <hi>Peter</hi> should be said to haue bene at Rome, that they are
content to acknowledge Babylon in the Scripture to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
of Rome. And thus I haue performed, I trust sufficiently,
that which I tooke in hand to proue, both by the authoritie of
holy Scripture in plaine and manifest texts, and by consent of
many auncient writers, yea by the confession of the Papists the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
that Babylon in the Scripture is taken for Rome. And
thus much for the first part, in which, because I haue bene ouer
long, I will be shorter in that which remaineth.</p>
            <p>In the second part I promised to declare how Babylon
which is Rome is fallen, according to the Prophecie of this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell:
<hi>She is fallen,</hi> saith the Angell, <hi>She is fallen.</hi> He repeateth
the word of falling for two causes: first, to declare the certainty
of her decay, that howsoeuer she seemed to flourish &amp; triumph,
as though she should neuer haue fallen or come to ruine: yet
God for her wickednesse most righteously, and for the comfort
of his Church most mercifully, had decreed vndoubtedly that
she should fall, when that time was once come, which in his
most wise and well ordered counsell was appointed for her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.
Secondly, he repeateth twice, that she is fallen, to
shew, that she should haue an vnrecouerable fall: she should
not fall as other Cities, which haue risen againe: but she should
fall without all hope of recouerie, neuer to be restored againe.
Therefore in the eighteenth Chapter, a mightie Angell taketh
vp a great Mil-stone, and throweth it into the sea, saying: <hi>With
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:14859:189"/>
such violence shall Babylon that great Citie be throwne downe, and
neuer be seene any more.</hi> So that as it is impossible for a great Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone,
throwne with great force by a mightie Angell into the
bottome of the sea, to rise vp againe and swim aboue the water:
so impossible is it that Babylon, when she is at the lowest of her
fall, should euer be set vp againe. And in the nineteenth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
it is said: <hi>That the smoake of her burning ascended vp for euer
and euer.</hi> Also of her vtter desolation, descriptions are made in
the eighteenth Chapter, where it is said, that Babylon is made
a dwelling place of diuels, a cage of vncleane birds: according
to the Prophecie of <hi>Esay</hi> concerning old Babylon, that <hi>Zyim</hi> &amp;
<hi>Ohym,</hi> which be Sprights and Goblins shall walke in her Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces,
Scrichowles and Ostriges shall crie in her houses, Apes
and Satyres shall daunce in her beautifull buildings. No voice of
men shall be heard in her, no sound of a Mill shall be heard, no
light of a candle shall be seene, but perpetuall solitude and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
shall dwell there for euermore. Therefore saith the Angell,
<hi>she is fallen, she is fallen,</hi> that is, she is destroyed, and neuer shall
be repaired.</p>
            <p>But if we will better vnderstand how she is fallen, we must
consider more distinctly wherein she is fallen. First, in wealth
and riches she hath sustained a great fall. Consider how many
kingdomes and states of the world haue renounced her obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and all those haue withdrawne great rents, reuenues, and
commodities, that in times past were addicted to the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of Babylon, the Church of Rome: A great fall without
peraduenture, and that will neuer be recouered. Remember so
many Abbeyes, Monasteries, Nunneries, Frieries, Hospitals,
Chauntries, Churches and Chappels, now ouerthrowne and
made euen with the ground. All lands, iewels, ornaments and
great treasures that belonged vnto them, cleane taken away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
them: and you will confesse with me, that Rome in riches hath a
great fall. Yea, if you would see with your eyes a manifest exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Gods iudgement against Babylon, behold those euill fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured
ruines and heapes of Monasteries, that were sometimes
gorgeous and sumptuous buildings. The same end remaineth
all that pompe and pride of Babylon not yet altogether beaten
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:14859:190"/>
downe, but euen now in falling. For the mouth of the Lord hath
spoken it, and his immutable counsell hath decreed it, and he
hath sent an Angell to proclaime it.</p>
            <p>Some wish perchance, that Monasteries had stood still, and
bene conuerted to better vses: but vndoubtedly the prouidence
of God so ordered all things, that his curse which was vpon
them might be executed, and the Prophecies that were concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
them, might be fulfilled, that they might be a monument
of his wrath vnto all the posteritie, the beginning of the fall of
Babylon, and an example of the destruction of all the rest, that
should follow soone after. Who would euer haue thought that
so great riches, treasures and reuenues should so suddenly be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowne,
destroyed, and come to nothing? Therefore it is
manifest, that the wealth and worldly substance, whereby the
pride, voluptuousnesse, and intemperance of ryotous Rome was
maintained, and growne to an intollerable excesse, is greatly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minished,
sore decayed, and hath a foule fall, and shortly shall
haue a finall fall.</p>
            <p>Well, Babylon is not fallen onely in wealth and riches, but
also in power and authoritie. For the kings of the earth which
sometimes were subiect to that monstrous beast, haue now sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
off the yoke of her seruitude, and withdrawne the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of all their subiects from her. Yea, the most part of the ten
hornes, which sometime gaue ouer their power and authoritie
vnto the beast, which were all the Kings and Potentates that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
the Pope for their supreme head, and soueraigne
Lord, do now hate and abhorre the Harlot of Rome, and shall
make her desolate by withdrawing their Subiects from her obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
and naked by spoiling her of her treasures, and shall
eate her flesh for pure hatred, and burne her with fire: <hi>For great
is the Lord which iudgeth her.</hi> So that she which before at her
pleasure might commaund all Princes to begin warre, to cease
from warre, to defend her quarrels, to annoy her enemies, now
is glad to flatter a few seduced Princes to take her part, that she
be not vtterly forsaken of all men: or else to practise by treason
and trecherie, suborning Rogues and Vagabonds to stirre vp tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults
among the rude people, to trouble godly estates and
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:14859:190"/>
commonwealths that despise her dominion; but without all
hope euer to recouer her auncient tyrannie.</p>
            <p>Her thunderbolts of Excommunication, which were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
terrible to all men, are now feared of no man. What thogh
she retaine her proud and presumptuous stomacke, and will do
while her breath lasteth, to pronounce sentence of depriuation
against Princes that abhorre her wickednesse? Her impudent
arrogancie is not so much detested of many, as laughed to scorn
of all. Her Proctors and priuie practisers, though they chaunge
themselues like <hi>Proteus,</hi> into neuer so vnlikely shapes, are espi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in euery corner. For God himselfe reuealeth their pretences,
and will not suffer her to preuaile any longer. So that in power
and authoritie Babylon is fallen, and falleth daily more and
more into vtter contempt with all men, vntill she be vtterly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
and brought to nothing, which will not be long before
it come to passe. For this sentence that God hath pronounced
against her, and begun also to execute, cannot be chaunged, or
much longer deferred.</p>
            <p>But especially and chiefly Babylon is fallen in credite of her
doctrine. For besides so many Princes and estates of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
that by publike authoritie haue receiued the Gospell, and
vtterly abolished all Babylonicall doctrine: euen in the midst of
her tyrannie and persecution, great multitudes daily are lighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with the bright beames of the Gospell: that for all Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
imprisonments, exquisite torments, and cruell burnings,
they neuer a whit diminish, but rather increase, as God hath
prouided that the bloud of the Martyrs should be the seed of
the Church. And they are more then obstinate, if they do not
acknowledge that this matter is gouerned from God aboue.
For if it had bene of men, it must needes haue decayed before
this time, and haue come to nought, as <hi>Gamaliel</hi> said of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Apostles. Therefore in fighting against it, they
shew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues but after the maner of the old Gyants, to make
warre against God. Or as it is contained in this Prophecie,
that Antichrist should gather together the Princes of the earth
to make battell against him that sitteth vpon the white Horse,
whose name is <hi>The word of God,</hi> but all to their vtter confusion
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:14859:191"/>
and destruction. For the word of God must conquer and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
in the last age, and Antichrist must be consumed by the
spirit of the mouth of Christ, which is his holy word, and vtterly
abolished by the glorious brightnesse of his coming to iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as <hi>S. Paule</hi> testifieth in the second Chapter of the second
Epistle to the Thessalonians. Therfore it is vaine that they seeke
to vnderprop the doctrine of Babylon by crueltie and tyrannie,
for all will not serue, seeing the time of her final fall approcheth,
and now already our Sauiour Christ with the spirit of his mouth
hath wasted and consumed a great part of that credit &amp; estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in which the doctrine of Babylon of long time hath trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed.
And it is our parts to pray that her credit may dayly more
and more decrease, that the kingdom of Christ may be perfectly
established amongst vs, and the kingdom of Antichrist over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne,
euen from the foundations, that no superfluous relicks
of Babylonical religion may remain where the church of Christ
is in building, but that the doctrin of Babylo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may fal altogether.</p>
            <p>Thus I haue declared that Baylon in wealth and substance,
in power and authoritie, in credit &amp; estimation of her doctrine,
is falne, and that without hope of recouery: for her credit is crac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
not onely amongst her enemies the Protestants, but euen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
her best friends and greatest Arch-papists. For I suppose
there is none in the world so blind, so superstitious, so deuoutly
addict in all points of Popish idolatrie and superstition, as they
were 30. or 40. yeares past. Although they close their eyes neuer
so obstinatly against the light of Gods word, yet some effect of
the beames of force wil pierce euen through their eye-lids. And
that they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues cannot dissemble, although they would neuer
so faine, but that they haue bene deceiued with grosse errors and
shameful superstitions: their pardons, their pilgrimages, their le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gends:
who is now so blind that seeth not how the world hath
bin seduced by them? And the simplicitie of the people abused
to satisfie their vnsatiable couetousnesse?</p>
            <p>As for the greatest Patrons of Poperie that be learned, they
cannot denie, but that great errors haue bene receiued and
taught for truth. Yea the Pope himselfe hath acknowledged,
that many errours haue crept into the church, yea euen into the
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:14859:191"/>
Masse: but the reformation of them pertaineth to him alone
and the generall Councell. But what hope of reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is to be
looked for at their hands, let it be seene in the decrees of the last
Councell of Trent. What litle Mise those great mountaines in
so many yeares trauell haue brought foorth? In fortie or fiftie
yeares consultation two great matters reformed. One for Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doners
not to be common pedlers, another for the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in both kinds, to those that desire it, so they confesse it were
as good in one kind, and agree with them in all other points of
Poperie. Yet all was not well, they confesse by their correction.
And as for the greatest Pillars and Proctors they haue, if they
be pressed neare, acknowledge a great deale more. As one that
landed lately at Yarmouth, before witnesse of good credit testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
that if he might be satisfied in two points, concerning the
Popes supremacie, and the reall presence, for other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
he would not greatly striue. So that I will conclude, that
Babylon is fallen in riches, in power, in credit of Doctrine, not
onely with Protestants, but euen with Papists themselues.</p>
            <p>But now I know what will be obiected against me, That I
haue trauelled all in vaine, to proue that Babylon is fallen, and
that Babylon is Rome: and that I haue abused the texts of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
and sentences of old Doctors, to proue the same. For
whatsoeuer is contained either in the Scripture, or in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of the auncient Doctors, to proue that Babylon is Rome,
is to be vnderstood of Rome vnder the heathen Emperours, and
not vnder the Popes: and that all this while I haue wrested the
Scriptures, and enforced the Doctors to affirme that which they
neuer thought of. Indeed I will confesse that some Prophesies
contained in this Reuelation, were fulfilled in the heathen Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours,
and that the heathen Empire was an introduction vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Antichrist: but that Antichrist the great enemie of the church
of Christ, and which is principally called Antichrist, could not
be any of the heathen Monarchie, I will make it manifest by
plaine demonstrations. And first I will retaine this Principle
sufficiently proued before, that Rome is the See of Antichrist,
and that by authoritie of Scriptures, and consent of auncient
Writers we can seeke him no where but in the Romaine Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:14859:192"/>
And now the controuersie resteth in this, whether the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Emperors or the Pope be he.</p>
            <p>First, S. <hi>Paul</hi> in the second chapter of the second Epistle to
the Thessalonians, speaking purposely of Antichrist, saith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly,
that he shall sit in the Temple of God, which is the
Church of Christ. But it is manifest that the heathen Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
did not sit in the Church of God, therefore the
heathen Emperour is not this Antichrist. And by the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
it is manifest, that <hi>Mahomet</hi> is not that especiall Antichrist,
because he sitteth without the temple of God, as there be diuers
that would haue these things to be vnderstood of <hi>Mahomet</hi> or
<hi>Ottomanus:</hi> but it is as cleare as the Sunne at noone dayes; for as
much as neither the heathen Emperors, nor <hi>Mahomet,</hi> nor <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomanus</hi>
sitteth in the Temple or Church of God, that none of
them is that great Antichrist, of whom the prophesies of the
Scripture are to be expounded.</p>
            <p>And whereas some of them interprete the abhomination of
desolation where of Christ speaketh, to be meant of Antichrist,
or at leastwise to be a signe of him, that cannot be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
of the heathen Emperours, or any other that is without
the Church: for that standeth in the holy place which is
the temple, and signifieth the Church. Now the Pope sitteth in
the midst of the temple of God, and boasteth himself to be God,
chalenging to himselfe such authoritie as is proper only to God,
and vsurping such honour as is peculiar onely to God. Therfore
not in the heathen Emperors, but in the Popes is this prophesie
accomplished.</p>
            <p>Another reason to proue that Antichrist (which in this Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
is foreshewed to come into the world) cannot be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
to be the heathen Emperours, is taken out of the seuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
chapter of the same booke: for there the Angell interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to S. <hi>Iohn</hi> the mysterie of the beast that beareth the harlot,
which hath seuen heads, signifying seuen hilles, he declareth also
that they signifie seuen Kings, or principall estates, or formes of
regiment, for so the name of King is often taken in the Prophets
and specially in <hi>Daniel,</hi> at which prophesie S. <hi>Iohn</hi> borroweth
many phrases. Of these seuen heads, fiue (he saith) were fallen,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:14859:192"/>
the sixt was then presently in authority, and the seuenth was not
yet come, which seuenth was the monstrous beast Antichrist,
that was both the seuenth and the eight. Now it is euident, that
this could not be vnderstood of the heathen Emperours: for
<hi>Nero</hi> the first persecuting Paynim was come and gone, and <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitian</hi>
another persecutor, (by whose tyrannie S. <hi>Iohn</hi> was bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
into the Ile of Pathmos, where he saw and receiued this
Reuelation) was then in authoritie: so that of the Monarchie or
tyrannie of heathen Emperours, this could not be vnderstood,
and of the Christian Emperours, no man will expound it: so that
it must needs be turned ouer to the Pope, for it can rest in no
place else: and being referred vnto him, all the rest haue a very
apt exposition.</p>
            <p>For the citie of Rome, and the dominions thereof, hath had
seuen principall states or formes of regiment: the first state of
Kings, the second of Consuls, the third of Decemviri, the fourth
of Dictators, the fift of Triumviri, the sixt of Caesars or Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
and the seuenth of Popes. Now fiue of these states or formes
of regiment were fallen and abolished in Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> time; the
sixt which was the Emperours, in his time was in place, and the
seuenth which is the Popes, was not yet come, which was the
very beast it selfe: the Romaine Empire reuiued and raised vp
from the bottomlesse pit of hell, into the vsurped tyrannie of the
Pope. And this is that beast, that sometimes was of wonderfull
great power and glory in the dayes of <hi>Augustus,</hi> and some other
of his successors, but then much decayed, as if it had not bene, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
in some sort it were, but should be restored in the vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
authoritie of the Pope, that claimeth all the world to be his
Diocesse: which power commeth not from God, but from the
Prince of pride, out of the bottomlesse pit. But chiefly let vs
consider, that the beast although he be but one, yet in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
he standeth for two, for he is that seuenth head, and the
eight also. And remember that the Pope challengeth double
authoritie, namely the power of both the swords, the spirituall
and temporall. So that in this exposition all things agree most
aptly.</p>
            <p>Againe, it is manifest in the Scriptures, that Antichrist should
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:14859:193"/>
deceiue the world with false doctrine, vnder pretence and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of true religion, and therefore so often times the Scripture
warneth men, that they be not seduced by him: which were
needles, if any ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> professed enemy of Christ shold be that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist.
For there is no likelihood that an heathen man, a Iew or
a Turk should deceiue any multitude of true Christians: but he
that vnder the pretence of the name of Christ, seeketh most of
all to deface the honour of Christ, he is a subtle aduersarie, and
the very spirit of Antichrist, as S. <hi>Iohn</hi> also in his Epistle doth te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie.
For in the second chapter speaking of those Antichrists,
which were the fore-runners of the great Antichrist, he sheweth
that they went out from the Church. And in the fourth chapter
he calleth them false Prophets, and teacheth men how to know
the spirit of Antichrist, <hi>He that denieth Iesus to be Christ, he that
denieth that Iesus Christ is come in the flesh:</hi> that is, he that deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
any thing from the honour of Iesus to be Christ, and in his
flesh to haue performed the ful worke of mans redemption, as
the Pope doth most blasphemously, he is Antichrist: and who so
teacheth any such doctrine, speaketh by the spirit of Antichrist.
For the testimony of Iesus is the spirit of prophesie. Seeing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that S. <hi>Iohn</hi> accounteth Antichrist for one that is gone from
the church, &amp; for a false Prophet, it is cleare that Antichrist is no
heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Emperor, which was neuer of the Church, nor yet a false
Prophet that tooke vpon him to teach in the Church. The same
may be said of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who neuer professed himselfe to be a
Christian, nor yet a Prophet in the Church of Christ, pretending
to vphold the religion of Christ, but an open enemie of the
Gospel, &amp; of our Sauior Christ, altogether without the Church.
By these arguments I doubt not but all men may see, that seeing
Babylon is Rome, and that the head of Babylon is Antichrist,
that he cannot be any of the heathen Emperours, but euen the
Pope himselfe. And therefore I conclude according to my text,
that Rome is fallen, if Babylon be fallen.</p>
            <p>Now remaineth the last part that I promised to intreate of,
namely the cause of Gods so seuere iudgment against Babylon,
that he hath decreed her vtter ouerthrow and destruction, which
the Angel comprehendeth in these words, <hi>Because she hath made
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:14859:193"/>
all nations drunke with the wine of the furie of her fornication:</hi> that
is, she hath deceiued all the world with false doctrine, which he
compareth vnto two kinds of vices, whereby men are so decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
that they loose all their right iudgement, drunkennesse and
fornication: for as these two vices do allure men to commit
them, by coueting of vaine delectation that is in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; euen so Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon
hath inticed all men like another <hi>Circe,</hi> to drink of the cup
of her delectable errours, and to commit most filthy fornication
with her idolatrous religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For of al other religions, to the carnal
man none is so pleasant as Poperie is, in which be so many kinds
of satisfaction to be obtained, both in this life and after men be
dead, that there is no greater securitie for an hypocrite to sleepe
in, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the faire promises of Popery. And that causeth so many
willingly to embrace it, and so loth to depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, because they
would still continue without checke of true doctrine, which cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
men to repentance, &amp; amendment of life, or else threatneth
eternall damnation. For howsoeuer it pleaseth them to charge
the doctrine of the Gospell with cause of securitie, it may easily
be seene by comparison of it with the doctrine of Poperie, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is cause of securitie: that which teacheth no satisfaction but
one, for them that be penitent in this life: or theirs that hath so
many wayes to merit rewards, and to satisfie for sinnes, not only
while men liue in the world, but also for them that are already
gone out of it. And there is no wine so sweet to the tast of a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
man, as that which maketh him drunke with opinion of his
owne righteousnesse: as it is the nature of strong wine, to make
very cowards thinke themselues to be valiant champions: and
such is the cup of popish doctrine, containing merits and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions.</p>
            <p>Againe, when we consider that Antichrist should make men
drunke with his erronious doctrine, we maruell lesse how men
could be so blinded and infatuate, that they could not see and
perceiue such grosse errors and manifest vntruths as are in Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.
For as they that are ouercome with the strength of wine, haue
lost the right vse both of their wit and of their senses: euen so
they that are drunke with the hereticall doctrine of Papistrie, do
grope in the cleare light of the Sunne, and see not their owne
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:14859:194"/>
deformitie, though all the world beside crie out of them. In like
maner, they that be ouercome with the vnhonest loue of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots,
they haue their reason so imprisoned in corrupt affection
and foolish fantasie, that they are at libertie neither to see their
owne folly, nor to admit any wise and godly counsell. So it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
with those that the Babylonical <hi>Circe</hi> the Church of Rome
hath allured by her inchauntments, to commit spirituall forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
with her, they cannot abide to heare the voice of them
that call them out of that damnable estate, so highly they please
themselues in their owne misery, as if they were in case of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
felicitie. This is the effect of their drunkennesse, this is the
effect of their fornication, and this is the iust iudgement of God,
that they which haue shut vp their eares from hearing the truth,
should be deceiued with strong delusions, that they might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
lies. Furthermore, by the names of these vices, the Angell
comprehendeth all other vices that follow drunkennesse and
incontinencie. For these crimes go not vnaccompanied, for
where either of them is, commonly both will be, and they haue
either of them, and both together, their traine to waite vpon
them: and all these we see to haue ouerflowed in Rome the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterne
Babylon, as she her selfe, though she haue a brazen fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
and be past all shame, cannot denie altogether. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of these so great and hainous inormities, the iust sentence
of God pronounced here by the Angell, is come vpon her, that
she is now in her fall and decay, as she was once in her ruffe
and glorie. But this especially is to be noted, that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
here saith, that <hi>she should deceiue all nations with the furie
of her fornication.</hi> For this is the great vniuersalitie that they
make so great bragges of, and would haue it to be a certaine
note and marke of the Catholicke Church to be vniuersall.
Behold the Angell sayth here in plaine words, that all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
should drinke of the wine of the furie of her fornication:
Where is then the vniuersall consent and vnitie of all nations
in Religion, that maketh a true Religion? and yet vniuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
and vnitie be two great pillars of the Church of Rome.
And for my part, I do not enuie her those markes which she
challengeth of vniuersalitie and vnitie (although we might
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:14859:194"/>
stand in law with her for them,) but let her peaceably inioy
them: for they may helpe to proue her to be the false Church
of Antichrist, but they cannot make her to be the true Church
of Christ. We see plainely that Babylon hath here vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salitie
and vnitie, for she maketh all nations to drinke of the
furious wine of her fornication: but the Church of Christ (as
he himselfe sayth) is a small flocke; and himselfe by <hi>Simeon</hi> is
said to be a signe of contradiction, a marke that is gaine-said of
most men.</p>
            <p>And here also is answered one great mightie obiection,
wherewith they thinke to choke vs: That seeing the Church
of Christ is the Spouse of Christ, how could it be that Christ
should forsake his Spouse, and suffer her to continue in dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
errours so many hundred yeares? Why, Christ himselfe
declareth, that the deceipts and errours of false Prophets
should be so great, that if it were possible the very elect should
be deceiued: yea, there should be such a miserable dispersion,
that scarce two true professors of his name should remaine
together in one place, and yet the holy band of vnitie should
be in the head, which is our Sauiour Christ: for whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
the carcasse is, thither the Eagles would be gathered.
And Saint <hi>Paule</hi> in manifest words declareth, that the second
comming of Christ should not be before there were a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
apostacie, that is, a departure from the true faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
of Christ, and that the sonne of perdition Antichrist
were openly shewed. And in this Reuelation how often is it
said, that Antichrist should deceiue all the world, all nations,
people and tongues, and that the Church of Christ should
be driuen into the wildernesse, out of the sight of the world,
and there remaine a space, vntill she should be brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
to light and open knowledge of all men? As it is
come to passe this day, Gods name be therefore euerlastingly
praised.</p>
            <p>But because I haue occupied long time, I will draw to an
end: for by that I haue said, I trust it doth sufficiently appere,
that God according to his righteous iudgement, hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
vtterly to ouerthrow Babylon, because she hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:14859:195"/>
all nations with the wine of the furie of her fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And now it resteth onely that I speake a word or two
of the voice of the third Angell, which is a consequent of
this my text, and serueth very aptly for the conclusion of my
Sermon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The third Angell followed, crying with a loud voyce, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi>
If any man shall worship the Beast, or his image, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
his marke en his forehead, or in his hand; or shall acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
any obedience or reuerence to him, as willing to drinke
of the cup of Babylons fornication, the same shall drinke of the
wine of the furie of Gods wrath, which is powred foorth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled
into the great cuppe of Gods anger, and they shall be
tormented with fire and brimstone, before the Lambe and his
holy Angels, and the smoke of their torments shall ascend for
euermore, and they shall haue no rest day nor night from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame
torments that worship the Beast, or shew any reuerence
vnto Antichrist. <hi>The effect is in few words: that horrible,
intollerable, and eternall torments remaine for all them that
now (especially when Babylon is now discouered) will haue
any thing to doe with her damnable errours and pernicious
doctrine: for howsoeuer ignorance before her fall, though
it were inexcusable, yet seemed to diminish the greatnesse of
the crime; now that her wickednesse is openly displayed,
no pretence can saue men from the extreamitie of Gods
wrath, if they will still obstinately continue in her here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let vs therefore pray vnto Almightie God instantly, that
all men in their vocation may seeke the vtter ouerthrow and
destruction of Babylon: that Princes and Magistrates may
according to the prophecies of them, hate her with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
hatred, and vtterly abolish whatsoeuer belongeth to her:
that they may reward her, as she hath rewarded vs, and
giue her double punishment according to her workes: and
in the cuppe of affliction that she hath powred forth for vs,
they may powre forth double as much to her. And looke
how much she hath glorified her selfe, and liued in wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonnesse,
(which was without measure) so much they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:14859:195"/>
vpon her of sorrow and torments. That Preachers and
Ministers of Gods word may plainely and without dissimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
or halting, discouer her wickednesse, and earnestly to
vrge whatsoeuer hath yet need of perfect reformation. That
all subiects may continue in holy obedience, first to God,
and then to their Prince, to the aduauncing of the honour
and glorie of God, through Iesus Christ: to whom with
the holy Ghost be all honor, glory, power
and dominon, both now and
euer. Amen.</p>
