            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

facts are seen, but the minde is not.
Let the good Reader take notice, that in
the conclusion of this Plea, the advocate
saith, <hi>That men have disputed against them</hi>
(the Anabaptists) <hi>with so much weakness
and confidence, that they have been encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
in their errour more by the accidental
advantages we have given them by our weak
arguings, then by any truth of their cause, or
excellency of their wit:</hi> And I conceive that
he will think with me, that it should be a
motive to him, to whom God hath given
more excellency of art and nature to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
the truth which he hath opposed, lest
<pb facs="tcp:31222:9"/>
otherwise he sacrilegiously eclipse Gods
honour, by a kinde of Interposition of that
body which shineth by no other light then
that which God lent. If he that hid his
Masters talent, so that it did neither good
nor harm, yet heard his <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, what
(except in case of timely repentance) may
they expect, who with those many talents
which their Master entrusted to them, have
assisted and furnished the known enemy
with arms against their Master? Consider
what I say, and the Lord give you a right
understanding in all things. Lastly, I have
to entreat the well-affected Reader, not to
misdeem some repetitions of the same
things (in cases of such conflicts unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able)
wherein the adversaries often stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
at the same parts, requires the same
or the like wards for defence of the truth:

you: To him be glory and dominion for ever

of Regeneration to all the elect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is, a powerful influence
on them to regenerate, sanctifie, and finally save them? Doth
God save any Infants? These things being concluded on, I
would fain learn how it can be true, that children have no

Infant express an admirable influence on the bodily faculties,

We answer, 1. <q>They signifie something which is their end;

               </p>
               <p>2. Here is a meer <hi>ignoratio elenchi,</hi> and mistake of the
question in hand, which is not whether Circumcision were a
type and figure of Baptisme, but whether Baptisme so suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
Circumcision, as a Seal of the <hi>Righteousnesse of Faith.</hi>
That such sorts of persons (to wit, young and old) within
the covenants, as had right to the one, have the like right to
the other, which we affirm.</p>
               <p>3. Where you say, <hi>Vnless a Commandment go along with
them, &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> First, we say, that where the question is mistaken, we
are not in reason bound to answer untill it be rightly stated,

Secondly, concerning a command for baptizing, you
doubt not, nor we for baptizing of Infants; seeing that where
the Reason and Equity of the Law remains, there the Law,
for substance, is still in force, though not for every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance:
Now nothing can reasonably be alledged, why chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

                  <hi>Seal of the Righteousness of Faith,</hi> then they were who lived
under the Law? But you say further,
<q>—Supposing a correspondence of Analogie between Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision

to seal up the admitted to faith, repentance, mortification,

               <p>Concerning a Character or impress set upon the baptized,

action, or passion? And if a quality, of what kind it is?
Whether the subject thereof be the soul, or some active or

Whether the Sacraments of the old Testament made the like
impress? &amp;c. In all which, and the like vain speculations,
we may not unprofitably note the just judgment of God, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them over to unfruitfull delusions, who forsaking the
true and constant light of his holy word, give themselves o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

you are not of their sense, though you mention this impress.

the circumstances of sex, age, and a fixed day, are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressly

3. Though women were not capable of circumcision, and
therefore it was not enjoyned them, yet the female is as ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable

agreeing in substance, did yet differ in many circumstances.
First, in the Rite or Ceremony. Secondly, in the manner of
signifying: For Circumcision held out grace in the
<hi>Messias</hi> then to come; but baptism presenteth it in Christ
exhibited. Thirdly, in the particular testimony annexed to

If you mean by <hi>Spirituall Infants,</hi> such as are born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
of water and the holy Ghost, then you would have
them twice regenerate or born: If you mean <hi>Believers</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
(for in reason you cannot call an unbeliever or wicked
person a spirituall infant) then I would fain learn by what
discerning spirit you can know when, and whom to baptize,
and whom to put by; or which infant, according to the
flesh, is not a spiritual infant, by the spirit of regeneration: If
you say that those who are of years, profess faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and therefore are to be baptized, it is easily rejoined;
what ere they professe, they may be hypocrites, and then no
more spirituall Infants then <hi>Iudas</hi> or <hi>Simon Magus</hi> were. If
you say that in charity you take them for spirituall: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
That an opinion that may be so easily false, and in
which any man without speciall revelation may be deceived,
is a very unproportionable ground of so sharp a controversie,
as causeth your Clients to forsake the Church of Christ.
Next, I say, had you but as much charity towards infants,
whom no actuall sins have yet stained, you would as freely
judge them spirituall infants, and so, by your own Principle,
to be baptized, as those of years, of whom possibly you may
know much evill, without all controversie they have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
sins to be repented of; and why should you not afford
harmless Infants who cannot dissemble, as much cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity

I say all, who by him are regenerate to God, infants and

Divine authority, although that which the universal Church

we may truly apprehend of what value the Sacrament of

Doth not Gods blessing give both end and means that we

such is the Kingdom of Heaven?</hi> Surely if Christ adjudge
and give the Kingdom of heaven (which himself onely can
give, and in which none but the elect shall be) to an infant,
it must be no less then impious in man, to abridge, abjudge,
and bar him of admission into the visible Church of Christ
by baptism, which sinfull and ignorant man can administer,

that, as they were condemnable for that they did not in

which Christ, not they, did freely without the works of the

of our justification, <hi>Rom. 5. 1. Rom.</hi> 8. 15, 16. So that the
sum is, that the outward sign, the water and washing of the
body in baptism, is not sufficient to salvation, if the Spirit of
<hi>Iesus</hi> give not the inward effect thereof; and therefore it is
dangerous to live securely in sin and unbelief, as too many

4 We adhere not so to tradition, that we universally receive
all that which was done or said of old: things delivered by
some, but not generally received by the Church, we esteem
but superstructions of particular men, or superseminations,
which possibly may spread farre, as many pernicious opinions
have done; yet no sober man ever took them for <hi>Apostolicall,</hi>
or so much as <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> traditions: we neither reject
any tradition which appeareth to be <hi>Apostolicall</hi> (if not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to their times, or suited peculiarly to certain times,
places, or persons nor do we rashly receive any tradition for
such, except we are certain that the Scripture determineth
nothing against it, or where strong consequence from thence
justifieth it. 5 We conceive <hi>Augustines</hi> rule herein to be
good: <hi>In those things (saith he) concerning which divine Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture

that the calm of charity be not clouded by the storm of
contention. 6 We will not rashly dissent from reverend

antiquity, wherein it dissenteth not from the truth: we love
peace with all who hold that in fundamentalls at least, and
therefore will follow <hi>Augustin's</hi> advice, in that he piously

               <p>This is a promise that concerneth them, as they are reasonable

               </p>

herein:<note place="margin">Acts 2. 38, 39.</note> and so the promise which <hi>S. Peter</hi> there mentioneth,

it not; neither alwayes; as in unbelief, impenitency, or out
of the covenant, as infants of unbelieving parents: it is not
their reason, but Gods covenant which gives them interest in
the promise of salvation and all things thereto subordinate
and belonging. Note here, to what unreasonable conclusions
willfull errour will lead men at last: what more perverse,
then in the prosecution of their dislike to infant-baptisme,<note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Cobbet</hi> explicat. Luke 18. 15. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

and how then is it pertinent to our present question?
You say, that God by that miracle, <hi>did give testimony, that
the persons of the men were in great disposition to heaven, and
therefore were to be admitted to those rites, which are the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary

disposition to heaven</hi> whom Christ blessed, and proposed for
paterns to all that shall enter therein? But we answer,
1. That the great disposition which you talk of, was not so
much the gift of miracles, as the persons inward baptism by
the spirit of regeneration and sanctification: for the gift of
miracles is not of it self, any certain argument of salvation:

We say that by your present confession, such sponsion by
God-fathers is but a circumstance; therefore the sponsors
supply not any incapacity of infants in the respect of the
substance of baptism, which is to be sprinkled, washed
with, or dipped in water, in the name of the Father, the
Son, and the holy Ghost: for this their own capacity is
sufficient (they being born of believing parents, and within
the Church) without the supply of any answer of others
for them; which if you grant us, we have the end of our
dispute; as for circumstances, neither commanded nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden

submit to the authority and practice of the Church in which
we live: If you dispute from the circumstance, or any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended

               <p>We answer 1. In that you can find no authority or
ground for it, nor against it, as we know it can be no other
then <hi>adiaphorous,</hi> or indifferent, and in or for such things

but by reason of this likeness, they oftentimes receive the
very names of these things themselves; therefore as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a certain manner, the Sacrament of Christs body is
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:31222:42"/>
the body of Christ; the Sacrament of Christs blood, is the
blood of Christ; so the Sacrament of faith, is faith: Now
to believe, is nothing else but to have faith; and so when
'tis answered that the infant believeth, who hath not yet
the affection of faith; we answer, that the hath faith in
respect of the sacrament of faith; and that he conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
to God, in respect of the sacrament of conversion;
because even that very answer appertaineth unto the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration
of the Sacrament; as the Apostle speaketh of
baptism it self; We are, saith he, <hi>Buried with him by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism

saith, <hi>We are buried</hi>—therefore he called the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
of so great a matter, by no other name then of
the thing it self: So that faith, though it be not yet such
as consisteth in the will of believers, yet the very Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of that faith, makes a (baptized) infant faithfull,
or a believer: For as 'tis answered that he believeth, so
is he called a believer; not signifying that thing in the
very mind, but in respect of his receiving the Sacrament
of that very thing; to wit, of believing, and giving his
name to Christ.</q>

True, infants have neither ability nor will to come to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism;
nor can those (though of years) who are accidentally
disabled: they have not power, though they have a will
to come. What is this to our deferring Infants Baptism
in the Rule, which in some cases may reasonably and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
be done. As for example, Suppose an infant neer
some <hi>Mahumetan</hi> border were found, and the parents not
known, we may and ought to demur. But what makes
this against baptizing infants of parents known to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

<q>To which if we add that the parents of S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> S. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom,</hi>

were culpable. We read of his dangerous estate while he

follow the faith of that Citie in which he had received the
garment of Christ, as the same <hi>Erasmus</hi> gives the sense in
the life of <hi>Hierom,</hi> proves not that he was not baptized
before he was 30 years old: for <hi>Hieroms</hi> words are to this
sense, because the <hi>Eastern Churches</hi> have rent the seamless
Coat of Christ (by their schismes) so that it is hard there
to know where the Church is, therefore I thought it meet
that I should consult with <hi>Peters</hi> Chaire, and the faith

now requiring food for my soul, where long since I tooke

of his being baptized in <hi>Rome,</hi> 'tis grounded but upon an

orders. And what solidity is there on these conjectures, to
conclude that <hi>Hieroms</hi> parents, though Christian, defer'd his
baptism until he was 30 years old? or what wil it advantage
you if it were true? there may be such lets to sealing, as

                  </gap>Argument, lame on both feet, doth poorly
charge: 1. 'Tis not true that all is against the perpetual
Analogie of Christs Doctrine for which no express pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of Christ, or practice of himself or his Apostles ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears;
for there are many things circumstantial and indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,
neither commanded nor forbidden, which yet on
second thoughts you will not say are <hi>against the perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Analogie of Christs Doctrine:</hi> I might instance the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures,
or numbers, or sexes, or places where, in the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Lords Supper: Where do you read of any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of Christ, or practice of himself or Apostles, that
the Communicants should stand, or sit, or kneel, or lie
down; one of these (or if you can think of any other)
must needs be; shew us either precept or practice obliging
to either; where is any precept of Christ obliging to a set
or determined number of Communicants: where are we
commanded to administer to women? where is any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
obliging to a place? who knows not that these and
the like things are left under the general rule, <hi>Let all
things be done decently, and in order?</hi> which observed they
are not against the <hi>Analogie of Christs Doctrine.</hi> Again,
what think you of the Sabath, is that which we now doe
therein against the <hi>Analogie of Christs Doctrine,</hi> because
we find no express precept or practice of Christ or his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples
for the translation of it? That it is and ought to
be the Christian Sabbath, is grounded on necessary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
but no express precept. 2. It is also notorious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
false, that Christ never gave any express precept to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize
all Nations, without any exception to infants within
the Covenant; and who knoweth not that infants ever
were and are a great part of every Nation; what then?
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:31222:46"/>
though he never said in so many syllables, or by naming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,
go and baptize them also, is it not sufficient to name
all Nations without enumeration of particulars? Indeed
he needed not give such an express <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ommand concerning
children, seeing that he sent them to administer this seal
of the new Covenant and Sacrament of initiation, who
were in the old, their selves sealed in their infancy by cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision,
and so used to that Doctrine of childrens being
within the Covenant with believing parents, and the dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
practice of their initiation and reception into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of a visible Church, that it might have seemed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
superfluous to say any more then <hi>Go baptize all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
There is also much difference, <hi>Inter ecclesiam consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuendam,
&amp; constitutam;</hi> the Apostles business was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
to baptize Heathens and converted unbelievers;
but we have to deal with a Church constituted; therefore
faith and repentance, were so often mentioned in the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Apostles practice; but we living in a setled
Church, have to deal with baptizing infants who cannot
yet actually believe or repent: But in that no particulars
are mentioned in Christs universal command to baptize,
it sheweth that all within the Church-priviledg and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of God are included. Again, whereas you require
a command <hi>in terminis</hi> for baptizing infants, I demand,

Christ gave his Disciples no express or peculiar command

requires no other previous disposition to infant-baptism,

into the visible Church, and sealed with the external Seal
thereof into the future profession of faith and repentance.
Adde hereto that children under the Gospel, are thus Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of the seal of faith, as children were under the Law,
although they cannot actually repent or believe, which
were and are no less previous dispositions, if we speak of

I say, 3. <hi>A previous disposition</hi> necessary to the capacity

something which yet it hath not, neither was capable
thereof before such a disposition: Now this in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
instance presupposeth, or speaks some change of the
mind by illumination, faith, remorse of conscience, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of leading a new life, and desire to be implanted into
Christ and the communion of Saints by baptism; and so
it is internal; or professing of that endeavour of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the mysteries of the Gospel, saith and repentance testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied

in persons of years coming to baptism.</p>
               <p>2. there is a previous disposition of the subject without
any present change of the mind, which springeth from his

the Gospel.</p>
               <q>And not <hi>(say you)</hi> to instance in those innumerable places
that require faith before this Sacrament, there needs
no more but this one, He that believeth and is baptized

               <p>I answer, 1. Deal fairly, dispute <hi>ad idem;</hi> and shew me
one place of Scripture which universally requireth faith
before this Sacrament, and you shall be excused for the
<hi>innumerable places</hi> which you speak of: We can shew
that the rule holds not universally that faith must precede
the Sacraments: for though <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith preceded the
seal thereof, yet <hi>Isaaks</hi> seal preceded his faith: Mr. <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi>
expresseth the reason hereof: <q>Why (saith he) doth
in <hi>Abraham</hi> the Sacrament follow faith, and in <hi>Isaak</hi>

his son it goeth before all understanding? because it
is meet that he, which being in full-grown age is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
into fellowship of the Covenant, from which he
had hitherto been a stranger, should first learn the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
thereof: but an infant begotten of him, need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not so, which by right of inheritance, according
to the form of the promise, is even from his mothers
womb contained in the Covenant.</q> And certainly in
this respect God calleth the infants of covenanted parents,
sons and daughters born unto him,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

37. be esteeming them his children who are born of
those parents to whom God made the promise to be <hi>a God
unto them and their seed after them;</hi> which promise as tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concerns us and our children, as it concerned <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
and his. 2. If the argument be good from that place,
<hi>Mark 16. 16. He that believeth and is baptized;</hi> faith is
first named, and then baptism: ergo, faith must precede
baptism: Why shall not the Argument from other
places be good to the contrary? <hi>as Iohn 3: 5. Except a
man be born of water and of the spirit, he cannot enter into
the Kingdom of God:</hi> Baptism is first named, and then
regeneration; therefore baptism must precede regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
So again <hi>Ephes. 5. 26. Washing with water,</hi> that is,
baptism is mentioned before the word, <hi>ergo,</hi> we must first
be baptized, and afterward receive the word. 3. If this
argument were good, how many men and women of age,
must by the same reason be denyed baptism? For all have
not faith; but the truth is, that to be born in the Church,
is unto, or in infants instead of profession of faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
as to the outward seal, for which we contend;
and profession of faith and repentance, is to and for the
<hi>adult</hi> instead of the same, for their right to the desired seal
(so was it to <hi>Ismael,</hi> and <hi>Esau</hi> whom God hated) because
they were born of covenanted parents. 4. Sure it is that
Christ in the forementioned place, speaketh of men and
women of years: For you confess that infants as such,
cannot believe; and what then must follow if your cruel
principles were true? Christ saith, <hi>But he that believeth
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:31222:49"/>
not, shall be damned:</hi> If this were as you would have it, spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
concerning infants also, what should become of all
those that die in their infancy? what are they damn'd?
Here appears an inexcusable perversness of these men, who
when children are proposed to their interest in general
terms granted them, there they would exclude them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
they shew a particular warrant; and baptize all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
without a baptize infants, shall not advantage them
for the seal of their admission into Christs visible Church:
But where a general rule is mentioned, from whence they
are in reason and all charitable construction to be exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
there it must include them for their disadvantage, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to damnation, without any particular warrant for
such inteterpretation. Mr. <hi>Cobbet</hi> observeth well, That

I demand then, Do infants believe? Why do ye deny
them baptism? or because they have not faith, do you
conclude them all damned who die in their infancy? That
were a damnable assertion; and to pay you with your
own coyn, <hi>Against the perpetual analogie of Christs Doctrine,</hi>
who commanded infants to be brought unto him, bless
them, and positively affirmed, that <hi>Of such is the Kingdom of

is notoriously false; for all want of faith doth not abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
damn: For 1. They who pray for faith, or the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creases
thereof, (as the Disciples did) want faith, yet were
they not damned; he that hungereth and thirsteth for
the righteousness of faith, wanteth the same; for hunger

               <p>A very acute and witty assertion indeed; but we answer,
1. By this principle you might have been as blasphemous

under the Law. 2. We say not but that infants by their
incapacity, are excused from actual susception of baptism,
for they cannot act thereto: But parents are not excusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,

therefore they are to be baptized that they may attain

work faith in the hearers: To conclude, Baptism profiteth
not without faith; yet is it an effectual means whereby God
worketh regeneration and salvation, therefore none with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

baptized into future repentance and faith, which although
they be not yet formed in them, yet by the secret operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

in the same chapter he saith as <hi>Paul</hi> there reasoneth, That
the <hi>Iews</hi> are sanctified of their parents; so in another place
he teacheth. That the children of Christians receive the
same sanctification of their fathers: Also in the same
chapter he saith—not that I mean rashly to affirm, that
they be indued with the same faith which we feel in our
selves, or that they have at all knowledg of faith (which I

it is, that <hi>Calvin,</hi> or any of his, invented it. But the

               <p>Yes, <hi>caeteris paribus:</hi> for though the Sacraments work
not the same effect in all receivers, yet Gods holy Spirit
deserteth not his ordinance in the elect, though for causes
ever just, though most unknown to us, it doth not always
alike shew its power in the recipient. It is true, that the
seal and ministration of man can nothing profit where God
giveth not the inward Baptism by his holy Spirit; though
the inward may save without the outward, as hath been
noted: but your supposition being rightly laid concerning
an elect infant baptized, and so carried away, you must
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:31222:52"/>
grant that God, whose election can by no means be defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
or made voyd, will give and make effectuall the means
to the end, that is, salvation, whether by acquainting the
party baptized with his will declared in his word preached
to him, or by his secret work within him, if he will take
him away in infancy: in the adult, coming to the knowledg
of Gods covenant in Christ, and of his own sealing in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy,
it must make him more confident of his implantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
into Christ, then if he knew that he never had been
baptized. What then? Must this be by vertue of baptism
by water onely, or the externall ministration thereof? No,
but by the power of Gods Spirit working on his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and accomplishing his own decrees, do we follow
your supposition, dividing preaching of the word to such
when they come to years, from the precedent seal? Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
such a strange invention were absolutely without Art,
without Scripture, reason or authority, I would say, as is
your argument here alledged against infant-baptism, but
that you call it <hi>Demonstrative</hi> and <hi>Vnanswerable:</hi> but
consider how to overcome before you cry victory. To an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
your supposition; suppose that an infant were not
by any habituall faith so much as disposed to any actuall
belief without a new master; what could this conclude
more then that it is necessary to the actuall faith of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
come to fit years, that he be taught the doctrine of
faith, repentance, &amp;c. which we constantly affirm: what
makes this against infant-baptism? We unanimously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
and solemnly profess, that the infant, so soon as it
shall be able to learn, ought to be, and shall be taught the
mysteries of eternall life and salvation by Christ: so your
demonstration proves but a poor fallacie: you utterly
mistaking or willingly dissembling the question. We af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
not that the Word ought to be divided from the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
whereof new-born infants are capable, but that
the word is to be preached to them, &amp; they are to be instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
in all the Rudiments of Christian Religion, so soon as
they shal be able to learn: I only add hereto, what have you
said in this your so much applauded argument against in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-baptism,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:31222:52"/>
which might not as reasonably and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
have been urged against infant-circumcision? Could
they if sent into Painim-Countreys with all the terms of
your supposition, have been more disposed to an actual be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
without a new Master? yet they had, and we have
right to the seal of the righteousnesse of Faith, not for
any excellency or ability to produce any good and saving
effect in our selves, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Next, you say,
<q>To which also this consideration may be added,<note place="margin">Pag. 241: Numb. 30.</note> That if bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
be necessary to the salvation of infants, upon
whom is the imposition laid?]</q>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning Baptism in generall, 'tis considerable which
<hi>Tertullian</hi> saith, <hi>The Lord himself who owed no repentance,
was baptized; and was it not necessary to sinners?</hi> his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
will reach (possibly beyond his opinion) to infants al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,

is necessary to the salvation of infants; yet in
case of privation or impossibility, they are saved by the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
and extraordinary goodness and providence of God.
So that the necessity of Baptism, as hath been avowed, is
not absolute, as if none could be saved without it; but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
on our part, who are to obey the ordinance of God.
God is not tied to his ordinance, but we are: he can other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
save, but we cannot be saved in the contempt thereof

               <p>You might have pleaded the same against circumcision,
with as good success: They could neither hinder it, nor
do any thing to further it; did it therefore do them no
benefit at all? But who faith it is <hi>per modum recipientis,</hi>
&amp;c. which is not properly expressed according to the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposition,
Per modum</hi> speaks a cause, <hi>ad,</hi> or <hi>secundum,</hi> a
condition: We say that the Sacrament doth work accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the dispositions of the receivers, because God gives
that to infants which makes them fit to be baptized, giving
them by his own Covenant with his believieving parents,
federal holyness, and so a right to the external initiatory
seal of his Covenant with them: Whether it do them good
or no, whether it produce a spiritual good effect or no
(that is to regeneration and salvation) a right they have
to the external seal, as being born within the Church, and
that as soon as they are born; we understand not any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>predisposing</hi> cause in the infant to be baptized, as if he
were able to contribute any thing to his receptibility, more
then the unborn <hi>Iacob</hi> was in relation to the love of God,
which indeed never found any cause but it self;<note place="margin">Rom. 9. 11, &amp;c. 2. Cor. 5. 10. Rom. 3. 20.</note> yet ere the
children were born, God loved <hi>Iacob</hi> and hated <hi>Esau.</hi>
Further we say, as we shall be saved <hi>secundum opera,</hi> but
not <hi>propter opera:</hi> Good works are in the regenerate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
signes of justification and salvation future, they
cannot be the causes of either; they follow, they cannot
precede justification: So we may say that baptism works
according to the dispositions of the suscipient, which are
not in infants, faith, profession, repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which
God gives not to infants, but to persons of years; but as
to their right to baptism by his Couenant: what other
predispositions are in them are secret, and known to God
above. And so your <hi>exploded fancy</hi> and dream of a notable
advantage vanisheth.
<q>Either baptism (<hi>you say</hi>) is a meer Ceremony, or it implies
a duty on our part. If it be a ceremony only, how doth
it sanctifie us, or make the comers thereunto perfect? If
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:31222:55"/>
it implys a duty on our part, how then can children receive
it, who cannot do duty a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e twisted up together? We
answer plainly, Ceremony and duty on mans part, are not
<hi>membra dividentia,</hi> nor always contradistinct; for they may
<hi>coïncidere;</hi> as in those ceremonies of the Law, which being
commanded of God, were duties of men subject to the Law,
and to be performed, though they could not <hi>make the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
thereunto perfect:</hi> and so is baptism now a duty on our
part to be administred, though of it self it cannot make all
the comers thereunto perfect. But you demand, if it implies
<hi>a duty on our part, how then can children receive it, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
do duty at all?</hi> Where is now the <hi>revelation, reason, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
sense, and all experience in the world,</hi> in which you so
lately triumphed, as if you had driven us to take sanctuary?
If it be a duty on our part to administer it, how can chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
receive it, <hi>who cannot do any duty at all?</hi> Nay but tell
me, if you can, by all your reason, how could infants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
baptism except we did administer it? say you, how
can he be passive who cannot be active at all? how could
infants receive circumcision, who could do as little duty
as infants now can? That <hi>homonymical</hi> (on our part) must
be otherwise limited by some expression, or else your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
will appear fallacious. It is a duty on our part to
baptize infants; on the childrens part no duty is required;
they can do none, as such; for God enjoyneth no impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibilities.
But you say,
<q>This way of ministration, makes baptism to be wholly an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
duty, a work of the Law, a carnal Ordinance, it makes
us adhere to the letter, without any regard of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
&amp;c.]</q>

               <p>This <hi>Rhetorick</hi> would somthing better becom him that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
not what, but how much he saith. All these vain and
injurious expressions, are meer aspersions: and call you
this an Argument considerable? wherein appears either
matter or form thereto pertinent? For the rest (which in

we say if you mean by <hi>Mystery,</hi> the spiritual baptism my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steriously

signified by the outward ministration, to which
you seem to drive, 'tis evident that it doth not alwaies ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company

                  <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi>
and all others who fall away: And as certainly false
is it, that <hi>it never follows in order of time;</hi> common experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
shewing that the spiritual seed sowed in baptism, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times, and in many of the baptized, lieth long before
it actually appeareth, either in any outward effects, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
signes of calling, or fruits of regeneration; as in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
faith preceded, and circumcision the seal of the
righteousness of faith, followed: so in <hi>Cornelius,</hi> a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
sanctification preceded, and baptism followed; but in
<hi>Isaak</hi> circumcised the eight day, the seal preceded, and
faith and sanctity followed:<note place="margin">Augustin. contr. Donat. l. 4. c. 21.</note> So in Infant-baptism the seal
and laver of regeneration goeth before, and actual faith
followeth it in season, if they hold fast the faith of Christ.
You say again,
<q>Baptism is never propounded, mentioned or enjoyned as a
means of remission of sins, or of eternal life, but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of duty, choice, and sanctity is joyned with it, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to production of the end so mentioned. Know you not
that as many as are baptized into Christ Iesus,<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 3.</note> are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
into his death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>]</q>
               </p>
               <p>Good reason that such things should be propounded,
mentioned and enjoyned to those who converting to the
faith in years capable of Doctrine, require the seal of Gods
Covenant; and certainly so was it to Proselytes to be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised;
but you cannot reasonably think, that they proposed
or enjoyned Infants to be circumcised any such things:
and it were as vain to propose any of these to Infants now
to be baptized: Therefore we seal them now, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
these like things to them when they be capable:
Now the Scripture speaking to men or women of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
propounds to them their present duty who are
to be baptized, or who are baptized, as faith, repentance,
walking in newness of life, mortification; and (as hath
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:31222:56"/>
been said) the Apostles in the <hi>ecclesiâ constituendâ</hi> had
mostly to do, being to endeavour the calling and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Gentiles, who before were aliens from the
Covenant of God: But in <hi>ecclesiâ constitutâ,</hi> we rarely
meet with any first to be taught, and then to be sealed;
the children of Christian parents having Church-privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,
are now baptized first (as in the setled Covenant
under the Law they were first circumcised) and when they
come to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<q>—And then have they but one member of the distinction
used by S <hi>Peter,</hi> they have that baptism which is a putting
away the filth of the flesh; but they have not that baptism

which is the only baptism that saveth us—]</q>
               </p>
               <p>I answer, 1. You vainly dispute <hi>è non concessis;</hi> 'tis not
granted, nor can it ever be proved that elect children in
baptism are not <hi>formed new in righteousness and holyness;</hi>
and so your superstruction concerning their having only
that baptism which is <hi>a putting away the filth of the flesh;</hi>
but not the rest necessary to salvation, is frivolous. 2. <hi>The
answer of a good conscience toward God,</hi> is an effect of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
baptism by the spirit of Jesus, peculiar to the elect.
Now if your reason hence taken, for the exclusion of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
from baptism, the external seal, were good; by the
same reason none but the elect, or those who have the <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer

know you, but that they who fairly profess faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,

And where is then their <hi>answer of a good conscience

that which is and shall be sufficient to their salvation in

Christ, though they die before man can teach them more:
and why shall man exclude them from the external Seal
of Gods Covenant with them (as being born within the
Church) of which they have as evident (and a more easie)
capacity then children had of circumcision? God gives
Infants the incomparably greater and more excellent part,
sanctity and sealing to salvation; and shall man presume to
deny the less and subordinate part, the external Seal of
Christs visible Church, whereof Reprobates, born within
the Church, have a capacity? 4. Faith, good conscience,
repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are in the elect those fruits, whose seeds
were sowen in baptism; and (as hath been said) were it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
to say, we may not sow untill the fruits thereof ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear?
Nay, but we therefore sow in hope, that we may in
due season see and reap the fruits thereof. 5. Whereas you
say that the answer of a good conscience towards God, is
the <hi>only baptism that saveth us;</hi> I answer, 1. It is not the
answer of a good conscience that saveth any man, though
a good conscience be an excellent signe of our salvation
by Christ;<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 1, 2.</note> for, <hi>Being justified by faith, we have peace with
God through our Lord Iesus Christ, by whom also we have
access by faith,</hi> &amp;c. 2. Your reasoning is fallacious, your
medium being <hi>homonymical:</hi> For, allowing you the signe
for the cause, yet if that <hi>(which saveth us)</hi> though it may
be true, if understood concerning persons of years, and as
good conscience, an undoubted effect of regeneration, is
opposed to the bare seal thereof, without any inward ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of the spirit. I say if it be understood of Infants, as in
your sense, excluded from a capacity of good conscience,
or the acts thereof, it is very false, except you will also ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
<hi>all Infants</hi> from salvation, which were against the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
doctrine of Christ.</p>
               <q>As infants (<hi>you say)</hi> by the force of nature cannot put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into a supernatural condition (and therefore say the
Poedobaptists, they need baptism to put them into it) so if
they be baptized before the use of reason, before the works
of the spirit, before the operation of grace, before they can
throw off the works of darkness, and live in righteousness
&amp; newness of life, they are never the near.]</q>
               <p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:31222:57"/>
I answer, 1. Neither can men of years <hi>by the force of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
put themselves into a supernatural condition,</hi> supposing
you mean subordinate to salvation; and what then can the
use of reason without the works of the Spirit, advantage
them hereto? Shall not they therefore that have the use
of reason be baptized? 2. What do you herein say
which might not as well have been objected against the
circumcision of infants? Would you have concluded
them never the neer, because at eight dayes old they
had not the use of reason to know what or why it was
so done u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>to them before they could throw off the works
of darkness, and live in righteousness and newness of life?</p>
               <p>3. If you will have none baptized <hi>before the works of the
Spirit, before the operations of grace, &amp;c.</hi> when and whom
may you baptize? For <hi>the wind bloweth where it listeth,
and thou hearest the sound thereof,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 3. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>but canst not tell whence it
cometh and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of
the Spirit.</hi> God can, and doth sanctifie infants (as in the
elect infants, dying such must be granted, if you have so
much reason or charity as to think that at least some of
them are elected and saved) and he can and doth sanctifie
in age, sometimes in the very last act thereof, as appeared
in the penitent thief; how then will it follow that infants
are never the neerer if they be baptized before the use of
reason, &amp;c. 4. We must understand that baptism compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth
first, the sign water, and the whole ceremony,
sprinkling, washing, or dipping into water in the Name of
the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghost. Secondly, the
things themselves signified by the visible and externall
things, which are sprinkling of the blood of <hi>Iesus</hi> on the
baptized for the remission of sins, mortification of the old
man, quickning the new man into certain hope of resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to eternall life to come. Thirdly, the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
&amp; promise of <hi>Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> whence the sign hath authority

hope well of every one whom we baptize, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:31222:59"/>
whom we can say nothing to the contrary. But
you say,
<q>All vows made by persons under other names, stipulations
made by minors, are not valid till they (be) by a superve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
act after they are of a sufficient age to ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ifie them.]</q>
To which we answer, 1. though all be not valid in such case,
it is enough that some are: 2. Your assertion, if granted, that
is, that all vows or (which is more then you affirm) if no
vows made by persons under others names, or <hi>stipulations
made by minors,</hi> or persons in their minority, are not valid
untill by a supervening act after they are of sufficient age
to ratifie them they are confirmed: what could this make
against our duty of Infant-baptism? the case being much
different between stipulations of men, and the covenant
between God &amp; man, as hath been shewed, &amp; as appeared
in circumcision which was with Infants eight days old.
Mr. <hi>Cobbet</hi> well observeth,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>In Gen. 17. p. p.</hi> 99, &amp;c.</note> that the covenant of grace is as
well a testament, 1 <hi>Cor. 11. 25. Heb. 9. 15, &amp;c.</hi> Now a testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
may be, and useth to be made in reference to little
ones without knowledge: nor do any use to deny a childs
right in the Testators will,—because it understood not
the same: and that many Infants with whom God made
the covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. dying such, were yet saved: and that
they restipulate in their Parents knowing acceptance of the
covenant, and professed owning of it upon the Covenant
terms, as wel on their childrens parts as their own: &amp; they
restipulate in a passive reception of the Covenant condition
&amp; bond to after imitation of their father <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith &amp;
obedience. Again, our question is not concerning the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
or effect of Infant-baptism, by their act or acts, to
make it good to themselves and effectuall, when they come
of age; but concerning a Church-priviledge on Infants
part, which is to be admitted unto the externall seal of
Gods Covenant with his Church, it being to Parents and
their children; and this dependth on Gods institution to
appoint it, and his inward working to make it good: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
in the confirmation of children come to age, they
then professing faith, obedience, repentance, newness of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:31222:59"/>
life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> into which in their infancy they were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
that is, then ratified which others promised and
stipulated for them, as concerning outward, profession,
which is in your language a <hi>supervening act,</hi> to make
the former appear valid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thirdly, the question is not
concerning the final effect of baptism in particulars bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
which cannot fall under the Ministers cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance
(it being kept in heaven in the <hi>archives</hi> and secret
counsel of God) but concerning their right to baptism,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 4.</note>
who are born within the verge and precincts of the
Church. Whether such infants doe afterwards believe,
repent, and amend their lives to salvation by Christ, or
not, we cannot foresee, nor have we any exception to
supersede or limit our duty of administring the outward
seal of baptism: For as much as children born of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
parents and within the Church, are thereby partakers
of the Covenant of grace, even they who are not partakers
of the grace of the Covenant. Fourthly, we answer, That
children in Gods account, do vow, confess, and avouch
the Lord in their parents vowing, confession, or avouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him, as they did of old; which the learned Mr. <hi>Cobbet</hi>

to do, who iterate, or again do, or resume that which is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance
or similitude of Christs suffering, who died but
once: for in a reiterating it, we declare or intimate the first
to be void; and so if we will have a new baptism, we must
have a new Christ, and he must in our Symbole suffer, as
if one Christ, or his once suffering were not sufficient for
our redemption. And is not this to <hi>pollute the bloud of the
everlasting Covenant and Testament,</hi> and to crucifie again
the Son of God. Secondly, this may be said in respect of
reciduation or falling away from Christ (as they do who
renounce their baptism by which they were implanted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, by receiving another baptism) because the merit
of Christs Cross being abolished and made void, by which
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:31222:61"/>
they were once renewed, it must needs be that Christ
should be crucified again and put to shame,<note place="margin">Quia abolito &amp; irrito reddito crucis Christi <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

are within the Church as born of Christian parents,
or in their conversion, profession of faith and repentance,
desire to be admitted into the same: Adde hereto that
Christ particularly cautioned for children, left any
should despise them, openly declaring, that of such is
the kingdome of heaven: And yet the doing of this
duty is <hi>dishonour to the Sacrament, and Pageantry</hi>
with you:<note place="margin">Mat. 12. 36.</note> But, <hi>If of every idle word which men shall

to them, in respect of these things for which they can

baptism like the fig-tree in the Gospel, full of leaves,

               <p>I say, 1. Can you be assured that none of these who

Mediator, one Faith, one Baptism which we received
in our infancy, have such a testimony of Gods holy

I also assent to: but can by no means be of your opinion,
that there is less evidence then truth <hi>on our side;</hi> as any ways
intimating a defect of evidence: therefore I say, 1. That <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
sensu forensi,</hi> in common sense of controversies, or
matters of <hi>judicature,</hi> importeth <hi>sufficient proof:</hi> so we say
that witnesses give in <hi>evidence;</hi> that is, not alwayes <hi>in ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis,</hi>
and express words, as in actions of case is requirable;
nor as they say, <hi>ore rotundo,</hi> as to say, <hi>Verres</hi> is a <hi>Thief. &amp;c.</hi>
but from considerable circumstances, or necessarie conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
sufficient to evince, and to inform to sentence.
This evidence on our side you will not denie in this case, nor
(I suppose) affirm that falshood hath more proof or evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in Scripture then truth. 2. Sometimes we speak of
<hi>evidence</hi> in relation to the partie or parties to be informed;
in which, not only his or their capacitie is considerable, but
also other circumstances; as the Informers expression,
which possibly may be defective; the Informeds attention,
for want whereof, that may not appear which were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
sufficiently evident. Again, In case of Gods judgment o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the disobedient given over to strong delusions, that they
should believ lyes and be damned,<note place="margin">2 Thess. 2. 11.</note> who received not the love

saved: hereof sec <hi>Isa. 6. 9, 10. Mat.</hi> 13. 13, 14, 15. To a blind
man, or one that winketh in the clearest &amp; most evident light,
no colours or proportions are evident; because men if blind
cannot, if obstinate &amp; schismatical, wil not see &amp; understand.</p>
               <p>3 There is a <hi>notius natura,</hi> and a <hi>notius nobis:</hi> if in the
evidence you speak of, you mean the first, and that errour
and falshood is more known in nature, that is manifestly
false; for the truth is first and best known in nature. If
you mean the second, that is, that we less know the truth
then the evidence; what blame you in our cause, or advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
your Clients? If you say we see no evidence, nor can
the blind see the Sun; what can you gain hereby? it may
be, and certainly is, that the Gospels light is hid to some,
the Apostle will tell you to whom, and why, 2 <hi>Cor. 4. 3, 4.
It is hid to them that are lost, in whom the God of this world
hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:31222:64"/>
light of the glorious Gospel of Christ—should shine unto them</hi>
—we undertake not to make the truth evident to every
gain-sayer and despiser thereof, but say of such an one, as
<hi>Elisha</hi> for his servant at the beleaguered <hi>Dothan, 2 King.
6. 17. Lord, I pray thee open his eyes that he may see.</hi> The most
manifest light of the Gospel had not evidence enough with
the <hi>Pharisees,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 13.</note> whom Christ pronounced blind; and it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
them chiefly which he said, <hi>they have winked with
their eyes, &amp;c.</hi> an unbeliever may doubt of any truth, and
then it is not evident to him. The old <hi>Academicks</hi> were
wont to question the testimonie and evidence of their own

of that they saw with their eyes, and heard with their ears.
<hi>Carneades</hi> doubted of all things; yet certainly many things
were evident of themselves to those who could and would

who deny convincing evidence in Gods Word, not only erre
not knowing the Scriptures, but tacitely accuse the Wisdom
and Providence of God for mans salvation, of insufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie:
for how shall matters of controversie concerning faith
and manners he decided without sufficient evidence? and if
you think there is not sufficient evidence in Scripture to keep
us from errour, and to direct us in the way of truth and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
in what other rule, or testimonie will you place such

To the folding up of all, I might repeat sundry things
which as necessarily conclude our Infant-baptism, as Infants
circumcision into the same faith: Gods Covenant with
<hi>Abraham</hi> and his spiritual seed, that is, all Beleevers:
Christs honouring Infants with sacred embraces, proposing
them as heirs and patterns designed for the Kingdome of
heaven; the extent of Gods federal promise to us and our
children; childrens capacitie of the inward baptism, signified
in the external sign: whole Families and Nations baptized,
of which children are,<note place="margin">Act. 2. 39.</note> and ever were a great part; Christs
absolute command to baptize all Nations, without any tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of exception to Infants; Infants-federal and ecclesiastical
holiness by their parents, and their own right: But that I
would not be irksom to the prudent and pious Reader, to
whom I heartily wish a right understanding in all things,
constancie in the truth, and unitie of the holy Spirit, that we
may all meet in Gods eternal kingdom of glory.</p>

Unto which we answer, 1 That in the cited place there
was not intended an exact and compleat model of Christs
commission to the Apostles; for there is no mention of the
Lords Supper: Christ only nameth the two more usual
things for making or initiating disciples for the gathering of
a Church, that is, teaching for them who were capable, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and baptizing for them and their children not yet capable
of doctrine; that having their names given unto Christ, and
being admitted into his school, they might as they grew up
to capacitie, be instructed concerning the mysteries of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
in Christ: neither was this the first institution of
baptism; for when Christ spake these words, he was about
to ascend up into heaven: he had some years before that time
appointed baptism among the Iews converted to the faith,
and confirmed it by his own reception of baptism, not that
he needed it, or had any sin to be washed away therein;
but to sanctifie the element of water by his
sacred body,<note place="margin">

                  <p>2. Christ then sent his Disciples to convert and baptize
those Gentiles, who possibly had not so much as heard of
Christ, much less of faith in him, and baptism into his
Church: it was necessary therefore that the Apostles
should first instruct them what they were to do in baptism,
and why: but when the parents were baptized and instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
so that there were <hi>Churches</hi> setled among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles;

are of years must necessarily first be taught, and afterward

baptized. When <hi>Abraham</hi> according to Gods command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
came to circumcise the men of his family, doubtless
he first instructed them, and preached to them the reason,
use, and end of that sacrament, according as the Lord said,
<hi>Gen. 18. 19. I know him that he will command his children,
and his houshold after him, and they shall keep the way of the

born of Christian Parents, they being already within the
Covenant and Church, and so having present right to the

the Seal went long before the faith or profession there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                  <q>God bringeth not the blinde into his Covenant,<note place="margin">Object 7.</note> but enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

                  <p>We answer: 1. God calleth the poor, maimed, halt, and
lame unto the great supper, that is the Communion of Christ,
<hi>Luke</hi> 14. 21.</p>
                  <p>2. The Greek Divines were wont to call Baptism <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>,
Illumination; and it can be no less then impious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
to affirm, That God doth not in the Baptism of
Elect Infants, secretly infuse such a light as he knoweth suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to their salvation; seeing that it is certain, that as God
dwelleth not in all that know him,<note place="margin">Aug. Epist. 57.</note> 
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 21. so neither do all
those presently know him in whom he dwelleth by the spirit
of illumination and regeneration (until they have received
such a further measure of the Spirit which is of God, that
they may know the things which are freely given to them
of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 12.) which appears, in that Elect chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

not believe that God will graciously bear with an Infants
present defect of understanding, which himself gives him
by degrees, and in such measure and time as his self ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointeth?</p>
                  <p>4. As Faith and Confession sufficed the penitent Thief,
without Baptism; so Baptism, the Seal of the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Faith and Repentance sufficeth an Elect Infant, dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
without confession of Faith, and actual Repentance;
and the living, until he come of age and ability to know and
make profession.</p>
                  <q>With the heart man believeth unto Righteousness,<note place="margin">Object. 8.</note> and with
the mouth confession is made unto Salvation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 10.
But Infants can do neither of these; therefore they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
the holy Seal, who give it to them who cannoe be
profited thereby.</q>
                  <p>We answer. 1. The same might have been objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
circumcision, where the Seal sufficed, until the sealed
came to years and ability to believe and confess. 2. The
Apostles speaks there concerning persons of years, it nothing
concerns Infants, as such. 3. If giving the Seal to those who
cannot be profited thereby, be profanation of the same, how
often do you prophane the holy Seal? How can any meer
man know whom to baptize, though of years, and whom
to put by? None can foresee mens final estates but God
alone. We know that <hi>Iudas</hi> and <hi>Simon Magus</hi> were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
though whatsoever they confessed with their mouth,
'tis certain they did not believe with their heart unto righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness.
Did their Baptizers profane Baptism? If not, how
maliciously is this objected against us, baptizing Infants of
Believers, Christ himself expresly avowing them as subjects
of his Kingdom?</p>
                  <q>The Seals of the New Testament are perfect and spiritual:<note place="margin">Object. 9.</note>
But Infants are carnal; and, <hi>The natural man receiveth
not the things of the Spirit of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 14. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
these Seals agree not to, and with Infants present in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity.</q>
                  <p>We answer, The Apostle there speaks concerning the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
of divine mysteries, not comprehensible of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:31222:72"/>
and carnal men: Now Infants being carnal, as born of
flesh,<note place="margin">John 3 35.</note> want Regeneration, that they may become spiritual,
and enter into the Kingdom of God; and because they are
by corrupted nature imperfect, therefore they ought to be
admitted to the ordinary means by God appointed to make
them perfect.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>The Apostle biddeth us,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Object. 10.</note> Draw near with a true heart, in
full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled
from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with
pure water, <hi>Hebr. 10. 22. Which seeing Infants cannot
for present do, the washing of their bodies with the pure
water of Baptism belongeth to others who can have a good
conscience, not to them.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>We answer, The Apostle there sheweth, what we who
are baptized, and of age ought to do, and with what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
not who ought to be baptized; and so it nothing
concerneth Infants till they come of age.</p>
                  <q>Baptism which saveth us,<note place="margin">Object. 11.</note> is with the testimony of a good
conscience:<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 21.</note> This Infants cannot have who have no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
Therefore Infants ought not to receive that Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism
which cannot save them.</q>
                  <p>We answer, 1. The Apostle speaks not there of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of Baptism, but of the fruits and effects thereof in those
who are of ripe years; the fruits which indeed Elect In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,
if living, shall here reap in due time; and into which
they are for present sealed: Now the outward Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the sign of the Covenant (concerning which our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
question is) is one thing, and the inward effect thereof
another:<note place="margin">Matth. 13.</note> As it is also in the Word preached, the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
must be indifferently to all, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 15. whether
stony, thorny, highway, or good ground, Gods Seeds-men
must diligently sow; the fruit and efficacy will be to Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
only, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 4. 2. but that no meer man can fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see.</p>
                  <p>2. What Illumination Infants have by the secret working
and influence of Gods holy Spirit, belongeth to Gods secret
councel, and therefore not to our inquest.</p>
                  <p>3. Sanctification, more then Ecclesiastical, in order of
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:31222:73"/>
time doth not always precede the Seal and Sacrament there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
as may be proved from Infant Circumcision, but by the
Sacrament which implanteth us into Christ, and which is
therefore the washing of Regeneration and Renovation, the
seeds of Faith, Sanctity, and good conscience are sowed in
us, which by a powerful and secret working of the Holy
Ghost, sheweth it self in due season; without which work of
the Spirit, the Gospel most powerfully preached, and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
duly administred to the most knowing men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,

                  <p>We answer, Here is an <hi>Ignoratio Elenchi</hi> in the mistake
of the Question; which is not, Whether that teaching ought
to be divided from Baptism, which we affirm not: but the
contrary; persons of years ought first to be taught to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
and repent, and then to be baptized: But our que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
is not concerning the Baptism of Adults, or persons ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of these things for the present, but of Infants; here
again the question is mistaken, and therefore such disputes
are fallacious. It is true, the water without the Word can
make no Sacrament, nor give any sacramental effect; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
neither young nor old may be baptized, where the
Gospel is not first preached and received: For Baptism is
a seal of the Gospel; but believing Parents have been taught,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:31222:73"/>
received the Gospel, and been sealed into Gods Covenant;
therefore they ought to present their children to Baptism,
who are joynt Covenanters with them. Again, Baptism
is administred with the words of institution by Christ ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed;
take away the Word, and what is the Water but
ordinary water? The Word is added to the element, and
makes the Sacrament—Whence is this so great vertue
of the Water, that it but toucheth the body, and cleanseth
the heart, but by the Word; not because it is spoken, but
because it is believed. Moreover, though God taught <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
concerning the Sacrament of Circumcision, and so he
was circumcised and all his Males, yet he circumcised <hi>Isaac</hi> at
eight days old; &amp; so long before that word of faith could be
preached to <hi>Isaac,</hi> he received the same Sacrament and Seal
of the same Righteousness of faith in Christ, in whom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
we also are saved. Men of ripe years were first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
concerning the institution, end and use of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and then received the Seal; but Infants (as such, not
capable of instruction) first received the Seal of Faith; and
if they lived to years, then they were taught, yet the Word
and the Seal were not parted in either: So is it in Infant-Baptism
now.</p>

they were little portable children; had they been of mans

have been too heavy to have been carried in the arms. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
there can be no rational doubt, but that he blessed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,
properly so called, who took on him Infancy to save
them: Nor may we think that they are less then blessed of
Christ, who are saved by his blood, as Infants are.</p>
                  <q>That which God Commandeth not in some express precept

is no where in Scripture commanded in any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
Precept; Therefore it is no better then mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
Will-worship, and may not be done.</q>
                  <p>We answer, 1. By demanding, <hi>quanta est major Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitio?</hi>
if it be universal, the sense running thus, All that is
Will-worship, which is not commanded in some express Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept;
it is evidently false: For there is no express Precept
for many things left arbitrary, and falling under the Rule of
Decency and Order, which yet are not Will-worship.</p>
                  <p>Next we say, That the substance and Institution of Gods
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:31222:74"/>
worship, must have an express precept for it, or it will fall
under the notion of Will-worship; but in the circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and accidents it is not alwayes so; for example, had not
Christ somewhere commanded to baptize, it had been Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worship
for any man to have instituted that Sacrament: but
though Christ say nowhere baptize children at seven dayes,
six months, seven years; or though he say nowhere
Baptize women;<note place="margin">Mat. 28. 19.</note> yet neither of these are Will-worship, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

                  <p>2 There was an express command for the sealing of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi>

<hi>Abraham, Gal.</hi> 3. 7. that is, his spiritual seed, who have no
less priviledge in things belonging to falvation, then his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
seed. And the Apostles who were Jews and brought up
amongst them, who were sealed in their infancie, did not
(that we read of) so much as ask Christ any question what
they were to do with Infants: and Christ giving them no
prohibition concerning them, he did thereby sufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate,
that he having not repealed the law of sealing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
into his covenant, would have them proceed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Analogie of the first seal of his covenant. The
greater doubt might possibly have been concerning bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
of females, who were not formerly sealed, the doubt
concerning the Gentiles sealing, being removed by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
precept, <hi>Baptize all Nations, Mat.</hi> 28. 19.</p>
                  <p>3 On this very ground on which Anabaptists deny In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-baptism,<note place="margin">Euthym. in Mat. 22.</note>
the old Sadduces denyed the resurrection of
the dead, because they found it not expresly written in the

                  <p>4 Although we read not <hi>in terminis,</hi> and so many words
and syllables in holy Scripture, <hi>Baptize Infants,</hi> yet we
read it in most firm and evident consequence, if we but hold
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:31222:75"/>
these three certain conclusions. 1 That Children are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
and born in sin, the children of wrath. 2 That God
would not have them perish, but rather be brought into
the holy communion of Christ and his Church, that they
may be saved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3 That he hath appoin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ed no other exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
ordinary means, to us known, for Infants regeneration,
but baptism.</p>
                  <p>5 If the matter must be put upon express words of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
let our Antagonists shew us where they are expresly
forbidden to baptize Infants? where is there any syllable
express, or probable for re-baptizing any? where have
they any express precept for dipping over head and ears?
where have they any express precept for their long prayers,
for baptizing women, or administring the communion to
them? shew us any express precept for the change of the
Sabbath.</p>
                  <q>That which we read not expresly mentioned in Scripture
that the Apostles did,<note place="margin">Obj. 15.</note> that we may not do: but we read
not in express words in Scripture, that the Apostles
ever baptized Infants, therefore we may not baptize
them.</q>
                  <p>We answer, 1 If your principle were true, it might thence
be concluded, that the Lords Supper may not be administred
to women, for we no where read in express words, that the
Apostles ever administred it unto them.</p>
                  <p>2 Express words in Scripture are not alwayes necessary
to prove a thing which necessary consequence doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude:
we have no express words in Scripture naming an
<hi>holy Vnitie, in Trinitie and Trinitie in Vnitie,</hi> most undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
consequence we have <hi>Mat. 28. 19, 1 Ioh.</hi> 5. 7. Again, we
have no express word that the Apostles were baptized; for
Christ himself baptized none, <hi>Ioh. 4. 1. &amp;c.</hi> and we read not
where, or when <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> baptized them; yet certainly
they were baptized: we read not expresly that the Apostles
in baptizing mentioned the Father, the Son, and the holy
Ghost; but most certain consequence concludeth it; because
Christ so appointed it, and it was of the <hi>essence</hi> of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
and why should we more tie the baptism of Infants
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:31222:75"/>
to express words, then any of these fundamental things are
tyed? and on the like consequential grounds, why should
we doubt whether the Apostles did indeed usually baptize
Infants of Christians,<note place="margin">Joh. 20. 30. &amp; 21. 25.</note> because it is not expresly written; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that many other words,<note place="margin">Act. 2. 40.</note> matters, and actions of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
and Christ himself, were not written?</p>
                  <p>3 Christ expresly commanded to <hi>baptize all Nations,</hi> in
no one syllable, title, or word therein excepting Infants,
who are and ever were a great and numerous part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
and that which concerneth all alike, concerneth every
part thereof.</p>

                     <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 37, 38. he said, Repent and
be baptized: but Infants can neither actually repent,
nor contribute any thing towards their baptism: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they ought not to be baptized. And again, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3
they confessed their sins and were baptized, which In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
cannot do.</q>
                  <p>We answer, 1 Forasmuch as Infants cannot actually (as
such) repent or confess, it concludeth that these things
for the present, concern not Infants; (for no impossibilitie
is reasonably enjoined any) but belong to persons of years,
or those who were not yet sealed into the communion of
Christs Church, and it is apparent that unto such <hi>Peter</hi>
spake: as far as his words concerned Infants is also express,
<hi>—be baptized every one of you in the name of Iesus Christ
for the remission of sins—for the promise is to you and to your
children;</hi> What promise? why that <hi>Gen.</hi> 177. To what
children was that promise made? what, to those who had
been children, but were now of years to be taught, believe
and repent? No, but to those first who were to be sealed the
eighth day after they were born; who certainly could then no
more actually believe, or repent, then can our Infants now:
therefore 'tis plain to those who will understand, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of years to be taught, must first repent, &amp;c. but In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,
to whom the promise, covenant, or seal thereof joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
belongeth, must be sealed as joint-covenanters with their
Parents, before they can actually believe or repent: for
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:31222:76"/>
why else after this exhortation to repentance and baptism,
doth he mention their children? were they no wayes liable
to this double precept, <hi>repent and be baptized every one of
you?</hi> who? they only who can actually for the present re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent?
nay, but <hi>Peter</hi> knew well that children of whom he
spake, could not do that, by reason of their present want of
the use of reason: yet he knew they had need of remission
of sins by Christ, and that the promise of God was made
to them (without which 'twere but vain for men to seal)
and as firmly concerned them, as their enchurched parents,
and therefore he mentioned them.</p>
                  <q>There appears neither act nor habit of regeneration in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-baptism,<note place="margin">Obj. 17.</note>
until they be taught the Word; neither
any more promptitude to learn it, then is in unbaptized

                  <p>3 It is not true, that baptized Infants have no more

come to years to be taught, then other unbaptized children,
have <hi>caeteris paribus:</hi> for the H. Ghost doth not desert his
own ordinance in the Elect; though for causes very just,
yea, when most unknown to us, it doth not alwayes alike
shew its power: as for the reprobate, the seal or administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of man can nothing profit him who abuseth it, and
where God ever denyeth inward baptism by his holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of sanctification.</p>
                  <q>
                     <pb n="129" facs="tcp:31222:76"/>
Reprobates who cannot be profited by baptism,<note place="margin">Obj. 18.</note> ought not to
be baptized, lest we add to their condemnation: but of
Infants some are such, and we cannot say which of them,
offered to baptism is elect, and which not: therefore see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
we cannot distinguish them, nor can they express
themselves, we ought not to baptize them untill they
can.</q>
                  <p>We answer, If the <hi>major proposition</hi> in this argument be
<hi>universalis negans,</hi> it is most false; for <hi>Simon Magus</hi> and
<hi>Iudas,</hi> who were not profited by their baptism, were yet
rightly baptized; If <hi>particular,</hi> though granted, it would
conclude nothing against Infant-baptism; for by the same
reason they may deny baptism to persons of years: for
alas, many of them are Reprobates. Neither can any meer
man distinguish between the one and the other, seeing that
whatever profession of faith and repentance men make,
'tis possible they may dissemble or fall away. Now we in
charitie, hope the best, where the contrary is not manifest,
and therefore deny them not baptism, who doe but profess
faith, repentance, and desire of baptism: and if we can
have as much charitie to innocent Infants, we must also al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
them baptism, who being born of Christian parents,
are within Gods covenant of Grace. And indeed the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
estate of Infants or aged people, being alike secret and
known to God alone; we must perform our ministrie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectively,
and leave the fruit and issue thereof to God:
so in preaching the Gospel, <hi>the sincere Milk of the Word,
1 Pet.</hi> 2. 2. we do often as it were, draw out the brest like
the mother of the <hi>living child, 1 King.</hi> 3. 20, 21. to some
dead (in belief, sins, and trespasses) laid in our bosome;
who know not who shall profit by it, nor to whom it
shall prove a favour of death unto death; that must be
left to God, but we must instantly preach the Gospel.</p>

in the Gospel of Christ: what doth this concern
Infants?</p>
                  <p>2 Infants have now as much capacitie of baptism, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Law they had of circumcision; both had faith, as
reason, in the feed, though not in the fruit: and the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of baptism now performeth the same to us, which cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision
did to them: as that was to them a sign of their
receiving into the Church and people of God, so is baptism
to us,<note place="margin">Vrun. de relig. Christian. part. 2</note> the first mark which severeth and distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

Infants, who cannot actually beleeve, ought not to be

                  <p>See what hath been said <hi>Obj.</hi> 12. to which we here add,
that this proposition is true concerning persons of years;
but concerneth not Infants in whom we cannot know Gods
present work: but in baptism, the seed of faith, regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
mortification, and newness of life is sowed in them: and
all know that precedence concludeth not separation. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
we say that if faith and baptism must so indivisibly be
united, as that none may be baptized but they who do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
believe, whom might our adversaries baptize, or
whom put by, though of years? If they say they profess
faith, there is much difference between professing and actual
believing: and I much fear that many will too late find as
much distance between justifying faith, and temptation of
securitie, as is between heaven and hell.</p>

                  <p>We answer, The affirmative may from such places be

cannot (therefore none but men so qualified may be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized)

baptized; it cannot conclude negatively against others, that
they may not be baptized who have not received such gifts.</p>
                  <q>If baptizing Infants be grounded on circumcision,<note place="margin">Obj. 22</note> the males

                  <p>We answer, Here is a <hi>fallacia accidentis,</hi> an arguing
from the substance to the circumstance: whereas bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
succeeded circumcision in substance, not in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
circumstance: The substance was; that was a seal of
faith, and Church-priviledge; so is this; that was
administred to all that would join in the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
and their children as being in Gods covenant; so must it be
here: in that was sealed to the Covenanter the promise of
grace and mercie by Christ, which is alwayes one and the
same; so here; that signified mortification, and a promise
on mans part, of faith and obedience to God; so it is here:
that was the inlet to Gods Church, the Sacrament of initia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

                  <q>Though Christ took little children into his arms and blessed

                  <p>2 It cannot appear that Christ commanded not some of

                     <pb n="134" facs="tcp:31222:79"/>
We answer: 1. That wholly concerns those who are of
years; who when the Church was to be collected and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
were first and generally such persons as were first to be
instructed in the faith of <hi>Christ,</hi> and then to be baptized; it
concerned not Infants.</p>
                  <p>2. That which immediately follows, <hi>But he that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
not shall be damned</hi>—manifesteth that it concerned not
Infants, who though they cannot actually believe, yet shall
not all be damned, though dying Infants.</p>
                  <p>3. If those words were to be presidential to all Churches
and times as a rule, what persons we are to baptize, and
what not; that is, that we ought to baptize none but such
and so qualified as are there described; then it would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that you must baptize none, but those who appear
to have a justifying faith; for such there Christ speaks of,
and only such, relating to their salvation: And how few
have this? and how can you who baptize discern this? Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
They must be such as can cast out Devils, speak un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>studied
Languages, take up Serpents, and if they drink any
deadly thing, it shall not hurt them, such as can cure the
sick: For Christ there thus marked out Believers of those
times.</p>
                  <p>4. He saith not, He that believeth not shall not be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed;
for that indeed might have concerned Infants Baptism:
But he saith, <hi>He that believeth not shall be damned;</hi> which
cannot concern Infants, except you will say they have faith
(and so you must grant them a capacity of Baptism) or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
that they all are damned who dye in Infancy, which is
a damnable fancy.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, We must distinguish between an interest in, and
the effects of Baptism. Many thousands born within the
Covenant, have therefore a just interest in the Covenant of
Grace,<note place="margin">In Baptismo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duitur Christus interdum sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento tenus, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdum quoad vitae sanctificationem: primum bonis &amp; malis est commune; secundum bonorum &amp; piorum est proprium. Aug. contr. Donatist. l. 5. c. 24.</note> and the Seal thereof, who neither believing nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying,
have no effects thereof, nor grace of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant:
So some put on Christ only sacramentally, and others
to sanctification and salvation also.</p>
                  <q>
                     <pb n="135" facs="tcp:31222:79"/>
It is absurd and to no purpose to baptize any unto they know
not what:<note place="margin">Object. 28.</note> Such is Infants-Baptism; Therefore they are
absurdly and to no purpose baptized.</q>
                  <p>1. We answer: Circumcision was to <hi>Isaas</hi> and <hi>Evangelical</hi>
Ordinance and Seal of Gods Covenant of the same Grace
common to him and us; yet that being administred to him
at eight days old, he knew not what he was circumcised
to; yet was it neither in vain nor absurdly administred to
him.</p>
                  <p>2. Some mysterious things have been done to them, who
though of age, knew not for the present what was done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them; yet not absurdly, nor to no purpose; as when <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
feet were washed, <hi>Iohn</hi> 13. 7, &amp;c. Christ told him, <hi>What
I do, thou knowest not now</hi>—yet was it not absurdly, or to no
purpose done. 3. No circumcised Infants knew what was
done to them for present, yet was it to purpose done to all,
either to salvation, or further condemnation.</p>
                  <q>That Tenet and Practise,<note place="margin">Object. 29.</note> which being put, or supposed
Baptism, cannot be administred as <hi>John Baptist</hi> and the
Apostles administred it,<note place="margin">Mr. Tombes: exercit. arg. 3. sect. 16.</note> agreeth not with the Practice
of <hi>John Baptist</hi> and the Apostles: But the Tenent and
Practice of Infant-Baptism being put, Baptism cannot
be administred as <hi>John Baptist</hi> and the Apostles ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred
it; <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>We answer: Here is an <hi>Ignoratio elenchi,</hi> the argument
driving at that which is not in question. The question is not
whether <hi>Iohn B.</hi> and the Apostles did baptize Infants; for
in case they had not opportunity so to do, it follows not,
that when opportunity was, baptizing such agreed not with
their practice; no more then to have circumcised men of
years had not agreed with <hi>Moses</hi> Institution of Circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
because we never read that he ever did circumcise any
Jews of years.</p>
                  <p>2. The <hi>Minor</hi> can never be proved. How know you
that <hi>Iohn B.</hi> or the Apostles never baptized any Infants?
You have been often told, <hi>à non Scripto ad non factum</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
not: No man can certainly say, that <hi>Iohn B.</hi> and
the Apostles never baptized Infants: The contrary appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in that which hath been said.</p>

and good consequence.</p>
                  <p>2. If otherwise, you argue negatively from Scriptures in
respect of express terms. We further say: 1. That the like
reason might be urged against baptizing of women, and
administring the Lords Supper to them, there being no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
or particular precept <hi>in terminis</hi> for either; nor express
example of the latter, nor promise to it in all the Scripture:
And if you say women are comprehended in the general
precepts; we answer, so are Infants of believing Parents,
as parts of Families and Nations: If you say women are
admitted to the Communion, because Christ dyed for them
as well as men: We say so to; and that he as certainly dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for Infants. 2. The command for baptizing Infants, is
<hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. The examples, <hi>Acts 16 33. 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 16. And the
promise, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 39.</p>
                  <q>If Infant-Baptism be an Ordinance of Christ,<note place="margin">Object. 4.</note> then it is
expresly set down: But it is not expresly set down;
<hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
                  <p>We answer: 1. If the question be concerning the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:31222:80"/>
of Christ or his Disciples baptizing Infants; and
you would reason thus, They did never baptize Infants, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is not expresly written: We have often said, <hi>à non
scripto ad non factum, non valet argumentum:</hi> Christ and
his Apostles did many things which are not expresly writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>
                  <p>2. We may understand this word <hi>(Expresly)</hi> to signifie
either a writing <hi>in terminis;</hi> that is, so many words and syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lables
<hi>(Go and Baptize Infants)</hi> if you would have it so strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
understood, that it is not the Ordinance of <hi>Christ</hi> that
any should be baptized, but such as are so mentioned in
Scriptures; then you must also conclude, that the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism
of women is no Ordinance of Christ (and indeed
there might appear more colour of doubting concerning
their baptizing, who were not sealed under the Law, then
of male Infants which were) and then giving the <hi>Eucharist</hi>
to women must be no Ordinance of Christ; nay, baptizing
of men and women of ripe years, must then be no Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of Christ; for where can you shew us, where <hi>Christ
expresly</hi> said, <hi>Go and baptize men and women of ripe years?</hi>
Where can you shew us <hi>in terminis, Thou</hi> Thomas, John,
Andrew, <hi>&amp;c. shalt be baptized and saved?</hi> This you will
put upon necessary consequence, where you have no express
word: And why shall we not have the like liberty for <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptism?</hi>
Or we may understand this word <hi>(Expresly)</hi>
in a greater latitude, to import a general and implicite com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
in such terms and grounds, <hi>quibus positis, alia neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sariò

Infant-Baptism, where he said, without any limitation or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
to Infants, <hi>Go baptize all Nations:</hi> whereof In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants

                  </p>

seems you here do, for <hi>(in terminis)</hi> so many words and
syllables: We say from other instances, that your assertion
may appear false and erroneous: For 1. There is no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
place of <hi>Scripture</hi> which nameth three <hi>persons in the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:31222:81"/>
unity of the Deity,</hi> which yet we must believe; again, there is no
<hi>Express</hi> Precept for abrogating the <hi>Iewish Sabbath,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
observation of the <hi>Christian Sabbath,</hi> as hath been
noted.</p>
                  <q>If <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19.<note place="margin">Object. 5.</note> Christ gave Commission to teach those
whom they were to baptize; then not to baptize In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants:
But <hi>Matth</hi> 28. 19. he gave commission to teach
those they were to baptize: Therefore there he gave no
commission to baptize infants.</q>
                  <p>1. We answer: Your <hi>major</hi> is <hi>Amphibologicae:</hi> For it is
doubtful whether you affirm by <hi>(those whom they were to
baptize)</hi> all those, or only some of those: If you mean <hi>All,</hi>
your <hi>minor</hi> is false: For <hi>Christ</hi> gave them no commission to
teach Infants, as such, though he gave them commission to
baptize them into future faith and obedience: If you mean
thus, <hi>Christ</hi> gave commission, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19, 20. to teach
some of those whom they were to baptize; therefore <hi>he
gave them not Commission to baptize Infants:</hi> then the
<hi>Sequel</hi> of your <hi>major</hi> is lame, and cannot follow; for
though <hi>Christ</hi> there gave them commission to teach and
baptize the Parents first; it follows not thence, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he gave them not commission to baptize their Infants;
but contrarywise he therefore gave them commission to
baptize the Infants of such: For the Parents being taught
and sealed, entituled their children to the Seal of the same
Promise and Covenant of God, which is joyntly to sealed
Parents and their Children, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. and so Christ com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them to teach those who were capable of doctrine,
and only to baptize them who were capable of Baptism on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as Infants.</p>
                  <p>2. Christ not repeating there an exact copy of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
formerly given them at sundry times, and on sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
occasions (for there he mentioneth not any particular
heads of doctrine or discipline, nor so much as the <hi>Eucharist)</hi>
but to those things relateth in general, <hi>verse 20. Teaching
them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you—</hi>
whereof he nameth the two first and and most usual things,
<hi>—Teaching and Baptizing,</hi> for the making of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:31222:81"/>
and gathering a Church of all Nations: So that
he nameth not here the matter or subject of baptism in
particular; but saith in general—<hi>Baptizing them &amp;c.
Teaching them to observe all,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">See answer to Obi. 1. num. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now although children
cannot be first taught before they are baptized, as such,
as their Parents might and ought to be, yet might they
be first baptized, and in due time taught, as Christ com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.
And it is here to be noted, That children of
sealed Parents were called Disciples, and so accounted in
both Testaments: See <hi>Acts 15. 10. Iohn 9. 28. We are
Moses Disciples,</hi>—said the Jews: Now the only thing
which entred them into the School of <hi>Moses,</hi> or denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
them <hi>Moses Disciples,</hi> was their <hi>Circumcision</hi> in
their infancy, which obliged them coming to years, to
the observation of the whole Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 3. delivered by
<hi>Moses.</hi> So Baptism of Infants doth not <hi>anticipate</hi> profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Christianity, but oblige unto it in due time; and
therefore is Baptism a sign that the baptised professeth
himself a Disciple of <hi>Christ,</hi> who appointed it as a mark and
cognizance of his Disciples: Baptism makes Infants Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
in the first form of his School, into which they are
thereby entred, though not actually for the present taught,
because they are not yet capable of Doctrine: Yet so is
fulfilled in Infants-Baptism that same <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> (in
<hi>Christs</hi> commission, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19.) <hi>Make Disciples, baptizing
them &amp;c.</hi> and children of Believers are counted Disciples,
<hi>Acts 15. 10. Why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck
of the DISCIPLES?</hi> What yoke? Why <hi>Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;</hi>
as appears <hi>Verse</hi> 1. Now those upon whom the false
Teachers would have laid this yoke, are called by the
Apostle <hi>DISCIPLES:</hi> and that yoke of <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision</hi>
was put upon children most commonly, in respect
of whom the <hi>Proselytes</hi> were very few: And there is no
great doubt but that those false Masters who would have
grown Disciples circumcised, as much, at least, urged, that

                  <q>If the children of Israel had only a ceremonial holiness,<note place="margin">Obj. 6.</note>
then the pretence from circumcision to baptism of Infants

                  <p>The <hi>minor</hi> being denyed, was thus attempted to be

                  <p>If the Covenant <hi>Gen. 17. 7. &amp;c.</hi> was only for the land of

                  <p>We answer, 1 If by <hi>ceremonial,</hi> you mean <hi>federal holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
as appertaining (by Gods Promise and Covenant with

a ceremonial holiness; not because Gods covenant held
forth no more then external and temporal things unto
them; but because through unbelief they apprehended no
more. But if the proposition be universal, as also relating to
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:31222:83"/>
the chief and best part of <hi>Israel,</hi> to wit, the Elect, for whose

the Apostle gathereth that matrimonial conjunction
between a believer and an unbeliever, is holy, because the
denomination and estimate being from the better part, their
children are within the covenant of God, by an argument
from the effect to the cause.</p>
                  <p>3. The Apostle discoursed not there of civil Policie, but of
conscience; and how could it satisfie any Christians consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to take an argument from the civil laws of any of the
Nations? it is notorious that among those, many things were
established by their laws, which a Christians conscience
would, and must abhor: yea, even such divorces without
the ease of adultery, as were in civil respects tolerated
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:31222:86"/>
by <hi>Moses,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Beza in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.</note> for the hardness of the Jews hearts, excused not
the offenders conscience, though that permissive law would
bear him out before men?</p>
                  <p>4 When the Apostle saith <hi>the unbelieving husband is
sanctified in the wife;</hi> if any ask, what wife? we cannot say
in a wife as she is only civilly legitimate; for so far that
husband hath as good and evident a ground of sanctification
on his part and in himself without any accession of privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
from his wife; for he must needs be as lawfully her
husband as she is his wife: we can therefore no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
rationally answer, then, a <hi>believing wife:</hi> and so on
the other side. Now seeing the Apostle puts it on a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
priviledge, which is sometimes in the man when he is a
believer, and his wife is not; and sometimes in the wife, if
she be a believer, and her husband is not so; it appears that
the foundation of comfort here intended by the Apostle, is
laid in faith peculiar but to one of the two, and not in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonial
legitimacie common and equal to both.</p>
                  <p>5 Faith which rendreth us acceptable to God in Christ,
purifieth us, and all estates and possessions to us: that san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifieth
marriage, not marriage it; that uniteth us by one
Spirit to Christ, and is therefore far more excellent then
marriage, which uniteth man and woman only in one flesh:
faith therefore gives our children a denomination and right
to the seals of the covenant as they are holy,<note place="margin">Tit. 1. 15.</note> not marriage,
which though civilly lawful, may yet be impious before God;
as where one puts away his wife for less then adultery and
marrieth another,<note place="margin">Mat. 19. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </note> or another man marrieth her so put
away: it is therefore the faith and Church-priviledge of
parents which thus denominateth children holy.</p>
                  <p>6 The Apostle could not here mean legitimacie of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:
for that can neither sanctifie them, nor entitle them
to the seal of Gods covenant; neither is sanctification here
or in any other place of Scripture taken otherwise then for
separating some way from some thing prophane or impious.
So persons, times, places, &amp;c. are said to be sanctified,
which legitimation cannot do: neither can (holy) neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
imply <hi>(no bastard)</hi> for some holy men have been
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:31222:87"/>
such; neither can <hi>(no bastard)</hi> conclude a man holy. The
children of infidels, and aliens from the covenant of God,
born in lawful wedlock, are legitimate and no bastards;
and yet as such, far from holy: and bastardie, though the
effect and product of foul sin of parents, and the childs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delible
dishonour before men, yet maketh them not such
as belong not to the covenant of God, as appears in <hi>Pharez</hi>
and <hi>Zarah, Gen. 38. 18, 29, 30. Iephtah, Iudg. 11. 1, 2. &amp;c.</hi> it
must needs be therefore, that the Apostle in that term of
<hi>holy,</hi> signified some thing peculiar to those that are within
the Church of God, and not communicable to children
of Infidels,<note place="margin">

                  <p>7 We must consider that legitimacie of children (which

<hi>Iudas, Demas,</hi> and <hi>Simon Magus;</hi> all these shew that

God abhorreth, and on whom Christ denounced so many
woes, and excludeth believers Infants from the seal of Gods
covenant, in which God himself testifieth children of such
are, and whom Christ embraced in his sacred arms, testifying
that of such is the kingdom of heaven.</p>
                  <p>3 Shew us a rule in all the New Testament <hi>in terminis</hi>
(as you require of us for Infant-baptism) for baptizing
only persons of ripe years to make profession of their faith,
and at once (if you can, set an end to this unhappy contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
which hath so much troubled the Church) put it
out of doubt that none may be baptized untill there be an
appearance of their faith and repentance; or give us some
infallible proof, that all those whom you baptize are indeed
and certainly belonging to the kingdom of heaven: nay,
shew us any necessary consequence for the exclusion of our
Infants from baptism: what? because those of years pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
their faith, and confessed their sins? therefore In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
who cannot so do, may not be baptized? it follows
not: nay, yet further, were there an express precept, <hi>if

no more exclude Infants from their right to baptism, then
that which the Apostle saith (as hath been noted) <hi>if any

                     <hi>neither should he eat,</hi> excludeth them
from their right to be fed. To conclude, we shew you an
infallible word of Christ, that Infants belong to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of heaven; and therefore the <hi>appearance</hi> (from those
words of Christ, and the covenant of God with believing
parents and their children) is as good and certain that
the kingdom of heaven belongs to the Infants of constant
professors whom we baptize, as any profession of new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts
can shew; for men and women may and often do
deceive men, who know not the heart, or future conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of professors, whatsoever they now seem or say: but
Christ who knows all things, yea the secrets of every heart,
and ends of all that are or shall be, could not be deceived
in so judging of Infants.<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 19.</note>

parent, as such, being as well known to be converted, as
any new proselyte is or can be known to be converted;

                  <p>4 The interest of sealing into the covenant of grace de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth
not on the sealed persons worthiness or unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
sexe, age, or condition, but upon God the author and
free appointer thereof: so circumcision was one and the
same in the external seal, to the elect and reprobate, Infant
or Proselyte of years. The commandment of God did not
put any difference, but equally enjoined it to all sorts of
males within the pale of <hi>Israel:</hi> he said not circumcise on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
believers, the penitent, &amp;c. (though in pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sons of years,
that was to be understood) but circumcise every male child
the eighth day; when 'tis sure they could neither actually
believe, repent, nor make any <hi>appearance</hi> thereof; as then the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:31222:89"/>
external seal was one and the same, though the effect in the
sealed was variable; so is it in baptism; the secret unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
or <hi>Apostacie</hi> of the receiver foreseen only by God, did
not make them uncapable of the seal; therefore man admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string,
was to do his part according to the general command
of God, and to leave the particular success and effect to
God, and so is it in baptism.</p>
                  <p>5 Though unbelievers who reject the word of God, may
not, as such, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e baptized; yet Infants, who at most may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
but <hi>negatively</hi> unbelievers, cannot be included in that rule
which excludeth contemners, seeing they have faith as they
have reason, in the seed, not in the fruit, in the root, though
not in the leaf; in some inward operation, though not in any
o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tward expression, as <hi>Tilenus</hi> cited by the learned Dr. <hi>Feat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
well observes.</p>
                  <p>6 None are required to manifest their faith and repentance
before baptism, but such as having the use of reason, have
been taught and instructed in the same; for God requireth no
impossibilities in respect of the abilities which himself ever
gave: so that in common reason, all texts of Scripture which
require confession of faith, repentance, &amp;c. are to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
of such as have the use of reason and tongue, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they are enabled so to do.</p>

an <hi>amphibologie</hi> in the <hi>major, believers</hi> being either such only
in profession and bearing the external seal of the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

for the promise of Gods covenant was to all <hi>Israel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
as being the seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> within that covenant; although
many of them through unbelief obtained not remission of
sins and eternal life held out to them in the same:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 5.</note> which
made not the promise of none effect to them who believed;<note place="margin">Heb. 4. 2.</note>
and many unbelieving parents had and have believing chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:
but a covenanted Parents unbelief barreth not his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
born within the Church from the external seal of the
covenant: so that the promise did belong to them though
their Parents had secretly been unbelievers and impious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
much more, seeing they so expressed and professed their
faith, repentance, and care to be saved.</p>
                  <q>If those children <hi>Act.</hi>

neglect of their duty, or any other intercident obstructions

who were not within the covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi>) and
indeed the whole mystical body of Christ,<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 7.</note> is the spiritual seed

covenanted Parents to be a part, who acknowledge Christ to
be their Saviour. See <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 28. and that out of him and
his body the Church, is no salvation. So that by the way we
may note, that to exclude Christian Infants from being a
part of Christs visible Church in general, is to exclude them
from the ordinary state and way to salvation: and so to
deny them to be <hi>Abrahams</hi> spiritual seed, is to exclude them
from the same, and to leave them to an extraordinary means
thereto; in which some <hi>Pagans, Turks,</hi> and obstinate <hi>Iews</hi>
&amp;c. by the mercie of God, (illuminating &amp; converting them
to the faith of Christ by extraordinary means) may be saved:
and this is to suppose Infants of Christian Parents as bad as

without hope</hi> for their deceased Infants, they cannot have
sound hope without faith, nor faith without a promise or

their children, as that <hi>Gen. 17. 7. Act. 2. 39. Luk.</hi> 18. 16, 17. &amp;c.
Now to deny childrens interest herein, or that they are the
<hi>spiritual seed of Abraham,</hi> is to leave afflicted Parents hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
of their childrens salvation, in that by such an an unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
&amp; impious tenet, Parents must not believ those comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
promises belong to their children; and that God will
not so much as by an external seal, assure them that he is by
covenant a God unto their Infants. Nor can we think that
ever any were saved ordinarily, if at all, touching whom God
never made any promise, neither in respect of internal and
saving faith, nor so much as in respect of external right to
sealing thereto: so that to avoid this, we must say, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian

therefore no man may forbid water, or the outward admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
for the baptism of Infants. The reason of the <hi>major</hi> is
that all they who are partakers of the grace both signified
&amp; exhibited in baptism, have right to the sign and sacrament
thereof, and therefore may not be barred from it; for that
were to withstand God, <hi>Act.</hi> 11. 17. In reason where God
hath bestowed the grace signified, man may not deny the
signifying element; and in common right, the apparent heirs
are unjustly denied the deeds and evidences whereby that
right is assured upon them: for these are a part of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance,
and ought by right to follow the same: moreover
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:31222:93"/>
'tis impious to divide that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> God hath join'd, the sign from
the thing signified; as they do, who allow children, grace,
remission of sins and salvation by Christ, and yet deny them
baptism into Christ; they will yeild them the Jewels, but
not the Cabinet, the Treasure, but not the Purse.</p>
                  <p>6 All that are capable of the initiatorie seal of future faith,
ought to be baptized: but Infants are capable thereof,
therfore they ought to be baptized. So under the law Infants
were capable of circumcision, the seal of their future faith: &amp;
our Infants have no less capacitie thereof then they had.</p>
                  <p>7 All they to whom Gods covenant of Grace extends, are
to receive the initiatory seal thereof (for sealing of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
respectively, is a part thereof, <hi>Gen. 17. 10, 11. Mark</hi>
16. 16.) but Gods covenant of Grace in Christ extends to
Infants of covenanted persons: therefore Infants ought to
receive the initiatory seal of the covenant, which is baptism.
The assumption is proved from <hi>Act. 2. 38, 39. Be baptized ev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of you—for the remission of sins—for the promise is unto
you, and to your children.</hi> What promise? that upon which
the Covenant was sealed to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his seed, the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful:
and when, where, or how have Infants of Christians
forfeited their right to the seal, who as such, cannot forfeit?</p>
                  <p>8 If circumcision and baptism were for substance, both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective
seals of the same covenant of God in Christ, then
those sorts of men who were capable of the one, are capable
of the other: but circum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ision and baptism were for substance
both respective seals of the same covenant of God in Christ,
therefore those sorts of men (to wit, Infants as well as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of years) who were capable of circumcision, are capable
of baptism. The <hi>major</hi> may appear in that God never made
any covenant of grace but only in Christ, and the same Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
was preached to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and he believed in the same
Christ, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 8. add hereto, there is the same efficient pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
cause, to wit, God making a covenant with his, and
appointing the respective seals thereof: the same necessity
on the receivers part, original sin in Infants, who have
therefore as much need of regeneration and admission
into the covenant of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the law, and there is the same power and efficacie of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost still remaining; otherwise Gods grace in the New
Testament, and covenant in Christ exhibited, should be
more restrained, and of less latitude, then it was in the Old,
under that severe Schoolmaster <hi>the Law;</hi> and, which were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
to affirm, then Christs coming into the world should be
so much disvantageous to believers, as that the Gospel should
take away the seal of Gods covenant of grace from our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
which the Law allowed them under the severity therof.</p>
                  <p>No part or condition of the covenant by God appointed
for remission of sins and salvation, may be withheld by man
from those who have right to the covenant and promise of
God, under severe punishment: but the initiatory Sacrament,
Baptism, now is a part or condition of the covenant by God
appointed for remission of sins and salvation, whereto Infants
have right: therefore it may not be withheld from such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
as are within the covenant, and have right thereto and
to the promise of God, See <hi>Exod. 4. Luk. 3. 3. Act.</hi> 2. 38,

Christ commanded Ministers to baptize <hi>all nations</hi> without

So far was it from diminishing, or contracting the grace

much worse, as being less testified then that under the
Law. Add hereto, that the coming of Christ (which set
an end to Legal ceremonies, and appointed Baptism)
diminished not the grace of his Father in the Signs and
Dispensations thereof, making it more dark, or less testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by a Seal towards those who are within the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
of Grace; but rather encreased or communicated
it more clearly, and therein it is a better Covenant,

the Mediator,</hi> he is the same under the Law and Gospel;
but in respect of the exhibition of things promised and
shadowed out in the Law, and clearer manifestation of
Gods grace and truth in Christ. Now they who deny In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
of believers the initiatory seal of Gods Covenant, as
much as in them lieth, diminish the grace of God; and
make the Covenant seem worse by Christs coming, in that
they diminish the comfortable assurance of our childrens

them, if they may not so much as be marked with the

to preach, as being appointed the <hi>Doctor of the Gentiles,</hi> first
to be taught, and then respectively to be baptized, yet
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:31222:97"/>
it is manifest that the Dispensation of Baptism, the seal of
the Gospel, and Covenant of God in Christ, went along in
charge with preaching of the same, and was committed to
the Apostles,<note place="margin">Matth. 28. 19, 20.</note> and all <hi>Ministers</hi> their Successors, and <hi>so woe</hi>

their sin to bespatter the <hi>Church</hi> with impious calumnies: It

belong also the signs and seals thereof, except in case of some
apparent condition making an evident exception (as want of
ability to examine themselves, barreth Infants from the holy
Eucharist) But the thing signified by Baptism belongs to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,
and there is no apparent condition making any evident
exception to bar them from it; therefore Baptism belongeth
to them. The things signified by Baptism, are, that we are
thereby received into Gods favour, for the blood of Christ
shed for us, to binde us to a sincere obedience to faith, and
endeavour to newness of life; Gods promise of grace and
mercy in Christ, marking us for sheep of his pasture; our put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on Christ, regeneration, washing from our sins, justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
&amp; salvation by Christ; these things belong to all the elect,
whereof Infants of Believers are a very considerable part:
And these things are held forth in Baptism as things signified
in the sign by God appointed to all receivers sacramentally,

<hi>Ionah</hi>'s being in the Whales belly, was a type of Christs bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial

may shew the vanity of stretching types and signs to every
fancy of <hi>Hectic braines;</hi> and now deal ingenuously, what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
or warrant have you to wrest this similitude to what you
please? in those <hi>similes</hi> which are most apt, there may be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
disconveniences found: Or what commission can you
dream of, that gives you authority to draw this alledged

therefore do not at all bind us to any external, or literal sense
or observance in the maner of baptizing; &amp; if the similitude
must fully hold, some might possibly reason thus; as Christ
was first dead and buried, and rose again the third day, so we
must first be dead and buried, and then be baptized, and rise
with Christ a third time (<hi>Marcion,</hi> that old pernicious here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
held, that one might be three times baptized) or they
might infer that we must not rise up out of the water into
which we are dipt, until the third day: but how absurd such
inferences are, none can be ignorant.</p>
                  <p>3. The alledged scripture concludes not the manner of our
baptism, but the effects thereof; not how the water should be
applied, or in what maner we should be baptized, whether by
sprinkling, washing or dipping; but how we ought to live who
are baptized; that sin should henceforth have no more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
over us, then if we were dead; that we should so live to
righteousness, and bringing forth fruits thereof, as being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted
into Christ, and so no more living our own life, but
the holy life of Christ.</p>

as Christ was buried in his baptism; but, <hi>into the likeness of his

                  <p>5. The argument here drawn to prove necessity of immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
is a <hi>fallicia accidentis;</hi> a reasoning from the the substance
to the accident. Suppose thus, <hi>We must be baptized into the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude
of Christs death: But he was covered and rose again;</hi>
ergo, <hi>We must be covered with water that we may be raised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
&amp;c. Non sequitur:</hi> his being covered in the rocky vault,
was but a circumstance, as was his lying covered to the third
day: therefore it can be no more here concluded, that we must
be like Christ in being covered with water in baptism, then
that we must lie under water three days and nights in our ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism,
because he lay so long in his grave; for why should one
circumstance or accident be concluded, rather then another?</p>
                  <p>6. If the similitude must be so strictly urged, it will be rather
for us. <hi>Christ</hi> was not thrown down, prone, with his face down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
(as they use to dive their disciples) but honorably em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balmed,
and decently laid in a new Sepulchre; and we use so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
to bury our dead with their faces upward, &amp; sprinkle
dust and earth upon them; and in such decent posture we ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptize
Infants, by putting our sprinkling water on them, or by

which manner of purification they too superstitiously and

                  <p>As for the second clause of our <hi>minor</hi> proposition, we
appeal to Scriptures, whether there be any express example

                  <p>2 In the Lords Supper the efficacie of the Sacrament is
not in the quantitie of the element: a little bread, therein,
is as good and effectual as a whole loaf: so here, it is not (as
hath been said) in the quantitie of the element, but in the
ordinance of God, and operation of his Spirit: Now herein
Christ never gave any precept concerning the <hi>quantum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

the Word and the Element make the Sacrament; and a
few drops sprinkled, are as truly water as all <hi>Iordan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. If Baptism in the type thereof were administred by
God by sprinkling, then it is lawfully and effectually so
to be administred by man in the truth (for in the main
Analogy the truth must answer the type) But Baptism in
the type was administred by sprinkling (infants as well as
persons of years<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Cloud, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 2. Therefore Baptism may lawfully and
effectually be administred by sprinkling of water.</p>
                  <p>4. That administration of Baptism whereby Christ
cleanseth his Church, is lawfull and effectuall. But <hi>Christ

and it is improbable that he had any such store and
convenience of water in his house, as to dip himself and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
or that they went out to some river at such a season;
neither was it probable that three thousand added to the
Church in one day, durst in those times when <hi>Christians</hi>
were so eagerly persecuted, go publickly with the Apostles
to the poole of <hi>Bethesda, Siloam,</hi> or the brook <hi>Cedron,</hi> or
any like place to be doused: more probably they were
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:31222:106"/>
baptized by washing or sprinkling with water, as they had
private accommodation thereto: nor could so many in one
day have been baptized by a few Apostles, if all had been
baptized by dipping</p>
                  <p>6. If immersion were simply necessary, and of the
<hi>Essence</hi> of Baptism, then it might not be dispensed withall
in case <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for the comfort and peace of his afflicted conscience,
which were extream uncharitableness, which belongs not
to any Ordinance of God. Therefore it cannot be sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply

                  <p>7 That which can neither be proved by example of
Christ, <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> or any of the Apostles baptizing, nor
by any precept of Christ concerning the same, is not essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
or simply necessary to baptism: but dipping or dowsing
i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> baptism, can neither be proved by example, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or
any precept of Christ concerning the same: therefore dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or dowsing is not essential, or simply necessary to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism:
and indeed were there to be found in Scripture any
example hereof, without a precept to lay the same univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
upon the Ordinance, it were not binding, as hath been
proved from Christs administring the communion with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leavened
bread, after supper in an upper room to twelve
men only and no women. So that if that which you can
never prove, should be granted you, that <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> and
Christs disciples, did then and there baptize by dipping; yet
it would not follow that we ought to baptize in the like and
no other manner. In the infancie of the Church they had
not <hi>Baptisteries</hi> or <hi>Churches</hi> as we have; there was a kind of
necessitie for them as they met with occasions, to make use
of waters as they could find them in rivers or sources; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it cannot be proved that they dipt: nor could it conclude
our Antagonists pretended necessitie, if it were supposed.</p>
                  <p>8 Whatsoever was or is essential to baptism, or simply
necessary thereto, is mentioned in some clear example or

come to years to be taught and to make profession of their

Infant-baptism is void, and to be esteemed no bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism.</p>

dye in their infancy, it is certain that they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
by the Sacrament, without the ministry of the
word preached unto them, whereof they are not capable,
who yet without regeneration, could not enter into the

live to be capable of teaching, and so receive the word, as
that it begets in him actual faith, repentance and obedience
to God, then that word is as <hi>Sincere milk,</hi> to nourish and
confirm, not to regenerate, but to promote the degrees of
regeneration, producing that faith and the fruits thereof
sowed in baptism, to a clearer and more evident maturity.
So was it in <hi>Isaac,</hi> who was first regenerate by the seal of
the righteousness of faith, which was after he came to years
nourished and confirmed by the word preached unto him:

                  <q>The spiritual death to sin, is by many acts of regeneration,<note place="margin">Object. 3.</note>

that we are baptized into remission of sins, which being
daily, we have need of daily remission, and therefore of
Baptism.</q>
                  <p>We answer: 1. That dying to sin, and rising to new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of life, are the certain effects of regeneration; and
therefore it may conclude, that where these are, and their
several acts appear, there undoubtedly is Regeneration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
But it can no more conclude divers Regenerations, then the
divers acts of a living man, can prove that he had several
Generations or Births, because these prove that he
liveth.</p>
                  <p>2. Our need of daily pardon for our daily sins may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
our daily need of repentance,<note place="margin">Matth. 6.</note> as our Saviour taught
us; but it concludes not any necessity to iterate our Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,
but rather the contrary, because the Covenant of
God once sealed to us in Baptism (for the free remission
of all our sins,<note place="margin">Ier. 31. 34.</note> through the inestimable and never dying-merit
of Christs death, into which we are implanted by
Baptism) is unchangably perpetual; and the condition of
our comfortable assurance of pardon, cannot be iteration
of our Baptism, but renewing of our repentance, and
amendment of our lives, which demonstrate our faith to
be lively. See <hi>Ier. 3. 12, 13. Ezek.</hi> 16. 60. Nor doth that
hinder which some object; Some hypocrites receive the seal,
therefore they have need to receive it again, that they may
obtain the fruits thereof, which believing they shall have:
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:31222:109"/>
It follows not, that they ought to be baptized again, but
that they ought to be sincere, and to repent of their hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie,
and then the seal formerly received, shall be
effectual for them to Remission of sins and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <q>Spiritual death in sin, is by many acts; and Regeneration
is a rising again from the same;<note place="margin">Object. 4.</note> which in the regenerate,
who also often fall, must and is often to be iterated;
therefore Regeneration may and must be iterated, and
consequently, so must Baptism, the Laver of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</q>
                  <p>We answer; 1. The acts of Regeneration are many,
but that proves not pluralities of Regenerations, more
then many acts of life prove many lives of one and the
same person, as we said.</p>
                  <p>2. As many wounds, or other concurrent causes of death,
conclude not many deaths of one and the same person, so
'tis here; many sins wound and spiritually destroy the
soul, yet are there not more deaths then lives of one man;
for death is a privation of life: So that our often falling
into sin, concludes only a need of frequent renewing our
repentance; and hath been shewed.</p>
                  <q>That which the Apostles of Christ did,<note place="margin">Object. 5.</note> that we may do
in the work of the Ministry: But they rebaptized,
as may appear <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 4, 5. therefore we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptize.</q>
                  <p>We answer. 1. This main argument which the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists</hi>
have, is built, as the rest, upon a meer mistake of
that Scripture <hi>S. Luke</hi> thus relateth, <hi>Then,</hi> said <hi>Paul, Iohn
verily baptized with the baptism of repentance; saying unto
the people, that they should believe on him which should come
after him, that is, on Christ Iesus. When they heard this</hi> (to
wit, that which <hi>Iohn</hi> spake) <hi>they</hi> (that is, the people men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<hi>verse</hi> 4. which heard those words of <hi>Iohn B.) were
baptized;</hi> that is, by <hi>Iohn B.</hi> or his Disciples, not by <hi>Paul;</hi>
for he is only said, <hi>verse</hi> 6. to have laid his hands upon
them, that they might be confirmed in their receiving the
extraordinary gifts of the Holy Ghost, of which those
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:31222:109"/>

time, <hi>so much as heard,</hi> verse 2.</p>
                  <p>2. There was no difference in substance or signification

                  <p>We answer: 1. There is in Scripture express command
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:31222:110"/>
for often administring and receiving of the Lords Supper,
1 <hi>Cor. 11. 24. This do in remembrance of me—As often

death till he come:</hi> shew us any one such warrant for rebap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing,
and this controversie is at an end.</p>
                  <p>2. The Lords Supper proposeth not any new Covenant
with God, but confirmeth that to us, which he made with
us in our baptism: But baptism is the <hi>Initiatory Seal</hi> of our
entring into Covenant with God (as it was in circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion)
which Covenant is but one.</p>
                  <p>3. The vertue and efficacy of baptism in the elect, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth
it self to the whole life of the regenerate, and is,
as it were, a fountain of living waters, perpetually running
to cleanse away the pollutions of sin; so that there need
not new or more baptisms, but a daily renewing of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
to which we were in our covenanting with God,
at first baptized. As <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith, after baptism there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
no remedy but true repentance.</p>
                  <q>Cyprian and the Councel of <hi>Carthage,</hi> held, that those

the Church, ought to be rebaptized.</q>
                  <p>We answer: 1. The question being proposed in the first
Councel of <hi>Carthage,</hi> Whether those who were once bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,

which is not to be found out of the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi> The

and not to be iterated. So that indeed, neither <hi>Cyprian,</hi>
nor the rest of that Councel, did maintain rebaptizing, but
held that there could be no true or valid baptism out of
the <hi>Catholick Church;</hi> or that it was not baptism which He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks
administred. Against rebaptizing, <hi>Cyprian</hi> speaks

                  <p>3 There is not in all the New <hi>Testament</hi> any one precept
or example for rebaptizing; therfore it ought not to be done:
the constant judgment and practice of the Church of Christ
being to the contrary: it is neither commanded in the institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of baptism, nor in any Scripture admitted: nor is it tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
by any necessary consequence, as is the contrary. <hi>Iohns</hi>
baptism and Christs were one, whatever Jesuites pretend to
the contrary: <hi>Apollos</hi> knew only <hi>Iohns</hi> baptism, <hi>Act.</hi> 18. 25.
that is, the <hi>doctrine of Iohn Baptist;</hi> we read not that <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los</hi>
or any other mentioned in Scripture, was rebaptized; no
not any of <hi>Iohns</hi> Disciples coming to Christ and his magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,
which had surely been done, had <hi>Christs</hi> baptism and
<hi>Iohns</hi> been different in substance; and had it been done, we
should have had in Scripture either some express proof for
the same, or something so layed down, that we might by
good consequence have gathered the same, which nowhere
appeareth: but (as hath been said) the Apostle recalleth
penitent sinners once baptized, unto the comfort of that
which they had once received in baptism, 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 11.
1 Cor. 12. 13. &amp; Gal.</hi> 3. 27.</p>
                  <p>Circumcision was only once administred, but was perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
and everlasting; and under the Law sinners were to
return unto the Lord by true repentance;<note place="margin">Gen. 17. 7. <gap reason="foreign">

<hi>Isa.</hi> 55. and the principal cause why circumcision was not
iterated, was Gods divine ordinance and institution; the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
<hi>character</hi> was secondary: on Gods part it ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
sure, to which after their forsaking his covenant,
into which they had been once sealed, he recalled them not
to a susception of a new, or the same seal iterated, but only
to repentance, as to humble them, so to shew that the fault
and failing of the fruits and effects thereof (which should
have appeared in their newness of life) was wholly on their
parts, not on Gods, who is unchangeable and the same for
ever. So hath he appointed it in our sins after baptism.

(saith he) is the Cross; for therein our old man is cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with him. <q>Again, we have been planted together
in the likeness of his death; as therefore Christ may not be
crucified again (for that were to put him again to open
shame;) so neither may we be baptized again: for if
death have no more dominion over him; if he be risen
(in his resurrection) a conqueror over death, &amp;c. and
should again be crucified, then all these things were meer
fables and mockeries: therefore he that rebaptizeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
doth again crucifie him. But what is crucifying again?
As Christ died on the Cross, so do we in baptism, not in
the flesh, but to sin—therefore there may be no second
washing: for if there be, there may be a third, and a fourth;
for the first is <hi>made void by the second, and that by another,

                  <p>Where there are all the essential parts of baptism rightly
administred according to the commission given by Christ to
his Apostles, there baptism cannot be made void or no true
baptism, by any thing accidental, circumstantial, or less
then essential, neither expresly nor by any necessary conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
any where in holy Scripture forbidden. But in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing
of Infants of Church-priviledged Parents, by sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kling
or washing with water, in the name of the Father,
and the Son, and the holy Ghost, there are all the essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:31222:115"/>
parts of baptism, according to Christs commission given
to the Apostles, (to wit, the Element and the Word which
constitute the Sacrament.) Therefore that their baptism is
not, neither can be made void, or no true baptism, by, or in
respect of Infant-age, or of only washing or sprinkling them
with water (which are things circumstantial, accidental, less
then essential, and no where expresly, or by necessary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
forbidden in holy Scripture.) So that whatever
Anabaptists pretend in their eager pursuit of their opinion,
that they do not rebaptize, supposing that there preceded
no essential or true baptism in regard of the persons being
baptized in their Infancie, or because they fancie dipping
the whole body to be essential to baptism, and so necessary,
that without it they think there can be no true baptism,
(neither of which have any ground in Scripture) and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
Christ is the Saviour of every age, sex, and condition;
therefore male and female, aged and Infants have right to
the seal, as hath been shewed; it highly concerneth them
seriously to consider how dangerous a thing it is, upon a
mere opinion to pull off the seals of their Disciples salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
under pretence of putting on a new (unwarrantable)
seal, to renounce their Saviour, whom they put on in their
lawful baptism, at least sacramentally; to make more bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisms
then faiths and Saviours, into the similitude of whose
death and resurrection, all Christians are baptized; and to
crucifie again to themselves the Son of God, and to put him
to open shame. Alas, they discern not Satans mischievous
Legerdemain, who like a cunning finger-jugler, hereby takes
from them the true seal of redemption and salvation by
Christ, put on all his who are baptized, by pretending and
seeming to put them on a new, better, or more perfect one.</p>
