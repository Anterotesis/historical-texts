            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> MATTHEW POOL,
Author of that Elaborate Work, Sinopsis Critticorum.
His Late Sayings a little before his Death:
Concerning the most Material Points of the Popish Party; Charged against the Protestants; Wherein the
Desperate Tenets of Popish Jesuitical Principles are Detected and Sollidly Censured. For the Settlement of all
Real Professors, and Practical Opposers of those Damnable Delusions, in few words to the Wise.</head>
            <head type="sub">He Dyed the 12th. of this Instant Stilo Nova, at Amsterdam:</head>
            <p>1. THe Felicity of <hi>Protestant Professors,</hi> is, that
they are not only Permitted, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted
by their Ministers, not to take
Matters of Salvation upon trust; but to search the
Scriptures concerning Truths delivered.</p>
            <p>2. Whilst Unhappy <hi>Papists</hi> are oblieged to their
Implicit Faith to follow their blind Guides, and
must believe all they say; it's a plain sign that their
Gold is Adulterate because they dare not suffer it to
come to the Touch-Stone.</p>
            <p>3. The <hi>Romish</hi> Churches Infallibility is, that one
Neck is their strongest hold; all the rest are but the
Payring of their Nails, and cutting the Hair, which
will quickly grow again; but if this fails all falls;
Wound them here and it goes to their heart.</p>
            <p>4. Christ's Prayer for the Perseverance of Faith,
makes him Infallible for whom Christs Prays, then
all Elect and Persevering Believers are Infallible;
The Consequence thus appears from <hi>Iohn 17. I
Pray not for these alone, but for them also which shall
believe on me through their word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. And there is not one Persevering Christian in
the World, but owes his Perseverance to the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
Care, and Intercession of Christ: Hence they
are said to be preserved in Christ Jesus, <hi>Iude</hi> 1. 7.</p>
            <p>6. The Infallibility of <hi>Popes</hi> and Counsels hath no
Foundation in the Sacred Writ.</p>
            <p>7. Every Champion of God's Truth is a Pillar of
the Truth, but not Infallible.</p>
            <p>8. Let me see that <hi>Papist</hi> that will give it under
his Hand, that every one with whom the Spirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bides
as a Comforter, is Infallible.</p>
            <p>9. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> stands upon four Pillars:
<list>
                  <item>1. Authority of Scriptures.</item>
                  <item>2. Tradition of Fathers.</item>
                  <item>3. Infallibility of Councils.</item>
                  <item>4. And the <hi>POPE.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Which Absurdity the <hi>Iesuits</hi> thus Heal: That it
is no more Absurd that Scripture should lean upon
the Churches Authority, and the Church on Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Scripture, than that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist
should give Testimony to Christ, and Christ to him
again: or that the Old Testament should be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by the New, and the New Testament by the
Old.</p>
            <p>10. But the Four before mentioned, are Reduct
to Two.
<list>
                  <item>1. To Scripture.</item>
                  <item>2. To the <hi>POPE.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Which must prove one another.
<list>
                  <item>1. There is no solid and sufficient ground for me
to believe the Scriptures, but the Testimony of the
<hi>Pope,</hi> say the <hi>Papists.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. There is no solid and sufficient ground for me
to believe the Authority and Infallibility of the <hi>Pope,</hi>
but the Testimony of the Scriptures.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>11. By all which it is clear there is no Solid foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
for a <hi>Papist's</hi> Faith, nor Proof of the <hi>Popes</hi>
Infallibility, which they so pretend to.</p>
            <p>12. Hence Note, That those that Contemn and
forsake Faithful Pastors, are easily Betrayed into the
Hands of <hi>Romish</hi> Priests; Hence it concerns all
Protestants, with Fear and Reverence, to behold the
just Judgement of God upon Unsettled and Unstable
Christians, and such as are given to Change.</p>
            <p>13. And as we have many Woful Instances of
poor deluded Souls, that having wandred from Party
to Party, from Opinion to Opinion, have at last
been Swallowed up, some in the Gulph of Down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
<hi>Atheism;</hi> and others whom the Wantonness
of Opinion hath betrayed to <hi>Popish</hi> Impostures.</p>
            <p>14. The Supream and truly Infallible Judge of all
Controversies, Is God and Christ, who Appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates
it to himself to be the only Law-Giver, <hi>Iames</hi>
4. 12. This Judge is Lord over all, both in the
Church and in the Conscience, which are all Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
to him.</p>
            <p>15. Supream and Infallible Judge upon Earth
we know none, at least the <hi>Pope</hi> and Council, and
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is none.</p>
            <p>16. The Holy Scriptures of the Old and New
Testament, are the Infallible Rule, and Ground, and
Touch-stone of Faith, from which all Controversies
of Faith are to be Decided and Judged.</p>
            <p>17. In a Word, Tradition was not appointed by
Christ as a part of that Ground upon which we were
to build our Rule, by which we were to try particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Doctrines and Articles of Faith.</p>
            <p>18. The Scripture is the Object, the only Rule
and Standard of Faith, by which all Controversies
are to be Decided and judged: Tradition is the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicle
to convey this Rule to us and our Times; Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is the Instrument by which I Apprehend or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
this Rule: The Spirit of God is the Eye-salve
that Anoints mine Eye, and enables it to see this Rule.
The Church is the Interpreter (though not Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble)
the Witness, the Guardian of this Rule, and the
Applyer of the general Rules of Scripture to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Cases, and times, and Circumstances.</p>
            <p>19. To me this is a Rule; That to which God
Promiseth or Annexeth Salvation, is surely sufficient
for Salvation.</p>
            <p>20. I care not one Straw for all the <hi>Roman</hi> Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-Claps
of Damnation, where I have one promise
from God for my Salvation.</p>
            <p>21. In a Word, The Fundamentals or Substantials
of Religion do Apparently lye in Two Things, the
Law and the Gospel.</p>
            <p>22. The Scripture tells me that Love is the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
of the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 10.</p>
            <p>23. It tells me also, That Faith in Christ is the
fulfilling of the Gospel, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 1. and 20. 31.</p>
            <p>24. The Scripture sufficiently Informs us of Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals.</p>
            <p>25. But the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> you must Note, hath
another Rare Notion of Fundamentals; the like is
not to be found in Scripture or any Antient Author.</p>
            <p>26. That is a Fundamental Truth which the
Church Decrees, though never so Inconsiderable.</p>
            <p>27. But we must have most Sollid Proofs, That
the <hi>Pope</hi> or Council have such Dominion over our
Faith; That Fundamentals are all at their mercy.</p>
            <p>28. And there is nothing which more Essentially
overthrows the <hi>Popish</hi> Conceit of Fundamentals,
than the Consideration of the Pillar upon which they
Build it, which is the Churches Infallible Authority.</p>
            <p>29. The Infallibility of Councils being but a Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical
Imagination, I must needs Conclude, That
the foundation being fallen, the Superstructure needs
no Strength of Argument to pull it Down.</p>
            <p>30. Concerning the Coppies and Translations of
Scripture, they are a sure and certain Rule, because
they do sufficiently Evidence themselves to be the
Word of God, and the same for Substance with the
Original.</p>
            <p>31. The Divinity of Scripture in these, as well as
the Originals, for the Majesty of <hi>Style,</hi> the Sublimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of their Doctrines, the Purity of the Matter, and
the Excellency of the Design.</p>
            <p>32. To these God hath given Signal Testimonies
by the Conversion of Thousands, by Frequent and
Illustrious Miracles, by the Co-operation of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
with them in the Hearts of his People.</p>
            <p>33. Value precious time while time doth last, and
not when it is utterly lost.</p>
            <p>34. Woe to those Souls! whose Eyes nothing but
Death, and Judgement will open.</p>
            <p>35. If the Reward of Religion would be presently
in hand, who would not be Religious?</p>
            <p>36. God will have no Peace with that Soul that is
at Peace with Sin.</p>
            <p>37. Let Mens Opinions be what they will, <hi>VVith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Holiness no man shall see God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>38. The way of Carnal Liberty, is not the way
that leads to Eternity.</p>
            <p>39. Every Morning remember that thy Walking
with God, is the Business of that Day.</p>
            <p>40. Consider a Dram of Grace, is better then a
Talent of Wealth.</p>
            <p>41. He that hath but little in the World, must keep
the shorter Table.</p>
            <p>42. None ever lost by Jesus Christ, though they
lose for him, they shall never lose by him.</p>
            <p>43. Rejoyce you whose Riches are reproaches for
Christ, his Cross your Crown, the Shame of him
your Glory.</p>
            <p>44. You must Enter in at the Door of Heaven, by
the Key of Saving Knowledge.</p>
            <p>45. Lay up continually in Heaven, further your
Account, add to the heap of Increasing abundantly.</p>
            <p>46. Whatever thou doest for God, God keeps a
true Account, believe it, and Plow and Sow in hope.</p>
            <p>47. A good Soul is like the Compass in the Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
restless till it be turned towards the Pole.</p>
            <p>48. My Soul! thou hast made thine Everlasting
Choice, though the World answer not thy Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the Lord is thy Portion, and Heaven thine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance,
is it not enough?</p>
            <p>49. Hold on yet a little while in Faith and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and Self-denyal, and you are sure of the Crown.</p>
            <p>50. If to be Religious will make you Vile, resolve
that you will yet be more Vile.</p>
            <p>51. He that can use aright the Prospective of
Faith, to see approaching Judgement, will easily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
the Worlds Vanity, and imbrace the Crown of
Everlasting Glory.</p>
            <p>52. Have you made Heaven sure? if that be done,
you are prepared for the worst that can come.</p>
            <p>53. Have you past the Straits of the New Birth, do
you bear upon you the Marks of the Lord Jesus?</p>
            <p>54. Can you prove from the Book of God, that
you are past a meer Perswasion?</p>
            <p>55. Is not this your rest? Where is your Treasure,
and your Heart?</p>
            <p>56. Do you long for the Purchase of your Saviour,
the Fruit of your Prayers, the Harvest of your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
and the End of your Faith?</p>
            <p>57. Catch at Opportunity, away with Lazy Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
Cold and Heartless Professions, and a Lifeless
Religion.</p>
            <p>58. Consider, now is your time, what you do you
must do quickly.</p>
            <p>59. God's Patience waits, Christ knocks, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God strives, and Death waits.</p>
            <p>60. Take heed of a Mistake in the Two great Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
Graces.
