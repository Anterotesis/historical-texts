            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A Model of Government for the Publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king-Alms-houſes, lately Propoſed to be Erected in each County, <hi>&amp;c</hi>
            </head>
            <p>HAving ſome time ſince humbly offered to the grave and pious Conſideration of the Supream Authority aforeſaid, <hi>Propoſals</hi> for Promoting and ſpeedy Perfecting the Linnen-Manufacture; by which the good Ends before-mentioned may infallibly be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd, and more than Ten hundred thouſand pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> ſaved to the Nation; as is plainly demonſtrated by what I firſt printed, intituled <hi>Propoſals for building a Working Alms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe in every County,</hi> &amp;c. Sold by Mr. <hi>Harford</hi> at the Angel in <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill.</hi> As alſo by a ſingle Sheet, intituled, <hi>Proviſion for the Poor</hi>: Both to be had at Mrs. <hi>Waltons</hi> at the foot of the Parliament-ſtairs. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I give an account of a Spinning-Engine of my own Invention; by which a Childe of Four or Five years of age, may learn to ſpin, and earn Three pence a day, eaſier than a Childe of Seven or Eight years old now; and others Nine pence a day, eaſier than Six pence a day without it.</p>
            <p>But finding ſtill ſome very judicious perſons, after they have highly expreſt their Approbation of ſuch my Propoſals in the main, at the ſame time declaring, That they muſt oppoſe me, unleſs I could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſuch a method of Government in thoſe Work-houſes as the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be ſecured of theſe four things, <hi>viz.</hi> The Country from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cheated of their Money raiſed for Erecting and Furniſhing ſuch Houſes; the Poor from being abuſed; Knaves and unfit Perſons from being Officers and bearing Rule; and Juſtice from being wreſted, ſo as not to redreſs Grievances and puniſh Offenders.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, That the beſt Deſignes or Models may in ſome meaſure be abuſed; but it will not therefore follow, That with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive careleſſneſs we ſhould neglect what appears of certain uſe and profit, but rather to Regulate things ſo by the beſt of humane prudence, that they may as little as is imaginable be obnoxious to the inconveniencies of Fraud and Ill-adminiſtration. The particular method
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100959:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to do this, I left to the great wiſdom of the whole Nation, as beſt able to contrive the ſame; yet ſince it ſeems expected ſo far from me, that without it my Propoſals are oppoſed, I ſhall with all ſubmiſſion, to better judgments, humbly offer, A Model of Government of ſuch Working Alms-houſes, as far as concerns the preſervation of the Stock raiſed, and prevention of frauds and corruptions in Officers: which I conceive will remove all apprehenſions of any the Four before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Miſchiefs. That ſo all Judicious Perſons piouſly diſpoſed for this Good and Publick Buſineſs, may be ſatisfied before I move further for the proſecution of it. As thus:</p>
            <p>Since all Pariſhes are to contribute to this Work, and every Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoner is concern'd in the Charge, and may reap Benefit by it, if ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly managed; therefore becauſe it cannot be ſuppoſed, that any people will cheat or injure themſelves, let each perſon in every Pariſh be concern'd in or about the Government and inſpection thereof, as follows.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That it be Enacted,</hi> That all Contributing Pariſhioners, or the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of them, meet Quarterly in their own Pariſh, and Elect One or more as their Repreſentatives or Delegates for this Inſpection; and ſo every Pariſh to chuſe and ſend their Repreſentatives every Quarter of the year, to inſpect the ſtate of that Alms-houſe or Hoſpital to which they do belong. Each Pariſh neglecting to Chuſe, or Perſon choſen, neglecting (unleſſ in caſe of Sickneſſ) to give his attendance at the time appointed, to forfeit to the Treaſury of the ſaid Hoſpital. Each Repreſentive to be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 2 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> a day by his Pariſh for the time he is out on this Affair on Horſeback, and I <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> being out on Foot; provided that none continue out above ſix or ſeven days at one time. Or if this ſeem too burthenſome, two, three, or more ſmall Pariſhes may joyn to this Purpoſe as one.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That theſe Repreſentatives of each Pariſh, being aſſembled, may have full Power to Elect Governors, preſcribe Rules and Orders, chuſe Truſtees, appoint Offices and Officers: To ſee and inquire into the welfare of their reſpective Pariſhioners, who are ſent thither, and ſee they be not abuſed or diſcouraged: To hear and redreſſ all their Grievances, correct and reform all Diſorders: To call each Officer and Truſtee to an Account, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue them in their Office or turn them out, and Elect new ones, when and as often as they judge neceſſary. To which purpoſe they may ſub-divide themſelves into ſeveral Committees, and diſpatch much buſineſſ in little time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:100959:3"/>3. That all men in this Aſſembly may be of equal Authority, and no one perſon over-rule the reſt; and to that purpoſe that their Chairman con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue but for one day, and ſo dayly whilſt they ſit a new one to be choſen by themſelves: And who ſhall alſo, before they are admitted, oblige them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by Oath or ſolemn Promiſes, To do thoſe things that are juſt and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt: To ſuffer no wrongs or injuries to paſſ uncorrected: To do nothing for favour or prejudice: But to perform all that lies in his power for the ſafety and publick good of the Stock and Houſe; and to give a juſt and true Account to the Pariſh at his return, when they ſhall call for it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That no known Drunkard, Gameſter, Swearer, rude or diſorderly perſon, ſhall be permitted to have any Office in that Government; but that for the Encouragement of ſuch as are ſent to the Houſe to earn their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, all inferiour Offices or Places of preferment, may be conferr'd on ſuch of the Houſe as moſt deſerve, if capable.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That if it be known any perſon or perſons, directly or indirectly, hath given or taken any Bribe or Fee, or offered ſo to do, in order to obtain or confer any Office or Truſt, or do improve his Intereſt to promote or continue any Drunkard, Gameſter, or diſhoneſt ſcandalous perſon in Office; that then every ſuch perſon ſhall thenceforth for ever be incapable of having or holding any office in the ſaid Workhouſes, or giving any Vote concerning the ſame in any Aſſembly Parochial or Repreſentative.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That the Aſſembly of Repreſentatives have power to injoyn all Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Truſtees, either by oath or ſolemn Promiſe, That they ſhall act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ſuch Rules and Orders as ſhall be agreed on in the ſaid Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly: That they ſhall not conceal any wrongs or ill practices in any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in the Government, but diſcover the ſame to the next Aſſembly: That they ſhall every Quarter give a fair and juſt Account to that Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of all Moneys by them received or disburs'd, what Goods they buy or ſell, and the quantities and prices; and what Goods or Money they have in their cuſtody. And that any one Breach of ſuch their Oath or Promiſe herein, ſhall be puniſht as in the Caſe of Perjury; and beſides, the offender to make ſatisfaction for what he hath detained, imbezilled, or defrauded, to the Houſe or thoſe that intruſted him.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That for the building and firſt ſtocking, ſuch, Workhouſes, every Pariſh and Pariſhes, united as aforeſaid, ſhall (till the ſame are finiſht, and Government ſettled) ſend ſuch their Repreſentatives every fortnight or four weeks, who ſhall carry the proportion of Money payable thereunto by ſuch Pariſhes reſpectively. And that all Expenditors, Overſeers, and Truſtees
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100959:3"/>
imployed for carrying on the Work, ſhall be choſen by ſuch Repreſentatives, and be accountable to them every fortnight, till the Houſe be finiſht and ſettled as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>This method of Government or Inſpection I humbly offer as moſt ſafe, becauſe from Head to Foot the intereſt of one Member hath its, dependance on the other. Intereſt is a thing that governs all people in the World, both good and bad. A good man knows 'tis his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt intereſt to live honeſtly and uprightly in the fight of God and man; becauſe then he believes a bleſſing attends him. A bad man, though ſo fooliſh as not to regard his future happineſs, will yet act honeſtly too, when it is for his advantage ſo to do. Now according to the Conſtitution of the Government here preſcribed, every mans Intereſt is link'd together. As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. 'Tis the Intereſt of each Pariſh to elect honeſt Repreſentatives.</p>
            <p n="2">2. 'Tis the intereſt of theſe Repreſentatives to act righteous things, and elect honeſt Truſtees, not onely becauſe if they betray their Truſt for Favour, Bribes, or Prejudice, they are in danger of puniſhment and diſhonour; but alſo becauſe their own private intereſt lies at ſtake in the common intereſt of the Pariſhes.</p>
            <p n="3">3. 'Tis the intereſt of the Officers and truſtees, whether honeſt men or Knaves, to do honeſtly becauſe then they may continue in their Places of reaſonable profit; but if they do otherwiſe under ſo many Eyes, and ſuch frequent Inſpections, they cannot hope to conceal their Miſdemeanours, and then muſt be ſeverely corrected, and pay dearly for it.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the Form of Government relating to the election and qualification of Governours; I ſhall now adde a few words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the perſons to be governed, the rather for that I finde our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne abuſively repreſented, as if we intended theſe Houſes to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſlavery, and to keep people there all their lives; whereas I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe onely this:</p>
            <p n="1">I. That the Children of all poor people, who are chargeable to the Pariſh, be without abuſe employed in theſe Houſes at four or five years old and upwards; and all impotent people having one hand to work, and ſuch that can make uſe of their Legs, though no Hand, who cannot earn their living at home; and all others that are charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, unleſs it be married people having Children, not deſigning, to part Man and Wife, as ſome Oppoſers do ſuggeſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:100959:4"/>2. That the Men-children brought up in theſe Houſes, have their liberty to go to Trades or Service in Husbandry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when they come to the age of 13 or 14 years; and the Maiden-children to have like liberty, if they pleaſe, at the ſame age, to go to learn Houſewifry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That all Beggars, Vagrants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who have no Habitation, nor will earn their livings in any lawful Employment, be placed there.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That all dangerous perſons, Criminals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whom the Law condemns to be hang'd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (except in the Caſe of Murder and Treaſon) eſpecially ſuch as are guilty of Perjury and Forgery, may be confined to theſe Houſes, during life, or for a certain term of years; whereby they may have the opportunity to be reformed and made fit for another world before they die: and in the mean time to ſerve the Publick, being able by their labour to maintain as many more as themſelves.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That all Debtors in Priſon, not able to pay their Debts, or maintain themſelves (whereof there are many hundreds ready to ſtarve, having but three halfpence a day, and what they can beg, to live on) may remove themſelves to this Hoſpital; where they may live comfortably and be inſtruments for publick good. This I the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther preſs for, for that I have obſerv'd ſuch dogged Cruelties in ſome of our Priſons, where many poor famiſhing perſons have been crouded up in one little Room, without any thing to lie on, ſave Straw, and that ſo ſeldom changed, that 'twas become Muck, and onely fit to breed Vermine: And to aggravate their miſery, the Jaylor faſtned broad thin Plates of iron pent-houſe-wife acroſs the Grates of the Priſon, to prevent thoſe who were charitably diſpoſed, that they ſhould not give them Beer through the Grates, but that they might be forced to drink his, and pay two pence for little more than a pint. This unmerciful Cruelty have I ſeen in our Nation; And were it not better to have ſo many people comfortably at work, than languiſhing thus under unconſcionable Oppreſſors?</p>
            <p>Theſe are the perſons that may compoſe and fill up theſe Houſes. As for the Officers, the way of providing their Diet, Cloths, and other Circumſtances, I ſhall not here particularize: Chriſts Hoſpital, or the like Foundation, may afford a good precedent for us to imitate: Onely as a thing moſt neceſſary for the Chriſtian E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation and happy Reformation of this great Family, ſpecial Care muſt be taken that a godly Miniſter of a good kind diſpoſition and exemplary Converſation, be placed and maintained in each Hoſpital; and that the Children be allow'd one hour in each day to learn to read Engliſh.</p>
            <p>If any doubt whether the Inhabitants of the reſpective Houſes will be able to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100959:4"/>
maintain themſelves, my Anſwer is, That a man who hath his health and ſtrength, may by reaſonable labour, earn 18 <hi>d.</hi> a day; a woman 9 <hi>d.</hi> or 10 <hi>d.</hi> a day. Men or women, who are impotent, and can do nothing but ſit ſtill and employ their hands, may earn with eaſe 8, 9, or 10 <hi>d. per</hi> day: Yea, any one that could earn 6 <hi>d.</hi> a day heretofore, ſhall in this Houſe as eaſily earn 9 <hi>d.</hi> or 10 <hi>d.</hi> a day. A Child of a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate underſtanding at four or five years old, which coſt the Pariſh 1 <hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d.</hi> or 2 <hi>s. per</hi> week keeping, may after two months teaching, earn 3 <hi>d. per</hi> day the firſt year, the ſecond year. 5 <hi>d.</hi> a day, the third year 7 <hi>d.</hi> a day, and the fourth year 9 <hi>d.</hi> a day: ſo that at nine years of age, they may earn more than any woman by the ſame Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment can do without the help of our Engine: So that all may live comfortably on ſo <hi>eaſie an Employment as cannot poſſibly do them hurt.</hi> And by this means all the Nation will ſuddenly be bred up to ſuch an excellent profitable way of Induſtry, that no Nation in the world can exceed us; which without this Expedient, can never be effected with ſo much <hi>Expedition, Profit, and Eaſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>¶ Thus much I have propoſed, for the ſatisfaction (as I hope) of thoſe who are the moſt judicious Objectors, or at leaſt ſo far, as that with their Corrections, it may be made ſeazible and acceptable to the great Wiſdome of the Nation. In the mean time I leave my Propoſals, as a Ship without Governour, running a driſt amongſt the <hi>raging waves</hi> between the higheſt Rocks, and the ſhallow Sands, attended with Storms, Calms, and Croſſ-winds; yet laden with Treaſure ſufficient to enrich the whole Kingdom to that degree, that there may not be one Beggar in Nation. Nay, I will affirm, that 'tis more than 3000 <hi>l.</hi> a day loſt to the Nation, for every day in the year, whilſt it is neglected; beſides the loſs of what is of a far greater value, as may be more plainly demonſtrated, if deſired.</p>
            <p>Now would I crave leave to adde a word or two to another ſort of People, whom I cannot ſo properly call Objectors, as Oppoſers of my Propoſals, ſince they are ſo Cenſorious as to judge and condemn them before they have read them, or know what my Reaſons are; and ſo regardleſs of the happy Reformation intended there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that they think it too much to part with their unneceſſary ſelf-intereſt, and contribute a ſmall Aſſiſtance for improving the beſt and moſt profitable Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, crying out, <hi>The old way is beſt, and the work will be better done at home by their own fires</hi>; (when perhaps the wood is ſtoln out of their Neighbours hedge) <hi>And that the Parents may beſt bring up their own Children.</hi> Though too true it is, that inſtead of bringing them up in Induſtry to earn their Livings at five or ſix years old, and to be inſtructed in good manners both towards God and man, they now generally at four or five years old learn of their Parent to curſe, ſwear, lye, beg and ſteal, until they be fourteen or fifteen years of age; and ſo addicted to vice, that they are not fit for a good man to take into his houſe. And thus from Generation to Generation have they been, and are brought up to live and dye moſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably. To theſe Gentlemen I have this to offer, <hi>viz</hi> Suppoſe, Sirs, there were no Profits to be reap'd, That what we contribute is only a meer Act of Charity, accompliſhing the happy Reformation, comfortable Imployment and Maintenance of the Poor. Conſider, I ſay, if this were all, whether it be ſafe to keep that Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt or Money which we ought to part with, and improve for Gods glory and good of many of our poor Neighbours; ſince by ſo doing we may incur his diſpleaſure and our own ruine for ever. Or how can we that are impiouſly uncharitable, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect pardon and mercy, ſince it is ſo, that our Faith, our Hope, and all we can do, without Charity availeth nothing? What more plain and loud Call can there be for an Act of Charity, than when thou ſeeſt that by a free and general Contribution
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100959:5"/>
ſo profitoble a Reformation may be accompliſhed? I thank God, I think it not too much, or any diſhonour, to be on this account a Beggar for the Poor at the doors of thoſe in whoſe power it is to carry on this pious Work. I am certain, if they be for it, no good man dares be againſt it. What you may do I know not: for my own part, rather had I be a ſimple object of Charity like <hi>Lazarus</hi> a Beggar at die door of the Rich, than to be a rich man without Charity, to lift up my eyes in the flames of Hell. What will it profit a man to keep his Money in his pocket, when God ſhall certainly make him miſerable for not improving of it? Is it not an inſallible Truth, that no good man can poſſibly be uncharitable; and alſo that no bad man ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven? How neceſſary then is it for thee to be found in thy Stewardſhips improving thy Talent <hi>while thou mayſt</hi>? that ſo thou mayeſt be an object of mercy in that day when Almighty God ſhall accept of thy Account, and ſay, Well done, good and faithful ſervant, thou haſt been faithful in few things, thou ſhalt be Ruler over many Cities: Thou didſt not hide thy Talent in a Napkin: Thou haſt been a Father to the fatherleſs, an Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to the widow, in their diſtreſs and poverty: Thou haſt fed the hungry, clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed the naked, made ſuch comfortable Proviſion for their Children, and their Childrens Children, that none of them ſhall <hi>beg their bread, or want an Habitation</hi>; yea thou haſt contributed of thy ſubſtance to turn many Thouſands, who like the blind were <hi>wandring in the paths of Death,</hi> and haſt led them into the <hi>way of Eternal Life.</hi> Enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord.</p>
            <p>Much more might be added for the admonition of thoſe who had rather hide their Talents in the earth, than improve them for the moſt publique and greateſt Advantage; But I leave it as a work more ſuitable for the moſt Grave and Pious Divines, the Archbiſhops, Biſhops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whoſe expreſſions of zeal to the pious ends of this Deſigne, have invited me to believe they will not be wanting to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute their aſſiſtance, whereby to encourage thoſe who are under their Spiritual Care, to be aſſiſting in ſo profitable and charitable a work; by which the Glory of God, the Proſperity of the whole Nation, and the Welfare and happy Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of all poor diſtreſſed People, may be <hi>at once and together</hi> promoted.</p>
            <p>If any ſhall object and ſay, Such a deſigne would have been certainly embraced and proſecuted, had you propoſed it, in the Generation <hi>paſt</hi>; but is not ſo proper for, or probable to thrive in <hi>this.</hi> I deſire to know the obſtacle, at whoſe door the fault muſt lie: Sure I am, his Majeſty hath been moſt graciouſly pleaſed to give a Signal Inſtance of his Royal Approbation and Encouragement thereunto, though it ſeem to diminiſh his Majeſties particular advantage, more than all the Peoples in the Nation beſides. His Illuſtrious Highneſs Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> that emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Promoter of the Proſperity of our Kingdome, and ſeveral Noble Peers in particular have expreſt themſelves ſatisfied with the Utility of the Deſign: divers Reverend Prelates and Divines have declared their great and unanimous Zeal for promoting the work. And not a few worthy Gentlemen of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons are convinced, that no other expedient yet offer'd can ſo certainly, ſpeedily, and eaſily accompliſh the good ends deſigned. And why then may not this Age be as proper as the age paſt, for this hopeful Plant to flouriſh in, under ſo many cheriſhing Influences.</p>
            <p>Howbeit with all humble ſubmiſſion I refer the ſame, and all that I have ſaid, to the favourable Conſtruction and grave Conſideration of the great Wiſdome of the Nation; beſeeching God to direct their Councels, and bleſs their Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes, as may make moſt for his Glory, and the Nations Proſperity.</p>
