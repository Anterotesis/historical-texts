         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHereas <hi>T. Hicks,</hi> reputed an Eminent Brother of <hi>Wil.

Tho. Hicks</hi>'s said Dialogue is a meer Malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Forgery and Fiction, stuff'd with Manifest Slanders and Abuses, both against Persons and Principles; perverting them, and their words: In many things, Personating the <hi>Quakers</hi> with his own Ridiculous Falshoods &amp; Consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; together with scornful Canting Language, and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous Contradictions and Inconsistencies; which surely will add no Credit to the <hi>Baptists</hi> Cause, nor Convict o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: Whilst he pretends to act a <hi>Christian</hi> and a <hi>Quaker</hi> as opposit, he Antickly Abuses <hi>Christianity,</hi> and Scoffs at the Light and Life of Religion; who, when he Scurrilously acts a <hi>Quaker,</hi> he himself is that Nonsensical <hi>Quaker</hi>; who hath designedly forg'd his Dialogue to his own Fancy, so as not to puzzle himself with Problemes to be s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Insulting deal with all Objections and Questions of his own coyning: How deeply soever this man be Outwardly Plung'd, hee's yet Unchristened; and all the Water in <hi>Thames</hi> will not Wash his Defiled Conscience. But for these Dippers, and Particular Electioners, to Revile and Belye their Neighbours in Print (in this Time of Liberty) is no New or Strange Thing, whilst (upon their Partial Opinion of Election) they believe themselves secure from the Reward of Lyars, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8. by their Conceited Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal Election, Unchangeably Design'd from Eternity; in which they (viz. <hi>Baptists,</hi> and their Followers) must only be the Sharers, if all that Oppose their Dipping be Accurst; according to their old Brother, <hi>Hen.

Is not this to make the Light of Christ Oppose Christ?</p>
            <p>T. H. <hi>Surely this Light, instead of Directing what you do in a way of Subserviency to the Ends of this Covenant, doth directly Oppose it, is in that so far from being a Sufficient Rule, that it ought to be Rejected,</hi> pag. 38.</p>
            <p>T. H. Contrad. <hi>Yet all this is no Disparagement to the Light Within, to say, That God doth make any thing more known of his Will, then is, or can be known by this meer Light Within: for it is but to say, that Each Degree of Light is Serviceable to its End,</hi> p. 36.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anim.</hi> By this then the Difference is only about the Degrees of the Light, and not about the Nature and Property of it; and then, if each Degree be Serviceable to its End (as no Doubt it is) what Blasphemous Contradiction is it to say, That any Degree of this Light of Christ (as the Eternal Word) either doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly Oppose this Covenant, which is Christ, or is to be Reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted?

               <hi>Anim.</hi> See here again the Contradiction that's between these two Brothers: Can that be a Wile of Satan which thus Checks for Evil and Excites to Good? Oh! that these men would Obey it, that they might be better composed in their Minds, and not remain in this <hi>Bedlam</hi> frame of spirit; for, as yet, one acts the <hi>Bedlam</hi> the one while, and the other another while.</p>
            <p>T. H. <hi>This Light Within directs not our Actions to those Holy and Spiritual Ends, which the Scripture doth: Alas! whereto doth the Best of Men's Actions naturally tend, but to Swell them with Pride and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of themselves</hi>? p. 37.</p>
            <p>T. H.

            <p>T.

As it is his Iniquity to Reflect upon a People in general from the Failings of some, so he sheweth himself a Silly Logition to Reflect upon Principles by Personal Weaknesses; though this is his kind of Logick, whilst he sleights Revelation, and for an Instance against it, tells us of a <hi>Revelation that came from</hi> Paul Hobson, <hi>who, on purpose to try them, spake through a Trunk yet could they not distinguish his Voice from the Immediate Voice of God,</hi> p. 27.</p>

and Travels, but receive and eternally possess this Advantage, even a being ever with the Lord in his Everlasting Kingdom of Glory and Triumph.</p>
            <p>So we are still of the Apostles mind, expecting an Eternal Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage after Desolution; For we know, that if our Earthly House of this Tabernable were disolved, we have a Building of God, a House not made with Hands, Eternal, in the Heavens; for, in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our House, which is from Heaven, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1, 2.

            <p>Now whereas <hi>T. Hicks</hi> assumes the Confidence to Justifie his Work against us, call'd <hi>Quakers,</hi> as being <hi>Conscious to himself, that he has not in any thing Mis-represented us,</hi> p. 78. <hi>and that if the</hi> Quakers <hi>return him that Answer, that they are Lyes and Slanders, and that he is an Envious and Railing Man, he shall not think himself concerned to give any Reply, because he is fully satisfied, &amp;c.</hi> p. 90.</p>
            <p>To this I must tell him, Whether he will be pleased to Reply or no, he hath shewn himself very guilty of both Lyes and Slanders; and hath as plainly acted the Part of an Envious and Railing man, as ever any Opposers (have done against us) wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It doth very Ill become these <hi>Baptists,</hi> thus to Slander and Defame our Sufferings, to render us Obnoxious to the Powers (though they'll be of little Credit herein) knowing their own Cowardliness, Creeping and Sculking into Corners and Obscure Places in Suffering-Times: the Fruitlesness of Coertion hath not been manifest by these mens Valour; though now when they have gotten up into their Pulpits and Pews, they are not content with their own Liberties, but Envy us in ours; who have been Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to stand in the Gap, in deep Sufferings, with Resigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Estates and Lives, and yet must be Branded by <hi>T. Hicks,</hi> as Sufferers to satisfie Lusts, and to promote Carnal Interests: This his Malice and Slander is so apparent and gross, that I need not Paraphraise much upon it; but leave it to God, and his Witness in all to judge of.</p>

            <p>I would desire so much Reasonableness of <hi>Will. Kiffin, Tho. Hicks, Hen. Grigg,</hi> and the rest of their Fraternity; That when any of them are minded to write against the <hi>Quakers,</hi> about the Light of Christ Within, &amp;c. that they would seriously peruse and exam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ne their Work, and endeavour better to compose their Matter, without Contradictions; that if they come ingeniously to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the good Use and End of it, and what shall be the End of all that improve it, whether they have the Scriptures or not; it may prevent much further Controversie: But if they are still minded
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:58899:10"/>
to invalidate and deprave the Light that's in all men: let's have their Work consistent to deal withal; otherwayes, by their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traditions they shew themselves uncertain and dubious, as <hi>T Hicks</hi> and <hi>H.G.</hi> do; one while affirming, that <hi>the Light within every man is a Creature, and Mis-guiding</hi>; another while, <hi>Christ is the Life and Light of men:</hi> One while, the <hi>Light within is so uncertain, that there can be no certainty of Truth or Error, Sin or Duty by it</hi>; another while, <hi>It Checks for Evils, and Excites to Good:</hi> One while, <hi>It Opposeth the End of the Covenant of Grace, and is to be Rejected</hi>; another while, <hi>It ought to be improved and attended upon, every Degree of the Light being serviceable to its End, and we being accountable to God for every Dispensation thereof:</hi> One while they count it, <hi>A Cheat of Antichrist, and Wile of Satan</hi>; another while, <hi>It is the Light of Jesus Christ, as the Eternal Word, Enlightening every man that cometh into the World.</hi> Thus you <hi>Baptists</hi> are in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent Confusion; and whilst you come forth thus Contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to your selves, you are not worthy to be regarded, otherwise then men in <hi>Babylon,</hi> confounded (which may be lookt upon as a Just Judgment upon you, for your Perversness and Malice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Truth, and its Children) you being Opposing, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing and Warring against your selves, while you think to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute and render others Odious.</p>
            <p>I do at present pass by divers of <hi>Tho. Hicks</hi>'s Personal Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Abuses, as to my own Particular (having a fuller Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve against him, and others more eminent among them and their Work, for a further Occasion) being more concerned for Truth and Righteousness, then any Personal or Private Interest whatsoever; knowing also, that <hi>Tho. Hicks</hi>'s Morosity, Passion and Cholerick Humor (wherein his Tongue is at Liberty) ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders him no Potent Antagonist; being therein apt to break out in such Reviling Language, and Tinker's Rhetorick, against his Opposers, as, You'r a Knave; You are an Impudent Fellow; You are an Audacious Fellow; A Deceitful Fellow; You'r a Cock's-Comb, and thus to divers of us; which some of his Brethren have excused as his <hi>zeal &amp; manner of speaking</hi>; though this Hypocritical Covering (as also his pretended <hi>Christianity)</hi> is too narrow to hide a manifest Woolf, however sometimes Disguized,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:58899:10"/>
as in Sheep's Habbit. I would have <hi>T. H.</hi> to consider, That his Belief of being an Elect Person, will not secure him from the End of Railers and Revilers, who shall not inherit God's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10.
