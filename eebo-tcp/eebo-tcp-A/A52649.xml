         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

NARRATIVE
Of the Proceſs againſt
Madam BRINVILLIERS.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Proſecution of Madam <hi>d'Aubray</hi>
againſt Madam <hi>Brinvilliers,</hi> was the laſt
duty which ſhe could tender to the
memory of Monſieur the Lieutenant
Civil, her deceaſed Husband. After
ſhe had bewailed his death, ſhe ought
to revenge it; and the grief to ſee her
ſelf robbed of a Husband ſo dear to
her, and in ſo ſad a manner, begot in her thoſe juſt reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhe
hath ſhown againſt the Authors of her unhappineſs.
Could it ever have been believed that the Poiſon of which he
died ſhould have been given him by Madam <hi>Brinvilliers,</hi> his
own Siſter, for whom he had always a great tenderneſs?
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56009:3"/>
Could one have miſtruſted the hand of one ſo well beloved by
him? And could one with too much Zeal proſecute the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
of a Crime ſo hainous, committed under the ſhelter
of a friendſhip endeared by Nature and Affection? The noiſe
which ſo notorious an Action hath made in the World, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
that the Publick ſhould be inſtructed of the truth of
things, that every one may applaud the juſt Proſecution of
Madam <hi>d' Aubray,</hi> and ſee the effect of it, without having
compaſſion on her who wanted it for a Perſon, who ought to
have been ſo dear to her.</p>
            <p>Madam <hi>de Brinvilliers</hi> was of Quality, being the Daughter
to the Sieur <hi>d' Aubray</hi> Lieutenant Civil; an Imployment
worth 50000 <hi>livres</hi> yearly: She was Educated with great
care: She had both of Wit and Eſtate more than was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to make her happy: In her Family ſhe had no other
example but of a perfect Honour, and irreproachable Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue:
To conclude, all things ſeemed to promiſe in her a Life
quiet, honourable and regular, anſwerable to the merit of
her Anceſtors and her Relations. She was married about the
year 1651. to the Marquis <hi>de Brinvilliers:</hi> But Love and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
does ſtrangely corrupt the Mind, what tincture ſoever
it may have of Honour and Vertue, with violent Paſſions,
which ſeconded with opportunity and other means, become
at laſt ſolely predominant; firſt one accuſtoms himſelf to
imagine things, then to wiſh them, and finally to execute
them, the Impreſſion of a ſevere Education is effaced by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
and one falls inſenſibly into the diſorder occaſioned by
thoſe paſſions, and ſo becomes capable to commit the greateſt
Crimes.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Croix,</hi> the miſerable St. <hi>Croix,</hi> the moſt wicked Wretch
of all mankind, was known to the Sieur <hi>Brinvilliers;</hi> he had
ſeen him at the Army; and this wicked Man, who was of
mean Birth, without any Eſtate or Fortune, did induſtriouſly
ſeek his friendſhip, to profit of the exceſſive Expences which
the Sieur <hi>Brinvilliers</hi> made. The Familiarity he had with the
Husband, was ſoon converted to the Lady: He had a great
deal of Wit, and knew the ſecret of engaging her; and after
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56009:3"/>
having, according to the Rules, performed all the part of Men
paſſionately in Love, he became ſo abſolutely after of the
Heart of the Lady, that he compleated her ruine, together
with that of her Eſtate to which her Husband had very
much contributed, and made her Mind ſuſceptible of all the
wicked Impreſſions he gave her.</p>
            <p>The Familiarity of Madam <hi>de Brinvilliers</hi> with St. <hi>Croix,</hi>
ſoon made a noiſe in the Family: Monſieur the Lieutenant
Civil her Father uſed his utmoſt endeavour to break it; and
not being able to ſucceed by ordinary means, was
forced to have recourſe to the King's Authority, whoſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
he obtained to Arreſt the Gallant, which he did as he was
in the Coach of Madam <hi>Brinvilliers,</hi> conveying him to the
<hi>Baſtille,</hi> where he remained a Priſoner a whole year. What
rage did not this create in theſe two Lovers, whoſe Pleaſures
were thus diſturbed, in a manner ſo outrageous? The deſire
of revenge does eaſily ſeize a Spirit full of deſpair; but what
could Madam <hi>Brinvilliers</hi> do without an aſſiſtance as wicked as
was that of which ſhe was deprived? Could ſhe in any other
find thoſe Counſels and Helps for the executing the Revenge
ſhe meditated againſt her own Father?</p>
            <p>In the mean time St. <hi>Croix</hi> was in the <hi>Baſtille,</hi> where he
learnt very ſtrange Leſſons of an <hi>Italian,</hi> who was a Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
with him, and was a great Artiſt in making of Poiſons:
He finding a man enraged with the affront he pretended to
have received, and believing him capable of the greateſt
Crimes, imparted to him his moſt deteſtable Secrets. In
ſhort time St. <hi>Croix</hi> became very expert in them; and after
his liberty, came and preſented himſelf to Madam <hi>Brinvilliers,</hi>
in a capacity to offer her a ſure way to be revenged. Their
correſpondence grew more intimate than it had been before,
and was increaſed by the oppoſition it had from others: And
now their principal thoughts were how to prevent the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiets
that might be given them, and to revenge thoſe they
had already ſuffered: Wherefore the Relations muſt be put
out of the way, who were always troubleſom in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular;
and Poiſon was the Infallible Means which Madam
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56009:4"/>
               <hi>Brinvilliers</hi> and <hi>St. Croix</hi> compoſed at one <hi>Glaſer</hi> an Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary;
on the other hand ſhe had an Eye to the Eſtate of her
Family, which would be a great help to re-eſtabliſh her
ruined Fortune. She then reſolves, and being animated with
theſe three motives of <hi>Love, Revenge,</hi> and <hi>Intereſt,</hi> ſhe receives
from <hi>St. Croix</hi> the Poiſon which ſhe gave her Father, who in
1666 going to <hi>Offernon,</hi> which belonged to him, to ſettle mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
with his Tenants; Madam <hi>Brinvilliers</hi> accompanied him;
and taking the advantage of the time, ſhe put her poiſon
into ſome Broth which ſhe gave him, which worked ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently,
that he was immediately taken with extraordinary Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitings;
and all other the effects of it; inſomuch that he was
forced to return to <hi>Paris,</hi> without finiſhing his affairs. He
lay in great torment till his death, which followed ſoon after.
Oh the miſerable Wretch, that could poiſon her Father with
her own hands.</p>
            <p>Meſſienrs her Brothers remained yet, and they inherited
the trouble and impatience their Father had had, at the diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
commerce of their Siſter with <hi>St. Croix;</hi> they uſed
their endeavours to break it, and drew upon themſelves the
ſame revenge. See the manner. <hi>St. Croix</hi> had had a Servant
named <hi>la Chauſſee,</hi> worthy of his affection and confidence; him
they got into the Family of Monſieur <hi>d' Aubray</hi> the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor.
Had the private Engagement this Fellow had with
<hi>St. Croix</hi> been known, without doubt he would have mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſted
him, and never have truſted him in his Family. But
this Secret was kept from him; and this Miſereant had all
the opportunity poſſible to poiſon the whole Family.</p>
            <p>One day as he waited at Table at the Houſe of Monſieur
<hi>Aubray,</hi> the Lieutenant Civil, where Monſieur <hi>d' Aubray</hi> the
Counſellor dined, he affected to ſtay in the room when all
the other Servants were gone out for the ſecond Courſe, and
having put ſome of his Poiſon into a Glaſs of Drink, he gave
it to the Lieutenant Civil; the Doſe was ſo ſtrong, that the
Lieutenant, at the firſt taſting it, roſe from Table in an
amazement, crying our, <hi>Brother, your Men would poiſon me.</hi>
Could one believe that ſo juſt a ſuſpition ſhould not have been
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56009:4"/>
further examined, and that they would have been ſatisfied
with the excuſe of the Servant, who ſaid, That the Glaſs had,
without doubt, been uſed to give a Purge to one of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
that was ſick, and that that had left a bitterneſs behind
it, which the Lieutenant perhaps taſted.</p>
            <p>At length <hi>la Chauſſee</hi> finiſhed what he had before begun:
For attending Monſieur <hi>d' Aubray</hi> the Counſellor to <hi>Villiquoy,</hi>
where was likewiſe Monſieur <hi>d' Aubray,</hi> the Lieutenant Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
in <hi>April</hi> 1670, he had opportunity to mingle his poiſon
in a Pie; of which ſeven perſons that did eat were very ill;
but Monſieur the Lieutenant Civil was extremely formented:
He returned from <hi>Villequoy</hi> the 12 of <hi>April,</hi> altogether changed
through what he had ſuffered; his pains continued, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
him to his death, which was in <hi>June</hi> following.</p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>d' Aubray</hi> the Counſellor held out longer; but
<hi>la Chauſſee.</hi> had all the opportunity imaginable to give him an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Doſe, being in his Family. He died ſoon after, with the
ſame ſymptoms, and with the ſame circumſtances as his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
After their death, they were both opened, and by the
report of the Sieur <hi>Bachat</hi> their Phyſician, it appeared,</p>
            <p>That for the three laſt days, which Monſieur the
Lieutenant Civil lived, he grew lean; very dry, loſt his
appetite, vomited often, and had a burning in his sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach:
And having been opened in the preſence of him,
of <hi>Duvaut</hi> and <hi>Dupre</hi> Chirurgeons, and <hi>Gavart</hi> an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary,
they found his ſtomach all black, the Liver gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>green'd
and burnt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which muſt have been occaſioned
by poiſon, or a humor which ſometimes is ſo corrupted, as
to have the ſame effects as poiſon. That Monſieur <hi>d' Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray</hi>
the Counſellor was ſick three moneths, his diſtemper
being violent, and like to that of his Brother, <hi>viz.</hi> a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Fever; no appetite, his body burnt, and parched
outwardly, great restleſneſs in body and mind, which are
almoſt undoubted ſigns of poiſon. Nevertheleſs it may
happen, that a <hi>Cacochymie</hi> may have the ſame effects.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:56009:5"/>
The death of ſo many in one Family, made a great noiſe
every where; and whether through what the Phyſicians
might have ſaid, or through the extraordinary ſymptoms of
a diſeaſe, ſo rare and unknown, and yet common to a whole
illuſtrious Family, the report went, that Meſſieurs <hi>d' Aubray</hi>
were poiſoned; <hi>La Chauſſee,</hi> the cruel Miniſter of the paſſions
of others, had ſo cunningly behaved himſelf, that never any
ſuſpition was had of him: He had even ſo far gained the
favour of his Maſter, that to recompenſe his ſervices, he left
him, as he was dying a Legacy of 100 Crowns. But behold
what diſcovered all theſe things, which otherwiſe muſt have
been wrapped up in an eternal ſilence, and buried in the
grave of Meſſieurs <hi>d' Aubray.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saint Croix</hi> being ſuffocated with the vapours of the poiſon
he prepared for others, died ſo ſuddenly, that all his Goods
were ſealed up by the Officers, whoſe care it is, before his
greateſt Confidents knew of his misfortune. <hi>La Chauſſee</hi>
imagining, that he might be able to draw ſome advantage
from this accident, came thither, and made his oppoſition in
theſe terms.</p>
            <p>Oppoſition of <hi>la Chauſſee,</hi> who ſaid, That it is ſeven
years ſince he ſerved the deceaſed: That he had within
two years given him to keep for him 100 Pistols; and
100 Crowns, which were in a Linnen Bag behind the
Window of his Cloſet: And that in the ſaid Cloſet are
ſeveral Papers which concern him; which ſaid Moneys
and Papers he demands.</p>
            <p>This Wretch, to whom nothing was due, by this Act
gave occaſion for the ſuſpition which was had of him; and
his contrivance, which engaged him in the affairs of
<hi>St. Croix,</hi> made him do and ſay things; which brought him to
that ſad death of being broken upon the Wheel.</p>
            <p>In the mean time Madam <hi>de Brinvilliers</hi> was in terrible pain
to know what was become of the little Cabinet, which was
in <hi>St. Croix's</hi> Cloſet, in which were all the poiſons. She went
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56009:5"/>
to find out the Commiſſary to get it into her hands at what
price ſoever; ſhe was not ſparing of her money; ſhe offered
and did all that was poſſible to have it, before it was opened.</p>
            <p>The Familiarity which ſhe had had with this wicked Wretch
was publick, every one was informed of it, and therefore no
body wondred that ſhe had made him her confident, to keep
that Cabinet for her; but her very eager and extraordinary
manner of demanding it gave occaſion for ſome ſuſpition;
which made the Officers the more difficult in the matter,
who proceeded with all exactneſs to take off the Seal, and to
make an Inventory of the ſaid Cabinet, as follows.</p>
            <p>In the Cloſet of <hi>St. Croix</hi> was found a little Cabinet about a
foot ſquare; the Key was found on a ſhelf in the Cloſet. At the
opening of the Cabinet was found half a ſheet of Paper, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
as follows.</p>
            <p>I humbly pray thoſe, into whoſe hands this Cabinet
may fall, to do me the favour to reſtore it with their own
hands to Madam the Marquis of <hi>Brinvilliers,</hi> dwelling in
the New Street of St. <hi>Paul;</hi> ſeeing that what is in it
concerns her, and belongs to her onely; and that there is
nothing which can be of any uſe or profit to any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
whatſoever. And in caſe ſhe be dead before me, to burn
it, and all that is in it, without opening or ſtirring any
thing: And to the end none may pretend cauſe of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
I ſwear by the God, whom I adore, and all that
is moſt Sacred, that nothing be impoſed, which is not true,
in caſe my juſt and reaſonable intentions, in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
are contravened. I charge both in this and in the
other World their Conſciences for the diſcharge of mine,
proteſting, that it is my laſt Will. Done at <hi>Paris</hi> this
25 of <hi>May,</hi> 1672. Signed, <hi>St. Croix.</hi> And below was
theſe words. There is one Pacquet directed to Mr. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nautier,</hi>
which muſt be rendred him. There was likewiſe
found a Pacquet, ſealed with eight ſeveral Seals, on
which was writ, <hi>Papers to be burnt in caſe of death,</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:56009:6"/>
not being of any conſequence to any perſon. I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
pray thoſe, into whoſe hands they may fall, to
burn them; and I charge their Conſeiences to do it,
without opening the Pacquet. <hi>In this Pacquet was
found two others, filled with</hi> Drogue de Sublime.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> Another Pacquet with ſix ſeveral Seals, on which
was the ſame Inſcription, in which was found halfe an
ounce of <hi>Sublime</hi> in pouder.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> Another Pacquet with ſix ſeveral Seals, on which
was the ſame Inſcription, and in it were three other Pac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets;
in one was found half an ounce of <hi>Sublime;</hi> two
ounces in the other, and a quarter of an ounce of <hi>Vitriol
Romain.</hi> In the third Pacquet, <hi>Vitriol</hi> prepared. In the
Cabinet was found a ſquare Viol of a pint, full of clear Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
which having been examined by Monſieur <hi>Moreau,</hi>
Phyſician, he ſaid, He could not tell the quality of it, till he
bad made an Experiment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> Another Viol of a quarter of a pint of clear Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
with a whitiſh Settlement at the bottom; of which
<hi>Moreau</hi> ſays the ſame as of the former.</p>
            <p>A little Earthen Pot, in which was three quarters of
an ounce of <hi>Opium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> A Paper folded up, in which were two drams of
<hi>Sublimè</hi> in powder.</p>
            <p>A little Box, in which was a kind of Stone, called the
<hi>Infernal Stone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another Paper, in which was an ounce of <hi>Opium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Apiece of <hi>Anthimoine,</hi> weighing three ounces.</p>
            <p>A paper with Powder, under a cover, on which was
written, <hi>To ſtop the loſs of bloud in Women. Moreau</hi>
ſaid, That it was made of the Flowers of Quince, and of
the Core of dried Quince.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> Was found a Pacquet, ſealed with ſix Seals, on
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56009:6"/>
which was written, <hi>Papers to be burnt in caſe of death,</hi>
&amp;c. as above; in which were found thirty four Letters,
which, its ſaid, were written by Madam <hi>Brinvilliers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> Another Pacquet ſealed with ſix Seals, which had
the ſame Superſcription as above, in which was found twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ſeven ſeveral pieces of paper, on each whereof was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
ſeveral curious Secrets.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> Another Pacquet with ſix Seals, on which was
the ſame Superſcription as above, in which was found 75
Livers, directed to divers particular perſons.</p>
            <p>Thus you have ſeen the Inventory of this dreadful Cabinet.
Will it not be ſaid, that <hi>St. Croix</hi> was very Religious, and that
he was very well with Heaven, ſeeing under the reverence of
all that was Sacred, he pretended to rob the World of the
knowledge of the Legacy he left to Madam <hi>de Brinvilliers</hi>
A<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> execrable Man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> muſt he eſcape Humane Juſtice! and
could not <hi>Paris</hi> have the pleaſure, to ſee this publick Enemy

to revenge as many deaths, of which perhaps he was guilty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Who does not ſee the great Intereſt which Madam <hi>de
Brinvilliers</hi> had, to get his Cabinet into her own hands? ſhe
omitted nothing to effect it; and when ſhe ſaw her endeavors
were vain, ſhe reſolved to withdraw her ſelf. She departed in
the night from her Lodging, and appeared no more, But as a
perſon who endeavoured by her flight to avoid the juſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
of the Crimes of which ſhe was guilty.</p>
            <p>Finally, by the counſel of her own Relations, ſhe retired
out of the Kingdom to ſeek among Strangers the ſecurity,
which ſhe could not have in her own Countrey. She flies then,
while <hi>Lamane Procureur, qu Chaſtelet</hi> appears, in the Verbal
Proceſs concerning the taking of the Seal. The Act follows.</p>
            <p>Hath appeared <hi>Alexander de Lamane, Procureur</hi>
of the Dame <hi>de Brinvilliers,</hi> who ſays, That if in the ſaid
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56009:7"/>
Cabinet, as is alledged by the Widow of St. <hi>Croix,</hi> there
hath been found a promiſe, ſigned by her, of the ſum of
30000 Livers; it is a thing that was gotten of her by ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize,
which even in caſe her hand be proved, ſhe ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
ſhe is able to ſhow why it ſhould be declared <hi>Null.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Promiſe or Obligation was found in the Cabinet of
<hi>St. Croix;</hi> the Date is remarkable, for it was at the ſame time
that the Meſſieurs <hi>d' Aubray</hi> were poiſoned. In the mean
time, <hi>la Chauſſee</hi> affrighted with what he was told of the
ſtrange things that were found in <hi>St. Croix's</hi> Cloſet, ſhewed
ſo much of confuſion in his actions and diſcourſe, that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
the ſuſpicion men had before of his crimes. He was
Arreſted, Convicted, Condemned, and Executed. Madam <hi>de
Brinvilliers</hi> was involved in that proſecution, and from that
time was judged criminal: And on thoſe Proofs that then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
againſt her, and thoſe that were produced afterwards,
ſhe was Arreſted at <hi>Liege,</hi> where, after having wandred
through ſeveral Countreys, ſhe lived under a falſe name.</p>
            <p>The better to underſtand her caſe, it is neceſſary to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
what hath been ſaid by the Witneſſes, and what ſhe has
done, ſaid, or written her ſelf. Which we ſhall briefly do.</p>
            <p>The two firſt Witneſſes againſt her, are the two Confidents
of her Crimes, <hi>St. Croix</hi> and <hi>la Chauſſee.</hi> For what regards
<hi>St. Croix,</hi> we need onely read the Paper found in his Cabinet.
It is unneceſſary to add any reflections, which may render it
the ſtronger againſt Madam <hi>Brinvilliers,</hi> every one may ſee
with what execrations he aſſures, that the whole Cabinet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to her, &amp;c. Then conſider the great eagerneſs of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>de Brinvilliers</hi> to get this Cabinet into her hands, as,
among other Witneſſes, the Clerk of the Commiſſary <hi>Picard</hi>
declares, who depones:</p>
            <p>That Dame <hi>Brinvilliers</hi> came to his Maſter about ten
at night, asked to ſpeak with him: To which he anſwering,
His Maſter was in bed, ſhe bid him go up, and tell him,
That ſhe came to demand à Cabinet that belonged to her,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56009:7"/>
and would have it without opening. The Commiſſary ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſent down word that he ſlept, ſhe ſaid ſhe would
ſend her Servant for it the next Morning.</p>
            <p>Now ſee what <hi>la Chauſſee</hi> declared after having been put
upon the Wrack, touched without doubt with remorſe, which
ordinarily cloſes the laſt minutes of a wretched life,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>La Chauſſee</hi> being releaſed from the Wrack, Monſieur
the Rapporteur being withdrawn, about half an hour after
<hi>la Chauſſee</hi> prayed him to return: He told the Rapporteur,
That he was guilty; that St. <hi>Croix</hi> had told him, that
the Dame <hi>Brinvilliers</hi> had given him the poiſon, to poiſon
her Brothers; that he had poiſoned them in Water and
Broths; that he had put a Reddiſh-water into the Glaſs
of the Lieutenant Civil at <hi>Paris,</hi> and a clear Water into
the Pye at <hi>Villequoy;</hi> that St. <hi>Croix</hi> had promiſed him
100 Piſtols, and always to keep him; that he had given
St. <hi>Croix</hi> an account of the effect of the poiſon. That
St. <hi>Croix</hi> had given him often of thoſe Waters; that
St. <hi>Croix</hi> had told him that the Dame <hi>Brinvilliers</hi> knew
nothing of his poiſonings, but he believes ſhe knew of them,
becauſe ſhe always diſcourſed to him of his poiſons; that
ſhe would have obliged him to fly, and gave him two
Crowns to be gone; that ſhe asked him, Where was the
Cabinet, and what was in it; that if St. <hi>Croix</hi> could have
put any body near Madam <hi>d' Aubray,</hi> Wife to the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
Civil, he would perhaps have done it to poiſon her;
that he had a great mind to poiſon the ſaid Lady.</p>
            <p>This Declaration of a Dying Man, needs no Commentary.
The difficulty which ſeems in thoſe places which appear to
contradict each other concerning the Dame <hi>Brinvilliers,</hi> in
that St. <hi>Croix</hi> ſaid, he had received the poiſons he gave to her
Brothers from her, and yet that ſhe knew nothing of his poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings,
is very eaſie to be explained. It may be that of all
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56009:8"/>
the poiſonings of St. <hi>Croix,</hi> ſhe did only preciſely know of thoſe
of her Brothers: but for thoſe it is very plain ſhe did know
them; and that ſhe gave the poiſon, that is, that ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented,
adviſed, and ordered the poiſon. That Wretch St. <hi>Croix</hi>
hath perhaps deſtroyed ſo many perſons; and hath ſo often
given new poiſonous Waters to <hi>la Chauſſee,</hi> that he was aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to boaſt of all his Crimes, even to his greateſt Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents:
ſo taking this particular expreſſion out of the general
Declaration, it remains notorious that ſhe knew of his poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning
tho Lieutenant Civil, and the Counſellor her Brothers.
Let's now paſs to the other Witneſſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cluet Sergent</hi> ſays, That he ſaw <hi>la Chauſſee</hi> ſerve as
a Lacquey to the Counſellor <hi>d' Aubray,</hi> whom he had like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
ſeen in the ſervice of St. <hi>Croix;</hi> that he had told
Madam <hi>Brinvilliers,</hi> that if the Lieutenant Civil did
know that <hi>la Chauſſee</hi> had belonged to St. <hi>Croix,</hi> that he
would not take it well; that ſhe had anſwered him, Good
God, tell it not to my Brothers, they will give him the
Baſtonade, it is better that he get ſomething than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Wherefore the Deponent ſaid nothing to the Sieurs
<hi>d' Aubray,</hi> though he ſaw <hi>la Chauſſee</hi> go daily to St. <hi>Croix</hi>
and to Madam <hi>Brinvilliers,</hi> who courted St. <hi>Croix</hi> to
have her Cabinet, and would have him give her his Note
for 2 or 3000 Piſtols, or that otherwiſe ſhe would cauſe
him to be ſtopped. That ſhe had ſaid, That ſhe would not
have any body ſee what was in the Cabinet, that it was a
thing of great conſequence which concerned her. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent
adds, That after the opening the Cabinet, he telling
Madam <hi>Brinvilliers</hi> that the Commiſſary <hi>Picard</hi> had told
<hi>la Chauſſee</hi> that he had found ſtrange things there, ſhe
bluſhed, and changed the diſcourſe; that he asked her
whether ſhe was acceſſary, and that ſhe anſwered, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that <hi>la Chauſſee</hi> ought to be ſent into <hi>Picardy;</hi>
that it was long ſince ſhe had been at St. <hi>Croix</hi> Lodging
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56009:8"/>
to have the Cabinet, and that if ſhe had got it, ſhe would
have cauſed his throat to be cut. This Deponent adds
further, That ſaying to <hi>Briancourt,</hi> that <hi>la Chauſſee</hi>
was taken, and that he would tell all, he anſwered, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
a loſt Woman! That the <hi>Demoiſelle d' Aubray</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſaid that <hi>Briancourt</hi> was a Raſcal, he had anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
That ſhe knew not the Obligation ſhe had to him; that
ſome would have poiſoned her and the Lieutenant Civil,
and that he had prevented it. That he, the Deponent,
had heard <hi>Briancourt</hi> ſay that Madam <hi>Brinvilliers</hi> told
him, that there were ways to make away with people that
diſpleaſed her, and that ſhe always talked of poiſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edme Huet,</hi> Wife to <hi>Briſceir,</hi> ſays, that St. <hi>Croix</hi>
went every day to Madam <hi>Brinvilliers;</hi> that ſhe ſaw in
a Cabinet belonging to the ſaid Lady two little Boxes, in
which ſhe ſaw <hi>Sublimé</hi> in paſte and in powder, which ſhe
knew very well being the Daughter of an Apothecary. Adds,
That the ſaid Lady having one day Dined with company,
and being brisk, ſhewed her a ſmall Box, ſaying, There
was wherewithal to revenge her ſelf on her Enemies, and
that it was full of Succeſſions, and then put it into her
hands, and being returned from her Gaiety, ſaid to her,
Good God, what have I told you? do not tell it to any
body. That <hi>Lambert</hi> Clerk of the <hi>Palais</hi> had told her the
deponent, that he had carried the ſaid two Boxes to Madim
<hi>Brinvilliers</hi> from St. <hi>Croix;</hi> that <hi>la Chauſſee</hi> went often
to her Houſe; that not having been paid Ten Piſtols which
were owing him by the ſaid Dame, he went and made his
complaints to St. <hi>Croix,</hi> and threatned to tell the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Civil what he had ſeen, which was the reaſon that the
ſaid Ten Piſtols were paid him; that the ſaid Dame <hi>de
Brinvilliers</hi> and St. <hi>Croix</hi> carried always poiſon about
them, to make uſe of if they were taken.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:56009:9"/>
               <hi>Laurence Perrelle</hi> living with <hi>Glazel</hi> the Apothecary,
depoſes, That he hath often ſeen a Lady come to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
with St. <hi>Croix,</hi> that the Footman told him it was
Madam <hi>de Brinvilliers;</hi> that he would lay his Head it
was to compoſe poiſon; and that when they came, they left
their Coach at the Foire of St. <hi>Germain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Marie de Villeray,</hi> a Gentlewoman attending the Lady
<hi>Brinvilliers,</hi> depoſes, That ſince the death of <hi>Monſieur
d' Aubray</hi> the Counſellor, <hi>la Chauſſee</hi> came to find the
ſaid Lady, and ſpake to her in private; that <hi>Briancourt</hi>
told her that the Dame <hi>Brinvilliers</hi> was the death of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Perſons, who might be a help to her Children;
that he daily took <hi>Orvietan</hi> for fear of being poiſoned;
that he was afraid of being murthered, becauſe ſhe had
told him her ſecret concerning poiſoning; that <hi>Madamoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle
d' Aubray</hi> ought to be acquainted with the intention
ſome had to poiſon her; that there was likewiſe a deſign
againſt the Governour of the Children of the ſaid Lady.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Francois des Grais</hi> exempt, depoſes, That according
to the Kings Orders he ſeized at <hi>Liege</hi> the Dame <hi>de
Brinvilliers;</hi> that he found under her Bed a Cabinet, which
he ſealed up; that the ſaid Dame deſired of him a Paper
that was there, which was her confeſſion, and that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
her; that on the way to <hi>Paris</hi> the Dame <hi>de Brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villiers</hi>
told him, that ſhe believed it was <hi>Glazel</hi> which
made the poiſon for St. <hi>Croix;</hi> that St. <hi>Croix</hi> had given
her a meeting at the Croſs <hi>St. Honore,</hi> ſhewed her four
ſmall Bottles, and told her, See what <hi>Glazel</hi> has ſent me,
that ſhe asked him for one; that St. <hi>Croix</hi> told her, that
he would rather die than give it her.</p>
            <p>Adds, That at <hi>Maſtricht Theria</hi> would have corrupted
his Archers, and offered them 1000 Piſtols if they would
ſave her.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:56009:9"/>
               <hi>Theria</hi> being confronted, ſays, <hi>(he was obliged to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
againſt her, to ſave himſelf)</hi> That being parted from
<hi>Maſtricht, la Violette</hi> told him, That the Dame <hi>Brinvilliers</hi>
had a Pin, which ſhe would put into her mouth; upon
which he ſaid to her, That ſhe was very miſerable, and that
he very well ſaw, that what was ſaid of her was true,
that ſhe had poiſoned her whole Family. To which ſhe
anſwered, That if ſhe had, it was through wicked Counſel.
That one has not always good moments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Claude Rolla Archer</hi> depoſes, That ſeeing the Dame
<hi>de Brinvilliers</hi> would ſwallow a Pin, he ſaid to her,
What, will you make away with your own life? Are you
not contented to have poiſoned your Family? To which
ſhe anſwered, If ſhe had done it, it was through wicked
Counſel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anthony Barbier Archer</hi> depoſes, That he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
when the Dame <hi>de Brinvilliers</hi> was arreſted; that
being at Table, and drinking out of a Glaſs, ſhe would
have bitten a piece of it. That ſhe had told him, That if he
would ſave her, ſhe would make his fortune. That ſhe had
written ſeveral Letters to <hi>Theria.</hi> That during the whole
Journey, ſhe did all ſhe could to ſwallow Glaſs, Earth, and
Pins. That ſhe propoſed to him to cut the throat of <hi>de Grais,</hi>
to kill the <hi>Valet de Chambre</hi> of Monſieur the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary.
That he ſhould take and burn the Cabinet; that
to that end he ſhould bring a lighted Match to burn all.
That after being brought to <hi>Paris,</hi> ſhe had written to
Monſieur <hi>Penautier</hi> of the Conciergeric; that ſhe gave
him the Letter, and that he made her believe he carried it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Frances Rouſſel</hi> ſay, That ſhe has been in the ſervice
of the Dame <hi>de Brinvilliers.</hi> That ſhe gave her one day
ſome preſerves to eat on the point of a knife; that ſhe was
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56009:10"/>
ill preſently after. That ſhe gave her likewiſe a piece of
Gammon of Bacon, which ſhe eat, and ſince that time has
had great pains in her ſtomach, it being as if her heart
was pricked. That ſhe has been three years in this conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and believes ſhe is poiſoned.</p>
            <p>There were ſeveral other Witneſſes, who depoſed againſt
Madam <hi>de Brinvilliers;</hi> but ſhould we particularize them all,
they would fill many ſheets: Let it ſuffice, that nothing was
heard from them but of poiſon. <hi>Briancourt</hi> has not as yet ſpoke
but perhaps he will one day diſcover to the world the truth of
many things, of which he is the depoſitory.</p>
            <p>Let us now look into the conduct of the Dame <hi>de Brinvil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers,</hi>
in what ſhe has ſaid and writ: She is a clear Witneſs
againſt her ſelf; and without ſtirring from her, you may find
a conviction of all her crimes.</p>
            <p>A good and pious action may remain unknown to the
world, and the mind of Man made for virtue, gives it ſelf
thereunto without the knowledge of any one; while a wicked
perſon cannot diſguiſe his crimes, and that his Soul continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
allarm'd with the fear of being diſcovered, puts on his
countenance the true colour of his apprehenſions, and publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
to the world the crime he would hide. This Morality's
not her ſeaſonable; but it is certain, that we ſee few wicked
actions, which the carriage of the Authors do not ſooner or
later diſcover.</p>
            <p>Let us examine what were the ſentiments of the Dame
<hi>de Brinvilliers.</hi> We find ſhe had an extreme Love for <hi>St.
Croix,</hi> and a great deſire to reſtore her ruined Fortune; the
rage and deſpair to ſee her Love offended, and her Pleaſures
diſturbed, put into her thoughts many things againſt her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations;
and the hope of the advantage of ſo ample a ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
made her follow with her pleaſure the firſt dictates of her
revenge. She expects all from the cunning of her Gallant, to
whom ſhe ſhares her Eſtate. She relies much upon her own
quality, and on the great Relations ſhe ſtill had. Finally,

abandoning her ſelf to Love and Intereſt, ſhe gives the poiſon
to her Father, and cauſes the ſame to be done to her two
Brothers. Behold the crime, none ſee her conduct which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
it. And firſt let us examine the promiſe of 30000
Livers made to <hi>St. Croix,</hi> received by him, the date of which
agrees with the time of her poiſoning her Brothers; and who
will not judge, without making any farther reflection, but
that it was the price of their lives. She lived in greater fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity
with <hi>St. Croix</hi> than before; ſhe favourably receives
<hi>la Chauſſee;</hi> ſhe boaſts of the ſervices he had done her. Can
any one doubt, but that this was a deference ſhe had for her
Accomplices? But let us proceed, and obſerve her eagerneſs
to have that Cabinet, her deſpair that ſhe could not effect it.
Let us follow her to <hi>London,</hi> thence into <hi>Germany,</hi> and other
Foreign Countreys, where ſhe ſtill carried with her the fear
and apprehenſion of the puniſhment ſhe had merited.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſufficiently diſcover her guily. But now let us ſee
what ſhe anſwers for her ſelf in the Interrogatories that were
put to her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>She ſaid,</hi> That ſhe withdrew out of <hi>France,</hi> becauſe of the
affair ſhe had with her Siſter-in-law. That in her Cabinet were
ſeveral Papers of her Family, and amongſt others her General Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion;
that when ſhe writ it, her mind was wholly diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted;
that ſhe knew not what ſhe writ, her Spirit being wholly
diſcompoſed, to ſee her ſelf in a ſtrange Countrey, without aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of her Relations, reduced to borrow a Crown.</p>
            <p>Being interrogated on the firſt Article of her Confeſſion,
what Houſe it was ſhe ſet on fire? anſwered, <hi>Never to have
done it; that when ſhe writ it, her mind was diſtracted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Being interrogated on ſix other Articles of her Confeſſion,
anſwered,</hi> That ſhe knows not what it was, and that ſhe remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
nothing thereof.</p>
            <p>Being interrogated whether ſhe had not poiſoned her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and two Brothers, ſaid, <hi>She knew-nothing of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being asked, whether it was not <hi>la Chauſſee</hi> who poiſoned
her Brothers, ſaid, <hi>She knew nothing of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being asked whether ſhe knew not, that her Siſter could
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56009:11"/>
not live long, for that ſhe had been poiſoned; anſwers, <hi>That
ſhe foreſaw it, for that her Siſter was ſubject to the ſame infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that ſhe was. That ſhe had loſt her memory ſince the time ſhe
writ her Confeſſion.</hi> Confeſſed to have left <hi>France</hi> at the advice
of her Relations.</p>
            <p>Being asked wherefore that advice was given her, anſwers,
<hi>Becauſe of the affair of her Brothers. Confeſſes to have ſeen</hi> St.
Croix <hi>after he came out of the</hi> Baſtill.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Being asked whether</hi> St. Croix <hi>had not perſwaded her to
make away with her Father, ſays,</hi> She does not remember;
neither does ſhe remember whether <hi>St. Croix</hi> gave her any Powders
or Drugs; or whether <hi>St. Croix</hi> ſaid, That he knew the way to
make himſelf rich.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Being asked wherefore ſhe made a promiſe of 30000 Livers
to</hi> St. Croix, <hi>ſaid,</hi> That ſhe pretended to put this ſum into the
hands of <hi>St. Croix,</hi> to make uſe there of when ſhe ſhould have
need, believing him to be ſo much her friend, as not to let it be
known to her Creditors. That ſhe had an Indempnity from <hi>St.
Croix,</hi> which ſhe hath loſt in her Journeys. That her Husband
knew nothing of this promiſe.</p>
            <p>Being asked whether this promiſe was made before or after
the death of her Brothers, ſaid, <hi>She could not remember, and
that it was nothing to the purpoſe.</hi> And afterwards ſhe ſaid,
<hi>That</hi> St. Croix <hi>cauſed one of his Friends to lend her the ſame
ſum, and deſired her to make the ſaid promiſe to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Confeſſes to have been twice at <hi>Glazar</hi> about ſome indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Being asked about the Letters written to the Sieur</hi> Penau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier,
<hi>ſays,</hi> That if ſhe did write to him to cauſe <hi>Martin</hi> to eſcape, it
was to try the fidelity of <hi>Barbier Archer,</hi> in whom ſhe pretended
to have great confidence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Being asked what intereſt ſhe had to ask advice of</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nautier,
<hi>ſaid,</hi> That ſhe prayed him, that if he had any Friend, to
employ them in her affair.</p>
            <p>Being interrogated wherefore ſhe aſſured him, that ſhe
would do what ever he adviſed her; anſwered, <hi>Knows not
wherefore; but that the condition in which ſhe was, demanded
counſel of all the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:56009:11"/>
Being asked wherefore ſhe writ to <hi>Theria</hi> at <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> to
take away the Proceſs, ſaid, <hi>She knew nothing of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Being asked wherefore in her Letter to</hi> Theria, <hi>ſhe ſaid,</hi>
She was a loſt woman, if he did not get the Proceſs into his hands:
<hi>ſaid,</hi> She did not remember.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Said,</hi> That ſhe did not perceive her Father was ill, neither in
his going to, or return from <hi>Offemon,</hi> in 1666.</p>
            <p>The Cabinet of <hi>St. Croix</hi> having been ſhewed her, ſaid,
<hi>That it did not belong to her, that ſhe knew it not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Says,</hi> That ſhe had had no dealing with <hi>Penautier,</hi> but for
30000 Crowns, which he ought her.</p>
            <p>That her Husband and herſelf had lent <hi>Penautier</hi> 10000
Crowns, which he repaid; ſince had had no commerce with him.</p>
            <p>That it was with the advice of her Parents that ſhe reclaimed the
Cabinet found with <hi>St. Croix.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now we might inſert the Copy of the many Letters
found in <hi>St. Croix</hi>'s Cabinet, which declare the great confidence
they had in each other, and the engagement that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them: See one more remarkable than all the reſt.</p>
            <p>I have thought fit to put an end to my life, and for that
purpoſe I have taken this evening of that which you ſo kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
gave me; It is of the compoſure of <hi>Glazer.</hi> And by that
you ſhall ſee how willingly I ſacrifice my life to you. But I
do not promiſe you, that before I die, I ſhall not expect you
in ſome place to bid you the laſt Adieu.</p>
            <p>One may be cruel to others, but rarely is one ſo to his ſelf;
one often threatens himſelf, but ſeldom puniſhes; pardoning
himſelf for the moſt part, in hope to eſcape publick Juſtice.
And thus Madam <hi>de Brinvilliers</hi> outlived her own threatnings;
which lets us however ſee the uſe ſhe pretended frequently to
make of ſuch a Remedy, and the exceſs of fears which tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
her, and inſpired her with ſuch diſmal reſolutions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:56009:12"/>
The Letters which ſhe writ to <hi>Theria</hi> at the time that ſhe
was Arreſted at <hi>Liege,</hi> do ſufficiently manifeſt that ſhe then
lookt upon her ſelf as a loſt Woman.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the firſt Letter ſhe writes to him,</hi> That he ſhould come
in diligence and take her out of the hands of her Guard.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the ſecond ſhe wrote,</hi> That they were only eight perſons,
that five might rout them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And in the third,</hi> That if he could not come and relieve her
out of the hands of thoſe that carried her away, that he ſhould at
leaſt attache the Commiſſary, that he ſhould kill the Horſe of his
<hi>Valet de Chambre,</hi> and two of the four Horſes that drew his
Coach; that he ſhould take away the Cabinet and the Proceſs, and
that he ſhould throw them in the fire, otherwiſe ſhe was loſt.</p>
            <p>The Letters ſhe writ during her Impriſonment to the Sieur
<hi>Penautier,</hi> gave likewiſe great evidence againſt her; in which
ſhe ſufficiently declares her fears and apprehenſions, tells him
of the danger ſhe was in, gives him an account of her carriage,
and that ſhe diſguiſed things as much as ſhe could, &amp;c. Which
Letters were ſtill brought to Monſieur the Procureur-General
by <hi>Barbier</hi> the Archer, in whom ſhe had ſo much confidence
as to entruſt the dilivery of them</p>
            <p>Finally, none can doubt, but that Heaven, the great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venger
of wickedneſs, permitted that when ſhe was ſeized,
there was found in her Cabinet a faithful Relation of her Life:
Thoſe that ſpeak in her favour, call it a Confeſſion, and under
that name would bury in ſilence all it contains. The Dame
<hi>de Brinvilliers</hi> ſaid that ſhe writ it when ſhe was in a frenzy,
and her mind diſtracted, and that it ought to be rejected as
of no proof. It is a Memoire of ſeveral Sheets of Paper, where
appears nothing of diſorder or fury, but in theſe horrible
crimes that are there related. This being a frank Confeſſion
as well of thoſe crimes of which ſhe was accuſed, as of many
more, did contribute very much to the clearneſs of her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction;
of which there was before ſufficient proof.</p>
            <p>Thus far you have an account of the Crimes that were
charged upon the Dame <hi>de Brinvilliers,</hi> and of the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56009:12"/>
particulars of her Proceſs, which depended ſome
time, the Judges ſpending whole days in the Examination of
Witneſſes, the confronting them to the Lady accuſed, and
receiving her defence; who in the mean time was guarded
very ſtrictly to prevent her offering any violence to her ſelf
by poiſon or otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>But now ſhe enters upon the laſt Scene of her Life, and
comes to ſuffer the ſhame and puniſhment which her evil
Actions had merited: for the Judges after long and ſerious
Conſultation at laſt condemned her, and accordingly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
ſentence upon her. And becauſe ſhe had not
made any Confeſſion of the Crimes of which ſhe was accuſed,
it was ordered that ſhe ſhould be put to the Wrack, to extort
that from her by torment, which hitherto ſhe wanted inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity
to do of her own accord.</p>
            <p>The 17 of <hi>July</hi> was appointed for the execution. In the
morning early ſhe was called upon, to be put upon the Wrack;
which ſhe prevented by a frank and open Confeſſion of all
matters: She avowed the Crimes of which ſhe was convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted;
Gave an account of ſeveral things that before were
not ſo fully know. And as to her ſelf did not ſpare to
give the Hiſtory of her whole Life, and of all the Actions
of it: She lamented her acquaintance with <hi>St. Croix,</hi> the
cauſe of all her misfortunes; and for the reſt, behaved her
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>elf with a great deal of Reſolution and Chriſtian Diſpoſition.
And though ſhe was very weak, having ſuffered much by
ſickneſs; yet with a great deal of firmneſs and undaunted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
ſhe went to ſuffer what the Publick Juſtice of the Land
had inflicted on her.</p>
            <p>From the Priſon in the <hi>Concirgerie</hi> ſhe walked bare-footed,
and naked, only covered with a Linnen Robe, carrying a
large Wax-Taper in her hand, accompanied with the Officers
of Juſtice, and 500 Archers, (who are as it were the Sheriffs
Men) to the Church of <hi>Noſtre-Dame;</hi> where kneeling before
the great Gate of the Church, ſhe made her Conſeſſion; that
done, ſhe was put into a little Cart, and carried with the
ſame Guard to the <hi>Greve,</hi> the ordinary place where Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56009:13"/>
are executed, where a Scaffold was erected: being
come thither, ſhe entertained thoſe that were about her ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
hours with a Relation of all the remarkable paſſages of
her Life, which ſhe did, without any the leaſt ſign of fear or
apprehenſion of her approaching death; yet with a great
ſence of the wicked Actions ſhe had committed, for which
ſhe deſired the pardon of all good people. It would be too
long to particularize here all ſhe ſaid: It is enough to add,
That having almoſt wearied her ſelf with much ſpeaking, ſhe
concluded all with the uſual acts of Devotion, and undaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
ſubmitted her Neck to the Ax: Her Head being cut off,
it was together with her Body burnt, and the Aſhes thrown
into the Air.</p>
