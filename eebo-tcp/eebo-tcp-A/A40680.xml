            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <bibl>PSAL. 37. 37.</bibl>
               <q>Mark the Perfect, behold the

            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS and the 73. <hi>Psalm</hi> are of
the same subject, wherein
<hi>David</hi> endeavours to cure
an Epidemical disease, with
which the best Saints and
servants of God are often
distempered: Observe in this <hi>Disease,</hi> the
<hi>nature, danger, cause</hi> and <hi>cure</hi> thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:46896:6"/>
The <hi>Nature,</hi> namely fretting fits of the
soul, at the consideration of the constant
peace, plenty and prosperity of wicked men.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Danger</hi> thereof, It causeth the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
of the spirit, and is destructive to
the health of the soul. Yea, when this disease
comes to the <hi>Paroxism,</hi> the height and heat
thereof, it becometh dishonourable to God;
aspersing and be-libelling him, as if he wanted
Goodness, and would not; or Power, and
could not; or Justice, and doth not order
matters better then they are.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Cause</hi> thereof it proceedeth from a
double defect in men:
<list>
                  <item>1 Want of <hi>Faith</hi> to trust in God.</item>
                  <item>2 Want of <hi>Patience</hi> to wait on God.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>This is the reason why the practice of these
two graces is so often inculcated by <hi>David</hi> in
this Psalm.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Cure</hi> thereof: <hi>David</hi> applyes many
Cordials, (for less then Cordials will not do
the deed) seeing by his own confession, <hi>Ps.
73. 21. His heart was grieved</hi> with his fretting
fits. We will onely instance on the two
last.</p>
            <p>One is a serious consideration, <hi>ver.</hi> 35 of the
short pleasure and certain pain of the wicked.
It was a good prayer of a <hi>good man, Lord keep
me from a temporal heaven here, and an eternal
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:46896:6"/>
hell hereafter.</hi> True it is, <hi>Psalm</hi> 73. 4. that to
the wicked, <hi>there are no bands in their death:</hi>
and no wonder, when they have all bands af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
death.</p>
            <p>The second is a studious observation of the
<hi>perfect Mans</hi> condition, who though meeting
with many <hi>intermediate</hi> broils and brunts,
and bickerings in this life: yet all at last winds
up with him in a comfortable close, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
conclusion, <hi>Mark the Perfect, behold the
Vpright, for the end of that man is peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Observe in the words two general parts:
<list>
                  <item>1 The <hi>description of the Dead.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2 The <hi>direction to the Living.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>description of the Dead,</hi> we have two
particulars:
<list>
                  <item>1 What he was. A practicer of Perfection
and Uprightness.</item>
                  <item>2 What he is. A possessour of a peaceable
end.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>direction to the Living</hi> we have an
invitation, or rather an injunction to mark
and behold.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1 What was done by the man, when
living: his Holiness.</item>
               <item>2 What was done to the man, when dead:
his Happiness.</item>
            </list>
            <p>This our Sermon being now preached in
the juncture of the old and new Year: What
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:46896:7"/>
better subject to end the old, then to speak
of the description of the dead? What fitter
matter to begin the new, then to treat of the
direction to the living? <hi>Mark the Perfect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the Vpright: for the end of that man is
peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before we enter on the words, it will be a
charitable work to reconcile the seeming va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance
betwixt the two Translations: I mean
that which is commonly prefixed at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
and what is constantly inserted in
the middle of our Bibles.</p>
            <q>
               <bibl>The Old Translation.</bibl>
               <p>Keep innocency, and take heed unto the thing
that is right, for that shall bring a man peace
at the last.</p>
            </q>
            <q>
               <bibl>The New Translation.</bibl>
               <p>Mark the Perfect man, and behold the Vpright,
for the end of that man is peace.</p>
            </q>
            <p>See here a vast difference betwixt the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
rendring of the words: <hi>If the Trumpet,</hi>
1 Cor. 14. 8. <hi>give an uncertain sound, who shall
be prepared for the battel?</hi> But where shall the
unlearned, though honest hearted Reader
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:46896:7"/>
dispose of his belief and practice, when
there be such irreconcileable differences in
the <hi>Translation</hi> of Gods Word.</p>
            <p>I answer, the seeming difference ariseth
from the latitude of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> words, so
extensive in their signification: for <hi>Shemor</hi>
which in my text is translated, <hi>Mark,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the first and most frequent acception
thereof: signifieth also in a secondary sense,
to <hi>Keep, seeing those things which we mark, we
also keep, at the least for some short time in our
memorie.</hi> The same may be said, that the
word <hi>Behold,</hi> in my Text, is rendered in the
<hi>Old Translation, take heed,</hi> seeing the <hi>Hebrew</hi> wil
bear both: <hi>Tham</hi> and <hi>Iaschar,</hi> most commonly
and constantly denote the <hi>Concrete, Perfect, Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
Righteous,</hi> and <hi>Innocent:</hi> But sometimes
signifieth the abstract also, Perfection, Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightness,
Innocencie Let not therefore the
two Translations fall out, for they are <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi>
and both the <hi>sons</hi> of the same <hi>Parent,</hi>
the <hi>Original:</hi> Though give me leave to say
the youngest <hi>child</hi> is most like the <hi>father,</hi> and
the newest <hi>Translation</hi> herein, most naturally
expresseth the sense of the <hi>Hebrew.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let none cavil that such laxity in the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi>
words occasions uncertainty in the
meaning of the <hi>Scripture:</hi> For God on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
uses such words importing several sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:46896:8"/>
not to distract our heads, but dilate
our hearts, and to make us <hi>Rechoboh, Room</hi> for
our practice in the full extent thereof, <hi>Psal.</hi>
119. 92. <hi>Thy commandement is exceeding broad,</hi>
and is penned in words and phrases, accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of several senses, but all excellent for us
to practice: So that both Translations may
be happily compounded in our endeavours,
<hi>Mark the perfect, keep innocency, and behold the
upright, and take heed to the thing that is right;
for the end of that man is peace:</hi> and that shall
bring a man peace at the last.</p>
            <p>Begin we with the description of the dead,
<hi>Perfect,</hi> and what is a good Comment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<hi>Vpright.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> It is impossible this world should
afford a <hi>perfect man.</hi> What saith <hi>David,</hi> Psal.
14. 2. <hi>The Lord looked down from Heaven upon
the children of men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to see if there were any that
did understand and seek after God. They are all
gone aside, they are altogether become filthy, there
is none that doth good, no not one.</hi> But what
saith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccles. 2. 12. <hi>For what can the
man do, who commeth after the King, even that
which hath been done already.</hi> But what shall he
do that cometh after the <hi>King of Heaven?</hi> can
<hi>Subjects</hi> hope that their discoveries will be
clearer then their <hi>Soveraigns?</hi> shall man <hi>living</hi>
on <hi>earth</hi> see more then God <hi>looking</hi> from <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:46896:8"/>
he could not meet with <hi>one good,</hi> where
then shall we mark a <hi>perfect man?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ. David</hi> in the place alledged, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes
the general corruption <hi>ad prae varicatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem</hi>
of all mankind by nature; in the latitude
whereof we confess the perfect man in my
Text was involved. As all Metals when they
are first taken out of the earth, have much
dross and oar, but by art and industrie may
afterwards be refined: so the man in my text
was equally evil with all others by nature, till
defecated by grace, and by Gods goodness re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
to such a height of puritie as in some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
will endure the touch, and become <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a four fold respect may a servant of God
be pronounced Perfect in this life.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>Comparatively,</hi> in reference to wicked
men, who have not the least degree or desire
of goodness in them. Measure a servant of
God by such a dwarf, and he will seem a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
person, yea, comparatively perfect.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>Intentionally:</hi> The drift, scope, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of such a mans life, is to desire perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which his desires are seconded with all the
strength of his weak endeavours: He draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his bow with all his might, and Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is the mark he aimeth at, though too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
his hand shakes, his bow starts, and his
arrow misses.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:46896:9"/>
3 <hi>Inchoatively:</hi> We have here the <hi>begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
and the <hi>earnest</hi> as of the Spirit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 22.
So of all spiritual graces, expecting the full
(not <hi>payment,</hi> because a meer <hi>gift,</hi> but) <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt</hi>
of the rest hereafter. In this world we
are a <hi>perfecting,</hi> and in the next, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 23.
<hi>we shall come to the spirits of just men made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But blame me not, Beloved, if I be brief in
these three kinds of Perfections, rather touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then landing at them, in our discourse;
seeing I am partly affraid, partly ashamed to
lay too much stress and weight on such slight
and slender foundations. I hasten with all
convenient speed to the fourth, which one is
worth all the rest. A servant of God in this
life is perfect.</p>
            <p>4 <hi>Imputatively:</hi> Christs perfections through
Gods mercy being impu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed unto him. If I be
worsted in my <hi>front,</hi> and beaten in my <hi>main
Battel,</hi> I am sure I can safely <hi>retreat</hi> to this my
invincible <hi>Ree<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>:</hi> In the agonie of temptation
we must quit <hi>comparative perfection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Alass, Relation is rather a <hi>shadow</hi> then a <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance:</hi>
quit <hi>intentional perfection,</hi> being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious
to our selves how oft our actions cross
our intentions. Quit <hi>inchoative perfection;</hi> for
whilest a servant of God compareth the little
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:46896:9"/>
goodness he hath with that great proportion
which by Gods law he ought to have, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth
thereof as the pious Jews did of the
Foundation of the second Temple, <hi>Haggai</hi> 2.
3. <hi>Is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing?</hi>
But stick we may and must to <hi>impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
perfection,</hi> which indeed is Gods act,
cloathing us with the <hi>Righteousness of Iesus
Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the reason the Saints are unwilling
to own any other <hi>perfection:</hi> for though God
<hi>Iob</hi> 1. 1. is pleased to stile <hi>Iob</hi> a <hi>perfect man,</hi>
yet see what he saith of himself, <hi>Iob 9. 20. If I
say that I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.</hi>
God might say it, <hi>Iob</hi> durst not for fear of
pride and presumption. Indeed <hi>Noah</hi> is the first
person, who is pronounced <hi>perfect</hi> in <hi>Scripture,
Gen.</hi> 6. 9. But mark I pray what went in the
verse before: <hi>But Noah found grace in the eyes
of the Lord.</hi> Not that his <hi>finding grace</hi> is to be
confined to his particular preservation from
the Deluge, (which was but one branch or
sprig of Gods grace unto him.) But his whole
person was by Gods goodness accepted of,
<hi>Noahs</hi> perfection more consisting in that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
then his own amiableness, approved
not so much because God found goodness in
<hi>Noah,</hi> but because <hi>Noah</hi> found grace in
God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:46896:10"/>
Come we now in the description of the
Dead, to <hi>what he is, The end of that man is
peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Some will object that daily expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
confutes the truth of this Doctrine,
what more usual then to see Gods servants
tossed, tumbled, tortured, tormented, often
ending their painful lives with shameful
deaths. <hi>Cushi</hi> being demanded by <hi>David</hi> to
give an account of <hi>Absaloms</hi> condition, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi>
18. 32. made this mannerly and politique re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn:
<hi>The enemies of my Lord the King, and all
that rise up against thee to do thee hurt, be as that
young man is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But some will say, if this be a <hi>peaceable
end,</hi> to lead an afflicted life, and have an
ignominious death, may the enemies of God
and all goodness, the infringers of our Laws
and Liberties, the haters of Learning and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
the destroyers of Unity and order,
have their souls surfet of such a <hi>peaceable
end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Resp.</hi> In answer hereunto we must make
use of our Saviours distinction, the same for
substance and effect, though in words there
be variation thereof. Being taxed by <hi>Pilate</hi>
for treason against <hi>Caesar;</hi> he pleaded for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<hi>Ioh. 18. 36. My kingdom is not of this world:</hi>
So say we, to salve all objections, our <hi>peace,</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:46896:10"/>
that is the <hi>peace</hi> in our Text, (and God make
it <hi>ours,</hi> not only to treat and hear, but partake
thereof,) <hi>is not of this world,</hi> consisteth not in
temporal or corporal prosperity; but is of
a more high and heavenly nature. Indeed this
<hi>peace</hi> is <hi>in</hi> this world, but not <hi>of</hi> this world;
begun here in the calm of a clear and quiet
conscience, and finished hereafter in the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of endless happiness. When the <hi>man</hi> in
my Text, becomes perfectly <hi>perfect,</hi> he shall
then become <hi>perfectly peaceable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However we may see that sometimes (I
say not alwayes) God sets a signal character
of his favour on some of his servants, enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at their end a generall calm, and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
tranquillity towards all to whom they are
related. Amongst the many priviledges of
Saints reckoned up <hi>Iob</hi> 5. none more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
then that verse 23. <hi>For the Stones of the
field shall be at league with thee, and the beasts
of the field shall be at peace with thee.</hi> Have we
here a <hi>Dichotomy</hi> of all wicked men, or a
sorting of them all into two sides.</p>
            <p>Some are <hi>Stones,</hi> like <hi>Nabal 1 Sam.</hi> 25. 37.
stupid, sottish, senseless; no Rhetorick
with its expanded hand, no Logick with
its contracted fist, no Scripture, no reason,
no practice, no precedent can make any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
upon them, so that the best of men
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:46896:11"/>
may even despair to get their good will. Well
the way to do it, and procure a perfect peace
with them, is to please God.</p>
            <p>Others are <hi>beasts</hi> like the <hi>Cretians, Tit.</hi> 1.
12. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, so fierce, so furious, so craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
so cruel, no medling with them without
danger. As the former could not conceive,
so these will not abide any rational debate
with them. The former were too low and
silly, too much beneath: these high and
haughty, too much above perswasion to
peace; mention but the name thereof, and
they <hi>psal. 112. prepare themselves to bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The art then to make these friends with a
man, is only this, to endeavour to please the
high God of heaven; and then <hi>Solomons</hi>
words will come to pass, <hi>Prov. 16. 7. When a
mans wayes please the Lord, he maketh even his
enemies to be at peace with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It once came to pass in <hi>England</hi> (and but
<hi>once</hi> it came to pass in <hi>England)</hi> namely, when
<note n="*" place="margin">See his life lately printed.</note> Sir <hi>Thomas Moor</hi> was <hi>Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor,</hi>
that the <hi>Cryer</hi> in <hi>Chancery</hi>
being commanded to call the next
<hi>cause,</hi> returned this answer, <hi>there were no more
causes to be heard.</hi> Not that there was no
more on the <hi>file</hi> for that day (which is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
and usual) but, which is strange, that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:46896:11"/>
then there was no more <hi>sutes</hi> depending in
the whole Court of <hi>Chancery,</hi> but that all
ripened for Trial, were decided. Then was
<hi>Ianus</hi> his Temple shut clean throughout
<hi>England,</hi> in Cases betwixt <hi>Plaintiff</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant,</hi>
relating to equity and conscience.
Whether this proceeded from the peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness
of people in that age, not so quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
and litigious as in ours: or from the
goodness of the Judge, either, happy, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
to compound differences without any
sute; or dextrous, publickly to decide them
with all expedition.</p>
            <p>But when some good man hath lyen on
his <hi>death bed,</hi> though having many sutes in
his life, all then are ended and composed.
Call the <hi>sute</hi> betwixt this man and his <hi>God,</hi>
long since it is attoned, and both made friends
in <hi>Christ.</hi> Cal the <hi>sute</hi> betwixt this man and his
<hi>conscience,</hi> it is compremised, and both of them
fully agreed. Cal the <hi>sute</hi> betwixt this man and
his <hi>enemies, Stones,</hi> and <hi>Beasts,</hi> it is compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and they at peace with him. Call the
<hi>sute</hi> betwixt this man and all other Creatures,
it is taken up, and he and they fully reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.
Thus I say sometimes, not alwayes,
God graceth some of his servants that they
depart in an <hi>universal peace,</hi> a personal fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
indulged to some select Saints. But ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:46896:12"/>
and universally all the true servants of
God, whatever their outward condition be,
go from <hi>peace</hi> to <hi>peace;</hi> from the first fruits
of peace in their conscience, to the full fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thereof in heaven. <hi>Mark the perfect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the upright: for the end of that man is
peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Come we now to the <hi>direction of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving:
Mark the Perfect, behold the Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not said, Gaze on the <hi>Perfect,</hi> Stare on
the <hi>Vpright,</hi> this men of themselves are too
<hi>prone</hi> to do without any bidding: nay, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to Gods positive command, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 33.
<hi>Whilest ye were made a gazing stock by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
and afflictions.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> in the
person of Christ complains, <hi>Psal. 22. 17. they
look and stare upon me:</hi> partly with eyes of
wonder, as on so many Monsters and Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies,
1 <hi>Pet. 4. 4. Wherein they think it strange
that you run not with them to the same excess of
Riot:</hi> partly with the eyes of scorn, as on so
many miserable wretches. Indeed God and
wicked men agree in this point, <hi>that good men
are not worthy to live here.</hi> But upon different,
yea, contrary accounts, God esteems them
<hi>too good to live here, Heb. 11. 38. Of whom the
world was not worthy.</hi> Wicked men conceive
them <hi>too bad to live here, Act. 22. 22. Away
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:46896:12"/>
with such a fellow from off the earth, for it is not
fit that he should live.</hi> Which makes them to
<hi>behold the perfect and upright,</hi> with scorn and
contempt.</p>
            <p>However <hi>mark the Iust, behold the Vpright,</hi>
do it solemnly, do it seriously, not with a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sory
look, fix thy sight, and for some time;
let it dwell on so eminent an Object. <hi>Mark
the perfect,</hi> as a Schollar marks his copie to
write after it. Then will it come to pass with
thee as with <hi>Moses, Exod.</hi> 34. 29. He so long
had seen the back-parts or Suburbs of Gods
glory, that the <hi>skin of his face shone,</hi> guilded
with the reflexion thereof. So those who
<hi>mark the Perfect and behold the Vpright,</hi> not
only with a <hi>fore-cast,</hi> but chiefly with a <hi>reflex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
look,</hi> cannot but be gainers thereby. For
the godly, who, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 15.
<hi>shine as lights among a crooked and perverse Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the world,</hi> will make such as effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mark them, become like unto them, and
shine accordingly. We see that such who
look on <hi>Bleer-eyes,</hi> have their own sight in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
therewith; and those who diligently
<hi>mark,</hi> and stedfastly fasten the eyes of their
souls, on the <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>upright man,</hi> will in
process of time, partake of their <hi>perfection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. It serveth to confute such, who,
though living long in this world, and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:46896:13"/>
with varietie of persons, yet mark and
observe nothing at all. If a privy inspection
might be made into the Diaries and Journals
of such mens lives, how would they be found
filled with empty cyphers, whose total sum
amounts to just <hi>nothing.</hi> When Messengers
and Trumpeters come into the Castles and
Garrisons of their enemies, commonly they
are brought <hi>blindfolded,</hi> that they may
make no dangerous discoveries to report to
their Party at their return. What out of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie
is done to them, that many out of idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and ignorance do to themselves, mask
and hood-wink their souls, do take notice of
nothing in their passage through this world.</p>
            <p>Others mark but only such things which
are not remarkable. <hi>Dina</hi> marks, but what?
<hi>Gen. 34. 1. The fancie-ful fashions of the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Canaan:</hi> and we may generally observe,
that all observations follow the humour of
the Observers, so that what vice or vertue in
him is predominant, plainly appears in their
discoveries. The Covetous man marks, but
whom? those who are rich and wealthy. The
ambitious man, but whom? those that are
high and honourable. The lascivious man
marks, but whom? such as are beautiful and
wanton: few there be of <hi>Davids</hi> devout dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
who <hi>mark the Perfect, behold
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:46896:13"/>
the Vpright; for the end of that man is peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 <hi>Vse.</hi> Let all who desire this peaceable
end, labour whilest living to list themselves
in the number of those who are <hi>perfect</hi> and
<hi>upright.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>King <hi>Ahaaz</hi> coming to <hi>Damascus,</hi> was so
highly affected with an Idolatrous <hi>Altar</hi> which
he there beheld, that he needs would have
that Original Copyed out, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 16. 10.
And the like made at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> according to
<hi>the fashion of it, and all the workmanship there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</hi>
Fool, to preferre the pattern of the infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
pit, before the pattern in the Mount. But
this his prophane action will afford us a pious
application.</p>
            <p>You that have marked the Just and beheld
the Upright, ought to be affected with the
piety of his life, cannot but be contented with
the peaceableness of his <hi>end.</hi> This therefore
do; Such who are pleased with the pattern
of his <hi>perfection</hi> and <hi>uprightness,</hi> go home, and
raise the like fabrick, erect the like structure
for all considerable particulars in your own
soul.</p>
            <p>Vain and wicked was the wish of <hi>Balaam,
Numb. 23. 10. Let me dye the death of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
and let my last end be like his.</hi> He would
<hi>commence per saltum,</hi> take the Degree of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,
without that of Holiness; like those
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:46896:14"/>
who will live <hi>Papists,</hi> that they may <hi>sin</hi> the
more freely; and dye <hi>Protestants,</hi> that they
may be <hi>saved</hi> the more certainly. But know
that it is an impossibility to graft a peaceable
death upon any other stock, but that of a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
life.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Vse.</hi> Let it retrenoh our censuring of the
final estate of those whom we know led god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
lives, and we see had shameful deaths. Let
us expound what seems doubtful at their
death, by what was clear in their life. A true
conclusion may sometimes be inferred from
false premises: but from true premises the
conclusion must ever be true. Possibly a
good life in the next world, may follow a bad
one in this; namely, where (though late) sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
repentance interposeth. But most certain
and necessary it is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that a good life here must
be crowned with a good condition hereafter.
What then though <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> lost his head
by <hi>Herods</hi> cruelty, he still <hi>held his head</hi> in the
<hi>Apostles</hi> phrase, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 19. By a lively faith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
his dependance on, and deriving life
and comfort from Jesus Christ, in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
he may be said to have dyed in peace.</p>
            <p>There is a sharp and bitter passage in <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
Luk.</hi> 9. 23. And yet if the same be sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with a word or two in my Text, it may
not only easily be swallowed, but also will
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:46896:14"/>
certainly be digested into wholsome nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
the words are these, <hi>and let him take
up his Cross daily and follow me.</hi> His Cross; some
will say, I could comfortably comport my
self to carry such a mans Cross, his is a slight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
a light, and easie; mine a high, a huge and
heavy Cross. Oh but children must not be
choosers of that rod wherewith they are to be
corrected; that is to be let alone unto the
discretion of their father. Men may fit cloaths,
but God doth fit Crosses for our backs: no
Cross will please him for thee to take up, but
<hi>thy Cross,</hi> only that which his providence hath
made thee the proprietarie thereof. Well
take it up, on this assurance, that the <hi>end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
shall be peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Take up thy Cross.</hi> Is it not enough that I be
passive, and patiently carry it when it is laid
upon me? What a Tyranny is this for me to
<hi>cross my self</hi> by <hi>taking up my own cross?</hi> But
God will have it so, thou <hi>must take it up:</hi> that
is, First thou must freely confess that nothing
hath befaln thee by chance or fortune, but by
Gods all-ordering Providence. Secondly,
Thou must acknowledge that all afflictions
imposed upon thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are the just punishment
of thy sins deserved by thee; if inflicted more
heavily, seeing all things is mercy which is on
this side of hel fire. This it is to <hi>take up thy cross</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:46896:15"/>
do it willingly, <hi>for it will be peace at the last.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The last is the worst word, <hi>Daily.</hi> Not
that God every day sends us a new affliction,
but he requires that every day we should put
on a habit of <hi>patience,</hi> to undergo whatsoever
cross is laid upon us. This I conceive to be <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>
meaning, <hi>Psal. 73. 14. and chastened eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
morning. Daily,</hi> superstitious Fryers never
esteem themselves ready till they have put on
their Crucifix, and religious Protestants must
never accompt themselves ready till they
have put on their cross.</p>

with many <hi>festivals,</hi> having no foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in <hi>Scripture,</hi> or ancient Church History.
One day they call the <hi>Exaltation of the Cross,</hi>
which is <hi>May</hi> 3. another the <hi>Invention of the
Cross,</hi> which is <hi>September</hi> 14. But we must
know there is one day of the <hi>Cross</hi> more, <hi>Day</hi>
which continueth from the beginning to the
end of the year, namely, the <hi>Assumption of the
Cross;</hi> every one must take it up daily, do it, &amp;
do it willingly, for the <hi>end thereof wil be peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet there is a fourth thing remaining
in the Text, when we have took up our Cross
we must follow Christ it is not enough to take
it up, and then stand still, as if suffering gave
us a <hi>supersedeas</hi> for doing; but God at the
same time will have our <hi>hands, back,</hi> and <hi>feet</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:46896:15"/>
of our <hi>soul</hi> exercised; <hi>hands</hi> to take up, <hi>back</hi>
to bear our <hi>Cross,</hi> and <hi>feet</hi> to follow him; and
happy it is for us, though we cannot go the
same pace, if we go the same <hi>path</hi> with our
<hi>Saviour;</hi> for the end thereof will be peace.</p>
            <p>O the amiableness of the word <hi>Peace!</hi> oh
the extensiveness of the word <hi>End! Peace?</hi>
what can be finer <hi>ware? End?</hi> what can be
larger <hi>measure?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The amiableness of Peace, especially to us,
who so long have prayed for it, and payed for
it, and sought for it, and fought for it, and yet
as yet in <hi>England</hi> have not attained it. For the
<hi>Tragoedy</hi> of our war is not ended, but the
<hi>scene</hi> thereof removed, and the Element only
altered from <hi>earth</hi> unto <hi>water.</hi> Surely had we
practised <hi>Davids</hi> precept, <hi>Psal. 34. 14. Eschew
evil and do good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> seek peace and ensue it,</hi> before
this time we had obtained our desire. It is to
be feared we have been too earnest prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of the last, and too slow performers of
the first part of the verse: great have been
our desires, but small our deeds for peace.
Had we <hi>eschewed evil and done good,</hi> God ere
this time, would have crowned our wishes
with the fruition of peace.</p>
            <p>The Marriners <hi>Act.</hi> 27. 30. (men skilful to
shift for themselves at Sea) had a private pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
for their own safety, namely, to quit their
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:46896:16"/>
crazie ship, (with the souldiers and passengers
therein,) and secretly to convey themselves
into the boat. But their design miscarried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
discovered by S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the souldiers, <hi>who
cut the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All men ought to have a publick spirit for the
general good of our Nation, the success where
of we leave to the al-managing providence of
the God of heaven and earth. But I hope it wil
be no treason against our State, and I am sure it
wil be safe for us, who are but private persons
to provide for the securing of our souls, and
to build a little Cock-boat, or smal Vessel of a
<hi>quiet conscience</hi> in our own <hi>hearts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> thereby
to escape to the Haven of our own Happiness?
We wish well to the great <hi>Ship</hi> of our whole
Nation, and will never desert it so, but that
our best prayers and desires shall go with it.
But however providence shall dispose thereof
we will stick to the petty Pinnace of Peace in
our own consciences. Sure I am, no souldiers
shall be able to cut the <hi>Cables,</hi> I mean no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
impression from <hi>without,</hi> shall disturb
or discompose the peace which is within us.</p>
            <p>O the extensiveness of the word <hi>End!</hi> It is
like the widows oyl, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 4. 6. Which mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed
to fill the number and bigness of all
Vessels brought unto it, so here bring dayes
weeks, months, years, myriads, millions of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:46896:16"/>
years end will fill them all, yet it self is never
filled, as being the endless end of eternity.</p>
            <p>We will conclude all with a passage of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbus,</hi>
when he first went to make discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of the new world. Long time had he sail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and seen nothing but Sea, insomuch as the
men and Marriners with him begun to muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
resolving to go no further, but return
home again. Here <hi>Columbus</hi> with good words
and fair language pacified them for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
perswading them to sail forward for one
month more. That month elapsed, he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intreated
them to hold out but 3 weeks lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger:
that three weeks expired, he humbly
and heartily sued unto them, that for his sake
they would sail on but 3 dayes more, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to comply with the Resolutions of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning,
in case that within those 3 dayes, no
encouragement to their contrary was disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.
Before the ending whereof they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scryed
<hi>fire,</hi> which was to them a demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that it was not subjected on water, and
w<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> invited them for the finding out of those
<hi>Islands,</hi> whereby others afterwards discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the whole <hi>Continent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whilest we live here below in our bodies,
and sail towards another world in our souls
and desires, we must expect to meet with
much disturbance in our distempered passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:46896:17"/>
yea, such as sometimes in the hour of
<hi>temptation</hi> will amount to a <hi>mutiny;</hi> and much
dishearten us when <hi>tost</hi> with the <hi>tempest </hi>
of afflictions we can <hi>make no land,</hi> discover no
hope of <hi>happiness.</hi> It must then be our work
to still and <hi>calm</hi> our <hi>passions,</hi> perswading them
to persevere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and patiently to proceed though
little hope appear for the present. Not tha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
with <hi>Columbus</hi> we should indent with our
souls to expect any set-time of years, months
or dayes, (this were <hi>unlawful,</hi> and with the
wicked, <hi>Psal. 78. 41. To limit the Holy One of
Israel</hi>) but <hi>indefinitely</hi> without any notation
of time: Let us till on our souls by degrees,
<hi>a while, a little while,</hi> yet a <hi>very little while</hi> to
depend on God, and go on in goodness. Then
at last a <hi>pillar of fire,</hi> a comfortable light of a
conscience cleared through the blood an<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
merits of Christ will appear unto us, not only
contenting us for the present, but directing us
for the future to that bliss and happiness en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
by the Subject of my Text, <hi>Mark the
Perfect, behold the Vpright; for the end of that
man is Peace.</hi> AMEN.</p>
