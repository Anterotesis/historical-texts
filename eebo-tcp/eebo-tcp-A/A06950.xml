         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:26941:4"/>
this in the same forme and methode as now it is, but the ouer hastie greedinesse of a selfe-hurting Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner, and the confusion of many Printers (one poore booke being mangled into diuers hands) did both so confound, and defeate all my better purposes, that I was compeld to giue way to their wils, and to suffer it to come forth with that mishapen and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract face which now it beareth; euery page being loaded with the Printers faults, and no way to saue their reputation, but by most wilful neglecting to fixe to any <hi>Errata.</hi> Well, for euery part of that booke (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting that of cures) the Printers faults excussed, I dare boldly defend it against either enuy, censure, or any preiudication; and though it be not the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or most perfect (for those fruites grow not on my tree,) yet it is such, and so sound as shall giue a ful satisfaction to euery indifferent and vpright iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. As for that part, (the booke of cures I meane) which my selfe must needes confesse, giueth not that ample satisfaction which I intended, I haue in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends thereof compiled this volume with such ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest care, practise and diligence, that I dare engage euen my best fortunes, that simplicity and ignorance it selfe (I meane such as neuer intermedled with this art in the whole circuit of their liues) shall not onely with good iudgement performe as great and as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible cures as the best Smith-farriers of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but also shall giue such substantiall reasons and vncontrollable accounts for whatsoeuer they do, (which yet neuer Smith that I knew was able to do) that not the best artist shall be able with vndoubted truth to refute them. And with this protestation and full assurance to euery well practizing reader of this
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:26941:4"/>
worke, I will proceede to my purpose, according to euery branch and head in the title.</p>
                     <p>It is most necessary then for euery man who shall endeuour himselfe to haue knowledge in this art, first to learne whereof and how a horses body is compounded, that according to the naturall compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition thereof, and the vnnaturall workings in those compositions, he may compound his medicines, and make them agreeable with the effects of his infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and not as our farriers do, many times vse one medicine for all inward diseases, and one salue for all sores.</p>
                     <p>Touching therefore the true composition of a horses body, you shall vnderstand that it is as the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of a man is, compounded of thirteene seuerall things, that is to say, seuen naturall and sixe not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; the seuen naturall are, <hi>Elements, Temperaments, Humours, Members, Powers</hi> or <hi>Vertues, Actions</hi> or <hi>Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,</hi> and <hi>Spirits</hi>; all which be called naturall, because the naturall profession and excellency of euery sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble body, doth wholly depend vpon them, and hath his mouing no longer then they haue power of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. The sixe which are not naturall, be the <hi>Aire, Meate</hi> and <hi>Drinke, Motion</hi> and <hi>Rest, Sleepe</hi> and <hi>VVatch, Emptinesse</hi> and <hi>Fulnes,</hi> and the <hi>Affects</hi> or <hi>motions</hi> of the minde; and these are called not naturall, because as (being rightly and in due order applyed) they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue, sustaine, and fortifie the body; so being misgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned, or vsed in any excesse or disorder, they are the onely corrupt destroyers of the whole body: and of these thirteene simples which compound the fabricke or whole frame of the body, I intend to speake seuerally.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. 2. Of the foure Elements, their vertues and operations.</head>
                     <p>FIrst, for the exposition of this word <hi>Element,</hi> you shall vnderstand that it is the primere or first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of things, being of it selfe pure, vncorrupt and simple; all things being first made thereof, and all things at the last being resolued into the same againe. It is also in it owne nature so bright, cleare, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out contraction or impurity, that it is not to be discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by any sensible eye whatsoeuer. Lastly, it is the least part or <hi>Atomie</hi> of that thing which is made, or proceedeth from it.</p>
                     <p>Now of these elements which are the vsuall first mouers or beginners of all mouing things, there are onely foure in number, that is to say: <hi>Fire, Aire, Water</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi>; meaning not that fire, aire, water and earth, which is visible here with vs beneath, and which through the grossenes thereof, is both palpable and to be discerned; but those which are mounted aloft, and through their purity inuisible, and concealed from vs, (for the other are compounded bodies and not simple) And of these perfect and distinct elements you shall know, that the fire is the highest, as being fixed or ioyned next vnto the Moone, being hot and drye, yet naturally exceeding or being most predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant or ruling in heate.</p>
                     <p>The aire is placed next vnto the fire, and is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally light and hot, yet his predominant or chiefe quality is moist.</p>
                     <p>The water is adioyned vnto the ayre, the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition thereof, being heauy and moist, but his predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:26941:5"/>
or chiefe quality onely cold.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, the earth adioyned to the water, is the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, and it is most heauy and cold; but the predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant or chiefe quality thereof is onely drinesse.</p>
                     <p>Now for the vertues, properties, and operations of these foure elements, you shall vnderstand, that first the fire by meanes of his heate, moueth matter to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, and stirreth vp warmth in all liuing things; it is that which the <hi>Philosophers</hi> call <hi>Heterogenia,</hi> which is in mixt bodies to separate things of diuers kindes, one from another, and also to ioyne things of like kindes together, which they likewise call <hi>Homogenia.</hi> For by vertue of the fire, the bones of horses are sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the flesh, the flesh from the sinewes, the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes from the veines, the veines from the arteries, the heart from the liuer, the liuer from the spleene, and so forth, in such sort as we see the diuers parts of the fuell we burne, by the vertue of the fire and heate to be separated and deuided one from another, as the vapour from the smoake, the smoake from the flame, and the flame from the ashes. And as in these things, so in many other things, as in the tryall of mettals and such like, where the fire by vertue of his heate, sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth body from body, that is, mettall from mettall, and corruption from incorruption, gathering and knitting together euery thing of one and the selfe same kinde. Besides, the vertue of the fire is to ripen, order and digest things raw and vndigested, mingling the dry with the moist, and opening the powers that the aire being somewhat more solide and grosse, may enter into the body; and lastly, it breatheth and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth the coldnesse of the water and the earth, so that it may not distemper or confound the body.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="6" facs="tcp:26941:6"/>Touching the vertue and operation of the aire, you shall vnderstand that by the moistnesse thereof it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the matter apt to receiue shape either naturall or accidentall, and by the helpe and assistance of the fire, bringeth the powers and influences of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens and starres into the inferour bodies, making the mixt bodies, not onely subtile and penetrable, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so light and mounting, to the end they may neither be too grosse nor too heauy. Secondly, the ayre through his moistnesse cooleth the burning heate of the heart, liuer and intrails, as we dayly see by the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the lights and lungs, which like a paire of bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes draweth vncessantly fresh ayre vnto the heart and inward members. And albeit the ayre doth not seeme to the sence of our outward eyes, to bee any thing neare so moist as the water, yet according to the opinions both of our bookes and best Physitions, it it is by much the moister; which is well proued, say they, by the abundant fluxe it containeth, which fluxe spreadeth it selfe so farre abroad in the body, that it fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth euery empty part and corner thereof with the speciall properties and characters of moistnesse; and by that reason is much harder to be kept within his owne bounds then the water is. Lastly, as the water was altered by God from his first naturall place, for the better profite both of man and beast, euen so the ayre, according to Schoole-mens opinions was not left altogether in his first naturall disposition, lest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ouermoist it should so confound and suffocate all sence, that neither man nor beast should be able to breathe or liue.</p>
                     <p>Now for the vertue and operation of the water, it is to be noted that through the coldnesse thereof, it
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:26941:6"/>
conglutinateth and bindeth in mixt bodies, both parts &amp; members together, which be of diuers kinds, as bones with flesh and sinewes, flesh with sinewes &amp; bones, and sinewes with bones and flesh. Euen as for a familiar example, we see in the time of any great frost, the strength of the cold how it bindeth things of diuers kinds together, bringing into one masse or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance both water, dirt, stones, strawes, stickes and leaues: the water also with its coldnesse, doth temper and coole the inflammation and heate of the fire, gathering together those thinges which otherwise the violent heate would disperse and scatter abroad.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, for the vertue and operation of the earth, it is through his drinesse in mixt bodies, so to harden and fixe them together, that they may retaine their shapes, which otherwise by the power of the ayre and water, would be so soluble and loose, that they could not hold together; as we may see in paste, waxe, and such like, which whilest it is moist will receiue no print, but being once hardened it retaineth any forme that is prest into it. And here to be noted, that according to the opinion of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> when any sensible body dyeth, not onely euery quality but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery substance and part makes his returne to the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from whence it came; as heate to the fire, moist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to the ayre, coldnesse to the water, &amp; drinesse to the earth. And thus briefly you see, that of these foure common elements or common beginners of things, the fire being hot separateth, the aire being moist shapeth, the water being cold bindeth, and the earth being dry hardeneth and retaineth. The vse that you are to make of this knowledge, ouer and beside the composition of a naturall body, is, that when you
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:26941:7"/>
find any sicknesse or infirmity which proceedeth from the fire, as inflammations of the body, or such like; that then you apply simples of the nature of the aire or water, which may moisten and coole the violence of that heate. If the infirmity proceede from the aire, as fluxe of blood, or too much moisture; then you shall apply simples of the nature of the fire or earth, whose heate and drinesse may disperse and harden such moisture. If the disease spring from the water, as colds, rheumes, apoplexies and such like, then you shall seeke simples of the nature of the fire and aire; that through the heate of the one, and the moist light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the other, all such cold, grosse and solide hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors may be dispersed. But if the disease proceed from the earth, as manginesse, and leprosie, or their like that are dry &amp; hardened infections, then you shal seeke sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the nature of the fire onely, whose heate may dissolue &amp; loosen those ill knit, dry, and hard humors. Thus you see too much heate is abated by coldnesse and moistnesse, too much moistnesse by heate and drinesse, too much coldnesse by heate and moistnesse, too much drinesse by heate onely.</p>
                     <p>Thus much of these foure common elements, which begin all things liuing and vnliuing, sensible and vnsensible; yet of sensible things which liue and haue bloud, there be other more neare elements or beginnings, which are called proper elements or generation, as the ingendring seede, and menstruall bloud, from whence euery beast taketh his first shape and beginning; and yet these proper beginnings haue their whole dependancy and hanging vpon the qualities of the first common beginnings already spoken of, which is moist, dry, hot and cold; for
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:26941:7"/>
without them they are nothing, nor can do any thing.</p>

Now the equall temperament is diuided into two, an vniuersall and a speciall. The equall <hi>Temperament</hi> vniuersall, is when the foure elements are in an equall proportion, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally diuided through the whole body, nature en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyning no more from the one then from the other. The equall <hi>Temperament</hi> special, is when the elements are proportioned according as euery kind doth most properly require, be it either plant or beast: in plants, when euery plant hath that commixture of elements which are proper to its kinde, the hot plant being hot, the cold being cold, and so forth: whereas contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, to haue a hot plant cold, or a cold hot, to haue rue cold, or sorrell hot, were a false and vnequal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture of elements.

by his actions or motions. As thus, the horse is known to be hot and m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And so long as either horse or any other thing, continueth in the mediocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and excellencie of his proper <hi>Temperament,</hi> so long we may truly iudge him of a good temper &amp; dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but if there be any ouerflow of qualities, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse in his humors, as either in heate, coldnesse, moist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse or drinesse, then we say, he is either a hot chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke horse, a cold dull horse, a dry mischieuous horse, or a moyst cowardly horse, according to the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow of that quality which raigneth in him.</p>
                     <p>Againe, euery horse is sayd to haue his due <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament</hi> according to his age, and the country where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he is bred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and sometimes according to the time of the yeare wherein he liueth.

                        </gap>-age, which is till he be sixe yeares old, is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally hot and moist. In his middle age, which is till twelue, more hot and dry then moist; and in his old age, which is past eighteene, more cold and dry, then either hot or moist. So likewise the horses which are bred in southerne parts, as either in <hi>Spaine, Barbary,</hi> or <hi>Greece</hi> are naturally more hot then those which are bred either in the seuenteene lands, <hi>Germany,</hi> or <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>; either is there any horse which is in good state of body, that is so hot in the spring time of the yeare, as in the summer, nor so cold in the summer as in the winter. All which obseruations are with most curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diligence to be obserued of euery horse-leach, when he goeth about to cure any sicknes: for vnlesse he consider their natures &amp; temperatures, and euery
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:26941:8"/>
other circumstance already declared, he shall right soone be deceiued in the administration of his phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke. Therfore I earnestly aduise euery Farrier, before he giue any drench or potion, first to enquire the kinde, race, and disposition of the horse, next his age, then the country, and lastly the time of the yeare: and so according to the truth thereof, to mixe his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts.</p>
                     <p>It is most expedient also for euery horse-leach to consider the second qualities, which are so called, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they take their beginnings from the first quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties already declared; of which second qualities some be called palpable, or to be touched, as these, soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, hardnesse, smoothnesse, roughnesse, toughnesse, brickelnesse, lightnesse, heauinesse, thinnesse, thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, smalnesse, grosnesse, and such other like. Some againe are not palpable, as those which appertaine to hearing seeing and smelling, as noysses, colours, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours and such like; and by obseruing well these se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond qualities, he shall with much ease, know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the horse be disposed to any sicknes or not, as shall be more largely declared hereafter in euery par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular chapter.</p>

                        </gap>ower and heauy, as participating of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments water and earth: so that these foure humours by their qualities, are euery way allied vnto the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For to speake briefly, and according to the manner of Physitions, <hi>Bloud</hi> is of the nature of aire, it being most predominant therein; <hi>Fleame</hi> of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of water, <hi>Choler</hi> of the nature of fire, and <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly</hi> of the nature of the earth. And albeit these hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours are simbolized or mixt through euery part of the body; yet euery one of them, aboundeth more in one part then in another, and haue their places of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence absolute and peculiar to themselues, as <hi>Bloud</hi> about the heart, <hi>Fleame</hi> in the braine, <hi>Choler</hi> in the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and <hi>Melancholy</hi> in the spleene. Now as these hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors do more or lesse abound, or haue greater or les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser soueraignty in the body of the horse: so is the beast naturally better or worse coloured, qualified or dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, as thus. That horse in whom bloud hath the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test predominance, &amp; may be called a horse sanguine, is bright bay of colour, and in disposition pleasant, nimble, and of temperate or moderate motion. That horse in whom fleame hath the greatest dominion, and may be called a flegmatike horse, is for the most part, of a milke white colour, and so consequently slow, dull and heauy. If choler beare the greatest rule in his constitution, then is his colour commonly a bright sorrell, and by that meanes of disposition hot, fiery,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:26941:9"/>
and of little strength. Lastly, if the earth haue got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten power aboue the other elements, so that he may be called a melancholy horse, then is his colour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly a mouse dunne, and his disposition cowardly, faint and slothfull. But because these particularities are properly appertaining to the complexions of horses, of which we shall haue cause to speake more largely hereafter, I will not stand vpon any greater relation; onely I giue you thus much in conclusion: to vnderstand that euery one of these aforesaid hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours hath his proper vse or end, whereunto it ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, as thus. <hi>Bloud</hi> serueth most properly to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish the body. <hi>Fleame</hi> giueth motion to the ioynts. <hi>Choler</hi> prouoketh the auoydance of excrements, and <hi>Melancholy</hi> begetteth an appetite or longing to his meate. Now during the time that these humours do possesse their naturall qualities, so long they are wholesome, and bee called by their simple names, without glosse or addition; but if by any mischance they be disordered or corrupted, then they are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholesome, and are no longer called by their simple names, but haue other epithetons annexed vnto them, as <hi>Melancholy Bloud, Salt Fleame, Choler adust</hi> or <hi>Burnt Choler,</hi> and <hi>fretting Melancholy,</hi> whereof proceedeth many pestilent and dangerous diseases, as shall be at large declared hereafter.

all the parts of the body. The <hi>Power vitall</hi> is a vertue belonging to the heart, which doth giue life and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to all the body by meanes of the arteries; which proceeding from the heart, which is the chiefe foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of naturall heate, carries in their little channels ouer the whole body, that aire and spirituall bloud which makes it full of lightnesse and alacrity. The <hi>Power naturall</hi> is a vertue belonging to the liuer which giues nourishment vnto all the body, and to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part thereof, by meanes of the veines, which do likewise proceede from the liuer like greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duites, carrying the bloud from the liuer which is the fountaine of bloud, into euery part of the body. Besides the <hi>Power naturall</hi> containeth foure other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, that is, the vertue attractiue which draweth food meete to sustaine the body; the vertue retentiue, by which it retaineth and keepeth the foode receiued: the vertue disgestiue whereby it concocteth and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesteth the same.

Thus these powers or vertues being of no lesse validity then you perceiue by this discourse. it is the part and duty of euery good Horse-leach, to haue a most carefull and vigilant respect vnto them: for if any of them faile, the horse cannot liue.

                     <head>CHAP. 7. Of Actions or Operations, and whereto they belong.</head>
                     <p>AS touching <hi>Actions</hi> or <hi>operations,</hi> which are the sixt columne or pillar which doth vphold this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall body of which we treate, they are not onely belonging, but euen deriued from the three powers immediatly spoken of in the former chapter, as thus. The action and operation of the <hi>Power animall,</hi> is to discerne, to moue, and to feele. Horses discerne by meanes of the vertue <hi>Imaginatiue, Discoursatiue,</hi> and <hi>Memoratiue,</hi> whereof the first is placed in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, the second in the middle of the braine, and the third in the hinder part of the head. All which are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended vnder the <hi>Power animall.</hi> Horses moue by meanes of the vertue <hi>Motiue,</hi> whose action &amp; operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is to straine or let slacke the sinewes, whereby eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry member hath his mouing. And horses feeling is by meanes of the vertue <hi>Sensitiue,</hi> whose action or opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is busied in the fiue sences, as to <hi>See, Heare, Smell, Tast,</hi> and <hi>Touch</hi>; and all these actions spring from the <hi>Power animall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The action or operation of the <hi>Power vitall,</hi> is to restraine and loosen the heart, and the arteries, which proceede from the heart, which action whether it be hurt or disturbed in a horses body is easily knowne of euery good Farrier or horse <hi>Marshall</hi> by the vnequall beating of his pulse, that is to say of the arteries which cometh downe from the heart, to the insides of both his fore legges, a little below the knuckles of his shoulders, and likewise crosse both the temples of his head, a little higher then his eyes. And if any
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:26941:12"/>
man be so simple to imagine that the thicknesse of the horses skinne shall be any impediment to the feeling of this motion, let him remember that as a horses skin is thicker then a mans, so also are his arteries greater, and beate with more violence; and so consequently to be felt without any great difficulty.</p>
                     <p>The actions or operations of the <hi>Power naturall,</hi> are to <hi>ingender,</hi> to <hi>increase,</hi> to <hi>nourish,</hi> to <hi>desire with appetite,</hi> to <hi>attract,</hi> to <hi>change,</hi> to <hi>disgest,</hi> to <hi>retaine</hi> and to <hi>expell,</hi> and many others of like kinde. These actions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are carefully to be looked vnto by euery Farrier, to the intent that he may learne by them, not only the whole state of a horses body, but also what particular member thereof is euill affected, as thus. If either in your horse you finde much forgetfulnesse, vnnimble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his limbes, or dulnesse vpon correction, it is a signe of sicknesse in the braine, and that the <hi>Power ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal</hi> is euillaffected. If you find that his pulses do beate extraordinarily flow, or much to fast, it is a signe that his heart is grieued, and his <hi>Power vitall</hi> euill affected; but if you finde that he doth consume, pine away, &amp; loseth his stomacke, it is a signe that his liuer is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed, all his inward parts out of frame, and his <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er naturall</hi> euill affected.</p>
                     <p>Now you shall againe vnderstand that of actions some be voluntary, some not voluntary.</p>
                     <p>The voluntary actions be those which a horse may either further or hinder, stay or let when themselues pleaseth, as the mouing of the legges: for they may go, stand, or lye downe, at their owne plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
                     <p>The actions not voluntary, are those which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend not vpon the will of any beast, but be done of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:26941:12"/>
their owne accord and naturally, as the mouing of the heart and of the arteries, and the passage of the bloud: the first whereof beateth sleeping and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; and the other hath his course euery minute. And thus much of actions and operations.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. 8. Of Spirits, and in what parts of the horses body they remaine.</head>
                     <p>SPirits, which is the seuenth naturall builder of this naturall worke, are to be vnderstood to be that fine, pure, cleare, and ayrie substance which is ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of the finest part of the bloud, whereby the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of euery principall member may visite all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of the body, making them to do their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties according to the rules of nature. Now of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, according to the opinion of some Physitians, there are but two kinds, that is, the <hi>Spirit animall</hi> and the <hi>Spirit vitall.</hi> The <hi>Spirit animall</hi> is that which giueth power of feeling and mouing to a horse, and hath his resting place in the braine, from whence through the sinewes it is dispersed into all other parts of the body; and as it is ingendred of the vitall spirit, being more vehemently wrought and laboured, and partly of continuall breathing: euen so it is partly preserued by the <hi>Chaule</hi> of the braine, which doth howrely wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and nourish it.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Spirit vitall</hi> is contained in the heart, from whence it floweth into euery part of the body, being the chiefe cause of all naturall heate; and it is preserued and nourished, both by breathing and bloud.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="20" facs="tcp:26941:13"/>To these two spirits, there be some Farriers, both <hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> which adde a third spirit, and call it the <hi>Spirit naturall,</hi> saying, it hath its residence in the liuer &amp; the veines; but the two former are of such power, and haue such superiority, that the body can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not liue without them, nor haue any being at all; wherefore it is the office of the Farrier continually in all his medicines to haue euer some comfortable sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which may maintaine and keepe these spirits in their full strength, liuelyhood and vertue. And thus much touching spirits, &amp; those seuen naturall things which compact a naturall body.</p>

                     <head>Chap. 9. Of the sixe thing not naturall, how they profit, and how they hurt.</head>
                     <p>HAuing spoken of the naturall things whereof a horses body is compounded, it is needfull now that we speake something of the other sixe which be not naturall, so farre forth as they concerne the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Farrier and no further: for with other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters we haue not to do. The first thing then which is not naturall, yet preserueth a horses body in good state, is the aire, which being pure, sharp, cleare and piercing, giueth great life and nourishment to a horse, but being contrary, that is, grosse, thicke, and full of putrifaction, it cannot chuse but alter the good ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of his body, and breede in him many infirmities. Therefore euery Farrier shall haue great respect to the aire wherein a horse either liueth or was bred in, as if a horse that was bred in a hot aire, come to liue in a cold, and through that exchange grow sicke,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:26941:13"/>
the Farrier shall by warme dyet, close house, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate cloathing, bring his nature to a stronger ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance: also when a horse exceedeth in any of the foure qualities, that is, in heate, moystnesse, coldnesse, or drinesse, it is best for him to, liue in that aire which is contrary to that quality wherein hee exceedeth. Lastly, in many diseases, the change of the aire is most wholesome, as shall be shewed at large in the particular diseases.</p>
                     <p>For the meate and drinke of a horse which is the second thing not naturall in a horses composition, it is not to be doubted but whilest it is sweete, cleane, &amp; good, as bread well made and baked, dry oates, dry beanes, dry pease, sweet hay, sweet straw, or short grasse, so long it nourisheth and preserueth the horses body; but if it bee fully, raw, corrupt and vncleane, or if he eate tares, fitches, rye, or barley, then must hee needes bee vnsound and full of infirmities. Therefore the Farrier shall be carefull to keepe him from all such foodes as breede naughty euill bloud; as for his water, the more pure it is, the better, and the more muddy, thicke and pleasant, so much the more vnhealthfull.</p>
                     <p>Now for his mouing and rest, that is either his tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell or standing still, which is the third thing not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall in a horses composition, doubtlesse they be great preseruers of a horses health: for as moderate exercise dissolueth grosse humours, ingendreth appetite, and addeth strength vnto the limbes, so likewise indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent rest, causeth disgestion, comforteth the sinewes, &amp; maketh the heart cheareful against ensuing labour. But on the contrary part, immoderate trauell or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise, when a horse is ridden beyond his strength,

                        <pb n="22" facs="tcp:26941:15"/>
breedeth many dangerous &amp; mortall sicknesses, as the foundring in the body, the consumption of the lungs and liuer, molten grease and such like, besides the pis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of bloud, manginesse, farrye, and such like; all which inward diseases craue strong purges, and the outward sharp and correding medicines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Immoderate rest, which is when a horse doth stand long still with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any exercise. Feeding foule and grosly is as great an enemy to a horses health as the other: for it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregateth &amp; bindeth together all sorts of ill humours, breedes corruption in the bloud, rottennesse in the flesh, &amp; generally as many diseases as any il dyet what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer.</p>
                     <p>The sleepe or watch of a horse (which is the fourth thing in our composition) is so necessary a comfort to a horse, that he cannot liue without it; it is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test mouer of disgestion: and so consequently giues comfort to the whole body. For whilest a horse slee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth, the <hi>Powers animall</hi> do take their rest, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise would be ouer-wearied, and neither able to discharge their duties, nor to continue their actions and operations, which is the giuing of feeling and mouing only: &amp; whilst a horse doth sleep the powers natural haue more liberty to do their work, in conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the meate, and comforting the bodie; in so much that I account sleepe to be the onely quieting of the sences, ordained by nature to ingender strength. Sleepe is begotten by sweet, fatty and grosse vapours, (&amp; not by their contraries) which are raised from the heart to the braine; with the coldnesse of which braine those vapours being congealed and thickned together do stop the pipes of the sensitiue spirits, so as they can not resort to the instruments of the sences, to giue the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:26941:15"/>
body feeling &amp; mouing, wherby the body at that time is depriued of those motions. And according as those vapours do more or lesse fill the pipes, so is the horses sleepe more or lesse found and vndisturbed; but when this sleepe shall at any time grow into excesse, and you shall perceiue a horse to sleepe beyond both na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and custome, then you shall know that such sleep cometh from an euill habite of the body, and is a signe either of <hi>Lethargie,</hi> and a numbnesse of the spirits, or else that he hath some inward griefe and paine in his limbes when he standeth; which being eased by ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, makes him couet a continuall rest and sleeping. Now for the watch of a horse, because it is the meere contrary to sleepe, there needes little to be sayd more then this: that as the excesse of the one sheweth the want of the other, so the vnnaturall working of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shewes the euill state of a horses body, and giues the Farriers warning to expect ensuing sicknesse.</p>
                     <p>Now for emptinesse and fulnesse (which is the fift not naturall compositor) for as much as it is onely an adding to, and a taking away, some Farriers haue held opinion, that all Physicke belonging to a horses body, consisteth in them two onely; and truly I am of this minde, that whosoeuer can take away corruption, and adde perfection, shall without doubt, euer keepe an able and substantiall body. But to our purpose, of this fulnesse there are two sorts, the one fulnesse by excesse of humors, the other fulnesse by excesse of meate; either of which perturbing the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are the grounds of sicknes. Againe, excesse of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours are of two kindes, the one an equall encrease of all maner of humours gathered together, and the other a particular excesse either of too much <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:26941:16"/>
Fleame,</hi> or other waterish humours whatsoeuer, the first being termed an aboundance of humours, the latter an excesse of euill iuice or nutriment: last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, their fulnesse in quantity, and fulnesse in quality. Fulnesse in quantity is when a horse is full of bloud or any other simple humour. Fulnesse in quality is when any of those humors is too hot or too cold, too grosse or too thin. Now for emptinesse, as all diseases of fulnesse must be cured by it onely, so all diseases of emptinesse must be healed by fulnesse, as by taking of bloud, by purge, friction, scarification, boxing, swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, bathing, and a world of such like, as shal be very largely set forth hereafter.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, touching the affections of a horses minde, you shall vnderstand that so farre forth as the sensitiue soule doth stretch, so farre they haue sence and feeling of affections, as namely to loue, to hate, to be angry, to reioyce, to be sorry, and to feare: for all which, there needs no great apologie, sith we haue it in dayly experience: as who seeth not the loue of some horses to their keepers, their hate to strangers, their anger in their fights, their ioyes in their prides &amp; wooings, their sorrowes in their sicknesses, and their feares vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their riders? Now these affections sith many times they are the grounds of strange motions in the body; therefore they ought carefully to be looked vnto by the Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rier, and that the horse be not ouer-oppressed with any of them; especially feare and hatred, the first whereof compelleth the bloud and spirits to flye to the inward parts, and to leaue the outward without sence or feeling, and the latter makes him to be vnquiet, fierce and raging; both together breedes distemperature in a horse, and those distemperatures
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:26941:16"/>
ingender mortal sicknesses. And thus much for these sixe things, being held not naturall in a horses com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. 10 Of Horses complexions.</head>
                     <p>HAuing spoken of whose thirteene naturall and not natural things, wherof a horses body is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, we will now in a somewhat more particular manner speake of the complexions of horses, which is one of the most necessary faces that a Farrier can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, both for the iudging of a horses infirmities, and also for the true compounding of his medicines for euery disease: therefore you shal first vnderstand that by the color of the horse you shal euer iudge his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion: for looke which of the elements is most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant in him, from that element we draw his complexion, as thus. If he participate more of the fire then of any of the other elements, then we hold him to be a cholericke horse, and his colour is either a bright sorrell, a cole blacke without any white, or an yron gray vnchangeable, that is, such a gray as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will euer turne to a daple gray, to a white or to a flea-bitten; and these horses are of nature light, hot, fiery, and seldome of any great strength: these horses are much subiect to pestilent feuers, yellowes, and inflammations of the liuer. Therefore euery Farrier shall be carefull in the composing of any medicine for such a horse, to purge choler; yet very moderately, and not with any extraordinary strength in the potion or drench: because the horse being in his best strength not reputed strong, should you apply any violent
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:26941:17"/>
thing to him, that little strength being abated, there were great danger in the confounding of the whole body.</p>
                     <p>If the horse participate more of the aire then of the other elements, then is he of a sanguine complexion, and his colour is either bright bay, or darke bay; which hath neither skouling countenance, mealy nose, nor white flanke, or a white flea-bitten, white lyard like siluer, or a blacke with white starre, white rache or white foote; these horses are of nature plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant, nimble, free, and of a good strength. The diseases to them most incident, is consumption of the liuer, leprosie, glanders, or any disease that is infectious. They are of a good strong constitution, and may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure strength in their medicines, especially any thing that cooleth the bloud.</p>
                     <p>If the horse participate more of the water then of the other elements, then is he of a flegmaticke com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, and his colour is either a milke white, a yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low dun, a kiteglewd or a pyedball, in whom there is an equall mixture of colours, that is, as much white as of the other color: otherwise if the bay, the blacke, or the dunne exceed the white, he is sayd to be of that complexion of which the color is greatest. These hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses are of nature slow, dull, and apt to leese flesh; the diseases which are most incident vnto them, is colds, head-atch, rheumes, staggers and such like. They are able to endure the reasonable strength of any medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine; because the abundance of fleame which is in them, sufficeth both nature and the potion to worke vpon: all cold simples are to them exceeding hurtfull, so are also they which are violently hot in the third degree; the first because it bindeth too soone; the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:26941:17"/>
because it disperseth too suddenly, therefore sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of a moderate meane are the best.</p>
                     <p>If the horse participate more of the earth then of the other elements, then is he of a melancholy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, and his colour is mouse dunne, russet, ches<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut, a sky gray, darke bay, with mayly nose, redde or white slanke, or a reddish bay, hauing long white haire, like goates haire growing on his legges. These horses are of nature heauy, and saint hearted: the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases to them most incident, is inflammations in the <hi>Spleene, Frenzie, Dropsie</hi> and such like. They are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly of better strength then they will suffer to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by their actions, and are able to endure the strength of any reasonable medicine: all cicatrizing and dry simples are hurtfull vnto them; the cold and moist are the most profitable.</p>
                     <p>Hauing thus shewed you these foure complexions, <hi>Cholerike, Sanguine, Flegmatike</hi> and <hi>Melancholy,</hi> together with their qualities and strengths, you shall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand now that amongst Farriers there is another com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, or fift constitution, which is called the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position or mixture of complexions, that is, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer a horse doth participate of all the foure ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments equally and in due proportion, none being greater or lesse then another; and this complexion of all other is the best and and most perfect; and the horse which is of this complexion, is euer of one of these colours, that is to say, either a faire browne bay, da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled or not dapled, a daple gray, a blacke, full of sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haires, or a faire roane redde or blacke. And those horses are of nature most excellent, most temperate, strongest, gentlest, and most healthfull; though they may haue any disease, yet are they naturally inclined
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:26941:18"/>
to no disease; but what infirmity soeuer falleth vnto them is meerely accidentall, and not through any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerflow of naturall distemperature. All medicines must be compounded for them according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the sicknesse, and the time of their languish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for if their sicknesse be young and new bred, then are they able to receiue any well composed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt; but if it be old, &amp; the inward powers and facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties feebled, then you must bee carefull to helpe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by adding to euery medicine of what nature so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, some simple of comfort, that as euill humours be clensed, so strength may still be repayred &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. And thus much for complexions.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. 11. Of inward sicknesse, the causes and seuerall kindes thereof.</head>
                     <p>SIth I haue already passed ouer al those things which haue a naturall and perfect working in a horses bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and do maintaine, vphold and preserue the same in good state and health, except accidentally they be encountred and crossed by some excesse, or in dyet, or in exercise: it shall now be meete that we begin to speake of the things which be contrary and against nature, which are all those things whereby at any time, the healthfull estate of the horses body is any way impeached; and they be three in number, that is, the causes, the sicknesse, and the accidents which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low euery sicknesse.</p>
                     <p>Now the causes of sicknesse are all vnnaturall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and euill dispositions, which going before, do as it were by violence, bring sicknesse after them:
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:26941:18"/>
and of these causes there be two sorts, some internall, some externall; the internall be those which breede within the body of the horse, as euill humours, euill obstructions and euill iuice. Externall are they which communicate with the outward parts of the body, as heate, cold, wounds and such like, of which I shall speake more in the second booke: and for so much as I intend at the beginning of euery particular dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, to shew the cause of that disease, I will at this time speake no more of that subiect.</p>
                     <p>Now for sicknesse it selfe which is any thing that is contrary to nature, it is diuided into three generall kindes: the first an euill temperature, the second an euil state or composition, and the third a loosening or diuiding of an vnity. Now of these two latter, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not to speake in this place, because they apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to surgery, which I reserue for the second booke; but for the first kinde which is an euill temperature, it is taken two fold, that is, either simple or compound; simple, when one quality onely doth abound or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede, as to be too moist or too dry: compound when mo qualities then one do grow into excesse, as for a horse to be too hot, and too dry, or too cold and too moist. Againe, sicknesses are sayd some to belong, as consumptions, glanders and such like, which lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and weare a horse away by small degrees. Some short, as the staggers, yellowes, anticor, and such like, which as soone as they be perceiued, so soone they be mortall.</p>
                     <p>Now of inward sicknesses, some do occupy all the whole body, some but particular parts; those which occupy the whole body are feuers, the pestilence, conuulsions and such like: those which occupy parts
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:26941:19"/>
or members, are colds which annoy the head, sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faits which perplexe the stomacke; and so likewise all outward infirmities proper to euery particular mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as splents vpon the legs, spauens on the houghes, pearles in the eyes, and such like, as shall be amply shewed hereafter. And thus much for sicknesse and the seuerall kindes thereof.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. 12. Of the signes of sicknesse, and of what na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it consisteth.</head>
                     <p>THe signes and faces by which sicknesse is discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, are many, and almost numberlesse; yet in the best sort that I may, I will shew you such and so many as shall amply serue for any mans vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. Know then first that there be according to the rules in physicke, foure especiall wayes to iudge of inward and outward infirmities. First, by accidents, as by the shape, number, quantity, &amp; place of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber grieued: for if it carry not his true proportion, or be more or lesse in number or quantity, or out of his proper place, then questionlesse it is diseased. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by alteration of the quality, as when it is either too hot, too cold, too moist or too dry. Thirdly, when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny member in the body is hindered from doing his office; as when the eye cannot see, or the foote can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not treade: and fourthly, by excrements, as by his dung or his vrine. But for as much as in the specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of these qualities, many of the ignorant sort may be either amazed, distract or deceiued; and that my desire is to giue an absolute satisfaction to all sorts of people, I will briefly and plainly shew you the most
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:26941:19"/>
vndeceiueable signes of all sorts of inward sicknesses, as thus. If a horse be slower in labour, or duller in the spurre then he hath bene accustomed, if he be shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter breathed, if his eares hang downe more then they were wont; if his haire be more staring, if his flankes be more then vsually hollow, if he burne betwixt his eares or about his pasternes, if in trauell his stomacke faile him; or his mouth that in labor was vsually wont to be foaming, become dry; all these are most ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant signes of inward sicknesse.</p>
                     <p>When a horse holdeth downe his head which was wont to be of a chearefull countenance, it is a signe either of a feuer, head-ache, or else foundring in the body.</p>
                     <p>If a horse be dimme of sight that was cleare sigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it is a signe either of head-ache, the staggers, or sore eyes.</p>
                     <p>When a horse turneth his head backward to the place grieued, if it be to the right side<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is a signe of obstructions in the liuer; but if he turne it downe to his belly, then it is a signe either of cholericke, bots or wormes.</p>
                     <p>When a horse hath water running from his mouth, it is a signe of the staggers or the wet cough.</p>
                     <p>If a horses breath stincke, or foule matter issue from his nosthrels, it is a sign of an vlcer in the nose or head; but if the matter be white, then it is a signe of glaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: if the matter be blacke, then it is a signe of the mourning of the chine; but if the matter be yellow, then it betokens the consumption of the liuer; but if he cast little lumps out of his mouth, then it betokens the consumption or rottennesse of the lungs.</p>
                     <p>If a horses body and breath be hot, it is a signe of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:26941:20"/>
a feuer and heate of the stomacke, if therewithall he forsake his meate, it is a signe of inflammation in his liuer, and either of dry or moist yellowes.</p>
                     <p>If the temples of a horses heade be very hollow, it is a signe either of the strangle or old age.</p>
                     <p>Shortnesse of breath, and a breathing flanke, is a signe either of a feuer or the strangle; but if the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of the throate be stopped, it is a signe the filme of the lungs is broken, &amp; the spleene troubled, or else broken winded.</p>
                     <p>If any thing lye on both sides the forehead, which may be felt beate, it is a signe of the staggers.</p>
                     <p>If there be any swelling betweene the eares, it is a signe of the polle euil; swelling vnder the eare, a signe of the viues; and swelling in the mouth, a signe either of canker, flaps or lampasse.</p>
                     <p>Swelling vnder the throat is a signe of the glaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; and swelling about the tongue rootes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a signe of the strangle; but if there be about the tongue rootes, nothing but little small knots like waxe kyrnels, then it is a signe but of cold onely.</p>
                     <p>Swelling on the left side is a signe of a sicke spleene. Swelling in the belly and legges, a signe of the drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie; and swelling in the flanke, of the cholericke onely.</p>
                     <p>To cough, or to offer to cough, is a signe either of the glaunders, of the mourning of the chine, of a fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the weasand, of the wet or dry cough, of the filme broken, of the dry malady, of a consumption, or of foundring in the body.</p>
                     <p>Staggering is a signe either of a feuer, of the staggers, or of swaying in the necke; but if he stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or rolle behinde onely, then it is a signe either of foundring in the body, or of paine in the kidneyes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="33" facs="tcp:26941:20"/>Trembling is a signe of a feuer, or of foundring in the body: and here is to be noted, that a horse which trembleth after the drinking of cold water, hath during that time of trembling, a very certaine sit of an ague; and if any Farrier or other, will but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue it, he shall finde that the horse after he hath done trembling, will burne and glow in as great extremity at least an howre and an halfe after; and some horses after their burning, will sweate also.</p>
                     <p>The hollownesse of a horses backe is a signe of the dry malady or the dropsie.</p>
                     <p>Haire staring, is a signe either of a cold stomacke or of foundring in the body.</p>
                     <p>If a horse stale with much paine, it is a signe either of foundring in the body, the wind cholike, or the stone; and if the vrine which comes from him be yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, it is a signe of the glaunder; but if it be blackish and thicke, it is a signe of paine in the kidneyes.</p>
                     <p>Leannesse and gauntnesse is a signe of hide-bound, or of the consumption, of the dry malady, of foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring in the body, inflammation of the liuer, the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, cholicke or wormes.</p>
                     <p>Laxatiuenesse or loosnesse of the body, is a signe of a hot liuer.</p>
                     <p>Costiuenesse in the body is a signe of dry yellowes, or of diseases in the galle.</p>
                     <p>If a horses dung stinke, it is a signe of a hot liuer; if it haue no smell, then of a cold liuer; but if it be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disgested, then either of a consumption, or of a drye malady.</p>
                     <p>If a horse go stiffe, it is a signe either of wrinching, hipping, stifling or foundring either in body or legs; if he go crouching behinde and stiffe before, then the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:26941:21"/>
griefe is in his forelegges; but if he go onely weake behinde, then is the griefe in his hinder legges onely.</p>
                     <p>If a horse desire extraordinarily to lye downe on his right side, it is a signe of heate in the liuer. If on the left side, then of a diseased spleene; if he be oft vp and downe, finding no rest, then it is a signe of bottes, wormes, chollicke, or griping in the belly; if when he is downe he spreade himselfe abroad, it shewes the dropsie; if he groane when he is downe, it shewes ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a sicke spleene, moist yellowes, chollicke, bots, or filme broken; if he be not able to rise when he is downe, then either mortall weaknesse, foundring in the body or legges.</p>
                     <p>To be troubled with much wind is a signe either of griefe in the spleene, or losse of much bloud.</p>
                     <p>If a horse forsake his meate, it is a signe either of a feuer, head-ache, strangle, staggers, consumption, or dry malady, anticor, foundring in the body, a hot and consumed liuer, moyst yellowes, cholicke, or the wormes; but if when he forsaketh his prouender he doth, as it were, chauell or chaw a little hay, and in his chawing doth make a certaine sharp noyse in his mouth, and if his tongue could not well part from the roofe without a kinde of chanking, it is then a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine signe that the horse is troubled with the falling of the palate of the mouth, a disease which only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth by ouer much trauell, or too sore a burthen.</p>
                     <p>If a horse desire to eate much and drinke little, it is a signe of a cold liuer; but if he desire to drinke much and eate little, it is then a signe either of a feuer, rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten lungs, heate in the stomacke, heate in the liuer, or the dry yellowes.</p>
                     <p>If a horse both eate and drinke with an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:26941:21"/>
greedinesse, it is a signe of rotten lungs, or a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eased spleene.</p>
                     <p>Lazie and heauy going contrary to true nature, is a signe either of a feuer, sicke spleene, yellowes, or else obstructions of the liuer.</p>
                     <p>If a horse strike with his foote at his belly, it is a signe of the chollike; but if when he striketh, he fiske with his taile also, then is it either bots or rough wormes.</p>
                     <p>If a horse be scabby and vlcerous all ouer his body, or but about his necke, it is a signe of the mangie; if it be an vlcer full of knots, creeping alongst a veine, it is the farcy; if spreading abroad onely in one place, it is a canker; if the vlcer be hollow and crooked, it is a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stula, but if it be a spongie wart, full of bloud, it is then an <hi>Anburie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If a horses tongue hang out, and be swolne, it is a signe of the strangle.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, if a horse in health beate short, thicke, &amp; fast in the flanke, it is a signe of sicknesse in the lungs &amp; lights, which we call broken winded; with a world of other such like signes and tokens, as shall be more amply declared in euery particular chapter.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. 13. Generall obseruations in the Physicking of Horses.</head>
                     <p>AFter you can by these signes and characters iudge and approue either the health or sicknesse of a horse, it is then necessary that you learne some gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall rules and obseruations which belong to the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicking of a horse; lest that either by your rashnesse,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:26941:22"/>
vnskilfulnesse or vncleanlinesse in what you go about to do, you commit errours more grosse then the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine you administer hath power to do good. Know then first, that whensoeuer you go about to giue your horse any inward potion or drench, you must first take very carefull heede that your drinke be no more then milke warme: for there is nothing more mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall to a horse then the scalding of his stomacke. Next you must be very carefull that you giue the drench easily and gently, lest in making too much haste, the drinke passe into his weasand or winde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipe, and so force him to an extreme coughing, and almost suffocate him; which if it do, you must then let his head loose, and walke him vp and downe, till the passion be past. Lastly you shall obserue in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a drench, to draw out the horses tongue before you put in the horne, and then presently let it loose againe: for that will compell him to swallow whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he will or no. And this is principally to be vsed when you giue your horse pils, as butter and garlike, bulter and Saunders, or butter and sauen. Also euery drench will worke the better, the longer you keepe the sicke horse fasting, both before and after his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine; wherein is likewise to be obserued, that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate exercise (as gently walking, or trotting vp and downe according to the horses strength after his drench is receiued) is most wholesome, and maketh the medicine worke a great deale the better.</p>
                     <p>You shall likewise obserue if your horses sicknesse be a feuer, to mixe alwayes your simples either with warme water, with hony, or with oyle; but if the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease be coughes, rheumes or any thing that procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth of cold causes, then you shall mixe your simples
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:26941:22"/>
with good ale or wine; and if your horse be brought low &amp; weake with sicknesse, then you shall mixe your simples with milke or egges.</p>
                     <p>You shall also obserue that in bloud letting, you must take but halfe so much from a yong colt as from an old horse; and but the fourth part from a year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling foale: also in letting bloud, you must carefully regard the age and strength of your horse, taking more or lesse according to his ability of body. Lastly, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of bloud is either to diuert sicknesse and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue health, or to refresh and coole the spirits, or to diminish bloud, or else to purge grosse and badde humours.</p>
                     <p>Obserue before you let your horse bloud, first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately to chafe or exercise him; then let him take rest a day before his letting bloud, and three dayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; not forgetting that <hi>Aprill</hi> and <hi>October</hi> are the two principall seasons of the yeare for that purpose, except vrgent occsion be ministred.</p>
                     <p>Obserue whensoeuer you rake your horse with your hand (which is to draw his ordure out of his fundament when hee cannot dung) that then first you annoynt all your hand with sallet oyle; the like you must euer do when you put vp any suppositary; but when you administer any glister, you shall then but annoynt the glister pipe onely. Many other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruations there are which be more particular, and those you shall finde annexed to the seuerall cure of euery disease. Thus much then of these generall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruations.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. 14. Of the vrine and excrements of an horse.</head>
                     <p>AFter you haue made your memory acquainted with the signes and obseruations before specifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and so in the end finde a horse which by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration of some of these signes appeareth most certainly to be sicke and diseased; my aduice is then (if conueniently you may, and that the violence of the sicknesse do not vrge the contrary) that before you administer any thing vnto him, in any case you see his vrine, from which vrine you shall reape these knowledges.</p>
                     <p>First, if the vrine of a horse be of a pale, whitish, yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low colour, like vnto amber, &amp; therewithall somewhat strong smelling, and not very cleare, then you shall be assured that the horse is in good state of body, strong and healthful; but if it be extraordinary white, and as it were, creamy, then it is a signe the horse hath weake reines and is subiect to the stone, and the stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in the kidneyes.</p>
                     <p>If the vrine of a horse be somewhat high coloured, bright and cleare like lamber and not like amber, or like a cup of strong march beere; then it sheweth the horse hath inflammation in his bloud, and that he hath either a feuer, or else some great surfaite; but if it be red like bloud, then is his inflammation more geat, and his surfaite is onely an ouer heate taken by ouer-riding; insomuch that if present remedy be not applyed, either by scouring or other healthfull phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke, the horse cannot chuse but fall into some mortal sicknesse.</p>
                     <p>If the vrine of a horse be of a pale greenish colour,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:26941:23"/>
thicke and slimy, it is a signe of a weake backe, and consumption of the seede.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, if the horses vrine be high colored, yet there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall cloudy and full of blacknesse, then it is a signe that the horses sicknesse is mortall, and hardly to be preserued by any physicke; but if the blacknesse and cloudinesse of the vrine do not remaine, as it were, bound vp together in one body, but is broken &amp; dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed, shewing many cloudes in one water, then it is a signe that the violence of the sicknesse departeth away, and there is great hope, by good gouernement, that the horse will recouer his health, as at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>Now for the excrements or dung of a horse, which is no lesse worthy of note then the vrine. You shall first vnderstand, that if his dung be euer of alliance with his foode, I meane either in part or whole co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured like vnto that he eateth; as thus for example: If your horse go at grasse, his dung wil euer be greene, and the brighter such greennesse is, and being in a meane betweene hardnesse and softnsse, the sounder and in more perfect estate the horse standeth; but if the greennesse be bright, yet the ordure so soluble and loose, that it cometh from the horse like water, then you shall vnderstand that either the horse hath eaten vp some feather, or else that he hath an inward coldnesse both in his stomacke and bowels.</p>
                     <p>If a horses dung be of a reasonable thicknesse, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther too costiue nor too soluble, yet the greennesse inclined to some blacknesse, it is a signe that the horse hath a hot stomacke, and is easile subiect either to the yellowes or staggers.</p>
                     <p>If the horses dunge be in round hard pellets, and of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:26941:24"/>
a blackish greene colour, like the dung of a sheepe, or a Deere, then it is without faile that the horse hath had some great surfait, either by ouer-riding, or by ill food, or else is certainly possest either of the yellowes, or feuer, or foundred in the body.</p>
                     <p>Now if your horse be fed onely vpon straw, then his colour will be of a high coloured yellow, rather costiue then soluble, and the graine thereof long, and not well coutched together: and all these be good signes of great healthfulnesse; but if the colour be inclined to rednesse; or if it be exceeding dry with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out moisture, or if it be thinne like the dung of an Oxe or a cow, they be all apparant signes of inward sicknesse; but if the rednesse turne to blacknesse, and that his ordure doth leese the strength of its smelling, then it is a great signe of death and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality.</p>
                     <p>If your horse be fed with hay and prouender, then your perfect and sound dung will be of a browne yellow colour, the graine somewhat long, yet moist and well fixt together; but if the brownnesse turne to rednesse, it is a signe of distemperature; and if it turne to blacknesse, then of death. Now for the smell of this dung, you must vndestand that the more prouender you giue, the greater will be the smell, and the lesse prouender, the lesse smell.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, if you feede your horse onely vpon prouen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as bread, oates, and such like, then the dung which shewes a perfect and a sound body, will be of a pale yellow colour, like course hony, firme like a thicke salue, hauing within it when you tread vpon it, or break it, little white graines, like those which are in sope; or if the dung be harder, like the ordinary
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:26941:24"/>
ordure of a man, it is not amisse: for both be signes of health and strength; but if the dung looke redde, then it is a signe that the horse hath taken some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward heate, and his stomacke and bowels do rest still inflamed.</p>
                     <p>If his dung be browne and slimy, or if it shine and looke greasie, it is a signe that he hath had some of his inward grease molten, and that it resteth and putrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in his body; but if with his dung you see him void great clods and lumps of grease, then you may be assured that his grease was molten, but nature hath ouercome infirmity, and the worst danger is past already; but if his dung be matter vndigested, so that you may either perceiue therin whole corns or whole bits of bread, it is a signe the horse hath either taken a late surfaite, or is entring into a mortall consumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Lastly, if his dung be blacke, or haue lost the smell, it is an apparant signe of death. And thus much for vrine and excrements, and the seueral know<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>THat horses haue feuers, and those feuers of diuers and sundry natures, there is nothing more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, as by strict obseruation may daily be perceiued, especially when either we vse much trauell, or disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly diet: for questionlesse from these two and none other heads do spring most feuers whatsoeuer. But first, that I may giue you an account what a horses fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is, you shall know that it is an vnnaturall and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:26941:25"/>
immoderate heate, which proceeding first from the heart, disperseth it selfe not onely through all the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, but euen the veines of a horses body, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hindereth all the actions and wholesome mouings of the same. Now of feuers, some Farriers make three forts: the first those which breede in the spirits, being inflamed and set on fire beyond the ordinary course of nature: the second those which breede in the humours, being likewise distempered by heate: and the third those which breed in the firme parts of the body, and are continually hot. Now I for your better memory, will diuide them onely into two parts, that is to say: Ordinary and extraordinary. The ordinary feuers are all those which are bred either in the spirits or in the humours, as namely: <hi>Quotidians, Tertians, Quartans, Feuers continuall, Feuers Hectique, Feuers</hi> in <hi>Autumne, Sommer,</hi> or <hi>Winter.</hi> And the feuers extraordinary are all those which are bred in the firme parts of the body, and are euer hot, as <hi>Pestilent Feuers,</hi> and the <hi>Plague,</hi> which euer are accompanied with vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers; and the feuer accidentall, which proceedeth from the anguish and paine of some mortall wound.</p>
                     <p>Now for the causes from whence these feuers do proceede: you shall vnderstand that all these which I call ordinary feuers, do generally spring either from surfaite by extreme labour, or from surfaite by naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty meate, as raw pease, rawfitches, raw oates, mouldy and vnwholesome bread, and such like: sometimes they do proceede from the extreme violence and heate of the Sunnes beames, when trauelling with disorderly haste in the extremest heate of the day, those two heates mixing together, labor &amp; the Sunne, there cannot chuse but be bredde in the horse some
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:26941:25"/>
mortall inflammation: and for mine owne part I haue seene horses fall downe dead in the high way: for whose deaths I could find no reason more then their labour and the heate of the Sunne. Feuers sometimes spring from a contrary cause, as from extreme cold in this maner: when a horse in the Winter time hath bene trauelled sore all the day, and is brought into the house hot, if after his bloud and inward powers are setled and cooled, you then presently or the same night, giue him cold water as much as he will drinke, you shall see him out of hand fall into an extreme quaking, and from that quaking, into a violent burning, with all other distemperatures of a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.</p>
                     <p>Now for extraordinary feuers, they euer proceede either from corruption of bloud, or from infection of the aire; and albeit these feuers are not vsually knowne vnto our Farriers, yet they are as common as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; onely the violence of them is so great, and the poison so strong, that they euer carry with them some other mortall sicknes, as namely, <hi>Staggers, Yellowes, Anticor,</hi> and such like, which neuer are, but a pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent feuer euer goeth before them. And they, like the markes of the plague, are seldome seene till the cure be desperate; and then the vnskilfull Farrier, neither noting, nor knowing if he did note, the effects of the feuer, doth euer mis-baptise the name of the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses infirmity, and taking the lesser for the greater, failes many times to do the good office &amp; cure which he intendeth.</p>
                     <p>Now the signes to know a feuer be these: first he will euer hold downe his head, he will quake and tremble; but when his trembling is past, then will
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:26941:26"/>
his body burne, and his breath be hot, he wil breathe fast, and his flanke will beate; he will reele, he will forsake his meate, his eyes will be swolne and closed vp, yet therewithall much watring; his flesh will, as it were, fall from his bones, and his stones will hang downe low, he will oft lye downe, and oft rise vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; all his desire will be to drinke, yet at no time drinke much; neither will he at any time sleep. Now for the generall cure of these generall feuers, you shall vnderstand, that some Farriers vse to let the horse bloud in the face, temples and palate of the mouth, and the first day to giue him no meate, but warme drinke onely, by a little at a time, and after, the finest grasse or finest hay wet in water, keeping him warme, and often walking him vp and downe in a temperate aire, and giuing him good store of litter; then when he begins to mend, to feede him with barley sodden, huskt and beaten as you do wheate before you make furmity. And this cure is not amisse, for it agreeth with the ancient experience of the <hi>Italians</hi>; but in our English horses (through the clyme as I suppose) it often faileth.</p>
                     <p>The best cure therfore that I haue found is, as soone as you perceiue him to begin to shake, to giue him the yolkes of three or foure egges, beaten with seuen or eight spoonefull of aqua-vitae to drinke; and then chase him vp and downe till his shaking be past, and then set him vp close and warme, and with many clothes make him sweate an howre: let his foode be oates very well dryed and sifted, and one day some washt in ale. If his shaking fit be past before you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue his sicknesse, you shall onely giue him a pint of <hi>Muskadine,</hi> and an ounce of sugar-candy beaten to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:26941:26"/>
powder, and brewd together, to drinke, and so let him rest, feeding him by little and little as aforesaid, and giuing him no water but such as is warme; and this order you shall obserue at the beginning of euery fit if you can note them, or else euery morning if his sicknesse haue no ceassing.</p>

                     <p>THe <hi>Quotidian</hi> or one dayes feuer is that which ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a horse, and holdeth him with one fit once euery day; it will at first appeare somewat violent, but seldome or neuer endureth long, if the Farrier haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny discretion. It proceedeth most commonly from extreme riding, either after water or a full stomacke; and then suddenly after his heate, being thrust into a stable, &amp; neither stopt nor rubbed, a suddaine coldnes to that suddaine heate begers a shaking, and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the effects of a feuer.</p>
                     <p>The signes to know it, are watrish and bloud-shot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten eyes, short and hot breathing, panting, loathing of his meate, and stiffnesse in his limbes; but aboue these, to know it is a <hi>Quotidian,</hi> you shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue that these signes together with the sicknesse, will not last aboue sixe or eight howres in one day, and then he will be cheerefull and in health againe, till very neare the same howre of the next day, at what time his fit will begin againe. And here is to be noted, that the more it altereth the howres, the more hope there is of his health, as if it take him at se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of the clocke of the one day, and at three of the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:26941:27"/>

The cure is: You shall only during his fit, giue him nothing but a sweet mash made of malt and water being luke warme, and walke him gently vp and downe in a temperate aire; then as soone as his fit is past, you shall set him vp, and rub his body &amp; legs exceedingly: then foure howres after, you shall giue him this drinke. Take of strong ale a quart, and boyle therin halfe a handfull of worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, of long pepper and graines two ounces, of the best treacle two ounces, and of the powder of dryed rue one ounce: now when a third part of the ale is consumed, take it from the fire and straine it; then put therein three ounces of sugar-candy, beaten to powder; then when it is luke warme giue it him with a horne to drinke. Do this twice at the least, or thrice if his fits continue, and there is no doubt but he will recouer.</p>

                     <p>THe <hi>Hectique</hi> feuer in horses, is a dangerous and mortall feuer, being in a horse the first originall breeder of a consumption; it is a certaine hot and dry humour, which runneth betweene the skinne and the flesh, proceeding from a sicke stomacke, which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing bene scalded with hot drinks (as those ill dyeted running horses be, which feede vpon much spice, or those which take hot drenches vpon euery foolish and sleight occasion) hath almost cleane lost the power of disgestion: it sometimes happens to those horses which men too carefully teaching to drinke beere and wine, do so conti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The signes to know it is: the horse will neuer eate with any appetite, and when you draw out his tongue you shall finde it rawe and almost scalded; his flesh wil be loose and flaggy, and his body will be subiect to a continual trembling. The cure is, first wash his tongue either with the sirrop of mulberries, or with allome, running water, sage, and woodbinde leaues boiled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; then giue him fasting in a morning, this drink. Take of aloes one ounce, of agarike halfe an ounce, of licoras and aniseseeds of each a dram, beaten to pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, &amp; let him drinke it with a quart of white wine, luke warme, &amp; made sweet with sugarcandy or hony; let him drinke no drinke but warme mashes of malt &amp; water, and let his meate be sweete bay, or greene corne blades; and euer after his medicine l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>ALl these feuers before spoken of, do for the most part, commonly happen to horses in the spring time of the yeare, by reason that the new bloud is euer aptest to be inflamed; yet notwithstanding we finde by experience, that feuers will somtimes come at the fall of the leafe, which we call <hi>Autumne,</hi> and they are of longer continuance then the other. The signes are none other but such as I haue already declared<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for they are the same feuers, onely altering in the time of the yeare. If therefore your horse do chance to catch a feuer at the fall of the leafe, you shall let him bloud on his necke veine, and in the palate of his mouth, and you shall giue him to drinke the same drinke which is formerly set downe for the feuer continuall, and there is no doubt of his recouery.</p>

                     <p>A Feuer taken in the Summer season is the worst of al ordinary feuers whatsoeuer, especially all such as are taken in the Dog daies; because according to the opinion of Farriers, al accidents are then most furious: the especial signes of this feuer are, that his arteries wil beate most palpably, &amp; wheresoeuer he staleth, there you shall perceiue he sheddeth his seed also. The cure according to the ancients is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to let him bloud on the great veine which he hath on his hinder haunch, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most foure inches beneath his fundament; but for
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:26941:29"/>
mine own part, because that vein is not so easily found of euery ignorant Smith, &amp; that many times by mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, they may cut the artery in stead of the veine, I hold it fully as good to let him bloud vpon the necke veine; which done, giue him to drinke two howres and a halfe after, this drinke. Take the iuice of a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of purslaine, and mixe it with gumdragant, anise seedes, and damaske rose leaues beaten to powder; then put them into a quart of strong ale made sweete either with sugarcandy or hony, and faile not to giue him this drinke three mornings together, keeping the horse warme during his sicknesse.</p>

                     <p>A Feuer taken in the winter, is not so dangerous touching the life of a horse, as the feuer before mentioned; yet is it a feuer which will continue long, and aske great circumspection in the cure: the causes thereof are the same which are formerly described; and the signes are no other then hath bene already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared. Touching the cure it is thus: you shall first purge his head by making him neese, that done you shall let him bloud both in the necke, and the palate of the mouth, and then two howres and a halfe after, giue him this drinke. Take of treus three ounces, of round pepper halfe an ounce, of bay berries and the seede of smallage, of each halfe an ounce; boyle these in white wine, and giue it him to drinke luke warme.

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:26941:30"/>
a spoonefull, and to make him drinke it luke warme; but the horse which taketh this drinke, must be in good strength, for it he be brought low, it is somewhat too strong.</p>
                     <p>The ancient <hi>Italians</hi> did vse for this feuer, to giue this drinke: Take of <hi>Aristolochia</hi> halfe an ounce, of Gentian, of Hysop, of wormwood, of Southerwoort, of each halfe an ounce, of dry fat figges three ounces, of the seede of smallage an ounce and an halfe, of rue halfe an handfull; boyle them all with running water in a cleane vessel, vntil almost halfe be consumed; then when it beginnes to thicken, take it from the fire, straine it, and giue it the horse luke warme. Now there are not any of these drinkes but are sufficient for the cure; but the first is best. Now for his dyet, be sure to keepe him fasting long before his fits come, and let his drinke be onely warme mashes of malt and water. Now if you perceiue that his fits continue, and bring the horse to any weaknesse, you shall then to comfort and quicken the natural heate of the horse, rubbe and chafe all his body ouer, either in the Sunne, or by some softe fire with some wholsome friction, of which frictions you shall finde choyce in a particular chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hereafter following, together with their seuerall natures and vses.</p>

                     <p>The cure of this disease, according to the maner of the <hi>Italians</hi> &amp; <hi>French men,</hi> is first to separate the sound from the sicke, euen a farre distance from that aire where the sicke breatheth: then let them bloud in the necke veines, and giue euery one seuerally to drinke, two spoonefull of the powder of <hi>Diapente</hi> brewd in a pint of strong sacke; of the composition of which <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apente,</hi> and of the particular vertues thereof, you shall reade in a chapter following.

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:26941:32"/>
but for the plague or murraine (of some called the mountaine euill) amongst beasts, is this. Take a good quantity of old vrine, and mixe therewithall a good quantity of hens dung, stirre them well together till the dung be dissolued: then with a horne giue to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery horse of beast a pint thereof luke warme.

                     <p>AS a horses head is composed of many parts, so are those many parts subiect to many and sundry grieuances, as namely, the panicles or thin skins, which cleauing to the bones, do couer the whole braine, are subiect to headache, mygram, dizinesse, and ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes; the whole braine it selfe, is properly subiect to breede the frenzie, madnesse, sleeping euill, the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and forgetfulnesse. And here is to be noted, that many Farriers, and those of approued good skils, haue strongly held opinions, that horses haue very little or no braines at all: and my selfe for mine owne part, being carried away with their censures, did at last vpon good considerations <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>THe head-ache is a paine that commeth either of some inward cause, or of some cholericke humor, gathered together in the panicles of the braine, or else of some extreame heate or cold, or of some suddaine blow, or of some noysome sauour. The signes are the hanging downe of the horses head &amp; eares, drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of his vrine, dimnesse of sight, swolne and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trish eyes. The cure according to the opinion of some of our English Farriers, is to let him bloud in the eye veines, and to squirt warme water into his nosthrels, and for that day giue him no meate; the next morning fasting, giue him warm water and some grasse, at night giue him barley and fitches mixt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and so keepe him warme till he be sound; but this cure I do not fancy, the best help is first, to make him neese by fuming him, then let him bloud in the palate of the mouth, and keepe him fasting at least twelue howres after: then powre into his nosthrels

                     <p>THe madnesse of a horse by the most ancient and best approued Farriers, is diuided into foure pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions: the first is when some naughty bloud doth strike the panicle of the braine but in one part onely, it presently makes the horse dull both of minde and sight: and you shall know it by this signe, the horse will turne round like a beast that is troubled with the sturdy; the reason being, because the outside of the head is grieued onely. The second is when the poyson of such bloud doth infect the middle part of the braine: then the horse becommeth franticke, leaping against walles or any thing. The third is when that bloud filleth the veines of the stomacke, and infecteth as well the heart as the braine, then is he said to be madde. But the fourth and last is when that bloud not onely infecteth the braine and heart, but euen the panicles also, and then he is said to be starke madde, which you shall know by his biting at euery man which comes neere him, by his gnawing of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and walles about him. And lastly by tearing of his owne skin in peeces. Now for the cure, you shall cause him to be let bloud in all the lower parts of his body, to draw the bloud from his head, as namely, on the shackell veines, the spurre veines, the plat veines, and the thigh veines, and you shall let him bloud a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundantly, then giue him this drinke: Take the roote
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:26941:34"/>
of wild cowcumber, or where that cannot be gotten, take a handfull of rue and mints, and a handfull of blacke elleborus, and boyle them in strong red wine, and giue it luke warme to the horse in a horne. Some vse to giue mans dung with wine, three mornings to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and also to rubbe his body ouer with a fricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at least twice a day, and not to faile to giue him moderate exercise. Other vse to pierce the skinne of his head with a hot yron, to let out the ill humours. Others as the most certaine of all medicines, vse to geld him of both, or one stone at the least; but I like it not for mine owne part: the cure I haue euer vsed for this griefe, was either to make him swallow down hard hens dung, or else to giue him to drinke the root of <hi>Virgapastoris</hi> st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>THose horses are supposed by Farriers to be taken, or as some call it, planet strooke, which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of feeling or of mouing, not being able to stirre any member, but remaineth in the same forme as he was at his time of taking. Some hold it proceedeth from choler and fleame, when they are superaboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly mixt together, or of melancholy bloud, which being a cold dry humour, doth oppresse and sicken the hinder part of the braine. Other ancient Farriers hold, it cometh of some extreme cold, or extreme heate, or raw disgestion, striking into the empty veins suddainly; or else of extreme hunger caused by long fasting. The signes thereof are numbnesse, and want of motion before spoken of: as for the cure, it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers; for first you must note whether it come of cold, or heate; if it come of cold, you shall know it by the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:26941:35"/>
stuffing and poze in the head, which euer is ioyned with the disease: if of heate, by the hotnesse of his breath, and cleare fetching of his winde. Now if it proceed from cold, you shall giue him to drinke one ounce of <hi>Lacerpitium</hi> mixt with sallet oyle and mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kadine luke warme: if it proceede of heate, you shall giue one ounce of <hi>Lacerpitium</hi> with water and hony luke warme; but if it proceede of crudity or raw dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion, then you shall helpe him by fasting; and if it proceede of fasting, then you shall heale him by fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him often with good meate, as with wholesome bread, and dry oates; yet but a little at a time, that he may euer eate with a good stomacke.</p>
                     <p>Now for the French Farriers, as Monsieur <hi>Horace</hi> and the rest, who call this disease <hi>Surprius,</hi> they hold it cometh onely from cold causes, following hot acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents; and they vse for their cure to let him bloud on the breast veines, and then put him into a sweate, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by exercise, or multiplicity of clothes, but many clothes is better, because the horse is not capable of labour: and sometimes they will bury him all saue the head in an old dunghill, till throuh the heate thereof his limbs receiue such feeling that he begins to strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle out of the same. All which cures are not much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse; yet in mine opinion, this is the best, easiest, and surest way: First to let him bloud in the necke and breast, then to annoynt all his body with oyle <hi>Petroli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> then giue him this drinke. Take of malmsey three pints, and mixe it with a quarterne of sugar, cynamon and cloues, and let him drinke it luke warme: then take old rotten wet litter, and for want thereof, wet hay, and with clothes, sursingles and cords, swaddle al his whole body ouer with the same of a good thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:26941:35"/>
and renew it once in three daies till he be whole, let his stable be warme, his exercise moderate, and if he grow costiue, let him first be raked, and after giue him either a glister, or a suppositary, according to his strength. There is also another kinde of taking, and that is when a horse is planet strooke, or stricken with thunder; but it is vtterly vncurable, and therefore I will omit to speake further of it. The last kinde of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king is when a horse is shrow runne, that when a horse lieth sleeping, there is a certain venemous field mouse, called a shrow, whose head is extraordinary long, like a swines head, and her feete shorter of the one side then the other. This mouse if she happen to runne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer any of the limbes of the horse, presently the horse leeseth the vse of that limbe she ranne ouer; and if she runne ouer his body, he commonly leeseth the vse of his hinder loynes; and these accidents hauing bene often found vnexpected, common Farriers haue held the horse to be taken, or planet strooke. As for the cure thereof, the best is to seeke out a bryer which groweth at both ends, and take the horse or beast that is thus vexed, and draw him vnder the same, and it is a present remedy. For mine owne part, I haue heard much, both of the infirmity, and of the cure, but I haue had no experience of it, but only in one yong foale, which being suddainly lame, was as suddainly helped to my much contentment.</p>

Others with a cloue or two of garlicke. Others vse for this disease to take selladine, and stamping it, to stoppe it into his eares, and so tye vp his eares, or stitch the tippes of his eares together, that he may not shake the medicine out. Others vse to mixe salt and water together thicke, &amp; to put it into his eares. Others vse to mixe ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill and and aquauitae together, and to put that into his eares. Others vse to take garlicke, rue, and bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salt, and beate them grosly, then mixe vineger with them, and put it into the horses eares, then wet wolle or tow in the medicine, and stoppe that in his eares
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:26941:36"/>
also: let the medicine rest so foure and twenty houres, and if he forsake his meate, wash his tongue with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar, and it wil recouer his stomacke. Others vse, first to perfume the horses head to make him neese, then to take halfe a handfull of selladine, and as much hearb of grace, three or foure cloues of garlicke, and a little bay salt, and stampe them all together: then mixe therwith two or three spoonful of vinegar or verdges, and thrust it hard into the horses eares: then tye vp his eares with a soft inckle string, that no aire may come in, and let this medicine remaine the space of a day and a night: then let him bloud in the neck veine, and giue him a comfortable drench, of which dren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches you shall find great plenty, together with their vses in a chapter following. There be some Smiths which onely take rue and selladine, of each like quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, and stamping them with white salt, thrust it into the horses eare, and it helpeth. Others take an ounce and a halfe of the oyle of bitter almonds, two drams of an oxe gall, an halfe peny in blacke <hi>Ellaber</hi> stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and fiue drams of the graines of <hi>Casterum,</hi> vinegar and verdges; seeth them all together till the vinegar be consumed, then straine them, and put it into the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses eares. All these medicines haue bene diuers times approued to be singular good, and for mine owne part I haue found great effect in them; yet that which I haue found at all times most excellent, is, if the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease be young and early taken (that is, before the horse be growne into any extremity of weaknesse) to take onely verdges and bay salt, and mixing them well to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to stoppe it into the horses eares.

hauing dissolued it in vinegar, warme it vpon a chaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing dish and coales, and with round balles of towe, thrust it hard into the horses eares, and so bind them vp for foure and twenty howres, after which time giue him a comfortable drink. Now whereas some Smiths do vse to stampe aqua-vitae and garlicke together, and stoppe that into his eares, I for my part, thinke it too strong, except the horse be in great lust, and full of flesh, which if he be, doubtlesse it may do well inough.</p>

Now considering that the most of our best English stables are furnished euer with some horses of these countries, I thinke it not amisse to write something touching the disease. It proceedeth from cold and grosse fleame gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the forepart of the head, betwixt the pani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle and the braine, which being by any hot vapour disperst ouer the whole braine, it doth instantly cause this falling. There be others which suppose that it is gouerned by the Moone; and that by a certaine course thereof both horses and other beasts do fall, and as it were, dye for a small time. The signes to know the disease is, the horse will fall suddainly, both through
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:26941:37"/>
the resolution of his members, and the dissention of his sinewes; all his body will quake and quiuer, and they will foame much at their mouthes; yet when you thinke them past all hope of life, they will start vp suddenly and fall to their meate. Now if you will know whether these fits will come often or but sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, you shall feele the gristle betwixt his nosthrels, and if it be cold he will fall oft, but if it be warme he will fall seldome. The cure is, you shall first let him bloud on the necke veine, taking good store of bloud away: then within foure or fiue dayes after, you shall let him bloud on his temple veines, and on his eye veines: then annoint all his body ouer with a comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table friction, then bathe his head and eares with oyle de bay, liquid pitch and tarre mixt together, and of the same put some into his eares: then make him a cap or bgigin of canuasse quilted with wolle, to keep his head warme: then giue him a purgation or scouring, of which you shall find plenty in a chapter hereafter: you shall also force him to neese, but if the disease notwithstanding continue still, you shall then with a hot yron pierce the skin of his forehead in diuers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and after annoynt it with sweet butter, for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you shall draw out the grosse humours which do oppresse the braine; and in any wise during the time that he remaineth in phisicke, let his stable be kept ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding warme, and his dyet thin.</p>

Now for my part, I rather hold it an infirmity of the stomacke and inward bowels, which being cloyed with much glut and fat, doth in the night season so hinder the spirits and powers from doing their naturall office, that the beast hauing, as it were, his breath strangled, doth with an vnnaturall struggling in his sleepe, put his body into an extreme sweat, and with that passion is brought to much faintnesse; of which I haue had much and continuall experi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nce, onely in horses ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding fat and newly taken from the grasse, but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially from such horses as are either fatted vpon eddish grasse, which in some countries is called after-maths; or such as are taken vp fat in the winter season. The signes to know this disease is, that in the morning when you come early to your horse, you shall finde him all of a great sweate, and his body something panting; or perhaps you shall but only find him sweat in his flankes, vpon his necke, and at the rootes of his eares: either of both are signes of this sicknesse, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if at night when you litter him, you finde that he is dry of his body, and giueth no outward signe of inward sicknesse. Now there be some that will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect against me, and say: that this infirmity is not the night-mare, but an ordinary infirmity ingendred by superfluity of cold, grosse, and vnwholesome food,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:26941:38"/>
got in the winter season: which nature, through the helpe of warme clothes, and a warme house, expels in this manner, in the night season. To this obiection I answer, that if they do disallow this sicknesse to be the night-mare, that then without all contradiction, there is no such disease as the night-mare at all, and that it is but only a name without any substance or consequence; but forasmuch as this sicknesse is not onely very vsuall, but also carrieth with it all the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and attributes ascribed vnto the night-mare, and that it is as yet a disease vnnamed, I do not think I can giue it a more proper terme then to call it the night-mare. The cure whereof is, euery morning and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, both before and after his water, to giue the horse some moderate exercise, as to make him go at least a mile and more for his water; and after he is watered, to gallop him gently on the hand a good space: then when he is brought into the house, and well rubbed, to giue him his prouender, being oates, and to mixe therewith a handfull or better of hempseede; onely in this cure you must be carefull, that your exercise do not enforce him to sweate, nor shall you haue need to vse it longer then you finde that he sweateth much in the night season. This exercise and medicine will not onely cure this infirmity, but also any cold that is newly gotten whatsoeuer.</p>

                     <p>THese palseyes or apoplexies which happen vnto horses, are of two sorts: the one generall, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther particular. The generall palsey is when a horse is
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:26941:39"/>
depriued of all sense and mouing generally ouer his whole body, which is seldome or neuer found out by our Farriers; because the mortality and suddainnesse of death which pursues the disease, takes from them all notes &amp; obseruations of the infirmity: and indeed for the generall palsey there is no cure, and therefore there needs no description of signe or cure. For the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar palsey, that is, when a horse is depriued but of some part or member of his body, and most commonly it is but the necke onely, as both my selfe and others haue found by dayly experience. The disease proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from foulnesse of foode, or from fenne feeding, which breedeth grosse, cold, and tough humours, which ioyning with crudities and raw disgestions, oppresse the braine violently altogether; it also cometh many times by meanes of some blow or wound gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vpon the temples of the head. The signes to know the disease, are the gathering together of his body, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing crookedly, and not straight forward but seldome, and holding his necke awry without motion; yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer forsaking his prouender or meate, but eating it with greedinesse and much slauering. The cure is to let him bloud on his necke veine, and temple veine, on the contrary side to that way he wryeth: then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynt all his necke ouer with the oyle <hi>Petroleum,</hi> and with wet hay ropes swaddle all his necke ouer, euen from his breast to his eares, but hauing before splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his necke straight with splents of wood, made strong, smooth &amp; flat for the purpose: then for 3 mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings together, giue him a pint of old muskadine with two spoonefull of this powder to drinke. Take of <hi>Opoponax</hi> two ounces, of <hi>Storax</hi> three ounces, of <hi>Gentian</hi> three ounces, of <hi>Manna Su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:26941:39"/>
of <hi>Mirre</hi> one scruple, and of long pepper two scruples; beate all these into fine powder. Now there be some Farriers, which for this disease vse to draw the horses necke on the contrary side, with a hot yron, euen from the necke to the shoulder, and on the temple of his head, of that side also, a long strike, and on the other a little starre in this maner, <figure/>, and from his reines to his midde backe, small lines in this maner. <figure/> But I that know this sicknesse proceedeth from the braine and sinewes, cannot conceiue how any helpe should come from burning of the skinne, because it is the sinewes themselues, and not the skinne, that is drawne vp and straightned: and therefore I would wish euery Farrier to forbeare this tormenting, vnlesse he apparantly see that the skinne it selfe, through dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and weaknesse is shrunke also, and then the cure is not amisse.</p>

                     <p>THese generall crampes or conuulsions of sinewes are most forcible contractions or drawings toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the sinewes and muscles; and they happen sometimes generally into many parts of the body, somtimes particularly, as but into one member and no more: when they are generally diperst in horses, they proceede commonly from some wound, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a sinew is halfe cut and no more; and so there run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth a generall contraction ouer the whole body by degrees. When they are particular, as but in one member, then they proceede either from cold win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:26941:40"/>
causes, or from the want of bloud. For the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall contraction which cometh by a wound, you shall reade the cure thereof in the booke of Surgery follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing, where, the sinew being cut in two peeces, the contraction ceasseth. For the particular, where but one member is grieeued, you shall know it by these signes: the member will be starke and stiffe, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that neither the beast nor any man will be able to bow it: the sinewes will be hard like stickes, and the horse being downe, is not able to rise during the time of the contraction; he will also halt extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whilst the fit is vpon him, and presently go well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, as it were in one moment. The cure is, to chafe the member exceedingly, either with linseede oyle, sheeps foot oyle, or neats foot oyle; &amp; during the time of his chafing, to hold vp the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary foot that he may stand vpon the limbe which is most pained. There is also another crampe or conuulsion of sinewes, which doth extend into the necke, and reines of the horses backe, &amp; so almost vniuersally ouer the horses whole body: it proceedeth euer either from some extreme cold, as by turning a horse suddainly out of a warme stable and warme clothes into the piercing rage of the cold winter; or by the losse of much bloud, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by great windinesse entreth into the veines, and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numbeth the sinewes: or else by too much phisicking &amp; drenching of a horse, whereby the naturall heate is much weakned or dried. The signs of this conuulsion is, his head and neck wil stand awry, his eares vpright, &amp; his eyes hollow, his mouth will be clung vp that he cannot eate, and his backe will rise vp in the middest like the backe of a Cammell. The cure hereof is, with great store of warme wollen clothes, as blanckets,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:26941:40"/>
and couerlids, some foulded double about his body, and some girded all ouer from his head to his taile, to force him into a sweate; but if the clothes will not force him to sweate; then you shall either fould all his body ouer with hot wet horse litter, or else bury him all saue the head in a dunghill or mixion; then when he hath sweat an howre or two, and is moderatly coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, you shall annoynt him all ouer with this oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (holding hot barres of yron ouer him, to make the oyntment sinke into his body:) Take of hogges grease one pound, of terpentine a quarter of a pound, of pepper beaten into powder halfe a dramme, of new waxe halfe a pound, of old oyle oliue one pound, boyle all these together, and vse it, being made warm.

                     <p>THe cold or poze in a horses head is gotten by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers suddaine and vnseene meanes, according to the temper and constitution of the horses body, in so much that the best keeper whatsoeuer cannot some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times warrant his horse from that infirmity. Now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as this cold is old or new, great or small, and according to the aboundance of humours which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in the head, and as those humours are of thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse or thinnesse, so is the disease &amp; the danger there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of greater or lesser, stronger or weaker. For you shall vnderstand that if the horse haue but onely a cold that is newly taken, the signes are, he will haue many knots like waxe kyrnels betweene his chaules about the rootes of his tongue; his head will be somewhat heauy, and from his nosthrels will runne a certaine cleare water; but if about his tongue rootes be any great swelling, or inflammation like a mighty botch or bile, then it is the strangle; but if from his nosthrels do issue any thicke, stincking or corrupt matter, then it is the glanders, of both which we shall speake here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after in their proper places. Now for this ordinary cold which is ordinarily taken (the signes whereof besides his much coughing are before declared,) you shall vnderstand that for the cure being very easie, it is helped sundry wayes: some cure it onely by purging his head with pils of butter and garlicke, the manner whereof you shall finde in the chapter of purgations. Other Farriers cure it with purging his head with fumes, and forcing him to neese, the manner whereof is in the chapter of neesing; which done, you shall

                        <pb n="79" facs="tcp:26941:41"/>
because those kyrnels are called of the <hi>Italians, Glandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le,</hi> that thence we borrow this word glaunders; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding moreouer that a horse which is troubled with this disease, hath great kyrnels vnderneath his iawes, easie to be felt, paining him so that he cannot eate or swallow any thing. Others say, it is a swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vpon the iawe bones great and hard, which being inflamed doth putrifie and rot; but both these opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons I hold erronious: for although our old Farriers might (according to the custome of our nation which loueth the imitation of strangers) borow this word glanders from the <hi>Italian Glandule</hi>; yet these inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions vnder the chappes of the tongue rootes, is that disease which we call the strangle, and not the glaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; and whereas they would call the strangle the <hi>Quinzie,</hi> or <hi>Squinancie,</hi> there is no such matter, neither hath a horse any such disease, except they will call the <hi>Viues,</hi> by that name which is farre more fitter for the application.</p>
                     <p>Now for the glaunders, you shall vnderstand that it is a running impostume ingendred either by cold, or by famine, or by long thirst, or by eating corrupt and musty meate, or by being kept in vnsauery places, or is taken by standing with infected horses. It is a ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering together of moyst and corrupt humours, which runneth at the nose; or may be said to be a fluxe of rheume, which issueth sometimes at one, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at both the nosthrels: the cause being the wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the passage, so that the cold liberally entring into the braine, bindeth and crusheth it in such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that it maketh the humours there to distill; which descending to the spirituall parts, and possessing them, in the end suffocates the horse either by their aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:26941:42"/>
or killeth him by corrupting the principall parts; or else by coniealing there by little and little, ouerrunneth the naturall heate. Now that distillati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that by cold cometh from the braine and breedeth this glanders, is of three sorts. The first is a cold which maketh indigest humours to passe from the braine, which cometh by taking off the saddle suddainly when the horse is hot, or by letting him drinke before he be inwardly cooled, or before his body be dryed: this distillation commonly is slimy matter that smels not, and is easie to be cured: for it is no inward vlcer, but only abundance of humor, the substance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is grosse and white. The second is a greater cold, ingendred and coniealed, causing humors something thin and slimy, of the colour of marrow, or the white of an egge: this descendeth to the throate and lyeth there till it be discharged through the nosthrels. The third is by long continuance thicker and therfore har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be cured: if the colour thereof be yellow, like a beane, then is the glaunders most desperate, and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth also in his throate; but if it be a browne or darkish yellow, then commonly a feuer will accompany the disease. To these three distillations there is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly added a fourth, which is, when the matter which comes from his nose, is darke, thinne, and reddish, like little sparkes of bloud; but then is it not said to be the glaunders, but the mourning of the chine, which is a disease for the most part, held incurable. It is therefore most necessary for euery good Farrier, when he shall take this cure in hand, to consider well the matter which issueth from the horses nose: for if the humour be cleare and transparent, so that it may be seene through, then it is not greatly hurtfull, or of
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:26941:42"/>
much moment. If it be white, it is worse, yet with much ease cured. If it be yellow, separate him from the sound horses, for he is infectious, yet to be cured: if that yellow be mixt with bloud, it is with much difficulty helped; or if the matter be like vnto saffron, the horse is as hardly to be saued: he must also consider whether the matter stinke or haue lost the smell: the first is a signe of an vlcer, the latter of death: also whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he cougheth with straightnesse in his chest or no: for that also is a signe of an inward vlcer, and that the disease is past cure. Now for the cure of these three distillations, which are all that make vp a complete glaunders, you shall vnderstand that when the glaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders is of the first sort, it is easily helped by moderate exercise, and by warme keeping; but if it be of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond sort, you shall giue him warme mashes of malt &amp; water, and perfume his head well, and purge it by neesing: and into his mashes you shall put fennell seedes bruised. Others wil take a pint of white wine, a handfull of soote, a quart of milke and two heads of garlike bruised; brew them together, and giue it the horse to drinke. Others will take a pottell of vrine, a handfull of baysalt, and a good quantity of browne sugarcandy, boyle it to a quart: then adde licoras and anise seedes beaten to fine powder, and giue it luke warme to drinke. Others will take larde or swines grease, and boyle it in water: then take the fatte from the water, and mingle it with a little oile oliue, a good quantity of vrine, &amp; halfe as much white wine; giue a quart of this luke warme to drinke. Others vse to giue of ale a quart, of grated bread an ounce and a halfe, the yolkes of two egges, of ginger, saffron, cloues, cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namon, nutmegs, cardimonium, spicknard or lauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:26941:43"/>
galingale and hony, of each a pretty quantity; mixe these together, and giue it to drinke. Now if the distillation be of the third sort, which is the worst of the three, you shall take halfe a pound of swines bloud, and melt it at the fire, adde to it a pound of the iuice of beets, with three ounces of <hi>Euforbium</hi> finely beaten; and when it hath boyled a little, take it from the fire, and adde an another ounce of <hi>Euforbium</hi> to it: keepe this oyntment, and annoynt therewith two ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry long feathers, or little roddes, lapt with linnen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout; and so annoynted, put them into his nostrhrels, and after rubbing them vp and downe, tye them to the nose-band of the bridle, and walke him abroad: do thus three dayes together, and it will either absolutely cure him, or at least take away the eye sore. Others vse to take a quart of ale, an halfe peny worth of long pepper, a little brimstone, and a penny worth of Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingal, two peniworth of spygnal of Spaine, two peny waight of saffron brayed, with two ounces of butter boyled in the ale; when it is luke warme, cast the horse and holding vp his head, powre it equally into his nosthrels: then hold his nosthrels close till his eyes stare, and that he sweate; which done, giue him bayes and ale to drinke: then let him rise, and set him vp warme, feeding him with warme graines and salt, or with sweet mashes; but the best is, if the weather be warme, to let him runne abroad at grasse. Other Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers vse to dissolue in vinegar three drams of mustard-seede, and as much <hi>Euforbium</hi>: then to giue him one dram at his nosthrell euery day before he drinke. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers vse to take of <hi>Mirre, Iris Illyrica,</hi> seedes of smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, <hi>Aristolochia,</hi> of each three ounces, <hi>Sal-niter, Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston,</hi> of each fiue ounces, bayes, two ounces, saffron
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:26941:43"/>
one ounce; make this into powder, and when you giue it, giue part in pils, made with paste and wine, and part by the nosthrels with strong ale: do this for the space of three dayes at the least. Others vse to take of malmsey a pint, of strong ale a pint, of aqua-vitae foure spoonefull, and brew them together with a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty quantity of anise seeds, licoras, ellocampane roots, long pepper, garlicke, and three or foure new layed egges, and a little buter; giue this luke warme to drink: then walke him abroad, and set him vp warme: do thus euery other day for a weeke together. Others vse to take stale vrine that hath stood three or foure daies, and ten garlicke heades, and seething them together, giue it the horse to drinke. Others vse to take swines grease well clarified, and as much oyle de bay as a wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut, and giue it the horse to drinke with faire water luke warme. Others vse to take of ellocampane, anise seeds and licoras, of each one peny worth, boyle them in three pints of ale or beere til one pint be consumed; then adde vnto it a quarter of a pint of sallet oyle, and giue it him to drinke luke warme: then with a quill blow <hi>Euforbium</hi> vp into his nosthrels, and within three dayes after, take mustard foure spoonefull, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar a pint and an halfe, butter three ounces, boyle them together, then adde thereto halfe an ounce of pepper, and giue it the horse luke warme to drinke: vse this medicine a fortnight. Others vse to take a handfull of pild garlicke, and boyle it in a quart of milke till a pint be consumed: then adde thereto two ounces of sweet butter, and a pint of strong ale, stirre them well together, and giue it the horse fasting to drinke luke warme: which done, ride him a little vp and downe, and vse this the space of nine dayes.

Thus I haue shewed you the opinions &amp; practise of all the best Farriers both of this kingdome and of others, &amp; they be all very good &amp; effectual; yet for mine own part, that which I haue found euer the best in my pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise is, if the disease be of the first or second sort, to giue the horse to drinke fasting euery morning for a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night together, a pint of strong ale, and fiue spoone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of the oyle of oates, the making of which oyle, you shall reade in a particular chapter following; but if the disease be of the third sort, which is most des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, you shall then take of Tanners ouse a pint, and of new milke a pint, and of oyle oliue halfe a pint, and the quantity of a head of garlicke brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and a little turmericke; mixe these well toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and giue it the horse to drinke: do this thrice in one fortnight, and it will helpe if any helpe be to be had.</p>

                     <p>THis disease which we call the mourning of the chine, or as some Farriers terme it, the moist mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, is that fourth sort of corrupt distillation from the braine, of which we haue spoken in the chapter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, shewing from whence it proceedes, and the signes thereof; to wit, that the corrupt matter which issueth from his nosthrels, will be darke, thinne, and reddish, with little streakes of bloud in it. It is suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by some Farriers, that this disease is a foule con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption of the liuer, and I do not dissent from that opinion: for I haue found the liuer wasted in those horses which I haue opened vpon this disease; and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:26941:44"/>
this consumption proceedes from a cold, which after growes to a poze, then to a glaunders, and lastly to this mourning of the chine.</p>
                     <p>The cure whereof, according to the opinion of the oldest Farriers, is to take cleare water, and that hony which is called <hi>Hydromel</hi> a quart, and put thereunto three ounces of sallet oyle, and powre it into his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strels each morning the space of three dayes; &amp; if that helpe not, then giue him to drinke euery day, or once in two dayes at the least, a quart of old wine mingled with some of the soueraigne medicine called <hi>Tetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pharmacum,</hi> which is to be had almost of euery Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary. Others vse to take garlicke, houslicke &amp; cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill; and stamping them together, to thrust it vp into the horses nostrels.</p>
                     <p>Others vse to let the horse fast all night; then take a pint and a halfe of milke, three heads of garlicke pild &amp; stamped; boyle them to the halfe, and giue it to the horse, some at the mouth and some at the nose; then gallop him a quarter of a mile, then rest him; then gallop him halfe a mile, and rest him againe: thus do twice or thrice together; then set him vp warme, and giue him no water till it be high noone: then giue him a sweete mash: vse this cure at least three dayes together. Others vse to take halfe a pecke of oates, &amp; boyle them in running water till halfe be consumed; then put them into a bagge, and lay them very hot vpon the nauell place of his backe, and there let it lye thirty howres, vsing thus to do three or foure times at the least. Others vse to take wormewood, <hi>Peu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedanum,</hi> and <hi>Centorie,</hi> of each like quantity: boyle them in wine; then straine them, and powre there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of many times into his nosthrels, especially into
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:26941:45"/>
that which most runneth. Others vse to take hare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hound, licoras, &amp; anise seeds, beaten to powder: then with sweete butter to make pils thereof, and to giue them fasting to the horse Others vse to take wheate flower, anise seedes, and licoras, stamped in a mortar, fiue or sixe cloues of garlike bruised; mixe all these to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether &amp; make a paste of them; then make it into pils as big as walnuts, &amp; taking out the horses tongue, cast the balles downe the horses throate three or foure at a time, then giue him two new layed egges, shelles and all after them. Now after all these, the best and most approuedst medicine, is to take as much of the middle greene barke of an Elder tree growing on the water side, as will fill a reasonable vessell, putting thereunto as much running water as the vessell will hold, and let it boyle till halfe be consumed, and then fill vp the vessell againe with water, continuing so to do, three times one after another: and at the last time when the one halfe is consumed, take it from the fire, and straine it exceedingly through a linnen cloath; then to that decoction, adde at least a full third part of the oyle of oates, or for want of that, of oyle oliue, or of hogges grease, or sweete butter; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing warmed againe, take a quart thereof, and giue it the horse to drinke, one horne-ful at his mouth, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother at his nosthrels, especially that which casteth out the matter. And in any case let the horse be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting when he taketh this medicine: for it not onely cureth this, but any sicknesse proceeding from cold whatsoeuer: it shall be also good to vse to his body some wholesome friction, &amp; to his head some whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some bathe, of which bathes you shall reade more hereafter in a chapter following. For his dyet, his food
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:26941:45"/>
would be sodden barley and sweete hay, and his drinke warme water or mashes; but if it be in the Summer season, then it is best to let him runne at grasse onely.</p>

                     <p>COughing is a motion of the lungs, raised natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from his expulsiue power, to cast out the hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full cause, as neesing is the motion of the braine. Now of coughes, there be some outward, and some inward: those are sayd to be outward which proceed of outward causes, as when a horse doth eate or drinke too greedily, so that his meat goeth the wrong way; or when he licketh vp a feather: or eateth dusty or sharpe bearded straw, and such like, which tickling his throat, causeth him to cough: those which are sayd to be inward, are either wet or dry, of which we shall speake more hereafter. Now of these outward coughes, they may proceede from the corruption of the ayre, which if it do, you shall boyle in running water, figges and currants together; then straining the water, adde to a quart thereof, three spoonfull of <hi>Diapente,</hi> and it will helpe. It may also proceed from dust; and then you must wash it downe by powring into his nosthrels ale and oyle mingled together. It may come by eating sharpe and sowre things; and then you must put downe his throat, pils of sweete butter, whose softnesse will helpe him. It may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede from some little or sleight taken cold; and then you shall take the whites &amp; yolkes of two egges, three ounces of sallet oyle, two handfull of beane flowre,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:26941:46"/>
one ounce of Fenugreeke; mixe them with a pint of old malmsey, and giue it the horse to drinke three daies together: or else take tarre and fresh butter; mixe them together, and giue pils thereof to the horse foure times in seuen dayes, that is, the first, the third, the fift, and the seuenth day. There be others which vse to take a gallon of faire water, and make it ready to seeth: then put thereto a pecke of ground malt, with two handfuls of boxe leaues chopt small, and a little groundsel; mixe them altogether, and giue him euery morning and euening a pint for a weeke together. If to the boxe leaues you adde oates and bettony, it is not amisse, so you keep the horse warme. Others vse to giue a horse a pint of swines bloud warme. Others vse to boyle in a gallon of water, one pound of Fenugreeke; then straining it, giue the water morning and euening by a pint at a time to drinke; then drying the Fenugreeke, giue it the horse with his prouender. Others vse for all maner of coughes, to take a quarterne of white currants, and as much clarified hony, two ounces of sweet marioram, with old fresh grease, and a head of garlicke; melt that which is to be molten, and punne that which is to be beaten; mixe them together, and giue the horse bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then a pint thereof three mornings together. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers vse to giue a horse the guts of a young pullet dipt in hony and being warme; and certainly there is not any of these medicines but are most soueraigne and well approued. Now whereas some Farriers vse to thrust downe the throat of the horse, a willow wand, rolled about with a linnen cloath, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted all ouer with hony, I for my part do not like it: for it both torments the horse more then there is

occasion; and doth but onely go about to take away that which is gone in the struggling before the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine can be vsed: for it is onely for a cough which cometh by a feather or some such like matter.</p>

                     <p>TOuching all inward coughs which are gotten and ingendred by colds and rheumes of long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, being not onely dangerous, but sometimes mortall, you shall vnderstand that they are diuided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two kindes, the one wet, the other dry: the wet cough proceedeth from cold causes taken after great heats; which heat dissoluing humours, those humors being againe congealed, do presently cause obstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and stoppings of the lungs. Now the signes to know this wet cough is, the horse will euer after his coughing, cast out either water or matter out of his nosthrels, or champe and chaw with his teeth, the thicke matter which he casteth out of his throate, as you shall easily perceiue, if you heedfully note him: he will also cough often without intermission; and when he cougheth he will not much bow downe his head, nor abstaine from his meate: and when he drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, you shall see some of his water to issue out of his nosthrels. The cure is, first to keepe him exceeding warme; then for as much as it proceedeth of cold cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, you shall giue him hot drinkes and spices, as sacke, or strong ale brewd with <hi>cinamon, ginger, cloues, treacle, Long pepper,</hi> and either swines grease, sallet oyle, or sweete butter: for you shall know that all cold causes are cured with medicines that open and warme; and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:26941:47"/>
the hot with such as cleanse and coole. Some vse to take a pretty quantity of <hi>Beniamine,</hi> and the yolke of an egge; which being well mixt together, and put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an egge shell, cast all downe into the horses throat, and then moderatly ride him vp and downe for more then a quarter of an howre: and do this three or foure mornings together. Others vse to keepe him warme, and then to giue him this drinke. Take of barley one pecke, and boyle it in two or three gallons of running water, till the barley burst, together with bruised lico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras, anise seeds, and of raisins, of each a pound; then straine it, and to that liquor put of hony a pint, and a quarterne of sugarcandy, and keepe it close in a pot to serue the horse therewith foure seuerall mornings, and cast not away the barley nor the rest of the strai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, but make it hot euery day to perfume the horse withall in a close bagge; &amp; if he eate of it, it is so much the better: and after this you shall giue the horse some moderate exercise: and for his dyet let him drinke no cold water till his cough abate; and as it lessoneth, so let his water be the lesse warmed. Now for mine own part, though all these receits be exceeding good and very well approued; yet for mine owne part, in this case, thus hath bene my practise. If I found either by the heauinesse of the horses head, or by the ratling of his nosthrels, that the cough proceeded most from the stopping of his head, I would only giue him foure or fiue mornings together, three or foure good round pils of butter and garlicke, well knoden together, in the morning fasting; and then ride him moderately an howre after; but if I found that the sicknesse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in the chest or brest of the horse, then I would giue him twice in foure dayes, a pint of sacke, halfe a
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:26941:47"/>
pint of sallet oyle, and two ounces of sugarcandy wel brewd together, and made luke warme; and then ride him halfe an howre after; and set him vp warme, suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him to drinke no cold water till his cough began to abate or leaue him.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. 44. Of the dry Cough.</head>
                     <p>THis disease which we cal the dry cough, is a grosse and tough humour, cleauing hard to the hollow places of the lungs, which stoppeth the winde-pipes so that the horse can hardly draw his breath. It doth proceede by ill gouernment from the rheume, which distilling from the head, falleth downe to the breast, and there inforceth the horse to striue to cast it out. The especiall signes to know it is, by eating hot meates, as bread that is spiced, straw, dry hay, or such like, his extremity of coughing will encrease: by ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting cold and moyst meates, as grasse, forrage, graines, and such like, it will abate and be the lesse: he cough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth seldome; yet when he cougheth, he cougheth vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently, long time together, and dryly with a hollow sound from his chest: he also boweth his head downe to the ground, and forsaketh his meate whilest he cougheth; yet neuer casteth forth any thing either at his mouth or nosthrels. This cough is most dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and not being taken in time, is incurable: for it will grow to the pursicke or broken winded altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The cure according to the opinion of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entest Farriers is, that for as much as it proceedeth from hot humours, therefore you shall perfume his head with cold simples, as <hi>Camomill, Mellilot, Licoras,</hi>
                        <pb n="92" facs="tcp:26941:48"/>
dryed red <hi>Roses</hi> and <hi>Camphire</hi> boyled in water, and the fume made to passe vp into his mouth and nosthrels. Others vse to take a close earthen pot, &amp; to put therin three pints of the strongest vinegar, and foure egges shels &amp; all vnbroken, and 4. heades of garlicke, cleane pild &amp; bruised; &amp; set the pot-being very close couered in a warme dunghill, or a horse mixion, &amp; there let it stand foure and twenty howres; then take it forth and open it, and take out the egges which will be as soft as silke, and lay them by vntill you haue strained the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar and garlicke through a linnen cloath: then put to that liquor a quarterne of hony, and halfe a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne of sugarcandy, and two ounces of licoras, &amp; two ounces of anise seedes, beaten all into fine powder; and then the horse hauing fasted all the night, early in the morning, as about seuen or eyght a clocke, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the horses mouth with a drench staffe and a cord, and first cast downe his throate one of the egges, and then presently powre after it a horn-full of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayd drinke being made luke warme; then cast in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother egge and an other horn-full: and thus do till he haue swallowed vp all the egges, or three at the least; then bridle him, and couer him warmer then he was before, and set him vp in the stable, tying him to the bare racke for the space of two howres; then vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridle him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and giue him either some oates, hay, or grasse, yet in any case giue him no hay, vntill it haue bene somewhat sprinkled with water: for there is no greater enemy to a dry cough then dry hay, dry straw, or chaffe; let him haue no cold water the space of 9. daies. Now if you chance the first morning to leaue an egge vntaken, you shall not faile to giue it him and the remainder of the drinke the morning following. If
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:26941:48"/>
you find by this practise that the cough weareth not away, you shal then purge his head with pils, of which you shall reade in the chapter of purgations: after his pils receiued, you shall let him fast 3. howres, standing warme clothed &amp; littered in the stable: you shall also now and then giue him a warme mash, and once a day trot him moderatly abroad. There be other Farriers which for this dry cough take onely the hearbe called lions foot, or Ladies mantle, spurge &amp; smallage, of each like quantity; seeth them either in a quart of old wine, or a quart of running water till some part be consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and giue it the horse to drinke; if in stead of the hearbs themselues, you giue the iuice of the hearbs in wine, it is good. There be others which take a good quantity of white currants, &amp; as much hony, two oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Marioram,</hi> one ounce of peniriall, with 5. pounds of fresh grease, and nine heades of garlicke; beate that which is to be beaten, &amp; melt the rest; giue this in 4. or 5. dayes like pils dipt in hony. Others vse to take <hi>Myrre, Opoponax, Iris Illyrica,</hi> &amp; <hi>Galbanum,</hi> of each two ounces, of red <hi>Storax</hi> three ounces, of turpentine foure oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, of henbane halfe an ounce, of opium halfe an ounce; beate them to a fine powder, and giue two or three spoonfull with a pint of old wine, or a quart of ale. Others vse to take forty graines of pepper, foure or fiue rootes of radddish, foure heades of garlicke, and sixe ounces of sweet butter; stampe them all well together, and giue euery day a ball of it to the horse for a weeke together, making him fast two howres after his taking it; and surely it is a most excellent approued medicine for any old grown cold or cough. Other Farriers vse to take of oyle de bay and of sweete butter, of each halfe a pound, of garlicke
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:26941:49"/>
one pound, beate it together vnpild; and being well beaten with a pestill of wood, adde your oyle and but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vnto it: then hauing made it into balles, with a little wheat flowre, giue your horse euery morning for a weeke or more, three or foure balles as bigge as walnuts, keeping him fasting after from meate, three howres, and from drinke till it be night, prouided that still his drinke be warme, and his meate if it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible may be, grasse, or hay sprinkled with water; as for his prouender, it would be oates, and Fenugreeke sprinkled amongst it. Now if you perceiue that at a fortnights end, his cough doth nothing at all abate, you shall then for another weeke, giue him againe the same physicke and dyet; but truly for mine owne part, I haue neuer found it to faile in any horse what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer; yet I would wish all Farriers not to be too bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie with these inward medicines, except they be well assured that the cold hath bene long, and that the cough is dangerous.</p>

                     <p>COughes do many times proceede from the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and putrifaction of the lungs, gotten ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by some extreme cold, running or leaping, or by ouer-greedy drinking after great thirst; because the lungs being inclosed in a very thinne filme, they are therefore the much sooner broken; and if such breach be made, without instant cure, they beginne to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame and apostume, oppressing and sickning the whole lungs. Now the signes to know this disease
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:26941:49"/>
is, the horses flankes will beate when he cougheth; and the slower they beate, the more old and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous is the disease: he will also draw his winde short, and by little at once: he will groane much, be feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and loath to cough, and often turne his head to the place grieued: to conclude, he will neuer cough but he will bring vp something, which he will champ in his mouth after. The cure is, giue him two or three ounces of hogges grease, and two or three spoonfull of <hi>Diapente</hi> brewd in a quart of barley water, wherein currants hath bene sodden. Other Farriers vse to take a pound of licoras, and being scrapt, and flist, to steep it in a quart of water foure and twenty houres; then to straine it; then to boyle three or foure ounces of currants in it, and so giue it the horse to drinke, &amp; keep him fasting 3. or 4. howres after. There be other Farri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers which vse to take of Fenugreeke, and of linseed, of each halfe a pound, of gum dragant, of masticke, of myrre, of sugar, of fitch flowre, of each one ounce; let all these be beaten into fine powder, and then infused one whole night in a good quantity of warme water, and the next day giue him a quart of this luke warme, putting thereunto two ounces of the oyle of roses; and this you must do many dayes together: and if the disease be new, it will certainly heale; if it be neuer so old, it will assuredly ease him; but in any case let him drinke no cold water: and for his food, grasse is the most excellent. Others vse to take of malmsey a pint, of hony three spoonful, mixe them together; then take of <hi>Myrre,</hi> of <hi>Saffron,</hi> of <hi>Cassia,</hi> &amp; <hi>Cynamon,</hi> of each like quantity; beate them to a fine powder, and giue two spoonfull thereof in the wine to drinke; do this at least a fortnight together, and it is certaine it will helpe

Accidentally as by hasty running after drinking, or vpon a full stomacke, by which, humours are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to descend downe into the throate and lungs, and there stoppeth the passage of the breath. The signes of this disease are a continuall panting and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of his body without any coughing, great heate of breath at his nosthrels, and a squeesing or drawing in of his nose when he breatheth; besides, a coueting to hold out his head whilest he fetcheth his winde. The cure, according to the opinion of some of our best Farriers, is to giue him in his prouender the kyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels of grapes, for they both fat and purge; and you must giue them plentifully. The warme bloud of a sucking pigge is excellent good also. Other Farriers vse to take <hi>Venus-haire, Ireos, Ash-keyes, Licoras, Fenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeke,</hi>

Now the last and best medicine for this shortnesse of breath (for indeede in this case I do not affect much physicking) is onely to take anise seeds, licoras, and sugarcandy, all beaten into very fine powder; and take foure spoonfull thereof and brew it well with a pint of white wine, and halfe a pint of sallet oyle: and vse this euer after your horses trauell, and a day before he is trauelled.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. 48. Of the broken winded or Pursicke Horse.</head>
                     <p>THis disease of broken winded, I haue euer since I first began to know either horse or horse-leach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, very much disputed with my selfe, and for many yeares did constantly hold (as still I do) that in truth there is no such disease; only this I found by dayly experience, that by ouer hasty or sudden run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a fat horse (or other) presently after his water, or by long standing in the stable with no exercise and foule foode, that thereby grosse and thicke humours may be drawne downe into the horses body so abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, that cleauing hard to the hollow places of the lungs, and stopping vp the wind-pipes, the wind may be so kept in, that it may onely haue his resort back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:26941:52"/>
and not vpward, filling the guts, and taking from the body great part of its strength and liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood; which if from the corruption of our old inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we call broken winded, then I must needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that I haue seene many broken winded horses. The signes of which disease are these, much and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent beating of his flankes, especially drawing vp of his belly vpward; great opening and rising of his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sthrels, and a continuall swift going to and fro of his tuell; besides, it is euer accompanied with a dry and hollow cough. The cure, I must needes say in so great an extremity (for it is the worst of all the euils of the lungs which are before spoken of) is most desperate; but the preseruations and helpes, both to continue the horses health and his dayly seruice, are very many, as namely (according to the opinion of the ancient Farriers) to purge your horse by giuing him this drinke. Take maiden haire, of <hi>Ireos,</hi> of <hi>Ashe,</hi> of <hi>Licoras,</hi> of <hi>Fenugreeke,</hi> of <hi>Basnis,</hi> of each halfe an ounce, of <hi>Cardanum,</hi> of pepper, of bitter almonds, of <hi>Baurach,</hi> of each two ounces, of nettle seed, and of <hi>Aristolochia,</hi> of each two ounces; boile them altogether in a sufficient quantity of water; and in that decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on dissolue halfe an ounce of <hi>Agaricke,</hi> &amp; 2. ounces of <hi>Coloquintida,</hi> together with 2. pound of hony, &amp; giue him a pint &amp; a halfe of this at a time for, at least, a week together; and if the medicine chance at any time to proue too thicke, you shall make it thin with water, wherein licoras hath bene sodden; and some Farriers also besides this medicine, will with a hot yron draw the flanks of the horse to restraine their beating, and slit the horses nosthrels to giue the wind more liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but I do not affect either the one or the other: the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:26941:52"/>
best diet for a horse in this case, is grasse in Summer, &amp; hay sprinkled with water in Winter. There be other Farriers which for this infirmity hold, that to giue the horse 3. or 4. daies together sodden wheat, and now &amp; then a quart of new sweet wine, or other good wine, mixt with licoras water, is a certaine remedy. There be other Farriers which for this disease take the guts of a hedgehogge, and hang them in a warme ouen till they be dry, so that a may may make powder of them: then giue your horse 2. or 3. spoonfull thereof with a pint of wine or strong ale: then the rest mixe with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nise seeds, licoras, &amp; sweet butter, &amp; make round balles or pils thereof, &amp; giue the horse 2. or 3. after his drink; and so let him fast at least 2 howres after. Now when at any time you giue him any prouender, be sure to wash it in ale or beere; then take <hi>Comin, Anise seeds, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coras and Sentuarie</hi> of each like quantity; make them (being mixed together) into fine powder, &amp; strew two spoonful therof vpon the prouender being being wet. This physicke must be vsed for a fortnight at the least. Others vse to take of cloues &amp; nutmegs 3. drams of <hi>ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingale</hi> &amp; <hi>Cardomonum,</hi> 3. drams, of foot, of bay seeds, &amp; comin, of each 3. drams, &amp; make them into fine pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, &amp; put it into white wine, being tempered with a little saffron: then put to so many yolkes of egges as may cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teruaile the other quantity: then mixe them with water, wherin licoras hath bene sodden, making it so thin that the horse may drink it, and after he hath drunk the quantity of a pint &amp; halfe of this drinke, tye vp his head to the racke, &amp; let him so stand at least an howre after, that the drinke may descend into his guts: then walke him gently abroad, that the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine may worke, and in any case giue him no water
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:26941:53"/>
for foure and twenty houres after: the next morning giue him some grasse to eate, and the branches of willow or sallow, which will coole the heate of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now there bee other Farriers which take of <hi>Paunces, Longwort, Mayden-haire,</hi> the crops of nettles, <hi>Carduus benedictus,</hi> hearbe <hi>Fluettin,</hi> the rootes of dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons bruised, the roots of <hi>Elecampana</hi> bruised, of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hempe, of peniriall, of light wort, of <hi>Angelica,</hi> of each of these a good handfull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or so many of these as you can conueniently get; bruise them, and lay them all night in two or three gallons of water, and giue it a boyle in the morning, and let the horse drinke there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of as much luke warme as hee will; then after this drink, giue him a pretty quantity of sodden wheat: vse this dyet for a weeke or more at the least: and then if the season be fit, put him to grasse. This cure is of great reputation, and thought to helpe when all other fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth: for mine owne part I wish euery man to iudge it by the practise.</p>
                     <p>There be others which onely for nine or ten dayes together, will giue their horse water, wherein licoras hath bene sodden, mixt with wine, and hold it a most soueraigne helpe. There be others which will onely giue new milke from the cow; but I despaire in that cure, because milke being onely flegmatike, flegme is the onely substance of this disease. Other Farriers vse to keep the horse fasting foure &amp; twenty howres, then take a quart of ale, a quarter of an ounce of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nugreeke, halfe a quarter of bayes, of the greene barke of Elder trees, of sugarcandy, of water cresses<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of redde mints, of redde fennell, of haw-tree leaues, and of prim-rose leaues, of each halfe an ounce, the whites of sixe egges; beate these in a mortar and seeth them
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:26941:53"/>
in the ale, giue it him to drinke: then let him fast af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter twelue howres: then giue him meate and prouen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der inough, yet but little drinke. Others vse to giue him wet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ay and moderate trauell: then take twenty egges, and steepe them in vinegar foure and twenty howres, giuing the horse two euery morning, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the egges are spent, a pottell of new milke from the cow. Now there be other Farriers which one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will dissolue in vinegar fifteene egges, and giue the horse the first day three, the second day fiue, and the third seuen, and hold it a good helpe. Others will take an ounce of frankinsence, two ounces of brimstone, &amp; mixe it with a pint of wine, and halfe a pint of hony. Others will take <hi>Sal-niter,</hi> burnt with the powder of pitch, and giue it with the same quantity of wine and hony. Others will onely giue <hi>Sal-niter</hi> mingled with his meate, prouided alwayes, that in euery cure you keepe your horse from cold and labour; and dayly chafe his head with oyle and wine.</p>

                     <p>THis disease of the dry malady, or as the ancient Farriers terme it, a generall consumption, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a meere exulceration of the lungs, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from a cankerous, fretting and gnawing humour ingendred by cold and surfaite, which descending from the head, sickneth &amp; corrodeth the lungs. Some of our ignorant Farriers will call it the mourning of the chine; but they are thus farre forth deceiued: that the mourning of the chine doth euer cast some filthy matter at the nose, and the dry malady neuer casteth
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:26941:54"/>
forth any thing. The signes to know this dry malady or consumption are these: his flesh and strong estate of body will consume and waste away, his belly will be gaunt, his backe bone hidde, and his skin so stret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched or shrunke vp, that if you strike on him with your hand, it will sound hollow like a tabor; his haire will hardly shed; and either he will vtterly forsake his meate, or the meate he eateth will not disgest, pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or breede any flesh on his backe; he will offer to cough but cannot, except in a weake maner, as though he had eaten small bones; &amp; truly according to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of others, so I find by practise, that it is incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; yet that a horse may be long preserued to do much seruice, I haue found it by these helpes. First, to purge his head with such fumes and pils as are good for the glaunders, which you may finde in the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of purgations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then to giue him cole-worts small chopt, with his prouender, &amp; now &amp; then the bloud of a sucking pigge warme.

                     <p>THis disease which we cal the Consumption of the flesh, is an vnnaturall or generall dislike or falling away of the whole body, or, as we terme it, the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting of the flesh; which proceedeth from diuers grounds, as namely, from inward surfaits, either by naughty foode, or ill dyet, or from vncleane, moist and stinking lodging; but especially from disorderly labour, as by taking great and sudden colds after vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent heate, or such like; all which procure the wasting or falling away of the flesh. The signes whereof are these: first, an vnnaturall and causlesse leannesse, a dry and hard skinne cleauing fast to his sides, want of sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, or appetite to his meate, a falling away of his fillets, and a generall consumption both of his but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tockes and shoulders. The cure whereof, according to the ancients, is to take a sheeps head vnfleayed, and boyle it in a gallon and a halfe of ale, or running water, vntill the flesh be consumed from the bones; then straine it through a cloath, and put thereto of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar halfe a pound, of cinamon one ounce, of conserue of roses, or barberies, &amp; of cherries, of each one ounce; mingle them together, and giue the horse euery morning a quart thereof luke warme, till two sheeps heades bee spent; and after euery time he drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, let him be gently walked or ridden vp and downe according to his strength, that is, if the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be warme, abroad; if it be cold and windy, then in the stable or some close house, suffring him neither to eate nor drinke, for two howres after his medicine;

and from cold water you shall keepe him the space of fifteene dayes. Now for his ordinary foode or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uender, you shall repute that best which he eateth best whatsoever it be; and that you shall giue by little and little, and not any grosse, or great quantity at once, because the abundance and glut of food taketh away both the appetite and nutriment which should proceede from wholesome feeding.</p>

                     <p>BEsides this generall consumption of a horses flesh, which for the most part, or altogether proceedeth from sicknesse, there is also another consumption or want of flesh which proceedeth from neshnesse, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse, freenesse of spirit, and the clymate vnder which the horse is bred; as namely when a horse that is bred in a warme clymate, comes to liue in a cold, or when a horse that is bred vpon a fruitfull &amp; rich soile, comes to liue in a barren and dry place. In any of these cases the horse will be leane without any appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant signe of griefe or disease, which to recouer there be many receits and medicines, as namely: the ancient Farriers did vse when a horse either grew leane without sicknesse or wound, or any knowne di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemperature, to take a quarter of a pecke of beanes, and boyle them in two gallons of water till they swell or burst, then to mixe with them a pecke of wheate branne, and so to giue it the horse in maner of a mash: or in stead of prouender: for it will fat suddenly. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and especially the <hi>Italians,</hi> will take cole-worts, and hauing sodden them, mixe them with wheat bran
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:26941:55"/>
and salt, and giue them in stead of prouender. There be others which take the fatty decoction of three Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toyse being well sodden, (their heades, tayles, bones, and feete, being reiected) and giuing it the horse, suppose it fatteth suddenly: or if you mixe the flesh of the Tortoyse so sodden with your horses prouen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that is good also; But as the simples are <hi>Italian,</hi> and not English, so for mine owne part, I referre the vse rather to them then to my country men. There be others which vse to fat vp their horses by giuing them a certaine graine which we call bucke, in the same manner as we giue oates or pease. There be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which to fat a horse, will giue him onely par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched wheat, and a little wine mixed with his water, and amongst his ordinary prouender alwayes some wheate branne; and be exceeding carefull that the horse be cleane drest, well rubbed, &amp; soft littered: for without such cleanly keeping there is no meate will enioy or do good vpon him; and also when he is fed, it must be by little at once and not surfaited. There be other Farriers which to feede vp a leane horse, will take <hi>Sage, Sauin, Bay-berries, Earth-nuts, Beares grease</hi> to drinke with a quart of wine. Others will giue the entrailes of a Barbel or a Tench with white wine. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will giue new hot draffe, and new branne, and twenty hard roasted egges, the shels being pulled off, then bruise them, and then put thereto a pretty quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of salt; then mixe all together, and giue a good quantity thereof to the horse at morne, noone, and euening for his prouender; and once a day, (which would be at high noone) giue him a quart or three pints of strong ale; and when the horse beginneth to be glutted vpon this meat, then giue him dryed oates:
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:26941:56"/>
if he be glutted vpon that, then giue him bread, if he leaue his bread, giue him malt or any graine that he will eate with a good appetite, obseruing euer to keepe the horse very warme; and with this dyet in foureteene dayes, the leanest horse will be made ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding fat. There be other Farriers which to make a horse fat, wil take a quart of wine, and halfe an ounce of brimstone finely beaten with a raw egge, and a peny waight of the powder of <hi>Myrre</hi>; mixe all together and giue it the horse to drinke many mornings toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Others will take three-leaued grasse, halfe greene and halfe dry, and giue it to the horse in stead of hay, by little at once; and it will fat suddenly, onely it will breed much ranke bloud. Other Farriers vse to take two peny worth of pepper, and as much saffron, anise seeds, and turmericke, a peny worth of long pepper, two peny worth of treacle, a peny worth of licoras, a good quantity of peniryall and archangell; giue the horse these with the yolks of egges in milke to drinke. Others take wheat made cleane, and sod with salt and lard dryed in the sunne, &amp; giue it twice a day before each watering. Others giue a pint of good wine with a raw egge beaten, &amp; a quantity of brimstone &amp; <hi>Mirre</hi> beaten to powder. Others strong ale, <hi>Myrre,</hi>

Others take sodden beanes well bruised and sprinkled with salt, adding to the water foure times so much beane flowre or wheat bran, and giue that to the horse, and it will fat him suddenly. Wine mixt with the bloud of a sucking pigge, made luke warme, or wine with the iuyce of featherfeaw,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:26941:56"/>
or an ounce of sulphur, and a peny waight of <hi>Myrre,</hi> well made into powder, together with a new layed egge, will raise vp a horse that languisheth.

                        </gap>ting a horse (for most of the wayes before prescribed, are not to breede fat that will continue) is first to giue your horse three mornings together, a pint of sweete wine, and two spoonefull of <hi>Diapente</hi> brewed together: for that drinke will take away all infection and sicknesse from the inward parts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then to feed him well with prouen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at least foure times a day, that is, after his wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the morning, after his water at noone, after his water in the euening, and after his water at nine of the clocke at night. Now you shall not let his prouender be all of one sort, but euery meale, if it may be, change, as thus: if in the morning you giue him oates, at noone you shall giue him bread, at euening beanes or pease mixt with wheat branne, and at night sodden barley, and so forth; and euer obserue of what food he eateth best, of that let him haue the greatest plenty, and there is no question but he will in very short space grow fat, sound, and full of spirit without either mislike or sicknesse.</p>

and it proceedeth from the superfluity of bloud, and other grosse humors, which being dissolued by some extreme and disorderly heate, resorteth downeward to the breast, and paineth the horse extremely that he can hardly go. The signes are a stiffe, staggering and weake going with his forelegges; and he can very hardly, or not at al, bow down his head to the ground, either to eate or to drink, and will groane much when he doth either the one or the other. The cure is first to bathe all his breast and foreboothes with the oyle of <hi>Peter</hi>; and if that do not help him, within three or foure dayes, then to let him bloud on both his breast veines in the ordinary place, and then put in a rowell either of haire, corke, horne, or leather, of all which, and the maner of rowelling, you shall reade in a more particular chapter hereafter in the booke of Surgery. Now there be other Farriers which for this sicknesse will first giue the horse an inward drench, as namely, a pint of sweet wine, and two spoonfull of diapente: then bathe all his breast and legges with wine and oyle mingled together, and in some tenne or twelue dayes it will take away the griefe.</p>

or no labor, as for the most part, your geldings of price haue, which running all the Summer at grasse, do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but gather their own food, and such like, where the maisters too much loue and tendernesse, is the meanes to bring the horse to his death, as we find day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in our practise: for when such naughty and corrupt bloud is gathered, it resorteth to the inward parts, and so suffocateth the heart. The signes whereof are, the horse will many times haue a small swelling rise at the bottome of the breast, which swelling will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease and rise vpward, euen to the top of the necke of the horse, and then most assuredly it kils the horse; he will also hang his head either downe to the manger, or downe to the ground, forsaking his food, and groa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with much painfulnnesse. This disease is of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ignorant Smiths, taken somtimes for the yellowes, and sometimes for the staggers; but you shall know that it is not so by these obseruations.

The cure thereof is two-fold: the first a preuention or preseruatiue before the disease come: the second a remedy after the disease is apparant.

two or three moneths after, when you see he is fedde; and at each time of letting bloud, you must make your quantity according to the goodnesse of the bloud: for if the bloud be blacke and thicke, which is a signe of inflammation and corruption, you shal take the more; if it be pure, red, and thin, which is a signe of strength and healthfulnesse, you shall take little, or none at all There be others which vse for this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention, to giue the horse a scouring or purgation of malmsey, oyle, and sugarcandy, the making and vse whereof you shal reade in the chapter of purgation; &amp; this would be giuen immediatly when you put your horse to feede, and as soone as you see his skin full swolne with fatnesse.</p>

                     <p>SInce wee are thus farre proceeded into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and vitall parts of a horses body, it is not amisse to speake something of the tiring of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and of the remedies for the same; because when a horse is truly tyred (as by ouer extreme la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour) it is questionlesse that all his vitall parts are made sicke and feebled. For to tell you in more plainesse what trying is, it is when a horse by extreme &amp; vncessant labour, hath all his inward and vitall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers which should accompany &amp; reioyce the heart, expelled and driuen outward to the outward parts, &amp; lesse deseruing members, leauing the heart forlorne and sicke, insomuch that a generall and cold faintnesse

Now for the tiring of horses, though in truth it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from no other cause but this before spoken; yet in as much as in our common and vulgar speech, we say euery horse that giueth ouer his labour is ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, you shall vnderstand that such giuing ouer may proceede from foure causes: the first from inward sicknesse, the second from some wound receiued, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of body or limbe; the third from dulnesse of spirit, cowardlinesse or restinesse; and the fourth from most extreme labour and trauell, which is true tired<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. indeede. Now for the first, which is inward sicknesse, you shall looke into the generall signes of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery disease, and if you finde any of those signes to be apparant, you shall straight conclude vpon that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, &amp; taking away the cause thereof, haue no doubt but the effects of his tiring will vanish with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For the second, which is by some wound receiued, as by cutting or dismembring the sinewes, ligaments, or muscles, or by straining or stooming any bone or ioynt, or by pricking in shooing, or striking nayle, y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, stub, or thorne into the sole of the horses foote, and such like. Sith the first is apparant to the eye, by disioyning the skinne, the other by halting, you shall take a suruey of your horse, and finding any of them apparant, looke what the griefe is, repaire to the latter part of this booke, which intreateth of surgery; and finding it there, vse the meanes prescribed, and the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring will easily be cured. Now for the third, which
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:26941:60"/>
is dulnesse of spirit, cowardlinesse or restinesse, you shall finde them by these signes: if he haue no appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant signe either of inward sicknes or outward griefe, neither sweateth much, nor sheweth any great altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of countenance; yet notwithstanding tireth and refuseth reasonable labour, then such tyring procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from dulnesse of spirite; but if after indifferent long trauell the horse tire, and then the man descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from his backe, the horse runne or trot away, as though he were not tired; the man then mounting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, the horse vtterly refuse to go forward, such ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring proceedeth from cowardlinesse; but if a horse within one, two, or three miles riding, being tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately vsed, and being neither put to any tryall of his strength, nor, as it were, scarcely warmed, if he in his best strength refuse labour, and tire, it proceedeth onely from restinesse and ill conditions. Then for the cure of any of all these, proceding from dulnesse, fearefulnesse, and vnwillingnesse, you shall take ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary window glasse, and beate it into fine powder: then take vp the skinne of each side the spurre veine betweene your finger and your thumbe, and with a fine naule or bodkin, make diuers small holes through the skinne, then rubbe glasse powder very hard into those holes; which done, mount his backe, and do but offer to touch his sides with your heeles, and be sure if he haue life in him, he will go forward, the greatest feare being that he will still but go too fast: but after your iourney is ended, and your allighted, you must not faile (because this powder of glasse will corrode and rot his sides) to annoynt both the sore places with the powder of Iet and turpentine mixt together: for that will draw out the venom, and heale

his sides againe. There be others which vse when a horse tireth thus through dull cowardlinesse or resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, to thrust a burning brand or yron into his but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tockes, or to bring bottels of blazing straw about his eares; there is neither of the cures but is exceeding good.</p>

                     <p>Now if it be so that your horse tire in such a place as the necessity of your occasions are to be preferred
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:26941:61"/>
before the value of your horse, and that you must seeke vnnaturall meanes to controlle nature. In this case you shall take (where the powder of glasse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore spoken of cannot be had) three or foure round pibble stones, and put them into one of his eares; and then knit the eare that the stones fall not out, and the noyse of those stones will make the horse go after he is vtterly tyred; but if that faile, you shal with a knife make a hole in the flappe of the horses eare, and thrust a long rough sticke full of nickes through the same; and euer as the horse slackes his pace, so saw and fret the sticke vp and downe in the hole, and be sure whilest he hath any li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>THis disease of the loathing of meate, is taken two wayes, the one a forsaking of meate, as when a horses mouth either through the inflammation of his stomacke, doth break out into blisters, or such like ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous sores: or when he hath the lampas, gigges, woolfes teeth, and such like. The cure of all which you shall readily find in the second part of this booke which treateth of surgery: the other a dislike of his meate through the intemperature of his stomacke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either too hot, as proceeding either from rank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of bloud, or extremity of trauell; as you may perceiue by dayly experience, when a horse is set vp in the stable very hot, and meate instantly giuen him, it is all thing to nothing but he wil loath and refuse it. Hence it comes, that I did euer hate the noone-tide bayting of horses, because mens iourneys commonly crauing haste, the horse cannot take such an naturall cooling as he ought before his meate, and thereby breeds much sicknesse &amp; disease: for meate giuen pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently after trauell when a horse is hot, is the mother of all infirmity: or else it proceedeth from the intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of the stomacke being too cold, as being caused by some naturall defect. Now if it proceede from heate onely, which you shall know either by his sudden loathing of his meate, or the extreme heate of his mouth and breath: then to coole his stomacke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, you shall either wash his tongue with vinegar, or giue him to drinke cold water mingled with oyle
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:26941:62"/>
and vinegar. There be other Farriers which vse to giue this drinke: take of milke and wine, of each one pint, &amp; put therunto of <hi>Mel Rosatum</hi> 3. ounces, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing washed his mouth with vinegar &amp; salt, giue him the drink luke warme with a horne. But if the loathing of his meate proceede from the coldnesse of his sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, which onely is knowne by the standing vp and staring of his haire: then by the opinion of the ancient Farriers, you shall giue him wine &amp; oyle mixt together diuers mornings to drinke; but others of our late Farriers giue wine, oyle, rue, and sage boyled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by a quart at a time to drinke. Others to the former compounds will adde white pepper &amp; <hi>Myrre.</hi> Others vse to giue the horse onions pild and chopt, and <hi>Rocket</hi> seede bruised and boyled in wine. Others vse to mixe wine with the bloud of a sow pigge. Now to conclude, for the generall forsaking or loathing of meate, proceeding either from hot or cold causes in the stomacke, there is nothing better then the greene blades of corne (especially wheate) being giuen in a good quantity, and that the time of the yeare serue for the gathering thereof. Others in stead thereof, will giue the horse sweet wine and the seedes of <hi>Gith</hi> mixt together, or else sweet wine and garlike well pild and stampt, being a long time brewd together.</p>

                     <p>THe ancient Farriers, especially the <hi>Italians,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly do affirme, that a horse may haue such a paulsey, proceeding from the coldnesse of his sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, and may make him vnable to retaine and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:26941:63"/>
keepe his drinke, but that many times he will vomit and cast it vp againe: for mine owne part, from those causes I haue not seene such effects, yet from other causes, as from cold in the head, where the rheume binding about the roots and kirnels of the tongue, hath, as it were, strangled and made straight the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages to the stomacke; there I haue many times seene a horse cast his water that he drunke, in very abundant sort backe againe through his nosthrels, &amp; sometimes striue with great earnestnesse to drinke, but could not at all. The signes of both (from which cause foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it proceede) is onely the casting vp of his drinke or water; and the cure thereof is onely to giue him cordiall and warme drinkes, as is malmsey, cinamon, anise seedes, and cloues, well brewd and mixt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to annoynt his breast and vnder his shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, with either the oyle of Cypresse, oyle of Spike, or the oyle of pepper; and to purge his head with fumes or pilles, such as will force him to neese, of which you may see store in a chapter following: for such fumigation ioyning with these hot oyles, will soone dissolue the tumors.</p>

                     <p>THere is not any disease more easily procured, nor more dangerous to the life of a horse, then this surfaite which is taken by the glut of prouender; it cometh most commonly by keeping the horse ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme sharpe or hungry, as either by long trauell or long standing empty; &amp; then in his height of greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, giuing him such superabundance of meate, that
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:26941:63"/>
his stomacke wanting strength to disgest it, all the whole body is driuen into an infinite great paine and extremity. The signes are great weaknesse and feeblenesse in the horses limbes, so that he can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly stand, but lyeth downe oft, and being downe, walloweth and tumbleth vp and downe as if he had the bots.</p>
                     <p>The cure thereof according to the ordinary pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of our common Farriers, is to take a halfe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny worth of blacke sope, and a quart of new milke, and as much sweete butter as sope; and hauing on a chafing dish and coales, mixt them together, giue it the horse to drinke: this will cleanse the horses stomacke, and bring it to its strength a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>
                     <p>But the ancient Farriers did vse first, to let the horse bloud in the necke veine, (because euery sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fait breedes distemperature in the bloud) then trot the horse vp and downe an howre or more; and if he cannot stale draw out his yard and wash it with white wine made luke warme, and thrust into his yard either a cloue of garlicke or a little oyle of camomill, with a peece of small waxe candle. If he cannot dung, first with your hand rake his fundament, and then giue him a glister, of which you shall read hereafter: when his glister is receiued you shall walke him vp and downe till hee haue emptyed his belly, then set him vp and keepe him hungry the space of two or three dayes, obseruing euer to sprinkle the hay hee eateth with a little water, and let his drinke be warme water and branne made mash-wise; after he hath drunke the drinke let him eate the branne if he please, but from other prouender keep him fasting
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:26941:64"/>
at least tenne dayes. There be other Farriers that in this case, vse onely to take a quart of beere or ale, and two peny worth of sallet oyle, and as much dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon water, a peny worth of treacle; make all these warme vpon the coales, then put in an ounce of cina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, anise seedes, and cloues, all beaten together, and so giue it the horse luke warme to drinke. All these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts are exceeding good; yet for mine owne part, and many of the best Farriers confirme the same, there is nothing better for this disease, then moderate exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise, much fasting, and once in foure or fiue dayes a pint of sweete wine, with two spoonefull of the powder Diapente.</p>

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>sted, breedeth euill and grosse humours, which by little &amp; little spreading themselues through the members, do at the length oppresse, &amp; almost confound the whole body, absolutely taking away from him al his strength, insomuch that he can neither go nor bow his ioynts, nor being layd, is able to rise againe: besides, it taketh
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:26941:64"/>
away from him his instrumentall powers, as the office both of vrine and excrements, which cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed but with extreme paine. There be other Farriers, and to their opinion I rather leane, that sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it proceedeth from suffering the horse to drinke too much in his trauell being very hot, whereby the grease being suddenly cooled, it doth clappe about, and suffocate the inward parts with such a loathsome fulnesse, that without speedy euacuation, there can be no hope but of death onely. Now whereas some Farriers do hold that this foundring in the body, should be no other then the foundring in the legges, because it is (say they) a melting and dissolution of humours which resort downeward, they are much deceiued: for it is not as they hold a dissolution of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, but rather a binding together of corporall and substantiall euils, which by an vnnaturall accident doth torment the heart. Now for the hold which they take of the name Foundring, as if it were drawne from the French word <hi>Fundu,</hi> signifying melting, truly I thinke it was rather the ignorance of our old Farriers, which knew not how to entitle the disease, then any coherence it hath with the name it bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. For mine owne part, I am of opinion that this disease which we cal foundring in the body, doth not onely proceede from the causes aforesayd, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so and most oftest by sudden washing horses in the winter season, when they are extreme fat and hot with instant trauell, where the cold vapour of the water striking into the body, doth not onely astonish the inward and vitall parts, but also freezeth vp the skin, and maketh the bloud to leese his office. Now the signes to know this disease, are holding downe of
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:26941:65"/>
his head, staring vp of his haire, coughing, staggering behinde, trembling after water, dislike of his meate, leannesse, stiffe going, disability to rise when he is downe: and to conclude, which is the chiefest signe of all other, his belly will be clung vp to his backe, and his backe rising vp like a Camell. The cure accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the opinion of the Farriers, is first to rake his fundament, and then to giue him a glister: which done, and that the horses belly is emptyed, then take of malmsey a quart, of sugar halfe a quarterne, of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namon halfe an ounce, of licoras and anise seedes, of each two spoonefull beaten into fine powder; which being put into the malmsey, warme them together at the fire so that the hony may be molten, then giue it the horse luke warme to drinke: which done, walke him vp and downe either in the warme stable or some warme roade the space of an howre; then let him stand on the bit fasting two howres more, onely let him be warme clothed, stopt, and littered; &amp; when you giue him hay, let it be sprinkled with water, and let his prouender be very cleane sifted from dust, and giuen by a little at once; and let his drinke be warme mashes of malt and water. Now when you see him recouer and get a little strength, you shall then let him bloud in the necke veine, and once a day perfume him with Frankinsence to make him neese, and vse to giue him exercise abroad when the wether is warme, and in the house when the weather is stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
                     <p>Now there be other Farriers which vse for this disease to take a halfe peny worth of garlicke, two peny worth of the powder of pepper, two peny worth of the powder of ginger, two peny worth of

                        </gap> eagerly, whereas indeeede this ouer-hasty and greedy ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, is more rather an infirmity and sicknesse of the inward parts; and this disease is none other then an insatiate and greedy eating, contrary to nature and old custome; and for the most part, it followeth some extreme great emptinesse or want of foode, the beast being euen at the pinch, and ready to bee chappe-falne. There bee some Farriers which suppose that it proceedeth from some extreame cold, outwardly taken by trauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in cold and barraine places, as in the frost and snow, where the outward cold maketh the stomacke cold, whereby all the inward powers are weakned. The signes are onely an alteration or change in the horses feeding, hauing lost all temperance; and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:26941:66"/>
snatching and chopping at his meate as if he would deuoure the manger. The cure, according to the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of some Farriers, is first to comfort his stomacke by giuing him great slices of white bread toasted at the fire and steeped in muskadine, or else bread vntoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted &amp; steeped in wine, &amp; then to let him drink wheat flowre and wine brewed together. There be others which vse to knead stiffe cakes of wheate flowre and wine, and to feede the horse therewith. Others vse to make him bread of pine-tree nuts and wine kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den together: or else common earth and wine min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled together; but for mine owne part, I hold no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better then moderately feeding the horse many times in the day with wholesome beane bread, well baked, or oates well dryed and sifted.</p>

                     <p>THere is no question but the liuer of a horse is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to as many diseases as either the liuer of a man or any other creature, onely through the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of our common Farriers (who make all inward diseases one sicknesse) the true ground, and causes not being looked into, the infirmity is let passe, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times poysoned with false potions; but truth it is, that the liuer sometimes by the intemperatenesse thereof, as being either too hot or too cold, too moist, or too dry, or sometimes by meanes of euill humors, as choler or fleame ouerflowing in the same, heate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendring choler, and coldnesse fleame, the liuer is subiect to many sicknesses, and is diuersly payned, as
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:26941:66"/>
by inflammation, apostumation or vlcer, or by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, stoppings, or hard knobs; or lastly, by the consumption of the whole substance thereof The signes to know if the disease proceede from hot cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, is leannesse of body, the loathing of meate, voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding dung of a strong sent, great thirst, and loosnesse of belly. The signes to know if the disease proceed from cold causes, is good state of body, appetite to meate, dung not stincking, no thirst, and the belly neither loose nor costiue. Now to proceede to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar diseases of the liuer, and first of the inflammation, you shall vnderstand that it cometh by meanes that the bloud through the abundance, thinnesse, boyling heate of sharpnesse thereof, or through the violence of some outward cause, breaketh out of the veines &amp; floweth into the body or substance of the liuer; and so being dispossest of his proper vessels, doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately putrifie &amp; is inflamed, corrupting so much of the fleshly substance of the liuer, as is either tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched or imbrewed with the same; whence it cometh, that for the most part, the hollow side of the liuer is first consumed, yet sometimes the full side also: this inflammation by a naturall heate, is sometimes tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to putrifaction, &amp; then it is called an apostumati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which when either by the strength of nature or art, it doth breake and runne, then it is called an vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer or filthy sore. Now the signes of an inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on the hollow side of the liuer (which is least hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full) is loathing of meate, great thirst, loosnesse of bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and a continuall vnwillingnesse to lye on the left side; but if the inflammation be on the full side of the liuer, then the signes be short breathing, a dry cough, much paine when you handle the horse about the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:26941:67"/>
wind-pipe, and an vnwillingnesse to lye on the right side. The signes of apostumation is great heate, long fetching of breath, and a continuall looking to his side. The signes of vlceration, is continuall coldnesse, staring vp of the haire, and much feeblenesse &amp; faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, because the filthy matter casting euill vapours abroad, doth many times corrupt the heart, and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion death. Now for the cure of these inflammations, some Farriers vse to take a quart of ale, an ounce of myrre, and an ounce of Frankinsence, and brewing them well together, giue it the horse diuers mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings to drinke. Others vse to take three ounces of the seedes of smallage, and three ounces of Hysop, and as much Sutherwort, and boyle them wel in oyle and wine mingled together, and giue it the horse to drinke; keepe the horse warme, and let him neither drinke cold water, nor eate dry dusty hay.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. 61. Of Obstructions, stoppings, or hard knobs on the Liuer.</head>
                     <p>THese obstructions, or stoppings of a horses liuer, do come most commonly by trauelling or labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring on a full stomacke, whereby the meate not being perfectly disgested, breedeth grosse and tough hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, which humours by the extremity of trauell are violently driuen into the small veines, through which the liuer ought to receiue good nutriment, and so by that meanes breedeth obstructions &amp; stoppings. Now from these obstructions (when they haue conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued any long time) especially if the humours be cholericke, breedeth many times hard knobs on the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:26941:67"/>
liuer, which knobbes maketh the horse continually lye on his right side, and neuer on the left; because if he should lye on the left side, the waight of the knob would oppresse the stomacke, and euen sicken all the vitall parts in him. The signes of these obstructions or stoppings, are heauinesse of countenance, distention or swelling, great dulnesse and sloth in the horse when he beginneth his trauell, and a continuall looking backe to his short ribbes, where remaineth his greatest paine and torment. Now the cure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is to seeth continually in the water which hee drinketh, <hi>Agrimony, Fumitory, Camomill, VVorme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, Licoras, Anise seedes, Smallage, Persley, Spicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard, Gentian, Succory, Endyue,</hi> and <hi>Lupyns,</hi> the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues whereof are most comfortable to the liuer. But for as much as the most part of our English Farriers are very simple Smithes, whose capacities are vnable to diue into these seuerall distinctions; and that this worke (or maister peece) is inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the weakest braine whatsoeuer, you shall vnderstand that there bee certaine generall signes to know when the liuer of a horse is grieued with any griefe, of what nature or condition soeuer it be; and so likewise generall receipts, to cure all the grieues without distinguishing or knowing their natures: you shall know then if a horse haue any griefe or paine in his liuer by these signes. First, by a loathing of his meate, next, by the wasting of his flesh, drynesse of his mouth, and roughnesse of his tongue, and great swelling thereof, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing to lye on the side grieued; and lastly, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall looking backeward. Now the generall cures for the sicknesse of the liuer, is, according to the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:26941:68"/>
opinion of the ancient Farriers, to giue the horse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loes dissolued in sweet wine: for it both purgeth and comforteth the liuer. Others vse to giue him to drink <hi>Ireos</hi> stampt and mixt with wine and water together, or in stead of <hi>Ireos,</hi> to giue him <hi>Calamint,</hi> called of the Latines <hi>Pollimonia.</hi> Others giue <hi>Sauery</hi> with oyle &amp; wine mixt together. Others vse liuer-wort and agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony with wine and oyle. Others vse comfortable frictions, and to steepe his prouender in warme wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and to mixe with his prouender a little <hi>Nitrum,</hi> not forgetting to let him stand warme and lye soft; but that which is generally praised aboue all medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, is to giue the horse a Wolfes liuer, beaten to powder, and mixt either with wine, water, oyle, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other medicine.</p>
                     <p>Now for a conclusion of this chapter, if the Farri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers skill be so good that he can distinguish the nature of each seueral infirmity about the liuer, then I would haue him to vnderstand that for inflammations (which are the first beginners of all diseases) would be vsed simples that mollifie and disperse humors, as be these, <hi>Linseed, Fenegreeke, Camomil, Anise seeds, Mellilot,</hi> and such like; to which mollifying simples would be euer added some simples that are astringent or binding, as are these: <hi>red Rose leaues, Bramble leaues, Wormewod, Plantaine, Myrre, Masticke, Storax,</hi> and such like. Now for apostumes, they are to be ripened and voyded, &amp; vlcers must be cleansed and scoured downeward ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by excrement or vrine; and therefore the vse of such simples as prouoke either the one or the other (of which you shall find plenty in other chapters) is most necessary.</p>

                     <p>OF this consumption of the liuer, I haue spoken something in the chapter of the mourning of the chine; yet because amongst our best Farriers it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersly taken, I will shew you their diuers opinions. First, some hold it cometh onely from sudden cold after heate, taken either by drinking or standing still. Others hold it cometh of any humour, especially of cholericke matter, shead throughout the whole sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the liuer, which rotting by leasurable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, doth in the end corrupt and confound all the substance of the liuer, proceeding as they thinke, from corrupt meates, and sweet drinkes: and the last thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it cometh by extreme heate gotten in trauell, which inflaming the bloud doth afterward putrifie, corrupt, and exulcerate the whole substance of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: because the liuer is spongious like the lungs, therefore the cure of this disease is held desperate; yet it bringeth no speedy or suddaine death, but a wasting and lingring infirmity: for the liuer being corrupted, disgestion is taken away, and so the body for want of good nutriment, doth in time consume. The signes of this disease is a loathing of meate, and a stretching forth of the horses body at length as he standeth; hee will seldome or neuer lye downe, his breath will stink maruellously, and he will continually cast exceeding foule matter either at one nosthrell or at both, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as one side or both sides of the liuer is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed: and on that side which hee casteth, hee will euer haue betwixt his nether iawes, about the midst of them, a hard knobbe or kirnell about the bignesse
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:26941:69"/>
of a wal-nut. Now the preseruatiue for this disease, (for in truth it is incurable) is, according to the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of some Farriers, to take halfe a pint of malm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey, and as much of the bloud of a young pigge, and to giue it the horse luke warme to drinke. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Farriers vse to giue the horse no other food for the space of three dayes, then warme wort, and oates baked in an ouen, being sure that the horse be kept fasting the first night before he receiue his medicine.

                     <p>AS is the liuer, euen so the gall of a horse is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to diuers and many infirmities, as to obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, from whence floweth the fulnesse and empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the bladder, and stone in the gall; and these
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:26941:69"/>
obstructions do chance two seuerall waies: first when the passage by which choler should passe from the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vnto the bladder of the gall, as vnto his proper receptacle is stopped, and so the bladder of the gall remaineth empty: for you are to vnderstand that the gall is none other thing then a long, slender, little greenish bladder fixed vnderneath the liuer, which doth receiue all the cholericke bitter moysture, which would otherwise offend not onely the liuer, but the whole body also. Now if the passage vnto this neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary vessell be stopped, there cannot chuse but follow many infirmities, as either vomiting, the laxe, or the bloudy flixe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, when the way whereby such choler should issue forth of the bladder of the gall downe into the guts and excrements, is closed vp, and so su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peraboundeth with too much choler; from whence springeth dulnesse of spirit, suffocating, belching, heate, thirst, and disposition to rage and fury; and truly to any beast there is not a more dangerous dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease then the ouerflowing of the gall. The signes of both these kindes of euils or obstructions, are yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lownesse of the skinne infected with yellow iaundise, and a continuall costiuenesse of the body: and the cure of them are, according to the most ancient Farriers, to giue the horse milke and great store of saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron, boyled together, or in stead of milke to giue ale, saffron, and anise seedes mixed together. But there be other Farriers, with whom I much more do agree, which hold that selladine roots and leaues chopt and bruised, &amp; boiled in beere, or for want of selladine, rue or hearbe of grace, and giuen the horse luke warme to drinke, is most soueraigne.</p>

                     <p>THe Spleene is a long, narrow, flat, spongy sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, of a pale fleshy colour, ioyning with the liuer &amp; the gall; it is the receptacle of melancholy and the dregges of the bloud, and is as subiect to infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as any inward member whatsoeuer, as to inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, obstructions, knobbes and swellings; it through the sponginesse is apt to sucke in all manner of filth, and to dilate and spread the same ouer the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: the appearance thereof, is on the left side vnder the short ribs, where you shall perceiue some small swelling, which swelling giues great griefe to the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffe, especially after a full stomacke, taking away much more of the horses disgestion then his appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, and being suffered to continue, it makes faint the heart, and growes in the end to a hard knob, or stony substance.</p>
                     <p>This disease or diseases of the spleene, are incident to horses most in the Summer, proceeding from the surfaite or greedy eating of greene meates. The signe of which diseases are these, heauinesse, dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, paine on the left side, and hard swellings, short

The cure according to the opinion of our best Farriers, is to make the horse sweate either by la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour or cloathes, then to giue him to drinke a quart of white wine, wherein hath bene boyled the leaues of <hi>Tamariske</hi> bruised, and a good quantity of comin seede beaten to powder, and giue it luke warme.

Others make the horse a drinke of garlicke, nitrum, hore-hound, and wormewood, sodden in sharpe wine, and to bathe all the horses leftside with warme water, and to rubbe it hard. There be others which vse to cauterize or scarifie the horses left side with a hot yron; but it is barbarous and vile, and carrieth no iudgement in the practise.</p>

                     <p>AS before I sayd, from the obstructions or ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowings of the gall and spleene doth spring this disease which our common Smiths call the yellowes, and our better Farriers the iaundise; and you shall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that of this yellowes or iaundise there are two kinds, the first an ouerflowing of choler procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from the sicknesse of the gall, and it is called sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:26941:71"/>
the yellowes, or yellow iaundise; because the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts of the body, as eyes, skinne, mouth, inside of the lips, and such like, are dryed, and coloured yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: the other an ouerflowing of melancholy procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from the sicknesse of the spleene, &amp; is called the blacke yellows or blacke iaundise, because all the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts are blacke. Now both these iaundises or yellowes haue their beginnings from the euils of the liuer; the yellow iaundise when the liuer by inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, hath all his bloud conuerted into choler, and so ouerwhelmes the body: and the blacke iaundise when some obstruction in the liuer veine, which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the spleene, hindreth the spleene from doing his office, and receiuing the dregges of bloud from the liuer; or else when the spleene is surcharged with such dregges of the bloud, and so sheddeth them back againe into the veines. Now although this distinction of the blacke iaundise or blacke yellowes, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare strange vnto our common Farriers; yet it is most certaine that whensoeuer a horse dyeth of the yellowes, he dyeth onely of the blacke yellowes: for when it cometh vnto the case of mortality, then are al the inward powers conuerted to blacknesse, and the yellow substance is cleane mastered; but whilest the matter is yellow, so long the horses body is in good state of recouery. Besides, these yellowes do euer fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low one the other, and the lesser hath no sooner got preheminence, but the greater pursues him; of all the inward diseases in a horse body, this is most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, oftest in practise, and yet most mortal if it be not early preuented. The signes of this disease of yellow iaundise, are yellownesse of eyes, nosthrels, inside of lippes, the skinne, the yard and the vrine: his eares and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:26941:71"/>
his flankes will sweate, and he will groane when he lyeth downe, and he will not onely be faint, but vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly forsake his meate also. The cures which are at this day in practise for this disease, are infinite, and a world of them corrupt and poysonous: euery Smith almost making a medicine of his owne inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, God knowes weake and to little purpose; but for the best receipts which at this day are vsed by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good Farrier whatsoeuer, I will deliuer you the whole catologue.</p>
                     <p>First, for the ancient Farriers, both Italian &amp; French, they did vse to take of tyme and comin, of each like quantity, and stamping them together to mingle it with wine, hony, and water; and then to let him bloud in the pasternes.</p>
                     <p>But now the Farriers of latter dayes vse, first to let the horse bloud in the necke veine, suffering him to bleede till you perceiue the bloud to grow pure; then to giue him this drinke: Take of white wine or ale a quart, and put thereunto of saffron, of turmericke, of each halfe an ounce, and the iuyce that is wrong out of a great handfull of selladine, and being luke warme giue it the horse to drinke; then keepe him warme the space of three or foure dayes, giuing him warme water with a little branne in it. Others vse after the horse is let bloud in the necke veine: First to rake him then to gim him a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positary made of Salt, Hony, and Marioram, and then giue him to drinke, halfe an ounce of myrre, dissolued in a quart of wine or ale. Others vse to giue after bloud letting, onely cold water and ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum mixt together. There be others which after bloud letting, will onely stoppe his eares with
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:26941:72"/>
felladine, and then bind them fast vp, and let him haue no exercise for twelue howres after. Others vse after the letting him bloud to giue him a glister; then to take saffron and turmericke, and mixing them with a quart of milke to giue it him to drinke luke warme. Others vse to let the horse bloud in the third barre of the roofe of his mouth with a sharpe knife, and after he hath bled well, to take a halfe peny worth of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish saffron, and a peny worth of turmericke, and a new layed egge, with the shell and all small broken, and mixe it in a quart of stale ale or beere; and so set him vp warme. Others vse to take after bloud let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of turmericke and of saffron a like quantity, and two or three cloues, and sixe spoonefull of vinegar or verdges, and to put into each eare of the horse, three spoonefull thereof, and then stoppe his eares with black wolle, &amp; so tye them vp for seuen or eight dayes after. Others take long pepper, graines, turmericke, and licoras, all beaten into fine powder; then brew them with a quart of strong beere or ale, and giue it the horse to drinke. Others vse after raking &amp; bloud letting to take the iuyce of Iuy leaues, &amp; mingling it with wine, to squirt it into the horses nosthrels; and to let him drinke only cold water mixt with vitrum, and let his foode be grasse, or new hay sprinkled with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Thus you haue seene, I dare well affirme, all the best practises which are at this day knowne for this disease; &amp; where they all faile<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there is no hope of cure; yet let me thus farre further informe you. This disease of the yellowes or iaundise, if the keeper or maister be not a great deale the more skilfull and carefull, will steale vpon you vnawares, and (as I haue often seene) when you are in the middest of your iourney, remote
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:26941:72"/>
and distant farre from any towne that can giue you succour, it may be your horse will fall downe vnder you, and if you should let him rest till you fetch him succour, questionlesse hee will bee dead. In this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity you haue no helpe but to draw out a sharpe poynted knife, dagger, or rapier for a neede, and as neare as you can (opening the horses mouth) strike him bloud about the third barre of the roofe of his mouth; and so letting him eate and swallow his owne blood a good while, then raise him vp, and be sure he will go as fresh as euer he did; but after you come to place of rest, then bee sure to bloud him and drench him as aforesayd, or else there will a worse fit come vpon him. Now to conclude for the blacke iaundise, which of some Farriers is called the dry yellow, though for mine owne part I hold it to be incurable, yet there be other Farriers which are of a contrary humour, and prescribe this physicke for the cure thereof: first, to giue the horse a glister made of oyle, water, and nitrum, after his fundament is raked; then to powre the decoction of mallowes, mingled with sweete wine, into his nosthrels, and let his meate be grasse, or hay sprinkled with water, and a little nitre, and his prouender dryed oates: hee must rest from labour, and be often rubbed. Now there be other Farriers, which for this disease would onely haue the horse drinke the decoction of wilde cole-worts sodden in wine; the effects of all which I onely referre to experience.</p>

                     <p>WHereas we haue spoken before of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption of the flesh, which proceedeth from surfaits, ill lodging, labour, colds, heates, and such like: you shall also now vnderstand, that there is another drinesse or consumption of the flesh, which hath no apparant cause or ground, and is called of Farriers a dropsie or euill habite of the body; which is most apparantly seene when the horse by dislike doth leese his true naturall colour, as when baynesse turnes to dunnesse, blackes to duskishnes, &amp; whites to ashinesse; and when he leeseth his spirit, strength, and alacrity. Now this cometh not from the want of nutriment, but from the want of good nutriment, in that the bloud is corrupted either with fleame, choler, or melancholy, coming (according to the opinion of the best Farriers) either from the spleene, or the weaknes of the stomacke or liuer causing naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty disgestion. Others thinke it cometh from fowle fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, or much idlenesse; but for mine owne part, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit I haue had as much tryall of this disease, as any one man; and that it becometh not me, to controll men of approued iudgements; yet this I dare auerre, that I neuer saw this disease of the euill habite or euill colour of the body, spring from any other groundes, then either disorderly and wilde riding: or from hunger, or barraine woody keeping. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt it and the dropsie, there is small or no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: for the dropsie being diuided into three kindes, this is the first thereof, as namely an vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:26941:73"/>
swelling of the body, but especially the legges, through the aboundance of water lying betweene the skinne and the flesh. The second, a swelling in the couering or bottome of the belly, as if the horse were with foale; which is onely a whayish hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour abiding betwixt the skinne and the rimme: and the third a swelling in the same place by the like humour, abiding betwixt the great bagge and the kell. The signes of this disease are shortnesse of breath, swelling of the body or legges, losse of the horses na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall colour, no appetite vnto meate, and a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all thirst; his backe, buttockes, and flankes, will be dry, and shrunke vp to their bones; his veines will be hidde that you cannot see them; and wheresoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer you shall presse your finger hard against his body, there you shall leaue the print thereof behind you, and the flesh will not rise of a good space af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: when he lyeth downe, he will spreade out his limbes, and not draw them round together, and his haire will shedde with the smallest rubbing. There be other Farriers which make but onely two drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, that is, a wet dropsie, and a windy dropsie; but being examined, they are all one with those recited, haue all the same signes and the same cure, which according to the ancient Farriers is in this sort. First, to let him be warme couered with many cloathes, and either by exercise or otherwise driue him into a sweate; then let his backe and body be rubbed against the haire, and let his foode be for the most part, cole-worts, smallage, and Elming bowes, or what else will keepe his body soluble, or prouoke vrine: when you want this foode, let him eate grasse, or hay sprinckled with water, and sometimes
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:26941:74"/>
you may giue him a kinde of pulse called Ciche, stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped a day and a night in water, and then taken out and layed so as the water may drop away.</p>
                     <p>There be other Farriers which only would haue the horse to drinke parsley stampt and mixt with wine, or else the roote of the hearbe called <hi>Panax</hi> stampt and mixt with wine. Now whereas some Farriers aduise to slit the belly a handfull behinde the nauell, that the winde and water may leasurely issue forth, of mine owne knowledge I know the cure to be most vile; nor can it be done, but to the vtter spoyle and killing of the horse: for a horse is a beast, &amp; wanting know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his owne good, will neuer be drest but by violence, and that violence will bring downe his kell, so as it will neuer be recouered. Now for these dropsies in the belly, although I haue shewed you the signes and the cures, yet are they rare to be found, and more rare to be cured; but for the other dropsie, which is the swelling of the legges, and the losse of the colour of the haire, it is very ordinary and in howrely practise: the best cure wherof, that euer I found, is this. Take of strong ale a gallon, &amp; set it on the fire, &amp; skum off the white frothwhich riseth: then take a handfull of wormwood without stalke, and as much rue in like manner without stalkes, and put them into the ale, and let them boyle till it be come almost to a quart, then take it off, and straine it exceedingly: then dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue into it three ounces of the best treacle, and put in also an ounce and a halfe of long pepper, and graines beaten to very fine powder: then brew them all together till it be no more but luke warme, and so giue it the horse to drinke; the next day let him bloud on the necke veine, and annoynt his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legges
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:26941:74"/>
with traine ovle, and so turne him into good grasse, and feare not his recouery.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. 67. Of the diseases in the Guts of a horse, and first of the Cholicke.</head>
                     <p>THe guts of a horse are subiect to many and sundry infirmities, as namely, to the winde cholike, fretting of the belly, costiuenesse, laxe, bloudy flixe, and wormes of diuers kinds. Now for the cholicke, it is a grieuous and tormenting paine in the great gut or bagge, which because it is very large and spacious, and full of empty places, it is the more apt to receiue diuers offencied matters, which do breede diuers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, especially winde, which finding no ready passage out, maketh the body, as it were, swell, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth both the stomacke &amp; other inward members. This disease doth not so much appeare in the stable as abroad in trauell: and the signes are these: the horse will often offer to stale but cannot, he will strike at his belly with his hinder foote, and many times stampe, he will forsake his meate, and towards his flanke you shall see his belly appeare more ful then ordinary, and he will desire to lye downe and wallow. The cure thereof according to the most ancient Farriers, is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to giue him a glister made either of wild cowcum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, or else of hens dung, nitrum, and strong vinegar, the manner whereof you shall see in the chapter of glisters; and after the glister labour him.</p>
                     <p>Others vse to giue the horse the vrine of a child to drinke, or a glister of sope and salt water. Others vse to giue him fiue drams of myrre in good wine, and then
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:26941:75"/>
gallop him gently thereupon. Others vse to giue him smallage and parsley with his prouender, &amp; then to trauell him till he sweate; but for mine owne part, I hold it best to take a quart of malmsey, of cloues, pepper, cinamon, of each halfe an ounce; of sugar halfe a quarterne, &amp; giue the horse luke warm, &amp; then ride him at least an houre after; but before you ride him annoynt all his flankes with oyle de bay, or oyle of Spike. Now if whilest you ride him he will not dung, you shal then take him, and if neede be, enforce him to dung, by thrusting into his fundament a pild onion iagged crosse-wayes, that the tickling of the iuice may enforce ordure; and by no meanes for foure of fiue dayes let him drinke no cold water, nor eate any grasse or greene corne, but keepe him vpon wholesome dry meate in a warme stable.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. 68. Of Belly-ake, or fretting in the Belly.</head>
                     <p>Besides the cholike, there is also another grieuous paine in the belly, which Farriers cal the belly-ake, or fretting in the belly; and it proceedeth either from eating of greene pulse when it growes on the ground, or raw vndryed pease, beanes or oates: or else when sharpe fretting humours, inflammations, or aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of grosse matter, is gotten betweene the great gut and the panicle. The signes are much wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, great groaning, and often striking at his belly, and gnawing vpon the manger. The cure according to the opinion of some Farriers, is first, to anoynt your hand with sallet oile, or butter, or grease; &amp; then thru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting it in at the horses fundament, pull out as much
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:26941:75"/>
dung as you can reach, which is called raking a horse; then giue him a glister of water and salt mixt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or in stead thereof, giue him a suppositary of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and salt, and then giue him to drinke the powder of centuary and wormwood brewd with a quart of malmsey. Others vse onely to giue the horse a suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitary of New-castle sope, and for mine owne part, I hold it onely the best.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. 69. Of Costiuenesse, or Belly-bound.</head>
                     <p>COstiuenesse or belly-bound is when a horse is so bound in his belly that he cannot dung; it is a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease of all other most incident to running horses, which are kept in a dry and hot dyet. Now my mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, the great Farriers, affirme, that it proceedeth from glut of prouender, or ouer much feeding, and rest; or from winde, grosse humours, or cold, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing obstructions and stoppings in the guts; but I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose (&amp; imagine that all the best keepers of hunting or running horses, will consent with me) that it rather proceedeth from much fasting, whereby the gut wanting fresh substance to fill it, doth out of it owne great heate bake and dry vp that little which it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth: for it is a certaine rule that nothing can ouerflow before it be full. Or else it may proceede from eating too much hot and dry foode, which suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vp the fleame and moysture of the body, leaues not sufficient whereby it may be disgested; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, it is a dangerous infirmity, and is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of many other euils. The signes are onely abstinence from the office of nature (I mean dunging)
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:26941:76"/>
which is most vsuall in all beasts. The cure whereof according to the opinion of the ancientest Farrier, is to take the water wherein mallowes haue bene long boyled to the quantity of a quart; and put thereto halfe a pint of oyle, or in stead thereof halfe a pint of butter very sweete, and one ounce of <hi>Benedicte Laxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue,</hi> and powre that into his fundament glister-wise: then with a string fasten his tayle hard to histuel, and then trot the horse vp and downe a pretty while, that the medicine may worke so much the better; then let his tayle loose, and suffer him to voyd all that is in his belly: then bring him into the stable, and hauing stood a while, giue him a little well clarified hony to drinke; then couer him and keepe him warme, and let his drinke for three or foure dayes, be nothing but sweete mashes of malt and water. Other Farriers vse to take eleuen leaues of Lorell, and stamping them in a morter, giue it the horse to drinke with one quart of strong ale. Others vse to take an ounce of brimstone finely beaten to powder, and mixing it with spurge, to giue it the horse in a mash to drinke. Now for mine owne part, I would wish you, if the disease he not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry extremely violent, onely but to rake the horses fundament, and then to gallop him in his cloathes till he sweate, and then giue him a handfull or two of cleane rye, and a little brimstone mixt with it: for brimstone being giuen with prouender at any time, will scoure; but if the disease be raging and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, take a quarter of a pound of white sope, and a handfull of spurge, bray them very well together, and giue it the horse to drinke with a quart of ale luke warme; then let him fast and exercise him more then halfe an howre after, and be sure to keepe him very
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:26941:76"/>

                     <p>THe laxe, or open fluxe of a horses body, is a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous disease, and quickly bringeth a horse to great weaknes and faintnes: it proceedeth sometimes from the aboundance of cholericke humors, descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from the liuer or gall down into the guts: some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by drinking ouermuch cold water immediately after prouender, sometimes by sodaine trauelling vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a full stomacke before his meate be digested, somtimes by hasty running or galloping presently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter water; &amp; sometimes by licking vp a feather, or ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting hens dung: there is no disease that taketh more sore vpon a horse in short time then this; and yet sith nature her selfe in this disease seemeth to be a Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the horses body, I would not wish any Farrier to go about too suddenly to stop it; but if you finde that by the continuance, nature both leeseth her owne strength, and the horse the good estate of his body, then you shall seeke remedy, and the cure thereof ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the opinion of ancient Farriers, is this. Take of beane flowre and <hi>Bolarmony,</hi> of each a quarterne; mixe them together in a quart of redde wine, and giue it the horse luke warme to drinke, &amp; let him be kept very warme and haue much rest: also let the water that he drinketh be luke warme, and mixt with beane flowre; yet by no meanes let him drinke aboue once in foure and twenty howres; and then
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:26941:77"/>
not to his full satisfaction. Others take a pint of redde wine, the powder of one nutmegge, halfe an ounce of cinamon, and as much of the rinde of a pomegranat, and mixing them together, giue it the horse luke warme to drinke; and let him not drinke any other drinke, except it be once in foure and twenty howres, halfe a horses draught of warme water mixt with beane flowre. Others take a halfe peny worth of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume beaten into fine powder, and <hi>Bole-armony</hi> bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten small, and a quart of good milke; mingle them together till the milke be all on a curd, and then giue it the horse to drinke, obseruing the dyet before rehearsed; but if this disease shall happen to a suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing foale, as commonly it will, and I my selfe haue seene many that for want of experience haue peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed thereby, you shall then onely giue it a pint of strong verdges to drinke, and it is a present remedy: for the foale feeding only vpon milke, and that milke auoyding in as liquid forme as it was receiued, the verdges will curdell it, &amp; so make it auoyd in a grosser and more tougher substance.</p>

                     <p>IT is not to be doubted but that a horse may haue the bloudy flixe, for in my experience I haue seene it, besides the confirmation of all my maisters, the old Farriers. Now of the bloudy flixe they make diuers kindes: for somtimes the fat of the slimyfilth which is voyded, is sprinkled with a little bloud: sometimes the excrement is a watrish bloud like the water wherein bloudy flesh hath bene washed: sometimes
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:26941:77"/>
bloud mixed with melancholy, and sometimes pure bloud; but all these proceeding from one head, which is the exulceration of the gut, they may all very well be helped one cure. Yet that you may know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the exulceration bee in the inward small guts, or in the outward great guts, you shall obserue i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> the matter and bloud be perfectly mixt together, then it is in the inner small guts; but if they be not mixed, but come out seuerally, the bloud most commonly follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing the matter, then it is in the thicke outward guts. Now this bloudy flixe cometh most commonly of some sharp humors, ingendred either by naughty raw food, or vnreasonable trauell; which humours being violently driuen, and hauing to passe through many crooked &amp; narrow wayes, do cleaue to the guts, and with their heate and sharpnesse fret them, &amp; cause ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulceration &amp; grieuous paine. Sometimes this bloudy flixe may come from extreme cold, extreme heate, or extreme moistnesse, or through the violence of some extreme scouring formerly giuen, wherein some poysonous simple, as <hi>Scamony, Stibium,</hi> or such like, might be applyed in too great a quantity; or it may come from the weaknesse of the liuer, or the other members which serue for disgestion. The signes of this disease, is onely the auoyding bloud with his excrements, or bloud in stead of excrements: and the cure according to the opinion of the ancient Farriers, is to take saffron one ounce, of <hi>Myrre</hi> 2 ounces, of sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thernwood 3 ounces, of parsley 1 ounce, of rue 3 oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, of spittlewort &amp; hyssop of each 2 ounces, of cassia which is like cinamon, one ounce; let all these be bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten into fine powder, &amp; mingled with chalk &amp; strong vinegar, wrought into paste; of which paste make little
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:26941:78"/>
cakes, and dry them in the shadow, and being dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, dissolue some of them in a pint and a halfe of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley milke, or for want thereof, in that iuyce which is called <hi>Cremor ptisanae,</hi> and giue it the horse to drinke: for it not onely cureth the bloudy flixe, but being gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen with a quart of warme water, it healeth all griefe and paine either in the belly or bladder, which cometh for want of staling. Now for mine owne part, I haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vsed for the bloudy flixe but this medicine only. Take of red wine 3 pints, halfe a handful of the hearbe called <hi>Bursa Pastoris,</hi> or shepheards purse, and as much Tanners barke taken out of the fat and dryed; boyle them in the wine till somewhat more then a pint be consumed, and then straining it very hard, giue it the horse luke warme to drinke: if you do adde vnto it a little cinamon, it is not amisse. There be other Farriers which vse to dissolue in a pint of red wine foure ounces of the sirrop of slowes, and giue it the horse to drinke; but either of the other medicines are fully sufficient.</p>

to dung when a horse is costiue, and partly by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer great moysture, as it happens in young children: for then a horse, no creature hath a moyster body. Now the signe is the apparant hanging downe of the fundament, and the cure is this.

                     <p>MY Maisters, the old Farriers, are of opinion that the guts of a horse do breede three sorts of
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:26941:79"/>
wormes, that is to say, little short wormes with great red heads, and long smal white tayles, which we call bots; short &amp; thick worms all of a bignesse like a mans finger, which we call Truncheons; and great long wormes as bigge as a mans finger, and at least sixe inches in length, which we call by the simple name of wormes onely.</p>
                     <p>Now for mine part, I am of opinion, that the first which are bots, are not bred in the guts but in the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke onely; because hauing cut vp many horses, I neuer could finde any one bot in the guts, yet great store of both the other wormes; nor euer cut vp the stomacke of a horse, but I found great aboundance of bots, and neither of the other wormes: whence I am confidently opiniated, that bots are euer bred in the stomacke, and both the other sorts of wormes in the guts: truth it is, that all three do proceede from one selfe cause, which is a raw, grosse, &amp; flegmatike matter apt to putrifaction, and ingendred by foule &amp; naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty feeding; and as they proceede from one selfe cause, so haue they all one signe and one cure. The signes then are, the horse will forsake his meate, and not stand vpon his legges, but wallow and tumble, and beate his belly with his feete; and sometimes the paine will be so extreme that he will beate his head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the ground; and truly the violence of these wormes are wonderfull: for I haue seene horses whose stomacks haue bene eaten quite through with them, so that the meate which they ate, could not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in their stomacke, but fell vpon the swallowing into the body, making the body swell like a tun, and so haue dyed with huge torment. Now the cure, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ancientest Farriers, is to take a quart
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:26941:79"/>
of sweete milke, of hony a quarterne, and giue it him luke warme; then walke him vp and downe for the space of an houre after, and so let him rest for that day with as little meate and drinke as may be; and by no meanes suffer him to lye downe. The next day when the horse is fasting, take of rue a handfull, of Sauin as much, and being well stampt, put thereunto a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle brimstone, and a little foote of a chimney beaten into fine powder; put all these things together in a quart of wort or new ale, and there let them lye in steepe the space of an howre or two, then straine it hard through a faire cloath, and giue it the horse to drinke luke warme: then bridle him and walke him abroad the space of an howre, then set him vp, and let him stand on the bit, two or three howres after, and then giue him a little hay. Other Farriers vse on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to giue the horse for this disease, the warme guts of a new slaine henne or chicken, being thrust downe the horses throate; and sure it is passing good, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if a little salt be mixed with them: and this must be done three mornings together fasting, kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the horse from drinking three or foure howres after. Others vse to take three ounces of the rootes of Caphers beaten with halfe so much vinegar, and put it downe the horses throate: or else a pint of milke, &amp; a spoonfull of sope giuen the horse to drinke, or brimstone and milke giuen to drinke, all be very so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne. Others vse to binde about the snafle or bit mans dung new made, and so ride him therewith. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers take of <hi>Gentian, Aloes,</hi> and <hi>Sauin,</hi> of each halfe an ounce, and brew them together with hony and strong ale. Others vse to take onely a quart of cold sweete wort. Others take <hi>Sauin</hi> &amp; <hi>Southerwort,</hi> or else
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:26941:80"/>
wormewood, and the tops of broome small chopt, and mixe it with the horses prouender. Others vse to giue the horse to drinke luke warme, elder berries sodden in milke. Others vse to giue the horse with his prouender, his owne haire chopt small, and mixt with bay salt. Others put hot embers in water, and presently straine it and giue it the horse to drinke. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers make little round balles of honey, and the fine powder of chalke, and putting them into ale make the horse swallow them. Others vse to take, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the long wormes, a halfe peny worth of Fene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeke, of anise seedes, a quarter of a pound, a halfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peny worth of bay berries, as much licoras, and as much turmericke, and a little quantity of brimstone; beate them into powder, put them into a quart of ale, and giue it the horse fasting luke warme to drinke; then ride him an howre after, then set him vp warme foure and twenty howres after. Others vse, especially for the Truncheons, to take two spoonefull of the powder of wormewood, finely fearst, and put it in a pint of good malmsey, and after it is brewd a while, let it stand and soake all night; then giue it the horse in the morning fasting, then keepe him without meate or drinke foure houres after. Others vse to giue the horse to drinke, two spoonefull of wormeseede, &amp; as much brimstone or powder of Sauin, with a quart of malmsey, ale, or beere. Others vse to take as much blacke sope as a wal nut, and as much brimstone bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to powder, and a heade or two of garlicke pild &amp; bruised, and put into a quart of good ale, and giue it the horse luke warme to drinke. This medicine also may be administred to a Mare great with foale if she be troubled with the bots or other wormes, so that
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:26941:80"/>
the blacke sope be left out; for it is a violent purger, and may kill the foale in the mares belly; yet for mine owne part, I neuer giue any inward physicall medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine to a mare great with foale; but if I finde her to be troubled with wormes, as is easie to be done by the stinking of her breath, by the sliminesse of her mouth, and by the greatnesse of the worme veines vnder her lips: then presently I do nothing but let her bloud in the roofe or palat of her mouth, and make her eate her owne bloud: for that I know, will both kill worms, and help most inward maladyes. But leauing mares with foale, let vs returne againe vnto horses. There be other Farriers which vse to take a handfull of new hens dung, &amp; a quart of stale ale, and braying them well together, then take a handfull of bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salt, and put two egges to it, and hauing mixt them all well together, giue it the horse to drinke, Others vse to take a halfe peny worth of saffron, and as much allum, and mixe them with a pint of milke, and giue it the horse to drinke: or else giue him greene willow and greene reede to eate. Others vse (and thinke it the best of all other medicines) to take the guttes of a young hen, or pidgeon, and rolle it first in a little blacke sope, then in baysaylt, and so force it downe the horses throate. Others vse (especially for the Truncheons) to let the horse drinke hennes dung, mints, sage, and rue, with beere or ale, and to let him bloud in the nosthrels. To conclude, except you see the horse very much pained, you shall need to giue him nothing but rosen and brimstone mixt together, and blended with his prouender, hauing care that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer you giue it fasting, and long before the horse do drinke.</p>

The signes are, the horse will go rolling and staggering behind, his vrine will bee blackish and thicke, and his stones, if he haue any, will be shrunke vp into his body; if he haue none, you shall perceiue the sheath of his yard to be drawne backeward, and the great veine which runneth vp the inside of his thigh, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the kidney veine, will flacke and beate continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. The cure according to the opinion of the ancient Farriers, is first, to bathe his backe and loynes, with oyle, wine and <hi>Nitrum,</hi> warmed together; and after he is bathed couer him with warme clothes, and let him stand in litter vp to the belly; then giue him to drinke water wherein hath ben sodden dill, fennell,

anise seedes, smallage, parsley, spicknard, myrre, and cassia, or as many as you can conueniently get of these simples. The next morning fasting giue him to drinke, a quart of ewes milke, or for want thereof, halfe so much sallet oyle, and Deeres suet molten together: or, if you can get it, the roote of daffadill boyled in wine, and let his prouender bee dryed oates; and in this dyet keepe him about tenne dayes, and he will recouer.</p>

                     <p>ACcording to the determinate opinion of all the best &amp; ancientest Horse-leaches, the bladder of a horse is subiect to three dangerous diseases, as first, the Strangury or Strangullion; the second, the Paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pisse; &amp; the third, the Stone, or Pissupprest. Now for the first, which is the strangury or strangullion, it is, when the horse is prouoked to stale often, and auoydeth nothing but a few droppes: it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth questionlesse, either by the heate &amp; sharpnesse of vrine, caused either by great traueil, or by sharpe and hot meates and drinkes, or else by the exulce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the bladder, or by meanes of some ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postume in the liuer and kidneyes, which apostume being broken, the matter resorteth downe into the bladder, &amp; with the sharpnes thereof causeth a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall prouocation of pissing. The signes are (as I sayd before) a continuall desire to pisse, yet auoiding no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a few drops, &amp; those with such pain, that he will whiske, wry, and beate his taile as he pisseth.</p>

                     <p>THis disease of Paine-pisse, is when a horse cannot pisse but with great paine and labour, and doth proceede sometimes from the weaknesse of the blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the cold intemperature thereof; and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times through the aboundance of fleame and grosse humors stopping the necke of the bladder: the signes whereof are, the horse will stretch himselfe out as though he would stale, and thrust out his yard a little, and with the paine clap his taile betwixt his thighes to his belly, and hauing stood so a good while, in the end stale a good quantity. The cure whereof, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the opinion of some Farriers, is to take the iuyce of leekes, sweete wine and oyle, and mingling them together, to powre it into his right nosthrel, and walke him a little vp and downe vpon it: or else to giue him to drinke smallage seede, or else the roote of wilde fennell sodden with wine. Others vse to put fine sharpe onions cleane pild, and a little bruised into his fundament, and then to chafe him immediatly
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:26941:82"/>
vpon it, either by riding him, or running him in a mans hand; or else to take the scraping of the inward parts of the horses owne houes, beaten into powder, and mingled with wine, and powre it into his right nosthrell, and then ride him vpon it. Others vse to leade the horse to a sheepe-coate, or sheepe-pen, where great store of sheepe are wonted: and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the horse to smell of the dung and pisse of the sheepe, it will prouoke him to stale presently.

                     <head>CHAP. 77. Of the Stone or Pissupprest in a Horse</head>
                     <p>THe stone or pissupprest in a horse, is when a horse would faine stale, but cannot at all; and therefore may well be called the suppression of of the vrine: it proceedeth according to the opinions of my masters, the old Farriers, sometimes from the weaknesse of the bladder, when the water conduit is stopped with grosse humours, or with matter descending from the liuer; or from some inflammation or hard knobs gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing at the mouth of the conduit; or for that the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes of the bladder are numbed, so as the bladder is without feeling: or it may come by keeping a horse in long trauell, and not suffering him to stale; but most commonly and oftest it cometh from obstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the kidneyes, where, by the causes aforesayd, a certaine redde grauell being bred and falling downe into the conduits, by the mixture of fleame and other
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:26941:83"/>
grosse humours, is there brought to be a hard stone, and so stoppeth the passage of the vrine: for the signes there needeth no more but this, that he would faine pisse, but cannot. The cure accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the opinion of the most ancientest Farriers, is first to draw out his yard and bethe it well with white wine, and pricke it and scoure it well, lest it be stopped with durt and filthinesse; then put a little oile of camomill into his yard with a waxe candle, and a bruised cloue of garlike; but if that will not force him to stale, then take of parsley two handfuls, of cori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander one handful: stamp them and straine them with a quart of white wine, &amp; dissolue therein one ounce of cake sope, and giue it luke warme vnto the horse to drinke; and see that you keepe him as warme as may be, and let him drinke no cold water for the space of fiue or sixe dayes; and when you would haue him to stale, let it either bee vpon good plenty of straw, or vpon the grasse, or in a sheep-coate. Others (&amp; those of the best esteeme for Horse-leach-craft at this day) vse onely to giue white wine, cake sope, and butter ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well mixt together, and let the horse drinke it warme. Others vse to annoynt the horses belly first with warme water; then when it is dryed, to annoynt it againe with sallet oyle, horse-grease and tarre mixt together and made warme, and to hold a hot yron a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his belly whilest it is in annoynting, that the oyntment may the better enter the skin: but I hold this medicine to be much better for the strangury or any other paine in the belly then for the stone; yet it is approued good for all. Others vse to take a pint of white wine or ale, &amp; mixe with it a little garlicke, and the whites of ten egges, &amp; giue it the horse to drinke:
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:26941:83"/>
or else giue him the iuice of red cole-worts, mixt with white wine, or the roote of <hi>Alexanders,</hi> bruised &amp; sod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in wine to drinke, &amp; wash his yard with vinegar. Others vse to take either wormewood, southerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, or galingale, or mallowes, or pimpernell; some of these, or any one of these, stampt and strained, and giue it the horse with ale to drinke. Others vse to take a pint of white wine, halfe a pint of burre seede bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten very small, two ounces of parsley seede, halfe a handfull of hyssop, halfe an ounce of blacke sope; mixe them all well together, and warme it, and giue it the horse to drinke: or else take vnset leekes, and stampe them small, and sope, milke and butter; and being mixt together, giue it the horse to drinke. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers vse to take a nutmegge and a handfull of parsley seed, beate them to powder; then take as much but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and mixe them altogether in a quart of strong ale, and giue it the horse luke warme to drinke: or else take the seede of smallage, parsley, <hi>Saxefrace,</hi> the roots of <hi>Philupendula,</hi> cherry-stone kirnels, grummell seeds, and broome seedes, of each a like quantity; beat them into fine powder, and giue it the horse with a pint or a quart of white wine. Now albeit all these medicines before rehearsed, are in dayly practise, and approued very soueraigne, yet for mine owne part, I haue found none more soueraigne then this. Take a quart of strong ale, and put it into a pottle pot: then take as many keene radish rootes, cleane washed, being slit through and bruised, as will fill vp the pot: then stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the pot very close that no ayre may come in, let it so stand foure and twenty howres; then straine the ale and the rootes very hard into a cleane vessell, and giue it the horse fasting in the morning to drinke:

                     <p>THere is nothing more certaine then that a horse many times will pisse bloud in stead of vrine, the cause (as the most ancient Farriers suppose) procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from some one of these grounds: either ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much labour, or too heauy a burthen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> especially when the horse is fat: for by either of them the horse may come to breake some veine in his body, and then you shall see cleare bloud come out, &amp; no vrine at all; but if the bloud be mixt with vrine, then they suppose it cometh from the kidneyes, hauing some ragged stone therein, which through great trauell doth fret the veines of the kidneyes, and makes them bleed, through which as the vrine passeth, it taketh the bloud away with it also; but for mine owne part, I haue not found any greater cause for the pissing of bloud then the taking vp of a horse from grasse in the strength of winter (as about Christmas) and present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without a dayes rest in the stable, to thrust him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a long and weary iourney: from this cause I haue seene many horses after two or three daies iourney to pisse bloud in most grieuous manner. The signes are needlesse. The cure according to the opinion of the ancient Farriers, is this: First, let the horse bloud in the palate of the mouth, to conuert the bloud the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary way; then take of <hi>Tragagant</hi> which hath bene steeped in wine halfe an ounce, &amp; of poppy seed, one
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:26941:84"/>
dramme, and one scruple, and of <hi>Storax</hi> as much, and twelue pine-apple kirnels; let all these things be bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and mingled well together, and giue the horse thereof euery morning the space of seuen dayes the quantity of a wal-nut, infused in a quart of sweete wine. Other latter Farriers vse to let the horse bloud in the necke, and boyle that bloud with wheate, and with the powder of dryed pomegranate pils; then straine it, and giue it him three or foure mornings to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to drinke; and let him by no meanes trauell thereupon: or else giue him of husked beanes boyled with the huskes of acornes, beaten smal, and mixt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Others vse to make him a drinke with the rootes of <hi>Daffadill</hi> mingled with wheate flowre, and <hi>Sumach</hi> sodden long in water, and so to be giuen to the horse with sweet wine: or else to make him a drink of goates milke and sallet oyle, straining thereunto a little frumenty: or else to giue him sodden beanes &amp; Deeres suet in wine; each of these are of like force &amp; goodnesse. Now there be others which for this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease do take barley, and seeth it in the iuyce of Gum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folly, and giue him the barley to eate, and the iuyce to drinke: or else take the powder of licoras and anise seeds, rold vp in hony, and make round balles there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and cast downe the horses throat two or three of them: or else licoras, anise seeds and garlicke bruised together with a little sallet oyle and hony, and giuen in a quart of new milke to the horse to drinke, is very soueraigne also; and these two medicines last rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, are exceeding good also for any cold or glanders.</p>

                     <p>THe colt euill by the most ancient Farriers, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Italians, whose hot country affoordeth the beasts of more hot and strong natures then ours doth, is thought to be a continuall standing together with an vnnaturall swelling of the yard, proceeding either from some winde filling the arteries and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low sinew, or pipe of the yard; or else through the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance of seede prouoked by the naturall heate of the horse; but our Farriers, who haue not seene that experience, because our horses are of colder temper, say it is onely a swelling of the sheath of the yard, and of that part of the belly about the yard, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the codde also, proceeding from corrupt seede which commeth out of the yard, and remaining within the sheath, there putrifieth: and this iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we finde by experience to be most true. Now you shall vnderstand that Geldings as well as horses are subiect thereunto, because they want naturall heat to expell their seed any further. The signes are onely the outward swelling of the sheath and codde, and none other: and the best cure is first to wash the sheath cleane with luke warme vinegar; then draw out the yard and wash that also: which done, ride the horse twice euery day, that is, morning and euening, into some deepe running water vp to the belly, tos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing him to and fro, to allay the heate of members till the swelling be vanished; and if you swim him now &amp; then, it will not do amisse. Others vse to bath his cods and yard with the iuice of houslicke, or with the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wherein kinholme hath beene sod. Now this
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:26941:85"/>
colt euill will sometimes stoppe the horses vrine that he cannot pisse: then you shall take new ale, and a little blacke sope, and giue it the horse to drinke. Others vse to wash the horses coddes and sheath with butter and vinegar made warme. Others vse to wash his yard and coddes with the iuyce of hemlocke, or else take beane flowre, vinegar and <hi>Bolearmonicke,</hi> and mixing them together, lay it plaister-wise to his sheath and coddes. Others make him a plaister of wine-lees, houslicke and branne mixt together, and layd to his sheath and coddes; but if the first receipt will serue, I would not wish you to vse any other medicine.</p>

                     <p>THe shedding of the seed, or the falling away of the sperme in horses, is none other then that which we call in men, the running of the reines: it cometh as our old Farriers say, either by aboundance &amp; rank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of seed, or by the weaknesse of the stones and seede vessels, not able to retaine the seede vntill it be disgested and thickned; but truly for mine owne part, I thinke it cometh oftner (especially amongst our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish horses) by some great straine in leaping, or by teaching a horse to bound, and making him bound the compasse of his naturall strength. The signes are onely the shedding of his seede, which will be white, thinne, and waterish. The cure according to the ancient experiments, is first to ride the horse into some cold water vp to the belly, insomuch that his stones may be couered with water: which done, bathe his fundament with water and oyle; then couer him exceeding warme, and giue him euery day to drinke, red wine and hogges dung till the fluxe of his seede stay; but latter experience hath found this receipt better. Take of red wine a quart, and put therein a little <hi>Acatium,</hi> the iuyce of plantan, and a little ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticke, and giue it him to drinke; and then bath all his backe with red wine, and oyle of roses mixt together; but other Farriers take <hi>Venice</hi> Turpentine, and being washt, beate it well with halfe so much sugar, &amp; then make round balles as bigge as wal-nuts, and giue the horse fiue euery morning till the fluxe stay.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. 82. Of the falling downe of the yard.</head>
                     <p>THe falling downe of the yard is when a horse hath not strength to draw vp his yard within the sheath but lets it hang downe betweene his legges ill fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly: it cometh (as our best Farriers suppose) either through the weaknesse of the member, by meanes of some resolution in the muscles and sinewes seruing the same, caused by some great straine or stripe on the backe: or else through extreme wearinesse and tiring. The signe is only the apparant hanging downe of the member: and the cure is (according to some opinions) to wash the horses yard in salt water from the sea, or for want thereof with water and salt; but if that do not preuaile, then pricke all the outmost skinne of the yard with a sharp needle, but yet as sleightly as may be, &amp; not deep; and then wash all the pricks with strong vinegar, &amp; this will not onely make him draw vp his yard againe, but also if at any time his funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment chance to fall, this cure will put it vp againe.</p>
                     <p>There be other Farriers which for this disease, will put into the pipe of the horses yard, hony and salt boyled together and made liquid, or else a quick flye, or a graine of Franckinsence, or a cloue of gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke cleane pilled and bruised, and bathe his backe with oyle, wine, and <hi>Nitre,</hi> made warme, and min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled together. But the best cure according to our English practise, is first, to wash all the yard with white wine warmed, and then annoynt it with oyle of roses and hony mixt together, and so put it vp into the sheath, &amp; with a little bolster of canuase keep it from falling downe; and dresse him thus once in
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:26941:87"/>
foure and twenty howres, vntill he be recouered, and in any case let his backe be kept as warme as is possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, both with cloth and a charge or plaister made of <hi>Bolearmonicke,</hi> egges, wheat-flower, <hi>Sanguis Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conis,</hi> Turpentine and vinegar, or else lay next his backe a wet sacke, or wet hay, and a dry cloth ouer it, and that will keepe his backe exceeding warme.</p>

                     <p>THe onely disease incident to the wombe of a Mare (as farre fourth as our Farriers are experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced) is barrennesse, which may proceed from diuers causes, as through the vntemperatnesse of the matrix, being either two hot and fierie, or two cold and moist, or too dry, or else too shorte, or too narrow, or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the necke thereof turned awry, or by meanes of some obstruction, or stopping in the matrixe, or in that the Mare is too fat, or too leane, and diuers other such like causes.

if they chance when they go to the water, to see their own shadowes therin, that presently they will fall into an extreme loue therewith, and from that loue into such a hot rage, that they will forget either to eate or drinke, and neuer cease running about the pasture, gazing strangely, and looking oft both about and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde them.

                     <p>PVrging is sayd of our most ancientest Farriers, to bee an emptying and discharging of all super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flouous humours which distemper the body with their euill qualities: for such humours breede euill
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:26941:90"/>
nutriment, which when it will not be corrected nor holpen with good dyet, alteration, nor the benefite of nature and kindly heate, then must it of force ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be taken away by Purgation, Glister, or Supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary. Now forasmuch as a horse is troubled with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diseases in the guts, and that nothing can purge the guts with that gentlenesse which a suppositary doth, I will here first begin to speake of suppositaries.</p>
                     <p>Vnderstand then that a horse being surfaited and full of euill humors, needing to be purged, it is best first to giue him a suppositary; lest if you should come to apply a glister, the great gut being stopped with dry, hard, and hot excrements, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine not able to worke beyond it, leese both labour and vertue; so that I make account the suppositary is but onely a preparatiue to the glister, and but onely to cleanse and make loose the great gut, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to the tuell. The gentlest suppositary then, and that which purgeth fleame in the best manner, is to take a square peece of cake sope, or white New-castle sope, about fiue or sixe inches long, and shauing it round till it be not aboue three inches about in the midst, &amp; a little smaller at each end then in the midst; then annoynt it ouer with sallet oyle, &amp; so with your hand thrust it vp more then a full spanne into his fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dament; then suddenly clappe his taile to his tuell, and hold it hard and close more then halfe an howre, in which space the most part of the supposita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry will be wasted; then gently take away your hand, and let him voyd the suppositary at his pleasure. The next suppositary to this, and which purgeth choler a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundantly, is to take <hi>Sauin</hi> stampt small, staues-aker and salt, and boyle them in hony till it be thicke; then
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:26941:90"/>
take and knead it, and rolle it of a pretty thicke long rolle, as before you were taught for the hard <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ope, and administer it at his tuell. The next to this, and that which purgeth melancholy, is to take a keene onion, and pilling off the skinne, iagge it a little crosse-wise with your knife; and so thrust it vp into the horses fundament. There is besides these suppositaries, one o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther suppositary, which is to take a quart of hony, and boyle it vpon the fire till it come to be thicke like a salue, then powre it forth vpon a table and knead it like a peece of dough: then when it begins to harden or grow stiffe (as it will do when it begins to coole) then rolle it vp vnder your hand, and make it in the forme of a suppositary, as is before shewed, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister it in the same maner. This suppositary is good to purge the gut off any foule humour, and therewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all is comfortable vnto the body.</p>
                     <p>Now you must also vnderstand, that as these suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitaries are preparatiues before glisters, so they are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to be vsed simply of themselues, where the sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the horse carrieth no great danger: for vpon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery sleight occasion, or small drynesse which is to be dissolued with the most gentle medicine, to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster a glister, were to bring the horses body to such an intemperate loosnes as would proue much worse then the contrary drynesse. Therefore I wish euery careful Farrier (because the body of a horse would not be tampered withal with too much physicke) first, in the case of costiuenesse, or inflammation of the inward parts, to approue a suppositary; which if it worke effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually, and keepe the horses body soluble, then to proceede no further; but in case it do not, but that the offensiue matter still increaseth, then to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:26941:91"/>
a glister; and where that faileth to take away the offence, to administer a purgation. Now by the way, you are to take with you this generall rule, and neuer to faile in the performance, which is, neuer to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister either suppositary or glister, but first immediatly before you giue it, to take your horse, which raking is in this maner. First, you shall annoynt all your hand and arme ouer either with sallet oyle, sweete butter, or fresh grease; and then thrust it into the horses fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dament, and draw out all the dung, fleame, and filthy matter that you can feele, euen as high vp as the great bagge: which done, then administer either your suppositary or glister, which you please, at your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; and in any case, whilest the horse is thus in phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke, keepe him exceeding warme.</p>

                     <p>THe natures and properties of glisters are diuers, and therefore it is necessary that euery carefull Farrier learne to know to what end they serue, and with what drugs or simples they ought to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded: for euery glister is to be made according to the disease. Now of glisters, some are to ease griefes, and to allay the sharpnesse of the humours, some to binde, some to loosen, and some to purge, and some to heale vlcers. These glisters by cleansing the guts, refresh the vitall parts, and prepare the way before for euery inward and stronger purgation. Therefore whensoeuer a horse through the grosnesse of humors, corruption of bloud, or aboundance of fleame, cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, or melancholy, is brought vnto that euill habite
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:26941:91"/>
of body, that of necessity he must be purged, and that especially his paine is in his guts and body, you shall then as before I sayd (hauing made a probation of a suppositary) first of all administer a glister; lest by pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging suddenly with any purgation or potion, you stirre vp a multitude of euill humours, which finding no passage downeward (because the guts be stopped with winde and dregges) do strike vpwards, and so perhaps put the horse into much greater danger.</p>
                     <p>Now for the composition of glisters, you shall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand that they be made of foure things, that is, of decoctions, of drugges, of oyle, or such like vnctious matters, as butter, or soft grease; and fourthly of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers salts, to prouoke the vertue expulsiue. A decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is the broth of certaine hearbs and simples boyled together in water vntill the third part be consumed. Now sometimes for want of such decoctions, you may if you please, vse some fat beefe broth, or the broth of a sheeps head, or such like, or milke or whay, or some such like liquor, mingled sometimes either with hony or with sugar, according to the quality of the disease; the glister being either lenitiue, that is to say, easing of paine; or glutinatiue, which is, ioyning of things together; or else abstersiue, which is, wiping away or cleansing of filthy matter. Now of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction or broth being cleane strained, you shall neuer take aboue three pints at the most, and many times but a quart, into which you shall put such drugges as are needfull, exceeding not at the most, aboue three or foure ounces, according as the simples be more or lesse violent: of oyle you shall neuer vse in a glister a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue halfe a pint, and of salt not aboue three or foure drams. You shall also continually administer your
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:26941:92"/>
glister luke warme, either with some long horne, or a large glister pipe made for the purpose, and fixed to the largest bladder you can get; and this glister pipe is of all the best, and doth least loose labour. When you do administer a glister, you shall set the horses hinder parts somewhat higher then his foreparts, and then you shall put the glister pipe in at his tuell into his fundament vp to the head, and hauing the confecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on within the bladder, wring it with good strength into his body. A glister would be administred to a horse when he is rather empty then full paunched, whether it be in the forenoone or after noone. Now for the retaining or holding of the glister in the horses body, three quarters of an howre is sufficient of what quality soeuer it be. Now you are to note by the way, that as soone as the glister is administred into the horses body, you must draw out the pipe with all the gentlenesse that may be, and suddenly clappe his taile to his tuell, and so hold it with your hand, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any mouing or stirring of the horse till the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine haue had his full time of working. Now to come vnto particular glisters, that you may know which gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster is for which purpose, the first is: take of the pulpe of <hi>Coliquintida</hi> halfe an ounce, of <hi>Dragantium</hi> 3 quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of an ounce, of <hi>Centuary</hi> &amp; of wormewod, of each halfe a handfull, of <hi>Castoreum</hi> a quarter of an ounce; boyle them in three pints of water, then being strai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned you shall dissolue therein of <hi>Gerologundinun</hi> three ounces, of salt three quarters of an ounce, and of oyle oliue halfe a pint, and so luke warme administer it gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster wise, as hath bene before expressed: this glister is exceeding soueraigne for the pestilence in horses, or for any feuer of what nature soeuer.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="179" facs="tcp:26941:92"/>The next is to take the decoction of mallowes, and to mixe therewithall, either fresh butter, or sallet oyle, and so luke warme administer it: this is of all glisters the most gentlest, and as the former glister is abster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue or cleansing, so this is leuitiue and a great easer of paine; it is most soueraigne for a horse that is taken, or that hath any contraction or convultion, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally for any costiuenesse in a horse whatsoeuer, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from inward surfaite or sicknesse, as from the surfaite by prouender, foundring in the body, and such like.

                     <p>THe purging of horses is euer by one of these two wayes, either by pils or by potion: pils are any so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid and substantiall stuffe fixed together in one body, and being made into round balles, are cast downe the horses throat; and potion, is when you giue the horse any liquid purging matter to drinke, whether it be purging powders dissolued in wine or ale: or that it be any other liquid stuffe. Now for pils they onely purge and make cleane the head and braine, bringing fleame and other grosse humours downe into the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements; and potions cleanse the stomacke, guts, and
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:26941:93"/>
euery other inward member. Now the art of the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Farrier is in choosing the simples, whereof these pils or potions are to be compounded, and in aptly or artificially applying the same. First then, it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that euery Farrier (before he go about to purge his horse) know with what ill humour a horse is opprest, as whether it proceede from choler, fleame, or melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, and where the humours do most abound; and then what simples are best to purge those humors, and with what property, quality and temperament they bee indued; f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>r some simples are most violent, and next cousins to strong p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ysons, as <hi>Scamony,</hi> or <hi>Coloquin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tida</hi>: some againe are gentle, and rather nourishing then medicinall, as <hi>Manna, Cassia,</hi> whay, prunes, and such like: and some are neither too violent, nor too gentle, but of a meane, as <hi>Rewbarbe, Agaricke, Sene,</hi> &amp; <hi>Aloes.</hi> Now the ancient Farriers did vse to purge their horses with the pulpe of <hi>Coloquintida,</hi> somtimes with the rootes of wild cowcumbers, and sometimes with the broth of a sodden whelpe mixt with <hi>Nitrum,</hi> and such like; but at this day they are not of our practise, and therefore I wish him that for his experience will make a tryall of strong medicines, or know the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings of euery seuerall simple (which is a most praise-worthy ambition,) first, to make his proofes vpon iades whose losse he respecteth not, and so by that working to aduenture on better horses. But to return to my purpose, the Farrier who goeth about to purge a horse by purgation, must consider the nature of the horses disease, and the strength of the horse, and with them ioyne the nature, strength, and quantity of the medicine; he must also consider the climate vnder which the horse is bred, the time of the disease, the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:26941:93"/>
time of the yeare, and the time of the day: for as the diseases, and the humours which cause the diseases, are sundry, so they must be auoyded by sundry medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, sundry wayes compounded, according as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience from a continuall practise shall instruct you; wherein you are to obserue, that weake, delicate, and tender horses are not to be purged with that violence which strong, stubborne, and sturdy horses are; and therefore in such cases, the quality and quantity is to be looked into of euery simple. The climate is to be respected, as whether it be hot or cold; and the time of the disease: for some diseases must be purged at the beginning, as feuers, pestilence, yellowes, staggers, &amp; all violent inward diseases; and some not till the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be throughly disgested, as colds, strangles, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postumations. Now albeit the sicknesse proceed from cold humours, yet you must not administer as hot simples in summer as in winter, nor in the contrary case, so cold things in winter as in the summer; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you see the season of the yeare is to be respected. Then touching respect of the day, you are to obserue that day to be best which is most temperate, sith too much heate maketh a horse faint, and too much cold doth hinder the medicine from working. A little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard is to be had to the wind &amp; weather: for a moyst day with a South winde, is to be preferred before a North winde with a dry day. Now the best howre of receiuing any potion, is euer in the morning after he hath fasted from meate and drinke all the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. As soone as your horse hath receiued any pill or potion, let him be walked or gently ridden vp and downe one howre at the least; and then set vp, and suffered to stand on the bit two howres after, wel litte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:26941:94"/>
cloathed and stopped; but if you perceiue that he beginneth to grow sicke (as most commonly horses will) then you shall suffer him to lye downe, &amp; assoone as his sicknesse is past, you shall offer him a mashe of malt and water luke warme: for any other meate keep him fasting till his medicine haue done working.</p>
                     <p>Now to come to particular receipts and medicines themselues, you shall vnderstand that although the ancient Farriers do make but two kindes, that is to say, pils and purgations, yet I diuide them into three, that is to say, scourings, pils, and purgations. Scou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings are those wholesome naturall and gentle pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging medicines, which stirring vp no great fluxe of humours, do onely keepe the body cleane from such euils as would grow, being euery way as wholesome in health as in sicknesse, and may most properly be termed preparatiues or preparers of the body to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine more stronger medicines. To speake then first of the most gentlest and naturall scouring, it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grasse being giuen to a horse only fifteene dayes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and no more; for after that it fatteth and not scoureth. Next vnto grasse is forrage, which is onely the blades of greene corne, as wheat, rye, barley, and such like, being giuen seuen dayes and no more. Next is greene thistles, being cut vp, and giuen the horse to eate the space of fiue daies and no more: and the last of this nature is the mash made in this manner: take a pecke of ground malt, and put it into a peale, then take a gallon and a halfe of water boyling hot from the fire, and put it to the malt: then with a staffe mash and stirre them together at least halfe an howre, till tasting the water you feele it as sweete as hony, then being luke warme, giue it the horse to drinke. All
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:26941:94"/>
these scourings do onely but cleanse the guts and coole the body, adding comfort to the spirits, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendring strength, onely the mash is to be vsed after labour, or in stead of drinke in the time of any great sicknesse. Scourings of a little stronger nature are these: first, when you giue your horse any prouender, to mixe with halfe a pecke of oates, a handfull or two of cleane drest hemp seede: or else to take a good quantity of boxe leaues, and put them into a pewter dish, then set them before the fire, and let them dry leasurely till they be so hard that you may crush them to powder; then take as much of the powder of brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone as there is powder of boxe, and mixe them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and amongst halfe a pecke of oates mixe a handfull of this powder, and giue it the horse to eate; both these scourings are to be vsed after labour, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when the horse hath sweat much. These two scourings worke vpon no matter but what nature is willing to expell, they purge the stomacke, head, and intrailes, they kill all manner of wormes, and dry vp fleame. Scourings of the strongest nature, are to take of sallet oyle halfe a pint, and of new milke from the cow a pint, brew it together, and giue it the horse luke warme: or else take a pint of muskadine, and halfe a pint of sallet oyle, and being mixed together, giue it the horse to drinke: or else halfe a pint of oyle, and a pint of sacke mixt together, and giuen the horse to drinke luke warme. These scourings cleanse the head, body, and guts, of all fleame or molten grease, which any violent labour hath dissolued: they are exceeding good for any manner of cold or stoppings in the winde-pipes. Now for pils, you shall vnderstand that the first and easiest are these, either to take twenty
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:26941:95"/>
cloues of garlike cleane pild and bruised, then a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a pound of sweete butter; and so rolle vp the garlicke in foure or fiue balles or pellets, as big as two wal-nuts a peece: and so taking out the horses tongue thrust them downe his throate one after another; or else to take a quarter of a pound of butter, and as much red saunders; beat them well together in a morter, &amp; then make it into foure or fiue balles, and put them downe the horses throat. Pils of a somewhat stronger nature, are to take a handfull of rosemary leaues, and chopping them small, mixe them with a quarter of a pound of sweet butter; and then making it into round bals, giue them vnto the horse: or else take round pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of raw mellons, and thrust them downe the horses throate: or else to take fiue greene figges, and put them downe the horses throate. The strongest pill is this: take of lard two pound, layd in water 2 howres, then take nothing but a quarter of a pound of the cleane fat thereof, and stampe it in a mortar, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to put of licoras, of anise seedes, and of fenugreeke, of each beaten into powder, one ounce and a halfe; of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loes likewise in powder one ounce, of <hi>Agaricke</hi> halfe an ounce; knead all these together like paste, and make thereof foure or fiue balles, and giue it to the horse. This last recited pill is singular good for the dry cough, and all the other pils are most soueraigne for all infirmities of the head, which grow either from fleame, melancholy, or any other cold or moist cause whatsoever. Now for purgations which are the strongest cleansers of the body, they be these: Take two ounces of <hi>Myrre,</hi> and mixe it with a pint of wine, and it wil purge all sicknesse which proceedeth of cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler: the signes whereof are, his belly will swell, be
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:26941:95"/>
very hot, and he can neither dung nor breake winde. Take a pint of wine, and beate a raw egge therein, and adde to it a quarter of an ounce of brimstone, &amp; halfe an ounce of <hi>Myrre</hi> beaten to powder, and giue it the horse luke warme, and it will purge all inward diseases proceeding of melancholy. Two spoonefull of the powder <hi>Diapente,</hi> giuen with halfe a pint of swines grease, purgeth all diseases proceeding of fleame. Take as much blacke sope as a wal-nut, a quart of new milke, and a quarter of a pint of sallet oyle, and giue it the horse luke warme, and it purgeth all cold infirmities. Take the guts of a Tench or Barbell, being cut into little small peeces, and giue it the horse in a quart of white wine, and it will purge the horse from all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiuenesse or paine in the guts. Rye being boyled, so that it burst not, then dryed againe, and giuen the horse in stead of prouender, purgeth and killeth all manner of wormes. Take of radish rootes one ounce, of the roote called <hi>Panax,</hi> and of <hi>Scamony,</hi> of each halfe an ounce; beate all these together, and boyle them in a quart of hony, then giue the horse two spoonefull of this in a quart of ale luke warme to drinke, and it will purge all grosse humours, from whence proceedeth either the falling euill or any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease of the braine. Take and boyle <hi>Elicampanam</hi> roots in milke till they be so soft that you may bruise them to pappe, and then adding thereto halfe a pint of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let oyle, giue it the horse to drinke luke warme, and this will purge and cleanse any glaunders. Take of sweete sope a quarter of a pound, and make it into three balles, and giue them to the horse, &amp; it wil purge all euill humors whatsoeuer, both violently and most aboundantly.</p>

                     <p>THere is also another maner of purging of a horse, and especially his head, and that is, by forcing him to neese or snurt violently at his nose, casting forth all filthy and grosse matter, which otherwise would offend and oppresse the braine; and this neesing is wrought sometimes by fumes or smoakes, sometimes by powders, and sometimes by oyles; the sharpnesse of which tickling the tender and quicke parts of the head, do compell this snurting and neesing: surely there is no purgation more wholesome, for as it clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth and separateth grosse matter, so it comforteth and maketh strong the braine. Now to come vnto the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular medicines which do procure this neesing, they be these: Squirt into an horses nosthrels, either mans vrine which is old, or the vrine of an oxe which hath had much rest, and it will force a horse to neese, and is most wholesome for any quotidian feuer. Take the powder of gumdragant, Ensens, and damaske roses, well mixt together, and blow it with a quill into the horses nosthrels, and it is good either against the feuer in sommer or winter. Take warme vinegar and squirt it into his nosthrels, &amp; it is comfortable against the feuer which cometh by raw disgestion. Take of garlick stalkes a handfull, being broke into little pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and a good quantity of frankinsence, and being put vpon a chasing dish and coles, hold the chasing dish vnder the horses nosthrels, so that the fume may ascend vp into his head; and this is most excellent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:26941:96"/>
the head-ache. Take feathers and brimstone, &amp; burne them on a chafing dish and coales vnder the horses nose; or blow pepper and <hi>Perithre</hi> beaten to powder vp into his nosthrels; either of both these are most excellent against the sleeping euill. Take the powder of motherwort, and blow it vp into a horses nostrels, and it is good against the falling euill. Take two goose feathers annoynted ouer with oyle de bay, and thrust them vp and downe in the horses no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sthrels: or else to take sage, penyriall, and wheate, long sodden together, and put into a bagge as hot as may be, which bagge would be so close fastned to the horses head, that all the smoake and sauour thereof may ascend vp into his nosthrels: or take a clout an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted with sope or oyle de bay, and rub it vp and downe his nosthrels as high as may be. Any of all these, or all these together, are most excellent against any cold, poze, or other obstruction in the head. Take orpiment and sulphure, and burn them on the coales, and hold it vnder the horses nose: or take oyle de bay, <hi>Euforbium,</hi> and white <hi>Ellebore,</hi> and annointing two fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers therewith, thrust them vp into the horses no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sthrels; both these are good against the glaunders. Take of the stalkes of bryony or wilde vine, two hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls, and bruise them betwixt two stones, and being so bruised, put them into a linnen bagge, and fasten the bagge so to the horses head, that the sent may go vp into his nosthrels without touching the hearbe with his mouth: and this is excellent against the mourning of the chine, or any inward cough. Take of rosemary, of narde, and of sage, dryed and beaten in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fine powder, or each like waight, and with a quill blow them vp into the horses nosthrels: or take the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:26941:97"/>
powder of white pepper, or of <hi>Sal-niter,</hi> or of <hi>Iris Ili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> or blacke <hi>Eleboris,</hi> and blow them with a quill vp into the horses nosthrels: or take linnen cloth dipt in the dregs of oyle; &amp; setting it on fire, then suddenly put it out againe, and let the smoake ascend vp into the horses nosthrels: or squirt into his nosthrels <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolochia</hi> mixt with wine: or <hi>Sal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>FRictions or Bathes, are a certaine rubbing, annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or bathing of a horses body all ouer, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against the haire, because the medicine may sinke in so much the better with comfortable and soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne vnguents, whose vertues do loosen the skinne, cheare vp the inward spirits, and spread a liuely heate and feeling ouer the whole body: and of frictions, both according to the opinion of the old Farriers, &amp; also all the best of this present age, these are the most soueraigne. Take of damaske roses one pound, of old oyle a pint, of strong vinegar a pint and an halfe, of mints and rew, beaten into powder, of each one ounce and a halfe, together with one old dry nut; beate them, and mingle them well together: then
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:26941:97"/>
being strained and made luke warme, if it be in the sommertime, and that the Sunne shine hot, take the horse abroad; but if otherwise, keepe him in the stable, and heating a barre of yron exceeding hot, hold it ouer and on each side the horse, and with the oyntment, rubbe and chafe the horse all ouer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the haire, vntill the horse beginne to sweate; then cloathe the horse very warme, and let him stand. This friction is excellent against all winter feuers, or any inward sicknesse that cometh of cold. Take of blacke <hi>Elleborus</hi> two or three handfuls, and boyle it in a sufficient quantity of strong vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar; and with that rubbe and chafe all the horses head and body quite ouer once or twice a day; and it is most excellent against frenzy, madnesse, or any drynesse or scallynesse of the skinne. Take oyle de bay, or <hi>Dialthea,</hi> and annoynt all the horses body all ouer therewith, holding a panne of coales, or a hot panne of coales neare the oyntment to make it sinke in; or else make him a bathe of running water, wherein is boyled rew, wormewood, sage, Iuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, bay leaues, and hyssope, and bathe all his body therewith: either of these are most soueraigne for the mourning of the chine, or any disease of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, lungs, or spleene. Take wine and oyle, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing mixt them together, chafe and rubbe the horses body therewith, and it is most soueraigne for any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward sicknesse especially of the liuer. To bathe a horse in salt water is very wholesome, both for the horses skinne, and also for any disease of the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke.

out the curd, and cast it away; then straine the whay through a course cloath into a cleane vessell, then take a quarter of a pecke of cleane husked oates that were neuer dryed, and put them into the whay, and set them on the fire till the oates burst, and be soft; then take them off, and powre them into a collander that is full of holes, so that the whay may goe gently from them without any pressing (for you must keepe the oats as moist as may be:) this done put the oats into a frying pan, and set them ouer the fire; stirring them continually till you see the vapour or smoake of them not ascend vpwards, but as it were runne about the pan; then suddenly take them off, and putting them into a presse, presse them most exceedingly, and looke what cometh fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, is only the oile of them, which you must saue in a close glasse.

                     <head>CHAP. 100. Certaine briefe Obseruations to be obserued at home and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad whilst the horse is in health.</head>
                     <p>THese obseruations following are gathered from the most exact principles, and vnfallible grounds of all the best and surest approued horsemen, either of this kingdome, or of any other nation within Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome. First then for the generall feeding of your horse, when he is in health you shall feed him with straw, hay, oates, fine little wheat, beanes, barly, bread made of beanes, pease, or fitches, or any other meate that swels not in the horses body.</p>
                     <p>It is the opinion of <hi>Camerarius</hi> first to giue prouen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, then hay, and lastly water; but our English cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome is, first hay, then water, and lastly prouender.</p>
                     <p>In your trauell feed your horse betimes for all night, that thereby the horse may sooner take his rest.</p>
                     <p>The quantity of prouender which you shall giue your horse at one time, shall be as much as you can hold in the palmes of both your hands at sixe times.</p>
                     <p>Horsebread which is made of cleane beanes, cleane pease, or cleane fitches feedeth exceedingly.</p>
                     <p>Let your horses meate and drinke be exceeding sweete and cleane, yet his water by no meanes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme cold running water from the rocke; for it pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth to much.</p>
                     <p>To rubbe your horses mouth with salte and wine, will make him both eate and drinke with a much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:26941:101"/>
appetite.</p>
                     <p>Let your horse neither eate when he is hot, nor drinke when he is hot, neither presently after his tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell.</p>
                     <p>Labour your horse moderately when the weather is either extreme hot or extreme cold, that so you may auoide extreme heats or suddaine colds.</p>
                     <p>Trauell not your horse too late, that your owne eye may see him well dried and well fed before you take your owne rest.</p>
                     <p>Neuer take the saddle from your horses backe sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly.</p>
                     <p>Lend not your horse, least your selfe walke on foot.</p>
                     <p>Let your horse lye cleane and dry, keepe your stable sweete, let no swine lye neere it, nor let any pullen come whithin it.</p>
                     <p>Let your horse euer be tyed with two reines.</p>
                     <p>Let the light of your stable be euer towards South and North, yet so as the North windowes may in the winter be shut vp close at pleasure, and opened in the sommer to giue fresh aire,</p>
                     <p>Ride your horse oft a little on stony waies, that he may the better feele his feete, and harden his houes.</p>
                     <p>Haue euer neere your stable some close plaine greene, that your horse being let loose, he may oft tumble himselfe thereon.</p>
                     <p>Let your horses bed be of soft sweete straw some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what aboue his knees, of which rie straw is the best; for though barley straw be the softest, yet a horse wil couet to eate it, and it is vnwholesome; and wheat straw though it be not vnwholsome to eate, yet it is hard to lye vpon: as for oate straw it is the best in the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:26941:101"/>
superlatiue; for it is both wholsome to eate, and soft to lye vpon.</p>
                     <p>Curry or dresse your horse twise a day before water, and when he is curried, rubbe him with your hand and with a rubber; his head would be rubbed with a wet cloth, and his coddes made cleane with a dry cloth; his foretop, his maine, and his taile, would be oft wet with a wet maine combe, and euer where the horses haire is thinnest there curry the gentlest.</p>
                     <p>Let the plaunchers of your stable lye euen and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, that your horse may stand at his ease, and not proue lame, by too much oppressing his hinder partes.</p>
                     <p>Let not any mud wal be within your horses reach; for he will naturally couet to eate of it, and nothing is more vnwholesome.</p>
                     <p>Giue your horse plenty of garbadge (which is chopt wheat straw) both with his prouender, and without.</p>
                     <p>Let your hay bottles be very little, and tyed very hard: for so your horse shall eate with the best sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, and make least waste.</p>
                     <p>To sprinkle water vpon your hay, is most whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, and to sprinkle fenugreeke vpon your prouen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, is as soueraigne; the first is good for the winde, the latter for wormes.</p>
                     <p>Giue your horse dayly exercise: for that gets the best stomacke to his meate.</p>
                     <p>Purge your horse once a yeare with grasse, or with greene blades of corne, called forrage, for fifteene daies together; yet before you so purge him, in any case let him bloud, and whilest he is in purging, by no meanes let him haue any prouender.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="198" facs="tcp:26941:102"/>A horse after trauell hath euer more bloud then any beast whatsoeuer.</p>
                     <p>Greene grasse or forrage cleanseth the bloud, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth strength, healeth diseases, auoydeth melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, helpeth the horses growth, and maketh the skin smooth; whilest the horse is at soile, by no meanes let him take cold.</p>
                     <p>The Northerne man watereth two howres before he rideth at the least: then lets the horse eate a little hay, then giues prouender, but not much, and bridleth the horse vp a quarter of an howre before he rideth: at night he watereth two miles before he taketh his lodging, then rideth easily; he neither walketh his horse, nor stuffeth him, nor looseth any gyrth, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rubbeth him very cleane, &amp; so lets him bite vpon his bridle halfe an howre after, with good store of litter vnder him; then he giues the horse hay, and after pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uender; before he goeth to bed, he watereth againe, (yet but a little) then sees the horse throughly well drest and rubbed, well littered, and most sufficiently meated.</p>
                     <p>There be others which walke after labour, then rubbes well, littereth and vnbridleth; both which be good, so that the one haue not too much walking, nor the other too cold a stable. But howsoeuer, stuffe not your horse backward, but betwixt his forelegges, and formost gyrth: for backward stuffing is perillous, lest drawing his yard when he would stale, he draw backe into his sheath any of the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that stoppes him. The Northerne mans vse agreeth with the French principles, which saith, Vse no other walking then yourselfe on your horses back, by riding him gently till you come to your Inne;
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:26941:102"/>
and so make him cold; then shake litter vnder him, rub his legges, his belly, and euery parte of his body well till he be dry, then vnbridle him, rub his head wel, and giue him hay; slacke no girth till it be night that the windowes be shut, suffer the horse to drinke but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle at once to auoyd suddaine cooling of the stomacke, or driuing the horse into a shaking feuer: at night rub and curry well, and feede according to the horses sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke.</p>
                     <p>Other good horsemen ride gently till the horses sinewes be chafed, and neuer water in trauell till the horse haue staled, and forbeare to trauell him fast be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he haue drunke, that he may not drinke in his great heat, and they hold the standing water the best; after water for a mile they ride softly till his water be warmed in his belly, and before they come to their Inne they do not water, nor of an howre after they haue vnbridled; then they clothe well, and giue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uender, hauing a care that their horses stand not in the wind, and that they haue ben rubbed dry and cleane. Now all these principles are exceeding good; yet I would wish euery traueller to learne how his horse hath beene vsed, and that custome (if it be not too much against reason) still to follow.</p>
                     <p>If you come late to your Inne, and that your iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney be greate and hasty, so that your horse will not eate till he haue drunke, and yet is hote notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, then let his drinke be milke giuen in the darke, lest the whitenesse make him refuse it; this is both cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diall and pleasant: if you cannot get milke enough, then mingle milke with water luke warme, for no drinke would be giuen to a horse hotter.</p>
                     <p>If your horse either by labour or surfaits be brought
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:26941:103"/>
low, leane, and weake, you shall giue him mates milke to drinke many daies together, and it will make him strong.</p>
                     <p>It is not good to wash your horse, if he be either very hot or very fat; otherwise you may wash his legges aboue the knees, so that in no case you wash his belly, and that you ride him a good round pace after his washing; then by no meanes walke him, but set him vp and dresse him: the purer the water is where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you wash your horse, the more wholesome it is, so that it be not too extreme cold.</p>
                     <p>The best howres to water your horse in (when he liues at rest) is betwixt seauen and eight in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and foure and fiue in the euening.</p>
                     <p>When you trauell, at euery steepe hill light, both to refresh your horse and your selfe.</p>
                     <p>Let a fat or hot horse haue his water at foure times, and not as much as he will drinke at once; giue him prouender twise at night, &amp; but once in the morning; let his cloth neither be too hot, nor with straw too much stuffed; when he eateh good hay, let him haue lesse prouender then when he eateth straw: giue his meate by a little at once to auoyd glutting of him, and let him stand two howers euery day without meate.</p>
                     <p>Rubbing much, hard, and well, doth profite, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue, and doth keepe both strength of body and legges: for in rubbing and combing, a horse doth take much delight, and it is better then much meate.</p>
                     <p>To feede with barley (according to the opinion of the ancient Italians) ingendreth good bloud, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth strength and courage, and maintaineth health; but with vs here in England, we finde oates to be a much better feeding.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="201" facs="tcp:26941:103"/>In the dogge daies it is not wholesome to ride your horse oft into the water, to allay his naturall heate.</p>
                     <p>The maisters eye to see his horse well curried, and with the hand well rubbed, and well meated, and the stable sweete and cleane kept, preserueth health, and wonderfully feedeth the horse.</p>
                     <p>Cleanse and picke the soales and bottoms of your horses feet oft, and stuffe them with Oxe dung, and annoynt his houes with fresh grease, tarre, or Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine.</p>
                     <p>Much rest is the mother of many diseases.</p>
                     <p>When you ride, looke often to your saddle &amp; your horses shooes, and you shall finde much more ease in your iourney.</p>

                     <p>The Greeke horse (which we call the Turky horse) is a most excellent horse, swift, bold, well headed, tall and strong, many of them be white, some bay, some sorrell, and some blacke.</p>

all lenity and gentlenesse, and not with beating.</p>

                     <p>The Flemish horse is better then the Freesland.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Spanish Ienet</hi> is good, swift, and light.</p>

                     <p>To get horse colts, couer before the full of the moone; and to get mare colts couer after the full.</p>
                     <p>To make a mare stand to her horsing, set her by the horse two or three dayes, that he may much desire &amp; be acquainted before he couer her: after bring them out, and let him serue her, and haue ready a pale of water, which when the horse shrinketh from her, powre vpon the ridge of the mares backe; then set them so farre asunder as that the one may not heare the other: do this three mornings &amp; three euenings together, then let her not come neare the horse after, till she be knit, lest the desire of him againe, make her to shoot out that which he kept before.</p>
                     <p>To know whether your mare be with foale about Christmas or no, powre a little water into her eare, and if she onely shake her head, she is then with foale, both if she shake both head and body also, she is not with foale.</p>

                     <p>Put your mares to the horse from midde March till midde May or midde Iune, the moone hauing newly changed.</p>
                     <p>It is good to put the horse and the mare for three or foure nights together in some vast empty house, and in the morning take the horse away and feede him well; but feede your mare sparingly, especially giue her little water.</p>
                     <p>At the end of sixe moneths, by no meanes chafe your mares: for then they are in quickning, and may easily be made to cast their foales.</p>

Let him runne at the halters end: for if he be lame, (hauing that liberty) he will fauour that legge which is amisse, and leane vpon it. If he turne vp the white of his eye, or lay his eare to his necke when he is ridden, he is a sullen iade, and full of naughty qualities; if when you stirre him in the stable, he stare and looke backe vpon you with a stout countenance, it is a token of a good stomacke in him, and great aptnesse to be taught; if he stirre the end of his taile as he passeth out and is ridden, and yet doth not whiske it, it sheweth that his pace is vnperfect; be sure to see him turne as short as may be, that you may know whether he be swayed in the backe or no, the middle stature is the best, and the short knit horse is the strongest. The wall eye euer seeth the worst. The horse that is of nature gentle, swift, light, nimble, of easie pace, good co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, strong feete, good loynes, speedy in eating, and good at his prouender, is euer the best for vse, and the readiest money in the market.

                     <p>IT is most necessary that euery carefull Farrier know all the principall veines in a horses body, especially those which in the time of neede, or in sicknesse, are to be opened<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore to begin you shall know that from the liuer which is the fountaine of bloud, both in man and beasts, doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise one maine great conduit or large veine, which as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending into the body, doth diuide it selfe into thus many seuerall branches or lesser riuers. First, within the palate of the mouth, aboue the first and third barres, are two notable veines which the best Farri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers do touch or strike when the horse hath any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease in his head, braine, or stomacke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he hath also o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two which descend down from the lower part of his eies vnto his nosthrels, &amp; are euer opened for any griefe in the eies: he hath two others which are aboue his eies, and run crosse the temples of his head, &amp; are called the temple veines, which are likewise opened for all maner of cold diseases in the head; he hath also
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:26941:110"/>
two great maine veines running alongst each side of his wind-pipe, euen from the vppermost ioint of his neather chap downe to the breast, which are called the necke veines; and are those which are ordinarily o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened for any disease whatsoeuer. He hath then two veines which arise vpward from betweene his forelegs to the top of his breast, &amp; are called the breast veines; &amp; they are opened when the horse hath any feuer, or is sicke at the heart. He hath other two which likewise ascend from betweene the forelegs, but do not mount so high as the breast veines, but rest vpon the formost bought of the forelegge: and they be called the palate veines, and they be opened either for foundring, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther griefe in the limbs. He hath other 2 veines which run downe from the elbow of the foreshoulder, down all along the inside of the forelegs, and are called the shanke veines, which are opened for splents, mallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, or such like. He hath then foure veins which run alongst the fetlocks of the horse, &amp; are called the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kell veines; which albeit they are but smal, yet they are many times opened for stiffnesse in the ioints, or for ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring: then he hath foure veines about the cronets of his hoofes, &amp; are called the cronet veins, and are ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for foundring in the feet, or for ring-bones: then he hath foure veines within his foure hoofes, running about his toes, &amp; are called the feet veins, and are only opened for foundring or frettizing in the feet: he hath then two maine great veines which descend downe from his stones alongst the inside of his thighes to his cambrell; &amp; are called the kidney veines, which only are opened for diseases in the kidneies: he hath then two other veines which descend from aboue the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der cambrel, all alongst the inside of the hinder legges

Lastly, he hath one single veine in his taile, which is called the taile veine, &amp; is opened for the shedding of the haire or any manginesse. So there is in a horses bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of principall veines which vpon occasion must be opened, iust 37. as you may perceiue by this figure, which is the true anatomy of all the principall veins &amp; others within a horses body; where you are to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that the letter <hi>A</hi> sheweth the temple veine, <hi>B</hi> the eie veine, <hi>C</hi> the palate veines, <hi>D</hi> the necke veine, <hi>E</hi> the breast veine, <hi>F</hi> the plat veines, <hi>G</hi> the shank veins, <hi>H</hi> the cronet veines, <hi>I</hi> the hoofe veines, <hi>K</hi> the spurre veins, <hi>L</hi> the kidney veines, <hi>M</hi> the spauen veines, <hi>N</hi> the flanke veines, <hi>O</hi> the hanch veines, <hi>P</hi> the taile veine, &amp; <hi>Q</hi> the fet-locke veines. Now for the other small threeds, or veines, which as it were, ouerspread the whole body, because nature will allow no part or member to be empty or void of bloud, they be also veines, deriued from the other maine great veines, yet of no efficacy or force, but such as vpon any necessary incision may very well be cut asunder without any fluxe of bloud, or other danger; but for the other maister veins, they may not be cut but with great perill.

                     <head>CHAP. 5. How and when a Horse should be let bloud, the end whereof, and the signes of the necessity.</head>
                     <p>THe ancient Farriers, and those of these present times, are at great difference touching the letting of a horse bloud: for some would haue him let bloud foure times in the yeare, that is to say, in the spring, in sommer, in Autumne and in winter. Others would haue him onely let bloud three times in the yeare, namely in May when he is turned to grasse; because then the bloud beginneth to encrease: secondly in September, that blond if it be inflamed may then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euacuate and breathe forth: and thirdly in Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:26941:114"/>
to let go the grosse and knotty bloud which is bred by labor or careles keeping. Others would haue a horse to be let bloud but once in the yeare, namely in the beginning of May onely when he is to be put to grasse, alledging this reason, that if the horse be not let bloud in the spring, the new bloud being mixt with the old corrupt bloud, wil be apt to be inflamed, and so draw vpon the horse some grieuous sicknes. Others would haue the horse to be let bloud in the necke veine not aboue once in the yeare, namely at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of May; but in the palate of the mouth they would haue him let bloud at the least once euery mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, alledging that it wil cleare the sight, comfort the braine, &amp; giue him good appetite to his meate; but to conclude, there is not any of these opinions, but are sound &amp; good, so the horse be yong &amp; in strength, his bloud encreasing, but if he be old &amp; his bloud in the eb, then you cannot let bloud too seldome. Now that it is fit a yong horse should be let bloud, is proued by the daily experience of the <hi>Polander</hi> horses, who being at liberty out of a naturall instinct in themselues, faile not once a yeare to let themselues bloud; yet we haue diuers of our best Farriers who would not haue a horse let bloud before there be vrgent necessity, lest the vse of letting bloud bring a horse to an euill cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, and draw on sicknesse vnexpected; but with that opinion I cannot agree, because I hold it more vertue to preuent a danger before it come, then to driue it away being present. Now that oft letting of bloud breedeth in a horse weaknesse, and maketh the bloud to resort to the inward parts, cloying the heart &amp; intrails, &amp; making the outward parts fat &amp; vnwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, there is no question but that the letting a horse

bloud twice in the yeare, namely at the beginning of May, &amp; the end of December (at which times onely I would haue a horse let bloud &amp; no other) should be accounted oft, I see no reason. Now for stallions, the ancient Farriers would by no meanes haue them let bloud, because, say they, the couering of mares is as great an expence of bloud as may be, affirming that one ounce of seed doth counteruaile fiue ounces of bloud, &amp; truly I am of that opinion to; but whereas they likwise aduise by no means to let geldings bloud, because the losse of their stones is the losse of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall heat; to that I am much contrary, because I haue found it by continuall experience, that geldings do as oft dy through the corruption &amp; abundance of bloud as horses; nay &amp; much more ofter, in as much as they want the helpes which horses haue for purging their blouds from vncleannesse. Now in the leting of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses bloud, euery carefull Farrier is first to respect the climate vnder which the horse is bred, knowing that those horses which are bred in cold countries, haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer more bloud then those which are bred in the hot; then he must consider the time of the yeare, which would euer be the spring, or the fall of the leafe, both those times being most temperat, neither exceeding in heate nor in cold. Next he must regard the time of the day, which would euer be in the morning fasting, so it be not at the horses awaking from sleepe, but at least an houre or two after: then he must look vnto the state of the moone, that the signe be not in that part of the body where he intendeth to let bloud: next he must looke to the horses age, for if he be yong &amp; not come to his growth, it will hinder his waxing; &amp; if he be old and come to decrepidnes, his bloud had more
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:26941:115"/>
neede be repaired then wasted. Lastly he shall looke to the horses strength and ancient custome, and so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he shall deale with him, obseruing that some horses may better spare two or three pound of bloud then other some one pound. Now thus much I haue spoken touching ordinary &amp; natural letting of bloud without compulsion of any sicknesse or disease; but in case where sicknesse or infirmity craueth this office of letting bloud, there you shall neither respect climate, season of the yeare, time of the day, signe, age, strength nor custome, but setting all aside, apply your selfe onely to the remouing of the infirmity. Now the signes to know if a horse stand in neede to be let bloud, are these: his eyes will looke redde, and his veines will swell more then ordinary; also hee will haue a certaine itch about his maine and his taile, and will be continually rubbing them, and sometimes wil shed some of his haire also; he will now and then pill about the roots of his eares, or in those places where the head-stale of the bridle lies: his vrine will be red and high coloured, and his dung will be blacke and hard: also if he hath redde inflammations, or little bubbles on his backe, or doth not disgest his meate well, it is a signe the horse would be let bloud: or if he haue any apparant signe of yellowes in the whites of his eyes, or in the inside of his lippes, either vpper or nether<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is a signe he would be let bloud: for after any of these signes doth most commonly follow some one or other grieuous sicknes, which to preuent is the true art of a skilfull Farrier Now it is meete that when you intend to let a horse bloud (hauing leasure to do the same) that you suffer him to be thinly dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etted a day or two before he be let bloud, to the end
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:26941:115"/>
that his body may be quiet &amp; not troubled with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion. Now for the maner of letting a horse bloud, you shall as neare as you can, let him stand vpon euen ground, &amp; if it be the necke veine which you would strike, you shall take a small long cord with a noose, and putting it ouer the horses necke, as close to the setting on of the shoulder as you can, there draw it a straite as is possible, and then fasten it with a run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning knot, and straight you shall see the veines to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare as bigge as a mans little finger, euen from the nether chap down the neck. Now you are to obserue that the place where you are to strike the veine in, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer within 3 fingers or 4 fingers at the most, of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chap; as thus, if your horse haue a long, fine, thin necke and skin, then you may strike the veine within three fingers or lesse of the chap (sith the higher is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the better;) but if he haue a short chub neck, with a thicke skin, and many wreathes, or rolles, about the setting on of his chaps, then you shall strike the veine at least foure fingers from the chap, lest those wreaths together with the thicknesse of the skinne, do so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the veine that your fleame cannot reach it. When you haue thus raised the veine vp, you shall cause one to stand on the contrary side the horse, and with his fist to thrust the veine forth hard against you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then you shall either with a wette sponge, or with a little spettle, wette that part of the veine which you meane to strike, and then separating the haire, set your fleame euen and directly vpon the veine; and then with a good smart blow, strike it into the veine: which done, you shall cause one to put his finger into the horses mouth, and tickling him in the roofe thereof, make him chaw and moue his
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:26941:116"/>
chappes, for that will force the bloud to spinne forth. Now the bloud which you take from the horse, it is very necessary that you saue in diuers vessels for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers causes, as first, that you may see when all the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt bloud is come forth, and that when the colour thereof is growne pure, and so remaineth being cold, that then you suffer the horse to bleed no more; or else that you saue it to bath the horses body therwith; which is most wholsome: or else to make a medicine therewithall by mingling with the bloud vinegar and oyle, and so bathe the horses body therewith, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally that place which was let bloud; for the ancient Farriers hold an opinion that it is indued with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine naturall vertue and power to comfort the weake and feeble members of a horse, and to dry vp all euill humors. Now as soone as your horse hath bled suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently, you shall let loose the cord, &amp; immediatly the veine will stoppe; then with that cord you shal stroake down the veine iust ouer the orrefire twise or thrice, which wil both close vp the hole &amp; also turn the course of the bloud this done set the horse vp in the stable, &amp; let him stand fasting 2. or 3. howres after, and then after diet him according as in your discretion you shall thinke meete, that is to say, if he be a sicke horse, then like a sicke horse with good prouender &amp; warme mashes; but if he be a sound horse, then like a sound horse, either turne him to grasse, or keep him in the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble after his ancient custome. Now if you would let your horse bloud either in the temple veins or the eie veins, you shal then cord him hard about the midst of the necke, and not neare his shoulders, hauing care that you touch not his wind-pipe, &amp; so throttell him: for it wil make both those veines shew most apparant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:26941:116"/>
If you intend to let the horse bloud in the breast veines or plat veines, of some called the fore-thigh veines, you shall then cord him behind the shoulders close to the elbowes of the horse, and ouerthwart his withers, &amp; that will make those two veines shew. Now you shall vnderstand, that not any of these veins last spoken of, as about the head or the breast, must be let bloud by striking them with a fleame, (though it be the manner of our common Smithes) for it is most beastly &amp; butcherly, and also full of much danger by striking through the veine; but you shall with a fine sharpe lancet open the veine, euen in such sort as you see a skilfull Chirurgian open a veine in a mans arme. Now for the letting of a horse bloud in the palate of the mouth, you shall but onely with a sharpe pointed knife, pricke the horse betweene the second and third barre, as deepe as a barley corne is long, and he will bleede sufficiently: as for all other veines in a horses body whatsoeuer, which are to be opened, you shall vnderstand that whensoeuer it is needfull that they bleede, that then they must bee taken vp and not corded at all. Now touching the taking vp of veines, and the manner how to do it you shall reade more at large in a particular chapter to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of this booke.</p>

                     <p>OVtward sorrances, according to my meaning in this place, are taken two manner of waies, that is to say, either it is an euill state and composition of
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:26941:117"/>
the body, which is to be discerned either by the shape, number, quantity, or site of the member euil affected &amp; diseased: or else it is the loosning and diuision of an vnity, which as it may chance diuersly, so it hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers names accordingly. For if such a diuision or loosning be in the bone, then it is called a fracture: if it be in any fleshy part, then it is called a wound, or an vlcer: if it be in the veines, then a rupture; if in the sinewes, then a convultion or crampe; and if it be in the skinne, then it is called an excoriation: and of all these seuerally I intend to intreate in the following chapters. Now forasmuch as in this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall art of Surgery or Sorrances, there are certaine generall obseruations or caueats to be held inuio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, I will before I proceede any further, giue you a little taste thereof. First therefore, you shall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that it is the duty of euery good Farrier, neuer to burne or cauterize with hot Iron or with oyle, nor to make any incision with knife where there be either veines, sinewes, or ioints, but either somewhat lower, or somewhat higher.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Item,</hi> You shall neuer apply to any ioynt or finewie part, either <hi>Resalger, Arsnicke, Mercury sublimate,</hi> nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny such violent corrosiue.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Item,</hi> It is euer better to lance with a hot Iron then a cold, that is, it is better to cauterize then to incise.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Item,</hi> Bloud doth euer produce white and thicke matter; choler a waterish thin matter, but not much; salt fleame great abundance of matter: and melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly many dry scabs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Item,</hi> when you let bloud, you must take but the fouth part from a colt, which you take from a growne horse.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Item,</hi> You must neuer let bloud, except it be either
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:26941:117"/>
to diuert sicknesse and preserue health, or to refresh and coole the bloud, or else to diminish bloud, or to purge bad humours.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Item,</hi> In all impostumes or swelling soares, called <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors,</hi> you must obserue the 4 times of the sicknes, that is to say, the beginning of the griefe, the encrease of the griefe, the perfection and state of the griefe; and lastly, the declination and amending of the griefe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Item,</hi> In the beginning of euery such swelling apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stumes (if you cannot quite destroy them) vse reper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussiue medicines, if they be not neare some princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall part of the body; but then not, for feare of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangering life; in the augmentation, vse mollifying medicines, and supling to ripe them; and when they are ripe lance them, and let them out, or dry them vp; and in the declination of them, vse cleansing and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling medicines.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Item,</hi> All swellings are either hard or soft, the hard commonly will corrode, the soft will continue long.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Item,</hi> When soares begin to matter, then they heale, but if the putrifaction be great, then beware they rot not inwardly.</p>

and maketh them to runne and issue forth mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Item,</hi> You must sometimes burn vnder the soare, to diuert humors, and somtimes aboue, to defend and withhold humors.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Item,</hi> It is euer better to burne with copper then with yron, because yron is of a malignant nature; steele is of an indifferent vertue betwixt both.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Item,</hi> All actual burning is to burn with instrument, and potentiall burning is to burne with medicines, as are caustiks and corrosiues,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Item,</hi> If you vse oft to blow pouders into a horse eies, it will make him blind.</p>

Many other obseruations there are, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are not so generall as these be, and that I shall haue occasion to speake of them in other particular chapters, I thinke it here meete to omit them, and the rather because I will not be tedious.</p>

<pb n="321" facs="tcp:26941:118"/>
of outward causes, as heate, cold, or else by some stripe or blow.</p>
                     <p>And first to begin with the rheumaticke or watry eye, you shall vnderstand that according to the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the ancient Farriers, it doth proceed many times from the fluxe of humours distilling from the braine, and sometimes from the anguish of some blow or stripe receiued. The signes are, a continuall watering of the eye, and a close holding of the liddes together, accompanied sometimes with a little swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. The cure, according to the opinion of some Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers, is to take of <hi>Bole-armonicke,</hi> of <hi>Terra-sigillata,</hi> and of <hi>Sanguis Draconis,</hi> of each a like quantity; make them into powder, and then adde vnto them as much of the white of an egge and viniger, as will make them moist; and then spread it plaister-wise vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon a cloth, and lay it to the horses temples of his head aboue his eyes; and do this three daies together. Others vse to let the horse bloud in the veines vnder his eyes, then to wash the eye twice or thrice in the day with white wine, &amp; then to blow into the soare eye with a quill, the powder of <hi>Tartaz Salgam,</hi> and cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Other Farriers vse to take of pitch and rosen, and of masticke a like quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity; melt them together: then with a little sticke, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a clout bound to the end thereof, and dipt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, annoynt the temple veines on both sides a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full aboue the eyes, as broade as a twelue pence; and then clappe vnto it, immediatly a few flockes of like colour to the horse, holding them close to his head,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:26941:119"/>
with your hand, vntill they sticke fast to his head; then let him bloud on both his eye veines, if both eies be sore; and then wash his eies with white wine. Others vse onely to take a pretty quantity of life ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and to dissolue it in white wine, and to wash the horses eies therewith: and sure if it proceede from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny blow, it is a medicine sufficient inough; but if it proceede from any rheume or inward causes, then you shall take ground Iuy, beaten in a mortar, and mixt with waxe, and so laied to the eyes like a pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, or else boyle wormewood in white wine, and wash the horses eyes therewith: also to spurt beere orale now and then into the horses eyes, will cleare the sight passing well.</p>

                     <p>FOr any bloud-shotten eye, proceeding from any cause whatsoeuer, either outward or inward, you shall take (according to the opinion of the most an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Farrierss) of rose water, of <hi>Malmsey</hi> and of fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell water, of each three spoonefull; of <hi>Tutie</hi> as much as you may easily take vp betweene your thumbe and your finger; of cloues a dozen beaten in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fine powder; mingle them well together, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing luke warme, or cold, if you please, wash the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward puts of the eye with a feather dipt therein twise a day vntill the eye be well: or in stead hereof, to wash the eye either with the white of an egge, or with the iuyce of <hi>Selladine.</hi> Others vse to take the toppes of hawthornes, and boyling them in white wine, wash

But the best receipt that euer I found for this griefe, is to take take the whites of two egges, and beate it till it come to an oyle; then put to it two spoonefull of rose water, and three spoonefull of the iuice of housleeke; mixe them well together: then dippe therein little round plegants of flat cakes, of soft towe as bigge as a horses eye, and lay them vpon the horses eyes, renuing them as oft as they grow hard, and in a day or two it will make the horses eyes sound againe.</p>

Other Farriers vse to let the horse bloud in the eye veines, and then wash his eyes with red-rose water. Others vse to take the gall of a blacke sheepe, and beate it, and straine it; and then to wash the eyes therewith.

The signe is, the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant sight of the infirmity; and the cure, according to the opinion of the most ancient Farriers, is to take sixe leaues of ground Iuy, and a branch of selladine, and bray them in a mortar, with a spoonefull or two of womans milke; and then straine it through a cleane linnen cloth, and put it into a close glasse, and then droppe of it as much into the horses eye at a time, as will fill halfe a hazell nut shell: and it is the fittest to be done at night onely: do thus thrice at the least, and for three daies after, keepe the horse as much as may be, from any light. Other Farriers vse to annoint the horses eyes with the marrow of goates shankes, or Deeres shankes, and rose water mixt together; or else to wash his eyes with the iuice of the berries and leaues of ground Iuy, or other Iuy mixt with white wine; and to blow into his eyes the powder of blacke flint, or of land oysters; but that powder must be made so exceeding fine, as by art in scarcing can any waies be brought to passe. And then for the taking away of any filme or pearle, there is no medicine more soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne.

There be other Farriers which vse to take the leane of a gammon of bacon, &amp; dry it, &amp; therof make a powder, &amp; blow it into the horses eye. Others vse to take white ginger made into very fine powder, &amp; blow it into the horses eies; yet before you so do, if the web haue continued any long time, it shall not be amisse, first to annoint the horses eye with capons grease. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers vse to blow into the horses eye, the powder of elder leaues dryed, or else the powder of mans dung dryed, or the powder of a gray whetstone mixt with the oyle of hony, and put into the horses eie.

The cure is, first take a needle &amp; a double threed, put it through the tippe of the horses eare, which done, put the needle likewise through the vpper eye lid of the horse vpwards, and so draw vp the eye lidde, and fasten it to the eare, then with your thumbe

                     <p>THe moone eyes, or lunaticke eyes, are of all soare eyes the most dangerous and noysome, and do proceede from hot humours, descending from the head, and stirred vp by the extremity of ouer-riding, or compelling a horse to do more then nature will giue him leaue; as I haue seene a slothfull and heauy horse brought to be moone eyed by the folly of his rider, who would force him to stand, and trot contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the vigor of his spirit; so likewise I haue seene delicate mettald horses brought to be moone eyed, when their riders would not temper the freenesse of their natures, but haue giuen them leaue to runne into all violence. Now they be called moone eyes, because if the Farrier do obserue them, he shall perceiue that at some times of the moone, the horse will see very prettily, and at some times of the moone, he will see nothing at all. Now the signes hereof are, when the horses eyes are at the best, they will looke yellowish and dimme; and when they are at the worst, they will looke redde, fiery, and angry. The cure is to lay all ouer the temples of the horses head, the plaister of pitch, rosen, and masticke, mentioned in the chapter of watery eyes: then vnder each of his eyes with a sharp knife make a slit of an inch long, about foure fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers beneath his eyes, and at least an inch wide of the eye veines; then with a cornet loosen the skin about the breadth of a groat, and thrust therein a round peece of leather as broad as a two-pence with a hole in the midst, to keepe the hole open; and looke to it
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:26941:123"/>
once a day, that the matter may not be stopped; but continually runne the space of ten dayes: then take the leather out, and heale the wound with a little flaxe dipt in this salue. Take of Turpentine, of hony, and of waxe, of each like quantity, and boyle them together; which being a little warmed will be liquid to serue your purpose; and take not away the plaisters which are vpon his temples, vntill of themselues they fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; which being falne, then with a small hot draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Iron, make a starre in the midst of each temple veine, where the plaisters did lye, which starre would haue a hole in the midst, made with the butten end of your drawing Iron in this sort. <figure/>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now there be other Farriers which in stead of the slits vnder the eye, and the peece of leather, which is a plaine rowell, onely do take a small blunt hot Iron, and about an inch and an halfe beneath the neather lidde, to burne some 5 holes all of a row, according to the compasse of the horses eye, and to burne those holes euen into the bone; and then once a day to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynt them with fresh grease or sweet butter.</p>

This disease as farre forth as I can finde by any demonstration, is the disease which in men we call the squinansie or quinzy, and not as some of the old Farriers suppose, the strangle, for that hath no coherence with the infirmity. For the signes of the disease there needes small repetition, insomuch as the griefe is apparant to the eye; and the cure, according to the opinion of the oldest Farriers, is thus: If you see the kirnels to ranckle and swell, you shall take the horses eare, and laying it downe alongst the necke of the horse, at the very end or tippe of the eare, cut a hole through the skinne of the necke, the length of an almonde or bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and then with a crooked wire picke out all those kirnels which you finde inflamed; which done, fill the hole full of salt: then about the end of three dayes you shall finde the soare beginne to
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:26941:128"/>
matter: then wash it either with barke water, or with the iuice of sage: then take of hony, of sweet but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and of tarre, of each halfe a spoonefull, and melte them together; and as soone as you haue washt the soare cleane, put into it of this oyntment the quantity of a beane, and so dresse the horse once a day vntil he be whole. There be others of our most ancient English Farriers, which for this sorrance vse first to draw the soare right downe in the midst with a hot Iron from the root of the eare, so farre as the tip of the eare wil reach; being pulled down, &amp; vnder the root againe draw <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now the most of the Italian Farriers vse this cure: First, take a sponge steeped well in strong vinegar, and binde it vnto the soare place, renewing it twice a day vntill the kirnels bee r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tted: that done, lance it in the neathermost part, where the matter lyeth, and let it out, and then fill vp the hole with salt fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brayed, and the next day wash all the filth away with warme water and a sponge; and then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint the place with hony and fitch flowre mixt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but in any case beware during this cure, that you touch not the kirnels with your bare finger, for feare of venoming the place, which is very apt for a fistula to breede in. Now there be other English Farriers, which vse either to ripen the soare by laying
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:26941:129"/>
to a plaister of hot hogges grease, or a plaister of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley meale, mixt with three ounces of raisins, sod well together in strong wine, or else they cut out the kir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels Now whether you cut them out, burne them out, or rot them out (of all which I hold rotting the best) you shall euer fill the hole with nettles and salt being chopt and mixt together: or else taint it with tents dipt in water, and mixt with sallet oyle and salt. Others vse to burne them downeward with a hot I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron in the midst, from the eare to the iaw bone, dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing two crosse stroakes, and then lance it in the midst, and plucke out the kirnels, and fill the hole with bay salt, and the croppes of nettles well chopt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: or else put onely salt into the hole, and take the croppes of nettles well chopt and mixt with baysalt, and two spoonefull of strong vinegar, and straine it, &amp; put in either eare a spoonefull thereof, and put some black wolle after it, &amp; so bind vp his eares. Others vse to ripen them either by laying to the soare, wet hay, or hot horse litter, &amp; as soone as they are ripe (which you shall know by the softnesse, to lance the skinne, and take out the kirnels, and then fill the hole with the powder of hony and vnsleckt lime mixt together and burnt. Others vse after the kirnels are ripened &amp; taken out, to take of <hi>Egrimony,</hi> hony, and violet leaues, of each like quantity, &amp; stamping them well together, to plaister the soare therewith, till it be whole. Others vse after the kirnels are taken out, to wash the soare with copporas water, and then to tent the hole with flaxe dipt in the white of an egge; and after to heale it with waxe, Turpentine, and hogges grease molten well together.</p>

                     <p>THe strangle (howsoeuer our old Farriers make a long discourse thereof) is not (as they suppose) a kinde of quinzy, but a meane inflammation of the throate, proceeding from some cholericke or bloudy fluxion, which comes out of the branches of the throat veines into those parts, and there breedeth some hot inflammation; being stirred vp either by some great cold in winter, or cold taken after labour: it is a great and a hard swelling betweene the horses neather chappes vpon the roots of the horses tongue, and about his throate; which swelling, if it be not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented, will stoppe the horses wind-pipe, &amp; so stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle or choake him; from which effect, and none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the name of the disease tooke his deriuation. The signes of this disease besides the apparant sight thereof, and the palpable feeling of the same, is, the horses temples of his head wil be hollow, &amp; his tongue will hang out of his mouth, his head and eyes also will be swolne, and the passage of his throat so stopt, that he can neither eate nor drinke; and his breath will be exceeding short. The cure thereof according to the most ancient Farriers, is with a round small hot Iron to t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Other of the ancient Farriers vse first to bathe the horses mouth and tongue with hot water; and then annoint the soare place with the gall of a bull: that
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:26941:130"/>
done, giue him this drinke: take of old oyle two pounds, of old wine a quart, nine figges, and nine leekes heades well stamped and brayed together, and after you haue boiled these a while, before you straine them, put thereunto a little <hi>Nitrum Alexandrinum,</hi> and giue him a quart of this euery morning and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uening: also you may if you will let him bloud in the palate of the mouth, and powre wine and oyle into his nosthrels, &amp; also giue him to drinke the deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of figs &amp; <hi>Nitrum</hi> sodden together, or else to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint his throat within with <hi>Nitre,</hi> oyle &amp; hony, or else with hony and hogges dung mixt together. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Farriers vse to rowell the horse vnder the throat, and to draw the rowell twice or thrice a day, annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it with fresh butter and keeping his head warme. Other of our latter and better experienced Farriers, vse first (if his yeares will permit it) to let the horse bloud in the necke veine: then to lay to the soare this ripening plaister: take of mallowes, linseed, rue, smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, and ground Iuy, of each like quantity; boyle all these together in the grounds of beere: then put to a pretty quantity of oyle de bay, with a little <hi>Dia Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea</hi>: then take it from the fire, and therewith make your plaister, and lay it to the soare, suffering the horse by no means to drink any cold water: after the soare is broken, lay bran steept in wine vnto it, till it be whole. Others vse to cut the kirnels out betweene the iawes, &amp; then to wash the soare with butter &amp; beere, giuing the horse to drinke new milke &amp; garlike, and iuyce of the leaues of birch, or in winter the barke of birch, or else to annoint it with tarre and oyle till it be whole. Now, for mine owne part, the best cure that euer I found for the strangle was this: As soone as I found
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:26941:130"/>
the swelling to arise betweene his chappes, to take a waxe candle, and holding it vnder the the horses chappes close to the swelling, burne it so long till you see the skinne be burnt through<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so that you may, as it were, raise it from the flesh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that done, you shall lay vnto it, either wet hay, or wet horse litter, and that will ripen it, and make it breake: then lay a plaister vnto it only of Shooe-makers waxe, and that will both draw, and heale it. Now if it breake in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and will not breake outward, and so auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth onely at his nose, then you shall twice or thrice euery day, perfume his head by burning vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his nosthrels either Frankinsence or masticke, or else by putting a hote coale into wet hay, and so making the smoake thereof to ascend vp into the horses head.</p>

                     <p>MAny horses, (especially yong horses) are oft subiect to this bleeding at the nose, which I imagine proceedeth either from the great aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of bloud, or that the veine which endeth in that place, is either broken, fretted, or opened. It is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened many times by meanes that bloud aboundeth too much, or for that it is too fine or too subtile, and so pierceth through the veine. Againe, it may be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by some violent straine, cut, or blow. And last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it may be fretted or gnawne through by the sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the bloud, or else by some other euill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour contained therein. The cure is, according to the ancient Farriers, to take the iuice of the rootes of net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, and squirt it vp into the horses nosthrels, and lay vpon the nape of the horses necke, a wadde of hay dipt in cold water; and when it waxeth warme, take it off, and lay on a cold one. Other Farriers vse to take a pint of redde wine, and to put therein a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne of <hi>Bole-armoniacke</hi> beaten into fine powder; and being made luke warme, to powre the one halfe thereof the first day into his nosthrell that bleedeth, causing his head to be holden vp, so as the wine may not fall out, and the next day to giue him the other halfe. Others vse to let the horse bloud on the breast veine on the same side that he bleedeth at seuerall times: then take of frankinsence one ounce, of aloes halfe an ounce, and beate them into fine powder, and mingle them throughly with the whites of egges vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till it be as thicke as hony; and with soft Hares haire thrust it vp into his nosthrell, filling the hole so

                     <p>THese gigges, bladders, or flaps in a horses mouth, are little soft swellings, or rather pustules with blacke heads, growing in the inside of the horses lips, next vnto his great iaw teeth; they will sometimes be as great as a wal-nut, and are so painfull vnto him that they make him let his meate fall out of his mouth, or at least keepe it in his mouth vnchawed, whereby the horse can in no wise prosper: they do proceede either of eating too much grasse, or naughty rough prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hay or prouender: they are most apparantly to be felt, and the cure is (according to the opinion of the oldest Farriers) first to draw out the horses tongue of the one side of his mouth, and then take a lancet and slit the swellings the length of a date; and then with a probe picke out all the kirnels like wheate cornes very cleane: then take the yolke of an egge, and as much salt as will temper it thicke like leauen; then make it into little balles, and thrust into euery hole one; and do so once a day vntill it be whole. Other Farriers vse after they haue slit them with an incision knife, and thrust out the corruption, onely to wash the soare places either with vinegar and salt, or else with allome water. Others vse with a small hot Iron to burn the swellings, and then wash them with beere and salt, or ale and salt, and it will heale them.

                     <p>THe lampasse is a swelling or growing vp of the flesh, which ouergroweth the vpper teeth, which are the shearers in the vpper chappe, and so hindreth the horse from eating. They do proceede from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance of bloud, resorting to the first furrow or bare of the mouth, I meane that which is next to the vpper foreteeth; it is most apparant to be seene, and therefore needeth no other signes. The cure is (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the custome of the oldest Farriers, first with a lancet to let them bloud in diuers places of the swelled flesh: then take an Iron made at one end broad &amp; thin, and turned vp according to this figure, <figure/> and heating it redde hot, burne out all that superfluous sweld flesh which ouergrowes the foreteeth; and then annoint the soare place with fresh butter till it be whole.

                     <p>THE Camery or Frounce in horses, are small pimples or warts in the midst of the palate of the mouth aboue, and they are soft and soare; they will also sometimes breede both in his tongue and in his lippes: it proceedeth sometimes from the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of frozen grasse, or by drawing frozen dust with the grasse into their mouthes; sometimes by eating of moist hay, that Rats and other vermine haue pist vpon; and sometimes by licking vp of venome. The signes are the apparant seeing of the pimples or whelkes, and a forsaking of his foode, both through the soarenesse of them, and through the vnsauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinesse of the food that he hath eaten before. The cure (according to the opinion of the oldest Farriers) is first to let him bloud on the two greatest veines vnder his tongue; and then wash all the soare places with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar and salt: then get the horse new bread which is not hot, and giue it him to eate, and the horse will do well inough.

Other Farriers vse to take out his tongue, and to pricke the veines thereof in seuen or eight places, and likewise vnder his vpper lippes also, and let him bleede well: then rub euery soare place with salt very much: then the next day

                     <p>A Canker is said of the ancient Farriers to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a rawnesse of the mouth and tongue, which is full of very soare blisters, from whence will runne a very hot and sharpe lye, which fret and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rode or rot the flesh, wheresoeuer it goeth. The signes are, the apparant sight of the soare, besides the forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of his meate, because he cannot swallow it down but lets it lye halfe chawed betweene his iawes; and sometimes when he hath chawed his meate, he will thrust it out of his mouth againe, and his breath will sauour very strongly, chiefly when the horse is fasting. This disease proceedeth oftest from some vnnaturall heate comming from the stomacke, and sometimes from the venome of filthy foode. The cure is (as the oldest Farriers instruct vs) to take allome half a pound, of hony a quarter of a pint, of collombine leaues, of sage, of each a handfull; boyle all these together in three pints of running water vntil one pint be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed, and wash all the soare places therewith, so as they may bleede; and do thus once euery day vntill it be whole. Other Farriers vse first to cast the horse, and with a rolling pin to open his mouth; then with a crooked Iron wrapt about with tow or flaxe, to rake out all the stincking grasse or other meate that lieth in his iawes, and vnder the roote of his tongue: then
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:26941:134"/>
when you haue cleansed it thus, you shall heat strong wine vinegar somewhat warme, and then with the same Iron wrapt with new tow, and dipt in the vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, you shall wash all the soare places till they bleede: then wash all his tongue and his lips with the same vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar, and so let him rise; and then feed him at least 7 dayes with warme mashes and hot graines; but in no wise with any hay, and he will soone be whole. Other Farriers vse to take of the iuice of daffadill roots seuen drams, of the iuice of hounds tongue as much, of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar as much, and of allome one ounce; mixe these well together, and wash the canker therewith once a day vntill it be whole. Others vse to take of sauen, of baysalt, and of rue, of each like quantity, and stampe them together with as much barrowes grease, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint the soare places therewith vntill the canker be kild, which you may know by the whitenesse, &amp; then heale it vp onely with allome water.

Now for mine owne part, the best cure that euer I found for this sorrance, is to take of ginger and of allome, of each like quantity, made into very fine powder: then with strong vinegar to mixe them together till they be very thick like a salue, then when you haue washt the canker cleane, either with allome water or with vinegar, anoint it with this salue, and in twice or thrice dressing the canker will be whole.</p>

<pb n="266" facs="tcp:26941:136"/>
of the gummes, and also he may haue paine in his teeth, by hauing two extraordinary teeth, called the woolfes teeth, which be two little teeth growing in the vpper iawes, next vnto the great grinding teeth; which are so painefull to the horse, that he cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to chaw his meate, but is forced either to let it fall out of his mouth, or else to keepe it still halfe cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed. Againe, a horse will haue great paine in his teeth when his vpper iaw teeth be so farre growne as they ouer-hang the neather iaw teeth; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with also be so sharpe, as in mouing his iawes they cut and raze the insides of his cheekes, euen as they were razed with a knife. Lastly, a horse may haue great paine in his teeth, when either by corruption of bloud, or some other naturall weaknesse, the horses teeth grow loose &amp; soare in such maner that through the tendernesse therof, he is not able to chaw or grind his foode. Now for the seuerall cures of these infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities you shall vnderstand that first as touching the generall paine in a horses teeth, which doth come by meanes of the distillation of humors, it is thought fit by the ancientest Farriers, first to rubbe all the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side of the horses gummes with fine chalke and strong vinegar well mixt together. Other Farriers vse after they haue so washed the gummes, to straw vpon them the powder of pomegranat pils, &amp; to couer the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the head with a plaister of pitch, rosen, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticke molten together, as hath bene before declared. Now for the cure of the wolfes teeth, or the iaw teeth (acocrding to the opinion of the ancient Farri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers) it is thus. First, cause the horses head to be tyed vp high to some post or raster, and his mouth to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened with a cord so wide that you may easily see
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:26941:136"/>
euery part thereof: then take an instrument of Iron, made in all points like vnto a carpenters gouge, and with your left hand set the edge of the toole at the foote of the woolfes teeth, on the outside of the iaw, turning the hollow side of the toole downward, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding your hand steadily, so as the toole may not slip not swarue from the foresaid teeth: then hauing a mallet in your right hand, strike vpon the head of the toole a good stroake, wherewith you may loosen the tooth, and make it bend inward: then straining the midst of your toole vppon the horses neather iaw, wrinch the tooth outward with the inside or hollow side of the toole, and thrust it cleane out of his head: which done, serue the other woolfes tooth on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side in like manner, and then fill vp the empty holes with salt finely brayed. Other Farriers vse (and I haue in mine experience found it the better practise) only when the horse is eirher tyed vp or cast, and his mouth opened, to take a very sharp file, and to file the woolfes teeth so smooth as is possible, and then wash his mouth with a little allome water. Now if the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per iaw teeth ouerhang the neather iaw teeth, &amp; so cut the inside of the mouth as is aforesaid, then you shall take your former toole or gouge, and with your mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let strike and pare all those teeth shorter by little and little degrees, running alongst them euen from the first vnto the last, turning the hollow side of your toole towards the teeth, by which meanes you shall not cut the insides of the horses cheekes: then with your file, file them all smooth without any raggednes, and then wash the horses mouth with vinegar &amp; salt. Lastly if the paine do proceede from the loosnesse of his teeth, then the cure is, according to the opinion
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:26941:137"/>
of the ancient Farriers, first to cast the horse, and pricke all his gummes ouer with a lancet, making them bleede well; then rubbe them all ouer with sage and salt, and it will fasten them againe. Others vse to let the horse bloud in the veine vnder his taile next the rumpe, and then to rubbe all his gums with sage, and to giue him in his prouender, the tender croppes of blacke bryars; or else wash all his mouth with hony, sage, and salt beaten toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and by no meanes let the horse eate any moist meate: for cold, moist, and marrish feeding in the winter, onely breedeth this disease of loosnesse in the teeth; and it is of all other, most proper to the Sorrell horses.</p>

The cure whereof, according to the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the ancient Farriers, is, first to thrust a sharp hot Iron through the flesh of the necke in fiue seueral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, euery one distant from the otther three inches,

Other Farriers vse first to annoint the place with the oyle of camomill warmed, and then to lay vpon it a little hay, wet in cold water, and binde it about with a cloath, renewing it euery day the space of a weeke, to see whether it will grow to a head, or else vanish a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: if it grow to a head, you may then lance it, and thrust out the matter: then heale it vp by tainting it with flaxe dipt in turpentine and hogges grease mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten together, dressing it so once a day vntill it bee whole.</p>

                     <p>THe falling of a horses crest, is when the vpper part of a horses necke which is called the Crest, leaneth either to the one or the other side, and will not stand vpright as it ought to do. It proceedeth most commonly from pouerty and hard keeping, and especially when a fat horse falleth away sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly vpon any inward sicknesse. The cure (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the oldest Farriers) is first to drawe his crest a full strawe breadth deepe on the contrary side with a hot Iron, the edge of which Iron would be halfe an inch broad, and make both your begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and ending somewhat beyond the fall, so as the first draught may go all the way hard vpon the edge of the maine, close by the rootes of the same,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:26941:140"/>
bearing your hand right downeward into the necke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: then answer that with an other draught be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, and so farre distant from the first as the fall is broade, compassing, as it were, all the fall; but still on the contrary side, &amp; betwixt those 2. draughts, right in the midst, draw a third draught: then with an Iron button of almost an inch about, burne at each end a hole; &amp; also in the spaces betwixt the draughts, make diuers holes, distant three fingers one from another, as this figure doth plainely shewe you. That done, to kill the fire, <figure/> annoint it euery day once with fresh butter for a weeke or more: then take of mallowes, and of sage, of each one handfull; boile them well in running water, and wash the burning away till it be raw flesh, and then dry it vp with the powder of hony and lime. Other Farriers vse for this infirmity, first to cast the horse vpon some soft dung-hill, or other easie place, and with a long knife to cut away the flesh on the han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging or vnder side of the crest, euen from the fore-end thereof to the hinder end, sixe inches broad, and two inches thicke, or somewhat more in the middle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of where it is thickest: then groping the crest with your hands, to pare the thickest part thereof, till it come all to one thinnesse; then holding the horse still fast bound, to couer all the place with great handfuls of swines dung prepared for the purpose, and held to the sore place an houre together, til the bloud be stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched: then let the horse arise, and leade him into the stable, tying him in such sort, that he may neither rub his necke nor lye downe: then the next morning take
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:26941:140"/>
good store of burnt allome beaten to powder, and strew it all ouer the soare place, and so let him stand for two daies after without any stirring, lest the wound should bleed againe: then at the end of those two daies you shall bathe the soare gently with a fine linnen cloath, dipt in warme vrine; and then drying the soare, againe throw more burnt allome vpon it; and after annoint all about the out side of the edges of the soare with <hi>Vnguentum Album Camphiratum,</hi> more then an inch broad: thus you shall dresse him euery day once on that side of the crest which did fall: then for the contrary side you shall draw his maine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and plat it in many plats: which done, you shall to those plats with thongs of leather fasten a cudgell of a foote and a halfe long: then to the midst of that cudgell, you shall hang a peece of lead with a hole in it, of such weight as will poise the crest vp euen, and hold it in his right place: then shall you draw his crest on that side the weight hangs with a hot drawing I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, euen from the toppe of the crest, downe to the point of the shoulder, making diuers stroakes, one an inch and an halfe from another: then shall you lay vpon the burnt places, a plaister of pitch, tarre, and ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen, molten together, and so let the weight hang till all the soare places be healed, and there is no question but the crest will stand both vpright and strongly.</p>

                     <p>THe manginesse which is in the maine of a horse, and maketh him shed his haire, proceedeth either from the ranknesse of bloud, pouerty or lowsinesse; or
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:26941:141"/>
else of rubbing where a mangie horse hath rubbed, or else of filthy fretting dust lying in the maine for want of good dressing. The signes are the apparant rubbing and itching of the horse about the maine and necke, and the scabbes fretting both the flesh &amp; skin, besides the shedding and falling away of the haire. The cure (according to the opinion of some of our old Farriers) is, first let him bloud on the neck veine, and cut away all the haire from the scabs; then with a hot Iron as bigge as a mans finger, seare all the soare place euen from the one end to the other: then annoint all the place you so burnt with blacke sope, and now and then wash it with strong lee and blacke sope mixt together.

                     <p>BOth to a horses withers, and also to his backe, do happen many infirmities and sorrances, some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from inward causes, as of the corruption of humors, and sometime of outward causes, as through the galling, pinching, and wringing of some naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty saddle, or some heauy burthen layed on the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses backe, or such like; and of these griefes some be small, and some be great: the small are onely su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficiall blisters, swellinges, light galles, or brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, and are easily cured; but the great are those which pierce to the very bone, and be most dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, especially if they be nigh to the backe bone. Then to speake first of the smaller gallings, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer you shall see any swelling to arise, either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout your horses withers, or any other part of his backe, the cure is (according to the opinion of some of the old Farriers) first if the place be much swolne and festered, then to pierce it with a sharpe
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:26941:142"/>
hot Iron in many parts on both sides of the necke, &amp; then put into the same, tents of linnen cloath, dipt in warme sallet oile; and then after to dry and heale it vp with the pouder of hony and lime mixt together.</p>
                     <p>Others vse to take butter and salt, and to boile them together vntill they be blacke, then to powre it hot on the swelling; &amp; then to take a flake of warme horse-dung, and lay it on the soare backe vntill it be whole, dressing it once a day.</p>
                     <p>Others (especially the best of the ancient Farriers) vse as soone as they see any swelling to arise, to binde vnto it a little hot horse-dung, to see if that wil asswage it; which it will not, then to pricke it round about the swelling with a fleame, knife, or lancet, yet not too deepe, but so as it may pierce the skinne, and make the bloud issue forth: that done, take of mallowes, or smallage, two or three handfuls, and boile them in running water vntill they be so soft as pappe: then straine the water softly from it, and bruise the hearbs in a traine dish, putting thereunto a little hogges grease or else sallet oyle, or sheepes sewet, or any other fresh grease; boyle them and stirre them together, not frying them hard, but so as they may be soft and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and then with a clout lay it warme vpon the soare, renewing it euery day once vntill the swelling be gone: for it will either driue it away or bring it vnto a head, which lightly chanceth not in these small swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, except some gristell or bone be perished. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the ancient Farriers vse when they see any swelling to arise about a horses backe, first to shaue the place with a razor; and then to lay thereunto this plaister: Take a little wheate flowre, and the white of an egge beaten together, and spread it on a linnen
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:26941:142"/>
clout, which being laied vnto the swelling two or three daies, and not remoued, will bring it to a head; &amp; when you come to take it off, pull it away so softly as you can possibly; and where as you see the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion gathered together, then in the lowest place there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, pierce it vpward with a sharpe Iron somewhat hot, that the corruption may come out; and annoint the soare place euery day once with fresh butter or hogs grease vntill it be whole. Others of our latter Farriers vse when they see any swelling, onely to lay wet hay vnto it: for that will either driue it away, or bring it vnto a head; and then when it is broken you shall lay vpon it a plaister of wine lees, renewing it as often as it growes dry; and if your lees be too thinne, you may thicken them with wheate flowre: or if you like not this medicine, then you may make a plaister of thicke barme, as great as the soare, and renew it once a day vntill the swelling be asswaged, but if you see that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny corruption be knit together, then you shall lance it in the neathermost part, and let out the matter: then wash the soare either with vrine, ale, or beere, made scalding hot; then dry vp all the moisture from the soare, either with a linnen cloath or with a sponge: then couer all the soare ouer with burnt allome beaten to powder: and thus dresse the horse once a day vntill the flesh be growne vp so high as you would haue it; then shal you dresse the soare but once in two or three dayes. But if you see it skinneth but slowly, then may you annoint the edge of the soare al about after it hath bene washed as aforesaid, with <hi>Vnguentum Album,</hi> for that will make the skinne to come fast; but if you do perceiue that by dressing it thus seldome, there doth beginne any proud flesh to grow, then shall you take a
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:26941:143"/>
dram of <hi>Mercury,</hi> and mingle it with an ounce of <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guentum album,</hi> and annoint all the soare place there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, once in two daies, this will correct the proud flesh, and cause it to skin and heale suddenly. Others vse for the abating of these swellings, to boile mallows in the grounds of ale, &amp; to clap it hot to the swelling: then if the swelling do breake, then wash it with pisse, and powre hot molten butter vpon it. Others vse to shaue away the haire, and then to lay very hot vnto it, a handful of leekes stampt &amp; mixt with boares grease; or else to take a turfe of earth burnt red, and layed to as hot as the horse can suffer it. Other Farriers vse to take nettles beaten to peeces, and mixt with hot vrine, and so lay it on hot, and then set on the saddle: and then if after two or three daies dressing, the swelling breake, then looke if there be any dead flesh within the soare, and either eate or cut it out: then take a pound of fresh grease, and a pound of sallet oyle, three oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of white waxe, one ounce of turpentine, and three drams of verdigrease; melt all these together, and taint the soare therewith till it be whole: for this wil both eate away the ill flesh and incarnate good. Others take greene cole-worts, and stampe them with swines grease, and then lay it plaister-wise on the soare, and it will asswage it, especially if you ride the horse a little, to make the medicine enter in. Now if there be no great swelling, but onely the skinne chafed off, then you shall wash the place with water and salt, or else with warme wine and sprinkle vpon it the powder of hony and lime; or else the powder of <hi>Myrre,</hi> or the powder of burnt silke, or felt, or cloath, or of any old poast. Other Farriers vse when onely the skinne is gald off, to take a spoonefull of thicke creame, and to

Other Farriers vse if they see the swelling to be any thing great, first to draw round about the swelling with a hot yron, and then crosse him with the <figure/> same yron, in manner of this figure: then take a round hot yron, hauing a sharpe point, and thrust it into the

swelling place on each side vpward, towards the point of the withers, or toppe of the backe, to the entent that the matter may issue downewards at both the holes; that done, taint both the holes, first with a taint dipt in hogges grease to kill the fire, and also annoint all the burnt places therewith, continuing so to do vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the swelling be asswaged, renewing the tent euery day once, vntill the fiery matter be fallen away: then tent him againe with washed turpentine, mingled with yelks of egges and saffron, renewing the tent euery day once vntill it be whole.

weight or knobs lying directly behind the saddle: of all bruisings on the backe, it is the most vilde and dangerous, and you shall perceiue it by puffed vp and spungie flesh looking like old rotten lights about the mouth of the sore. The cure therefore is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to some of the ancients Farriers, first to cut away all the dead or proud flesh euen to the bone, then burne a hole foure inches lower then the nauell gall, and put a rowell of horse haire through it; then take the powder of oyster shels or of an old shooe sole burnt, and strow it on the sore, and euer as it waxeth moist put on more powder. Others for the nauell gall take the white of an egge, wheate flowre, hony, mustard, and sope, of each like quantity, and mixing them together make a plaister thereof; and after the dead flesh is taken out, and the sore washt with ale, butter &amp; vrine, then lay on the plaister: &amp; if the proud flesh beginne to grow againe, then the powder of an old burnt shooe, or nerue oile, or verdigrease will kill it, and the powder of oyster shels will skinne it. Other of the ancient Farriers vse, after they haue cut out all the rotten and dead flesh, to take the white of an egge and salte beaten together, and lay that plaister wise to the sore vpon a little toaw, renewing it once a daie the space of two daies, then take of hony a quarterne of a pinte, and of verdigrease one ounce beat into powder, and boile them together in a pot, stirring it still vntill it looke red, and being luke warme make a plaister with toaw, and clap it to the wound, washing and clensing well the wound, first with a litle warme vinigar or white wine, continuing so to do once a day vntill it beginne to heale and to skinne; then dry it vp by sprinckling thereon this powder following.

                     <p>ACcording to the opinion of our oldest Farriers (though my selfe haue taken little notice of the infirmitie) there is an other kind of weakenesse belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to a horses backe, which they call the fretting or biting of the reines, which doth proceed from abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of humors resorting to that place, whereby all the hinder parts of the horse doe l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <head>CHAP. 48. Of the swelling of the Coddes or stones.</head>
                     <p>THis kind of swelling or inflammation of the cods cometh either by some wound receiued, or by the stinging or else biting of some venemous beast, or else by some great straine, either in running or lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, or by the biting of one horse with an other. The cure is, according to the opinion of the
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:26941:146"/>
most ancient <hi>Italian</hi> Farriers is, first to bathe the cod with water, wherein hath bene sodden the rootes of wilde cowcumbers and salt, and then to annoint it with an ointment made of oile, goats grease, and the white of an egge; or else to bathe the cod in warme water, <hi>Nitrum,</hi> and vinegar mingled together, and also to be annointed with an ointment made of chaulke, or of potters earth, oxe dung, commin, water, and vinegar mingled together; or else to be annointed with the iuice of the hearb called nightshade, or with the iuice of hemlocke, which growes on dunghils; and if need require, to let him bloud on the flanck veines. But out later Farriers, who hold that this disease cometh oftest after some sicknesse, or surfait with cold, being a signe of amendment from that sicknesse, doe cure it in this sort; take of beane flowre, wheat meale, commin, and hogges grease, of each like quantity, and making a plaister thereof, spread it all ouer the horses cods and stones. Others boile groundsell in wine and vinegar, and so bathe the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses coddes therewith; or else take a quarte of good ale-worte, and set it on the fire, with the crummes of browne bread strongly leauened, and better then a handfull of commin made in powder; then with beane flower make a plaister of them all, and apply it to the griefe, as hot as it can be suffered; or if this helpe not, take cowes dung and seeth it in milke, and lay it vpon the swelling as hot as may be, and it will asswage it. But if this inflammation proceed from rancknes of seed, which you shall perceiue by the moist slimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his yard, then you shall first make him couer a Mare, then keepe him without prouendar, and let him bloud aboue the great veine, which is betweene
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:26941:147"/>
his hips, &amp; lay thereto hard egges, beaten in his owne dung, and make a plaister of the same and lay it to his coddes, and once a day wash his coddes with cold water. Others vse to let the horse bloud in his flancke veines, and then take of oile of roses, and of vinegar of each halfe a pinte, of <hi>Bole armonick</hi> halfe a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne beaten to powder; mixe them together in a cruse, and being luke warme annoint the cods there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, with, two or three feathers bound together; and the next day ride him into the water, so as his coddes may be within the water, giuing him a turne or two therein, and so returne faire and softly home vnto the stable; and when the horse is dry annoint him againe as before, and doe thus euery day vntill the horse be whole. Now there be other Farriers which hold that this disease may come by meanes of euill humors and corrupt bloud, which resort vnto the cods, and then the cure is to couer all the coddes ouer, with a charge made of <hi>Bole-armoniacke</hi> and vinegar wrought together, renewing it euery day once vntill the swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling goe away, or that it breake of it selfe, and if it breake, then to taint it with <hi>Mel Rosatum,</hi> and make him a breech of canuas to keepe it in, renewing the tent euery day once vntill it be whole.</p>

Now for the cure, although for mine owne parte I both doe and shall euer hold it incurable as long as a horse is a beast without reason, yet for your satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I will not stick to repeat what the best Farriers and my selfe haue practiced, in as much as it worketh much good though no absolute cure. The cure then is to bring the horse into some house or place which hath ouer head a strong baulke or beame going ouerthwart and strow that place thicke with straw, then put on foure strong pasternes with foure ringes on his feet, and fasten one end of a long rope to one of those rings, then thred al the other rings with the loose end of the rope, and so draw all his foure feet together &amp; cast him on the straw; that done, cast the rope ouer the baulke, and hoist the horse so as he may lie flat on his backe, with his legges vpward without strugling;
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:26941:148"/>
then bathe his stones well with warme water and butter molten together, and the stones being some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what warme and well mollified, raise them vp from the body with both your hands, being closed by the fingers close together, and holding the stones in your hands in such manner, worke downe the gut into the body of the horse, by striking it downewards conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually with your two thumbs, one labouring imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly after another, vntill you perceiue that side of the stone to be so small as the other; and so hauing retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the gut into his right place, take a list of two fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers broad, throughly annointed with fresh butter, and tie his stones both together with the same so nigh the body as may be, yet not ouer hard, but so as you may put your fingar betwixt; that done, take the horse quietly downe, and leade him gently into the stable, where he must stand warme, and not be stirred for the space of 3 weeks: but forget not the next day after you haue placed his gut in his true place, to vnloosen the list &amp; to take it away, &amp; as wel at that time, as euery day once or twice after, to cast a dish or 2 of cold water vp into his cods, and that will make him to shrincke vp his stones, and thereby restraine the gut from falling downe; and at the three weekes end to make your cure so much the suerer, it were not amisse to geld the stone on that side away, so shall he hardly be bursten againe on that side; and during the cure let him not eate much nor drinke much, and let his drinke be alwaies warme.</p>

are troubled with the truncheon wormes in their fundament, which will make them rub their tailes, &amp; fret the haire, yet are free both from mange and scurfe; wherfore if then you only rake the horse with your hand annointed with sope, and pull out the wormes, you shall cause the horse to leaue his rubbing; but if you perceiue the haire to shed and fall from the taile, through some small wormes that growes at the rootes of the haire, or through some little fretting scurfe, then you shall annoint all the taile with sope euen to the ground, and then wash it with very strong lye af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and that will both kill the wormes, and scoure out the scurfe; but if much of the taile be fallen away, then you shall keepe the taile continually wet, with a sponge dipt in faire water, and that wil make the haire to grow very fast.

                     <p>THe generall manginesse or leprosie, which run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth all ouer the horses body, is a cankred filthy scurfe which couereth the same, proceeding from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of melancholy corrupt bloud, ingendred by infection or vnwholsome food, or else by indiscreet labour. The signes whereof are, the horse will bee all mangie, and couered ouer with a white filthy scurfe, full of scabs, and raw plots about the necke &amp; flankes, and euill fauored to looke on, and rubbing, scratching and biting, of all diseases there is none more infectious, nor will more certainely kil a horse if it be not preuented. Now the cure according to the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the ancientest Farriers, is, first to let the horse bloud in the one side of the necke veine, and within two daies after on the other side of the necke, and within two daies after that, in the flancke veines, and last of all in the veine vnder the taile; then wash all the sore places with salt brine, &amp; rubbing them hard with a wispe of straw hard twisted, so as they may bleed well and be all raw; that done, annoint the places with this ointment, take of quicksiluer one ounce, of hogs grease one pound, of brimstone beaten into powder a quarterne, of rape oile a pint, mingle these things wel together, vntill the quicksiluer be throughly incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated with the rest, and hauing annointed all the raw places with this ointment, make it to sincke into the flesh, by holding and weauing vp and downe ouer it, a hot broad barre of yron, and then touch him no
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:26941:150"/>
more againe the space of two or three daies, during which time, if you see that he rubbeth stil in any place, then rubbe that place againe with an old horse comb, to make it raw, and annoint it with fresh ointment. But if all this will not helpe, then with a hot yron round and blunt at the point, so bigge as a mans little finger, burne all the mangy places, making round holes, passing only through the skinne and no further; for which intent it shall be needfull to pull the skinne first from the flesh with your left hand, holding it still vntill you haue thrust the hot yron through it, and let euery hole be a spanne one from another, and if need be, you may annoint those holes with a little sope, and let the horse be very thinne di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Now for mine owne part, I doe vtterly dislike this burning, for it is a foule manner of cure, and breedeth much eie-sore in the horse, and therefore other of our latter Farriers vse for this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease after they haue let the horse bloud in the necke veine, to take a good quantity of fresh grease, and mixe it well with the powder of chalke, then put thereto a good quantity of the powders of brimstone and el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecampany roots, and stirre them all well together; then take a pretty quantity of quicksiluer, and kill it with your fasting spittle, or sallet oile, &amp; mixe it with all the rest very well together, and so annoint all the sore places about the horse with this ointment. Others vse to take of lampe oile, the fine powder of brimston, of black sope, of tarre, of hogs grease, and the soote of a chimney, of each a like quantity, &amp; then mixe them all well together, by boiling them on the fire, and then annoint all the sore places therewith, as hot as the horse can suffer it, alwaies prouided that the horse
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:26941:150"/>
be let bloud before you vse the ointment. Others vse, after the horse is let bloud, to take of oile de bay a pound, and of quicksiluer one ounce, and mixing them together, neuer leaue stirring thereof, till the quicksiluer be kild, &amp; incorporated with the oile<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then annoint all the sore places therewith, after you haue made them raw by rubbing them. Other Farriers vse first to let the horse bloud, then to wash all the sore places within two daies after, with water where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in yong broome, or the hearb of arsmanarck hath bin well sod in, and smally chopt, and mix<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle soote; and rubbe him well vntill the sore places bleed, then take a pound of blacke sope, a pottle of keene mustard, foure peniworth of brimstone made into powder, three peniworth of quicksiluer well killed with fresh grease, two peniworth of verdigrease, a quarter of a pint of grease; stirre all these together in a vessell, till the grease and other things, be molten with labour and without fire, and therewithall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint all the sore places, and with once annointing and twise washing, this will cure him. Others vse if the horse be young, to let him bloud on both sides the necke, and then to cut the skin downe the middest of his forehead two fingars in length, then with a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net open the skin an inch wide on both sides the slit, and put therein thinne slices of the greene roote of <hi>Ellecampane</hi> or <hi>Angelica,</hi> which is the better; so let them remaine vnder the skinne till the matter rot, then crush it foorth after two or three daies, and in twelue daies the rootes will fall out as it healeth; and this will cure the mange, prouided, that you annoint all the sore places with the powder of brimstone, verdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grease, and oile oliue, mixt vpon a fire very well toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:26941:151"/>
Others vse after bloud letting, to rowell the horse vnder the necke, that the euill humors may haue issue foorth, then to rubbe all his body ouer with an hard haire cloth or an old curry combe, vntill the horse bleedeth; after that take of sulphur, salt, &amp; tartar, of each a like quantity, beate them and temper them, with very strong vinegar and as much common oile, and therewith annoint all the sore places; or else take very strong vinegar, the vrine of a boy vnder twelue yeares of age, and the iuice of hemlocke, mixe them together and wash the horse therewithall. Other Farriers vse after bloud letting, to annoint the horse with one of these ointments, the sore hauing bene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rubbed till it bleed, either with brimstone, oile, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar, salte, soote, swines dung, and vnsleckt lime, of each like quantity, well mixt and boild together, or else with brine water sod with nettles, or else with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar, allume and salte-niter boild together, or else wash the sore with beefe-broth; then boile pepper bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to powder, verdigrease, &amp; cheruell in fresh grease, and annoint the horse all ouer therewith, holding a chaffing dish and coales or a hot barre of yron to his body, to make the ointment sinke in. Lastly, and as good as any of the rest, after the horse hath bene let bloud, take an old curry combe, or a wooll card, and rub euery sore place about the horse till it bleed, then take of the oldest pisse you can get, a pottell, and of greene copporas three quarters of a pound; mixe &amp; stir them well together, then set them on the fire, and boile them a while; then as hot as the horse can suffer it wash him with the same; after his washing is a littell dryed, take of oile an ounce &amp; an halfe, of quicksiluer 2 oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, of white <hi>Elleborus</hi> one ounce, with a good quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

of swines grease, mingle all these well together, till no part of the quicksiluer can be seene, and then annoint the horse all therewith; and if the first time doe not cure him, the second will most assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly, prouided that during the time of cure you keepe the horse with a very thinne diet.</p>

                     <p>THere is nothing more necessary for any mans vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding that shall haue occasion at any time to vse a horse, especially for the skilfull Farrier, then to know the reason why a horse halteth, and where the griefe remaineth, as well because those griefes lye most concealed, as also because our kingdome is so full of subtill vnconscionable horse-coursers, that they are carefull most to conceale that which may soonest cozen their neighbours; you shall know then that no horse halteth before, but his griefe must be either in his shoulders, in his legges, or in his feete: if it be in his shoulders, it must either be on the toppe of the shoulder blades, which we call the withers, or at the bottome of the shoulder blade ioining to the marrowbone, which is the fore pitch of the breast, or in the elbow of the horse, which ioines the nether end of the marrowbone and the leg toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>Now for the general knowledge whether the griefe be in the shoulder or no, looke if the horse do not lift vp his leg, but traileth it vpon the ground, then it is in the shoulder, &amp; is a new hurt: if he cast his leg more out
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:26941:152"/>
in his going then the other, and that almost with an vnbended knee, then it is also in the shoulder, and it is an old hurt; if you take him by the headstall of the bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and turne him as short as you can possible of both hands, if then you see him when he is turned on the lame side, to fauour his legge very much (as he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chuse but doe) then also his griefe is in his shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; or if when a horse standeth in the stable, he stret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth out his sore legge, and setteth it more forwarde then the other, it is partly a signe the griefe is in the shoulder, but not absolutely. Now when you know generally that the griefe is in the shoulder, then you shall learne to know in what part of the shoulder, as thus; if the horse halteth more when the rider is vpon his backe, then when he is off, then the griefe is on the top of the withers; if when with your hand you gripe &amp; handle him vpon the top of the shoulder blades you find that he shrinketh much, and offereth to bite at you (not hauing had any gald backe before, for that may deceiue you) then assuredly the griefe is on the withers. If the horse goeth bowing vnto the ground, and tread his steps very thicke, then it is a signe the griefe is in his brest, betweene the nether parte of the spade bone, and the vpper parte of the maribone; and therefore if with your thumbe you presse him hard in that part, you shall see him shrinke, and be ready to fall downe. Now if when you take his elbow in your hand betwixt your fingars, and your thumbe, and gripe it, the horse presently taketh his foote from the ground and lifts vp his legge, offering therewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to bite at you, then the griefe is only in the elbow. Now if the griefe whereof a horse halteth be in his leg, it is either in his knee, in his shanke, or else in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storne

                     <p>THe griefe or pinching of the shoulder, commeth either by labouring and straming the horse too young, or by the cariage of too great burthens. It is to be knowne by the narrownesse of the breast, and by the consumption of the flesh of the shoulders, in so much that the sore parte of the shoulder bone, will sticke out and be much higher then the flesh, &amp; if it be of any long continuance, he will be very hollow vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the bysket towards the fore-boothes, and he will goe wider beneath at the feete then at the knees. The cure thereof according to the opinion of some Farri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, is, to make a slit of an inch long, with a sharpe knife, vpon both sides, an inch vnder the shoulder bone, and blowing the skinne well from the flesh, with a swans quill, both of the one and the other shoulder, euen vp to the toppe of the withers, and stroaking the wind vp equally with your hand into both the shoulders, and then when they are full, sticke the windy places with a hasell sticke ouer all the shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; then loosening the skinne from the flesh againe, rowel both the slits, either with tampins of horse haire, or with round peeces of vpper leather of an old shoe, with an hole in the midst, for the matter to issue foorth at, and let the tampins be at least two handfuls longin

the skinne, and the round rowell at least three in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches broad, and beeing so put as they may lie plaine and flat within the cut, then once a day you shall turne the rowels in the skinne, &amp; thrust out the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but if the hole grow so straight that the matter cannot easily come out, with a sharpe knife you shall enlarge it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then put a paire of pasterns on his forelegs, and so let him stand fifteene daies, at the end whereof walke him abroad, and try how he goeth, and if he do not goe to your liking, then continue him in the same manner other fifteene daies, and he will goe sound. But our best Farriers vse, after they haue rowelled the horse, as is aforesaid, then to lay this charge or plaister all ouer his withers, shoulders, and breast. Take of pitch &amp; of rozen, of each a pound, of tarre halfe a pint, boile all these together in a pot, &amp; when it is somwhat cooled, take a sticke with a woollen cloath bound to the end of it, and dippe it into the charge and couer, or daube all the shoulders therewith; that done, clap floxe of the collor of the horse, or as neare as you can get it vpon the charge, &amp; euery other day make your rowels cleane, and put them in againe, continuing thus to do the space of fifteene daies; then take out the rowels, and heale vp the wounds, with two tents of flaxe dipt in turpentine, and hogges grease molten to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, renewing the same euery day once, vntill the wounds be whole, but let the charge lye still vntill it fall away of it selfe; and if you let the horse runne at grasse, til he haue had a frost or two, there is no questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but he will be a great deale the sounder.

The cure whereof is thus, first put a paire of straite pastornes on his forefeet, keeping him still in the stable without disquieting of him; then take of <hi>Dialthea</hi> one pound, of sallet oile one pint, of oile de bay halfe a pound, of fresh butter halfe a pound; melte all these things together in an earthen pot, and annoint the grieued place therwith, and also round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the inside of the shoulder; and within 2 or three daies after, both that place and all the shoulder will swell, then either pricke him with a launcet or fleame in all the swelling places, or else with a sharp hot iron, &amp; then annoint it still with the ointement before said; but if you see that it will not goe away, but swell still and gather to a head, then launce it where the swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling doth gather most and is softest vnder the fingar, and then taint it with flaxe dipt in turpentine, and hogges grease molten together, as is before shewed, renewing the taint twice a day till the sorrance be whole.</p>

                     <p>THe shoulder pighte is when a horse by reason of some great fall, rush, or straine, hath the point of his shoulder thrust out of ioint, which is easy to be seen in that the pointe of the sore shoulder will sticke out much farther then the other, and the horse will halte downe right. The cure whereof, as the old Farriers hold it, is, first to make him swimme in a deepe water, vp and downe a dozen turnes, for that will make the ioint returne into his true place, then make two tough pins of ashen wood as much as your little fingar, being sharpe at the points, each one fiue inches long; that done, flit the skinne an inch aboue the point, and an inch beneath the point of the shoulder, and thurst in one of the pins from aboue downewarde, so as both ends may equally sticke without the skinne; and if the pinne of wood will not easily passe through, you may make it way first with an yron pinne; that done, make other two holes crosse to the first holes, so as the other pinne may crosse the first pin right in the midst, with a right crosse, and the first pinne would be somewhat flat in the midst, to the intent that the other being round, may passe the better without stoppe, and close he iuster together; then take a peece of a little line somewhat bigger then a whippe cord, and at one end make a loope, which being put ouer one of the pinnes ends, winde the rest of the line good and straight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the pinnes ends, so as it may lye betwixt the pinnes ends and the skinne, and fasten the last end with a packe needle and a packe threed vnto the rest
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:26941:159"/>
of the cord, so as it may not slippe; and to doe well, both the pinnes and the cord would be first annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a little hogs grease, then bring him into the stable, and let him rest the space of nine daies: and let him lye downe as little as may be, and put a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storne on the sore legge, so as it may be bound with a cord vnto the foote of the manger, to keepe that legge alwaies whilst he standeth in the stable more forward then the other, and at the nine daies end, take out the pins, &amp; annoint the sore places with a little <hi>Dialthea,</hi> or with hogges grease, and then turne him to grasse.

It commeth most commonly when a horse is very fat, and hath his grease molten within him, and then so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainely cooled by taking his saddle off two soone; or by standing still in the cold vnstirred, or else by letting him stand still in some shallow water little higher then

                        </gap>s, especially in the som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer season, when a horse trauelleth vpon the hard ground. The signes, to know it, is, the horse goeth crouching, and drawing all his foure feete within the compasse almost of a pecke, and will stand so feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully as though he stood vpon needles. Now you shall vnderstand, that a horse will sometimes be only foundred of his foref<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ete, and not of his hinder, which you shall know in that the horse will tread one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon his hinder feete, and not on his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feete, and goe as though his buttockes would touch the ground; and sometimes he will be foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred vpon his hinder feete, and not vpon his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeet, and that you shall perceiue by his feareful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to set his feet to the ground, being also so weake behind that he will stand quiuering and quaking, and couet alwaies to lye downe, and sometimes he will be foundred of all his forefeete, the signes whereof were first declared.</p>
                     <p>Now for as much as the cures be all of one and the selfe same nature, and what cureth the first, cureth also the rest, I will ioine them all together, with this aduice, that if you find the horse to be foundred of the sorefeet only, then to apply your medicine to the foreparts only, if on the hinder feete, then to the hinder parts; but if of all foure feete, then to lay your medicine to all the seuerall parts of the body, as shall be presently declared.</p>
                     <p>To come then to the cures, (according to the opinion of a worthy Knight well experienced in this disease) if your horse be foundred of all his foure feet, you shall cause him to be let bloud on his two breast veines
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:26941:161"/>
of his two forelegges somewhat aboue his knees, also you shall let him bloud on his two spurre veines, and on the veines of his two hinder feete a little aboue the hoofe, betweene the hoofe and the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storne: you shall let these veines bleed well to the quantity of a quarte or three pintes, which bloud you must saue in some vessell, and stirre it with a sticke to keepe it from clearing: and when he hath bled as aboue said, put it all into one vessell, then stoppe the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap> with some horse dung, or some earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and make a charge with the bloud in this sort: take as much wheat meale, branne and all, as will make the bloud somewhat thicke, and put it into the bloud: take eight or tenne egges, and breake them also into this bloud, shels and all: take a pinte of strong vinegar, and a quantity of <hi>Bole-armoniacke</hi> braid, and put them into the bloud also, which done, you shall stirre them altogether; then shall you with your hand lay the said charge all along vpon the reins of the horses backe, vpon his buttockes, and downe his shoulders: when you haue laid on this charge thus, you shall take two long linnen ragges dipped in the same charge, with which so dipped you shall garter the horse aboue the knees of his forelegges somewhat hard, and likewise with two other like ragges so dipped, you shall garter him hard aboue both his hinder hoofes also: that done, cause him to be walked vpon the hardest ground you can find, for the space of two or 3 howers: if he be loath to go, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly he will be, let one follow him, and beate him with a stick or wand to force him to go: then after this walking let him be set vp &amp; tyed to the racke, that he
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:26941:162"/>
lye not downe, and there let him rest two or three howres; which done, let him be walked againe two or three howers more as aforesaid, then set him vp, and let him feed; and when you giue him drinke, which you may doe within two or threee howres after his feeding, let it be a warme mash of malte and water, and then let him feed a little after it, then ride him a little; and if you let him stand an howre or two in a poole of standing water vp to the belly, and one vpon his backe, it is good also, and after that ride him againe a little: then let him be set vp well dressed and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, and so by little and little ride him a day or two, and then may you boldly iourney him; for it is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that bringeth the horse to the perfectnesse of his feete, and you shall find your horse as sound as euer he was.</p>
                     <p>Now during this cure, you are to take these obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations in your memory.</p>
                     <p>First you shall not need to remoue or stirre the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses shoes: then you must after twenty foure howres rub off the charge from the horse backe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Item,</hi> you shall take away his garters after twelue howres, and rub his knees &amp; houghes with your hand, and with wispes, to take away the numbnesse.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Item,</hi> if you cannot get wheat meale, you may take oaten meale.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Item,</hi> if he will will not bleed in the veines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore named, then you may take your bloud from the necke veine.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, if you take the horse in hand to cure within twenty foure howres after he is foundred, he will be sound againe within twenty foure howres after; if he goe longer, the cure will be longer in doing.</p>

                        <pb n="319" facs="tcp:26941:162"/>Now the ancient Farriers of this kingdome, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the <hi>Italians,</hi> differ not much in their practise from this already rehearsed, only into the charge they adde of <hi>Sanguis Draconis</hi> halfe a quarterne, and as much beane flower, as wheat flowre, and of turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine halfe a pound; then if they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="320" facs="tcp:26941:163"/>
faire and softly once a day vpon some softe ground to exercise his legges and feete, and let him not eate much, nor drinke cold water; but if his foundring breake out aboue the hoofe, which you shall perceiue by the loosenesse of the coffin aboue by the cronet, then when you pare the sole, you must take all the forepart of the sole cleane away, leauing the heeles whole: to the entent the humors may haue the freer passage downeward, and then stoppe him, and dresse him about the cronet, as is before said. Now if the horse during this cure, chaunce to fall sicke, or grow so dry in his body that he cannot dung, then you shall first rake him, &amp; after giue him a glister of mallowes, three handfuls boild in water from a pottle to a quart: then after it is strained, put to it halfe a pound of but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and a quarter of a pint of sallet oile, and so admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister it; then when the horse hath emptied his belly giue him this comfortable drinke. Take of malmsey a quart, and put thereunto a little cinnamon, mace &amp; pepper beaten into fine powder, and of oile a quarter of a pint, and giue the horse to drinke of that luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warme; that done, let him be walked vp and downe a good while together, if he be able to goe; if not, then tye him vp to the racke, and let him be hanged with canuas and ropes, so as he may stand vpon the ground with his feete, for the lesse he lieth downe, the better; but these extremities do seldome happen. Now there be other Farriers, which for the foundring of a horse, only take verdigrease, turpentine and sallet oile, and ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="321" facs="tcp:26941:163"/>
very hot: or else they take the rootes of nettles, and hemlocke, with elder pilles of each a handfull; boyle them tender in boares grease, or hogges grease, so let him bloud in the midst of the foote on the toe veine; then bathe and chafe his ioynt and legge therewith all about from his knee vnto the feetlocke, and then clappe it to, and binde a cloath fast to as hot as you can. So vse this once a day till he be well.</p>
                     <p>Now for mine owne part, although there is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of these former recited practises but are found per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly good in their kindes, yet I haue not found any so absolute either for old or new founder, as this which I will rehearse. First you shall with a very sharp drawing knife, draw euery part of the soles of the horses feete so thinne as is possible, euen till you see the very water and bloud issuing forth, and being sure to draw or pare euery part alike, which can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be done with a butterys: then at the very sharpe end of the frush of the horses foote you shall see the veine lye, then with your knifes end lift vp the hoofe and let the veine bleede (which as long as you hold open the hoofe wil spinne a great way forth) when it hath bled better then a pint, you shall close the hoofe and so stoppe the veine: then tacke on his foote a hollow shooe made for the purpose: that done, clap a little tow dipt in hogges grease and turpentine vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the veine very hard: then take two or three hard egges roasted, and comming burning hot out of the fire, and burst them in the sole of the horses foote: then powre vpon them hogges grease, turpentine, and tarre boyling hot, and as much flaxe dipt therein as will fill vp the hollow shooe, then lay on a peece of leather to keepe all the rest in, and splint it sure:

and in this manner dresse his foure fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now if the horse be foundred through the straitnesse of a shoo, which in truth is not a founder, but a frettizing which is a degree lesse then foundring, then you shall for that sorrance, you shall first take off his shooe, and let him bloud on the toes, then stopping the place with bruised sage, then tack on his shooe againe, and stop it with hogs grease and bran boiled together, as hot as is possible; and do thus twice in one fortnight, and it will helpe him.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. 63. Of the Splent as well on the inside of the knee as of any other part of the legge.</head>
                     <p>A Splent is to the outward feeling, a very gristle, or rather a hard bone, sometimes as big as a hazell nut, sometimes as big as a wal-nut, according to the age thereof, growing vpon the inside of the forelegge, betweene the knee and the vpper pasterne ioynt, and somtimes iust vnderneath, and close vnto the knee, which is of all other the most dangerous splent, and doth the soonest make a horse lame: it cometh by trauelling a horse too yong, or by ouerpressing him with heauy burthens, wherby the tender sinews of his legs are offended. Now for the knowledge thereof it is easy, because it is apparant vnto the eie, &amp; most pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to be felt. The cure according to the opinion of the ancient Farriers, is to take an onyon, &amp; pricking out the chore, put into it halfe a spoonfull of hony, &amp;
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:26941:164"/>
a quarter of a spoonfull of vnsleckt lime, and 4. peny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waight of verdigrease; then closing vp the onion, roast it in hot embers vntil it be soft, then bruise it in a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, &amp; as hot as the horse can suffer it, lay it to the splent &amp; it will take it away; but in any case cut no skin. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the ancient Farriers, vse first to wash the splent with warme water, &amp; then to shaue off the haire, and lightly to scarifie or pricke the skin with the point of a razor, so as the bloud may issue forth: then take of <hi>Cantharides</hi> halfe a spoonful, &amp; of <hi>Euforbium</hi> as much, beaten into fine powder, &amp; mingle them together with a spoonful of oyle de bay, &amp; then melt them in a little pan, stirring them well together so as they may not boile ouer; &amp; being so boiling hot, take 2. or 3. fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers &amp; anoint al the soare places therwith: that done, let not the horse stir fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the place where you so dresse him, for an houre after, to the intent hee shake not off the oyntment: then carry him faire &amp; softly into the stable, &amp; tye him so as he may not reach with his head beneath the manger: for otherwise he will couet to bite away the smarting &amp; pricking medicine, which if it shold touch his lips would quickly fetch off the skin; &amp; also let him stand without litter al that day &amp; night; the next day anoint the soare place with fresh butter, continuing so to do euery day once for the space of 9. daies: for this will allay the heate of the medicine, &amp; cause both that &amp; the crust of the splent to fall away of it selfe. There be other Farriers which vse with a fine hot drawing Iron to burne the sorrance downe in the midst the full length of the splent, &amp; then ouerthwart like this figure; <figure/> then 4. houres after such burning, take cows dung new made, &amp; sallet oile mixt &amp; wel beaten together, &amp; therwith anoint al the soare places; and this must be done when the splent is very yong.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="324" facs="tcp:26941:165"/>Others vse to slit the sorrance with a knife the whole length of the splent, and then with a cornet to open the slit, &amp; lay the splent bare; then to make about the wound a coffin of clay, all open at the toppe; then take boares grease made scalding hot, and powre it into the wound vntill the clay coffin be full; then let it rest vntill the grease be cold: after that let the horse rise, and this with once dressing will take the splent cleane away without any blemish or eye sore. Others vse to beate the splent with a sticke, and to bruise it well, then pricke it with an awle, and thrust out the bloud; then lay on whitleather, and with a hot Iron make the grease scald it, or else melt into it pitch and verdygrease, and then lay a plaister of pitch ouer it, not remouing it vntill it fall off by it selfe; or else af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you haue beat and prickt the splent, take out the chore of an onyon, and fill it with baysalt; then roast it soft, and lay it hot to the splent, and in steed of the onyon you may, if you will, binde to a hard roasted egge, being fire hot. Other Farriers vse to slit the skinne the length of the splent, then to dippe a little peece of linnen in warme wine, and sprinkle verdy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grease thereon, and so lay it to the slit, renewing it once a day vntill the splent bee gone. Others vse to shaue off the haire, and to rubbe the splent twice a day with tarre very hard, till the splent be gone; but this splent must be very yong and tender, for fasting spettle is as good as tarre. Other Farriers vse to take a blacke snaile and slit her, and put in bay salt, and lay it to the splent being opened, renewing it once a day vntill the splent be gone: then let the veine aboue the knee be taken vp, and let it bleede from below, lest it feede the splent againe. Others vse if the splent bee
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:26941:165"/>
vpon the knee, to burne it as is before said; then take wormewood, smallage, pellitory of the wall, and branke vrsine stampt with swines grease, and lay it to the burnings, prouided that first the haire bee shaued off, and if the splent be below the knee, this cure is good also, and much the safer. Now after all these former recited practises, you shall vnderstand that the most cleanelyest way to take away a splent, is first, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you haue cast your horse, with a hazell sticke of a pretty poyse and bignesse, gently to beate the splent at the first, and then by degrees a little harder and harder till the splent grow soft in euery part; then with the poynt of your lancet let out all the bloud and water; then take a brick-bat, and hauing laid it in the fire when it is exceeding hot, fold it vp in a red cloath, and therewith rubbe the splent, and smooth it vpon the top till you haue dryed away the bloud, &amp; that no more moysture commeth out; then take of pitch, of rosen, and masticke, of each a like quantity, melt them well together, and being very hot, lay it ouer and all about the splent, then clappe floxe of the colour of the horses legge vpon it, and so let it rest vpon the splent, vntill it fall away of it selfe; and if when it is fallen away, you perceiue that any part of the splent remaine behinde, which hardly will be if it be orderly beaten, then you shall dresse that remainder as you did the other before, and the splent will be perfectly cured. Now for the surest and most certainest way to take off a splent, it is thus: with the poynt of a sharpe knife, make a slit of more then a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley corne length iust vpon the top in the midst of the splent, and let it be so deep that you may be sure that the bone of the splent is bare; then put into that slit
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:26941:166"/>
with the point of your knife as much arsnicke as the quarter of an hazell nut; and within 3. or 4 daies, it wil so haue eaten the splent, that it will fall out of it selfe; then you shall heale vp the sore either with fresh but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter molten, or with a plaister of hogs grease and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine, mingled &amp; melted together; onely in this cure you must beware that you tye the horse so as for 24. houres he may not touch the soare place with his mouth. Now in conclusion I am to giue you this smal precept, to beare euer in your minde, that is both for the healing of this, &amp; of al other tumors whatsoever. You must first stay the falling downe of new humors to the place troubled, as by binding plaisters, as pitch, rosen, masticke, red-lead, oyle, bole-armony, and such like; then to draw out the matter which is there ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, with drawing simples, as waxe, turpentine, &amp; such like: and lastly, to dry vp the relicks with drying pouders, as hony, &amp; lime, oister shels, soot, &amp; such like; and also you must know, that all splents, spauens, or rubs, must either be taken way at the beginning, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the full of the moone.</p>

                     <p>ALthough diuers of our Farriers do distinguish &amp; make a difference betwixt a serew &amp; a splent, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the serew is euer of the out-side of the leg, as the splent is of the inside; yet it is most certaine, that the disease &amp; infirmity is all one, &amp; may as wel be cald a splent on the outside of the leg, as a splent of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side of the leg, and this splent on the outside is euer least dangerous. Now a horse many times will haue both these splents at one time, &amp; vpon one legge; nay
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:26941:166"/>
I haue seene them so iust opposite one to the other, that one would haue thought they had gone through the horses leg whence it hath come to passe, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny foolish Farriers being of that minde, haue entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them a therrow splent; and I haue seene my selfe some well reputed Farriers, that hauing the cure brought vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, haue refused the same, saying it was a therrow splent, and therefore most incurable; but the opinion is most absurd &amp; ridiculous: for the shin bone being hollow, and full of pith &amp; marrow, there can nothing grow through it but it must confound the marrow, &amp; then the bone cannot hold, but must pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently breake in sunder, especially when such a weake spongy substance as a splent is, shall possesse the whole strength of the leg. Now for the cure, as the splent &amp; it are all one, so they haue all one cure, &amp; what helpeth the first, with more ease helpeth the later, in as much as it is not ful so dangerous, nor so neare the maine si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes.</p>

and that haire in the bought of the knee is oft apt to curle, whereby those horses if they be not very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and cleane kept, are much subiect to this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease. Now for the cure according to the opinion of the old Farriers, it is thus. Take a barreld herring out of the pickell, with a soft roe, and two spoonefull of blacke sope, and so much allome; beate all these in a mortar well together, and then lay it to the soare, renewing it once a day for three dayes, and it will kill the mallander; prouided alwaies that before you lay any thing vnto a mallander, you euer pull off the dry scabbes first, and leaue no haire growing within the soare. Other Farriers vse to take a paring of cheese, &amp; roasting it very hot, annoynt it with hony, and so hot lay it to the mallander, and renew it once a day till the mallander be whole: or else beate hens mucke &amp; gillyflowers wel together, and lay it to the soare till it be whole. Other Farriers vse after they haue washt the soare cleane with warme water, and shaued off the haire and the scabs, to take a spoonful of sope, and as much lime; mingle them together that it may be like paste, then spread as much on a clout as will couer the soare, and binde it fast on with a list, renewing it euery day once the space of two or three dayes; and at the three daies end take away the plaister and annoint the soare with oyle of roses made luke warme, and that will fetch away the scurse or crusty asker, bred by meanes of the burning plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster: which scurfe being taken away, wash the soare place well euery day once with his owne stale, or else with mans vrine, and then immediatly strow vpon it the powder of burnt oyster shels, continuing so to do euery day once vntill it be whole.</p>

                     <p>THis which we call an vpper attaint, is nothing else but a painfull swelling of the master sinew, or backe sinew of the shanke bone, by reason that the horse doth sometimes ouer reach &amp; strike that sinew with the toe of his hinder foote, and thereby causeth the horse to halt much. Now the signes are both the swelling and the halting: and the cure, according to some of the old Farriers, is, to dresse the soare place with a plaister made of wine lees and wheat flowre laid hot too, or else to take of blacke sope and boares grease of each like quantity, scalding hot; make a plaister or seare-cloath thereof, and clap it all about the soare place: or else if the swelling by no salue wil dissolue, take a fine thinne hot drawing Iron, &amp; draw his legge all downward with the haire in many small striks from the one end of the swelling to the other; &amp; make the strikes very thicke together, and somewhat deep: then anoynt his burning for 2. or 3. daies with blacke sope, and so turne the horse to grasse; but if he will not runne at grasse, then euery day giue him some moderate exercise; but this burning I fancy not much, for it is soule, &amp; all be it take away the swelling, yet the seames of the burning, when they are cured, wil keepe the member bigge, as if it were still swelled.</p>
                     <p>Now other of the ancient Farriers, vse first to wash the legge with warme water, then to shaue off the haire as farre as the swelling goeth; then to scarifie the soare place with the poynt of a razor, that the bloud
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:26941:168"/>
may issue forth: then take of <hi>Cantharides</hi> and <hi>Eufor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bium</hi> of each halfe an ounce, mingle them together with halfe a quarterne of sope, and with a slice spread some of this oyntment ouer all the soare, suffering him to rest there where you dresse him for one halfe hower after; and then you may carry him into the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and there let him stand without litter, and so ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as hee may not touch the soare with his mouth: &amp; then the next day rese him in the same manner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: then the third day annoynt the place with fresh butter, continuing so to do the space of nine dayes, and at the nine dayes end make him this bath: Take of mallowes three handfuls, a rose cake, of sage, an handful; boyle them together in a sufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of water, and when the mallowes be soft, put in halfe a pound of butter, and halfe a pint of sallet oyle; and then being somwhat warme, wash the soare place therewith euery day once vntill it be whole. Others vse to cleaue a chickin or a pidgeon, and to clap it hot to the swelling, and it will abate it: or else take <hi>Dial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea, Agripa</hi> and oyle, and mixing it together, lay it to the swelling. Others vse to take of frankinsence, of rosen, of tarre, of <hi>Euforbium,</hi> of turpentine, and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nugreeke, of each a quarter of an ounce; of suet an ounce, of oyle an ounce, of waxe three ounces, and three quarters of an ounce of <hi>Myrre</hi>; mixe and melt them altogether, and plaister-wise lay it to the soare place till it be whole: or else take for this sorrance, 3. quarters of an ounce of <hi>Sanguis draconis,</hi> an ounce of bole-armony, as much oyle, three ounces of masticke, and as much suet, and as much swines grease; melt and mixe them together, and lay it to the swelling, and it will take it away; then make the shooes

of his hinder feete shorter then the hornes of his toes by a quarter of an inch, and let the horne hang ouer vncut away, and make the foreshooe no longer then his heele, but rather the shorter.</p>

Now the cure is, first to cut away the skinne, and also the hoofe and the flesh, till you haue made the soare euen &amp; plaine without any hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lownesse; then wash it very well with beere and salt, then bind vnto it a little flaxe dipt in the white of an egge, mingled with a little bole-armony, renewing it euery day once the space of three or foure dayes, and that will heale it.</p>

                     <p>A False Quarter is a rift or open back seame, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the outside, but most oftest in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side of the hoofe, because the inside is euer the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker part; which sides are euer called quarters: whence this sorrance taketh his name, &amp; is called a false quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as much as to say, a sicke and vnsound quarter: for it is as if it were a peece set vnto the hoof, &amp; the hoofe not all of one entire peece as it ought to be. It cometh many times by euill shooing, and euill paring, and sometimes by pricking the horse and such like hurts. The signes to know it are, the horse will halt much, and the rift will bleede, and when the shooe is off, the whole sorrance is apparant to be seene. The cure according to the ancient Farriers, is to take off the shooe, and cut away so much of the shooe on that side where the sorrance is, as the shooe being imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly put on againe, all the whole rift may be vnco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered: then open the rift with a drawer, and fill all the rift with a roll of tow dipt in turpentine, waxe, and
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:26941:170"/>
sheepes suet molten together, renewing it euery day once till it be whole: and the rift being closed in the toppe, draw him betwixt the haire and the hoofe with a hot Iron ouerthwart that place, to the intent that the hoofe may shoot all whole downeward; and when the horse goeth vpright, ride him either with no other shooe then this, or else with such a shooe as may beare in euery part but onely vpon the false quarter, vntill the hoofe be hardened. Others vse to annoynt it once a day with sheeps suet and oyle mixt together, and that will close the rift.

But if there be any corrupt matter gathered within the false quarter, and therby causeth the horse to halt, then you shall lay your finger vpon it, and if the horse shrinke thereat, then it is ripe; then open it with a drawing knife, and let out the matter; then lay on horse dung, oyle, salt, and vinegar mixt together plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-wise, and that will heale it, and make the hoofe good; yet howeuer, you must haue care in shooing him till his hooues bee hardened, as is before shewed you</p>

The signes to know the sorrance, are, the horse will halt much, and goe sidelong, and will traile his legge a little after him; the soare hippe also will be lower then the other, and the flesh will waste away on that side of his buttocke. The cure is, according to the best Farriers, if you take him in good time, first to cast him on his backe, and then hauing a strong pastorne on his grieued legge, with a rope draw that legge vpright, and with your handes on each side his thigh bone, guide it directly into the pot: that done, let it downe gently, and so suffer him to rise with all meeknesse; then go with him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the stable, and there charge all his hippe &amp; backe wih pitch and rosen molten together, and layd on warme; and then some floxe of his owne colour to be clapped vpon the same, and so turne the horse to grasse vntill he go vpright.

Now you must thrust in your rowell first double, and then spread it abroad with your finger: that done, taint it with a good large taint of flaxe, dipt in a little turpentine and hogs grease molten together, and made warme, and cleanse the hole and the rowell euery day once; and also renew the taint for the space of a fortnight, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you dresse him, cause him euery day to be led vp and downe a foote pace a quarter of an howre, to make the humors come downe; and at the fortnights end pull out the rowell, and heale vp the wound with the same salue, making the tent euery day lesser and lesser vntill it bee whole: and so soone as it is whole, with a hot drawing Iron draw crosse lines of eight or nine inches long right ouer the hippe bone,

                     <p>THat horse is said to bee stifled, when the stifling bone, which is a little bone of 2. inches in length, lying betwixt the neather end of the thigh bone, and the vpper end of the great hough bone of the hinder legge, is by any straine, stroake, slippe, or such like, thrust out of his right place; but if the stiflling bone be not remoued nor loosned, and yet the horse hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth by meanes of some griefe in that place, then we say the horse is hurt in the stiflle, and not stifled. The signes are these. If the horse be stifled, the stiflle bone will sticke out more of the one side then of the other, &amp; is apparant to the eye, and in his halting he will no more but touch the ground with his toe. The cure, according to the opinion of the old Farriers, is to thrust 2. round pins crosse the stifling bone, through the skinne, in such sort as you were taught for the shoulder pight; but the pinnes would not bee any thing neare so bigge, nor so long, because the stifling
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:26941:172"/>
bone is not so broad as the shoulder: and standing in the stable let him haue a pastorne and a ring vpon his sore legge, and thereunto fasten a cord, which cord must go about his necke, and let it be so much strai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as it may bring his sore legge more forward then the other, to keepe the bone from starting out; but this cure is foule and troublesome, wherefore other Farriers of better experience, vse only to set on a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten shooe vpon his sound foot, and so turne him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, that hee may bee compeld to treade vpon his lame foote; and that straining of it will in a day or two make him as sound as euer he was, and put the stifling bone into his true place againe. But if you cannot readily get a patten shooe, then you shall take either a plaine sursingle, or any other broad binding web, that will go three or foure times about the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses legge, and with it you shall garter vp the horses sound legge three fingers aboue his hamme, euen vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his maine great sinew, so strait as your selfe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother man can draw it; and then turne the horse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad where he may go vp and downe, and in eight and fortie howres the horse will be as sound as euer he was; then take off the garter, and rub the place that was gartered vp with fresh butter, for it will be much swelled.</p>
                     <p>Now if this mischance of stifling happen vnto your horse in your trauell, and that your occasions will not suffer you to stay for any of these cures, then you shall take your horse either to some deepe pond or deepe riuer that hath easie going in and out, and there swimme him vp and downe a dozen turnes: which done, you may after trauell him at your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: for the more he is laboured, the sounder he will

The cure, according to the opinion of the old Farriers, is to make a little slit in his skinne a handfull below the soare place, and then with a quill blow all the skin from the flesh vpward, then with your hand presse out the winde againe, &amp; then thrust in a rowell of horse haire from the first slit to the vpper part of the stifle bone: this done, take a pottell of old pisse, and boyle it to a quart, and clense it well; then take a handfull of mallowes, and halfe a pint of fallet oyle, and adde them to the pisse, &amp; then boyle them well together: then bathe all the soare place therewith, euery day once the space of seuen or eight dayes, and let him not stirre out of the stable during the cure, and in twentie one dayes he will be sound.

                     <p>THe bone-Spauen, or dry Spauen, is a great hard knob as big as a wal-nut, growing in the inside of the hough, hard vnder the ioynt, neare vnto the mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster veine; it groweth at the first like a tender gristell,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:26941:173"/>
and by processe of time, it cometh to be a hard bone, &amp; causeth the horse to halt much. This sorrance will come sometimes by nature or descent, as when either the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ire or the dam of the horse haue had the same dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease; &amp; somtimes (which is most generall) it cometh when a horse is laboured too yong: for a horse in that part of his hinder leg hath smal bones knit all together vpon one cluster, which being pressed before they be naturally hardened, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not chuse but thrust forth these vnnatural excretions. Otherwhiles it proceedeth from extreme labour &amp; heate, dissoluing humors, which do descend through the maister vein, continually feeding that place with euil nutriment, &amp; causeth the place to swel; which swelling in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuance of time becometh so hard as a bone, &amp; therfore is cald the bone spauen. The signes are the apparant sight of the sorrance; and truely for mine owne part, I am of the mind of other Farriers, that it is very hard absolutly to cure it; yet that the eie-soare may be taken away, &amp; the halting much eased, is not hard, for I haue done it many times. Then to proceed to the cure therof, according to the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the old Farriers, is thus: First, slit the skin iust o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the head of the spauen or excretion, and open it with a cornet, and in any case haue a care that you touch not the maister veine, but put it by: then with your lancet lay the spauen all bare, then with a fine chessell about a quarter of an inch broad, or little more, strike off the head of the spauen, to the quantity of a quarter of an almond, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the bignesse of the spauen: then take two peny waight of verdigrease beaten to fine powder, &amp; two peny waight of nerue-oyle, and beate them all well together: then laying some of it vpon fine lint,
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:26941:174"/>
lay it vpon the spauen; then lay dry lint betwixt the medicine and the veine, that the medicine may not touch the veine: then lay a plaister of pitch, rosen, turpentine, and hogges grease molten together, all ouer the hough, both to comfort the ioynt, and to keepe in the medicine. And thus dresse him the space of three daies, and it will cleanse away the spauen euen to the bottome; at the end of three dayes you shal wash away the corrosiue and the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter either with tanners water or with vinegar, and lay no more of that salue thereto for hurting the bone; then make a plaister of <hi>Diaculum,</hi> and lay it vpon a linnen cloath, and lay that plaister vnto the spauen, renewing it euery day once for the space of 7. dayes, and it will heale him vp.</p>
                     <p>Others of the old Farriers vse first to wash the spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen with warme water, and shaue off the haire so farre as the spauen extendeth, and then scarifie the place and make it bleede: then take of <hi>Cantharides</hi> one dozen, and of <hi>Euforbium</hi> halfe a spooneful; beate them in powder, and boyle them together with a little oyle de bay, lay this boyling hot vpon the soare, and let his taile be tyed vp for wiping away the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine; and then within halfe an howre after set him vp in the stable, and tye him so as hee may not lye downe all that night for feare of rubbing off the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine; and the next day annoynt it with fresh butter, continuing thus to do euery day once the space of 5. or 6. dayes; and when the haire is growne againe, draw the soare place with an hot Iron in this sort, <figure/> iust vpon the spauen: then take another hot ronlike a bodkin, somewhat bowing at the poynt, and thrust it in at the neather end of
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:26941:174"/>
the middle line, and so vpward betwixt the skinne &amp; the flesh, an inch and an halfe; and then taint it with a little hogges grease and turpentine molten together, and made warme, renewing it euery day once the space of nine dayes; prouided that first immediatly after his burning you take vp the maister veine, suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him to bleed a little from aboue, then with a red silke tye vp the vpper end of the veine, and leaue the neather end open, to the intent that hee may bleede from beneath vntill it ceasse of it selfe; and this will diminish the spauen, but not take it cleane away.</p>
                     <p>Now there be other Farriers which vse after they haue burnt it in manner aforesaid, and taken vp the maister veine, to annoynt it with fresh butter, till the burning beginne to scale, and then take of sage, and nettles, of each a handfull, and boyle them with 4. handfull of mallowes in faire water; and then put thereto a little butter, and with that bathe him euery day once for three or foure dayes till the burning be whole, and let him not wet his feete during the cure. Others vse to pricke the spauen with a sharp poynted knife, then take a peece of a candle, and lay a peece of browne paper vpon it, and with an hot Iron melt the tallow, &amp; after annoynt it with butter. Others vse first to pricke the spauen well, then to lay vpon it for three or foure dayes together, euery day, mans dung: after that lay to it <hi>Galbanum</hi> till the soare matter and rheume, and the humour come forth: then wash it with vrine, and lastly heale it vp with oyle and hony boyled together, for that will bring on the haire</p>
                     <p>Now to conclude, that which I haue euer found to bee the surest and cleanest way to take the bone
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:26941:175"/>
spauen quite away, if it bee vsed with discretion and care, is to take of <hi>Vnguentum Apostolorum,</hi> &amp; of white mercury, of each a like quantity, but of mercury ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the more; mixe them well together: then after you haue cast your horse, make a slit iust the length of the spauen, so that you touch not the maister veine: then opening it, and laying all the spauen bare, with a sharpe instrument s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>all the spauen a little; then make a plegant of lint iust so bigge as the excretion or bone spauen is: then spreading some of the salue thereon, lay it vpon the spauen: then with dry lint defend all other parts of the member, especially the maister veine from the corrosiue: then lay the plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of pitch, rosen, turpentine, and hogges grease before spoken round about his hough, and so let him rest foure and twenty howres: then take away all that medicine, and scalling the bone a little, if you finde the corrosiue haue not gone deepe inough, then dresse it in the same manner the second time, and that will be altogether sufficient: then take of turpentine, of Deeres suet, and of waxe, of each a like quantity, and mixe and melt them well together, then dresse the soare place therewith being warmed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and lint or tow dipt therein; and within a day or two you shal see the whole crust of the spauen come cleane away, then may you with the same salue, heale vp the wound; and this hath neuer failed me in any prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.</p>

                     <p>THe Hough bonny is a round swelling like a <hi>Paris</hi> ball, growing vpon the very tip or elbow of the hough, and commeth euer of some stripe, or bruise; but especially when he beateth his hough either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the post which standeth behinde him, at the neather end of his stall, or against the barre which doth diuide him from another horse; which many raunish Iades will do, when they seeke to strike at the horse that standeth next them. Now the cure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is thus, according to the opinion of the old Farri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, take a round Iron somewhat sharpe at the end, like a good bigge bodkin, and let it be somewhat ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at the poynt; then holding the soare with your left hand, pulling it somewhat from the sinewes, pierce it with the Iron, being first made red hot, thrusting it beneath in the bottome, and so vpward into the ielly, to the intent that the same ielly may is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue downeward out at the hole: and hauing thrust out all the ielly, taint the hole with a taint of flaxe dipt in turpentine and hogges grease molten together, and also annoynt the outside with hogges grease made warme, renewing it euery day once vntill the hole be ready to close vp, making the taint euery day lesser and lesser, till it be all whole. Now for mine owne part, both for this sorrance, or any other bruise in this part, I haue found this cure euer the best. First ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with rotten litter or hay boyled in old vrine, or else with a plaister of wine lees &amp; wheat flowre boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led together, to ripen the swelling, and bring it to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifaction,

or else to driue the swelling away; but if it come to a head, then to launce it in the lowest part of the softnesse, with a thinne hot I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, and so to let out the matter: then to taint it with turpentine, Deeres suet, and waxe, of each like quantity molten together, laying a plaister of the same salue ouer it, to hold in the taint vntill it be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly whole.</p>

                     <p>A Curbe is a long swelling a little beneath the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow of the hough in the great sinew behinde, hard aboue the top of the horne, which causeth the horse to halt after a little labour: for the more his sinew is strained the greater is his paine, and the more he hath rest, the lesse is his griefe; it commeth as the spauen comes, either from descent, or from great bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens when the horse is yong, or else from some strain or wrench. The signes are the apparant view thereof; and the cure according to the old Farriers, is, first to shaue off the haire, then pricke it with a fleame in three or foure places, and for three or foure dayes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, lay vnto it twice a day mans dung; then lay <hi>Galbanum</hi> to it likewise twice a day till it rot, and that the matter doth issue forth; then wash it with vrine: and lastly, heale it vp with hony and oyle boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led together, renewing the same twice a day till the Curbe be gone; and in any case let all your salues bee applyed warme and new made, and if you make an issue with a hot Iron in the bottome of the Curbe, it will not do amisse.</p>

                        <pb n="349" facs="tcp:26941:177"/>Others vse to take a very hot Iron, and hold it as nigh the soare as may be, but not touching it: then when it is warme, vent it in sixe or seuen places: then take a spoonefull of salt, halfe a spoonefull of nerue-oyle, and a peny waight of verdigrease, &amp; the white of an egge; mixe these well together, &amp; dipping flaxe in the same, lay it to the Curbe: and this in few dressings will take it away. Other Farriers vse to chafe and rub the Curbe well with their hands: then take redde wall-wort leaues, and borage, and braying them well together, lay it to the Curbe, renewing it once a day for a seuen night together. Others vse to slit the Curbe all the length, then take a peece of lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen cloath, and wet it in wine made warme: then strow verdigrease therupon, &amp; bind it to the soare, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing it once a day vntill the curbe be gone. Others of the ancient Farriers take of wine lees a pint, of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min halfe an ounce, and as much wheate flowre as will thicken it, and stirre them well together; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made warme, charge the soare place therewith, renewing it euery day once the space of 2. or 4. daies, and when the swelling is almost gone, then draw it with a hot Iron made very thin in this sort, <figure/> and couer the burning with pitch and rosen molten together, and laid on good and warme, and clappe thereon some floxe of the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses colour, or so nigh as may be gotten, and remoue them not vntill they fall away of themselues; and for the space of nine dayes let the horse rest, and come in no wet.

                     <p>THe paines is a certaine vlcerous scabbe growing in the pastornes of a horse, betwixt the fetlocke and the heele, full of fretting matterish water, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth onely for want of good rubbing and cleane dressing, after the horse hath bene iourneyed in the winter wayes, by meanes whereof the sand and durt remaining in the haire, fretteth the skinne and flesh, and so breedeth to a scabbe; and therefore your <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonds,</hi> and <hi>Flaunders</hi> horses and mares, which now are so much in vse with vs for the coatch, are the soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest troubled with this disease, if the keeper bee not much the more carefull.

<pb n="356" facs="tcp:26941:181"/>
more then one or two of a cluster, and they are so painfull, especially in the Sommer season, when the weather is hot, &amp; the waies hard, that the horse is not able to trauell, but halteth downe right: they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed commonly from extreme labour in the Sommer time, vpon hard waies, whereby the humors being dissolued, do flow and resort into the hollow places a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the nether ioynts, which are most beaten &amp; fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with trauell, and there are congealed &amp; couered with a thin skin like a bladder: they are most apparant to bee seene &amp; felt, &amp; the cure therof, according to the old Farriers, is to take a knife and open it the length of a beane, piercing no further into it then through the skinne of the bladder, and then thrust out the ielly, which, as I said before, will be like the white of an egge; then take the yelke of an egge, and as much oyle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bay as a good nut, and mixing them together, make a plaister therof and lay it to the soare, &amp; in 2. or 3. daies it wil heale it. Others of the old Farriers dresse it with <hi>Euforbium</hi> and <hi>Cantharides,</hi> in such sort as is shewed for the taking away of the splent; but if that will not serue, then with a hot drawing Iron to draw the wind-gall in this sort, <figure/> then to open the middle line with a launcet the length of a beane, and thrust out the ielly: then lay pitch and ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen molten together vpon it, and then a few floxe, and that will take it cleane away. Other Farriers vse to take vp the maister veines on the inside of his legges, and suffer him onely to bleede from below: then hauing put vp the veine, couer all his legge ouer with a plaister of wine-lees and wheat flowre mingled together, and roll it with a long roller: dresse him in this sort once a day till he be whole.</p>

                        <pb n="357" facs="tcp:26941:181"/>Others vse to open the skin and put out the ielly: then take a spoonefull of oyle de bay, a spoonefull of turpentine, a penyworth of verdigrease, the white of an egge, and a quarter of an ounce of red lead; boyle them together till it come to a salue; then lay it to the wind-gall and it will cure it; or else after you haue let out the ielly, take rosen, sheepes suet, &amp; brimstone, of each a like, &amp; melt them together, and lay that vpon the wind-gall, so it be not too hot, and it will cure it. Others take the rootes of comin and beate them well with a little salt, and lay that to the wind-gall; or else annoynt them with the iuyce of onions or leeke blades, and that will allay them: or else ground Iuy and wormewood with the rootes sod in wine and layd to the wind-gall, will take them away. Others of our later experienced Farriers, take an ounce of white waxe, an ounce of rosen, two oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of raw hony, three ounces of swines grease, two ounces of oyle of the yelkes of egges, fiue ounces of oyle de bay; mixe all these well together and straine them; then rub them into the wind-gall, by holding a hot barre of Iron against the oyntment, and it will take the wind-gall away. Now for the making of the oyle of yelks of egges, it is thus: First seeth the egges hard, then stampe them, and then seeth them in an earthen pot with a soft fire, and so straine them. Now this medicine will not onely heale the wind-gall, but the ring-bone also, it is very good for the abating of the wind-gall, &amp; for making the medicine to work the better, to let the horse stand in a cold running streame an howre morning and euening.

                     <p>If then your horse haue taken any halt, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by stiffenesse of sinewes, straine, wrinch, stroke, or any other accident, if the griefe bee in his legge, you shall take smallage, oxe eye, and sheepes suet, of each like quantity, chop them all together, and boyle it in mans vrine, and bathe all the legge therewith: then with hay-ropes wet in cold water, rolle vp his legge, and he will be able to trauell the next day: or if you seeth a pound of blacke sope in a quart of strong ale till it looke like tarre, and anoynt the legge therewith, and it will supple his sinewes, &amp;
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:26941:183"/>
bring them to their true course. If you wash his limbs in the grounds of beere or ale made warme, and then rope them vp in hay-ropes, wet in the same, it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer a straine. If you take of the flowre of linseed, of turpentine, and of life hony, of each a like, and boyle them with white wine vntill they be thicke, like vnto an oyntment: then spread it on a cloath, and lay it to the griefe, and it will take away any atche or paine in the sinews: likewise a plaister of wine lees and wheate flowre, or a plaister of blacke sope and boares grease will doe the like. If you mixe nerue-oyle, oyle de bay, and aqua-vitae together, and warme it, and chafe it in, and vpon, and about any straine, it will take the anguish quite away. If the griefe be in the shoulder, or the hinder legge, then burne him vpon the very ioynt by taking vp the skinne with a paire of pinsons, and thrust the skinne through with a hot iron ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart; and if this cure him not, then his paine is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the thinne skinne and the bone, which must then be rowelled. If the griefe be in the shoulder, or in the hippe, or else where, then let him bloud, and sauing the bloud, mixe therewith the powder of fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinsence, and annoynt the horse with the same. If the griefe be only in the sinews, then take the plaister cald <hi>Sologliatium,</hi> made of gum-dragant, new waxe, pitch, and turpentine mixt together; or else take the yelkes of two egges, an ounce of frankinsence, and a little branne, and beate them well together, and lay it to the paine. If the griefe do proceed from a hot cause, then let the horse bloud, &amp; with that bloud mixe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar &amp; oyle, &amp; anoynt him, &amp; chafe it well in. But if it proceed from a cold cause, then let him bleed a little and with figs soaked a day in warme water, &amp; as much

If it come either by any rush or stripe, let the horse bloud, and with that bloud mingle strong vinegar, egges, shels and all, three ounces of <hi>Sanguis draconis,</hi> foure of bolearmony, and fiue of wheate meale, and daube it all ouer the soare place. If the griefe be in the shoulder, and the skinne broken, take galles of <hi>Soria</hi> pund, and mingle them with hony, and lay it to the soare. If his paine come from the stiffenesse of his ioynts, take a pound of blacke sope, and boyle it in a quart of ale till it be thicke, and it will comfort the ioynts. If the ioynts be sweld, take rosen, pitch, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine, and <hi>Sanguis draconis,</hi> molten together, and lay it to the swelling something warme, and it will either take away the swelling, or else ripen it &amp; make it runne. If you take of the oyle of Camomile, oyle of Dill, butter, and Agripa, of each a like quantity; or else make a plaister of an ounce of turpentine, halfe an ounce of verdigrease, and the marrow of a Stagge; or bathe the horse with warme water, wherein Rose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary hath bene sod, and it will ease any paine what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever. If the horses paine be in his shoulder, first with a launcet pricke the skinne through betweene the spade bone and the marrow bone: then putting in a quill, blow the skinne from the flesh euen all about: then thrusting out the winde with your hand, put in a rowel; then take a pottle of stale vrine, seeth it with a pound of butter, &amp; as much swines grease, a handfull of mallows, a handful of tansey, a handfull of veruine, a handful of red nettles, a handful of southernwood, and a handfull of balme leaues; then beate them all well together, and so annoynt his shoulder therwith, and let him not go forth of the stable for seuen daies.

If his griefe bee in any neather ioynt, then take a handfull of laurell leaues, and of prim-rose leaues, of ground Iuy, of crowfoot, of mallowes, of red fennel, and of fine hay, of each of them seuerally as much; seeth them well together, and then let them stand foureteene dayes; then bathe the ioynt once a day, &amp; binde of the hearbes vnto it for foure dayes together: then after chafe into the ioynt fresh grease and oyle mixt together, and it will ease all his paine. Now to conclude, if any ioynt or member about a horse be by the fluxe of humors sweld and growne out of shape whereby the horse goeth stiffe, and halteth; then to dissolue those humors take wormewood, sage, rosemary, the barke of the Elme tree, and of a Pine, together with lin-seed, and boyling these together, make a bathe or <hi>pultus</hi> thereof, and lay it to the sicke member, and it will dissolue the humours, and so likewise will figs being stampt with salt, and applyed to the soare.</p>

Now for the cure, according to the opinion of the old Farriers, it is thus: Take of oyle oliue one ounce, of turpentine two or three ounces; melt them together ouer the fire, and then put thereunto a little waxe, and working them all well together lay it plaister-wise vnto the soare, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing it once a day vntill it be whole.

horse come in no wet during the cure. Other Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers vse (and sure it is the better practise) first, after they haue shaued away the haire, and layd the soare raw, to wash it well with old vrine very warme; then take blacke sope, mustard and vinegar, of each a like quantity, and mixe therewith some of an Oxe gall; then stirre them well together, and chafe and rubbe the place therewith, and binde thereto a cloath, so vse it once a day till it be whole: then after annoynt it with neats foote oyle to supple the sinewes againe. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers vse to take the finest hay, and burne it to ashes vpon a faire boord, then mixe it with neats foot oyle, and make a salue thereof; then all to rubbe the soares vntill they bleed almost, and then annoynt them with the said salue, and rope his legges, and keepe them from wet. Others vse after they haue washt the soare with old stale, then to take a quantity of strong mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard, vinegar, gray sope, barrowes grease, and some quickesiluer; mixe them together, and therewith an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynt the soare. Other Farriers take a quantity of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleckt lime, halfe so much blacke sope, and so much of strong vinegar as shall suffice to make it like an oyntment: then the haire being cut away, and the soare washt with vrine, lay to this oyntment, renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it not the space of two dayes, and it will kill the sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: then wash the place once or twice with warme wine; then after heale it with turpentine and hogges grease molten together, and in no wise let the horse come in any wet.

<pb n="368" facs="tcp:26941:187"/>
Others take of hony and verdigrease of each a like, and boile them together vntill halfe bee consumed, and then annoynt the soare therewith once a day vntill it be whole. Others of our latter Farriers vse either to shaue off the haire, or scald it off with orpiment, and vnsleckt lime boild in strong lee; then wash it with warme vinegar, or white wine, then when it is dry annoint it with this oyntment. Take of orpiment one ounce, of verdigrease three ounces, of soote fiue ounces, a lttle vnsleckt lime, and of hony one pound; mingle them all well together vpon a soft fire, and being made like an oyntment vse it as aforesaid once a day to the soare; or else take hony, sope, verdigrease, vnsleckt lime, and vinegar, and boyle them with allome, galles, and maile, till it come to a plaister, and then apply it vnto the soare; or else boyle sallet oyle with a little suet and sope, then skinne it and take it from the fire; then adde an ounce of quickesiluer resolued, two ounces of verdigrease, three ounces of vnsleckt lime, and one ounce of white waxe: when all these are well mixt together, and made into a salue, then apply it once a day vnto the soare, vntill it bee whole. Other Farriers vse, after they haue sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the place, to boyle vinegar and the skinne of larde or bacon together, and to apply that to the soare three daies together: then take larde molten, litargie, masticke, verdigrease, and soote mingled together, with goates milke, and lay it to, renewing it once a day vntill the soare bee healed. The scraping of a pannes bottome mixt with the inner pilles of Elder, are also good for the Scratches; or new mans dung applied for fiue dayes, aud after annoynt the soare with oyle and sope mixt together. Others take of vnsleckt
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:26941:187"/>
lime, the dowder of glasse, and of verdigrease, of each-one an ounce; of orpiment an ounce, of oyle and of fresh grease, of each foure ounces; mixe all these well together, and apply it to the soare vntill it be whole; If you take blacke snailes and burre rootes, and beate them together, it willl also helpe this sorrance. Other Farriers take an ounce of sope, two ounces of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleckt lime, and as much lye, or strong vinegar as will temper it, and so dresse the soare vntill it bee whole. Others take fenugreeke and beate it, three oranges cut in peeces, halfe a pound of sheepes suet, newe sheepes dung; boyle all these in the grounds of good ale, and then bathe the horse therewith as hot as may bee: then rope him vp with hay ropes, and so let him stand three daies, then bathe him him so againe. Others take hogges grease, sope, brimstone, soote, and hony; boyle them, and lay them too cold, you may also adde verdigrease; but before you lay on this oyntment, scrape the scabbes off and make them bleed, and rubbe them with sope, mustard, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar, mixt together.</p>

by an ignorant smith, the anguish whereof looseneth the gristell, and so breedeth euill humors, whereof the quitterbone springeth: the signes are, the horse will halte much, and the swelling is apparant to the eye, which in foure or fiue daies commeth to a head, and will breake out with matter at a little deepe hole like a fistula; and surely then this quitterbone, there is no outward sorrance whatsoeuer more dangerous to a horse. The cure thereof according to the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of some of the ancient Farriers is, first to cut the hoofe to the quicke: then seeth a Snake or an Adder till the flesh part from the bone, and be molten as an vnguent; then annoint the soare place therewith very warme euen to the bottome, and during the cure keepe the foote cleane from any filth; for this both drieth, and killeth the quitterbone. Other of the old Farriers, first burne about the quitterbone with a hot yron, in maner of a halfe circle, &amp; then with the same yron draw another right through the midst thereof in this sort <figure/>: then take of arsnicke the quantity of a beane beaten into fine powder, and put it into the hole, thrusting it downe to the bottome with a quill, and stop the mouth of the hole with a little tow, and bind it so fast with a cloth and a roller, that the horse may not come at it with his mouth, and so let it rest for that day; and the next day if you see that the soare looketh blacke within, then it is a signe that the arsnicke did worke well; then to allay the burning of it, taint the hole with flaxe dipt in hogges grease, and turpentine molten together, and couer the taint with a plaister of pitch, rosen, waxe, and turpentine molten together, but there must be as much terpentine as of all the rest: and thus
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:26941:190"/>
you must continue to doe vntill you haue gotten out the chore, which the arsnicke did eate; then shall you see whether the loose gristel in the bottome be vnco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered or not: and if it bee not vncouered, then feele with your fingar or with a quill, whether you be nigh it or not; and if you be, then raise the gristell with a little crooked instrument, and pull it cleane out with a paire of smal nippers or mullets made for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: that done, thrust it againe with a full taint, dipt in the foresaid oyntment, to asswage the anguish of the last dressing, and stop it hard to the intent that the hole may not shrinke together or close vp: and the next day take out that taint, and taint it anew with hony and verdigrease boild together, till they looke redde, renewing it euery day once vntill it be whole, keeping alwaies the mouth of the soare as open as you may, to the intent that it heale not vp too fast, &amp; let not the horse come in any wet, nor trauell vntill he be perfectly whole.

                     <p>Grauelling is a certaine fretting of grauell, sand, or dirte vnder the foote betwixt the sole and the shooe, sometimes on the inside, and sometime on the outside of the foote, and sometimes of both sides of the heele. It commeth, as I said, by meanes of little grauell stones getting betwixt the hoofe, or calking or sponge of the shooe, which by continuall labour and trauell of the horse, doth eate through the hoofe into the quicke of the foote; and the rather if the horses heeles bee soft and weake, or that the shooe do lye flat to his foote, so as the grauell being gotten in it cannot get out againe. The signes whereof are these, the horse will halt much, and couet to goe most on his toe, to fauour his heele, and the softer the way is, the more is the horses case. Now for the cure according to the old Farriers, it is thus; first pare the hoofe till you may see the soare, then take an ounce of virgin waxe, and a quarter of an ounce of rossen, and a quarter of deares suet, &amp; halfe an ounce of boares grease, and beate them all well together in a morter, and then melt them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the fire; that done, dip good stoare of flaxe therein, and so stop vp the soare close and hard, and then you may trauell the horse whither you please; and do thus once a day vntill the foote bee sound. Other of the old Farriers vse, first to pare the hoofe, and to get out the grauell with a drawing knife, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing none behind; then stop the soare place with turpentine and hogges grease molten together, and
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:26941:191"/>
laid one with a little tow or flaxe, and then clap on the shooe, to keepe in the stopping, renewing it eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day once vntill it be whole, and suffer the horse to come in no wet vntill it be healed. Now you must vnderstand that if a grauelling be not well stopt to keepe down the flesh, it wil rise higher then the houe, and so put the Farrier to much more paine, both in bolstring it, and abating that ill growne substance. Others vse onely to pare the foot, and pricke out all the grauell cleane, then wash it well with beere and salt; then melt into it tallow, rosen, and pitch: then couering it hard and close with flaxe, set on the shooe againe, and doe thus once a day. Others vse after they haue cleansed the soare, to lay hurds into it, being dipt in the white of egs, then after heale it with salt beaten small &amp; mixt with strong vinegar, or else with the powder of galles, salt, and <hi>Tartar,</hi> mixt together which also is good for any cloying or pricking.</p>

                     <p>Svrbating is a continual beating of the hoofe against the ground, &amp; it commeth sometimes by meanes of euill shooing lying too flat to his foot, or by going long barefoot; and sometimes by the hardnesse of the ground, and the high lifting of the horses feete, either in his trot, or in his amble; and the horses which are most subiect to this sorrance, are those which haue ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great round feete, or such as are flatte footed, the coffins whereof are weake and tender, and also those which haue weake heeles.

stiffe, as if he were halfe foundred; and the cure, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the opinion of the old Farriers, is to roast a couple of egges exceeding hard, and then in the very violence of their heate, to burst them in the horses feete, and then powre hot boyling sallet oyle also amongst them, and to stoppe the shooe vp close with a peece of leather, and two crosse splents of wood, and doe thus thrice in one fortnight, and it will helpe him. Others of the ancient Farriers, take off the horses shooes, and pare him as little as may be; and if the shooes be not easie, that is to say, long, large, and hollow enough, then make them so, and tacke them on againe with foure or fiue nailes: that done, stoppe his feete with hogges grease, and branne boyled together so hot as may bee, and also couer all the coffin round about with the same, bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all in together with a cloath, and a list faste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned about the ioynt, renewing it euery day once vntill it bee sound; and giue the horse during the cure, warme water to drinke, and let him stand drye, and not haue much trauell.

whatsoeuer, by meanes whereof hee is prickt in the soale of the foote, the rider shall perceiue the same by the sudden faltring of the horse, who will instantly stand still and lift vp his foote, as desiring helpe: and if it chance at any other time, then the halting of the horse, and the diligent searching of a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Farrier must finde out the mischiefe. Now the cure, according to the opinion of the ancient Farriers, is first to pull off the shooe, and pare the foote, and with a drawing knife, vncouer the hole, making the mouth so broade as a twopence: then tacke on the shooe againe: that done, stoppe it by powring into the hole turpentine and hogges grease molten together, and lay some flaxe or tow vpon it; and then stoppe all the horses foote with cowes dung, and so couering it with a peece of leather, splent it with two crosse stickes so as the stopping may abide in, renewing it euery day once vntill it be whole, and let the horse treade in no wet.</p>
                     <p>Now you must bee very carefull in the curing of this sorrance: For if it bee not healed from the bottome, besides that it is dangerous to the life of the horse, it is also a great hazard that the soare will breake out at the toppe of the hoofe, and so loosen the hoofe round about, and perhaps make it fall cleane away; but if you see that it beginne to breake out aboue, then make a greater issue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, by opening the hole wider, and taking more of the soale away, that the flesh may haue the more liberty: then take of bolearmony halfe a quarterne, and of beane flowre as much, and two egges; beate them, and mingle them well together, and make a plaister thereof vpon tow, and lay it round about
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:26941:193"/>
the cronet, binde it fast on, and so let it remaine the space of two daies, and then renew it againe, not failing so to do euery two dayes vntill you see it waxe hard and firme aboue: for this plaister being restrick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, will force the humours to resort alwayes downeward; which humours must bee drawne out with turpentine and hogges grease, as before, vntill it leaue mattering; and then drye it vp with burnt allome beaten into powder, and strewed vppon the soare, with a little flaxe layd againe vppon that, continuing so to doe euery day once vntill it bee hardened; and let not the horse come in any wet vntill it bee whole.

<pb n="381" facs="tcp:26941:193"/>
so as you may pull it out with a paire of nip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers: but if it lye very deepe, then you must o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the place with a launcet, and thrusting in your mullets or nippers, pull it out by strength, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards heale vp the wound, as was before taught in the last chapter.</p>
                     <p>Other Farriers say, that the rootes of reedes being stampt and mixt with hony, it will draw out any stubbe or naile: so will also blacke snailes being stampt and wrought with fresh butter. Now if the place bee much swolne, then it is good to mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie it with a plaister made of worme-wood, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietory, beares foote, hogges grease, and hony, well boyled and mixt together, which will asswage any new swelling that commeth by stripe or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</p>
                     <p>Now when you haue gotten out that which you sought for, then you shall first powre into the wound scalding oyle Oliue; when that is cold, powre into it as hote turpentine; when that is cold, strew on the powder of Sulphure, and then bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster his foote or the soare with hurds, and keepe it from all wet and filthinesse.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. 95. Of a Retrait.</head>
                     <p>A Retrait is when a horse by the ill gouernment of the smith, is prickt in the foote with some ill dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen naile, yet in such sort that it is immediatly espied, and the naile drawne backe againe; and although it proceedeth of test from the negligence of the smith, yet it may also come by reason of the weakenesse of the naile, and the hollowesse of the shanke: for when the naile is a little too weake, the point many times bendeth awry into the quicke, when it should go right foorth; and when it is hollow it shiuereth in the driuing into two parts, whereof one part razeth the quicke in pulling out, or else perhaps breaketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder, and so remaineth still behind: and this kind of
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:26941:194"/>
pricking is the worst of all other, because it will ranc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle worst, in as much as the flaw cankereth and remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth stil in the foot. The signes hereof are, 1. the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant shrinking &amp; struggling of the horse assoone as the quick is touched, and next his much halting: last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you shall search his foote with a hammer, by knoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vpon the clinch of euery naile: for when you knocke vpon that naile where the griefe is, the horse will shrinke vp his foote; and if that will not serue, then grope the hoofe with a paire of pinsons round about vntill you haue found the place grieued. Now the cure, according to the opinion of the ancient Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers is, first to pull off the shooe, and then open the place grieued, either with a butteris or with a draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing knife, so that you may perceiue either by feeling or seeing, whether there be any peece of naile or not; if there be, then pull it cleane out; after take of nettles halfe a handfull, and bruise them in a mortar, and put thereto a spoonefull of redde vinegar, and a spoonefull of blacke sope, and two ounces of brocks grease, or the fat of salt bacon, and bray all these wel together, and stop well the hole of the soare with this, and then tacke on the shooe againe, &amp; you may safely aduenture to trauel him. Other Farriers vse after they haue opened the soare to stop vp the hole with turpentine, waxe, and sheepes suet molten together; and so poured hot into the hole, and then lay a little tow vpon it, &amp; clap on the shooe againe, renewing it thus euery day once vntill it be whole; during which time the horse must not come in any wet, and it must be stopped in this sort, though it be but prickt without any peece of naile remaining: &amp; if for lacke of looking to in time, this retrait causeth the horse to
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:26941:195"/>
breake out, then you shall cure it either with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strictiue plaister of bolearmony, beane flowre, and egges, mentioned in the 97. chapter: or else with chopt nettles and verdigrease, spoken of in the last chapter.</p>
                     <p>Now there be other Farriers, which not onely for this retraite, but for any pricke in the horses foot, vse after they haue layd open the wound, to take of turpentine one ounce, of tarre one ounce, of pitch one ounce, of beefe suet one ounce, and one head of garlicke; boyle them all together, and lay them to it so hot as may be suffered; and if it chance to breake out aboue the hoofe, then apply also the same medicine vnto it, and it will cure it.</p>

                     <p>A Horse is said to bee cloyed with a naile, or prickt with a naile, when the whole naile is stric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into the quick of the foote, and so remaineth stil in the same, &amp; is clinshed as other nailes be, by means wherof the horse halteth extremly. Now this griefe is knowne by searching the grieued place with a ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer or pinsons as is before said. Now for the cure, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the opinion of the old Farriers it is thus; if the horse halt immediatly, then pul off his shooe and open the hole vntill it beginne to bleed, and then stop vp the hole with turpentine, waxe, and sheepes suet molten together, and poured in very hot, renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it once a day vntill it be whole; and let the horse tread in no wet, and let his shooe bee tackt on againe as soone as he is drest. Others vse onely to poure into
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:26941:195"/>
the hole hot scalding butter, and that will heale it; or else to burne the hole with another naile, and that will cure it. Other Farriers vse after they haue ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned well the soare to take halfe a pound of frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, a pound of rosen, a pound of pitch of Greece, halfe a pound of blacke pitch, a pound of new waxe, a pound of goats grease, halfe a pound of varnish, halfe a pound of turpentine, two ounces of oyle oliue; and melt them altogether, and lay this vnto the hoofe plaisterwise, and it will not onely heale any pricke whatsoeuer, but also any crackes, chincks, or clifts in the hoofe howsoeuer they breed; prouided that you let the horse tread in no wet during the cure; but if the soare chaunce to breake out on the toppe of the hoofe, then you shal take two or three yelks of egges, whites and all beaten together, and adde thereunto an ounce of bolearmony, and as much beane or wheate meale as will thicken the same: then make a plaister thereof two fingers broad, and as long as will goe round on the toppe of the horses hoofe, bind it fast on with a roller, and renew it once a day vntill it be whole.</p>
                     <p>Other Farriers vse after they haue searched and laid open the wound, to put into it hurdes dipt in the white of an egge, then stoppe the whole with salte beaten very small, mingled with veruin, and strong vinegar, and couer it with flaxe dipt in strong vinegar; or else holding vp the horses foote, poure into the wound hote scalding oyle oliue; and when that is cold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> poure in hote turpentine, and that being cold strew vpon it the powder of sulphure; then lay on a bolster of flaxe, then shooe him, and keepe him from treading in any wet. Others vse to take tallow,

the powder of Sulphure, mallowes, and very strong vinegar; boyle them together vntill they be thicke like an oyntment: then lay the same to the soare, as hote as the horse can endure it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing it once in twelue howres till it be whole.

before I speake of the particular diseases of the houes, to shew you some generall notes and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations which you shall obserue for the benefite of the feete. Know then that first it is meete that you let your shooes before be short, with strong spunges, but no cawkins, and your nailes to haue speciall good heads.</p>
                     <p>Let your shooes behinde haue a cawkin on the out-side; but if he enterfeare, let the cawkin bee on the in-side to make him cast outward, and let the inside of that side inward haue a welt an inch deepe, or be twice as thicke as the out-side: but if all this helpe not his enterfearing, then bring him to an amble; but if hee will not amble, burne him with a hote Iron betwixt the legges, that the soarenesse therof may make him goe wide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde, which is an odinary practise amongst the French-men.</p>
                     <p>Let your shooes bee made of Iron that will not breake, of which our English is best, the Spanish next, and the Danske worst. Let them also be light, yet so as they may bee able to beare the burthen of the horse, being broader at the toes, then at the caw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins or spunges.</p>
                     <p>Let your cawkins be short, and blunt at the points, and your spunges long and thicke.</p>
                     <p>Let your shooe be full as straite as the horne of the hoofe so farre as the nayles goe, and from the two heele-nayles backward, let the shooe be broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then the hoofe, that the shooe may be without the horne.</p>
                     <p>Giue vnto euery shooe nine nailes, on each side foure, and one in the midst; and let the shankes of
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:26941:197"/>
the nailes bee very flat and thin, that if the hoofe be naught, they may yet keepe the shooe firme with little hold, and the nearer that your nailes are driuen backeward towardes the heele (so it bee without danger) the faster the shooe will sit, and the harder to be puld away.</p>
                     <p>Let your cawkins sit a strawes breadth behinde the corner of the coffin, and let your naile heads enter into the shooe, especially on the outside, and by all meanes hollow your shooe so little as may be.</p>
                     <p>Pare very little or nothing at all from the heele of a horse; yet open his heeles as sufficiently as may be, because euer the heele must be thicke, and the toe thin.</p>
                     <p>In faire waies pare the soale thin, but in frost or sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wayes, pare as little as may be.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, when the hoofe is higher on the out-side then on the in-side, it will make a horse en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeare; and when it is higher on the in-side, it will make a horse straddle, so that a faire smooth table is of all most conuenient. After trauell euer stoppe the in-side of the hoofe with cowes dung, and rubbe the out-side and the cronet with the sward of fat bacon: for that will keepe a tough, smooth, and a sound hoofe.</p>

                     <p>A Hoofe is sayd to bee loosened when there is a dissolution or parting of the horne or coffin of the hoofe from the flesh, at the setting on of the
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:26941:197"/>
cronet. Now if this dissolution or parting bee round about the cronet, then it proceedeth by meanes of some foundring; but if it bee but in part, then it proceedeth from the anguish caused ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the pricking of some canell naile, or other naile piercing the soale, or quarters of the foote; or by some quitterbone, retraite, grauelling, or cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or such like accident. The signes of the disease be these: When it is loosened by foundring, then it will breake first, and the dissolution will appeare on the fore part of the cronet right against the toe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the humour doth couet alwayes to descend towards the toe; but if it proceede from pricking, grauelling, or such like, then the hoofe will loosen round about, equally euen at the first; but when it proceedes from some quitterbone, or hurt vpon the cronet, then the hoofe will breake right aboue the place that is offended, and most commonly will go no further. Now the cure, according to the opinion of the ancient Farriers, is, of what cause soeuer the loose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning proceed, first to be sure to open the hoofe in the soale of the foot, so as the humor may haue free pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage downeward; and then to binde about the toppe of it, the restrictiue plaister spoken of in the 97. chapter, and in the 100. chapter, and in such sort, as it is there written, and then heale it vp with tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine and hogges grease molten together. Others of the ancient Farriers take three spoonefull of tarre, and a quarter of a pound of rosen, and halfe a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of tansie, and halfe an handful of rew, and halfe an handfull of red mints, and halfe an handfull of sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thernwood, and bray all these together in a mortar: then adde halfe a pound of butter, and a penyworth
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:26941:198"/>
of virgine waxe, then melt them all together ouer the fire vntill it come to a thicke plaister or salue, then spread some of it vpon a cloth, and lay it to the soare, renewing it once a day for seauen daies, and it will heale it. Others vse to take the braines of a swine or a pig, and to stop his hoofe very wel therewith, three daies together, renewing it twice or thrice a day; and it will grow fast, and endure as well, or rather bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then euer it did. Other Farriers vse to cut out the sole below, letting it bleed well; after stop it with hurds dipt in the whites of egs, tye this to for twenty foure howers, then wash it with strong vinegar war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, after fill it with tartar, and salt of each a like quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, let that remaine in 2 daies; then annoint it with the oyntment made of <hi>Olibanum,</hi> masticke, pitch of Greece, of each a like, and a little <hi>Sanguis draconis,</hi> and of new waxe, and sheepes suet as much as of the first, and melte, and boyle them all very well toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and let this oyntment be applyed once a day till the soare be whole. But if you perceiue that any new hoofe come, then cut away the old, lest the hardnesse of the one hinder the tendernesse of the other; and then annoynt the new hoofe with suet, oyle, &amp; waxe, of each a like boyled together, to make it grow; or else with pitch of Greece, mastick, <hi>Olibanum, Sanguis draco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uis,</hi> &amp; <hi>Galbanum,</hi> of each alike, being molten with suet: for this will make the new hoofe to grow also, so will also new waxe, hony, oyle, swines grease, and sheeps suet, being boyled together; and when it is cold adde masticke, <hi>Sanguis draconis,</hi> and Frankensence, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate them all together; for nothing sooner then this will make either new or old hoofe grow. Others vse to take shell snailes and stampe them, and lay them

twice a day to the soare, and they will either fasten the old hoofe, or quickly bring foorth a new. Now there bee other Farriers which first fill the soare with turpentine, and after it hath laine twenty foure how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, then wash the soare with vrine or copporas water; then fill it either with verdigrease, or with sheepes tallow, pitch, and rosen boyld together, in which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing dipt hurdes lay it to the soare very hot twice a day vntill it be whole.</p>

                     <p>THe hoofe-bound is nothing else but a shrinking in of the whole hoofe in the vpper parte thereof, making the skinne to stare aboue the hoofe, and to grow ouer the same. It proceedeth from keeping the horses hoofes too dry in the stable, or from straite shooing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or from some vnnaturall heate after foundring; and the signes of the disease are, that the horse will halt much, and his hoofes will be hot; and if you knocke vpon them with an hammer, they will sound hollow like an empty bottle; and if both his feete bee not hoofe-bound, then the soare foote will euer be the lesser: and you shall also vnderstand that this disease of some Farriers is called a dry foundring. Now for the cure thereof according to the opinion of the ancient Farriers, it is thus, take a pound of the sward of bacon, and a quarterne of a pound of white sope, and a handfull of balme, and a handfull of bay leaues, and foure or fiue branches of rew, and stampe them well together; and then fry them, and lay them about the cronet of the hoofe very<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Other of the ancient Farriers vse, first to pull off his shooes, and to shooe him with halfe moone shooes called <hi>Lunets</hi> or <hi>Lunet,</hi> the shape whereof you shall see in an other place; then raze both the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the hoofe with a drawing knife, from the cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net vnto the sole of the foote, so deepe that you may see the dew come foorth: and if you make two razes

Now the cure, according to the opinion of the ancient Farri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, is thus: First take off the shooe, and pare away all the corrupt places, and make them raw, so as you may see the water issue out of the raw places: then

tacke on the shooe againe, being first made wide and large enough: that done, take of soote one handfull, of salte as much; bruise them well to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in a dish, and put thereto the whites of three egs, and temper them altogether; &amp; with a little <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Now for the signes, they are the apparance and palpable feeling of the knottes, which knottes are neuer but accompanyed with great swellings and rancklinges, running alongst as the veines runne,
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:26941:205"/>
and diuiding themselues as the braunches of the veines diuide, the number of the knottes multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying and encreasing vntill the body bee either v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuersally couered ouer, or else that the member (if it bee in a member) bee vtterly deformed and mishapen.</p>
                     <p>Now the cure, (according to the opinion of the ancient Farriers) is, first let him bloud on his necke veine, and on both his spurre veines: then giue the horse this drinke: Take a gallon of water, and put into it a good handfull or rewe, and a pound of hempe-seede, both being first bruised in a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar: then boyle them in the water till the one halfe bee consumed, and giue the horse this to drinke in the morning, fasting, being cold, for diuers mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninges together, and it will cure him. Others of the ancient Farriers vse first to let the horse bloud in that veine where the sorrance first riseth, as nigh the soare place as may bee, and let him bleede well: then fire or cauterize euery knotte one by one, taking the knotte in your left hand, and pulling it so hard as you can from his body, to the intent you may the better pierce the knotte with a round blunt hote Iron, of the bignesse of a mans forefin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, without doing the body any hurt, and let the matter out, leauing none vnburned, bee it little or much: that done, annoynt euery knotte so burned with hogges grease warmed euery day once vntill the coares bee ready to fall away; and in the meane time prepare a good quantity of old vrine, &amp; when you see the coares ready to fall, then boyle the vrine, and put therein a little copporas and salt, and a fewe strong nettles, and with that water being warme,
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:26941:205"/>
wash out all the coares, and all the corruption: that done, fill euery hole immediatly with the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of sleckt lime, continuing thus to do euery day once vntill the holes bee closed vp; and if any bee more ranker then others, fill those with verdigrease; and during this cure let the horse bee thinly dyet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that is to say, with straw and water onely, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse it be now and then to giue him a loafe of bread, or a little other prouender: for the lower hee is kept in flesh, the sooner hee will heale; and in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wise let his necke either bee yoaked in an old bottomlesse paile, or else splented with the staues in such sort that hee may not come to licke any of his soares, and the lesse rest hee hath, the better will bee his amendment. Now there bee other later Farri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers which for this sorrance take a good quantity of mistellthoe, hony, and blacke sope, and boyle them very well in old vrine, and being very warme, wash your horse all ouer therewith, euery day once for the space of fiue or sixe dayes, and it will helpe it. Others vse to cut the horse two inches long, downe the forehead, and open it in the midst thereof on both sides two inches, and put therto a tampin made of the inner rinde of Elder barke which is greene, and looke that it lye crosse the cut: for so it will destroy all the venemous humour in his body, and it will heale him very perfectly hauing bene very oft appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Others vse to take a very sharpe bodkin, and to thrust it crosse-wise through the neather part of the horses nose, euen through the small gristle, so that he may bleed well, or else to let him bloud in the necke veine, then feele the knots, and as many as are sort, lance them and let them run: then take strong lye,

lime and allom, and mixing them well together bathe all the soare <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now there be other Farriers which after the putting in of the rootes, as is aforesaid, vse to burne all the soare places round about with a hote yron; and then with another blunt hote yron as bigge as a mans fingar, to burne the soares in the midst till the white matter come foorth; then with a paire of pinsons plucke out the knots: this done, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynt all the soare places with sope, and then dresse him no more the space of foure or fiue daies, in which time you must prepare a good quantity of strong pisse, with the which you must wash him euery day, the pisse being first made scalding hote, and rubbe

Now when by this practise you haue cured the disease, if then the member bee vnfashionable, or by swellings out of all forme, then you shall lay vnto the member a plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster made of wine lees, and wheate flower, &amp; rolle it with a wollen roller, renewing it once in twenty toure howres till the member bee asswaged; and this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:26941:207"/>
will heale any greate sweld legge, if it be applied and continued with patience; but if by former dressings, burnings, manglings, or cuttings of some ignorant Farriers, there be any extraordinary hard or horny substance growne about the member which the plaister aforesaid will not resolue; then you shall take of virgine waxe halfe a pound, of mirrhe one pound, of raysins a pound, of <hi>Galbanum</hi> halfe a pound, of <hi>Costus</hi> sixe ounces, of armoniarcke sixe ounces, of swines grease two pounds; put your swines grease first into an earthen pot, and hauing placed it in a broad cauldron full of water, then make a soft fire vnder it, to the end that your water may boyle; and when you do perceiue your swines grease is almost melted, then shall you put in all your other simples, except the <hi>Costus</hi>: and when they are all molten, which will aske fiue or sixe howres boyling at the least, then your <hi>Costus,</hi> which is a white roote, being beaten into fine powder, you shall adde to the aforesaid things af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is taken from the fire, and incorporate them all very well together; then make a plaister thereof vpon a peece of sheepes leather, somewhat bigger then the soare, and this plaister without renewing will serue for at least thirty daies with a very little refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, onely you must once a day take it off, and rub his legge very well, for feare it itch, which may cause the horse to beate and stamped with his foote, and so rather increase then decrease the swelling; and you must regard, that you doe not rolle him to straite, for that is most hurtfull. It shall not be a misse now and then to ride him into the water, and walke him an howre after; then bringing him into the stable, rubbe his legge well; then warme his plaister ouer a chafing-dish

Now there be other Farriers which for this farcy if it bee but young, and especially if it bee about the head or face of a horse; will take onely of aqua vitae two spoonefuls, of the iuice of garlicke two spoone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and of the iuice of rew, or hearb of grace, two spoonefull; mixe them well together, then take ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gants or round bals of flaxe, and steepe them therein, and then stoppe them hard into the horses eares; then take a needle and thred, and stitch the tips of his two eares together, by meanes whereof he cannot shake out the medicine, and vse the horse thus three seuerall mornings together, and it will kill the farcy as hath beene oft proued. Other Farriers vse to take drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worts, or groundsell, and beate it well in a mortar with white salt, and then stop it hard into the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses eares, and so either stitch them together, or with a broad inckle bind them vp; renewing it once in foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene howres for three or foure dressings, and it will heale any reasonable farcy. Others vse to annoynt all the soares either with tansey and verdiuice boyld together, or else with boares grease very hote, and that will kill it. Others vse first to wash the soares with old vrine, then take the powder of glasse, brimstone, and hogges grease well stamped and beaten together; then opening or slitting the knotes annoynt them all therwith, and it wil cure them immediatly; Other Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers vse to let the horse blood if it be at the beginning of the disease, or else not; &amp; then to burne all the knots as is aforesaid, &amp; then to heale the burnings with tar, oyle &amp; hony mixt together, &amp; giue him with a pint of
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:26941:208"/>
malmsey, two or three spoonfull of the powder <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pente</hi>: or else giue him 4 ounces of the powder of wal-wort, or dan-wort, with a pint &amp; a halfe of malmsey, 3. daies together; after that, take an ounce of <hi>Aloes,</hi> one ounce of <hi>Centuary,</hi> one ounce of <hi>Opoponax</hi>; beat them all into sine powder, and giue them him to drinke in a pint and an halfe of malmsey warmed, wherein the roots of the aforesaid hearbe called wal-wort, or dan-wort, haue bene sodden: vse to ride him oft vntill he sweate; and when the disease is killed, turne him to grasse: for running in the open aire is very wholsome. There be others which take blacke sope, <hi>Arsnicke,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleckt lime, verdigrease, &amp; red lead; work all these well together, and opening the knots, dresse them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with till you see they begin to dry vp and dy. Others open the knots with a hot Iron, and then take blacke sope, &amp; great salt beaten together, and halfe so much as of them of verdigrease, and boyle the verdigrease with fresh grease, and then take a saucerful of mustard, and put them all together, and dresse the soares there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. Others take<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ounces of quicksiluer, and put it into a bladder, with 2 spoonfull of the iuice of oren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges or lemons, and shake them together to coole the quicksiluer: then take halfe a pound of fresh hogges grease, &amp; of verdiuice an ounce; put all these in a trend dish, &amp; worke them well together: then annoynt the knots with this oyntment, till they rot: then let them out with a sharpe knife, &amp; annoynt them still, and put into his eares the iuice of rag-weed, and the soares wil dry vp. This medicine is very well approued. Others take blacke sope, mustard made of wine vinegar, and red lead; mixe all these together, &amp; anoynt the veine all along, holding a hote Iron close to the soare,
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:26941:208"/>
to make the oyntment sinke in; &amp; do thus once a day vntil the soares dry vp. Other Farriers take of the iuice of hemlocke a good quantity, &amp; dipping tow therein, stop his eares therewith: then open all the knots and thrust in salt. Lastly, giue him to drinke sweete worte mixt with fennell &amp; treacle. Other Farriers take the butter burre, and being dryed &amp; beaten to powder, strew it vpon the knots after they haue bin opened, &amp; then giue him 2. or 3. spoonfull of the same powder with a pint of malmesey to drinke, &amp; it will cure the Farcy, and it is also exceeding good for all manner of vlcers; the root is strong in smell, &amp; bitter in taste. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers take sulphure, orpiment, vnslekt lime, and mixing them together, put it into the knots, and it will kill the Farcy: which done, annoynt him with bolearmony made into powder, &amp; incorporated with strong vinegar, the iuice of houslicke, and of white leekes, and <hi>Solatro.</hi> Other Farriers after they haue let the horse bloud will boyle in vinegar, beane flowre &amp; swines grease, then adde a prety quantity of oyle; and then straine it, then adde one part of aloes, &amp; two of brimstone, &amp; boyle it a little: then being warme an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynt all the soare places therewith, or else annoynt them twice a day with the iuice of smallage, and the yelkes of egges beaten together. There be other Farri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers which take 2 ounces of oyle de bay, one of <hi>Eufor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bium,</hi> &amp; 2 ounces of arsnicke; &amp; mixing them together, annoynt the soares therewith, &amp; it will kill the Farcy. Now after all these many receipts, of which not any but hath bene approued to be very good, yet these 2. which I wil now rehearse, I haue euer found to be the most excellent for any manner of Farcy whatsoeuer, whether it be, as our simple Smithes tearme it, a drye
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:26941:209"/>
Farcy, a wet or water Farcy, or a running Farcy, all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indeed but one Farcy, &amp; proceeding from one &amp; the selfe same cause; only some horses not hauing such flux of humors in them as others haue, the knots will be vnwilling to breake, and then they say it is a drye farcy: others of the contrary part will breake as fast as the knots do arise, and run filthy matter; and then they call it a water farcy: others will spread in many parts of the body, yet not breake, but as it were moue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the skin &amp; the flesh, and that they call a run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning farcy. Now all these, as I said before, are but one farcy, and haue but one certaine cure, which is this: first, with diligent heed marke vpon what principall veine in the horses body the knots do arise, and note how they spread &amp; run; then if the farcy bee diuided into sundry branches, according as the veine doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide, you shall take the last knot of euery braunch, which, for the most part, will be hard, and not come to rottennesse; and then slit them, and fill them with your kniues point full of white arsnicke: then those which you find to be rotten, let the matter forth, and annoynt them with blacke sope and arsnicke mixt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: then within 2. or 3. dayes you shall see those which you drest with arsnicke simply, to haue their coares fall out, and the rest which you drest with blacke sope, will dry vp: then annoynt them all with fresh butter molten till they be whole. Now if you do perceiue any new knots to arise, then you shall dresse them likewise with arsnicke simply, as was said before, &amp; not leaue any vncured. Now if the farcy be not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry contagious, but, as it were, newly begun, then if you only take blacke sope &amp; arsenicke, as beforesayd, and annoynting your fingar and your thumbe
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:26941:209"/>
therewith, do but nippe and bruise euery knot, and within two or three daies after, they will dry vp and heale. But if the farcy be fowle and desperate, that is to say, either vniuersally spread ouer the body, or so gotten into any limbe or member, that the limbe is deformed, and hath lost his proportion, so that a man can neither iudge which way the veines runne, nor in what part the knots are most venemous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that healing one, two new ones will arise; In this case you shall first giue your horse a strong scou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring or purgation, according to the strength of his body, of all which a pint of muskadine, or a quart of strong ale, with halfe a pinte of the oyle of oates, is the most soueraigne: then shall you take a peny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth of tarre, and two good handfuls of pidgions dung, and twelue penyworth of white mercury; mixe all these very well together, and make them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a salue: then with a slice daube it all ouer the soare place, leauing no parte of the member vnco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered: then heating a barre of Iron red hote, hold it so neare that it may drye the salue vpon the soare: then lay more fresh salue on, and dry it in like maner, &amp; let it so rest vntill it fall off, and it will kill any farcy whatsoeuer at the first or second dressing. Now there bee others which will stoppe the knots with the powder of verdigrease and of arsnicke mixt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, or else wash the soares with <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> but they are neither so good as the other before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsed.</p>

                     <p>A Canker is a poysonous creeping vlcer, fretting &amp; gnawing the flesh in great breadth, whose be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning is knotty, not much vnlike vnto the farcy, &amp; spreadeth it selfe into diuers places: and being exul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerated, gathereth together at the length into one wound or filthy soare; from whence there runneth a thinne sharpe lye, which galleth off the skin where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer it goes; and so both increaseth the vlcer, and maketh it more incurable. It proceedeth from me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy and filthy bloud, ingendred either by ranck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of keeping, or else by too extreme pouerty; and if this naughty bloud be mixt with sharpe and salte humors, then it causeth more painefull and grieuous exulceration. It also may proceede from some loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some wound which is neither cleane kept, nor well drest, but in such sorte that the corrupt matter thereof poysoneth the other cleane partes of the body; for signes of the sorrance, there needeth no more but the description already mentioned. And for the cure, according to the opinion of ancient Farriers, is, first to let the horse bloud, in those veines which are next the soare, and make him bleed well; then take of allom halfe a pound, of greene copporas as much, of white copporas one quarterne, and a good handfull of salt; boyle all these things together in faire running water from a pottle to a quart: and this water being warme, wash the soare therewith with a clout: and then sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle thereon the powder of slecked lime, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so to doe euery day once the space of fifteene

And if it leaue spreading, and that you see the rancke flesh is well mortified, and that the edges beginnes to gather a skinne, then after the washing dresse it with lime, as before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> continuing so to doe vntill it be whole; and in the dressing suffer no filth that commeth out of the soare, to remaine vpon any whole place about, but wipe it cleane away, or else wash it away with warme water: and let the horse during this cure, bee as thinly dicted as may bee, and throughly exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; now if this cankerous vlcer happen to be in the taile of the horse, as it is often seene, and which you shall perceiue as well by the falling away of the haire, as also by the wound, then you shall make a bolster either of soft cloth, or spunge, and wet it with vinegar both within and without, and so bind it fast to the soare; &amp; alwaies when it waxeth dry you must wet it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; do thus twice or thrice a day, if it be done ofte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner it is better: so shal you continue for three or foure daies, and then heale it vp, as you heale vp any ordinary wound; that is with hogges grease and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine molten together, or such like.

deale straiter at the mouth then at the bottome, being ingendred in some wound, soare, bruise, or canker not throughly healed. The signes to know it are, the hollownesse of the soare, descending downewarde from the orifice, and the thinnesse of the matter which issueth from the same; besides, the crookednes which you shall finde in the vlcer when you search it. Now for the cure, according to the opinion of the ancient Farriers it is thus: first search the bottome thereof with a goose or swannes quill, or with a small rodde, well couered with fine linnen cloth; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing found the bottome thereof, cut it so large with a razor that the matter may haue free passage downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; but take heed in launcing it, that you cut not any master sinew or maine tendant: then hauing stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the blood either with swines dung or such like, take of good hony a pint, of verdigease one ounce, &amp; boyle them well together vpon a soft fire three quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of an howre; then hauing cleansed the soare by tying a taint of flaxe or fine linnen cloth to the point of your quill, with a threed draw it softly into the wound: then cut off your quill, or feather so long that you may take good hold in the neather end of the tent, which then shall come out at the bottome of your soare: then dip another tent in the aforesaid salue, and then with a needle &amp; a thred, make fast your tent to your first clout at the vpper end thereof; then draw out your first tent downeward, so shal you draw your tent with the medicine easily into the wound, and your first tent will haue cleansed the soare very cleane; &amp; if the matter do abound much, then it shall be good to dresse him twice a day, but you must not dresse him with this medicine, no more but one day,
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:26941:213"/>
and afterward you shal dresse him with this medicine following: Take of turpentine, of swine grease, of hony, and sheeps suet, of each a like quantity, &amp; melt them together, and make a salue thereof, wherewith you shal dresse your horse foure daies for one day that you dresse him with your former medicine made of hony and verdigrease; and take heede that you make your tent of very soft linnen cloath, or fine flaxe, and let not your tent be too big after the first and second time dressing, but presently after the first dressing, you must couer the soare place, &amp; round about the same, with this <hi>Pultus</hi> here following: First, take two gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons of faire water, and hauing boyled and scummed it so long till you haue perfectly cleansed it of all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, then take two or three handfuls of mallowes, and as much of violet leaues, and two or three hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls of oat-meale, and hauing boyled all these 3. things well in your former prepared water, you shall adde thereto of hogges mort, and fresh butter, of each a pound: then shall you let it boyle so long till it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come thicke, like paste, or pap, and then apply it hot to the soare; and take heed that in opening this soare you let not any aire strike into it: and on the other side, that you keep it not too hot. And if this fistula be in the horses withers, you must take heede that you ty his head to the racke so as he may neitherly down, nor put his head lower then his manger: for if you suffer him to feede on the ground when he hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny grieuous soare in his withers, it shal hardly be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible euer to cure him; but if you perceiue the wound to heale apace, and that it matter but a little, then shall it be enough to dresse him once a day: and also it shall be good to take great heed that you make not

Now there be others of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Farriers which vse for this cure, first to search the depth of the fistula either with a quill, or with some other instrument of lead, which may be bowed euery way: for vnlesse you finde the bottome of it, it will bee very hard to cure: and hauing found the bottome, if it be in such a place as you may boldly cut and make the way open with a launcet or razor, then make a slit right against the bottome, so wide, that you may thrust in your fingar to feele whether there be any bone or else gristle perished, or spungy or loose flesh, which must bee gotten out; and then taint it with a taint of flaxe dipped in this oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Take of <hi>Mirre,</hi> of <hi>Aloes,</hi> and of <hi>Sarcocolla,</hi> of each one ounce, of good hony sixe ounces, and of verdigrease two ounces, and melt all these on a gentle fire, and make them into a salue; then being luke warme, dresse the taint therewith, and bolster the tent with a bolster of flaxe, and if it be in such a place as the tent cannot conueniently be kept in with a band, then fasten on each side the hole, two ends of a shooe-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers threed right ouer the bolster to keepe in the tent, which ends may hang there as two laces to ty and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at your pleasure, renewing the tent euery day once vntill the soare leaue mattering, and then make the tent euery day lesser and lesser vntill it bee whole: for you shall vnderstand that this salue doth purge this fistula of putrifaction; incarnateth &amp; breedeth flesh; conglutinateth, and eateth away all naughty flesh. Now when you haue done as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, then you shal close it vp by sprinckling thereon a little sleckt lime: but if the fistula bee in such a place
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:26941:214"/>
as a man can neither cut against the bottome, nor nigh the same: then there is no remedy but euery time you dresse it, to powre into it either through some quill, or by some small squirt or serring, some strong white copporas water, or some allome water, so that it may goe downe to the bottome, and drye vp the filthy matter: and this you must doe twice a day at least vntill it bee whole. Now there bee of our later Farriers which vse this cure, after they haue searcht the Fistula to the bottome, to take a pottle of white wine vinegar, of cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaire halfe an ounce, of mercurie precipitate halfe an ounce, of greene treacl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now if you intend to sinke downe the swelling of a fistu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la, first of all seare it with a drawing yron in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion <figure/>, and then take rosen, sheepes suet, &amp; brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone,

and boyle them together, and lay it vpon a fistula very hot with a cloth: and it will sinke downe the swelling. It is also most excellent to take away a windgall if it bee laid on after the windgall is prickt, but not too hote, but very reasonable, and it will keep it also very cleane. There bee other Farriers which for a fistula take verdigrease, butter, and salt, melted together, and poure it scalding hote into the soare, and vse this till all the flesh looke redde; then taint it with verdigrease, burnt allome, wheate flowre, and the yelks of egges well beaten and mingled together: last of all, skinne it with barme and soote mixt together. Other Farriers take of that <hi>Resagallo</hi> that is made of orpiment, vnsleckt lime, and brimston, and it will kill a fistula being applied vnto the bottome; yet it is a strong corrosiue, and desireth much descretion in the administration.</p>

Now the cure, according to the opinion of the ancient Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers is, 1. to tye it about with a threed, so hard as you can pull it, and the threed will eate in by little and little, in such sort as within seuen or eight daies it will fall away of it selfe; &amp; if it be so flat that you can bind nothing about it, then take it away with a sharpe hote yron cutting it round about, and so deepe as you leaue none of the roote behind, and then dry it vp

                     <p>VVOunds, according to the opinion of all Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers, is a solution, diuision, or parting of the whole: for if there be no such solution or diuision, then it is rather called a bruise then a wound; and therefore wounds are most commonly made with sharpe or piercing weapons, and bruises with blunt weapons: notwithstanding if by such blunt weapons any part of the whole bee euidently broken, then it is to bee called a wound as well as the other; and these wounds do proceed from some stroke, pricke, or violent accident. Now of wounds some bee hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and some bee deepe and hollow: againe, some wounds chance in fleshy parts, and some in bony &amp; sinewy places: and those which chance in the fleshy parts, though they be very deepe, yet they bee not so dangerous as the others, and therefore I will speake first of the most dangerous. If then a horse haue a wound newly made, either in his head, or in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place that is full of sinewes, bones, or gristles, then according to the opinion of the most ancient Farri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, you shall first wash the wound well with white wine warmed, and keepe it euer whilest you are in dressing it, couered with cloathes wet in warme white wine: that done, you shall search the bottome of the wound with a probe, or small instrument of
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:26941:218"/>
steele made for the purpose, suffering the wound to take as little winde or aire as you can possible: then hauing found the depth, stoppe the hole close with a cloute vntill your salue bee ready: then take of turpentine, of <hi>Melrosatum,</hi> oile of roses, of each a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne, and a little vnwrought waxe, and melt them together, stirring them continually that they may bee well mingled together; and if the wound bee a cut, make a handsome rolle or round plegant of soft tow, so long and so bigge as may fill the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the wound, which, for the most part, is not so wide as the mouth of the wound: then make an other rolle or plegant somewhat bigger to fill vp the rest of the wound, euen to the hard mouth, and let both these rolles bee annoynted with the oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment aforsayd made luke warme; onely this you must euer obserue, that if the wound bee long and large, that then it is best, if you can conueniently, to stitch the wound together with a needle and a crimson silke: for that will make it heale the sooner, and make the scarre lesse. But if the hurt bee like a hole made with some pricke, then make a stiffe tent either of tow or lint, such a one as may reach the bottome, annoynted with the aforesaid oyntment, and bolster the same with a little tow; and ouer both this &amp; the other, or any wound whatsoeuer, assoone as your rolles, plegants, or tents, are put in, you shal clap a sticking plaister made of pitch, rosen, masticke, and turpentine melted together, as hath bene before taught, both to keepe in your salue, and to comfort the soare. Now if the mouth of the wound bee not wide inough, so as the matter may easily runne forth, if it be in such a place as you may do it without hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:26941:219"/>
any sinew: then giue it a pretty slit from the mouth downward, that the matter may haue the freer passage, and in any wise haue an especiall regard that the tent may bee continually kept in by one means or other, and also that it may not be drowned within the wound, but by tying some threed about the vpper end thereof, so kept that it may bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out at pleasure. Now if the hole bee deep, &amp; in such a place as you may not cut it, then make your tent full as bigge as the hole, of a drye sponge that was neuer wet, so long that it may reach the bottome; and the tent being made somewhat full, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall turning and wrying of it, you shall easily get it downe, &amp; then dresse the wound with this twice a day, cleansing the wound euery time with a little white wine luke warme: for this sponge annoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the oyntment aforesayd, will both draw and sucke vp all the filthy matter, and make it so faire within as is possible; and as it beginneth to heale, so make your tent euery day lesser and lesser vntill it be ready to close vp, and neuer leaue tainting it so long as it will receiue a taint, bee it neuer so short: for hasty healing of wounds breedeth fistulaes, which properly bee old soares, and therefore must bee hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led like fistulaes. Now if the wound proceed from any ancient impostumation, then you shall take two or three great onyons, and taking out the coares, put therein a little baysalt, and a litle whole saffron, and so roast them in the hote embers: then plaister-wise lay them all hote on the wound, renewing it once a day till the wound bee healed. Now if the vpper skinne of the wound bee putrified, and you would haue it away, then make a plaister of
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:26941:219"/>
cowes dung sodde in milke, and clappe it to for foure and twenty howres, and it will leaue nothing that is vile about the wound. Other Farriers vse generally for any cut whatsoeuer, to take a quarter of a pound of fresh butter, of tarre and blacke sope, of each halfe so much, and a little turpentine; boyle all but the sope together: then when you take it from the fire, put in the sope, and with this oyntment dresse any cut, and it will heale it. Others vse onely to take hogs grease and Venice turpentine and to melt them together, and it will heale any wound. Other Farriers take eight drammes of turpentine, foure drammes of new virgin-waxe; melt them in a pew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vessell, and stirre them well together, and when they are well melted and mixed, take them from the fire, and by and by whilest they be hot, powre into them halfe a pint of white wine, then after they be cold throw away the wine, and annoynt your hands with oyle of roses, and worke the waxe &amp; turpentine well together: after that put them into the pewter ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel againe: then put to them halfe an ounce of the gum of fir-tree, &amp; three drammes of the iuice of bettony: then seeth them well together vntill the iuice of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony be wasted: then put to it 3. drams of womans milke, or the milke of a red cow, and seeth them once againe vntill the milke be wasted; and then put it in a close pot or glasse, and with this dresse any wound whatsoeuer, &amp; it will heale it. Others vse to take rose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary, &amp; dry it in the shadow, and beate it to powder, then wash the wound with vinegar, or the vrine of a child, &amp; strew thereon the aforesaid powder, &amp; it will heale any indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t wound.

them all into fine powder, then take waxe and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes grease, and boyle them on a soft fire, vntill they bee as thicke as an ointment or salue; with this dresse any wound and it will heale it. Others vse to take the toppes of nettles, butter, and salt, and beating them well in a mortar till it come to a salue, and it will draw and heale a wound.

Take turpentine, hony, hogges grease, waxe, and sheepes suet, of each a like, melt them well together to a salue, and they will heale any wound. Now if a horse be goared vpon a stake, then you shall cast him, and powre into the wound butter scalding hote, and so let him lye till it be gone downe into the bottome, and doe thus once a day, till the wound be whole.

                     <p>ALL bruisings and swellings come vnto a horse either by accident, as by some blow, rush, pinch;

or outward venoming; or else naturally, as through the fluxe of cold or hote humors; or through the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of blood, or through the aboundance of winde. The signes are, the sightly apparance in what place or member soeuer they be: and the first, which are those which come by accident, are properly called bruisings or swellings; and the other if they do rotte or corrode, and so turne to matter, are called impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stumes. Now for the generall cure of any bruise or swelling, according to the opinion of the ancient Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers it is thus, take of dry pitch, of gumme, of each an ounce; of <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banum,</hi> of lime, of each foure ounces, of <hi>Bitumen</hi> two ounces, of waxe three ounces; melt and boyle them very well together: then annoynt the soare place therewith once a day, and it will heale it. But if the swelling proceede onely from some bruise or rush, then you shall take two pints of verdiuice, one pint of barme, and putting a little fine hay there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into, boyle them very well together, then bind the hay to the swelling very hote, and after powre on the liquor: doe thus three or foure daies together, and it will take away the swelling. Other Farriers take the toppes of wormewood, pellitory of the wall; <hi>Branck vrsnie,</hi> beate them well together with swines grease, then seeth them; then adde a pretty quantity of hony, lin-seed oyle, and wheate meale; then stirre it ouer the fire till all againe be sodden together, then lay it to the swelling, and renew it once a day till the swelling bee goe. Other Farriers vse first, to pricke the swelling with a fleame: then take of wine lees a pinte, as much wheate flowre as will thicken it and an ounce of comen; boyle them together, and lay this somewhat warme vnto it, renewing it euery day
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:26941:221"/>
once vntill the swelling, either depart or else come to a head, which if it doe not, then launce it, and heale it according to a wound. Other Farriers take of rosen, of turpentine, and of hony, of each halfe a pound, dissolue them at the fire: then straine them, and adde of myrrhe, <hi>Sarcocoll,</hi> and the flowre of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negreeke, and of lin-seed oyle, of each an ounce, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate them altogether, &amp; then make it thicke like a salue, with the meale of lupins, and lay it to the swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and it will asswage it.

If you take onely rotten litter, or hay boyld in strong vrine, and apply it dayly vnto any swelling, it will take it away. Now if the swelling be vpon the legs, and come by any straine, then you shall take of nerue-oyle one pound, of blacke sope one pound, of boa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>IMpostumes are a gathering, or knitting together of many most corrupt humors in any part or member of the body, making that part to swell extremely, &amp; growing into such violent infla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mation that in the end they rot &amp; breake out into foule, mattery, and running soares: they commonly proceed either from corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of foode, or corruption of bloud; they are at the first appearance, very hard &amp; very soare; which hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is the principall signe that they will rot. And of these impostumes, some be hot impostumes, and some be cold; yet forasmuch as euery impostume must first be ripened and brought to matter before it can bee healed, we will first speake of the ripening of them. If therefore you will ripen an impostume (according to the opinion of the ancient Farriers) you shall take

Other Farriers take swines grease, red waxe, and the flowre of <hi>Euforbium,</hi> and mixing them on the fire well together, lay it to the impostume, and it will do the like.

Other Farriers take barley meale, and boyle it with wine and pidgions dung, and so lay it to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postume plaister-wise, and it will ripen exceedingly. Other Farriers take a handfull or two of sorrell, and lapping it in a docke leafe, roast it in the hot embers as you would roast a warden, and then lay it to the impostume as hot as may be, renewing it once a day, and it will ripen, breake, and heale. A plaister of shooe-makers waxe will doe the like also. Other Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers take mallow roots, and lilly rootes, &amp; then bruise them, and put thereto hogges grease, &amp; linseed meale, and plaisterwise lay it to the impostume, and it will ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen it, breake it, and heale it perfectly.</p>

                     <p>FIrst before wee speake of the order of taking vp of veines, you shal vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that al veines except the neck veines, the eie veynes, the breast veine, the palate veines, and the spurre veines, are to bee taken vp, and not stricken with the fleame; partly because they bee so little and thinne, that if you strike them you shall either indanger the striking thorrow them; or partly because they are so neere adioyning to arteries and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes, that if in striking you should hit and pricke ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther artery or sinewe, it were a persent laming of the horse, as I haue oftentimes seene and noted in the practise of many ignorant smiths. Now touching the
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:26941:236"/>
order of taking vp of a veine, it is thus. First you shall cast your horse either vpon some soft ground, grasse, some dunghill that is not very moist, or in some light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some house, vpon good store of sweete straw; then when the horse is thus cast, you shall looke for the veine which you intend to take vp, and if it be either so small, or lye so deepe, that you can hardly perceiue it; then you shall with warme water, rubbe, chafe &amp; bathe all that part where the veine lyeth; then take a narrow silke garter, and a handfull or two aboue the veine (if it bee of any of the horses legs) garter the member very strait; but if it bee a veine to be taken vp on the body, or breast; then with a sufringle ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther close behinde the hinder point of the shoulder, or within a handfull of the place, where you meane to take vp the veine, gird him very straite, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently you shall see the veine to arise; then marke that part of the skinne which couereth the veine, and with your fingar and your thumbe, pull it some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what aside from the veine, and then with a very fine incision-knife slit the skinne cleane through, without touching the veine, and in any wise cut no deeper then through the skinne, and that longwise too, in such sort as the veine goeth, yet not aboue an inch at the most in length: that done, remoue your finger and your thumbe and the skinne will returne againe into his place, right ouer the veine as it was before, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that but opening the orifice, or slir, you shall see the veine lye blew, and bare before your eyes; then take a fine smooth corner made either of the browantler of a stag, or of an old bucke, and thrust it vnderneath the veine, and lift it vp a prety distance (that is to say, halfe the thicknes of the cornet) aboue
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:26941:237"/>
the skinne; that done, you shall then loose either the garter or the sursingle, for they are but onely helpes for you to find out the veine; and where the veine will appeare without them, there by no meanes you shall vse them. Now when you haue thus taken your veine vpon your cornet, you shall then either put a redde silke threed, dipt in oyle, or butter, or else a small shoomakers threed, vnderneath the veine also, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what higher then the cornet, which silke or threed must serue to knit the veine when time requires; then the cornet standing still as before, with your kinfe slit the toppe of the veine longwise, the length of a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly corne, that it may bleed; then stopping the neather part of your veine with the silke or threed, suffer it to bleed well from aboue; then with your silke or threed remoued aboue, knit it fast with a sure knot aboue the slit suffering it onely to bleed from beneath, and hauing bleed there also sufficiently, then knit vp the veine beneath the slit with a sute knot; then fill the hole of the veine with salt, and heale vp the wound of the skinne with turpentine and hogges grease mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten together, or else with a little fresh butter, laid on with a little flaxe or tow. Now the vertue which redounds from this taking vp of veines, first it is very necessary, and doth ease all grieues, straines, and stif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the limbs; for the taking vp of the plat veins easeth al paines in the breast, and grieues in the chest; the taking vp of the fore-thigh veines easeth farcies, and swellings of the legges; the taking vp of the shackle veines before, helpeth gourding, quitter bones, and the swelling of the ioynts, scabbes, and scratches; the taking vp of the hinder hough-veines, helpeth spauens of both kinds, most especially any
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:26941:237"/>
farcy in those parts, and generally all swellings or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postumes; the taking vp of the pastorne veines behind helpeth swellings about the cronet, or neather ioints, Paines, mules and all manner of kibed heeles, besides sundry other such like diseases.</p>

                     <p>THe giuing of fire which amongst the best Farri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers is called cauterizing, and amongst the simpler, burning, searing, or blistering, is (according to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall opinion of all the most ancientest Farriers) the chiefest remedy, and as it were the last refuge of all diseases incident to any horses body, whether they be naturall or accidentall; for the violence of fire se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating and disgesting all manner of humors, into a thinne aire, and loose body, cleanseth and auoydeth those grosnesses which are the materiall causes of all putrifaction, and vlceration.

Now the first of these, which is the cautery actuall, is principally to be vsed when there is any appostumation in any si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newie part or member, or amongst any of the most principall veines: also when you shall dismember or cut away any ioynt, or make any incision where there is feare of any fluxe of blood, or
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:26941:238"/>
where you shall finde either the skinne or muscles shrunke or straitned, and in many such like cases.

                        </gap>lemish that can any way be found in cautery, is, that it commonly leaueth a great scarre, which is many times an eye-soare more then is tollerable; and therefore the vse of cauterizing is onely to be preferred but in despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate cases of great extremity; for albeit it worke foule, yet it is most certaine, it workes most sure. Now as touching the instruments wherewith you must cauterize, their substance, and proportion, you shall vnderstand that the most curious Farriers doe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre either gold or siluer to be the best mettal to make them of, in that few or no euill accidents doe follow where they burne: But the wisest, best, and most skilfullest Farriers take copper to be sufficient inough, and a mettal without any lawful exception; yet where copper instruments cannot be had, there you may, with commendations inough, vse such instruments as are made of iron, and finde your worke no deale at all hindered. Now for the fashion or proportion of your instruments or Irons, they are to be referred to the soare, or place grieued, wherewith you are to
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:26941:239"/>
meddle, according to the diuersity whereof your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments are to bee made of diuers fashions, as some are to bee made knife-wise, either with thinne edges, or broad edges; and they bee called drawing kniues, or searing kniues, because they are principally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the drawing of strait lines shallow, or deepe, and sometimes in circular or diuers squares: some are made like straite, and some like crooked bodkins, and they are imployed either in fleshy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cresions, to cause exulceration; or else in impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stumes to open small passages for the matter; some are made like hookes or sickles, and they are to bee vsed where the wound is crooked, for the burning out of dead flesh, or such like hidden euils, which cannot bee reacht by any straite instrument: others are made either with great buttons, or little buttons at the end; and they are vsed to open impostumes, or else to burne into the sound flesh where you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to make any new soare or issue for the drawing or keeping backe of other euil humors: and in making of these irons, the Farrriers owne iudgement is to be of great valew, because he must either increase and diminish them according to the manner of the place grieued; and be sure that he euer make them fit for his right purpose. Now for the vse of these instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, there are two principall things to bee regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: First, the heating of the iron, and next, the true temper, or bearing of the Farriers hand. Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the heating of the iron, you shall vnderstand, that the backe of the iron must neuer bee so hote as the edge, that is to say, you must neuer make the backe of the iron redde hote, for feare that thereby it yeeld too much heate, and so consequently breede
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:26941:239"/>
inflammation: therefore whensoeuer you see the backe of your iron as hote as the edge, you shall a little coole it with water. Now for the temper, or bearing of your hand, you shall vnderstand that the more euenly, and lightly it is done, so much the better it is done; and heerein is to bee considered, the finenesse or thicknesse of the horses skinne, which you shall know most commonly by his haire: for if it bee short and fine, then the skinne is thin; if it be long and rough, then is his skinne thicke and boysterous.</p>
                     <p>Now the skinne that is fine, must bee cauterized or feared with a very light hand, in as much as the skinne is soone pierced through, and the thicke skinne with a heauy hand, and both of them with such a tempered hand, that the skinne must no more but looke yellow; wherein you shall euer finde that the fine skinne will sooner looke yellow then the thicke skinne, the reason being, because the thicknesse and roughnesse of the haire of the thicke skinne doth coole and choake the heate of the Iron, insomuch that if it be not layd to with a more hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy hand, and the instrument so much the more and the oftener heated, it cannot worke that effect which in art it should do. Now you shal also obserue, that in drawing of any line or other cauterize whatsoeuer, that you euer draw with the haire, and neuer against the haire, whether the lines be short, long, deepe, shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, straight, crooked, or ouerthwart, according as the griefe doth require. Now to conclude, you are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue in cauterizing, these fewe precepts: First, that you doe not giue fire to any sinewie place, except there bee some apparant swelling, or else
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:26941:240"/>
impostumation; secondly, that you giue not fire to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bone that is broken, or out of ioynt, for feare of breeding a general weakenesse in the whole member. Thirdly, neuer to giue the fire so deepe, or suffer your hand to be so heauy, that you may either mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shape or deforme the horse, either by vnnecessary fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, or vncomly scarres. Thirdly, not to be too rash or hasty in giuing fire, as if euery cure were to be wrought by that practise onely (as I know some ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well reputed Farriers holde of opinion,) but onely to attempt all other good meanes before; and when all hope else is desperate, then to make the fire your last refuge, as an extremity that must preuaile when all other practises doe perish. Lastly, I would not haue you like those foolish Farriers which know nothing, vtterly to contemne and neglect it, as if it were vse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, but with all moderation and discretion to apply it in fit time and place, whereby the poore horse may gaine ease, your selfe good reputation, and the owner profite; which is most certaine, as long as you are gouerned by wisedome.</p>

<pb n="461" facs="tcp:26941:240"/>
and therefore are not to be administred, but to strong bodies, &amp; in very strong diseases; &amp; caustick, which is as much to say as burning, when the operation is so strong, that it inclineth, and commeth nearest to the nature of fire, and so burneth and consumeth what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer it toucheth. Now these potentiall cauterizes doe exceed and excell one another, by certaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, as thus, the corrosiues are weaker then the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifactiues, and the putrifactiues are weaker then the caustickes; the corrosiues worke vpon the vpper part in the soft flesh, the putrifactiues in the depth of the hard flesh; and the causticks haue power to breake skin sound or vnsound, both in hard and soft flesh, &amp; that very deepely also. Now of corrosiues, some bee sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and some bee compound; the simple corrosiues are, roach allome, burnt or vnburnt, the spung of the sea somewhat burnt, lime, redde corrall, powder of mercury, shauings of an oxe or harts horne, <hi>Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate,</hi> verdigrease, and such like: the compound corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siues are, blacke sope, and lime, <hi>Vnguentum Apostolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> and <hi>Vnguentum Aegyptiacum,</hi> and <hi>Vnguentum Ceraceum,</hi> and many such like; and these are to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied vnto soares, vlcers, or excressions, after they are corroded. The putrifactiues are arsnicke, either white or yellow, <hi>Sublimatum, Resalgar,</hi> or any medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine compounded with any of them; besides <hi>Sanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racha Chrysocollo,</hi> and <hi>aconitum.</hi> Now if you would haue your putrifactiue medicines to be crustiue, that is breeding a great scar, and hote in the fourth degree; then they are vnsleckt lime, and the burned dregges of wine; and these are to be vsed to carbunckles, cankers, and anburies. The causticke medicines are those which are made of strong lye, called <hi>Capitellum</hi> or <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistra,</hi>

                     <head>CHAP. 157. Of the rowelling of horses, and the vse thereof.</head>
                     <p>THe rowelling of horses is, amongst our ignorant and simple smiths, the most ordinary and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall practise of all other whatsoeuer, insomuch that not any disease can almost be found, about a horse either how sleight or great soeuer it be, but presently without any reason or sence therefore, they will ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well him for the same; whereby they not onely put the horse to a needlesse torment, but also bring down now and then such a fluxe of naughty humors, that they lame the horse which otherwise would be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly sound; but it is not my theame to dispute of their ignorances, onely this I must say of rowelling, it is a practise as necessary &amp; commendable for the good estate of a horses limbs, and body, as any medicine whatsoeuer, so it be applyed in his due time, and in his due place; otherwise on the contrary part, it is contrary to all goodnesse. The helpes which are got
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:26941:241"/>
by rowelling, are these, it separateth and dissolueth all euill humors, which either through naturall or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall corruptions are gathered, and knit together in any one place, hindering the office of any member, or deforming the body by any superfluity of euill substance; it looseneth parts that are bound, and bindeth those parts that are weakened; it giueth strength vnto sicke ioynts, &amp; comforteth whatsoeuer is opprest with any cold fleame, or hote chollericke substance; the generall vse of rowelling is, either for old inward straines, especially about the shoulders or hips, or else for great hard swellings, which will not be mollified, or corroded by any outward medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, which is either plaister or vnguente: for you must vnderstand, that when a horse receiueth any straine or bruise, either in the vpper ioynts of his shoulder, or his hips, which ioynts doe not stand one vpon another, as the lower ioyntes do, but they goe one into another, as the one end of the marrow-bone into the pot of the spade-bone, and the other end into the pot of the elbow, which is a double bone: now as I say, when a bruise is receiued in these parts, if by present application of hote and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table medicines the griefe be not taken away, then eftsoones there gathers betweene the pot and the bone a certaine bruisd jelly, which continually offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the tender gristell which couers the ends of euery bone, makes the horse to halt vehemently; and then is this corrupt matter not to bee taken away by any outward medicine, but by rowelling onely; &amp; as I speake of the shoulder, so I speake of the hips also where the vpper thigh-bone goeth into the pot of the cannel-bone, &amp; there beeedeth the like infirmitie.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="464" facs="tcp:26941:242"/>Now for the manner of rowelling it is in this sort: First, when you haue found out the certaine place of the horses griefe, as whether it bee on the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitch of the shoulder, on the hinder elbow, or on the hippe, then you shall (hauing cast the horse vpon some dung-hill, or soft ground) make a little slit more then a handfull below the place of his griefe through the skinne, and no more, so bigge as you may well thrust in a swannes quill into the same: then with your cornet raise the skinne a little from the flesh, and then put in your quill, and blow all the skinne from the flesh vpward; euen to the toppe, and all ouer the shoulder; then stopping the hole with your finger and your thumbe, take a smalll hazell sticke, and all to beate the blowne place all ouer; and then with your hand spread the winde into euery part, and after let it go: then take a tampin of horse haire twound together, or which is better, of red sarcinit, halfe the bignesse of a mans lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle finger, and aboue a foote, or sixtcene inches in length, made in this forme: <figure/> putting it into your rowel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling needle, which would bee at the least seuen or eight inches long; thrust it in at the first hole, and so putting it vpward, draw it out againe at least sixe inches aboue; &amp; then, if you please, you may put in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother aboue that: and then tye the two ends of the tampins or rowels together, and moue &amp; draw them to and froe in the skinne, in any wise not forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, both before you put them in, and euery day after they are in, to annoynt them well with butter, hogges grease, or oyle de bay.</p>
                     <p>Now there bee other Farriers which in that they
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:26941:242"/>
are opiniated that these long rowels, or tampins of hairemor silke, doe make both a double soare, and a great scarre, therefore they make their rowels of round peeces of stiffe leather, such as is the vpper part of an old shooe, with a round hole in the midst, according to this forme: <figure/> and then dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling it when they put it in, as soone as it is within, to spreade it, and lay it flatte betweene the flesh and the skinne, and so as the hole of the rowell may answere iust with the hole that is made in the horses skinne; and then once in two or three dayes to cleanse the rowell, and to annoynt it, and so put it in againe. Other Farriers do vse to make the rowell of lanthorne-horne, in the same fashion as it is made of leather, and in like sort to vse it. But for mine owne part, I haue vsed them all, and truly in my practise, finde not any better then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; onely the leather or the horne is somewhat more cleanly, and lesse offensiue to the eye, yet they aske much more attendance. Now if you rowel your horse for any swelling, then you shall euer put in your long rowell the same way that the veines runne, and seldome, or neuer crosse-wise, and the more you blow the skinne for a swelling, so much the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is: for the winde is it which onely occasioneth putrifaction, and makes the festered humours to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue, and distill downe from the secret hollowes of the ioynts, into those open places where it falleth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in matter, and so the beast becomes cured.</p>

                     <p>THere is to be obserued in the gelding of horses, first, the age; secondly, the season of the yeare; and lastly, the state of the Moone. For the age, if it be a colt, you may geld him at 9. dayes old, or 15. if his stones be come down: for to speake the truth the sooner that you geld him, it is so much the better, both for his growth, shape, and courage; albeit some hold an opinion, that at two yeares old should be the soonest, but they are mistaken, and their reasons are weake therein. Now if it be a horse that you would geld, then there is no speech to be made of his age: for it is without any question, that a perfect Farrrier may geld a horse without danger at any age whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, being carefull in the cure. Now for the season of the yeare, the best is in the Spring, betweene A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prill and May, or in the beginning of Iune at the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest, or else about the fall of the lease, which is the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of September. Now for the state of the Moone, the fittest time is euer when the Moone is in the waine: as touching the manner of gelding, it is in this sort, whether it bee foale, colt, or horse: First, you shall cast him either vpon straw, or vpon some dung-hill; then taking the stone betweene your fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most finger and your great finger, you shall with a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sine incision knife slit the codde, so that you may presse the stone forth and no more: then with a paire of small nippers, made either of steele, boxe-wood, or brasill, being very smooth, and clap the strings of the stone betweene them, very neere vnto the setting on of the stone, and presse them so hard, that there
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:26941:243"/>
may be no fluxe of bloud: then with a thin drawing cauterizing Iron made red hot, seare away the stone; then take a hard plaister made of rosen, waxe, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine, wel molten together, and with your hot Iron melt it vpon the head of the strings: then seare the strings, and then melt more of the salue, till such time as you haue layd a good thicknesse of the salue vpon the strings: then loose the nippers, and as you did with that stone, so do with the other also: then fill the two slits of the codde with white salt, and annoynt all the out-side of the codde, and all the horses belly and thighes with hogges grease cleane rendred; and so let him rise, and keepe him either in some very warme stable, or in some very warme pasture, where he may walke vp and downe; for there is nothing better for a horse in this case, then moderate exercise. Now if after his gelding you doe perceiue that his codde and sheath doth swell in any extraordinary fashion, then you shall chafe him vp and downe, and make him trotte an howre in a day, and it will soone recouer him, and make him sound without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny impediment.</p>

<pb n="468" facs="tcp:26941:244"/>
doth make the horses chine or backe a great deale the stronger, and more able to supporte burthen, as in truth it doth, and we daily finde it by continuall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. Now for the manner of curtalling of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, it is in this sort. First your shall with your fingar and your thumbe, grope till you find the third ioint from the setting on of the horses taile; and hauing found it, raise vp all the haire, and turne it backeward; then taking a very small strong corde wrappe it about that ioynt, and pull it both with your owne strength, and an other mans, so straite as you can possible pull it: then wrappe it about againe, and draw it as straite or straiter againe, and thus doe three or foure times about his taile, with all the possible straitnesse that may be; and then make fast the ends of the cord: then take a peece of wood, whose end is smooth and euen, of iust height with the strunt of the horses taile, &amp; set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it betweene the horses hinder legges (after you haue tramelled all his foure legges, in such sort that he can no waies stirre) then lay his taile thereupon, and taking a maine strong sharpe knife made for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, set the edge thereof so neare as you can gesse it, betweene the fourth and fift ioynt, and then with a great smithy hammer striking vpon the backe of the knife, cut the taile asunder; then if you see any blood to issue foorth, you shall know that the corde is not straite inough: and therefore you must draw it straiter; but if no blood follow, then it is well bound; this done, you shall take a <figure/> redde hote burning yron of the full compasse of the flesh of the horses taile, made round after this fashion, that the bone
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:26941:244"/>
of the taile may goe through the hole, and with it you shall seare the flesh, till you haue mortified it; and in the searing you shall see the ends of the veines start out like pape heads, but you shall stil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue searing them, vntill you see all to bee most smooth, plaine and hard, so that the blood cannot breake through the burning; then may you bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnloose the cord, and after two or three daies that you see the soare beginne to rot, you shall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynt it with fresh butter, or else with hogges grease, and turpentine, vntill it bee whole.</p>

                     <p>IF you will at any time make a white starre, either in your horses fore-head or in any other part of his body, you shall according to the opinion of the most ancient Farriers, take a tile stone, and after you haue burned it, beate it into fine powder; then take lilie rootes, dasie rootes, white bryer rootes, of each a like quantity, and hauing dryed them beate them also into fine powder, and mixe them with the first; then with a razor shaue that part of your horse where you would haue your starre: and then with this powder rubbe it so ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently, that you scarce leaue any skinne on; then take a good quantity of hony-suckle flowres, and a like quantity of hony, &amp; the water wherein a moule hath bene sodden; &amp; then distill them into a water, and with that water, wash the soare place the space
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:26941:245"/>
of three daies together, and keepe the winde from it, and you shall presently see the white haires to grow; for this receipt hath bene often very well approued. There bee other Farriers, which take a crabbe, and roast it, and being fire hote, bind it to that part which you would haue white, and it will scald away the old haire, &amp; the next haire that groweth wil be white. Other Farriers vse after they haue shaued the place to take the iuice of sharpe onions or leeks, and to bathe the place very much therewith; then to take barley bread, as fire hot as it commeth from the ouen, and clap it to the shauen place, suffring it to lye so till it be cold: and then after annoynt it with hony, and the white haire will come. Other Farriers vse to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynt the shauen place with the grease of a moldy-warpe sodde, and that will bring white haires. Other Farriers vse after they haue shaued it, to rub the place well with salte, and then twice euery day for a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, to wash it with the broth wherein a mouldy-warpe, and some swines grease hath bene sodden. Other Farriers vse to boyle a mouldy-warpe in salt water for three daies together, or else in strong lye; and euer as one liquor consumeth, to supply it with an other; then with this decoction being warme, annoynt the shaued place, and it will bring white haires sodainely. Other Farriers take the gall of a goate, and rubbe the shaued place therewith, and it will bring white haires also. Other Farriers take sheepes milke and boyle it, and in that wet a linnen cloth, and being very hote lay it to, renewing it till you may rubbe off the the haire with your fingar; this done, apply the milke to twice a day luke warme, till the haire doe come againe, which without all
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:26941:245"/>
question will be white. Other Farriers take the rootes of wilde cowcumbers, and twice so much <hi>Nitrum</hi> mingled with oyle and hony, or else adde to your cowcumbers <hi>Sal nitrum,</hi> beaten, and hony, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynt the shauen place therewith, and it will bring white haire. Other Farriers vse to take a peece of a bricke-bat, and with it gently to rubbe and chafe the place, till by the continuance therof, you haue rubbed away both the haire and the skinne, so broad as you would haue the starre, and then after to annoynt it with hony, till the haire come againe; or else to roast a colewort stalke like a warden, or an egge, til it be stone hard: and then as they come hote out of the fire, to clappe either of them to the horses forehead, and it will scald off the haire, then to annoynt it with hony till the haire come againe. Now to conclude, and to shew you the most perfect &amp; absolute experiment which I haue euer found to bee most infallible, it is thus; you shall take a very fine, sharpe, long bodkin, made for the purpose, and thrust it vp betwixt the skinne and the bone vpward, so long as you would haue the star; and in thrusting it vp you shall hollow the skin from the bone, the bignesse that you would haue the starre: this done, you shall <figure/> take a peece of lead, made in the true shape of your bodkin, &amp; draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the bodkin, thrust in the lead into the same hoales; then you shall thrust the bodkin croswise, the forehead vnderneath the lead; and then thrusting in such another peece of lead, you fhall see it in the horses face to present this figure,
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:26941:246"/>
which being done, you shall take a very strong packe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threed, and putting it vnderneath all the foure ends of the leads, and drawing it with all straitnesse, you shall gather all the hollow skinne together on a purse, folding the packe-threed oft and oft about, and stil straiter and straiter, so that you shall see it then to present vnto you this figure: <figure/> this done, you shall let it rest at least the space of eight and forty howres, in which time the skinne will bee, as it were, mortified: then may you vnloose the pack-threed, and draw forth the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den pinnes, and with your hand close the hollow skinne to the fore-heade hard againe; and shortly after you shall see the haire to fall away, and the next haire which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth will bee white; and this experiment is most infallible. Now there bee some Farriers which will not put in pinnes, nor vse any packe-threed, but onely will slit the fore-head, and open the skinne on both sides, and then put in either a horne or a plate of leade as bigge as the starre, and so let it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine till the skinne rot; then take out the horne or lead, and annoynt the place with hony, and the water of mallowes sod, and it will bring white haire: and surely this experiment also is most infallible, but it maketh a foule soare, and is somewhat long in bringing his vertue to effect.</p>

If a horses hoofes bee rugged, and as it were seamed, one seame ouer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; if they bee dry, full, and crustie, it is a signe of very old age: as on the contrary part, a smooth, moyst, hollow, and well sounding hoofe, is a signe of young yeares.
