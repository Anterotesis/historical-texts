            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I neuer read of subiect, that returned to recouer his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, or purposes, by the meere coadiutement of a forraigne King (except that King proiected for himselfe, to make ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers disloyaltie the steps to stand more firmely vpon, and raise his owne ambition to a greater height) yet haue they not desisted to follow the deceits of their owne hearts, and

as the <hi>Iewes</hi> found a rotten Reede and broken Staffe of <hi>Egypt,</hi> vndertaken impossibilities, to the destruction of infinite thousands, and at the best but the sauing of their owne liues for a time.</p>
            <p>For although <hi>Hadad</hi> an <hi>Edomite</hi> of the Kings seede fled vnto <hi>Pharao</hi> King of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> who gaue him a House, Land, and the sister of his wife, euen <hi>Taphnes</hi> the Queene, whereby it should seeme hee thriued in his reuolt: Yet alas was it so farre from preiudicing of <hi>Salomon,</hi> that he onely discouered a willingnesse, without power or meanes to disturbe the State, and made the great King stand on his guard the better: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Ieroboam</hi> fled vnto <hi>Sisag,</hi> continuing there vnto the death of <hi>Salomon,</hi> and so receiued as it were supportation in his Treasons: Yet it was the reuolt of the tenne Tribes, and the curse which branded <hi>Salomons</hi> Idolatry, made <hi>Israel</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell against <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> and settled this Seruant in his Masters Throne: Although as <hi>Herodotus</hi> reporteth, that <hi>Harpagus Medus</hi> (after <hi>Astiages</hi> had with great immanity murthered his Sonne) fled vnto <hi>Cirus</hi> into <hi>Persia,</hi> in hope of reuenge, and so set the East and whole <hi>Asia</hi> in combustion: Yet alas hee onely made hauock of his Countrey, and brought a stranger to possesse both the <hi>Monarchies.</hi>

of instances (especially concerning traytors, who were all choa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with this <hi>Machiuillian Position</hi> of admitting the Treason, but not suborning the Traytors) did I not purpose to disclaime an vnciuill vncouering the hoary head of Antiquity, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uulge this <hi>Principle,</hi> that there is no confidence in Princes, further then the reuolts of others may second their own bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse, and the priuate quarrels of a kingdome weaken themselues for a strangers admission, which yet must be done by the factions, and coadiutements of the same Nation: Therfore I stand amazed at the fanaticall hopes of diuers Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in our nation, that in those daies relied vpon the suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>Spayne,</hi> &amp; are still confident on the blessings and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings of the <hi>Pope,</hi> especially his ridiculous excommunicating of Princes, now laughed at through the World; when they cannot afford me one example, neither domestick, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne; neither obsolete or moderne; neither diuine nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, of any subiect stepping awry into the by-waies of rebellion or insurrection, that was established by a forraigne Prince, except that Prince (as I said before) proiected by such a bridge to transport his owne power for his owne ends, and priuate satisfaction; But I would faine disclaime any vnci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill opening the graues of the Dead; and content my selfe with displaying the colours of time, not yet elapsed from our owne memories.</p>
            <p>When the children of that worthy <hi>Edmond Ironside</hi> fled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Hungarie</hi> from that preuailing greatnesse of <hi>Canutus,</hi> I doe not read of their triumphant returne, nor other establishment against that braue Dane, till the factions of <hi>England</hi> broke out into flames of their priuate reuenges. When <hi>Henry</hi> the second had crowned his sonne King of <hi>England,</hi> and that the impatient young man could not endure his owne Father in the competition, the Story saies, the Prince with his brethren fled into <hi>France,</hi> but how they returned; how they prospered; &amp; how they were supported, it is lamentable one way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and remarkeable another way to relate. In that deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable businesse of <hi>Edward</hi> the second, when his wife and son presumed on the assistance of the <hi>French</hi> King; I hope it was
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:21793:6"/>
not that power which established the young Prince, but the authoritie of <hi>Mortimer</hi> that suppressed the misled King: When <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth preuailed, Queene <hi>Isabel</hi> fled to her owne brother, about the restoring of <hi>Richard</hi> 2. but to what purpose? To bemoane her remedilesse griefes, and returne, (if euer shee did returne) without suppliment of sufficient as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance: The Earle of <hi>Richmond,</hi> though afterward <hi>Henry</hi> the seuenth, in the confused times of the <hi>Yorkest</hi> preuailings, went into <hi>Brittaine,</hi> and so into <hi>France,</hi> but how he had like to haue beene serued, <hi>Peter Landoise</hi> the Secretary, and the Kings gold could then haue vnueiled the corruption of either, and when that Fortune led him by the hand, to pace out the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of victories, I hope it was no <hi>French</hi> power, but <hi>English</hi> Friends and the Iustice of Diuine prouidence, which seated him so happily in the Throne of greatnesse: How <hi>Perkin War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck,</hi> for all his exhaled vapouring, went forward assisted by the Scottish policie, Flemmish credulitie, and inueterat ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of the Duches of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> against the house of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> our stages of <hi>London,</hi> haue instructed those which cannot read: How the Earle of <hi>Westmerland,</hi> and numbers of <hi>English</hi> fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, haue beene entertained abroad, some ouerthrown with calamitous desperation, some colluded with the incantations of Friers &amp; religious miracles, some distracted with guiltines of Conscience, some transfounded with ambitious prosecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp; some preuaricated with an outward glory of Military profession, all men can discouer with repining eyes, or else let them ouerlooke a well compacted breuiary to the same purpose, discoursing of the entertainement of <hi>English</hi> fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues beyond the Seas.</p>

implacable contention betweene the two Families of <hi>Yorke</hi> and <hi>Lancaster,</hi> not onely deformed the prosperity of <hi>England,</hi> but according to the preuailing of factious Greatnesse, sent ouer diuers Gouernours, their particeans into <hi>Ireland,</hi> who still temporizing with the strongest party, and contriuing for their priuate, lest the generall cause at randome, and were indeed vnable to redact to any vniformity of gouernement the disparity of <hi>Irish</hi> obedience, and so gaue way vnto this ambitious, insulting, and rude people to hold vp their heads, and aduance themselues, as high as their owne titles, the law <hi>Tanist,</hi> and liberty of nature could dignifie them.</p>

            <p>But when the strength of our armies, and fortune of the warres had both ouerawed their weaknesse, and reduced to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:21793:8"/>
good order those dangerous enemies, bringing them into the schoole of correction for their misdemeanors, and reformation for their inciuility: This <hi>Con</hi> was compelled to prostrate himselfe before the Maiesty of <hi>England,</hi> and so disclaimnig the title of <hi>Oneale,</hi> by Letters-Patents was created Earle of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rone,</hi> his eldest sonne <hi>Mathew</hi> (though suspected a Bastard) Baron of <hi>Dunganon,</hi> and all his Family, as it were incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the new obedience of the King: This <hi>Mathew</hi> vntill the age of fifteene yeere, was imputed the sonne of a Smith in <hi>Dundalk,</hi> whose wife being <hi>Oneales</hi> Concubine, did at the time of death, according to the custome of <hi>Ireland,</hi> present him with this sonne, whome <hi>Oneale</hi> did not onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue with gladnesse, but accepted him as his owne, yea pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred him before his other children to his titles, and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Iohannes</hi> or <hi>Shane Oneale,</hi> his sonne by a lawfull wife, tooke it in such indignity, that making a strong faction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his father, hee not onely supplanted his brother <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> cutting off his head, but tormented the old <hi>Con</hi> with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vnnaturall assaults, and violent excursions, depopulating his territories, killing his complices, banishing his auxilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and at last brought him with vntimely griefe vnto his graue, and all the country to bee affrighted with his tyranny. For he not onely stepped forward more gloriously, then his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ancestors, proclayming himselfe the great <hi>Oneale,</hi> but with seuerall expeditions contracted the loue and obseruation of the other Prouinces, insomuch that many Rebels both of <hi>Conach, Meths,</hi> and <hi>Munster</hi> assisted him in the prosecution of <hi>Mathews</hi> childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, amongst whom <hi>Brian</hi> (falling into the hands of <hi>Maudonel Totan</hi>) was cruelly murthered: <hi>Hugh</hi> &amp; <hi>Cormach</hi> were vnder <hi>English</hi> protection, and hardy preserued, which fell out so crosly against <hi>Shanes</hi> expectation, and disastrous to his rebellious presumption, that with a lothsome sauage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and traitrous conspiracy he deformed the beauty of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> peace, and made hauock in a strange manner of her prosperity, to which insolency and violent rage of preuailing, Sir <hi>Henry Sidney,</hi> L.

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:21793:9"/>
of <hi>Sussex</hi> Lord Lieutenant made opposition, and cast such blocks in the way, that his fury was somewhat rebated, and a <hi>Cataplasme</hi> of restraint applied; and when there was no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy but cutting and fearing the vlcerous flesh of this putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied body of Rebellion, by force of Armes, hee not onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsed the indignity, lashing the sides of these proud Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons with the stripes of a reuengefull hand, but brought this insulting Lord on his knees, and made him confesse the supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority of <hi>Englands</hi> Maiesty.</p>
            <p>But first by way of expostulation, the matter was dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with this <hi>Shane,</hi> how he durst presume to cast, as it were a defiance into the face of <hi>Englands</hi> Gouernment, and put on his <hi>Iearean</hi> wings to flie higher, then his owne Feathers would warrant him. Hee answered very peremptorily, that hee was the true, and lawfull heire of <hi>Con Oneale,</hi> as issuing from a worthy wife and of a noble house, whereas <hi>Mathew</hi> was the Sonne of a Smith in <hi>Dondalck,</hi> and onely foisted in to ouerthrow the families of <hi>Oneale,</hi> which hee neither would nor could be a <hi>Pathick</hi> vnto, as for the Kings Letters patents affording <hi>Con</hi> the honor of a <hi>Coronet,</hi> and title of Earle, a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning way to extenuate his worth, and greatnesse in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, it was apparant, that <hi>Con</hi> had no interest, but for tearme of life, nor could without the consent of the Lords, and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastas</hi> of <hi>Vlster,</hi> transferre anothers right into the Kings hands: Besides, such was the ancient glory of his Familie, that the true heire must bee certified by the Oath of Twelue Men, which in <hi>Mathews</hi> case fayled, and therefore was the nullity of them very conspicuous, and all such proceedings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> against him worthily frustrated, but concerning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, he had approbation both from God &amp; Man, as the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Sonne of a louing Wife, and was confirmed by the law <hi>Tanist,</hi> according to the suffrages of the people, and seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall applauses of the Families of <hi>Vlster,</hi> and for his since pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, hee neuer admitted of other thought, then to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the ancient glory of his vnmatchable House, nor vsurped other iurisdiction, then his Ancestors by many Presidents, &amp; apparant records had formerly exercised, and confirmed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:21793:9"/>
contradiction, and to which, the other Kings of <hi>England</hi> had graciously consented, and most indulgently protected them.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding all this, hee ranne a contrary course to former protestations, &amp; in the violent race of rebellion, plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged himself, to his vtter extirpation &amp; confusion, as by the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quell may appeare: For first he audaciously suppressed <hi>O Realy,</hi> &amp; quarrelling with <hi>Callogh O Donel,</hi> defeated his complices, tauished his wife, imprisoned himselfe and children, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uasted his Castles, vsurped his inheritance, and like the King of <hi>Vlster</hi> indeede proceeded with all imperiousnesse, and malicious insulting ouer his inferiors: but as soone as <hi>Thomas</hi> Earle of <hi>Sussex,</hi> Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> prepared our <hi>English</hi> forces to rebate his pride, and reduce the other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, hee a little moderated his ambitious courses, and a while procrastinated his former resolutions, wherein the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion of <hi>Gerard</hi> Earle of <hi>Kildare</hi> his Cosin, whom <hi>Queene Mary</hi> had restored, was so effectuall, that he retired into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and in all suppliant manner abiected himselfe before the Councell, with promises and strange protestations, not onely of being a true subiect, but an entertayner of Ciuility, and fashionable order, both in life and habit: the hope whereof dismissed him home againe, and like a cunning strumpet, insinuating with the good opinion of a new decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Friend, hee beganne reasonably well, shutte his eares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Syren-like</hi> temptations of his Bardes and Rimers, vndertooke to heare the controuersies of his people, releeued the wants of the distressed. In a word, demeaned himselfe with a noble kinde of moderation in Peace, and when there was cause of Warre, expulsed the <hi>Scots</hi> of <hi>Vlster,</hi> &amp; cut off the head of <hi>Iames Mac-Connell</hi> their captaine, and principall occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of that Innouation.</p>
            <p>In these sweete passages of peace and quietnesse, hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued a while, and the poore churle thought hee beheld a faire shining Planet in a perspicuous Heauen, growing proude of such an alteration, that hee now might complaine of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued iniuries, and obtaine redresse for vnsufferable wrongs:
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:21793:10"/>
But the better sort finding him ouer-insolent to indure, and misdoubting a proiect against all their estates and dignities, complotted to ouerthrow him, suggesting matter against him, and so ordered the busines, that <hi>Mac-Guier</hi> Lord of <hi>Ferma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagh</hi> came in person to Sir <hi>Henry Sidney,</hi> by this time Lord Deputy, to implore his assistance, for the restrayning, or if you will, suppressing this vsurping King of the North, which <hi>Shane Oneale</hi> tooke so despitefully, and apprehended with such indignation, that drunke with rage, he became vnsensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of reason, &amp; forgetting his allegeance with all the former faire promises of loyaltie, he prosecuted <hi>Mac-Guier</hi> at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, with fire and sword, besieged <hi>Armagh,</hi> demolished the Church, destroyed the buildings, and came to <hi>Dondalk,</hi> with purpose to ruine the Countrey, but was a while intercepted by a worthy expedition of Sir <hi>Wil. Sercefield</hi> Maior, and the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens of <hi>Dubline,</hi> I might adde the power of the Countrey, &amp; the mustred forces of the <hi>English Irish</hi> about <hi>Sordes</hi> &amp; <hi>Tredagh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this time are the royall arms of the State spred abroad, &amp; the Lord Deputy, after he had shipped 7. companies of Foot, &amp; a troope of Horse for <hi>Logh-foile</hi> vnder the command of Sir <hi>Ed. Randoll,</hi> set forward in person toward the North with the rest of the Army, which when <hi>Shane</hi> had intelligence of (as what could be done, which some or other made him not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with?) &amp; that hee vnderstood there was a purpose with all aduantages to presse him both behinde &amp; before, he raysed himselfe toward the <hi>Derry,</hi> and with great expedition brought the matter to deciding, so that many skirmishes were but as it were preparatiues to that maine encounter, which to his perpetual renown cost Sir <hi>Ed. Randoll</hi> his life, &amp; brought <hi>Shane</hi> to confusion: For very quickly all his purposes were disanulled, his forces weakened, his Rebels dissipated, &amp; the whole strength of his proiects infringed; so that despay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to reintegrate his estate, he determined a strange alteratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (O that man dare presume of any thing, being subiect to such an alteration!) with a Halter about his neck, to submit to the <hi>Deputy</hi>: but diuerted from so base a course by the aduice, and couragious spirit of his Secretary, hee made tryall of a new
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:21793:10"/>
confederacy with <hi>Alexander Oge</hi> and the <hi>Scots,</hi> who were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident and rebellious in the <hi>Claude Boies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But first, as an introduction of peace, hee released <hi>Surleboy,</hi> the brother of <hi>Alexander,</hi> whom hee had long detained in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: and thus presuming on this new combination with the enforced <hi>Odonnels</hi> wife, and some few others, he is welcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med into the tent of <hi>Alexander,</hi> and for the present entertained as the very Prince of the North, or King of <hi>Vlster</hi>: but after extraordinary drinking, and ouer-liberall carouses, certaine vnkindnesses and vnfortunate repetitions began betweene them about his other brothers death, and the honour of his sister, whom <hi>Shane</hi> had formerly married, but despightfully refused: Wine ouercame reason, reason thus entangled was subiected to confusion of words, words encreased rage; and rage induced reuenge; so that <hi>Alex<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Oge,</hi> and <hi>Mac. Gilaspic</hi> his brother tooke aduantage of the time and these occasions, which was performed with such inueterate malice, and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue digressions, that <hi>Shane</hi> was set vpon, ouermastered, and with many wounds slaine: that his Secretary was cut in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, his wife or rather Concubine surprised, and the company dispersed: that the Rebels of the North were vtterly subuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, these <hi>Scots</hi> made a way to their admission and pardon, and by consequence the peace of <hi>Vlster</hi> restored.</p>
            <p>This businesse thus setled and determined, a Parliament was called in <hi>Ireland,</hi> in which <hi>Shane Oneale</hi> with all his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers was proscribed, the name of <hi>Oneale</hi> interdicted, the Lands and territories of the North or <hi>Vlster</hi> incorporated to the Crowne of <hi>England,</hi> and all occasions of innouation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued, had not <hi>Turlogh Leignogh</hi> brothers sonne to <hi>Con More Oneale</hi> assumed the title: a man of declining age, and more quiet then the rest of his name, suspecting indeede, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their law <hi>Tanist,</hi> either <hi>Shane Oneales</hi> sonnes, or <hi>Hugh</hi> Baron of <hi>Dunganmon</hi> might intercept his claime, and preuent his right, as he supposed, which compelled him to this auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious enterprise, contrary to the edict and prohibition of the same: notwithstanding, to salue the sore of his suspected loi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, he kept correspondency with vs in all his other actions,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:21793:11"/>
and in her Maiesties seruice, not only encountred <hi>Odonell,</hi> but ouerthrew the <hi>Scots Ilanders,</hi> and at last destroyed <hi>Alexander Oge,</hi> the murtherer of <hi>Shane Oneale.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this while <hi>Hugh</hi> the sonne of <hi>Mathew</hi> stood on his guard, and liued warily: sometimes vnder the security of his owne faithfull followers, sometimes vnder the trust of <hi>English</hi> protection, (for so in his yonger time he trooped in the streets of <hi>London</hi> with sufficient equipage, and orderly respect) and sometimes as a Souldier he commanded a company of horse vnder the Deputy in <hi>Munster,</hi> against the Earle of <hi>Desmond,</hi> with a pension beside of one thousand marke a yeere out of the Exchequer, which orderly proceedings with the trust conceiued of his loialty drew the bow for him, wherewith hee hot the marke of his owne aime, and so by new Leters-Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, hauing diuers restraints and reseruations, hee was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his Grandfathers titles, and inheritances, nor should it seeme that <hi>Turlogh Leignogh</hi> stomached his aduancement, but rather vpon hope of his vertues, which gaue a lustre to his actions, surrendred his titles and Lordships into his hands: But oh the ambition of men? or vnconstancy of manners? these proceedings with him in this faire and gentle manner, made him either proud of his owne greatnesse, or presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous that the State was afraid to displease him, or superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous after the Priests had insorcered him. For presently against the Queenes absolute prohibition, this new <hi>Tirone</hi> takes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him the title of <hi>Oneale,</hi> excusing the fact, lest some rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious spirit according to their warlike custome of maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that Character in their Family, might assume the same, taking aduantage of his negligence, protesting to disclaime the honour, so he might not be vrged by oath: and from hence arose the first motiue of <hi>Tirones</hi> vnsted fastnesse.</p>
            <p>At this instant was that memorable defeat, and admirable discomfiture of the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> formidable Armado, or if you will according to <hi>Mendozas</hi> owne words (then Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor <hi>Leiger</hi> in <hi>Paris</hi>) inuincible Nauy, whereby in their returne by <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> many of them perished, but the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sort were kindly intertaind by <hi>Tirone</hi> after the manner of

               <hi>Irish</hi> Hospitality, and vnexpectedly welcome, considering, that any reliefe to men in distresse, and cast on a strange shore by Shipwrack, is as Balme and Oile powred into wounds: In requitall whereof such a Loome of mischiefe was set on worke, that at the last the cloth was wouen of his corruption, and folded together to keepe his treasons warme in his owne bosome, till a strong supposed, and yet presumptuous hand, spred it abroade to his vtter destruction, and shamefull dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace by reason of his deformed filthinesse.</p>
            <p>For when then these straggling <hi>Spaniards</hi> perceiued his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall inclination to ambitious willingnesse, concerning the maintaining some turbulent faction in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a stirring spirit for the glory of his Ancestors, they quickly added fuell to the fire, and with all the baites of pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity and incantations to flattery choaked his loialty, &amp; cast dust into the eyes of his faithfulnesse: Some promising, that their great Master should recompence his humanity, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble respect: Some repining at their misfortune, layd many slaunders on the shoulders of our country: Some vnder col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of religious obedience assured, that the <hi>Pope</hi> himselfe should gratifie him: Some more dangerously cunning crept within him by that imposturing art of commendation, infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring he was more worthy of a Crowne, then a subiects prosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, &amp; some more plainely with demonstratiue reasons led him as it were by the hand to the chaire of presumption, and possibility, that it might bee so, if he durst attend his owne fortunes, and prosecute the times in their seuerall changes: By which occasion this mans irresolute loue to his Prince and country was first enuenomed and tainted: Afterward it ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cled more and more in his declining from himselfe and first soundnesse by contracting a league with <hi>Spaine.</hi> Thirdly, it swelled apace with the oath and allegeance of many follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and particians, to coadiute him in any enterprise whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer; and last of all, it restred incurably in consenting (and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the same in practice) to bee an opposite to the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>England,</hi> and a famous Rebell against the peace of our country, which yet was neither so cautelously disposed of,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:21793:12"/>
nor firmely compacted, but <hi>Hugh ne Gauclock,</hi> his brother, fearing the feareful consequence of the downefall of his house, discouered the same, for which the Earle found a time to strangle him, colourably prosecuting the Actors, that durst lay hands on any of the bloud of <hi>Oneale</hi>: but alas it serued not his turne: For not onely this barbarous <hi>Fratricide,</hi> but all his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther refractary courses were laid open to the peering eyes of <hi>Englands</hi> Maiesty: but such was his preuailing fortune, that vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his reasonable iustifications, and seeming penitency, our gracious <hi>Elizabeth</hi> not onely remitted those offences with fauour, but continued him in his Greatnesse with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
            <p>In this manner he moued awhile in the highest orbe of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity, and from our <hi>English</hi> supportation commanded his country, as a Prince of the North, and except an open display<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the colours of Rebellion, performed, what he durst, and durst doe any thing, which tended not to manifest treason, and dangerous innouation. For not long after, vnder colour of corroborating the peace of his country and insinuation with some <hi>English</hi> affinity, hee made Sir <hi>Samuel Bagnols</hi> sister beleeue, that the great <hi>Oneale</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> was captiuated to her loue, and in which, if the time could haue serued, hee would haue shewed himselfe as braue and complete an <hi>Amorist,</hi> as the formallest Courtier in <hi>England</hi>: To this the Lady seemed no great opposite, onely with some shew of modesty depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on her brother, she referd the successe to his approbatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who som what too stubborne, interposed as it were a negatiue, not without exprobation of the barbarous customes of the North of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which <hi>Tirone</hi> interpreted disgracious to his exaltation, and finding no other remedy to appease his wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, in a manner by force of armes tooke her to his wife; wherevpon hee was denied her dowry, and that exasperated his displeasure: to which when the Deputy added the suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of <hi>Mac Mahond</hi> his neighbour, I am afraid it exulcera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his loialty. For when hee perceiued hee was forbidden the title, to the abasing of his Family, and saw his inheritance dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the impouerishing his estate, he quickly startled
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:21793:12"/>
vp, and many displeasures discouered themselues against his former establishment, so that the Earle, by occasion of retch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse booke-keepers cast vp his vntoward account in this manner:</p>
            <p>First, that the State had a purpose to suppresse the flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing eminence both of himselfe, and all the Lords of the North: Next; that they should bee compelled to alter their Religion, and disclaime the <hi>Popes</hi> vsurped authoritie ouer the Church: Thirdly, that the Marshall Sir <hi>Henry Bagnoll</hi> had not onely prosecuted him with despightfull and malignant enmity, but iustified Articles of Treason against him: Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he was denied the fruits of his owne labor, and honor of his industry, after he had (as hee obiected) with the losse of much blood, and expending of great Treasure of his owne, reducted the Prouince of <hi>Vlster</hi>: And last of all, that Sir <hi>William Fitz-William</hi> Lord Deputy, had not only giuen way to the malice of the Marshall, but possessed the Court of <hi>England</hi> with many vntruths against him; all which were quickly capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulated to the <hi>Dinastas</hi> of the North, his kinsmen, fauorites, and dependents, &amp; they as quickly commiserated his discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, and meerely out of inueterate hate against vs all, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted themselues to the maintaining the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion, and obedience to the house of <hi>Oneale,</hi> keeping yet an open correspondency with vs, though in couert their hearts (as the Lapwing cryeth farthest from her nest) stored vp as it were all prouocations of disloyalty, lying yet in waite for some ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantagious excuse, if they once were discouered.</p>
            <p>The first that brake the Ice of their ill contriued Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons was <hi>Mac Guier,</hi> a turbulent yong man, crafty, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uengefull, who seduced by <hi>Gauranus</hi> a Priest, confirmed Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of <hi>Ireland</hi> by the <hi>Pope,</hi> inuaded <hi>Conagh,</hi> and in insulting manner vsurped the Countrey as hee went, with full confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that the holy Fathers blessings should in a manner make security, and successe attend them: But the doores of Heauen were barred on the inside, excluding them as yet from any entrance, and the vertue of Sir <hi>Richard Bingham</hi> so counterchecked <hi>Mac Guiers</hi> fortunes, that hee fled discomfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:21793:13"/>
the Primate slaine, and all his forces dispersed: Yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a while the scattered limbs of <hi>Pelops</hi> are gathered together, and as if <hi>Anteus</hi> should recouer by touching the Earth, <hi>Mac Guier</hi> maketh a stronger party, and with some deceiueable beginnings, goes into more open Action, against whom the Earle of <hi>Tyrone</hi> himselfe was compelled to ioyne with the Marshall his only suspected enemy, and receiued a wound in that seruice: But his heart, as it should seeme, was worser hurt with priuate discontentments: For you must vnderstand that before he set forward in her Maiesties seruice, order was taken for the safe keeping of <hi>Shane Oneales</hi> children, whose deliuery hee had denied to the State, inferring by way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, that the Lord Deputy and Marshall picked nothing but quarrels against him, and by new occsiaons of vnkinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse determined to supplant him.</p>
            <p>Now is Sir <hi>William Fitzwilliam</hi> recalled, and Sir <hi>William Russell</hi> constituted Deputy in his stead, to whom of his owne accord the Earle of <hi>Tyrone</hi> came to submitte himselfe, with all those promises, that might induce a generous spirit to beleeue him: but the Marshall <hi>Bagnoll</hi> then present audaciously arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated. <hi rend="sup">1</hi> That he countenanced <hi>Mac Guier</hi> and the Primats Rebellion: <hi rend="sup">2</hi>. That hee supported <hi>Odonell,</hi> and the rest of that coniuration: <hi rend="sup">3</hi>. That by the aduice of <hi>Cormach Mac Baron,</hi> his Bastard Sonne <hi>Con</hi> had coadiutement from him in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uastation of <hi>Monaghan,</hi> and besieging of <hi>Inigkellin:</hi> 
               <hi rend="sup">4</hi>. That hee corrupted the Faith and Obedience of the Captaines of <hi>Kilulto</hi> and <hi>Kilwarney</hi>: <hi rend="sup">5</hi>. And that all his protestations were counterfet and dissimulatory fictions. These were hainous obiections, and indeede deuided the Councell: For the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty and Marshall would haue detayned him prisoner, but the greater part eyther by vaine feare, or corrupted respects, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceded vntill a more fitter oportunity, to whom as men bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter acquainted with the affaires of <hi>Ireland</hi> the Lord Deputy hardly condiscended.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Tyrone</hi> returned home, and indeede turned as the Dog to his vomit, to his former impressed resolutions to disturbe the State, if the State disturbed him: whereupon vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:21793:13"/>
of an Army raysed in <hi>England</hi> with new supplies of 1300. Low-countrey Souldiers against him, whom that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and renowned Sir <hi>Iohn Norris</hi> by the famous name of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Norris</hi> brought out of <hi>Britany,</hi> hee not onely stood on his guard, but mustred his followers (by this time reasonably disciplin'd in the open fields, and whilst the <hi>English</hi> went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Balishanon</hi> and <hi>Belike,</hi> Castles at the further end of <hi>Logh Erne,</hi> he approched Black-water Fort, and comming on the suddaine, had it surrendered into his hands, but not with that confidence, that eyther hee relied on the security of the place, or power of his owne Army: whereupon he very politiquely one way attempted the Earle of <hi>Kildare</hi> to support him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the manifest iniuries of the Deputy and Marshall, and another way promised the Earle of <hi>Ormond</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Wallop</hi> Treasurer, to remaine within the limits of iustifiable obedience: To this hee added the vnclasping the booke of these occurrences to Sir <hi>Iohn Norris</hi> Generall of the Army, imploring his commiseration, and as it were begging at his hands, that hee might not bee enforced to such exorbitant actions, as necessity and the law of Nature would and could contriue; but the former Letters the Marshall intercepted, and these too Generall <hi>Norris</hi> quite suppressed, which he spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly misliked, though it fell not to his turne absolutely to finde fault withall: But when <hi>Tyrone</hi> vnderstood of these ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnious and dangerous proceedings against him, hee was put quite out of patience, exclayming, that his destruction was now on the webbe, and in the hands of a pestilent worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, yea his aduersary wanted onely meanes to his will to contriue his vtter destruction indeede.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding all this; hee put on new wings to his deceiueable hopes, and turmoyled all the Kingdome with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficious Rebellion, whereupon hee was publikely proclaymed Traytor, and enemy to the Queene, which hee professed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly with all correspondency of an aduersary. For in <hi>Vlster</hi> his Army consisted of a 1000. Horse, and 7000. Foote. In <hi>Conach</hi> he had (or if you wil, <hi>O Roorck</hi> and the <hi>Conners</hi> kept them together at his disposing) 200. Horse, and 2400. Foote:
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:21793:14"/>
In Lease and <hi>Ophaly,</hi> the number was as vncertaine, as their dispositions, being sometimes violent Rebels, and anon sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missiue Subiects. In <hi>Munster</hi> they liued so dispersed, that the Gouernour found it worke enough to finde them out, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them: The <hi>English</hi> forces vnder Sir <hi>Iohn Norris</hi> equalled their greatest Armies, but nothing was done worthy of so great a Commanders name, and souldiers renowne. For vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der colour of priuate displeasure betweene the Deputy and him, many bad offices were performed, and the time spent to small purpose in parlies and conferences, affording <hi>Tirone</hi> such leisure, that hee contracted with <hi>Spaine,</hi> and expected from thence continuall supplies.</p>
            <p>But before the matter came to martiall deciding, Sir <hi>Henry Wallop</hi> Treasurer at warrs, and Sir <hi>Robert Gardner</hi> chiefe Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of the Kings Bench, men layd downe in the ballance of integrity, wisedome and experience, were deligated to heare the grieuances of these great Lords of the North, enforced to a defensiue warre, as they intimated, and yet obscured by the name of traytors against the State: The commiserate hearing of these compulsions, and vnquiet discourses from so dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a faction, returned our <hi>English</hi> Commissioners with some amazement at their oratory, and cunning insinuation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they might haue excused diuers things, if by a wrong course they had not incurred the danger of contesting with Princes, yea their royall Souereigne, whose incensed Maiesty could not indure such opposition: whereupon the truce is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerpassed, and the Trumpet of defiance sounded through the Kingdome, foreshewing, that the Schoolemaster of reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was at hand, and Sir <hi>Iohn Norris</hi> as Lord Generall of the Armie in the absence of the Deputy, ready to display the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of correction, but it should seeme the Deputy would needes haue a share in the glory of this businesse. For con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his first appointment, hee hasted apace, and vnited his troopes with Sir <hi>Iohn Norris,</hi> and so both together attended the successe of the matter, and prosperity of the time.</p>
            <p>The beginning was a fortunate terrifying him at <hi>Armagh,</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:21793:14"/>
and pressing him so closely, that the Earle left Black-water Fort, dismantled the Towne thereabouts, fiered some houses at <hi>Dungannon</hi> his owne principall seat, and secured himselfe in his chiefest fastnesse, winning much time by this politike retreat, but we vnexperienced in those dangerous places of his boggs and woods, with only proclaiming him Traitor in his country, and leauing Garrison in <hi>Armagh,</hi> returned, which <hi>Tirone</hi> audaciously interpreted to his owne aduantage, repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at nothing more, then our fortification in <hi>Monaghan</hi>: Thus was our businesse kept awhile out of the running cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of applause. For the Deputy and the Generall of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie grew to some impatient contradicting one another, as if there had beene a fault committed, which was questionlesse to be imposed on one of their shoulders: wherefore the Deputy commanded, or if you wil, wished S. <hi>I. Norris</hi> to prosecute the seruice in <hi>Vlster,</hi> whilst he retired to <hi>Dubline</hi> to prouide for the peace of the other Prouinces, but it preuailed little to the lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp the head of the maine body. For he performed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worthy the glory of his former reputation or dignity of so eminent a place: But whether the emulation of the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or fauouring the Earle to whome hee was as much inclined with respect, as the Deputy transported with hate: Or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he suspected the businesse in hand, the nature whereof, with the basenesse and intricate obscurity of the country, was so contrarious to the military proceedings elsewhere, and spent all mens spirits, without so much as the memory of manhood: or whether in inclination of fortune he began to stagger from his first firmenes, which in a customary defect dealeth strangely with such Commanders, somtimes heaping her fauours and prosperous successes, anon againe withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her happy hand, and by degrees extenuating both their valour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fame, and iudgement, I dispute not vpon.</p>
            <p>Only this I am sure of, that faire errors might lead them both: For the Deputy by reason of Sir <hi>Henry Bagnols</hi> and some others despight, was brought to looke vpon a very face of disloialty in <hi>Tirone,</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn Norris</hi> commiserated his misfortune, as abused with dissimulatory submissiue letters,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:21793:15"/>
in which the Earle was ready on his knees to any penitent prostitution, when yet vnder-hand hee implored the aid of <hi>Spaine,</hi> with warrantise, that if an Army were intended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>England,</hi> then to vnite their forces: if only warres were proclaymed and protraction vsed, then must the Catholike King supply them with men and money wherevpon <hi>O Roorck, Mac Williams,</hi> and others openly, and the Earle priuately sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed to a certaine instrument of Indenture, like ratification, giuing yet notice to the State of all these contracts, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, to which was added another parley with Sir <hi>Iohn Norris,</hi> and Sir <hi>Geffery Fenton</hi> Secretary in persons, full of very strange promises, and colluding protestations to runne a race of obedience and loyalty: all which accustomed <hi>Leuity</hi> hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringed, laying imputation vpon the discrepant humors of the Deputy and Lord Generall, but especially, that his onely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy the Marshall was returned from <hi>England</hi> with new forces, and inueterate malice against him.</p>
            <p>Whereupon by way of <hi>Apology,</hi> hee excused himselfe to the Councell of <hi>England,</hi> and vrged many iustifiable reasons (as he thought) for his discrepant proceedings, to which it should seem their answere was both distasting, and fearefull vnto him. For as it were exasperated rather then forewarned, he presently returned to his old courses, and taking great aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of our slacknesse, and ill prepared forces, spoiled the country, filled all the paces with Rebels, <hi>Barrocaded</hi> the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages, and with military excursions ran an vncontroulable iourney of doing what he pleased through the North.</p>
            <p>Thus was all <hi>Vlster</hi> and most part of <hi>Conach</hi> (excepting cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Garrisons) at his absolute command, vntil the Lord <hi>Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi> 1597. a man of a great spirit and quick capacity was sent Deputy into <hi>Ireland,</hi> from whose worth some auspicious expectation seemed to comfort vs, and new endeuours in a manner to warrant new fortunes: This sonne of <hi>Mars</hi> quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pulled off the clogs of delay, &amp; within two moneths rolled the stone of <hi>Tirones</hi> vnquietnesse, making way with great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrie and vertue into his country, fortifying the Fort of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:21793:15"/>
Black-water, and discouering this secret, that neyther his Boggs, Glinns, Woods, Mountaines, Paces, Confederats, or any power of <hi>Ireland,</hi> or <hi>Irish</hi> coadiutors could hide him from the searching eyes of <hi>England.</hi> Besides, if we would vndertake an industrious prosecution against him, it was neyther <hi>Spayne</hi> with her Gold, nor the <hi>Pope</hi> with his Fulminations against our Countrey, could secure him. For the farre reaching armes of our people would for a neede pull him out of the Center of the Earth: and thus accordingly euen at the first skirmishes were his forces dissipated, and the best troopes disranked: but as my Lord was giuing God thankes with a warlike so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, a sudden Alarum set them anew to worke, and <hi>Henry</hi> Earle of <hi>Kildare</hi> with the <hi>Gent. Volentiers</hi> had the Fortune to put him againe to flight, which yet yeelded not so full a satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, as it might haue done, because my Lord lost his brother in Law <hi>Francis Vaughan</hi> and Captaine <hi>Turner</hi> Serge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Maior, besides the Earle of <hi>Kildare</hi> to the sorrow of his heart saw two of his brethren wrapped vp in the Bed of blood, all men of worthy expectation, and extraordinary Merit.</p>
            <p>Thus is a way made into his Countrey, and Black-water Fort strengthened with new trenches, not without some ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts, and <hi>Caffamates,</hi> which the enemy so repined at, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene hope, feare, and shame, they resolued to dismantle it, had not the Lord Deputy opened more larger embracings, and with a new manner of wrestling resolued to lay him on the ground irrecouerably: but <hi>hinc illae lachrimae</hi>! as he was treading the measures of prosperity, an vntimely discord of Death sounding Musike deceiued him of hope, and vs of him, whose forwardnes and vertue with a little addition of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and solid vnderstanding himselfe, had no doubt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuated this <hi>Herculian</hi> labour of <hi>Irelands</hi> peace.</p>
            <p>Now is <hi>Tyrone</hi> putting on his <hi>Icarean</hi> wings, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell with accustomed Clamors taking aduantage of this Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim, assaulted Black-water Fort, but therein commanded that industrious Captaine <hi>Th. Williams,</hi> who at the same instant by meere valour, and resolution propulsed them, and many
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:21793:16"/>
times after, by patience and constancy endured all those mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes, where by a Souldier is put to the test, and enemy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth demonstration of his hate and policy. For when the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish</hi> found themselues vncapable of such a businesse, by way of expugnation, or assault, they tooke another course by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the passages to famish them; which when the <hi>English</hi> vnderstood, they were as resolute to affront all mischances, as the enemy was violent in contriuing displeasures, and so with noble stedfastnesse bare vp a head against the streame of sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and wants, eating Horses and Weedes, and if it had beene possible, the very durt and stones.</p>
            <p>In this time the gouernment of <hi>Ireland</hi> was in the hands of the Earle of <hi>Ormond,</hi> as Lieutenant Generall of the Army: the Lord Chancelor and Sir <hi>Robert Gardner</hi> Iustices, to whom the Earle of <hi>Tyrone</hi> by many dilatory Letters did lay open all his grieuances, touching sparingly his breach of promise with Sir <hi>Iohn Norris,</hi> and all the effectuall points of his disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and refractary courses: To these Letters hee receiued answere, which hee interpreted displeasing rather then satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory, and so accordingly entred into further Rebellious actions, pressing Black-water Fort again with a more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous siedge, against whom the Lord Lieutenant and Iustices aforesaid sent Sir <hi>Henry Bagnoll</hi> the Marshall, his only reputed aduersary, with sixteene Companies of Foot, and foure troops of Horse, who aduancing forward more malicious then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, as ouerwrought by a predestinated wilfulnesse, came to blowes, and according to the slippery footing of Warre, fel to a dangerous Skirmish, in which <hi>Tyrone</hi> shouldred him with all his strength nigh vnto <hi>Armagh,</hi> determining as it were to punish his Enuy, and supposed abuses against him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it should seeme the Mistrisse of successe (as we abuse Gods prouidence by the Character of <hi>Fortune</hi>) was coadiutrix, and displayed all the maligne circumstances of reuenge against vs. For ere night decided the controuersy, hee triumphed with a notorious victory, whereby in one houre the Marshall ended his brauery, life, and enmity: nor could the <hi>Irish</hi> euer boast of a more conspicuous triumph since the <hi>Conquest,</hi> or if
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:21793:16"/>
you had rather haue it so, since we first curb'd their immanity: For we lost fifteene Captaines, and 1500. Souldiers, ouer whom the manner of insulting was more barbarous then the accident tyrannous.</p>
            <p>Presently followed the surrendring of Black-water Fort, when the besieged saw all reliefe debarred them, and heard, how <hi>Tyrone</hi> was proclaymed the deliuerer of his Countrey and Protector of the <hi>Catholique</hi> cause, seeming the very darling of prosperity and delight of <hi>Bellona,</hi> wherein he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded accordingly, making all the Kingdome witnesse his glory and renowne. For hee presently sent <hi>Ouny-Mac Roory Oge,</hi> and <hi>Tirrill</hi> into <hi>Munster</hi> with foure thousand Rebels, against whom the Lord President Sir <hi>Iohn Norris</hi> (hauing lost his brother by sicknesse, or as some suppose, a disastrous Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy) with reasonable equipage, and orderly attendance set nobly forward: but the enemy not appearing, he retired to <hi>Corck,</hi> and diuiding his Army into seuerall Garrisons, gaue them liberty to take aduantage of our wearisomnesse and impatience. For presently they proceeded to all hatefull courses of sauage outrage, and after <hi>Iames Fitz-Thomas</hi> a Rebell of that House was proclaymed Earle of <hi>Desmond,</hi> who thereupon acknowledged <hi>Oneale</hi> his benefactor, and superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, they returned with ambitious alacrity, and cheerefulnesse, and sent word into <hi>Spayne</hi> of their admirable successes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Tyrone</hi> behaued himselfe so audaciously, that he interdicted the peace of <hi>England,</hi> as if there had beene a way opened vnto an easy conquest of the same, and the first steppe into <hi>Ireland</hi> would helpe them vp the degrees of a more illustrious glorie, to which purpose the King of <hi>Spayne</hi> should not onely bee assured of the <hi>Popes</hi> blessing, but <hi>Oneales</hi> Fortunes and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, yea the whole power of the Kingdome.</p>
            <p>This was the lamentable estate of <hi>Ireland,</hi> when her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty taking pitty of her Orphan Countrey, substituted <hi>Robert</hi> Earle of <hi>Essex,</hi> whom the successe of <hi>Cales</hi> voyage, and many other memorable designes and prosecutions had worthily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned, her Lieutenant Generall of <hi>Ireland:</hi> But how hee had formerly wound himselfe into the good opinion of his

Countrey, how <hi>England</hi> looked vpon him as a glorious sonne of comlinesse and honour, how his forces, Treasure, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours were extraordinary in this proiect of <hi>Ireland,</hi> how hee proceeded in this military race, how the applause of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the greatest part of the nobilitie attended him: How a sudden storme, as if some ominous signe from Heauen pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saged misfortune, intercepted his iollity euen at his first set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of <hi>London</hi>: how landed in <hi>Ireland</hi> hee beganne his businesse as preposterously: How that braue Sir <hi>Coniers Clif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> was abused by presumption, and ouer-credulous opinion, that his bosome friend <hi>O Roorck</hi> would not haue prooued such a Traytor, and so not only lost his life at the <hi>Curlews</hi> a boggy Mountaine by the <hi>Abby</hi> of <hi>Aborle</hi>: but was inhumane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after the skirmish mangled, and with great immanity cut in peeces: How the Earle of <hi>Ormond,</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Haring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> were surprized and taken prisoners by <hi>Harry Oge: Owny mac Roory,</hi> and the sonnes of <hi>Feff mac-Heugh</hi> rebells vnited a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the peace and flourishing prosperity of <hi>Lemster</hi>: How hee came to a priuate parley with <hi>Tyrone,</hi> and was much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by the <hi>Irish</hi>: How her Maiesty rebuked him, and from incensed indignation challenged both his loyalty, and the wisedome of the Councell of <hi>Ireland</hi> for a contrarious and vntoward method of gouernment, and prosecutions in the North: How his glorious celebrating the feast of Saint <hi>George</hi> in the City of <hi>Dubline,</hi> considering the times and turmoyles of the kingdome, was imputed rather an ostentous brauery, then a necessary honour: How contrary to expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hee comes into <hi>England</hi> after a priuate prohibition by her Maiesties owne Letters: How hee was commanded to his owne House, and his Offices dispensed withall: How his sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows multiplied: How the peoples loue encreased eyther from a generall commiserating of such men in distresse, or particular apprehension of his greatnesse, and worth: How his fortunes and Life ended: I will leaue to a Story of it selfe, yea if I might say so, to many Stories, in which such infinite obseruations might bee folded, that if a man durst or might spread them abroad, all the passages should be laid open and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:21793:17"/>
exposed to publique ouerlooking, of the fauour and disfauor of Princes, the dangers of men insatiable of glory, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Councellours, emulous of one anothers greatnesse, the mutability and inconstancy of popularitie, the perill wherein men plunge themselues, that dare presume to perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate vniustifiable actions, and the misery, which an vntimely death bringeth to a man projecting high matters to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. But to our Irish businesse againe.</p>
            <p>When my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> troubles were published abroad and divulged in <hi>Ireland:</hi> the Earle of <hi>Tirone</hi> with great indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation brake the truce of his Country, raised his forces, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred his Rebells, rumored the inuasion of <hi>England</hi> by <hi>Spaine,</hi> and audaciously set open all the passages of war and defiance, whereupon the Traytours increased both in pride and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and those which were meere <hi>Irish,</hi> expected their pristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate liberty: such againe as had settled their estates, either by purchase or gift of the Prince, began to misdoubt themselues, when they perceiued such a confluence and concurrence of tumultuary businesse to the detriment of the Kingdome: yea, I am afrayd they were without all hope in their hearts, when <hi>Tirone</hi> proclaimed himselfe Protector of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and Maintainer of the Catholique Religion: nor was this onely titular, and a formall tricke of vaine promises and flattering friends. For he proceeded accordingly, imperiously mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging all affaires vnder his gouernment: the rebellious he mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated, the weake supported, the strong confirmed, the stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering reduced, the wilfull punished, and (in a word) applied himselfe altogether to the extirpation of the <hi>English:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he was animated, by assured intelligence of preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in <hi>Spaine,</hi> and the receiuing a competent treasure from thence. Nor wanted there certaine indulgences and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses from the Pope, to set his desire on a blaze: but when for a present hee had receiued an hollowed Phoenix plume, with <hi>Ixion</hi> that boasted of lying with <hi>Iuno,</hi> being yet deceiued with the shape of a clowd, hee presaged good fortune, and ranne away with full confidence of successe, and the rather, because hee remembred, how <hi>Vrban</hi> the third had sent King <hi>Iohn</hi> a
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:21793:18"/>
crowne of peacockes feathers at his designation, for the Lordship of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus marched he ouer the Countrey, with extraordinarie preuailing, and vnaccustomed pomp, for an Irish Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, with new publications of his regardable proceedings, and Princely confirmations. And to adde fuell to that fire, which in his absence was kindled in <hi>Munster,</hi> he went thither in person, and vnder colour of visiting a peece of the crosse of Christ in <hi>Tiperary,</hi> attempted further, sending <hi>Mac-Guior</hi> to forage the country, who chancing on S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Warrham Selenger,</hi> fell to blowes, and in gallant encounter, charged one another so brauely, that with their staues they equally received their deaths wounds through their bodies, which a while curbed <hi>Tirones</hi> headstrongnesse, and peraduenture was cause of his sooner retiring home, after he had celebrated <hi>Mac-Guiors</hi> exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies: but in truth the aduertisement of the Earle of <hi>Ormonds</hi> comming against him with all the <hi>English</hi> forces rebated his first forwardnesse, and made him suspect all was not so well as he wished: but yet animated by many superstitious presages, and giuing all credit to his Bards and Rimers, of which sort of people, especially if I adde the Priests, I will bee bolde to say thus much, that they are the very bane and confusion of <hi>Ireland,</hi> liuing in such obscenity and filthinesse, that no Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman thinketh herselfe happy without them, and suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth it no disgrace euen to bee prostituted vnto them: Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that ill custome (besides the intolerable yoke of super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition, to which these people are out of measure addicted) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing got the vpperhand, these insorcering wretches at marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, feasts, births of children, contracts, burialls, and perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture all their liues time, challenge certaine priuiledges, immunities and gifts; yea, priuacies with the women, and imperious ouerruling the men: So that as their families en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease in mightinesse, these damnable creatures prosper in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, as if all blessings depended vpon their incantations and prayers, &amp; no action could thriue without their crossings and sanctifying: So that (in my conscience) the most of the rebells and strumpets amongst them, are the bastards of these
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:21793:18"/>
rogues and vagabonds: and all the treasons, which haue tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiled our Nation, haue receiued life and originall from their imposturing and perswasions.</p>
            <p>By this time is S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Charles Blunt</hi> Lord <hi>Montioy</hi> confirmed Deputy of <hi>Ireland,</hi> on whom long since the Queene had loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with respect for the same purpose: But the Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> proposing to himselfe the managing of all military affaires, somewhat couertly impugned the same, extenuated his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in the warres, and that hee onely had a view of some skirmishes in the Low Countries: Besides, his spirit was not stirring enough to curb such a Nation, as giuen ouer much to his booke, and a kinde of retired melancholy, rather fit for ciuill gouernment, then violent hurliburlies: All which wiped not yet out the print of her good opinion; but shee went for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in her choyce, and made the election more notable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause her owne iudgement affoorded sufficient reason of his merit: onely she proposed before him, by way of caution, my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> wilfulnesse, and in a manner presumption, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctizing diuers things against her liking and prescription, and so alike restrained his commission, and by word of mouth commanded his charines and wisdom, concerning the knigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of men, which must needes be vilipended, brought once to a community; as for any hinderances, by the maleuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent aspect of single Councellours, shee promised on her Princely word, that shee would bee the Queene of her King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and no man should contract a brow of mislike, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile in any secret information against him: whereupon hee was much comforted, and well hoped, that that enmity which was whispered betweene M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Secretary and him, I meane S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Robert Cecill,</hi> might be easily reconciled, and (as it were) like the swet of a mans browes wiped away with a gentle hand, which accordingly came to passe. For when certaine honest men performed good offices betweene them, neuer man ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued such a Councellour of State, better than my Lord did him, nor such a greatnesse honoured a person in such an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent place, then M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Secretary did my Lord: so that to their dying dayes their friendship was indissoluble, and as they lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:21793:19"/>
one another, so both respected the glory of their country before one another.</p>
            <p>Thus without any publique ostentation, or great atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy, in the month of February 1600. he tooke his iourney toward <hi>Ireland,</hi> and was welcommed to our true-hearted <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,</hi> as you see a famous Physician presented to a sicke pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, who hath long expected his comming. For hee found <hi>Ireland</hi> so desperate languishing, that he rather feared her fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals then recouery, which must bee so at this instant, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the very best did droop with despaire, and the worst insulted with pride: <hi>Tyrone</hi> passed and repassed without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troll, and the Rebell had nothing in his mouth, but the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Inuasion,</hi> and that <hi>Tyrone</hi> should bee the Prince of their Countrey vnder the Catholique King: whereupon to exaspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the new Deputy, and terrifie him at the first, they gaue an assault to the suburbs of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and the Alarum rung euen to the Castle, where my Lord was resident, which indeede so much incensed him, that he resolued to intercept his returne out of <hi>Munster,</hi> whatsoeuer chanced; and so gathering toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the rest of the dispersed forces, and taking along such Gentlemen as came with him out of <hi>England,</hi> he marched into <hi>Fereall</hi> (for you must consider the maine army was with my Lord of <hi>Ormond</hi> in <hi>Munster</hi>) and determined to see the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>Tyrones</hi> returning home into his Countrey, but was preuented by the admirable expedition hee made. For certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of all our proceedings, not without some ampliation of my Lords power and authority, as in all such cases it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that new Gouernours are not onely extolled, but an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of a thousand by poll, shall be made two thousand by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, he quickly procured a shelter for the storme which was threatned, and euen ready to powre vpon him, and so taking the way of <hi>Lease,</hi> and the skirts of <hi>Meath,</hi> posted into the <hi>North.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When my Lord Deputy was thus frustrated of his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, he returned to <hi>Dublin,</hi> and after orderly consultation, concluded to send forces by sea to <hi>Logh-Foile</hi> and <hi>Balishanon,</hi> as also to <hi>Logh-Erne,</hi> to visit <hi>Lease</hi> and <hi>Ophaly,</hi> to restore
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:21793:19"/>
               <hi>Munster,</hi> and fortifie <hi>Conach,</hi> which as they were designes of wonderfull consequence; so must as wonderfull wisdome of men, and prouidence of God effectuate the same, and bring to a happy period. Thus was all <hi>Ireland,</hi> like a turbulent sea full of billowes, euen to the very shores, and the Rebell vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both Countrey and Inhabitants: the country was spoiled, ouerrunne, and in most parts depopulated; insomuch that in diuers places, twenty mile together, not so much as a bird ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared; the inhabitants were slaine, rauished, enforced, and robbed: insomuch that neither house, nor Church, except some few castles and townes in speciall mens hands, remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vpright: but were burnt, ruined, and deuasted.</p>
            <p>When my Lord Deputy (to make my first <hi>simile</hi> hold cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondency) felt the pulses so strong of this disquieted body, and vnderstood the state of the same by outward and inward demostration: his principall care was, to reduce the distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature, and coole the heat, if it were possible, of this burning feauer; for which purpose hee conferred with the Councell, and after orderly and prouident furnishing his army with munition, garons, and seuerall prouision: he determined in person, and with all speedinesse, sometimes the onely strength and life of all difficult enterprizes, to encounter the enemy; but especially to diuert <hi>Tyrone</hi> from intercepting S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Henry Dockeray,</hi> at <hi>Logh-Foile</hi>; and S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Matthew Morgan,</hi> at <hi>Balisha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>: whereupon in the beginning of May (an early time to bring an army into the field) hee marched toward <hi>Vlster,</hi> and pressed the Rebell with so many skirmishes, that they were wonderfully dispersed, and against all expectation confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: Thus had hee leasure, in the midst of Iune, to march backe againe into <hi>Lease,</hi> the onely refuge of the Rebels of <hi>Lemster,</hi> where with admirable successe he preuailed against that turbulent, cruell, and bloudy young man <hi>Ony-Mac-Roory-Oge,</hi> the cheefe of the family of <hi>O-more,</hi> who had so lately disturbed the peace of all <hi>Munster</hi>; to whom, with other his most pestilent and impious confederates, did our Deputy read a lesson of Iustice, and taught rebellion other principles of conformity, then either they were willing to learne, or had
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:21793:20"/>
beene before orderly enstructed in: by which occasion <hi>Bello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> began to giue vs better entertainment, and already there appeared a declining of the others prosperity: Thus was the God of battells propitious vnto vs, and the sunne of comfort by degrees chased away the foggy mists of despaire and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spight; so that euery mans heart was cheered, and they which held downe their heads full low in the time of mistrust and affliction, I meane the <hi>Irish-English</hi> themselues in the pale, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to stand vpright for ioy, and flocked to the court in troops, to welcome my Lord Deputy home, and applauded the prosperity of his attempts; yea, to speake without flattery, to impute the happinesse to his vertue and wisdome.</p>
            <p>In the midst of this iollity, new supplies out of <hi>England</hi> gaue more aire to successe, which had beene so long smoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered betweene malignant circumstances of time, and ill conditions of men deuoted to priuate ends. For this is most certaine, that in the vncertainty of our preuailing, when the gouernment of <hi>Ireland</hi> seemed layd at the stake, howeuer the better sort kept correspondency with vs, and professed a kinde of glory in participating with our misfortunes, yet did they vnderhand not onely releeue <hi>Tyrone,</hi> but contracted for their owne security, if any alteration should chance; yea, in some of our extremities, they behaued themselues so audaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, and yet with an vntoward policy, that when they were sent for to march with the army, they made dilatory excuses, and many times denied such attendance, as if they had busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse sufficient to keepe their owne territories from robbery and spoiles. But our worthy Deputy againe, with these new troops, he vndertooke the iourney of the <hi>Moiry,</hi> three miles beyond <hi>Dondalk:</hi> and attempted an impetuous assault, which continued with many dangerous and violent skirmishes. For his horse was shot vnder him, his Secretary slaine by him, his friends wounded, and diuers Commanders hurt; yet he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured all, and the God of heauen endured him, so that at the last, with a memorable slaughter and fortunate victory, hee enforced them from his fastnesse.</p>
            <p>Presently finding sweet beginnings to breath life into acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:21793:20"/>
he marched to <hi>Armagh,</hi> and tumbled those hindrances on to side, which had made that passage so noysome, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he would maintaine an old position:
<q>
                  <l>Non minor est virtus, quam quaerere, parta tueri:</l>
               </q>
He built a fort called Mount <hi>Norris,</hi> within eight miles of the Newry, and in a manner the mid-way to <hi>Armagh,</hi> in honour of that worthy Generall, vnder whom he was introducted on the martiall theater. In his returne (passing ouer many light skirmishes) neere vnto <hi>Carlingford,</hi> hee preuailed with a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable defeature of the rest, and so stored the castles with strong wards, making the narrow water passible, and sending the pestilent <hi>Kerne</hi> lurking in euery corner, to seeke for better shelter. For these new and terrible stormes, had shattered their olde couerts, and almost beaten them to peeces ouer their heads.</p>
            <p>Not long after, in the midst of winter, he coasted into the <hi>Glins</hi> by <hi>Dublin,</hi> where <hi>Donnell-Spaniah-Phelin,</hi> and <hi>Raymond-Mac-Feugh,</hi> with that pestilent rabble of <hi>O-Tooles,</hi> held such a quarter, that no man before him had either leisure to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranke them, or sufficient forces to raise them from their firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: these yet he subdued, reduced, and led them by strong hand to such a way of obedience, that Sir <hi>Henry Harrington</hi> vnder him went quietly to <hi>Newcastle,</hi> and had the principall command ouer them; yea, I can assure you were glad to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uited to the pleasures of his peace and entertainment, and <hi>Raymond-Mac-Feugh,</hi> as I take it, was his tenant for <hi>Baltinglas,</hi> and gloried in nothing more, then that hee had sworne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe a true subiect to the Maiestie of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, he hasted into <hi>Feriall,</hi> where the Rebell <hi>Tirrell</hi> was pulled out of his darke corners into the open light of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfiture, and in the end compelled into <hi>Vlster,</hi> to the great Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mander of their facinorous enterprizes, whither his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship followed with admiration, and preuailed with all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantages of a fortunate Captaine. For, in truth, he attempted nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but preuailed: and with the Centurion in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell, said to this man, go; and he went: to that, do this; and he did it: so that if a man would then haue catalogued his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:21793:21"/>
hee might thus haue set downe the Items of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, which I am the bolder to doe, because I cannot incurre the imputation of flattery, not a man remaining, that I know, to reward me, nor will not obscure the worthinesse of vertue in a Generall so compleat and well assisted by all the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of honour and renowne.</p>
            <p>First then, (yet I doe not presume of order, nor tie my selfe to the strictnesse of time) hee conquered the <hi>Feriall,</hi> by the death of the two sonnes of <hi>Euer-Mac-Codey.</hi> Hee subdued the Rebels of the <hi>Fuse,</hi> and receiued to grace <hi>Turlogh-Mac-Henry:</hi> he laid open the <hi>Breny,</hi> and taught vs a way to march ouer their boggs, yea to bring our cannons ouer their deepest mires, as my selfe was an eye-witnesse in <hi>Conagh</hi> before <hi>O-Kel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies</hi> owne castle: he restored <hi>Tredagh,</hi> and made those vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant people ashamed of their willingnesse to become hispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niolized: hee reduced <hi>Leiale,</hi> pardoning <hi>Magennis</hi> that vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped there, and set open their prowdest fastnes: yea, their paces and mountaines were made easie, in despight of natures diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and mens policies: hee tooke to mercy <hi>Mac-Mahond,</hi> and the <hi>O-Realies,</hi> knighting that olde S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Patrick O-Hanland,</hi> and corroborating all their loues as farre as he went: hee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled the Rebells from <hi>Armagh,</hi> fortifying the same with <hi>English,</hi> and came to <hi>Blackwater</hi> Sconce, where <hi>Tirone</hi> was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cunningly encamped: but <hi>arsdeluditur arte,</hi> and he remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him in despight, casting vp more sufficient trenches, and left it once againe in the fast holding armes of Captaine <hi>Th: Williams</hi>: hee made <hi>Lease</hi> and <hi>Ophaly</hi> proud of their peace and prosperity: so that the Inhabitants still gathered themselues vnder the couert of <hi>English</hi> protection: he set open the <hi>Glins,</hi> and made the <hi>Brens</hi> and <hi>Tooles,</hi> with other inficious Rebells ashamed to put any confidence in deuices, or reaches of mens braines. For God had ordained the pride of life, to be subiect to alteration, and the presumption of men to bee patible of counterchecking. To conclude, in a word, howeuer other men were vertue-worthy, and valiant enough: yet this our Lord <hi>Montioy</hi> was questionlesse more fortunate, as wee are sensible of that terme, then any man since S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Henry Sidney's</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:21793:21"/>
times, yet I may not ouerpasse that memorable Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> whose noble spirit seemed to flie in the face of his enemies, and dimmed the sight of the <hi>Spanyards</hi> in <hi>Smirwick</hi> and other places of <hi>Ireland,</hi> who had in those times a determination to pry into euery corner of the Countrey, and settle the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their great Master amongst vs, if it were possible. Thus Fortune ashamed of her first churlish entertainment, welcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him to the pleasures of a more conuenient lodging, and gaue vs all hope of his perpetuity in the palace of reputation, which in that manner, as you haue heard, hee tooke posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tirone,</hi> notwithstanding, was not altogether exanimated: for what he could not with the lyons, her performed with the foxes skin, and according to an olde filthy principle:
<q>
                  <l>Tutum per scelera sceleribus est iter:</l>
               </q>
He cared not what course he tooke, or tracke hee paced in, so <hi>England</hi> might be disturbed, and his owne fortunes and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse maintained: whereupon, as in many places you haue heard, hee tampered with <hi>Spaine</hi> for the corroborating his power, and imploying many Agents, who brought the Popes letters to the same purpose, effected thus much; that money was sent him, as a preparation, and money should follow, as a full purgation of the diseases of his discontentment, which made him stand the more remote from reconciliation, &amp; vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipend my Lord Deputy, as the Substitute of <hi>England,</hi> whom yet he honoured and admired, as the indefatigable seruant of honour, which <hi>Epitheton</hi> I must needs vse, because how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer iolly spirits, viewing onely city musters, cry out,
<q>
                  <l>Dulce bellum inexpertis,—</l>
               </q>
Yet in the worthinesse of fearefull imployment, is this an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation beyond report, and no Labourer, Pioner, or Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer in any mechanicke trade, did euer take such paines, as my Lord: but I may well say with the Poet,
<q>
                  <l>Hectora quis nosset? foelix si Troia fuisset?</l>
                  <l>Ardua per preceps gloria tendit iter:</l>
               </q>
For amongst other vertues in a Generall, patience and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance are the true touch-stones of the currantnesse of the

rest: now because fortune would needs search him throughly, to make triall of his constancy, or to increase his glory, the certainty of the <hi>Spanyards</hi> landing in <hi>Munster,</hi> and onely life of <hi>Tirones</hi> whole actions, taxed him with further businesse, and fixed all the eyes of the Kingdome, both honest and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute, vpon his proceedings heerein, and hopefull successe to preuaile vnexpected.</p>

            <p>You shall onely now bee certified, what this angry <hi>Ionas</hi> did, after his gourd was withered, and how with others of that sort, he drenched himselfe in the whirlepoole of confusion, when his <hi>Spanish</hi> props were shrunke, or bladders taken away. His first retreat was into such countryes, and to such persons, as he was sure of releefe, both from the nature of charity and commiseration, and the bond of duty and former gratuity; from whence with some adoe, (because his souldiers were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men looking after a prey, then subiect to the disaster of a defeat) hee got home againe with little interception of our

side, the army as yet resident at <hi>Corcke,</hi> or thereabouts, but when he came to <hi>Dungannon,</hi> the walls seemed to weepe for his disaster, that well hoped to haue beene new coloured with the trophees of his rebellion.</p>
            <p>My Lord Deputy returned to <hi>Dublin.</hi> and as it was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site and most necessary, celebrated S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Georges</hi> Feast, and by way of thanksgiuing welcommed all the Gentlemen of the Pale, who durst not but giue God the praise, and him the renowne of the victory: by which occasion <hi>Tirones</hi> procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings had no such couerture, but they all (as it were) in a glasse, saw the change and alteration of fortune, making this vse thereof, that there is no confidence in worldly prosperity; Nor must a man be too much elated, though terrestriall bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings seeme to make his cup to ouerflow. For the man, that of late proclaimed himselfe Protector of the ancient liberty of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and Defender of the Romish Religion, that for the same purpose led whole armies into the field, and displayed the coulours of a most dangerous innouation: that posted and reposted through the Kingdome at his pleasure, as if Maiesty meant to kisse him in the chaire of successe: that was glorious in the eyes of his owne people, famous to other Nations, and a very terrour to the English Inhabitants of <hi>Ireland:</hi> that was coadiuted with the purse, nauy, countenance, and an army of six thousand well appoynted souldiers from a mighty Prince: that was emboldned with the loue and admiration of his own followers: that tooke aduantage of our first slacke procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings to debilitate his insolence, and that promised himselfe the very harbour of felicity, as being in the high way of esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment; was now subiect to distresse, and bowed vnder the burthen of mischance, and vntoward alteration.</p>
            <p>For my Lord Deputy presently followed him into his owne countrey, and, as I remember the brauery of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, vpon his writing of <hi>Plus vltra,</hi> when the West Indies were discouered, where as before the great <hi>Hercules</hi> had set vp his pillers at <hi>Gades</hi> in <hi>Spaine,</hi> with this inscription: <hi>Non plus vltra:</hi> so may I apply it vnto this our Generall, who comming now to <hi>Blackwater</hi> Fort, cried <hi>Plus vltra,</hi> wheras before none

In the fulnes of this prosperity, he built the Fort of <hi>Mountioy,</hi> &amp; fortified in many places of this dangerous country, driuing him with the rest of his followers into more remote places<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the obscure corners of his <hi>Glan Cancones,</hi> to which when he added the cutting vp of the corn, which the cheerefull souldiers performed with their swords, and taking away their cowes, of which they had good store, it is admirable to tell you what miseries followed, and the whole people endured. For their sword-men perished with sicknesse and famine the next yeere following, and the poore <hi>Calliots</hi> deuoured one another for meere hunger, and shewed vs the lamentable effects of a calamitous warre and afflicted Countrey.</p>
            <p>Thus was <hi>Tirone</hi> made the tennis-ball of fortune, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned of <hi>Spaines</hi> ouerprized greatnesse: thus did hee see the losse of his armies, and the miseries of his people: thus was he deiected from the pride of his possessions, and repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to behold his aduersary seated in his castles and townes:
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:21793:24"/>
thus was hee forsaken of his friends, kinred, and complices, and confined into the vncouth and remote places of his bogs and woods: thus was hee afraid of betraying, euen of those which leaned on his bosome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> especially when the state bandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, and valued his head at a thousand pound sterling, and his body aliue at two thousand pound: and thus was hee made the scorne of alteration, and spectacle of humane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, hauing nothing left but a poore disconsolate life, which it should seeme the Law of nature assisted him to maintaine, otherwise a Romane spirit, in spight of mischance, had ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come distresse with a glorious death.</p>
            <p>But time had not fully ripened as yet his fruit, nor brought forward the haruest, that should gather in this dispersed corne: For this great tormented Rebell, with strange demisnesse, sought his peace at the hands of his long abused Soueraigne, &amp; with new teares begged a new life, nor was this submission ordinary after the custom of a souldiers misfortune<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but (as it were) blotted with the spots of a guilty co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science, &amp; interlined with a strange manner of feareful penitency, repleat with exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crations against the cause of his misleading, and terrors of his offence, not without teares from his eyes, drops of bloud from his heart, and curses from his very soule, in demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his remorse, with protestations of better conformity, with vowes and dangerous oaths for his loyalty, with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent assurances for his obedience, and with all the cunning that art, meanes, circumstances, and insinuation accustometh in attracting pardon.</p>
            <p>This strange newes was nothing acceptable to her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty: For shee had rather haue seene his body on the ground headlesse, then himselfe succourlesse and on his knees beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of pardon, because my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> had promised as much, and out of her owne greatnesse, shee scorned to bee so affronted with a subiect, and naked Rebell, as she might well terme him: yea, the Councell of her State had many times vrged the facility of the matter, and suggested against my Lord of <hi>Essex,</hi> by way of exaggerating his offences, with this one slacknesse in the midst of his troubles: so that now to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:21793:24"/>
take him to mercy, after so much treasure disbursed, so many subiects slaine, so vntoward disturbance renewed, so wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full reports dispersed, so famous an action discredited, and in a word, the whole frame of her gouernment abused; was an vnsauoury demand, &amp; absolutely contrary to her expectation, especially when shee had beene wrought to the permission of her copper treasure in <hi>Ireland,</hi> esteemed the breake-necke of the Rebells designes, and a meere demonstration of our wants in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when the Councell vrged the necessity of the time, the situation of the Countrey, the fearefulnesse of further mischeefe, the inconueniences of new troubles, the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the <hi>Spanyard,</hi> the new intercession of the Papists for another inuasion, the discontents of the <hi>Irish</hi> themselues, for all these triumphs: her princely disposition was ouerwrought to a reflecting commiseration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so that against the customes of incensed Maiesty, shee admitted of his prostituted homage, and with some wonderment at the wretchednesse of Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, and vicissitude of all things, she gaue way to his resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, with directions to the Deputy, to entertaine him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, so he made sute for the same, and that it might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to the world, she was an absolute Queene of her King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and howeuer Rebells might haue ttayterous hearts supported by forrain coadiutement, yet could no subiect haue powerfull hands to pull the peace of her kingdomes in peeces, or touch the skirts of her throne to disturb her in her establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed mightinesse.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Tirone</hi> vnderstood, that he must alter his compasse, and turne his sailes to another coast, hee then imployed his brother <hi>Arthur Mac Baron,</hi> and others of the best of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and neerest of his affinity, as Agents of his peace and protection, who diuers times repulsed, when remembrance layd open his former exorbitant actions, desisted not yet from excuses of precedent occurrences, and forcible intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the necessity of his present actions, nor left they out the true manner of his now penitency, and all their willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to make him, as it were, a new creature, and vnite them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:21793:25"/>
in one combination for the acknowledging the supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority of <hi>England:</hi> whereby at last that obdurate heart of our Deputy, which at first seemed impenetrable, was deflected and cast in a more gentle molde, so that he appoynted <hi>Melli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant</hi> by <hi>Tredagh,</hi> where Sir <hi>Garret Moore</hi> was resident, to bee the schoole house of his conformity, and place without other condition, then submitting to the Queenes mercy, to admit of his repentance: whither, at the time appointed, resorted our noble Lord Deputy well attended, for the better grace of his eminent greatnesse, and the person he presented: thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther came also <hi>Tirone</hi> with some few Lords of the North, a spectacle of mischance and terrour to the pride of man, who supposeth glory and ostentation the felicity of this world, or presumeth on wealth and authority, the very poison of our best endeauours: Nor was it with him, as I remember the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusing Poet in his disticke touching offenders cries out:
<q>
                  <l>Confugit interdum templi violator ad aram,</l>
                  <l>Nec petere offensi niminis horret opem:</l>
               </q>
For, as the case stood, his offence and fault was the more hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and condemnatory, because his Prince was a woman, and one to whom he had diuers times been beholding for his life, and in the doubtfulnesse of his first admission to his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritances, saw the dore of her treasury and magnificent bounty set open for him. But to the purpose.</p>
            <p>At the first entrance into the roome, euen at the threshold of the doore, hee prostrated himselfe groueling to the earth, with such a deiected countenance, that the standers by were amazed, and my Lord Deputy himselfe had much a doe to remember the worke in hand. For whether the sight of so many Captaines and Gentlemen, whether ashamed of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, when he saw such a number of his owne nation specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of his wretchednesse, whether the consideration of his fortunes, that had thus embased him contrary to expectation: whether the view of my Lord to be his Iudge, whom once he reputed to be at his mercy: whether hee repented this course of submission, and degenerating begging of life, when a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble death had beene both honourable, and the determiner of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:21793:25"/>
misery: or whether mans naturall imperfection, to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded and altred with affliction, depressed his spirits, I know not, but it was one of the deplorablest sights that euer I saw: and to looke vpon such a person, the author of so much trouble, and so formerly glorious, so deiected, would haue wrought many changes in the stoutest heart, and did no doubt at this instant raise a certain commiseration in his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test aduersary.</p>
            <p>After a while the Deputy beckned him to come neere: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue it, hee arose: but with such degrees of humility, as if misfortune had taught him cunning to grace his aduersity. For he passed not two steps, before hee yeelded to a new pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, which might well bee called a groueling to the ground, and so, by diuided ceremonies, fell on his knees, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning an apology for some of his actions, but at euery word confessing, in how many treasons hee had plunged himselfe, offending God and her Maiesty, how hee had abused her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, disturbed her Kingdome, disobeyed her lawes, wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged her subiects, abandoned all ciuility, and wrapped him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in the very tarriers of destruction; so that nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, but to flie to the refuge of her Princely clemency, which had so often restored both his life and honour.</p>
            <p>Heere my Lord Deputy intercepted his oratory, with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming all circumlocution, or defence of the courses he had so disorderly vndertaken; nay, he would not heare a word of iustifying his dependancy on <hi>Spaine,</hi> or admission of that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity toward <hi>England,</hi> withall applying some instructions worthy so great a Commanders name, intermingled with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions full of authority &amp; eloquence, he admitted him to stand neerer, and (after an houre or more) gaue him leaue to be couered, vsing him with honourable respect, both at his bord &amp; priuate conferences, and so within two daies brought him as a trophe of his victories into <hi>Dublin,</hi> with a full resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to carry him into <hi>England,</hi> and present him to her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie.</p>
            <p>But now is the Sunne of that glory ecclipsed, and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine prouidence thought it meet to take her into his owne
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:21793:26"/>
protection. For after she had liued and raigned, to the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of all nations, and filled the world with the fame of her vertues foure and forty yeeres, and renowne of life three-score and ten, shee was ordained for a better Kingdome, and the foure and twenty day of March 1602. went to take pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of it. My Lord had notice long before of her decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which peraduenture was an incitation the rather for the taking in of <hi>Tirone,</hi> though he vnderstood not so much. So this great Queene, the Wonder of Time, the Admiration of her Sex, the Help of all Nations, the Princesse of Fame, the Mistrisse of Honour, the Terror of Antechrist, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandrix of Fortune, left her name euerlasting, and dignity vnmatchable. For (beleeue it) what forraine Prince soeuer, more then to admire her, shall striue to imitate her, will but wrong Maiesty, and discouer this imperfection, that emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is comitant to vertue, and when wee cannot attaine to the transcendency of anothers excellency, wee fall to vilipen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the worth, and malicious calumniation of the goodnes: and heerein let <hi>England</hi> reioyce, that the starre of dignity, and fame of those times, was set vnder her climate by her death, and in her life she treasured such iewels of estimation, that the storehouses of other palaces could not discouer, or shew the like.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Rome,</hi> and some defamatory inuentions of <hi>Spaine</hi>; the poyson hath returned to their owne preiudice, like him which spitting against the winde, found his face besmeered with the reflexion. For, the better sort both misliked <hi>Parsons</hi> and other English Priests, in their degenerating inuectiues, and stopped the mouths of inferiours, for once breathing amisse against her Maiesty, which makes mee remember a worthy reprehension of Count <hi>Mansfield</hi> toward Captaine <hi>Rowland Yorke,</hi> forbidding him some loosnesse of speech a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his Queene, and when he transgressed further in vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencies of fault-finding, both with the gouernment and life of her Maiesty: in plainer termes he assured him, that the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms of his table wold admit of no irregular behauior against Princes: Nor can I forget Duke <hi>Byrons</hi> admiration, who at
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:21793:26"/>
his returne into <hi>France,</hi> plainely diuulged, that the Court of <hi>England</hi> spred abroad the coulours of Maiesty indeed, and all others were but a heap of confusion, and diseased mixture of vnseemely familiarity. But this is a digression: for mine own part therefore I will onely blesse her vnimitable renowne, and end with the Poet:
<q>
                  <l>O quam te memorem virgo! Nam<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> haud tibi vultus</l>
                  <l>Mortalis! nec vox hominum sonat ô Deo certè.</l>
               </q>
And so to our Irish businesse againe.</p>
            <p>They which write of the nature of things, say plainely (which also experience confirmes) that as there is a sympathy and sweet agreement in many creatures, as beasts, plants, and diuers of that sort: each thriuing the better by the others proximity and conuersation: So there is a kinde of antipathy and eternall loathsomnesse betweene creature and creature, and many times such an abhorrency, that the very sight and intermixture of things breedeth death, or other mischeefe: Thus is it apparant in diuers plants growing neere the Eugh tree, which either perish immediately, or wither by degrees, without any prosperity: they which are skilfull in musique say, that the strings of wolues &amp; sheep make a discord, and will neuer effect either <hi>Diapason</hi> or harmony. It is recorded, that when <hi>Eteocles</hi> and <hi>Pollinices</hi> the sonnes of <hi>Oedipus</hi> were bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, after they had slaine one another, according to the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of sacrifices in those dayes, the very flame diuided it selfe, shewing that the hate lasted in death, which could not be reconciled in life, and if in any thing it euer appeared, it was and is most probable in the nature and condition of the <hi>Irish,</hi> and our selues. For though they haue beene many times reduced by conformable perswasion, and as many times corrected by powerfull castigation: yet nothing could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine them within the circle of obedience, or fasten them to the dore-post of loue and duty: nor was this the errour and enmity of the North, or (as you terme it) the wilde <hi>Irish</hi> only, but the inficious disposition of the whole Nation, against whom <hi>Tirone</hi> himselfe, in the behalfe of our countrey, hath gone in person, as in the excursions of <hi>Munster, Lease, Ophaly,

Meths</hi> and <hi>Conach</hi> may appeare: yea, at this instant, for all the backe of rebellion seemed broken, and that this great prop of supportation, <hi>Tirone,</hi> was taken from them, whereby they were past all hope of coadiutement, either from him or <hi>Spaine:</hi> yet did the poison of their malice and despight burst out into boiles and botches of deformity, by rebellion against the King himselfe, to welcome him the better, euen the first yeere of his establishment in an vncontroulable Maiesty: all which did questionlesse arise from an inueterate hate, and innated antipathy against vs.</p>
            <p>Againe: whereas no venomous beast will liue, nor is bred in <hi>Ireland,</hi> insomuch that <hi>Beda</hi> reporteth, that in those dayes, when the Ile of <hi>Man</hi> bred a controuersie, to which Kingdome it did appertaine, whether <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> the deciding of the same consisted in this, to carry certain snakes and toades into the Countrey, which if they agreed in the same, and did liue, would easily approoue it <hi>English:</hi> but if they died and miscarried, then questionlesse, by naturall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, <hi>Ireland</hi> had the propriety: wherein the Diuine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence was much glorified, that would not altogether ouer-poyson a nation with noysome creatures and beasts, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the people were bad enough of themselues, and had their very blouds corrupted with the venome of malice, enuy, disdaine, pride and reuenge, euen against one another; and against vs (if it were possible) the very stones and houses see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to swell with mislike, and grow bigg againe with the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors of ambitious rebellion, which more apparantly appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the treasons of diuers towns, by name <hi>Waterford, Corcke,</hi> and <hi>Limricke,</hi> who vpon the false alarum of S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Iames Gouths</hi> warrantize from <hi>England,</hi> for the toleration of religion, went as freshly to masse, as if the Pope himselfe had established his superstitious canons in the same: Nor was this done out of zeale or indirect deuotion, according to the simplicity of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, who were willing to maintaine the Catholique cause; but with fury, rage, and military directions, these strong townes entertained a presumption of fortifying themselues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the power of <hi>England.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:21793:27"/>Whereupon my Lord Deputy was compelled to leaue <hi>Tirone</hi> to himselfe, with a kinde of confidence of his loyalty, and politique directions for the superuizing of his actions, and in person went forward to the suppressing these insolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, vnfolding againe to his great greefe and vnquietnes the woond vp colours of defiances which hee had supposed had beene layd aside for euer: so that whole summer was spent in vnheard of hurliburlies: and his returne into <hi>England</hi> procra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinated for a time: nor was the busines so soone determined, or the intricatenesse of this disturbance so easily vntied, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny imagined. For <hi>Waterford</hi> shut the gates, stood vpon their guard, and denied him entrance with his army, vntill exaspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated with the displeasure, he read them such a lesson of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall discipline, that they well vnderstood a patard could blow open their gates, a mine or battery ouerthrow their walls, and such a Commander would not bee dallied withall, when hee determined indeede to whip their treasons with an impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious authority, and so hee proceeded accordingly, pulling this high-looking head of innouation on her knees, depres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the glory of their Maior and gouernment, forfetting their liberties to the State, and establishing S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Richard Monson</hi> in the full authority of the city, who most iudiciously for the time committed the keyes of the gates to the care and valour of Captaine <hi>Meres.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At <hi>Corcke</hi> they began more roughly, demolishing the new Fort which was a building, turning their ordnance against the castle of <hi>Shandon,</hi> which they shot through, when my Lady <hi>Carey</hi> was in it, mustring their townesmen, to the number of two thousand, one or other, with whom they resolued to man their walls and defend their ports, and proceeded with a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage immanity against diuers, euen to the shedding of bloud, that seemed to intercept, or bee angry with their iollity: and for all they had heard how <hi>Waterford</hi> was serued, yet they durst say, that <hi>Corcke</hi> was a stronger towne, better manned, and so well fortified, that they knew my Lord Deputies preparations were not able to surprize them, which hastned his speedinesse, and encreased his anger, so that they found their abused pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:21793:28"/>
quickly ouermastred, and besides those, which were slaine in the encounters, my Lord hanged diuers, and arraigned both the Maior and Recorder vpon high treason, setting vpright againe both <hi>Shandon</hi> and the new Fort, who at either end of the towne ouerlooke the same, and can by this time batter their houses about their eares, if they doe but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine, or whisper against them.</p>
            <p>From hence hee marched to <hi>Limricke,</hi> but they growing wise by other mens harmes, according to that good councell of <hi>Foelix quem faciunt aliena pericula cautum,</hi> welcommed him that would haue welcommed himselfe, and submitted to such directions, as he enforced against them, not without imprisoning certaine Priests and factious Citizens, whom he detained in prison, as he had done in the other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. From hence he determined to visit <hi>Galloway,</hi> but vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of their conformity, hee put it in the accounts of true subiects, and reputed her as a daughter of faire conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and good behauiour: notwithstanding, he came to <hi>Ath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,</hi> and wiping away all aspersions of rebellion, as hee went, he left them with fairer faces, then they accustomed to haue: to looke more cheerefully on his Deputy S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>George Cary</hi> the Treasurer at warres, who enioying both places, did proceede iudiciously in the ciuill administration, as little troubled with any remarkable innouation, the rest of the time of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morance in the Countrey.</p>
            <p>The next yeere our Deputy prepareth for <hi>England,</hi> as made one of his Maiesties Priuy Councell, Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; and within a while created the Earle of <hi>Deuonshire,</hi> with some donation of land, and contribution of pensions, to the eternall honour of such a Maiesty, that would not let vertue shed a teare for sorrow, that she was vnrespected; &amp; comfort of all the monarchy, that were the better animated to generous performances, when they saw the Prince would regard them. Thus is <hi>Tirone</hi> carried into <hi>England,</hi> as the trophee of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer endeauours and victories. But what a terrible reckoning the accounts of his treasons and vndutifull proceedings sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med together, euery man can tell which ouerlooked the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:21793:28"/>
same. For the peoples hate (as hee passed through <hi>Wales</hi> and other places) was so enflamed against him, that the women presumed to throw durt and stones at him, and the spredding tree which couered him, had much adoe to ouershadow and secure him from the malice and threats of such as railed vpon him: yet with some adoe hath he safe conduct to the Court, and our worthy King looking on him with the eyes of a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble commiseration, quickly welcommed him with cheereful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and as quickly, by the fauour of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> returned him; as the <hi>Iewes</hi> to build vp the walls of broken and desolate <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem:</hi> so hee, to reintegrate his estate, repaire his castles and townes, and settle himselfe in his enheritance, as Lieutenant of the Countrey vnder the King, and to gouerne the same after the manner of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this time is S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Arthur Chichester</hi> Lord Deputy, who watched these parts of the North more narrowly, then any other before him. First, because of his long experience and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence amongst them, as being Gouernor of <hi>Knogfergus,</hi> and a laborious searcher of <hi>Logh Con,</hi> with all the territories adia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. Secondly, in regard of the way open to the flourishes of peace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when the Lords of the North saw such a vnity and consent of goodnesse by <hi>Tirones</hi> remission. Thirdly, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his priuate loue in these parts, to which was vnited a kind of feare &amp; obseruation of his vertue, he had so demeaned himselfe before, &amp; continued euer since. Last of all, by reason of straight directions from <hi>England,</hi> to haue the Shires diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with their orderly officers of Lieutenants and Iustices of peace, euen amongst the meere <hi>Irish,</hi> who neuer heard of such names and gouernment before, to send out Iudges of Assise, whose absolute authority was for the time supereminent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all others, and to punish malefactours after our Law and fashion of <hi>England,</hi> euen to the terrour of the greatest, who vilipended the same, or durst oppose against the inhibition to the contrary: which when <hi>Tirone</hi> perceiued must be done in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, hee liued more discontented then euer, and fraighted (as it were) with old stoage of malice and enuy, studied euery houre how to cast off this intolerable yoake of obedience, and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:21793:29"/>
not to suffer (as he termed it) another to sit Paramont in the tribunall of his Iudicatures.</p>
            <p>So that according to our first <hi>simile</hi> of <hi>Cyrus</hi> returning the <hi>Iewes</hi> to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> you shall see how he kept correspondency in the same. The <hi>Iewes</hi> surfeted of ease, forgat their captiuity, &amp; returned to lick vp the filth, that their excesse had vomited; yea, so exasperated the displeasure of their great and good God, that at last hee forsooke them indeede, and stretched the strong armes of <hi>Vespasian</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> to vnplume their iayes feathers, and throw them forsaken ouer the world like dispersed vagabonds.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tirone</hi> returneth home, as you heard, liueth at ease and pleasure, surfetting of the same, entertaineth his Priests, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens to his Bards and Rimers, is seduced to mislike this new gouernment, denieth the Iudges of Assise entrance into his Countrey, contesteth with the Deputy about the same (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he euer acknowledged his worth, and confessed that S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Arthur Chichester</hi> had vnited many vertues to a Souldiers name) secondeth the Earle of <hi>Terconnel</hi> in his repinings, and alloweth of S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Caher Odohordies</hi> contentions, maligning our forwardnesse and successe, when hee saw him lie bleeding on the ground, and verily supposed that the burning of the <hi>Dery,</hi> with the comming forward of <hi>Odonnell</hi> to forage the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, would haue made another <hi>Gordion</hi> to trouble all the Country again to vntie the knot. But, as God would haue it, there is another <hi>Alexander</hi> to fulfill the prophesie, or <hi>Oedipus</hi> to dissolue the riddle, who with a sword in his hand can cut it in peeces, so that these new Rebells are discomfited, and such a blast of displeasure is blowne against <hi>Dungannon,</hi> as the North-east winde, that strucke the foure corners of <hi>Iobs</hi> el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest sonnes house, and quite ouerthrew it, to the destruction of the people within. For when my Lord Deputy saw no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remedy: but that <hi>Tamberlaines</hi> blacke flagg must needes be set vp, (the white and the red quite refused) he hasted with fire and sword into the North, and not onely tertified this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Lord with all his Complices, but compelled them to abandon their castles, houses, and inheritances, taking abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:21793:29"/>
possession for his new Master the King of Great <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi> and incorporated them to the Crowne so firmely and perpetually, that no fine and recouery of their rebellious power should or could disanull the contract, or frustrate the deed: for <hi>England</hi> presently seased on the same, and like a true Lord and powerfull Commander, placed better tenants, and diuided the Countrey into seuerall mens hands; yea, enfeoffed the City of <hi>London</hi> with such a right, that I am perswaded all the <hi>Irish</hi> in the world, or Irish Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adiutors will neuer be able to wrest it out of their hands.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tirone</hi> being thus made the spectacle of misery, by the incitement of certaine Priests, flieth into <hi>Terconnell,</hi> and contriueth with that Earle to forsake their Countrey, and repaire to <hi>Rome,</hi> where they might be sure to be shrowded vnder the Angells wings of the Castle S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Angelo,</hi> and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with the holy fathers entertainment, from the affronts of all disturbance, which accordingly with all conuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy they could, they put in practise, gathering together what treasure the Countrey affoorded, and so with his wife and children, <hi>Terconnells</hi> wife and young sonne, and some fifty persons or attendants they shipped themselues, and found sufficient friends and meanes to escape.</p>
            <p>Thus like exiles forsaken, dispersed and abandoned, full of horrours of a guilty conscience, vexed in soule by strange excruciations, tormented with feare of being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed at home, abashed at the shame of being entertained abroad, and affrighted with the disaster of their lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deiection: they are at length compulsed to hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues amongst the rotten reedes of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> euen the Pope and his Consistory of Cardinalls, as in their former deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination: where, how his afflictions encreased, and with what vexation of spirit hee eateth the repining bran of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens corne, that might haue fed on the fine flowre of his owne threshing; I beleeue most trauellers know, but am assured some tremble to behold the alteration: so that for my selfe, well acquainted with all his entertainments

abroad, and misfortunes at home, as knowing him in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and meeting him in <hi>Italy</hi>: I may lawfully conclude:
