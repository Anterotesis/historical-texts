            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>Conditions repugnant, the eſtate good, the Condition void.</p>
                     <p>Conditions impoſſible, are void, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate good; it ſhall not enlarge any eſtate.</p>
                     <p>By pleading, a man may not defeat an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of Frank-Tenement, by force of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in Deed; without he ſhew the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Record, or in writing ſealed; yet the Jurie may help a man, where the Judges will take their Verdict at large: of Chatttels he may.</p>
                     <p>Promiſe doth make a Condition; but when it doth depend upon another ſentence, or hath reference to another part of the deed, it maketh no condition, but a qualification,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:47054:45"/>
or limitation of the ſentence, or of that part of the Deed, as provided, that the perſon of the Grantee ſhall not be charged.</p>
                     <p>He which hath intereſt in a Condition, may fulfill the ſame for ſafeguard of himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Between the parties, it is not requiſite the Condition be performed in every thing if the other do agree, but to a ſtranger it muſt.</p>
                     <p>If the Obligee be partie to any Act. by which the Condition cannot be performed; then the Obligor ſhall be diſcharged; So he ſhall be by the Act of the Condition.</p>
                     <p>Where the firſt Act in the Condition is to be performed by the Obligee, and he will not do it, there the Obligation is not forfeited.</p>
                     <p>Where no time is ſet, if the Condition be for the good of a ſtranger, or of the Obligee, then it is to be performed within convenient time, if for the good of the Obligor at any time during their lives; Immediately, ſhall not have ſuch a ſtrict conſtruction; but that it ſhall ſuffice, if it be done in convenient time.</p>
                     <p>If a man be bound to pay money, or farm Rent, he muſt ſeek the parties. But if he be bound to perform all payments: if he render his farm on the land, it ſufficeth.</p>
                     <p>If the Feoffee, or Feoffor die before the day of payment, the tender ſhall be to the

                     <p>The money muſt be tendred ſo long before Sun-ſet, that the receiver may ſee to tell it.</p>
                     <p>To pay part of a Sum at the day, cannot be ſatisfaction for the whole ſum, as a horſe or a robe is. But before the day, or at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, at the day of the requeſt, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of the Obligee, is full ſatisfaction.</p>
                     <p>An Acquittance is a good barr, if nothing be paid.</p>
                     <p>In all caſes of Conditions, a payment of a certain ſum in groſs, touching Lands, or Tenements, if lawfull tender be once refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, he which made the tender is diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forever.</p>

                     <p>COvenants are of two ſorts; expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by words in the Deed, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed by the Law. A covenant in Deed, is an agreement made by the Deed in writing, between two perſons to performe ſome things, and ſealed: for no writ of Covenant is maintainable without ſuch a ſpecialty, but in <hi>London,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>When a Covenant doth extend to a thing in being parcell of the demiſe, or thing to be done by force of the Covenant is <hi>quodamodo,</hi> annexed, or appertaining to the thing demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and goeth with the land, it ſhall bind the aſſignee, if he be not named: as to repair the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:47054:48"/>
houſes, it ſhall bind all that ſhall come to the ſame by the act of the law, or by the act of the party.</p>
                     <p>But if the Covenant do concern the land, or thing demiſed in ſome ſort, the Aſſignee ſhall not be charged, although he be named; as to make a Wall at anothers bodies houſe, or to pay a ſum of money to the Leſſor, or to a ſtranger, But the Leſſee his executors and Adminiſtrators ſhall be charged.</p>
                     <p>If the Covenant do extend to a thing that had no being, but to be made new upon the Land, it ſhould binde the Aſſignee, if he be named, becauſe he ſhall have the benefit of it.</p>
                     <p>If a man make a Leaſe for years, and the Leſſee covenanteth and granteth to pay, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the Leſſor his heirs and aſſignes, yearly during, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ten pound, his Executors ſhall have it.</p>
                     <p>A Covenant in Law, upon a demiſe, or grant, the Aſſignee in Deed, or in law may have a Writ of Covenant.</p>
                     <p>An Obligation to perform all Covenants and grants is forfeit on the breach of a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in law.</p>
                     <p>A Covenant in Law is not broken but by an elder title.</p>
                     <p>A Covenant in Law may be qualified by the mutual conſent of the parties.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>How Chattels perſonal may be bargained, ſold, exchanged, lent, and reſtored.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>AContract is properly where a man for his mony ſhall have by the aſſent of another, certain goods, or ſome other profit at the time of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, or after.</p>
                     <p>In all Bargaines, Sales, Contracts, Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and Agreements, there muſt be <hi>quid pro quo,</hi> preſently, except day be given expreſly for the payment, or elſe it is nothing but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication.</p>
                     <p>If a man do agree for a price of wares, he may not carry them away before he hath paid for them, if he have not day expreſly given him to pay for them.</p>
                     <p>But the Merchant ſhall retain the wares until he be paid for them, and if the other take them, the Merchant may have an action of treſpaſs, or an action of debt for the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney at his choice.</p>
                     <p>If the bargain be that you ſhall give me ten pound for my Horſe, and you do give me a penny in earneſt, which I do accept: This is a perfect bargain, you ſhall have the Horſe by an action of the Caſe, and I ſhall have the money by an action of debt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="88" facs="tcp:47054:49"/>If I ſay the price of a Cow is four pounds, and you ſay you will give me four pounds, and doe not pay me preſently, you may not have her afterwards, except I will; for it is no contract. But if you goe preſently to telling of your money, if I ſell her to another, you ſhal have your action of the Caſe againſt me.</p>
                     <p>If I buy one hundred loads of Wood to be taken in ſuch a Wood at the appointment of the vendor, if he upon requeſt will not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne them unto me. I may take them, or I may ſell them: But if a ſtranger doe cut down any part of the trees, I may not take them; But I may ſupply my Grantee of the reſidue, or have my action of the Caſe.</p>
                     <p>If the bargain be, that I ſhall give you ten pounds for ſuch a Wood, if I like it upon the view thereof, this is a bargaine at my plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure vpon my view; and if the day be agreed upon, if I diſagree before the day, if I agree at the day the bargain is perfect, although afterwards I do diſagree. But I may not cut the Wood before I have paid for it; if I do, an action of Treſpaſſe will lie againſt me, and if you ſell it to another, an action of Treſpaſs on the Caſe will lie againſt you.</p>
                     <p>If I ſell my horſe for money, I may keep him untill I am paid, but I cannot have an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of debt untill he be delivered, yet the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:47054:49"/>
property of the horſe is by the bargain in the bargainer, or buyer; but if he do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently tender me my money, and I do refuſe it, he may take the horſe, or have an action of detainment. And if the horſe die in my ſtable between the bargain and the delivery, I may have an action of debt for my money, becauſe by the bargain the property was in the buyer.</p>
                     <p>If a Deed be made of Goods and chattels, and delivered to the uſe of the Donee, the property of the Goods and Chattels are in the Donee preſently: before any entry, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, the Donee may refuſe them if he will.</p>
                     <p>If I take a horſe of another mans, and ſell him; and the owner take him again: I may have an action of Debt for the money, for the bargain was perfect by the delivery of the horſe, <hi>&amp; caveat Emptor.</hi> Every Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract importeth in it ſelf an aſſumption: for when one doth agree to pay money, or deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a thing upon conſideration, he doth as it were, aſſume and promiſe to pay and deliver the ſame, and therefore when one ſelleth any goods to another, and agreeth to deliver them at a day to come: and the other in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, agreeth to pay ſo much money on the delivery, or after, in this Caſe, he may
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:47054:50"/>
have an action of Debt, or an action on the Caſe upon the aſſumption.</p>
                     <p>The duty to reſign an Action perſonal, may not be apportioned; as if I ſell my Horſe, and another mans for ten pounds, who taketh his Horſe againe, I ſhall have all the money.</p>
                     <p>If a man retained a ſervant for 10.<hi>l. per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> and he depart within the year, he can have no wages: if it were to be paid at two Feaſts, and the man after the firſt Feaſt die, he ſhall have wages but for the firſt Feaſt; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men take order for it in their Wils.</p>
                     <p>By a Contract made in a Faire or Market, the property is altered; Except it be to the King; ſo that the buyer know not of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer property, and doe pay tole, and enter it; and thoſe things as thereupon ought to be done, it muſt be on the Market, and at the place where ſuch things are uſually ſold, as Place at the Goldſmiths ſtall, and not in his Inner ſhop.</p>
                     <p>In exchange of a Horſe for a Horſe, or ſuch like, the bargaine is good without giving of day, or delivery.</p>
                     <p>If a thing be promiſed by way of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for a thing that is paſt; it is rather an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord than a contract; &amp; upon an accord, there lieth no account, but he unto whom the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is made, may have charge, by reaſon of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:47054:50"/>
the promiſe, which he hath alſo performed; then he ſhall have an account for the thing promiſed, though he that made the promiſe have no profit thereby; as if a man ſay to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man, heal ſuch a poor man, or make ſuch a high-way, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The intent of the party ſhall be taken ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law, as if a man retain a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and do not ſay one year, or how long he ſhall ſerve him, it ſhall be taken for one a yeer, according to the Statute.</p>
                     <p>In all contracts he that ſpeaketh obſcurely, or ambiguouſly is ſaid to ſpeak at his own pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril, and ſuch ſpeeches are to be taken ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt himſelf.</p>

                     <p>A Deviſe ought to be good and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al at the time of the death of the Deviſor.</p>
                     <p>The Deviſee may not enter into the terme, or take a Chattell, but by the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the Executor.</p>

                     <p>Into Frank-tenement, or inheritance he may enter.</p>
                     <p>Deviſees are Purchaſees, as if a Leaſe for years be Willed to a man and his Heires, the Heire ſhall have it; for Heire is a name of purchaſe here.</p>

                     <p>If a man deviſe all his Lands and Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; a Leaſe for years doth not paſs, where he hath Lands in Fee, and alſo a Leaſe there; otherwiſe it will.</p>

                     <p>There is great diverſity where the property is deviſed, and when the occupation is devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: A man may deviſe that a man ſhall have the occupation of his Plate, or other chattells during his life, or for years, and if he die within the term, that it ſhall remain to <hi>M.

But it doth appear that his intent was ſo by the words.</p>
                     <p>If a man willeth his Lands to his wife, til his Son commeth to the age of 21 yeers, and the woman taketh another husband, and dyeth, the husband ſhall have the Intereſt.</p>
                     <p>By a Deviſe a man may have the Fee-ſimple without expreſs words of Heirs, as if Lands be willed to a man for ever, or to have and to hold to him and to his aſſignes, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>By Will, Lands may be intailed without the word, Body: as if Lands be given to a man, and to his heirs male, it doth make an eſtate tail.</p>
                     <p>If a man Will that his Executors ſhall ſell his Lands, the inheritance doth deſcend to

                     <p>An Executor may ſell, if the other will not.</p>
                     <p>If Lands be recover'd againſt Tenant for life or for years, by an action of Waſte, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer title, he may not give his Corn.</p>

notwithſtanding he that refuſeth may adminiſter at his pleaſure, and the other muſt name him in every action, for every duty due to the Teſtator, and his releaſe ſhall be a good barr: If he do ſurvive he may adminiſter, and not the Executor of him that died; but otherwiſe if all had refuſed.</p>
                     <p>If one prove the Will in the name of both, he that doth not adminiſter ſhall not be charged.</p>
                     <p>If the Executor do once any action that is proper to an Executor, as to receive the Teſtators debts, or to give acquittance for the ſame, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he may not refuſe.</p>
                     <p>But other acts of charity or humanity, he may do; as to diſpoſe of the Teſtators goods about the Funerall, to feed his cattell leaſt they periſh, or to keep his goods leaſt they be ſtoln, theſe things may every one do, without danger.</p>
                     <p>When Executors do bring an action, it ſhal be in all their names, aſwell of them that do refuſe, as of other,</p>

                     <p>An Executor is chargeable for all duties of the Teſtator that are certain; but not for Treſpaſs, nor for receipt of rents, nor for oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation of Lands, as Bailiffe or Guardian in Soccage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For this is not any duty cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſo farr as he ſhall have Aſſets; If the Executor do waſte the goods of the Teſtator, he ſhall pay them of his own.</p>
                     <p>An Executor ſhall not be charged, but
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:47054:57"/>
with ſuch goods as come to his hands, but if a ſtranger take them out of his poſſeſſion, they are aſſets in his hands.</p>

                     <p>IT is further to be obſerved, that all Eſtates that have their being, are in Poſſeſſion, Reverſion, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder, or in Right, but of all theſe, Poſſeſſion is the Principall: there are two degrees of the firſt, and chiefeſt poſſeſſion, <hi>in fait poſs,</hi> in Law or Deed, is ſuch as is before ſpoken of: And that is moſt proper to an Eſtate, which is preſent and immediate; but yet ſuch poſſeſſion of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Eſtate, if it be not greater then a tearm doth operate and enure to make the like poſſeſſion of the Free-hold, or Reverſion; when a man is ſaid to have a Tearm, it is to be intended for years, when it is ſaid, a man to have the Fee of Lands, it is alſo to be intended a Fee ſimple; Poſſeſſion is that poſſeſſion, which the Law it ſelf caſteth upon
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:47054:64"/>
a man before any Entry, or Pernancy of the profits: As if there be Father and Son, and the Father dieth ſeiſed of Lands in Fee, and the ſame do deſcend to the Sonne, as his next Heire in this caſe, before any entry, the ſame hath a poſſeſſion in Law; ſo it is alſo of a Reverſion exportant, or a Remainder dependant upon particular Eſtate, or life; in which caſe, if Tenant for life die, he in Reverſion, or Remainder, before his Entry, hath only poſſeſſion in Law. All manner of poſſeſſions that are not poſſeſſions in <hi>fait,</hi> are only poſſeſſions in Law; and it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved then, if a man have a greater Eſtate in Lands then for years, the proper phraſe of ſpeech is, that he is thereof ſeiſed; but if it be for years only, then he is thereof poſſeſſed: But yet nevertheleſs the Subſtantive (poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) is proper as well to the one as to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

                     <head>Reverſion.</head>
                     <p>A Reverſion is properly an Eſtate which the Law reſerveth to the Donor, Grantor, or Leſſor, or ſuch like, which he doth diſpoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of his Eſtate, when he doth diſpoſe leſs E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate in Law then that whereof he was ſeiſed, at the time of ſuch diſpoſition: as if a man
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:47054:64"/>
ſeiſed of Lands in Fee, doth give the ſame to another; and the Heires of his body, or if he doth diſmiſs the ſame for life or years; in theſe caſes the ſame reſerveth the reverſion thereof in Fee, to the Donor, or Leſſor, and his Heires; becauſe he departed not with his whole Eſtate, but onely with a particular E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, which is leſs then his Eſtate in Fee; and ſuch Reverſion is ſaid to be expectance upon the particular Eſtate. Alſo if he that is but Tenant for life, for Land, and doth by Deed or paroll, give the ſame <hi>S.</hi> in Tayle, or for tearm of his life, which is a greater Eſtate then he may lawfully diſpoſe; In this caſe the Law reſerveth a Reverſion in Fee, in ſuch Donor, though he were formerly but Tenant for life: and the reaſon thereof is, for that by ſuch unlawfull diſpoſition, which by deed or word, cannot be without livery and ſeiſin, he doth by wrong pluck out the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſtate in Fee, from him that was thereof formerly ſeiſed in Reverſion or Remainder, and thereof by a priority of time, gained in an inſtance, he was ſeiſed of a Fee ſimple, at the time of the executon thereof. But if a man ſeiſed of Lands in Fee ſimple, giveth the ſame to <hi>A.</hi> and his heirs, until <hi>B.</hi> do die with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out heire of his body; in this caſe the Law reſerveth no Reverſion in the Donor, becauſe
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:47054:65"/>
the ſtate is diſpoſed to <hi>A.</hi> is a Fee ſimple, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable, is in nature ſo great as the ſtate, which the Donor had at the time of ſuch gift, and conſequently he departed thereby with al his ſtate, and therby an apparent difference is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a gift made to <hi>A.</hi> and the heires of his own body, and a gift made to him and his heires, until <hi>B.</hi> die without heire of his body: for in the one caſe the Donor hath but an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate Tayle, and in the other a Fee ſimple de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminable, hath a poſſibility of Revertor: for if <hi>B.</hi> die without heire of his body, then whether <hi>A.</hi> be living or dead, ſhall revert to the Donor, but ſuch poſſibility of Reverſion, for he that hath but ſuch a poſſibility, hath no Eſtate, nor hath he power to give his poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility; but in the other caſe, the Donor hath Eſtate in Fee; and therefore he hath power to diſpoſe thereof at his pleaſure.</p>

                     <p>Fifthly, That the perſon or body to whom the Remainder is limitted, be either capable at the time of limitation thereof, or elſe in <hi>potentia propinqua,</hi> to be thereof capable, during the particular Eſtate; If Lands be given to <hi>I. S.</hi> and his Heirs, the Remainder for default of ſuch Heir to <hi>I. D.</hi> and his Heirs, that Remainder is void, becauſe it doth not depend upon any particular Eſtate; But if

Lands be given to <hi>I. D.</hi> the life of <hi>I. D.</hi> the Remainder to <hi>I.

B.</hi> deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable: if Lands be given to <hi>B.</hi> for 11. years, if <hi>C.</hi> do ſo long live, the Remainder, after the death of <hi>C.</hi> to <hi>D.</hi> in Fee, this Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is void, for in this caſe it cannot paſs out of the Leſſor at the time of the creation of the particular Eſtate for years: but if a Leaſe be made to <hi>B.</hi> for life, the Remainder to the Heires of <hi>C.</hi> (who is then living) this Remainder is good, upon a contingency, that if <hi>C.</hi> dye in the life of <hi>B.</hi> for that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder may well paſs out of the Leaſſor preſently without <hi>be yaunce,</hi> without any inconveniency, becauſe onely the inheritance ſeparated from the Free-hold, is in abeyance: if Lands be given for life, with a Remainder to the right Heirs of <hi>I. S.</hi> and the Tenant for life dyeth in the life of <hi>I. S.</hi> this Remainder is void, becauſe it died not veſt or ſettled, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther during the particular Eſtate, or at the time of the determination thereof, for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til, <hi>I. S.</hi> die, no perſon is thereof capable, by the name of the Heir.</p>
                     <p>But if Lands be given to <hi>I. S.</hi> for terme of his life, the Remainder to his right Heir,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:47054:66"/>
(in the ſingular number) and the Heirs of his body, and after <hi>I. S.</hi> hath iſſue a Son and dyeth, that is a good Remainder, and the Son hath thereby an Eſtate Tail, for although it were unpoſſible that ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder ſhould veſt during the particular E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate; becauſe during his life, none could be his Heir; yet it might be and did veſt at the inſtant of his death, which was at the time of his determination of the particular E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the fourth thing, if a man ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of Lands in Fee, granteth out of the ſame a Rent, or Common to Paſture, or ſuch like things, which before the grant had no being, to <hi>I. S.</hi> for terme of life, the Remainder to <hi>I. D.,</hi> in Fee, this Remainder is void, becauſe of this thing Granted, there was no Remnant in the grant to diſpoſe. And becauſe ſome heretofore have been of opinion, that albeit the ſame cannot take no effect, as another Grant of a new Rent or Common. <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tres magis valeat quam operat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is a rule in Law, that a thing enjoyed in a ſuperior degree, ſhall not paſs under the name of a thing, in any inferior degree; and therefore if Lands be given unto two perſons, and unto the Heirs of one of them, unto the Husband and Wife, and Heir of the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band;
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:47054:67"/>
and he that hath the Eſtate of Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, granteth the Verſion of the ſame Land to another in Fee, ſuch Grant is void, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Grantor was thereof ſeiſed in a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour degree, <hi>viz.</hi> in Poſſeſſion, and not in Reverſion, as appeareth 22. <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. <hi>fol.</hi> 2 <hi>&amp;</hi> 13. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>Brook.</hi> title of Grants, 137.</p>
                     <p>And concerning the firſt and laſt thing, if a Leaſe be made of Land, for term of life, the Remainder to the Major and Commonalty of <hi>D.</hi> whereas there is no ſuch Corporation therein, being this Remainder is meerly void, albeit the Kings Majeſty by his Letters Pattents, do create ſuch Corporations, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the particular Eſtate; for at the time of ſuch grant, the Remainder was void, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then there was no ſuch body corporate thereof capable, or <hi>potentia propinqua</hi> to be created and made capable thereof, during the particular Eſtate, but the poſſibility thereof, was then forraign and probably intended. The like law is, if a remainder be limited to <hi>I.</hi> the Son of <hi>T. S.</hi> who had then no Son, and afterwards during the particular Eſtate, a Son is born who is named <hi>John,</hi> yet this Remainder is void; for at the time of ſuch a Grant, as was not to be probably in tender, that <hi>T. S.</hi> ſhould have any Son of that name.</p>

                        <pb n="125" facs="tcp:47054:67"/>Alſo before the diſſolution of Abbies; if a Leaſe of Land were made to <hi>I.

But if ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder had been limited to the firſt begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Son of <hi>I.

                        <hi>Littleton</hi> in his Chap. of Fee-ſimple ſaith, that theſe words (his Heirs) onely make the eſtate of inheritance in all Feoffaments,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:47054:74"/>
and Grants, &amp;c. Sure then it is neceſſary for him that purchaſeth Lands, &amp;c. in Fee ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to have the Feoffament run to himſelf <hi>&amp; haeredibus ſuis,</hi> for if it run onely to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>&amp; aſſignatis ſuis,</hi> although livery and ſeiſin be made accordingly, and agreeable to the deed; yet thereby onely an eſtate for life ſhall paſs, becauſe there wanteth words of Inheritance: and without livery and ſeiſin in the caſe aforeſaid, onely an Eſtate at Will ſhall paſs. And the reaſon why the Law is ſo ſtrict in this thing (as in many others) for to preſcribe and appoint ſuch certain words to create and make an eſtate of inheritance, is, as Maſter <hi>Plowden</hi> ſaith in his Commentaries, for the eſchewing and avoiding of incertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the very Fountain and ſpring, from whence floweth all manner of confuſion and diſorder, which the Law utterly contemneth and abhorreth; what herein hath been ſaid, is to be apprehended and underſtood of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in, and according to their natural capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities. Yet perhaps an eſtate of inheritance may ſometime paſs in a Deed of Feoffament, by words, which may have reference, and will relate to a certainty, for <hi>Certum-eſt quod certum reddi poteſt:</hi> as for example, You En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feoffe me and my Heirs of a certain piece of Land, to hold to me, &amp; my Heirs, &amp;c. and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enfeoffe

you, in as large, ample, and benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all manner, as you enfeoffed me: in this caſe (they ſay) you have a Fee ſimple for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon above expreſſed. So I come next to ſee what obſervations the Deed of Feoffament further affordeth.</p>

                     <p>Very neceſſary and convenient it is in deeds of Feoffament, &amp;c. to have the Lands, &amp;c. thereby intended to be conveyed, certainely and expreſſely to be ſet downe, aſwell how much by eſtimation in quantity, they doe containe, as the quality of the ſame whether Meadow, Paſture, &amp;c. being the ſpecies of Land, which is the <hi>genus,</hi> and the place where, and manner how they exiſt and lye, the better to ſhunne and avoid doubt, and ambiguity, which oftentimes ſtirre up occaſions of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind ſuites and contentions betwixt party and party, I know that Grammarians rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the word <hi>peciam,</hi> will be ready to ſmile, and alledge, that it cannot defend it ſelfe <hi>in bello Grammaticali,</hi> which I eaſily confeſſe; but what then what can they inferre from hence? will they therefore utterly condemne the uſe thereof? me thinkes they ſhould not, but might give Lawyers leave to ſpeakin their owne <hi>Dialect.</hi> But what, if ſome take excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at this word, having occaſion to meete

And indeed I ſee no reaſon why any man ſhould object or cavil againſt the uſage of ſuch words, though they be not claſſical, ſeeing that aſwel in the Art of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, as in Philoſophy, there are found ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny words, which they call <hi>Vocabulaartis,</hi> vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cables of Art, which can no better ſtand, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſtrict rules of Grammar, then the ancient words of Law which cannot be changed without much inconvenience.</p>

The firſt is when one by Deed bindeth both him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his heires to Warranty, and after death, this warranty diſcendeth to and upon his Heire. The ſecond is in a tranſverſe, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthwart line, ſo that the party upon whom the warranty deſcendeth, cannot convey the title which he hath in the Land, from him that was the maker of the Warranty. The third and laſt is, where a man unlawfully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth upon the Freehold of another, thereof diſſeiſing him, and conveyeth it with a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty, but this laſt cannot barr at all. Of theſe, you may read plentifull and excellent matter and examples in <hi>Littletons</hi> Chapter of Warranty, and Sir <hi>Ed.

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:47054:80"/>
things very worthy obſervation concerning it. Before I come to the fifth part of the Deed of Feoffament, give me leave to obſerve that a Warranty alwayes deſcendeth to the Heire at the Common Law, and followeth the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate (as the ſhadow the ſubſtance) and whenſoever the Eſtate may, the Warranty may alſo be defeated, and every Warranty (as ſaith Sir <hi>Ed. Coke</hi>) which deſcends, doth deſcend to him that is Heire to him which made the Warranty, by the Common-Law.</p>
                     <p>And moreover it is to be noted, as may be gathered from what hath been formerly ſaid, that an Heire ſhal not be bound to an expreſs Warranty, but when the Anceſtor was bound by the ſame Warranty, for if the Anceſtor were never bound, the Heire ſhall never be charged. And I remember I have read a caſe in <hi>Br. abr.</hi> 35. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>pl.</hi> 266. to this purpoſe. <hi>Si home dit en ſon garrantie, Et ego tenementa praedicta cum pertinentiis praefato A.

                     <p>THis clauſe is added as a preparatory di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to the ſealing of the Deed, for ſealing is eſſentially required to the perfection thereof, becauſe it doth plainly ſhew the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offors conſent to, and approbation of what therein is contained, hereupon it will not be much devious or out of the way, to make ſome mention of thoſe faſhions, which in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſealing, and ſubſcribing of deeds, have been anciently uſed by our Anceſtors: Some report that the <hi>Saxons</hi> in their time, before the Conqueſt, uſed to ſubſcribe their names to their Deeds, adding the ſigne of the croſſe, and ſetting down in the end, the names of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain witneſſes, without any kinde of ſealing at all. But when the <hi>Normans</hi> came in, as men loving their owne Country guiſes, they <hi>per petit &amp; petit</hi> changed that cuſtome (as alſo many others) which they found here, and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulphus</hi> who was made Abbot of <hi>Croyland,</hi> in <hi>an. dom.</hi> 1075. ſeemeth to confirme this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in theſe words: <hi>Normanni cheirographo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum confectionem cum crucibus aureis, &amp;
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:47054:81"/>
aliis ſignaculis ſacris in Anglia firmari ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam, in cera impreſſa mutant.</hi> Yet I have read of a ſealed Charter in <hi>England</hi> before the Conqueſt, namely that of St. <hi>Ed.</hi> made to the Abby of Weſtminſter: yet ſurely this doth not altogether repugne that which hath been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſaid, for I have ſeen in Maſter <hi>Fabians</hi> Chronicle, and elſewhere that Saint <hi>Ed.</hi> was educated in Normandy, and tis not unlikely but he might in ſome things incline to their faſhions. The French-men have a proverbe, <hi>Rome n'a eſte baſtie tout en un jour;</hi> and we in England uſe the ſame, namely Rome was not built in one day: So it cannot be conceived that the Normans in an Inſtnat did alter the Saxon cuſtome wholly in this particular, but that it did change by degrees, and perhaps at the firſt, the King and ſome nigh unto, and about him did uſe the impreſſion of a Seale, which I am ſomewhat perſwaded to beleeve, from a certain ſtory which I have heard, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Richard de Lucy,</hi> chief Juſtice of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, who in the time of <hi>H.</hi> 2. is ſaid to have chidden an ordinary man, becauſe he had ſealed a Deed with a private Seal <hi>Quant ceo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine al Roy &amp; Nobility ſolement.</hi> In the dayes of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, ſealing and Seales were very uſuall amongſt all men, for proofe whereof I need not produce any other teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,

Coke,</hi> in the firſt part of his Inſtitutes, <hi>fo. 7. a.</hi> ſeemeth to overthrow the former opinions about the firſt uſing of Seales in England, The ſealing of Charters and Deeds, (ſaith he) is much more ancient then ſome have imagined, for the Charter of King <hi>Edwin</hi> brother of King <hi>Edgar,</hi> bearing date <hi>an. dom.</hi> 956. made of the Land called <hi>Jecklea,</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Ely,</hi> was not onely ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with his owne ſeale (which appeareth by theſe words) <hi>Ego Edwinus gratia Dei totius Britannicae telluris Rex meum donum proprio figillo confirmavi,</hi> but alſo the Biſhop of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter put to his ſeal, <hi>Ego Aelfwinus Winton' Eccleſiae divinus ſpeculator proprium ſigillum impreſſi.</hi> And the Charter of King <hi>Offa,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he gave the <hi>Peter-pence,</hi> doth yet remain under Seal.

                  <div type="part">
                     <head>Livery of Seiſin.</head>
                     <p>LIvery of Seiſin is a ceremony in Law, uſed in the conveyance of an Eſtate of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold at the leaſt in Lands and other things corporeal: but in a Leaſe for years, at Will, &amp;c. Livery of Seiſin is not required, it being onely a Chattel and no Free-hold. By Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of Seiſin, the Feoffor doth declare his willingneſs to part with that whereof he makes the Livery, and the Feoffees accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance thereof is thereby made known and manifeſt. The Author of the new Termes of the Law, ſaith that it was invented as an open and notorious thing, by means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Common people might have know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the paſſing or alteration of Eſtates from man to man, that thereby they might be the better able to try in whom the right and poſſeſſion of Land's and Tenements were
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:47054:83"/>
if they ſhould be impanelled on Juries, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe have to do concerning the ſame. The uſual and common manner in theſe daies of delivering of Seiſin, I know to be ſo frequent, that of purpoſe I will omit it: But I pray you note with me before I make an end, that Livery of Seſin is of 2 ſorts, <hi>viz.</hi> Livery of Seiſin in Deed, and Livery of Seiſin in Law, which is ſometimes termed livery of Seiſin within the veiw. Livery of Seiſin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the veiw cannot be good or effectual, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Feoffee doth enter into the Lands, &amp;c. whereof the Livery of Seiſin was made unto him in the life time of the Feoffor; &amp; it is not to be paſſed over in ſilence, that a Livery in Law may ſometimes be perfected by an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in Law, as if a man maketh a deed of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offament, and delivers Seiſin within the view, the Feoffee dares not enter for fear of death, but claimes the ſame, this ſhall veſt the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and inheritance in him, to which effect you may ſee the opinion of certain Juſtices, 38. <hi>Aſſiſ. Pl.</hi> 23. upon a verdict of Aſſiſe in the County of <hi>Dorc.</hi> And I conceive that this veſting of a new Eſtate, in the ſaid caſe in the Feoffee, making his claim were he dares not enter, ſtands upon the ſame reaſon, for (<hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariorum eadem eſt ratio</hi>) that the reveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an ancient Eſtate and Right in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiſee
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:47054:83"/>
doth by ſuch claim, whereof you may read plentifully in <hi>Littleton</hi> his Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Continual Claim.</hi> It is worth the obſervation that no man can conſtitute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother to receive Livery for him, within the view, nor yet to deliver (as I have heard my Maſter ſay) for none can take by force or vertue of a Livery in Law, but he that taketh the Free-hold himſelf, <hi>&amp; è contra.</hi> Otherwiſe it is to take and give Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of Seiſin in Deed, for there aſwel the Feoffee in the one caſe may ordain and make his Attorney, or Attorneys in his name and ſtead, to take Livery, as the Feoffor in the other caſe to give Livery, <hi>Concurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus iis quae in jure requiruntur.</hi> And now let Delivery of the Deed to be added to the ſealing thereof, and the ſtate executing of the Lands thereby conveyed, and then I preſume none will refuſe to allow that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing hath been named, which is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially required to the perfection of a bare Deed of Feoffament, and although I have mentioned the delivery of the Deed in the laſt place, yet it is not the leaſt thing, or of the leaſt conſequence or moment, for after a Deed is ſealed, if it be not delivered, <hi>eſt a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nul purpoſe,</hi> it is to no purpoſe, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:47054:84"/>
muſt be by the party himſelf, or his ſufficient warrant: So it may be gathered from what hath been ſaid, that ſealing of Deeds without Delivery is nothing, and that Delivery without Sealing will make no Deed, but that both Sealing and Delivery muſt concur and meet together, to make perfect Deeds.</p>
                     <p>I hope ſuch as are preſent at the Sealing and Delivering of Deeds of Feoffament, and the State executing thereupon, will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get to ſubſcribe their names, or markes, as witneſſes thereof, whereby they may the better be inabled to remember what therein hath been done, if peradventure there ſhall be occaſion to make uſe of them.
