            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And we may further observe concerning these two Apostles, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> usually toucheth upon this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">§. 2.

                  </gap>aphrased;</note> those new converts might have objected. Wee have been taught, that the Son of God hath made us free, and then we are <note n="a" place="margin">Iohn 8. 36.</note> 
               <hi>free indeed:</hi> and so not bound to subject our selves to any Masters or Governours upon earth, no not to Kings; but much rather bound not to doe it, that so we may <hi>preserve</hi> that freedome which Christ hath purchased for us, and <hi>reserve</hi> our selves the more entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for <hi>Gods service</hi> by refusing to be <hi>the servants of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This objection the Apostle clearely taketh off in the text, with much holy wisdome, and truth. He telleth them, that being indeed set at liberty by Christ, they are not therefore any more to enthrall themselves to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny living soule or other creature; not to submit to any ordinance of man <hi>as slaves,</hi> that is, as if the ordinance it selfe did by any proper, direct and immediate vertue binde the conscience. But yet all this notwithstanding, they might and ought to submit thereunto as <note n="b" place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 22.</note> 
               <hi>the Lords freemen,</hi> and in a free manner; that is, by a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary and unenforced both <hi>subjection</hi> to their <hi>power,</hi> and <hi>obedience</hi> to their lawfull <hi>commands.</hi> They must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take heed they use not their liberty for an occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the flesh, nor under so faire a title palliate an evill <hi>licentiousnesse;</hi> making that a cloake for their irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and undutifull cariage towards their superiours. For albeit they be not the servants of <hi>men,</hi> but of <hi>God;</hi> and therefore owe no obedience to <hi>men</hi> as upon imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate tye of conscience, and for their owne sake, but to <hi>God</hi> onely: yet for his sake and out of the conscience of that obedience which they owe to his commands of <note n="c" place="margin">Exod. 20. 12.</note>

            <p>From which words thus paraphrased, I gather 3. ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations: all concerning our <hi>Christian liberty,</hi> in that <note place="margin">§. 5. and divided.</note> branch of it especially which respecteth humane ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and the use of the creatures, and of all indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent things. Either 1. in the <hi>existence</hi> of it, <hi>(As free,)</hi> or 2. in the <hi>exercise</hi> of it <hi>(And not using your liberty for a cloake of maliciousnesse,)</hi> or 3. in the <hi>end</hi> of it, <hi>(but as the servants of God.)</hi> The <hi>first observation</hi> this; We must so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> submit our selves to superiour authority, as that we doe not thereby impeach our Christian liberty: <hi>(As free.)</hi> The <hi>second</hi> this; We must so maintaine our liberty, as that we doe not under that colour either commit any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> sinne, or omit any requisite office either of charity or duty: <hi>(and not using your liberty for a cloake of malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse.)</hi> The third this; In the whole exrcise both of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the <hi>liberty</hi> we have in Christ, and of the <hi>respects</hi> wee owe unto men, wee must evermore remember our selves to be, and accordingly behave our selves as those that are Gods servants: <hi>(but as the servants of God)</hi> The summe of the whole 3. points in briefe this: We must be carefull without either infringing or abusing our liberty, at all times, and in all things to serve God.</p>
            <p>Now then to the severall points in that order as I have proposed them, and as they lye in the text: <note place="margin">§. 6. <hi>Observ.</hi> 1. collected: That Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an liberty</note> (<gap reason="foreign">

impeachment of the liberty you have in Christ. Of which <hi>liberty,</hi> it would be a profitable labour (but that I should then bee forced to omit sundry other things which I deeme needfull to be spoken, and more neere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pertinent to the points proposed) to discover at large the <hi>nature,</hi> and <hi>parts,</hi> and <hi>causes,</hi> and <hi>effects,</hi> and <hi>adjuncts,</hi> that we might the better understand the amplitude of that <hi>dower</hi> which <hi>Christ</hi> hath setled upon his <hi>Church,</hi> and thence learne to be the more carefull to preserve it. But I may not have time so to doe: it shall therefore suffice us to know, that as the other branches of our liberty, whether of <hi>glory</hi> or <hi>grace;</hi> whether from the guilt of sin in our <hi>justification;</hi> or from the dominion of sinne in our <hi>sanctification,</hi> with the severall appendices and appurtenances to any of them: so this branch of it also which respects the use of <hi>indifferent things;</hi> First <note place="margin">1.</note> is <hi>purchased</hi> for us by the blood of <note n="a" place="margin">Ioh. 8. 36. &amp; Gal. 5. 1.</note> Christ, and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore usually called by the name of <hi>Christian liberty.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly is <hi>revealed</hi> unto us outwardly in the preaching <note place="margin">2.</note> of the Gospell of God and of Christ; which is therefore called <note n="b" place="margin">Iam. 1. 25. &amp; 2. 12.</note> 
               <hi>the law of liberty</hi> And thirdly, is <hi>conveighed</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us inwardly and effectually by the operation of the Spirit of God and of Christ, which is therefore called a <note place="margin">3.</note>

            <p>Now this liberty, so dearely <hi>purchased,</hi> so clearely <note place="margin">§. 7. ought to hee maintained: with the proofs thereof.</note> 
               <hi>revealed,</hi> so firmely <hi>conveighed;</hi> it is our duty to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine with our utmost strength in all the parts and branches of it, and, (as the Apostle exhorteth) to <note n="a" place="margin">Gal 5. 1.</note>

especially to those that are in authority; wee must performe our duty therein with all <hi>cheerfulnesse of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> and for Conscience sake, but still with <hi>freedome of spirit</hi> and with liberty of Conscience; as being servants to <hi>God</hi> alone and not to <hi>men.</hi> Wee finde therefore in the Scriptures a peremptory charge both wayes; that we neither usurpe <hi>mastership,</hi> nor undergoe <hi>servitude.</hi> A charge given by our Saviour <hi>Christ</hi> to his Disciples in the former behalfe, that they should <note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 23. 8. 10.</note>

There are againe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things which in my conscience are not absolutely and <hi>in Thesi</hi> unlawfull to be done, which yet <hi>in Hypothesi</hi> and for the like personall respects, I thinke so <hi>unfit</hi> for

me to doe, that I should resolve to undergoe some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience rather then <hi>doe</hi> them; yet still reserving <hi>to others</hi> the like liberty as before, to doe as they should see cause. It belongeth to every sober Christian advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly to consider not onely what in it selfe may <hi>lawfully</hi> be done or left undone, but also what in <hi>godly wisedome</hi> and discretion is <hi>fittest</hi> for him to doe, or not to doe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all occasions, as the exigence of present circumstances shall require.

            </p>
            <p>It may be done a <hi>third way,</hi> and that is by using it <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitably,</hi>

            <p>In which <hi>Objections</hi> (before I come to their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar answer) I cannot but observe the unjust (I would we might not say unconscionable) <hi>partiality</hi> of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecters.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:17139:22"/>
               <hi>First,</hi> in laying the accusation against the <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall lawes</hi> onely, whereas their arguments (if they had any strength in them) would as well conclude against the <hi>politicall lawes</hi> in the civill state; and against <hi>domesticall orders</hi> in private families, as against the <hi>Lawes Ecclesiastical;</hi> yet must these onely be guilty, and they innocent, which is not equall. Let them either <hi>damne</hi> them all, or <hi>quit</hi> them all: or else let them shew wherein they are unlike, which they have not yet done, neither can doe. <hi>Secondly,</hi> when they condemne the <note place="margin">2.</note> things enjoyned as <hi>simply and utterly unlawfull</hi> upon quite other grounds; and yet keep a stirre about <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an liberty;</hi> for which argument there can be no place without supposall of indifferency, (for Christ hath left us no liberty to unlawfull things,) how can they answer this their manifest partiality? <hi>Thirdly,</hi> if they were put to speake upon their consciences, whether or no, if <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> 
               <note place="margin">3.</note> were in their owne hands, and <hi>Church affaires</hi> left to their ordering, they would not <hi>forbid</hi> those things they now dislike, every way as strictly and with as much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of necessity, as the Church presently <hi>enjoyneth</hi> them: I doubt not but they would say <hi>Yea:</hi> and what equity is there in this dealing, to <hi>condemne</hi> that in <hi>others,</hi> which they would <hi>allow</hi> in <hi>themselves? Fourthly,</hi> in some things they are content to submit to the <hi>Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall</hi> 
               <note place="margin">4.</note> 
               <hi>Constitutions</hi> notwithstanding their <hi>Christian liberty,</hi> which liberty they stiffely pretend for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusall of other some: whereas the case seemeth to bee every way equall in both, all being enjoyned by the same <hi>authority,</hi> and for the same <hi>end,</hi> and in the same <hi>maner.</hi> If their liberty be impeached <hi>by these,</hi> why not as much <hi>by those?</hi> or if obedience <hi>to those</hi> may consist with Christian liberty, why not as well obedience <hi>to these?</hi> In allowing some, rejecting others, where there is the same reason of all: are they not very partiall? <note place="margin">§. 40. <hi>the First ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.</hi>

            <p>And now I come to answer their <hi>arguments,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:17139:22"/>
               <hi>flourishes,</hi> for they are in truth no better. That <hi>first</hi> allegation, that the determining of any thing <hi>in unam partem</hi> taketh away a mans liberty to it, is not true. For the liberty of a Christian to any thing indifferent consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth in this; that his <hi>judgement</hi> is throughly perswaded of the indifferency of it: and therefore it is the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the judgement in the <hi>opinion</hi> of the thing, not in <hi>the use</hi> of it that taketh away Christian liberty. Otherwise not onely <hi>Lawes</hi> politicall and Ecclesiastical: but also all <hi>vowes, promises, covenants, contracts,</hi> and what not that pitcheth upon any certaine resolution <hi>de future</hi> should be prejudiciall to Christian liberty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they doe all determine something <hi>in unam partem</hi> which before was free and indifferent <hi>in utramq, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem.</hi> For example: if my friend invite me to sup with him, I may by no meanes <hi>promise</hi> him to come; because the <hi>liberty</hi> I had before to goe or not to goe, is now <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined</hi> by making such a <hi>promise:</hi> neither may a yong man binde himselfe an apprentice, with any certaine <hi>Master,</hi> or to any certaine <hi>trade,</hi> because the <hi>liberty</hi> hee had before of placing himselfe indifferently with that <hi>Master,</hi> or with another, and in that <hi>trade</hi> or in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is now <hi>determined</hi> by such a <hi>contract.</hi> And so it might be instanced in a thousand other things. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to what purpose hath God left indifferent things <hi>determinable</hi> both wayes by <hi>Christian liberty,</hi> if they may never be <hi>actually determined</hi> either way without impeachment of that liberty? It is a very vaine <hi>power,</hi> that may not be brought into <hi>act,</hi> but God made no <hi>power</hi> in vaine. Our Brethren I hope will waive this <hi>first argument,</hi> when they shall have well examined it: unlesse they will frame to themselves under the name of Christian liberty a very <hi>Chimera,</hi> a <hi>non ens,</hi> a meere <hi>notionall liberty,</hi> where of there can be no use. <note place="margin">§. 41. <hi>the second ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.</hi>

            <p>That which was alleaged <hi>secondly,</hi> that they that make such <hi>Lawes</hi> take upon them <hi>to alter the nature of</hi>

For they that make, <hi>Lawes</hi> concerning indifferent things have no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentionat all to meddle with <hi>the nature</hi> of them, they leave that <hi>in medio</hi> as they found it: but onely for some reasons of conveniency to order <hi>the use</hi> of them, the in differency of their nature still being where it was. Nay so farre is <hi>oun Church</hi> from having any intention of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away <hi>the indiff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Especially since her sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity in that declaration (that none may cavill as if it were <hi>protestatio contrariafacto,)</hi> appeareth by these <hi>two</hi> most cleare evidences among many other; in that shee both alloweth <hi>different rites</hi> used in other Churches, and also teacheth her owne rites to be <hi>mutable:</hi> neither of <note place="margin">1.</note> which she could doe, if she conceived <hi>the nature</hi> of the <note place="margin">2.</note> things themselves to be changed, or their <hi>indifferency</hi> to be removed by her Constitutions.</p>
            <p>Neither is that true, which was <hi>thirdly,</hi> alleaged, that where men are bound in conscience to obey, there the <note place="margin">§. 42. <hi>the third ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>conscience</hi> is not left <hi>free,</hi> or else there would be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction. For there is no <hi>contradiction,</hi> where the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative and negative are not <hi>ad idem,</hi> as it is in this case. For <hi>Obedience</hi> is one thing, and the <hi>Thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi> another. The <hi>Thing</hi> is commanded by <hi>the Law of man,</hi> and in regard thereof the conscience is <hi>free:</hi> but, <hi>Obedience</hi> to men is commanded by <hi>the Law of God,</hi> and in regard thereof the conscience is <hi>bound.</hi> So that we are bound in conscience to <hi>obedience</hi> in indifferent things lawfully commanded, the conscience still remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning no lesse <hi>free</hi> in respect of <hi>the things,</hi> themselves so commanded, then it was before. And you may know it by this. In Lawes <hi>properly humans,</hi> (such as are those
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:17139:23"/>
that are made concerning <hi>indifferent</hi> things) the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate</hi> doth not nor can say: This you are bound in conscience: to doe, and therefore I command you to doe it: as he might say, if <hi>the bond</hi> of obedience did spring from <hi>the nature</hi> of the things commanded. But now when <hi>the Magistrate</hi> beginneth at another end, as he must doe, and saith, I command you to doe this or that, and therefore you are bound in conscience to doe it: this plainely sheweth that <hi>the bond</hi> of obedience a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riseth from the <hi>power</hi> in the <hi>Magistrate,</hi> and <hi>duty</hi> in the <hi>subject,</hi> which is of divine ordinance. You may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve therefore that in <hi>humane Lawes</hi> not meerely such (that is, such as are established concerning things sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply <hi>necessary,</hi> or meerely <hi>unlawfull;)</hi> the Magistrate may there derive <hi>the bond</hi> of obedience from <hi>the nature</hi> of the things themselves; as for example if he should make <hi>a Law</hi> to inhibite <hi>Sacriledge,</hi> or <hi>Adultery,</hi> he might then well say, you are bound in conscience to abstaine from these things, and therefore I command you so to abstaine: which he could not so well say in <hi>the Lawes</hi> made to inhibite the eating <hi>of flesh,</hi> or the transportati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>graine.</hi> And the reason of the difference is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent: because those former Lawes are rather <hi>Divine</hi> then <hi>humane</hi> (the <hi>substance</hi> of them being divine, and but the <hi>sanction</hi> onely humane) and so binde by their <hi>immediate vortue,</hi> and in respect of <hi>the things</hi> themselves therein commanded: which the later being meerely humane (both for <hi>substance</hi> and <hi>sanction)</hi> doe not.</p>
            <p>The consideration of which difference and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of it, will abundantly discover the vanity of the <note place="margin">§. 43. <hi>the fourth objection an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>fourth</hi> allegation also: wherein it was objected that the things enjoyned by the <hi>Ecclesiastical Lawes</hi> are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed upon men as <hi>of necessity</hi> to salvation: Which is most untrue. Remember once againe, that <hi>obedience</hi> is one thing; and the <hi>things commanded</hi> another. <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> to lawfull authority is a duty commanded by God
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:17139:24"/>
himselfe and in his Law, and so is a part of that <note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 12. 14.</note> 
               <hi>holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse without which no man shall see God:</hi> but <hi>the things</hi> themselves commanded by lawfull authority, are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in truth <hi>necessary</hi> to salvation, nor doe they that are in authority impose them as such. Onely they are the <hi>object</hi> (and that but <hi>by accident</hi> neither and <hi>contingently,</hi> not necessarily) about which that <hi>obedience</hi> is conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant, and wherein it is to be exercised. An example or two will make it plaine. We know every man is bound in conscience to imploy himselfe in the workes of his <hi>particular calling</hi> with faithfulnesse and diligence; and that faithfulnesse and diligence is a branch of that <hi>holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> and <hi>righteousnesse</hi> which is necessary unto salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Were it not now a very fond thing and ridiculous, for a man from hence to conclude, that therefore draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>wine,</hi> or making of <hi>shoes,</hi> were necessary to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, because these are the proper imployment of the <hi>vintners,</hi> and <hi>shoemakers</hi> calling, which they in consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence are bound to follow, nor may without sin neglect them?

The obligation of the <hi>servants con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi> to doe the things commanded ariseth from the force of that <hi>divine Law</hi> which bindeth <hi>servants</hi> to obey their <hi>masters</hi> in lawfull things: The <hi>master</hi> in the things lie so commandeth, hath no particular <hi>actuall respect</hi> to <hi>the conscience</hi> of his servant, (which porhaps all that

The force of their colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction standeth thus (as you heard already:) that <hi>saith</hi> is ever grounded upon <hi>the word</hi> of God; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whatsoever action is not grounded upon <hi>the word,</hi> being it is not <hi>of saith,</hi> by the Apostles rule here must needes be <hi>a sinne.</hi> Which collection could not be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if the word <hi>Faith</hi> were here taken in that sense which they imagine, and wherein it is very usually ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the Scriptures; <hi>viz.</hi> for <hi>the doctrine</hi> of supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and divine revelation, or for <hi>the beliefe</hi> thereof: which doctrine wee <note n="a" place="margin">See Articles of the Church of England.

But there is a <hi>third signification</hi> of the word <hi>Faith,</hi> nothing so frequently found in the Scriptures as the two former; which yet appeareth both by the course of this whole Chapter, and by the consent of the best and most approved interpreters as well ancient as modern, to have been properly intended by our Apostle in this place: namely that, wherein it is put for a <hi>certaine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion</hi>

            <p>First, it may be demanded, <hi>What power</hi> the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hath, to make a thing otherwise good and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, <note place="margin">§. 19. <hi>The first Question re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved;</hi>
               </note> to become unlawfull and sinfull? and <hi>whence</hi> it hath that power? I answer, <hi>First,</hi> that it is not in the power of any mans judgement or conscience to alter the <hi>naturall condition</hi> of any thing whatsoever, either in respect of <hi>quality</hi> or <hi>degree:</hi> but that still every thing that was <hi>good</hi> remaineth <hi>good,</hi> and every thing that was <hi>evill</hi> remaineth <hi>evill;</hi> and that in the very same <hi>degree</hi> of good or evill as it was before, neither better nor worse, any mans particular judgement or opinion thereof not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding.

               <hi>Outward respects,</hi> (and much lesse then mens opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) can vary.

thereof proceed from a setled and stedfast <hi>resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> or from some <hi>doubtfulnesse</hi> only, or but from some <hi>scruple?</hi> And in respect of <hi>the person,</hi> whether hee be <hi>suijuris</hi> his owne master and have power to dispose of himselfe at his owne choyce in the things questioned; of he be <hi>under the command,</hi> and at the appointment of another?

            <p>The <hi>First Question</hi> then is, If the Conscience be <hi>firmly resolved,</hi> that the thing proposed to be done is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; <note place="margin">§. 23. <hi>as concerning a Resolved conscience, answered in</hi> 2. <hi>conclusions The former</hi>
               </note> whether it may then be done, or no?

yet in truth is not so, but lawfull; the thing by him so judged unlawfull, cannot by him be done without sin. Even <hi>an erroneous conscience</hi> bindeth thus farre, that a man cannot goe against it, and bee guiltlesse: because <hi>his practise</hi> should then run crosse to <hi>his judgement;</hi> and so the thing done could not be of <hi>Faith.</hi> For if his <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> judge it to be <hi>evill,</hi> and yet he will doe it, it argueth manifestly that he hath <hi>a will</hi> to doe evill: and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth a transgressour of that <hi>generall Law</hi> which bindeth all men to <hi>eschew all evill.</hi> Yet in this case wee must admit of some difference, according to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent nature of <hi>the things,</hi> and the different condition of <hi>the persons.</hi> For <hi>if the things</hi> so judged unlawfull be in their owne nature not necessary, but <hi>indifferent,</hi> so as they may either be done or left undone without sinne; and <hi>the person</hi> withall bee <hi>sui juris</hi> in respect of such things, no superiour power having determined his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty therein: then, although hee may not <hi>doe</hi> any of these things, by reason of the contrary perswasion of his conscience, without sinne; yet hee may without si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>flourishing</hi> estate, enjoying <hi>the favour</hi> and living under <hi>the protection</hi> of gracious and religious Princes. Thus <hi>the Constitutions</hi> that the Apostles made concerning <hi>Deacons</hi> and <hi>Widowes</hi> in those primitive times, are with much importunity, but very importunely withall, ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by <hi>the Disciplinarians:</hi> And sundry other like things I might instance in of this kinde, worthy the discovery, but that I feare to grow tedious. Briefely then, the Apostles whole discourse in this Chapter, and so wheresoever else he toucheth upon the point of <hi>Scandals,</hi> is to be understood onely in that case where men are left <hi>to their owne liberty</hi> in the use of indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent things: the <hi>Romanes, Corinthians,</hi> and others to whom S. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote about these matters, being not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited any way in the exercise of their liberty therein by any over ruling authority. But where the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates have interposed, and thought good upon mature advice to impose Lawes upon those that are under them, whereby their <hi>liberty</hi> is (not <hi>infringed,</hi> as some unjustly complaine, in the <hi>inward judgement,</hi> but onely) <hi>limited</hi> in the <hi>outward exercise</hi> of it: there the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall directions will not hold in the same <hi>absolute man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> as they were delivered to those whom they then concerned; but onely in <hi>the equity</hi> of them, so far forth as the cases are alike, and with such meete <hi>qualifications</hi> and <hi>mitigations,</hi> as the difference of the cases otherwise doth require. So that a man ought not out of private fancy, or meerely because he would not bee observed for not doing as others doe, or for any the like weake respects, to doe that thing of the lawfulnesse whereof he is not competently perswaded, where it is <hi>free</hi> for him to doe otherwise: which was the case of these <hi>weake ones</hi> among the Romanes, for whose sakes prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally the Apostle gave these directions. But <hi>the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> of the magistrate intervening so altereth the case, that such a forbearance as to them was <hi>necessary,</hi> is

And thus much of the <hi>second Question,</hi> touching <hi>a doubting conscience:</hi> whereon I have insisted the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, because it is a point both so proper to the Text, and where at so many have stumbled.</p>
            <p>There remaineth but one <hi>other Question,</hi> and that of farre smaller difficulty; What is to be done, when the <note place="margin">§. 33. <hi>as concerning a scrupulous Conscience.</hi>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t perhaps it should prove unlawfull. Such scruples are most incident to men of <hi>melancholy</hi> dispositions, or of <hi>timorous</hi> spirits; especially if they be <hi>tender conscienced</hi> withall: and they are much encreased by the false <hi>sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions</hi> of satan; by reading <hi>the bookes,</hi> or hearing <hi>the Sermons,</hi> or frequenting <hi>the company</hi> of men more strict, precise, and austere in sundry points, then they need or ought to be; and by sundry other meanes which I now mention not. Of which <hi>scruples</hi> it behooveth every man, <hi>first,</hi> to be wary that he doe not at all <hi>admit</hi> them, if he can chuse: or, if he cannot wholy avoid them, that <hi>secondly</hi> he endeavour so farre as may be <hi>to eject</hi> them speedily out of his thoughts, as satans snares, and things that may breed him worser inconveniencies: or, if hee cannot be so rid of them, that then <hi>thirdly</hi> he resolve to goe on according to the more probable perswasion of his minde, and <hi>despise</hi> those scruples. And this he may doe with a good conscience, not onely in things <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi> him by lawfull authority, but even in things <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different</hi> and arbitrary, and wherein hee is left to his owne liberty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:17139:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Much more might have beene added for the farther both <hi>declaration</hi> and <hi>confirmation</hi> of these points. But <note place="margin">§. 34. <hi>The Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi>
               </note> you see I have beene forced to wrap things together, that deserve a more full and distinct handling, that I might hold some proportion with the time.

But it is more then time that I should give place to other businesse: and the most, and most materiall of those directions, have beene here and there occasionally touched in that which hath been delivered already: in which respect I may the better spare that labour. Beseech we God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ so to endue us all with the grace of his holy Spirit, that in our whole conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we may unfainedly endeavour to preserve <hi>a good conscience</hi> and to yeeld all <hi>due obedience</hi> to him first, and then to every Ordinance of man for his sake.</p>
