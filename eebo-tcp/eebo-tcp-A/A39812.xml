            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>With careless Pride at once they charm and vex,</l>
               <l>And scorn the little Censures of their Sex.</l>
               <l>Sure of the unregarded Spoyl, despise</l>
               <l>The needless Affectation of the Eyes,</l>
               <l>The softening Languishment that faintly warms,</l>

               <l>Our matchless Author, who to VVit gave Rules,</l>
               <l>Scorns Praise, that has been prostitute to Fools.</l>
               <l>To factious Favour, the sole Prop and Fence</l>
               <l>Of Hackney-Scriblers, he quits all Pretence,</l>
               <l>And for their Flatteries brings you Truth and Sence.</l>
               <l>Things we our selves confess to be unfit</l>
               <l>For such side-Boxes, and for such a Pit.</l>
               <l>To the fair Sex some Complement were due,</l>
               <l>Did they not slight themselves in liking you;</l>
               <l>How can they here for Iudges be thought fit,</l>

               <l>Our Author lov'd the youthful and the fair,</l>
               <l>But even in those their Follies could not spare;</l>
               <l>Bid them discreetly use their present store,</l>

               <l>No Fury's like a libell'd Blockhead's Rage.</l>
               <l>Hence some despis'd him for his want of VVit,</l>

            <byline>Written by a Person of Quality.</byline>
            <l>'TIS well the Scene is laid remote from hence,</l>
            <l>'Twould bring in question else our Author's sence.</l>
            <l>Two monstrous things, produc'd for this our Age,</l>
            <l>And no where to be seen but on the Stage.</l>
            <l>A Woman ravisht, and a Great man wise,</l>
            <l>Nay honest too, without the least disguise.</l>
            <l>Another Character deserves great blame,</l>
            <l>A Cuckold daring to revenge his shame.</l>
            <l>Surly, ill-natur'd <hi>Roman,</hi> wanting wit,</l>
            <l>Angry when all true <hi>Englishmen</hi> submit,</l>
            <l>Witness the Horns of the well-headed Pit.</l>
            <l>Tell me ye fair ones, pray now tell me, why</l>
            <l>For such a fault as this to bid me dye.</l>
            <l>Should Husbands thus command, and Wives obey,</l>
            <l>'Twould spoil our Audience for the next new Play,</l>
            <l>Too many wanting who are here to day.</l>
            <l>For I suppose if ere that hapned to yee,</l>
            <l>'Twas force prevailed, yee said he would undo yee.</l>
            <l>Struggling, cried out, but all alas in vain,</l>
            <l>Like me yee underwent the killing pain.</l>
            <l>Did you not pity me, lament each groan,</l>
            <l>When lest with the wild <hi>Emperor</hi> alone?</l>
            <l>I know in thought yee kindly bore a part,</l>
            <l>Each had her <hi>Valentinian</hi> in her heart.</l>
