            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

to reſt in ſeeking after the advancement of learning and the increaſe of knowledge, till wee ſhall come to ſee the Father of lights face ro face; the different inclinations of theſe three ſorts of men in the world, leading them to different courſes and ſtraines in their proceedings, and theſe begetting divers encounters amongſt them wherein they diſagree, and know not how to right matters towards one another for mutuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and edification, are the cauſes of all our ſtrife and confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in all affaires, as well of Religious as of civill concernment; nor is it poſſible to be free from the diſorders and diſtempers, which make the life of mankinde uncomfortable in this kind, and full of vexation, till God hath removed thoſe that fall away from their owne ſtedfaſtneſſe out of the earth, which will not come to paſſe till hee hath <hi>filled the earth with the knowledge of</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:117792:16"/>
in diſproportionat frames, or juſtle one another out of their places for contrary ends; ſo all our confuſions and revolutions of Churches and States, and therein of ſcientificall ſtraines, and of practicall undertakings, ariſe differently in the world: here then is a threefold diverſity in acting, the changeable and moveable diſpoſition of the one ſort, is made to try the ſtabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the other two, and thoſe that are ſetled in an ordinary way, are tryers to thoſe that are led forth to ſomething that is extraordinary; and thoſe that upon allowed principles do ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally bring forth ſomething more then ordinary, try the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity of the other two, how farre they love truth for it ſelfe; So that each of theſe puts his neighbour to the triall of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, and conſtraines him to manifeſt the nature of his way, how farre it is, or is not from God: And although every thing which is beyond the ordinary ſtraine, is liable to be cenſured and contradicted by men of ordinary apprehenſions. who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne for the moſt part as extravagant and ridiculous whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is not levell with their capacities; yet I am inclined to believe, that there is alwaies ſomething of God in all men, that are led forth by extraordinary motions, namely when their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits doe not reject the common true principles, and yet are rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed above them, to apprehend concluſions and inferences which are not common; and when their affections are regularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to their workes, and their undertakings purſued with ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety in the feare of God, then I conceive that God hath put upon them a ſpeciall ſtampe and character of his vertue, by which he doth fit them for ſome deſigne and ſervice whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to he hath raiſed them. I have obſerved this in very many men of publike ſpirits, moſt commonly they have bin laught at by others for going out of the common road-way of acting; whether to make good ſome opinions, which others never dreamt of, or to doe ſome buſineſſe which others have thought impoſſibilities to be effected; (I ſay) I have obſerved, that when they have been led forth with modeſty, without ſelfe concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedneſſe and vanity, and when they have proſecuted their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes with remarkable perſeverance, that God hath made them one way or other remarkably inſtrumentall and uſefull to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their generation for the advancement of his worke,
<pb facs="tcp:117792:16"/>
which is the reformation of this world, and the reſtauration of all things by the kingdom of Ieſus Chriſt, whereunto all extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary gifts, and the unuſuall leadings forth of mens ſpirits are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratives. I could inſtance in ſeverall men which I have known, and doe know abroad and at home, of ſeverall profeſſions, whoſe ſtudies and endeavours have been lookt upon as whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies and extravagancies by the road-way-men of that profeſſion; and yet I am perſwaded that they are led and acted by that Spirit which leadeth the children of God in all truth; and becauſe other men otherwiſe rationall and obſervant, (who though not altogether deſtitute of the ſpirit, yet are not raiſed above the ordinary pitch) do not know the drift of the ſpirit of theſe; therefore theſe are lookt upon by them as men of odde conceits: I have ſeen ſome of the great Rabbies of our times, heretofore much ſcandalized at the propoſals and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings of Mr <hi>Comenius;</hi> but it hath pleaſed God to aſſiſt him ſo with grace, and ſupport him with conſtancy in his way, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding many trialls and temptations; that he hath been able during his ownelife, to ſee the uſefulneſſe of ſome of his endeavours, whereof a more full account will be given to the world very ſhortly. I could ſpeake of others, whoſe attempts, though not ſo apparantly ſucceſſefull during their life, yet no leſſe uſefull in their kind, and which in due time, will prove the grounds of great advantages and diſcoveries unto poſterity, although in the generation where their lot is fallen to live, they have not been believed nor received. Gods way to diſpence grace is not according to outward appearances, and for this cauſe, the multitude doth not entertaine the inſtruments there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of with due eſteem, nor the meanes by which it is offered to the world with reſpect, becauſe they come in a homely dreſſe, and without the affectation of any ſhew; nevertheleſſe wiſdom at all times is juſtified by her children, and there take notice of her paths, and trace the counſell of God therein, for they can ſee that Gods waies and counſels reach from end to end, and that he comprehends in his aime both that which is paſt, and that which is preſent, and that which is to come in future ages; ſo that in the concluſion of all, he will make it appeare, that the unuſuall motions of his ſervants, which the world have
<pb facs="tcp:117792:17"/>
diſeſteemed and counted fooliſhneſſe, have been the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary worke of his Spirit in them, whereby he doth convince the world of ſinne, of righteouſneſſe, of judgement: of ſinne, becauſe the teſtimony which they bore to the truth was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; of righteouſneſſe, becauſe they who ſerved their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration faithfully with the righteous uſe of their talent in the midſt of ſcorners, are juſtly taken away from an unthankfull generation and the evill day, to reſt from their labours, that their workes may follow them; and of judgement, becauſe the ſelfe conceited pride and partiality of the wiſe and prudent of this world, ſhall be judged and condemned by the worke of his ſpirit, when he ſhall bring all the effects thereof together to make out his compleate deſigne againſt the world, and by the conjunction of the ſeemingly ſcattered parts which his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants have acted upon their ſtages, produce the new frame of a perfect Scene, the cataſtrophe whereof ſhall make up a buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding fit for the kingdom of his Son.</p>
            <p>I am fallen upon theſe thoughts, and acquaint you thus with them, partly to ſupport mine owne ſpirit againſt the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions which I meet withall in the way wherein God hath ſet me, for the conſtant proſecution of peace and truth without partiality amongſt my brethren; partly to apologize for the drift of your ſpirit, whereby I perceive you have been led theſe many yeares in ſome of your ſtudies; for it is very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to me, that you have ſought after a matter, which to moſt men will ſeem incredible, rediculous and extravagant; and to tell you the truth, before I had read your diſcourſe and ſeriouſly weighed matters, when I thought upon your theme, that the Americans ſhould be of the ſeed of Iſraell, it ſeemed to me ſomewhat ſtrange and unlikely to have any truth in it; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward when I had weighed your deduction of the matter, and lookt ſeriouſly upon Gods hand in bringing into thoſe parts of the World where the Americans are, ſo many religious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, zealous for the advancement of his glory, and who are poſſeſſed with a beliefe from the Scriptures, that all the Tribes of Iſraell ſhall be called to the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the the end of the world: and when I had recollected and laid together ſome other ſcattered and confuſed thoughts
<pb facs="tcp:117792:17"/>
which at ſeveral times I have received, partly from the places of Scripture, which foretell the calling of the Jewes, and their reſtitution to their owne land, together with the bringing back of the ten Tribes from all the ends and corners of the earth, partly from ſome relations which I had heard a few yeeres agoe concerning the ten Tribes, which the Jewes here in <hi>Europe</hi> had given out; and partly from the obſervations of Gods way, which he ſeemes to make by all theſe changes, and the diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the States and Empires of the world, towards ſome great worke, and extraordinary revolution which may ſhortly come to paſſe: all which things when I had called to mind and repreſented unto my ſelfe, I was ſo far from derogating any thing from that which you have conjectured concerning the American Indians; that I beganne to ſtand amazed at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of the probabilities which ſo many waies offered themſelves unto me, to make out and confirme the effect of that which you have ſaid: And then I begun alſo upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther account, to wonder at the ſtrangeneſſe of Gods conduct o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver your ſpirit, that he ſhould have ſet you a worke twelve or more yeeres agoe, after the ſearch of ſuch a matter, by hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall obſervations, whereof then ſo few, and almoſt no foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps at all were extant to be traced, and whereof now, of a ſuddaine, the world is like to be filled with ſuch evidences, that it wil be an aſtoniſhment to all that ſhall heare of it, and lay it to heart; and that all who have any ingenuity will be conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to confeſſe, that indeed there is a God who ruleth in the earth, and that he hath ordered the affaires of the Nations by an univerſal providence, to bring to paſſe his own counſels, and that the things which hee hath revealed by his word, ſhould in the latter times be accompliſhed; for to my apprehenſion, this will be the great benefit of theſe diſcoveries; namely, that the mouths of Atheiſts will be ſtopped, and convicted of irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality and fooliſhneſſe: For when it ſhall appear to all men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably, that the tranſmigration of Nations, and the affaires of this world, have not been carried hitherto by meere chance, or by the craftineſſe of humane counſels, or by force; but by the wiſdome of a Supreame conduct, who hath ordered all things from the beginning towards an end which hath been
<pb facs="tcp:117792:18"/>
foreknown, and to a deſigne foretold. (I ſay) when this ſhall appeare, and that in the midſt of all theſe changes and confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, there is a conduct over-ruling the force of man, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointing the councels of the crafty; then the eyes of all men will be upon the Lord, and God alone will be exalted in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, and the Holy one of Iſraell in judgement: For ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is evident that the ten Tribes of Iſraell have been as it were loſt in the world neare about the ſpace of two thuuſand yeeres, if now they ſhould againe appeare upon the ſtage, firſt as it were in another world by themſelves, and then afterward ſpeedily come from thence hither to the land of their ancient inheritance, where they ſhall be joyned to their brethren the Jews (which is clearly foretold by the Prophets ſhall come to paſſe) if (I ſay) thoſe things ſhould now begin to come to paſſe, what can all the world ſay otherwiſe, but that the Lords coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell <note place="margin">Iſa. 2.

            <p>Now the appearances which offer themſelves unto me, that theſe Prophecies are towards their accompliſhment, are
<pb facs="tcp:117792:18"/>
many, which now I ſhall not inſiſt upon, (perhaps God will direct me to declare them in due ſeaſon more fully then now I can intend) but I ſhall onely mention that which I find to be a confirmation of your conjecture, leaving it to your owne diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, what uſe you will make of it.</p>
            <p>Firſt then I ſhall impart unto you ſome ſtories which I heard five or ſix yeeres agoe, when I was in the Low Countries, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ten Tribes; and then I ſhall adde ſome informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on concerning the ſtate of the Iewes in our Europaean and Aſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atique worlds, which I have learned at other times by ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences which God hath offered unto mee; and upon the whole matter I ſhall leave you to your further conjectures, by that which I ſhall gueſſe at.</p>
            <p>The firſt ſtory which I heard was at the <hi>Hague,</hi> a perſon of chief quality about the Queen of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and one of her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, and a diſcerning godly man, and my ſpeciall friend told me, that the Jew (a Jeweller reſiding ordinarily at the <hi>Hague)</hi> whom I knew, had been there at Court, and with great joy had told, that they of his Nation had received from <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> Letters, bringing to them glad tidings of two ſpeciall matters fallen out there; the one was, that the Grand Seignior had remitted the great taxes which formerly had been laid upon the Jewes of thoſe parts, ſo that now they were in a manner free from all burthens, paying but a ſmall and inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable matter to that Empire; the other was, that a meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger was come unto the Jewes who reſide neere about the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Land, from the ten Tribes, to make enquiry concerning the ſtate of the Land; and what was become of the two Tribes and the half which was left in it, when they were tranſported from thence by <hi>Salmanaſſer.</hi> This Meſſenger was deſcribed to be a grave man, having ſome attendance in good equipage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him. He told them that the people from which hee was ſent were the Tribes of Iſrael, which in the daies of <hi>Hoſea</hi> the King, were carried captives out of their owne Land by the King <note place="margin">2 King. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:117792:19"/>
ſo went from the Heathen where they were placed by <hi>Salma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſar,</hi> with a reſolution to live by themſelves, and obſerve the Commandements of God, which in their owne Land they had not obſerved: in proſecuting this reſolution, after a long journey of a yeere and ſix moneths, they came to a countrey wholly deſtitute of inhabitants, where now they have increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed into a great Nation, and are to come from thence into their owne Land by the direction of God; and to ſhew them that hee was a true Iſraelite, hee had brought with him a Scroule of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> written according to their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome.</p>
            <p>The Gentleman who told me this ſtory, as from the mouth of the Jew, ſaid that it brought to his mind fully (by reaſon of the agreement of circumſtances almoſt in all things) the ſtory which is recorded in the Second Booke of <hi>Eſdras,</hi> which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Apocrypha, Chap. 13. ver. 40. till 50. which will be found a truth if that Meſſenger came and made this Narrative. This was the firſt ſtory; and not long after <hi>viz.</hi> Within the ſpace of five or ſix moneths, a little before I came from the Low Countries, I was told of a Jew who came from <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica</hi> to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and brought to the Jewes reſiding there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> newes concerning the ten Tribes; that hee had been with them upon the border of their Land, and had converſed with ſome of them for a ſhort ſpace, and ſeen and heard remarkable things whiles he ſtayed with them, whereof then I could not learn the true particulars; but I heard that a Narrative was made in writing of that which he had related, which before I went from <hi>Holland</hi> laſt, I had no time to ſeeke after, but ſince the reading of your Booke, and ſome diſcourſe I have had with you about theſe matters, I have procured it from the Low Countries, and received a Copie thereof in French, atteſted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Manaſſeh Ben Iſrael</hi> his hand, that it doth exactly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with the originall, as it was ſent me, the tranſlation thereof I have truly made without adding or taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way any thing; and becauſe I was not ſatisfied in ſome things, and deſired to know how farre the whole matter was believed among the Jewes at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> I wrote to <hi>Manaſſeh Ben Iſrael,</hi> their chiefe Rabbi, about it, and his anſwer I have gotten
<pb facs="tcp:117792:19"/>
in two Letters, telling me that by the occaſion of the Queſtions which I propoſed unto him concerning this adjoyned Narrative <note place="margin">This narrative ſo atteſted and tranſlated, is at the end of this Book.</note> of Mr. <hi>Antonie Monterinos,</hi> hee to give me ſatisfaction, had written inſteed of a Letter, a Treatiſe, which hee ſhortly would publiſh, and whereof I ſhould receive ſo many Copies as I ſhould deſire: In his firſt Letter dated <hi>Novem.</hi> laſt, 25. he ſaies that in his treatiſe he handles of the firſt inhabitants of <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> which he believes were of the ten Tribes; moreover, that they are ſcattered alſo in other Countries, which he names, and that they keepe their true Religion, as hoping to returne againe into the Holy land in due time.</p>
            <p>In his ſecond Letter, dated the twenty three of <hi>December,</hi> he ſaies more diſtinctly thus: I declare how that our Iſraelites were the firſt finders out of <hi>America;</hi> not regarding the opinions of other men, which I thought good to refute in few words onely: and I thinke that the ten Tribes live not onely there, but alſo in other lands ſcattered every where; theſe never did come backe to the ſecond Temple, and they keep till this day ſtill the Jewiſh Religion, ſeeing all the Prophecies which ſpeake of their bringing backe unto their native Soile muſt be fulfilled: So then at their appointed time, all the Tribes ſhall meet from all the parts of the world into two provinces, namely <hi>Aſſyria</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> nor ſhall their Kingdome be any more divided, but they ſhall have one Prince the Meſſiah the Sonne of <hi>David.</hi> I do alſo ſet forth the Inquiſition of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and rehearſe divers of our Nation, and alſo of Chriſtians, Martyrs, who in our times have ſuffered ſeverall ſorts of torments, and then having ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with what great honours our Jewes have been graced alſo by ſeverall Princes who profeſſe Chriſtianity. I prove at large, that the day of the promiſed Meſſiah unto us doth draw neer, upon which occaſion I explaine many Prophecies, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>By all which you ſee his full agreement with your conjecture concerning the Americans, that they are deſcended of the Hebrewes: when his booke comes to my hand, you ſhall have it God willing.</p>
            <p>In the meane time I ſhall adde ſome of my conjectures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Jewes which live on this ſide of the world with us in <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Aſia;</hi> theſe are of two ſorts or Sects, the one is
<pb facs="tcp:117792:20"/>
of Phariſees, the other of Caraits, the Phariſees in <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Aſia</hi> are in number farre beyond the Caraits, they differ from one another whereſoever they are, as Proteſtants doe from Papiſts; for the Phariſees, as the Papiſts, attribute more to the Authoritie and traditions of their Rabbies and Fathers, then to the word of God; but the Caraits will receive nothing for a rule of faith and obedience but what is delivered from the word of God immediately: and their name imports their profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they are readers of the Text, or Textuaries, for ſo the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> you know when it relates to bookes and writings, is to be rendred. Theſe two Sects are irreconcilably oppoſite to each other, and as the Papiſts deale with Proteſtants, ſo do the Phariſees with the Caraits, they perſecute and ſuppres them and their profeſſion by all the meanes they can poſſibly make uſe of: Nay as Mr <hi>Ritangle</hi> (of whom I have all the informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which I know concerning the Caraits) tels me, the hatred of the Phariſees is ſo fierce againſt their oppoſites the Caraits, that they have Anathematized them ſo, as never to be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led unto them; inſomuch, that it is counted unlawfull ſo much as to ſpeake to any of them, or to any that belongeth unto them, but at the diſtance of foure cubits at leaſt; their Bookes and all things belonging to them, are avoided as things abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and to be abhorred; nor will the Phariſees, although the Caraits ſhould become penitent, and deſire to be joyned to their Congregations, and renounce their owne way, admit of them as a Caraite reconciled unto them: but the Caraite muſt firſt become a Chriſtian, a Mahumetan, or an Idolater, before he can be admitted to joyne with them, that it may never bee ſaid that a Phariſee was reconciled to a Caraite, or that a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raite is become a Phariſee. As their principles and affections are thus different, ſo are their opinions, and the courſe of their life extremely oppoſite; the Phariſees are full of ſuperſtitious imaginary fooliſh conceits, and thalmudicall queſtions and ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities in their Sermons and Bookes; the Caraits are rationall men that take up no doctrines but what the Scriptures teach, by comparing one text with another: The Phariſees have wild and extravagant fancies concerning the Meſſiah and his reigne; but the Caraits have true grounds of ſpirituall and raiſed thoughts
<pb facs="tcp:117792:20"/>
concerning the Meſſiah and his Kingdome, little different from that which the better ſort of Chriſtians truly believe, and profeſſe of theſe miſteries. The Phariſees in their Sermons inſiſt upon nothing but their traditions and ceremonies, and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh curioſities; but the Caraits inſiſt onely upon neceſſary and profitable duties, teaching the way of Godlineſſe and honeſty, to bring men from the outward forme to the inward power and ſpirituall performance of divine worſhip.</p>
            <p>As concerning their courſe of life, the Phariſees live every where by a way of trading &amp; uſury, which is deſtructive to thoſe with whom they have commerce; but the Caraits abhor that way, as peſtilent unto humane ſocieties, and betake themſelves to trades, and manufactures, to become husbandmen, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in the places where they live, and to ſerve as Souldiers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Magiſtrate, who doth protect them.</p>
            <p>This being the ſtate and difference of theſe two Sects, (as he who in <hi>Aſia</hi> and ſome part of <hi>Europe</hi> hath been above twenty yeers converſant with them, and a Doctor in their Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues, hath informed me) I ſhall acquaint you with my Conjectures concerning the event of our preſent troubles in the world over all, and the revolution of the Jewiſh ſtate, which are theſe; that it is not unlikely to me that the iſſue and effect of theſe changes which now are wrought, and afoot to bee wrought in the world, (wherein the higheſt powers are ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and a generall diſtreſſe is brought upon all the Nations of the earth) will be a breaking of the yokes of tyranny and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, under which not onely the Jewes every where groan, but with them moſt of the Gentiles, or rather all of them that are under an arbitrary power of abſolute Potentates, and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious ſelfe-ſeeking teachers; that the breaking of theſe yokes is already a great way advanced.

Secondly, in the Northerne and Eaſterne Mahometane Empire, by the changes brought upon, and likely to fall out in the <hi>Ottoman</hi> houſe and line; and by the liberty which of late hath been granted to the Jewes, not onely from taxes, but of repairing to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and having Synagogues there, which heretofore was utterly prohibited. Thirdly, in the Weſterne, which is called the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb facs="tcp:117792:21"/>
or German Empire, by theſe late troubles, and the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which the King of the <hi>North</hi> the Swede, hath given to Proteſtants to maintaine their liberty: All the power of theſe yokes muſt yet further be broken in the Supreame and Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Miniſters thereof; in reſpect of the whole bodies of theſe Empires, and of the particular Kingdomes and States which reſort under the ſame; for all Nations by the light of naturall reaſon, but chiefely thoſe, whom the Goſpel hath enlightned, and prepared in a meaſure, to apprehend the hope of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious liberty of the Sonnes of God, will more and more every where reſent their priviledge and right to a freedome, from which they have been reſtrained, by the miſtery of iniquity in ſpirituall and corporall matters; and when the grounds of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous order, of impartiall love to mankinde, and of common preſervation, ſhall breake forth at laſt, and be taken notice of in the midſt of theſe confuſions and great troubles which fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all ſorts of men; then the Jewes will come and appeare in their owne ranke, and for their own intereſt, they will by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers be reſpected; for their intereſt will be upon the diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Mahometan, to reſiſt and oppoſe the Spaniſh Monarchy, that it may not propagate it ſelfe Eaſtward, and Southward, beyond the Mediterranean Sea; and that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition by which they have been ſo cruelly perſecuted, may be every where aboliſhed; but above all things, kept out of the holy Land and their beloved City <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> If then there ſhould be any tranſactions (as it is ſaid there is like to be) between the <hi>Ottoman</hi> houſe and the houſe of <hi>Spaine</hi> about the Holy Land, the Jewes who are now at ſome liberty there, and begin from all parts of the Earth to lift up their eyes to looke thitherward, will quickely reſent it, and finde their intereſt to be the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their owne inheritance; and to helpe them to it, they will finde aſſiſtance from all Chriſtians that are not ſlaves to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition and tyranny, and that aſſiſtance and favour which by ſuch Chriſtians will be given them, may in Gods hand be a meanes to open the Phariſee his eyes, to ſee ſomewhat in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, from which he hath been hitherto blinded, by reaſon of the prejudice which the Idolatry of the Papall Sea, and the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Inquiſition hath begotten in him. As for the Caraits, God
<pb facs="tcp:117792:21"/>
hath ſo ordered it, that the greateſt bodies of them are in the Northerne parts of the World, by which the ten Tribes, if ever they come to the Holy Land, are like to come; there be ſome few in <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> ſome in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> ſome in <hi>Alcair,</hi> ſome in <hi>Perſia,</hi> and ſome in other places of <hi>Aſia</hi> and of <hi>Africa;</hi> but Mr <hi>Ritangle</hi> told me that their chiefe bodie is amongſt the Aſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atique and European Tartarians, who now appeare upon the ſtage as beginning to be conquerers. For beſides that which they doe fully poſſeſſe in <hi>China,</hi> they have taſted ſomewhat of a victorious progreſſe of late in <hi>Poland,</hi> and they are the next pretenders to the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Crowne, if the line faile, which is like to be: their riſing and diſſipation abroad from their owne centers to their circumferences towards neighbour Nations, will weaken them at home; and if then, when they are not ſtrong within their owne bounds, and by their invaſions have weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their neighbours Southward on; God call the ten Tribes to march toward the place of their inheritance: the Caraits their brethren will be leaders of them on their way, and ſo their march may be, as <hi>Manaſſeh Ben Iſrael</hi> ſaith, to make their Rendezvous in <hi>Aſſyria;</hi> and on the other ſide, the Jewes that are Phariſees, may make their Rendezvous from <hi>Arabia</hi> and other neighbouring places, and out of all <hi>Europe</hi> into <hi>Egypt;</hi> that ſo when the Shunamite ſhall returne (as it is ſaid in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> chap. 6. ver. 13.) the world may looke upon her, and may ſee in her <hi>the company of two Armies,</hi> which both ſhall look towards <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Then will the great battaile of Harma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geddon be fought, whereunto all theſe troubles and changes are but preparatives: then ſhall the ſword of the Spirit, the word of God, prevaile mightily over the ſpirits of all men; the two edges thereof on the right hand and on the left, will cut ſharpe, and pierce to the dividing aſunder of ſoule and ſpirit, and of the joynts and marrow, and to the diſcerning of the thoughts and intentions of the heart: and when this ſword ſhall be thus powerfull in the hands of his Saints, (the true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants with the one troope, and the true Caraits with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) then ſhall be fulfilled the Prophecie of the Pſalmiſt, that <note place="margin">Pſa. 149 7, 8, 9.</note> vengeance ſhall be executed upon the Heathen, and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon the people; that their Kings ſhall be bound with
<pb facs="tcp:117792:22"/>
chaines, and their Nobles with fetters of iron; and that the honour due to all Saints ſhall be given them, to be made execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners of the judgement written in the word of God againſt them. We know not how neare theſe things are at hand, let us therefore be watchfull, and put on the armour of light, to be ready, when the Bridegroome comes, to goe with him in our wedding garment, having our lamps burning, and proviſion of oile, into the wedding chamber. And to this effect, the Lord teach us to be diligent, to be found of him in peace, without ſpot and blameleſſe, that in the midſt of theſe fightings and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions, we may not be found as many are, ſmiting their fellow ſervants, eating and drinking largely of the ſpoile of thoſe that are ſpoiled, and being drunken with the paſſions of malice, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained for the revenge of injuries, or of covetouſneſſe and ambition, proſecuted for ſelf-intereſts: and with this prayer I ſhall commend you to the grace of God, and reſt,</p>

never man dwelt, that they might there keepe their ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, which they never kept in their owne land, and they entred into <hi>Euphrates,</hi> by the narrow paſſages of the river, for through that Countrey there was a great way to goe, namely of a yeere and an halfe, and the ſame Region is called <hi>Arſareth,</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>Eſdr.</hi> 13. 40. &amp;c. <note n="a" place="margin">Acoſt. l. 1. c. 9</note> 
                  <hi>Acoſta</hi> is of opinion that theſe words thus produced by many, make in truth againſt this conjecture, and that for two reaſons. 1. The ten Tribes went ſo farre to keepe their ſtatutes and ceremonies, but theſe Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans obſerve none of them, being given up to all Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries: And is this at all conſequent, ſuch was their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, therefore the ſucceſſe muſt be anſwerable? is it likely they ſhould be ſo tenacious in a farre and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne land, that never kept them in their owne, as the next words expreſſe? His ſecond Argument is of like force, for tis not ſaid, that <hi>Euphrates</hi> and <hi>America</hi> be contiguous, or places ſo neere one the other, much<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe that the entries of that River ſhould ſtretch to the Indies; but hee tells of a very long journey taken by them, ſuitable to the places of their removall, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, which was to a Countrey where never man dwelt, and what Countrey could this be but <hi>America?</hi> all other parts of the world being then knowne and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited: Beſides there hath bin a common tradition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Jews, and in the world, that thoſe ten tribes are utterly loſt; in what place are they then like to be found if not in <hi>America?</hi> for they ſhall be found againe. Some conjectures that they came from <hi>Norway,</hi> and be of that nation, have bin mentioned, with the improbability alſo thereof; and now lately <hi>T.

Their barbarous properties are moſt like the Tartats of any; this argument mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates with more force for their Judaiſme, to which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their rites be ſo conſonant, both ſacred and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, as hath been ſaid.

                  <p>Wee then asked them three queſtions. 1.

                     <hi>November</hi> 11. 1646, Wee came againe to the ſame <note place="margin">Second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</note> Wigwam, there was a greater concourſe, and ſeats pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for us, wee began againe with prayer in Engliſh, and then catechized the younger ſort, wee asked them <note place="margin">p. 8.</note> onely three queſtions in their own language. 1. Who made you and all the world? 2. Who ſhall ſave you from ſinne and hell? 3. How many commandements hath God given you to keepe? The Preacher then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, Wee are come to bring you good newes from the great God, and to ſhew how evill men may come to be good, and be happy while they live, and goe to God when they die; then in familiar deſcriptions hee ſet forth God to them in his glorious power, goodneſſe and greatneſſe, ſhewing what his will was, and what he required, even of the Indians, in the ten Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and how angry God was for any ſinne, yet that hee ſent Chriſt to die for their tranſgreſſions, and to pacifie God by ſuffering in their roome, if they did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and believe the Goſpell, and that hee would love the poore Indians if now they ſought God, threatning wrath againſt all ſuch as ſtood out and neglected ſo great ſalvation, &amp;c. In hearing theſe things about ſinne, and hell, and Chriſt, one of them ſhewed much affliction, <note place="margin">p. 9.</note> deſiring to conceale his griefe; about an houre thus ſpent, wee deſired them to propound ſome queſtions, and the firſt was by an old man, <hi>If it were not to late for</hi>

What doe you remember of that ſpoken to you the laſt time wee <note place="margin">p. 13.</note> were here? after ſome ſpeech among themſelves, one of them ſaid, They did much thank God for our comming, and the things they heard were wonderfull to them; then Secondly wee ſaid, Do you believe the things we tell you, and that God is <hi>Muſquantum, i. e.</hi> very angry for the leaſt ſinne in your thoughts, or words, or works? they ſaid yes, and we ſpake further of the terrors of God againſt ſinners, and his mercy to the penitent, ſeeking after Chriſt; night being almoſt come, conſidering the Indians deſired to know how to pray, and thought that Chriſt did not underſtand their language, one of us ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prayed in their tongue above a quarter of an houre, divers of them holding up eyes and hands, and one of them hung downe his head, with his rag before his eyes, <note place="margin">A weeping In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian.</note> which when hee had wiped, hee held up his head againe, yet ſuch was the power of God upon his heart, that hee hung downe his head againe, covered his eyes, wiping them and weeping abundantly, till prayer was ended, <note place="margin">p. 14.</note> then hee turned to a corner of the Wigwam, and wept
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:117792:76"/>
more by himſelfe, which one of us perceiving, ſpake encouraging words, hee then wept more and more; when he came out of the Wigwan, wee ſpake to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, hee then fell into more abundant weeping, like one deepely affected, ſo as wee could not forbeare wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping over him alſo; wee departed greatly rejoycing for ſuch ſorrowing. And while I am tranſcribing this, I know not whether firſt, to pitty the poore Natives in their ſpirituall diſtres, or ſympathize with the Engliſh in their holy compaſſion, or praiſe God more for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering to the Indians their loſt condition by n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Mr <hi>Elliot</hi> in the beginning of the laſt ſpring prepared for his journey among the Indians, to a great fiſhing <note place="margin">Letter to Mr <hi>Winſlow.</hi> 18. of the 8. 1649.</note> place upon <hi>Merimak,</hi> and hired an Indian to mark trees, and pilot him thither, which he did, with the helpe of ſome Indians, they paſſed by other of the Natives, who had heard of his preaching, and were very glad of his comming that way, but ſickneſſe prevented him at that time; howbeit upon his recovery, he went to another place call'd <hi>Pantuket,</hi> where from all parts they meet, there he asked them if thoſe Indians were deſirous to pray to God, and when they ſaid yea, he demanded how many deſired it, they anſwered <hi>Wamee, i. e.</hi> all. The chiefe Sachim of this place had heard him before, and now ſhewed great affection to him, and the word of God, uſing many arguments to perſwade him to tarry among them, ſaying, his comming but once a yeere did them little good, it was as if one ſhould come and throw a fine thing among them, and they like it well, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell what is within, whether ſomething, or nothing, but if it be opened and they ſee it precious, they ſhould believe it, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Another Indian learning from Mr. <hi>Elliot</hi> that hee had five ſonnes, asked him if they ſhould all teach the Indians to know God, as he did, which when hee affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, the other was well pleaſed, and Mr. <hi>Elliot</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe much encouraged, for hee had often dedicated them in his prayers to that ſervice of the Lord, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring no better preferment for them, than to be fitted for that worke, hee endeavours therefore with that ſmal meanes he hath to traine them up in learning, and God will I doubt not raiſe up ſome liberall hearts and hands to aſſiſt him therein.</p>
                  <p>This ſummer hee was making another journey, but
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:117792:83"/>
in regard of ſome quarrells among the Indians, the Church was doubtfull at firſt of his going, which when the <hi>Nashaway</hi> Sachim heard, he took twenty men armed after their manner, and was his guard, with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neerer Indians, ſo much do they hunger after inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; this was a long journey into the wilderneſſe of ſixty miles, it proved very wet and tedious, ſo that hee was not dry three or foure daies together night nor day, but the Lord upheld him and his company in ſtrength and health. One of the Indians would needs know of Mr <hi>Elliot</hi> the reaſon why they that pray to God, love the Indians ſo doing, more than their owne Brethren, and when the reſt of them ſaid they all found it ſo in their hearts, this gave him occaſion to diſcourſe to them of the unity of the ſpirit.

him and the aforeſaid Indian; ſo that hee tooke an oath hee would ſo informe himſelfe of the whole matter, that hee ſhould know the truth, and that comming out of priſon hee ſhould inſtantly ſeeke the Indian, and would bring to his minde the diſcourſe which they had together, to obtaine by that meanes the ſatisfaction of his deſires. Being then come out of priſon by the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God, he went to the forenamed Port of <hi>Honda,</hi> where hee had ſo much good lucke that hee found in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly the foreſaid Indian, to whom he made his appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and brought into his memory the diſcourſe which they had upon the Mountaine, whereunto he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered that he had not forgotten it, which <hi>Monterinos</hi> hearing, ſaid that he would goe a journey with him, to which hee anſwered that hee was ready to doe him ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: So the ſaid <hi>Monterinos</hi> gave him three Pataques to buy ſome proviſion; whiles then they followed their journey and talked together, the ſaid <hi>Monterinos</hi> at laſt diſcovered himſelfe unto the ſaid Indian, and told him in theſe words, I am an Hebrew of the tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> my God is <hi>Adonay,</hi> and all the reſt are nothing but miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes and deceites; whereat the Indian being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſurprized, did aske him the name of his predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, whereunto hee did anſwer that they were called <hi>Abraham, Iſaac, Iacob</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which the Indian hearing, did aske of him whether hee had none other Father, hee ſaid yea, and that hee was called <hi>Lodwick</hi> of <hi>Monterinos;</hi> but the Indian being not well ſatisfied as yet, ſaid theſe words unto him, on the one ſide I did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce at that which thou haſt ſaid unto me, and on the other I am reſolving to disbelieve thee, becauſe thou canſt not tell mee who were thy Fathers, whereunto the ſaid <hi>Monterinos</hi> anſwered with an oath, that the thing

which hee ſaid was truth, having ſpent ſome time in queſtions and anſwers, and the Indian being wearied at the matter ſaid to him, art thou not the ſonne of <hi>Iſraell,</hi> to which he anſwered, yea, which the Indian having heard ſaid, make an end then of thy ſpeech, for certainly thou didſt put me in ſuch a confuſion that I would have been perplexed at it all my life time; nevertheles let us reſt a little and drinke, and then follow on our diſcourſe.

after which they ſaw a great ſmoake, and in a moment afterward the ſame ſigne with another flagge; and it was not long after that they ſaw in a Boat comming to them three men and one woman, which being arrived to the banke of the River, the woman leapt a ſhoare, and the men tarried in the Boate, which after a long diſcourſe which ſhee had with the Indian, which the ſaid <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terinos</hi> could not at all underſtand, went back to the Boate, and told the three men all that ſhee had heard of the Indian, which came inſtantly out of the Boate (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving alwaies lookt with attention upon him, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſaid <hi>Monterinos)</hi> and did embrace him, and the woman did the like; after this one of the three men went backe againe to the Boate, and the other two together with the woman did ſtay there; which comming neer unto the Indian hee did proſtrate himſelfe at their feete, and they received him with demonſtrations of civility and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and begun to talke with him; after a little while the Indian ſaid to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

               <p>Theſe diſcourſes being all ended, which laſted all that day, they came backe and told him the ſame Wedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day and Thurſday, not adding a word more thereunto. And <hi>Monterinos</hi> being wearied, that they anſwered him nothing to that which hee asked, and that they would not permit him to paſſe the River, did draw neere the Boate in a diſſembling way, and would have caſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe therein to goe to the other ſide, but they thruſt her from the ſhoare with a ſtaffe, and the ſaid <hi>Monte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinos</hi> falling into the water hee was in danger of being drowned, becauſe he could not ſwimme; the men caſt themſelves ſuddenly into the water, and drew him out, and ſhewing themſelves angry, ſaid unto him, doe not

think that thou wilt bring to paſſe thy purpoſe by force; which the Indian declared unto him, and they ſhewed unto him by ſignes and words.</p>
               <p>Notice is to be taken that the Boat for the ſpace of thoſe three daies did not at all ſtay in one place, but four men went and foure other came, which all of them ſaid the ſame nine things which we have mentioned, being all the men who during that time came to ſee him, about 300 more or leſſe.</p>
               <p>Theſe men are ſomewhat burnt with the Sunne, ſome of them weare their haire to their knees, ſome others ſhorter, and others as wee uſe to weare it, faire bodies, good countenances, well made of foot and leg, with a lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen about their heads.</p>
               <p>Moreover the ſaid M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Monterinos</hi> declared, that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from that place on Thurſday at night with a great deale of proviſion which they brought to him, he tooke his leave of them, having been entertained by them, during the three daies which he ſtaied there; and having ſhewed him how they enjoyed all things which the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards have in the Indies, aſwell of meates as of other things needfull for the life of man. Being come the ſame day to the place where they had lien the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Monterinos</hi> ſaid to the Indian, <hi>Francis,</hi> thou doſt know that my Brethren ſaid unto me that thou ſhouldeſt tell me ſomething, therefore I pray thee tell it now to ſatisfie my deſire, whereunto the Indian ſaid, I ſhall tell thee what I know, if thou wilt not anger mee, and ſhall relate unto thee the truth ſo as I have heard it from my Anceſtors, but if thou doſt vex me (which I apprehend, perceiving thee to be ſo ſpeculatif) thou wilt oblige me to tell thee lies; ſo then I beſeech thee take onely heed to what I ſhall ſay unto thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:117792:92"/>
Thy Brethren the ſonnes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were by divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence brought into theſe Countrys, God doing many miracles for them, which thou wouldſt not believe, if I ſhould tell them to thee as I have heard them of my Fathers; Wee Indians went into thoſe Countries and made warre againſt them, and did uſe them worſe then the Spaniards doe us: Afterwards by the command of our Mohanes (theſe are their Sorcerers) wee went as Souldiers towards thoſe parts where thou haſt ſeen thy Brethren, to wage warre with them, and of all thoſe that entred there, not one came backe againe alive; wee made a great Armie, and entring into his lands, all fell downe dead, ſo that not one eſcaped; at laſt wee raiſed another Army, for the making of which the Countrey was diſpeopled wholly, ſo that none but old men, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and children remained therein, which came to an end as the former had done; which thoſe who remained alive, and were not gone to that warre perceiving, ſaid, that the Mohanes had deceived them and were the cauſe of the death of their Fathers, for which they deſerved to be put to death, having then killed many of them, thoſe that remained alive did intreat them to hearken to them, and they would diſcover to them all the truth of that which they knew, which having gotten leave, declared that which followeth.</p>
               <p>The God of theſe ſonnes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is the true God, all that is written in his ſtories is true, they ſhall be Lords of all the world in the latter end, a people ſhall come hither which will bring many things to you, and when the land ſhall be well provided, theſe ſonnes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall goe out of their habitations, and ſhall become Lords of all the earth as it was theirs before, if you will be happy joyne your ſelves to them. The Indian ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb facs="tcp:117792:92"/>
made an end to relate the prediction of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanes, followed on his diſcourſe after this manner, My Fathers were Caciques, and there are yet four of them. Theſe 5 Caciques then having heard what the Mohanes had foretold, as if they had been ſome of the Sages of the Hebrewes, came and tooke their habitation neere that place, to ſee if they could get acquaintance with ſome of thy Brethren. They ſatisfied their deſire after a long time by the interceſſion of an Indian woman: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thy Brethren would never ſpeake to our Fathers, and he of us that went into their Lands, did fall downe dead, and none of thy Brethren did paſſe over to us; we therefore made a League with them, by the meanes of that woman, under theſe conditions. Firſt, that five men, ſonnes to five Caciques or their ſucceſſors, ſhould come to viſit them every ſeventy Moones, and that none ſhould come with them. Secondly, that the man to whom the ſecret was to be declared, ſhould be three hundred Moones old, and that nothing of this ſhould be revealed to him in a place inhabited, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the open field, and when it ſhould be revealed, that it ſhould be in the company of all the Caciques; thus then (ſaid the Indian) wee keepe this ſecreet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, for the great reward which wee hope, for the innumerable ſervices which wee have done to thy Brethren. Wee cannot go to ſee them, but from ſeventy to ſeventy Moones, if no new thing fall out; there hath not been any in my time except thy arrivall which they have ſo much deſired and waited for. I finde no more but three new things according to my reckoning; the firſt, the arrivall of the Spaniards in theſe Countries, the ſecond that Ships arrived in the
<pb facs="tcp:117792:93"/>
South ſea, and the third is thy arrivall. Of all three they have greatly rejoyced, for they ſay that the Prophecies do come to paſſe.</p>
               <p>Moreover the ſaid <hi>Monterinos</hi> declared, that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward hee came to <hi>Honda,</hi> where the ſaid Indian did bring to him three Indian young men, not telling him their names, till hee told him that hee might ſpeake freely with them, ſeeing they were his companions, whith whom hee was in league, and that the other namely the fift was old, and for that cauſe was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to come. The three Indians did imbrace him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately, and asked him of what Nation hee was; to whom hee anſwered, that hee was of the Hebrew Nation, of the Tribe of <hi>Levi;</hi> and then they imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him the ſecond time, and ſaid to him, Thou ſhalt ſee us one day, and ſhalt not know us, wee are thy Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren by a ſpeciall favour which God hath ſhewed us, and having ſaluted him they went away: the Indian <hi>Francis</hi> bid him alſo farewell, and that hee went to ſpeak with his Brethren in the company of the other Caciques. As concerning this Countrey, wee have all the Indians at our command, and when wee ſhall have made an end of theſe cruell Spaniards, wee ſhall goe and draw you out of the ſlavery wherein you are, if it pleaſe God; which he will permit, becauſe his word cannot faile.</p>
