            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>A Repentant Sinner is the Child of Grace, who <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="46"/> being borne for the seruice of God, makes no reckoning of the mastershippe of the world, yet, doth he glorifie God in the beholding of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and in giuing praise to his holy Name, in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of his Work-manship: He is much of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of an Angell, who being sent into the world but to do the will of his Master, is euer longing to bee at home with his fellowes: He desires nothing but that is necessary, and delighteth in nothing that is transitory, but contemplates more then hee can conceiue, and meditates onely vpon the Word of the Almighty; his Senses are the tyrers of his Spirit, while, in the course of nature, his Soule can find no rest: He shakes off the ragges of Sinne, and is cloathed with the Robe of Vertue: he puts off <hi>Adam,</hi> and puts on Christ: His heart is the Anuile of Truth, where the braine of his Wisedome beates the thoughts of his Minde, till they be fit for the seruice of his Maker: His labour is the trauaile of Loue, by the rule of Grace to find the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to Heauen: His feare is greater then his Loue of the World, and his Loue is greater then his feare of God. In summe, he is in the Election of Loue, in the booke of Life, an Angell incarnate, and a blessed Creature.</p>

His breath is the fume of Blasphemy, and his Tongue the fire-brand of Hell: His desires are the destruction of the Vertuous, and his delights are the Traps to damnation: Hee bathes in the bloud of Murther, and sups vp the broth of Iniquity: He frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the Eyes of the Godly, &amp; disturbeth the hearts of the Religious: he marreth the wits of the Wise, and is hatefull to the Soules of the Gracious.
