            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>Some choice Sentences and Sayings concerning the Miſchiefs, and Miſeries which attend an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure, unquiet, and guilty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</head>
               <p>COnſcience is God's ſpy, and Man's overſeer: God's Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty judg, holding its Court in the whole Soul, bearing witneſs of all a Mans doings and Deſires, and accordingly excuſing or accuſing, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving or Condemning, Comforting or Tormenting: What art thou then the better when none is by, ſo long as thy Conſcience is by?</p>
               <p>Conſcience is the great Regiſter, or Recorder of the World. 'Tis to every Man his private Notary, keeping re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of all his Acts and Deeds. <hi>It hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rom thy Heart all thou Contriveſt; And tho its writing may be for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:133614:3"/>
(like to the writing with the juice of an Onion, or Lemon) illegible: Yet when thou comeſt to the fire of Diſtreſs, it will then appear; or at fartheſt, in the great Day of Judgment it will diſcover all.</p>
               <p>Conſcience always keeps Centinel in a mans Soul, and, like a Regiſter, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords all our good and evil Actions. Tho the darkneſs of the Night may hide us from others, and the darkneſs of the Mind may ſeem to hide us from our ſelves, yet ſtill the Conſcience hath an Eye to look in ſecret upon what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver we do: and tho in many Men it ſleeps in regard of motion, yet it never ſleeps in regard of Obſervation and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice: It may be hard and ſeared, but it can never be Blinded: That writing which in it now ſeems to be inviſible, when it's brought to the fire of Gods judgment will be moſt Clear.</p>
               <p>There is nothing ſo much faſtened in the Memory as that which Conſcience writes. All her Cenſures are written with indelible Characters never to be bloted out. All, or moſt of our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge forſakes us in Death: Wit, acute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Variety of language, Habits of Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:133614:3"/>
Arts, Policies, Inventions, &amp;c. only thoſe things which Conſcience im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printeth, ſhall be ſo far from being oblite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by Death, that, they ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by be much more manifeſt, whether they be impreſſions of Peace, or Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</p>
               <p>Conſcience is a moſt bribeleſs Worker. It never know's how to make a falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of any of our ways: 'Tis Gods Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian (with reverence be it ſpoken) that writes not <hi>Annals,</hi> but <hi>Jornals:</hi> The words, Deeds, and Cogitations of Hours and Moments. Never was there ſo abſolute a Compiler of <hi>Lives</hi> as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is. It comes not with prejudice, or acceptation of Perſons, but dares ſpeak the truth of a Monarch, as well as of a Slave. <hi>Nero</hi> the Emperor ſhall find as great a Fire burning in his Boſom, as he dares wrap the poor Chriſtians in, to light him to his Luſts.</p>
               <p>Before and in the acting of Sin we will hear nothing; but afterwards Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience will ſend forth a ſhrill and a ſharp Voyce which ſhall be heard all the Soul over, as was that of <hi>Reuben</hi> to his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th'ren, <hi>did not I warn you, ſaying Sin not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Child,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:133614:4"/>
It's as proper for Sin to raiſe Terrors in the the Soul, as for rotten Fleſh or Wood to breed Worms. That worm which never dieth is bred here in the froth of filthy Luſts, and flagitious Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and it lyes grubbing and gnawing upon Mens inwards many times, in the Ruff of all their jollity. This made <hi>Saul</hi> to call for his Muſick, <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> for his carouſing Cups, <hi>Cain</hi> for his Workmen to build him a City; and others for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Devils <hi>Anodines</hi> to put by the Pangs of their wounded Spirits, and throbbing Conſciences.</p>
               <p>One ſmall drop of an evil Conſcience will trouble a whole Sea of outward Comforts and Contentments; A conflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence whereof would no more eaſe a wounded Conſcience, than a Silken Stoking will do a broken Legg.</p>
               <p>As a little water in a Leaden Veſſel is heavy: So is a little trouble in an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Conſcience.</p>
               <p>An evil Conſcience is a burden impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, able to quail the Courage, and cruſh the Shoulders of the ſtrongeſt <hi>Hercules,</hi> of the mightieſt man upon Earth: Hence <hi>Job</hi> preferred, and <hi>Judas</hi> choſe ſtrangling before it. <hi>Daniel</hi> choſe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:133614:4"/>
rather to be caſt to the Lyons, than to carry a Lyon about with him in his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome an, enraged Conſcience. The pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians alſo uſed to cry out, <hi>Ad leones potius quam ad Lenones abjicia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur:</hi> Let us rather be caſt to the Lyons than to be thruſt into Brothel-houſes.</p>
               <p>What good is there in a Cheſt full of Goods, when the Conſcience is empty of goodneſs? ſuch an one is like unto <hi>Naaman,</hi> a Rich man, but a Leper. For excellent Parts and Gifts, without a good Conſcience are but as ſo many ſweet Flowers upon a Dead man wrapped up in fair Linnen: Or like to <hi>ſounding Braſs, or a tinkling Cymbal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Conſcience is God's greateſt Officer and Vice-gerent in Man, ſet by him to be, as it were thy Angel keeper, Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, Remembrancer, King, Prophet, Witneſs, Examiner, Judge, yea, thy lower Heaven. If thou ſlighteſt and wrongeſt it, it will be an Adverſary unto thee, and an informer againſt thee, an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer, Witneſs, Judg, Jailor, Tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, a Worm, Wrack, Dungeon unto thee; yea, thy upper Hell.</p>
               <p>An evil Conſcience makes the <hi>Wicked fly when none purſues, Prov.</hi> 28. 1. Such
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:133614:5"/>
a fearful Fugitive was bloody <hi>Cain,</hi> ſuch were thoſe curſed <hi>Canaanites (Joſ.</hi> 24. 12.) that were chaſed by Gods Hornets among them, that is, by the Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hounds of their own Conſciences. Such were thoſe <hi>Syrians,</hi> who, ſtruck with a <hi>Pannick</hi> fear, fled for their Lives, and left their rich Camp for a Booty to the Hunger-ſtarved <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 7. 7. &amp;c. The ſhadows of the Mountains ſeemed to be armed men to guilty <hi>Gaal, Judg.</hi> 9. 36. The <hi>Burgundians,</hi> when ready to joyn Battel with their Enemies, thought that long Thiſtles were Spears.</p>
               <p>He that is delivered up to a ſeared Conſcience, to a dead and dedolent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſition, is in a manner in a deſperate condition. He <hi>heaps up wrath againſt the Day of Wrath,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 5. this made a reverend Man ſay, <hi>I had rather be in Hell with a ſenſible Conſcience, than on Earth with a reprobate Mind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plutarch</hi> thought that the very Life of a vicious and a wicked man, was pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment enough for him without either Gods or mans revenging hand. For (ſaith he) if they examine their Lives, they find themſelves empty of Grace and Goodneſs, deſtitute of Hope, loaden
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:133614:5"/>
with Fear, Sadneſs, uncheerfulneſs, and of Suſpicion of what will follow after. Their lives therefore are worſe than the life of a Dog: For a Dog lives without mental ſufferings, and dyes, and there is an end of him: But this wicked man is always upon the Rack whilſt he lives, being perpetually tormented with the laſhes of an Evil and accuſing Conſcience, which is worſe than Death.</p>
               <p>As the Crocodile incautiouſly ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his Mouth open, receives into his Belly the <hi>Ichneumon,</hi> or <hi>Indian-Rat,</hi> which cauſes that he is never at quiet, his entrails never being free from gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Pain. One while he plunges into the water, and anon runs again to the Land: No place will afford him caſe till Death hinders his Motion: So it is with ſuch as are tormented with the Worm of Conſcience; As we ſee in <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi> when he had murthered his Mother, and his Wives. And in <hi>Otho</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, when he had ſlain <hi>Galba,</hi> and <hi>Piſo, In Herod,</hi> when he had cauſed his Wife <hi>Mariamne</hi> to be put to Death. And in our King <hi>Richard</hi> the third, when he had ſlain his two innocent Nephews in the Tower. In <hi>Spira; Latomus,</hi> and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:133614:6"/>
many others: all which were ſo gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and grub'd with this Worm that they could never be at reſt, till, being utterly tired with continual Vexation of Spirit, they either deſperately flew themſelves, or were dreadfully diſpatched by others.</p>
               <p>In thy Commiſſion of evil, fear no man ſo much as thy ſelf; another is but one Witneſs, but they Conſcience is a Thouſand. Another thou may'ſt avoid, but thy Conſcience thou canſt not. Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs is its own Puniſhment.</p>
               <p>No man is able to ſtand before a guilty Conſcience. The Conſcience awaken'd is like a Bear enraged; It tears a man in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: It falls upon him like ſome mighty Tower, and cruſhes him to Powder. It is like a Gouty joynt, ſo ſore and Painful, that it cannot endure it ſelf; as <hi>Bernard</hi> ſpeaks. How was <hi>David</hi> wounded, his Bones bruiſed by it, &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. 3. &amp;c? How many have we ſeen to lye Panting and Groaning under the wounds of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience? Oh what Horrors, Fears, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions have the Tongues and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſome of God's own Children im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to ſtanders by! And if their Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies have been ſuch who have been but in part wounded, and withal, ſecretly
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:133614:6"/>
ſuſtained, what then muſt the Caſe of the wicked needs be, when his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience falls with a full weight upon him, and there is no ſupporting? <hi>Prov.</hi> 18. 14. <hi>A wounded Spirit who can bear?</hi> The Gout, Stone, and ſome other Diſeaſes are in themſelves almoſt inſufferable: Yet the Spirit of a man, ſuſtained with hope and ſtrengthened by God may ſomewhat tug with them: But when the Spirit which ſuſtains all, is it ſelf wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; when God, that other where ſupports, becomes an Enemy, who can bear it? For</p>
               <p>Here is not a Creature to a Creature, Weakneſs to weakneſs, but a finite Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture muſt encounter with an infinite Power; Weakneſs muſt fight with Strength; Man with God. Alaſs! when the Heavens fall upon a poor Worm, muſt he not needs down? when <hi>Judas</hi> ſhall have the Earth againſt him, and Hell againſt him, and Heaven againſt him, and himſelf againſt himſelf; muſt he not needs ſhrink, and fall?</p>
               <p>Oh! How miſerable is the condition of every impenitent Sinner! Poor wretch, he goes on in a ſinful courſe and fears no harm. His Conſcience

Sometimes in this Life a ſpark of Hell falls upon his Soul, and then where is he? Can he quench this flame with the pureſt Wines? Shake of theſe fits with a peal of Laughter? Can he out-ride the ſhriches of his Conſcience as he follow's his Games? Can he drown that noiſe with his cryes, and Hubbubs? Can he forget thoſe gripings in his buſieſt Tales, and relations of News? Or can he leave his Conſcience behind him in any place?</p>
               <p>No, no, his Conſcience is his conſtant Companion, and cryes upon him in the Night ſleeping, in the Day walking; In his greateſt Mirth; In his buſieſt Sports and Paſtimes: Nay, his Heart is now employed about another buſineſs: His deſires are full of Solitarineſs; His Thoughts as black as Hell it ſelf. The Devil (ſaith he) what Creature is he? My fleſh trembles at the thoughts of him, yet would I might ſee him. Hell (thinks he) what place is that? Sith

Witneſs <hi>Judas!</hi> He comes to the Prieſts, and looks upon them, but they cannot eaſe him. He takes his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and looks upon that, but it cannot help him. He walks forth and looks upon the Light, and is weary of that. He paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by men, he hath nothing to ſay; He is beſt alone, nay, not alone; If there be any hope it is in Hell; If any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort it is among the Devils; thither he will go to ſeek it. Oh miſery! Oh Death! Oh Hell! when a man muſt go to Hell for eaſe, to the damned Spirits for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort!</p>
               <p>A guilty Conſcience as it will prove the moſt inmoſt, ſo the utmoſt Enemy, and that,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> unavoidable: Do what thou canſt, thou canſt not ſhake it off: It lyes with thee; it ſleeps with thee; it Rides with thee; it wakes with thee; it walks with thee, in every place, beyond all times; when thou goeſt it goes; when thou flyeſt it runs; ſtill it cries and raiſes the Country againſt thee. It meets thee in the dark and makes the leap: It meets
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:133614:8"/>
thee in the Day, and makes the quake: It meets thee in thy Dreams and makes thee ſtart: It meets thee in every Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and makes thee think every Buſh to be a man, every man a Devil, every Devil a meſſenger to carry thee quick to Hell?</p>
               <p>Thou com'ſt to thy Chamber, there thy Conſcience frights the: Thou com'ſt to the Field there it turns thee: Thou turneſt again, and their it Croſſes the way upon thee: Thou turn'ſt it turns: Thou cryeſt it cries: thou dareſt not call, if thou doeſt Conſcience fears no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Unſufferable: An evil Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſtrips one of all Comfort at once: If a ſick Stomach will make one a weary of all Chairs, Beds, Meats, Drinks, Friends, All: Oh what will a ſick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience do!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It puts one to intollerable Pains. It racks the Memory and makes it run back twenty years, as we ſee in <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi>'s Brethren; and <hi>Ariſtocrates</hi> in <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch.</hi> Yea, it twinges for Sins in youth as <hi>Job</hi> complain's. It racks the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and carries it forward beyond the Grave, and makes it feel the very bittterneſs of Death and Hell before it
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:133614:8"/>
ſees them: It racks the Phantaſie and makes it ſee Ghoſts in men, Lyons in Children, as it's ſtoried of ſome: It trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles the Eye, and makes a murthering <hi>Theodorick</hi> ſee the Face of a Man in the mouth of a Fiſh: It troubles the Ear, and makes a <hi>Beſſus</hi> hear the cry of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the chattering of Birds: It racks all the Senſes quite out of joynt; it makes a <hi>Sanders</hi> to run over the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Mountains quite out of his Wits till he periſh of hunger. In brief, it ſo oppreſſes that it cauſeth the ſweating Soul to cry with <hi>David,</hi> Oh my Bones are bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken! And with <hi>Moſes, who know's the power of his Wrath?</hi> And to joyn with <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, a wounded Spirit who can bear?</hi> what Man? what Angel? Who under Chriſt? Nay, this ſtroke upon the Soul, (ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from all Sin) drew from the Lord of Life, thoſe ſad cryes, <hi>My God my God why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> That which a Thouſand taunts, ten Thouſand racks could not have done, this one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone apprehended and felt, wreſted from him. And ſhall ſuch a thing as this, ſo near, ſo great a Neighbour be offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?</p>
               <p>Be we then of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s mind: Set
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:133614:9"/>
Conſcience at an high Price: Conſider what it will be worth in the Day of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, of Death, of Judgment, and reſolve to begg, ſtarve, burn, dye a Thouſand deaths to ſave Conſciences life.</p>
               <p>As a good Conſcience (next to God its Maſter) is our beſt Friend in the World; ſo Conſcience offended is our foreſt Enemy. The greateſt Friends are bittereſt Foes when divided. No Wars to Civil Wars, to domeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Wars. The nearer the worſe; and therefore the Conſcience (being neareſt) if it become an Enemy, is the heavieſt of all others. For</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> It's an unavoidable Enemy, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Enemies may be kept off with ſtrength, or put off with skill; but ſo cannot Conſcience; No Barrs, no Bolts, no Bulwarks can keep that from thy Table, or Bed. <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 5. <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> may ſooner keep out ten Thouſand <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> than one Conſcience: That will paſs through all his Guards and Officers to his preſence, and in the Face of his Nobles and Concubines, arreſt him, and ſhake him in deſpight of his ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Nor will this Officer be bob'd with a bundle of Diſtinctions, and Evaſions.

When God ſets it a work, it marches fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly (like <hi>Jehu)</hi> and will take thee up with his anſwer; <hi>What Peace ſo long as thy Whoredoms and ſins remain?</hi> As there is no <hi>Reſpondent</hi> like Conſcience, ſo there is no <hi>Objector</hi> like to that. A man may make a ſhift with a wrangling <hi>Sophiſter,</hi> yea, with the Devil himſelf, better than with his Conſcience. For no Devil knows that by me which I do by my ſelf. And the Conſcience ſhall have the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when the Devil ſhall not. For Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is the Kings Solicitor, and ſpeaks for the great King.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> This Enemy is unſufferable. It ſtrips us at one ſtroke of all other Comforts; a ſick Stomach makes that meat which before much pleaſed, now to encreaſe the Diſeaſe: So doth a ſick Conſcience: It takes away the reliſh of all natural Comforts, and of all ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Exerciſes, and Ordinances, and makes a man a burden and terror to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>It fills one full of Horrors and unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; the Violenteſt diſeaſes may be born; but when the Pillers are ſhaken, when that which bears up all is wounded: when the Heavens fight againſt a man,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:133614:10"/>
and a poor Creature muſt wreſtle againſt infinite juſtice and power, Oh how hard a thing is this! The wrath of a King is terrible, and the rage of Seas, of Fire, of Lyons; but ſtill here is Creature againſt Creature, Weak to Weak; but <hi>who knows the power of Gods anger?</hi> Who can <hi>ſtand before that conſuming Fire?</hi> Not man: Not mountains: Not Angels. The ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of God and anguiſh of Spirit caſt's the Devil himſelf into a frenzy and makes him mad.</p>
               <p>As thoſe parts of the Nail next to the fleſh, at firſt are ſofter than the reſt, but after a while they grow into that hardneſs which is in the remoter parts: So the Conſciences of all men have thoſe ſeeds of inſenſibility in them, which makes them at laſt deaf to every Charm, and ſecure againſt all the thundering Judgments which are denounced againſt them.</p>
               <p>As the operation of the Sun is always ſtrongeſt there where it is not at all ſeen; to Wit, in the Bowels of the Earth. So the judgments of God do oft lye heavieſt there where they are leaſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, to Wit in an hard Heart, and ſeared Conſcience.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:133614:10"/>
When men go about to extinguiſh and darken the light of direction which God hath put into their Hearts and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences to guide their paths by, he puts out their light of Comfort, and leaves them to Darkneſs and Sorrow.</p>
               <p>Other afflictions are but the taking ſome ſtars of Comfort out of the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when others are left ſtill to ſhine there: But when God's countenance is hid from the Soul, the Sun it ſelf (the fountain of Light) is darkned to ſuch, and ſo a general Darkneſs befalls them.</p>
               <p>A light Load upon a raw Shoulder is very grievous: So is a little outward grief to a wounded Conſcience,</p>
               <p>Every fowl that hath a beautiful Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath not the ſweeteſt Fleſh: Nor doth every Tree that beareth a goodly Leaf, bring good Fruit. Glaſs gives a clearer ſound than Silver, and many things gliſter beſides Gold: The wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man's jollity is but the Hypocriſie of mirth; It may wet the Mouth but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not warm the Heart: Smooth the Brow, but not fill the Breaſt. In the midſt of his greateſt mirth he hath many a ſecret gripe in his Conſcience, and little knows the World where his ſhooe pinches him.

               <p>COnſcience is a Prime faculty of the reaſonable Soul, there ſet to give notice of its ſpiritual Eſtate, in what Terms it ſtands with God.</p>
               <p>Conſcience (ſaith St. <hi>Auſtin)</hi> is like a Wife; the beſt of Comforts if good, the worſt of naughts if bad.</p>
               <p>Deal friendly with Conſcience, and, next to God, it will prove thy beſt friend in the World.</p>

                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The ſweeteſt Friend in the World. If natural cheerfulneſs be ſo good an Houſe-keeper to a good man

that it Feaſts him daily (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith) Oh then what will be the Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets of a Conſcience ſanctified, purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and pacified! What joys thoſe that will carry a man above ground, and make him forget the beſt of Natures Comforts! what Comforts thoſe that will make him ſing under the Whip, in the Stocks, at the Stake in deſpite of the Fire! Oh what the ſtrength of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience that can ſooner tyre the Tyrant than the Martyr! And can carry weak Strength (as weak as Water, as it were) in Triumph through a World of Bonds, Rods, Swords, Racks, Wheels, Flames, Strapadoes, and whatſoever elſe is moſt terrible! Theſe joys are impregnable, and unſpeakable indeed. This <hi>Peace</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable, <hi>paſſes all underſtanding.</hi> This Friend is unmatchable. Let not ſuch an one ſo true, ſo faſt, ſo good, be ſlighted, or offended.</p>
               <p>Therefore let us be of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s mind; ſet Conſcience at an high Price: Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what it will be worth in a day of Trouble, of Death, of Judgment: Weigh what the Price of Conſcience would be at in Hell if men might buy their Peace, and Rate it accordingly.</p>

Look how chary a proud Woman is of her Beauty, a Wiſe-man of his Eye, a Weak man of his Stomach: So, and much more than ſo ſhould a Chriſtian be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of his Conſcience: Of his Heart, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 23. <hi>Keep thy Heart with all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pet.</hi> 23. 1. <hi>I have lived in all good Conſcience before God, until this day: Heb.</hi> 13. 18. <hi>We truſt we have a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in all things, willing to live honeſtly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Give Conſcience content and reſt, and it will pay thee an Hundred-fold. It will round thee in the Ear and ſay, this is well however it be taken, and therefore be not diſcouraged: This is naught however applauded and Painted: 'Tis ſtark ſtaring naught; 'Tis Pride, Hypocriſie, therefore amend it.</p>
               <p>Other Friends go and come, and ſtand afar off, now at hand, now I know not where; But Conſcience is no ſtarter. 'Tis never from our ſides, out of our Boſoms.</p>
               <p>A pacified Conſcience, what a Bleſſing is that? What joys be thoſe, which will carry a man out of the Earth, and make him ſay; Tho I have Wife, Children, Friends, Wealth, Houſe, Health, Eaſe, Honour, &amp;c. after mine own Hearts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:133614:13"/>
yet theſe are nothing to my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and Contentment within? Oh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience! Thou haſt a ſpecial gift in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting, that canſt make the Patient laugh and rejoyce when the Spectators weep and mourn, and canſt carry frail Fleſh ſinging and rejoycing thorough a World of Miſeries: Theſe joys be ſtrong indeed, and paſs mans underſtanding, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 7.</p>
               <p>Other Friends love not to come to a Sick-mans Bed-ſide; Or if they do, they cannot abide to hear his groaning, to ſee a Dead man; At the moſt, they can but follow him to the Grave: But Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience will make a mans Bed in his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and cauſe him to lye the ſofter: It will ſtand by him when he groans, and Comfort him: It will hearten him againſt Death when it's coming, and ſay, <hi>thy Redeemer lives:</hi> It will whiſper to him when departing, and ſay, <hi>Thy Warfare is accompliſhed:</hi> It will lodge the Body in the Grave as in a Bed; accompany the Soul into Heaven, and enable it to look God in the Face without any terror. So faſt a Friend is this, that when Riches, Husband, Parents, Friends, Breath, Life; Nay, when Patience, Hope, Faith have
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:133614:13"/>
left us in ſome meaſure, this will not leave us.</p>
               <p>That's the beſt Glaſs which ſhews the ſmalleſt ſpots: The brighteſt Light that ſhews the leaſt Motes: The fineſt Fleſh that is ſenſible of the leaſt pricking: So that Conſcience that is ſenſible of the leaſt Sin or failing, is the Perfection of Chriſtianity, whereunto we ſhould all endeavour to attain.</p>
               <p>If you lay an heavy burden upon a ſound Shoulder, it goes away with it well enough: So if the Soul and Conſcience be ſound, and God enable a man to bear it, Diſeaſes, Impriſonment, Diſgrace &amp;c, are eaſily born.</p>
               <p>As the cleereſt Blood makes the beſt Spirits: So doth a good Life the quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Conſcience. The pureſt air breeds the greateſt agility, and the pureſt Life the faireſt Hope.</p>
               <p>A natural Conſcience ſhews only the danger of Sin; and ſo makes a man fear it; But a ſpiritual Conſcience ſhews the filthineſs and pollution of Sin, and ſo makes a man hate it.</p>
               <p>A good Conſcience appears in the Countenance, and looks merrily out at the Windows of the Eyes. But this is
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:133614:14"/>
not till Faith hath healed the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. This made <hi>Stephen</hi> to look like an <hi>Angel, Act.</hi> 6. 15. and the Apoſtles to rejoyce in their ſufferings, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 41. This is <hi>Praemium ante praemium,</hi> even Heaven afore-hand: ſome Cluſters of Grapes of that <hi>Celeſtial Canaan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A good Conſcience will not only ſtand under the greateſt preſſures, as we ſee in St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 9. 12. <hi>We had the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Death in our ſelves, that we ſhould not truſt in our ſelves, but in God which raiſeth the Dead. For our rejoycing is this, the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of our Conſcience, that in ſimplicity and Godly ſincerity, not with fleſhly Wiſdom, but by the Grace of God, we have had our Converſation in the World.</hi> But goes as merrily to Dye, in a good cauſe, as ever he did to Dine, as we ſee in divers of the Martyrs. Be the Air cleer or Clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, he enjoys a continual ſerenity, and ſits always at the bleſſed Feaſt, whereat the Angels are continually the bleſſed Cooks and Butlers (as <hi>Luther</hi> phraſeth it) and the three Perſons of the Trinity are gladſome Gueſts.</p>
               <p>A good Conſcience is a full Feaſt, a laſting Feaſt, not for a day, as was <hi>Nabal</hi>'s: Nor for ſeven dayes, as was
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:133614:14"/>
that of <hi>Sampſon:</hi> No nor for nineſcore dayes, as was of that <hi>Ahaſherus:</hi> But a durable Feaſt without intermiſſion of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, or interruption of Society. <hi>Vis ergo (O Homo) ſemper epulari?

               <p>
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 17. 22. <hi>A merry Heart doth good like a Medicine.</hi> All true mirth is from the peace of Conſcience: When Faith hath healed the Conſcience, there is a <hi>Sabbath</hi> of reſt, and bleſſed tranquillity lodged in the Soul, and then the Body alſo is vigorous for the moſt part, and in good plight and healthful.</p>

                  <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9. 7. &amp;c. <hi>Go thy way</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi> there to one that hath a good Conſcience) <hi>Eat thy Bread with joy, and drink thy Wine with a merry Heart—Let thy Garments be always White, and let thy Head lack no Oyntment,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>Let a man be ſound within, and at Peace with his own Conſcience, and he will be able bravely to bear up under un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Preſſures, as did St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 9. 12. as an old beaten Porter to the Croſs: <hi>Maluit toller are quàm deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare:</hi> His ſtroak was heavier than his groaning, <hi>Job</hi> 23. 2.</p>
               <p>Conſcience is frequently in Scripture called <hi>the Spirit of a Man,</hi> as being plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God in every part of the reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Soul, where ſhe produceth, occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, ſeveral Operations, as being the Souls School-Maſter, Monitor, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtical Preacher: God's ſpy, and Man's Over-ſeer: The principal Commander, and chief Controuler of all his Deſires, and doings.</p>
               <p>Conſcience is a moſt Celeſtial gift<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is ſo of God and in Man, that it is a kind of middle thing between God and Man; leſs than God, and yet above man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It may be called <hi>our God,</hi> in the ſenſe that <hi>Moſes</hi> was called <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s God, having Power to controul and avenge our diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience with greater plagues than ever <hi>Moſes</hi> brought upon <hi>Egypt.</hi>

Many ſeek for knowledge, few care for Conſcience; yet is Conſcience got with more eaſe, and kept with more advantage than all our Science.</p>
               <p>Keep Conſcience pure, and it will keep thee in Peace. Let men, the World, and the Devils do their worſt, they cannot hurt him that hath a good Conſcience, ſaith <hi>Bernard.</hi>

               <p>A good Conſcience is the <hi>Paradiſe</hi> that God walks in, the Throne that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſits upon; the Temple that the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit dwels in; the Golden-pot wherein is kept the hidden <hi>Manna,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Conſcience is the Book of Books; the ancienteſt piece of Scripture in the world. The firſt Tables of God's own hewing, and Hand-writing in the Heart of Man, for whoſe ſake all other Books ſince, yea, the Scripture it ſelf, was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards written on purpoſe to Comment upon it.

A good Conſcience hath a ſecure Confidence, and he that hath it, ſits <hi>(Noah-</hi>like) <hi>mediis tranquillus in undis:</hi> Quiet in the greateſt Combuſtions: Freed, if not from the common De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, yet from the common Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction.

               <p>There are four quiet Conſciences, and never a one of them good.</p>
               <p>

               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The obdurate Conſcience. Theſe <hi>Treaſure up wrath againſt the day of Wrath, Rom.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>Job</hi> 36. 13. There is no greater a Plague than ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David,</hi> before he was ſmitten, either by God's hand, or by the Prophet's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, his own ſanctified Conſcience did the Office of a faithful Monitor, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:133614:17"/>
houſhold Chaplain; For his Heart pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently miſ-gave him, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21. 8. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24 10. Bee-Maſters tell us that thoſe are the beſt Hives that make the greateſt noiſe: Sure it is, that that is the beſt Conſcience that ſuffers not a man to ſleep in Sin. <hi>David</hi>'s heart ſmote him for numbring the People; It was for his own, for a ſmall, for a ſecret Sin; For failing in the manner only; For he knew that a man might as well dye of an in ward bleeding, as of an outward Wound. The good Soul is often afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for it's failings in thoſe Duties which others applaud and extoll.</p>
               <p>A good and a peaceable Conſcience (ſaith <hi>Bernard) eſt lectus Animae.</hi> The Bed on which the Soul takes ſweet repoſe.</p>
               <p>Behold the Conſidence of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience towards God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21. when it is parling with God by <hi>Prayer,</hi> and bold interceſſion! It dares plead with God as <hi>Jeremy</hi> did, <hi>Righteous art thou, O Lord, when I plead with thee: Yet let me talk with thee of thy Judgments,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Jer.</hi> 12. 1. And interrogates as St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 8. 33, 34, 35. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? It is God that juſtifies: Who is he that Condemns,</hi> &amp;c?
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:133614:18"/>
And expoſtulates with God as <hi>David</hi> often did. When God ſeems to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep he will awaken him: When to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay he will quicken him: When to have loſt his wonted kindneſs, he will find it for him.</p>
               <p>In pure Water the Face may be ſeen, not ſo in muddy: So in a pure Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence Gods Face may be ſeen, and no where elſe in the Earth.</p>
               <p>As Faith makes the Conſcience good before God, ſo Purity makes it good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men.</p>
               <p>The unlearned man with a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience (ſaith St. <hi>Auſtin)</hi> will go to Heaven, when thou with all thy Learning ſhalt be caſt into Hell. <hi>Surgunt indocti &amp; rapiunt Regnum Coelorum,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Faith looks to Promiſes; Fear to threats; Hope to futures; Obedience to Duties; Repentance to Sins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But Conſcience looks to all.</p>
               <p>A good Conſcience will ſtand a Man inſtead when he appears before the great Tribunal of God, where Courage dares not ſhew it's Face; nor Eloquence open it's Mouth; nor Majeſty hath any reſpect; nor Greatneſs hath any favour; where Money bears no Maſtery (as that Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:133614:18"/>
ſaid) To be feaſted with the Fruits of a good Conſcience is Angels food, and ſome of the Sweet-meats of Heaven, as a tormenting Conſcience is one of the greateſt miſeries of Hell.</p>
               <p>No man can attain to a good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but by a careful and diligent keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Heart, ſaith <hi>Bernard.</hi> A good Conſcience hath ever one Eye upon God, to obſerve his Precepts, and the other up to God, by Prayer to begg his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and Aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>Every man would willingly live and dye Comfortably. No way ſo to do but by laying up a Foundation of Comfort in an holy Converſation: A wicked Man would gladly forget himſelf, and run away from himſelf: He cannot look backward, or inward to himſelf, without guilt and Horror: It was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore good Counſel of an old <hi>Rabbi, Ne ſis impius coram te ipſo:</hi> Be not wicked in thine own ſight: Learn to reverence thy Conſcience. No ſuch good Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as a good Conſcience: A man may then dare to be acquainted with himſelf, as ſome men have written the Hiſtory of their own Lives. A Leper cares not much for a Looking-Glaſs, becauſe he ſhall ſee
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:133614:19"/>
by it nothing but his own Deformity. A Bank-rupt cannot abide to caſt up his account, becauſe he ſhall find himſelf worſe than nothing: But he that leads a holy Life is like to a man who hath Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled over a beautiful Valley, and being on the top of the Hill, turns about with delight to take a View of it again.</p>
               <p>A good Conſcience will be a <hi>Noah</hi>'s Ark to ſave us from periſhing with the World: A <hi>Zoar</hi> to ſhelter us from Wrath to come. It will be a <hi>Simon</hi> to help us to bear our Croſſes. His <hi>Mot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> is, <hi>Miſer ſit qui miſer eſſe poteſt:</hi> Let who will be miſerable, he cannot.</p>
               <p>To get, and keep a good Conſcience, we muſt diſlodg two home-bred Inn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Carnal delights. Reſt not in theſe; in Wealth; in Men: Rely not on Wines, Meats, Muſick, Pleaſures, Company &amp;c. Theſe will deceive in times of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs. Beſides, Nature ſoon putrifies and turns to Corruption, and ſo proves baneful.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Take heed of ſinful Luſts: Theſe <hi>War againſt the Peace and Comfort of the Soul,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 12. Yea, they are ſo far from Comforting that they oppreſs.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:133614:19"/>
                  <hi>The end of ſuch Mirth is heavineſs</hi> of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, Sorrow, Fear, Anguiſh, Tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Woe upon every Soul, that wallow's in ſuch ſenſual Sins. Conceive therefore of Sin (yea of every Sin) as of a Diſeaſe, a Wound, an Enemy to Peace, and Complain and ſtrive againſt it. Still walk in the Light, and keep thy ſelf in God's preſence, ſo Peace ſhall be upon thee, and thy Spirit ſhall be held up in cheerfulneſs.</p>
               <p>Oh the power of Conſcience! As it makes an happy Eſtate miſerable if bad: So a miſerable Condition bleſſed if Good. As will fully appear in this rare Example.</p>

                  <hi>Anno Chriſti,</hi> 1555.

               <p>THe <hi>Emblem</hi> of Charity is a naked Child giving Honey to a Bee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wings. Naked becauſe excuſeleſs and ſimple; a Child, becauſe tender and growing: Giving Honey, becauſe Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is pleaſant and Comfortable: To a Bee, becauſe a Bee is Painful and deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving: Without wings, becauſe helpleſs and wanting. If thou denieſt unto ſuch thou killeſt a Bee: If thou giveſt to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than ſuch, thou preſerveſt a Drone.</p>
               <p>Not to give to the Poor is to take from him: Not to feed the Hungry, if thou haſt it, is to the utmoſt of thy Power to kill him. That therefore thou may'ſt avoid both Sacriledg and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, be Charitable.</p>
               <p>Be not too cautious in diſcerning the fit Objects of thy Charity, leſt a Perſon periſh through thy diſcretion. What thou giveſt to miſtaken want, ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn a Bleſſing to thy deceived Heart. 'Tis better in relieving idleneſs to commit an accidental Evil, than in neglecting mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:133614:21"/>
to omit an Eſſential good. Better two Drones be preſerved, than one Bee periſh.</p>
               <p>God takes particular notice; and books down every Act and work of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that is done to his People, even to a little <hi>Cake of Bread,</hi> 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 17. 30.

                  <hi>Chriſt</hi> comes in his Fleſh to you, when Poor Chriſtians come to you: He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents a pale Face, a thin Cheek: He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents a bare Arm or Leg to you. Will you not do ſomething to ſupport <hi>Chriſt?</hi> And to cloth <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his Members? Shall the Bones of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſtare, and ſtand out?

               <p>God lays his ſolemn Charge upon us to be <hi>Rich in good Works.</hi> Now if God ſhould charge the Rocks, they would ſend forth Water: If the ſtones, they would become Bread: If the Ravens, they would feed <hi>Elias:</hi> If the <hi>Quails,</hi> they would victual the Camp: If the Clouds, they would Rain down food for his poor People.

               <p>Riches are a meer uncertainty, an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity, a fallacy. One while they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear;
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:133614:25"/>
another while they diſappear, as <hi>Meteors</hi> in the Air; As Dive-dappers in the Water: As a Flock of Birds in a Man's field, which he cannot call his own becauſe they ſit there; For they betake them to their Wings and fly away. Therefore we ſhould take care; Firſt, To keep them ſo long as we can: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly: To uſe them ſo well as we can: But neither can we aſſure Riches, nor uſe them better, than by beſtowing them on the Poor.</p>
               <p>Many miſerly Muck-worms are like to the Muck-hill, that never doth good till it be carried out. Like the fat Hog that is good for nothing till he comes to the Knife. Like the poor mans Box, that yields no Money till it be broken. Like to Trees that let fall none of their Fruit till they be violently ſhaken.</p>
               <p>'Tis fabled of <hi>Midas,</hi> that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he touched was turned into Gold: Sure it is that whatſoever the hand of Charity touches, tho it be but a Cup of cold Water, it turneth it, not into Gold, but into Heaven.</p>
               <p>But Charity is now ſo fled, that <hi>Elias</hi> wants his Hoſteſs of <hi>Sarepta: Eliſha</hi> the <hi>Sunamite:</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> cannot find the <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puriſs:</hi>

               <p>Of Mouth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>mercy indeed there is good ſtore, as there was in St. <hi>Jame</hi>'s his days: <hi>Go and be warmed fed, Clothed:</hi> But with what?

covered with a Cloud: Alms muſt be given privately. Charity held a bloody Heart in her right Hand: A good man is merciful; he firſt pittieth, and then relieveth. Charity offered Honey to a Bee without Wings: that is, Helps ſuch as would, but cannot help themſelves.</p>
               <p>Unworthy we are doubtleſs of ſuch an Honour, as to relieve hungry, thirſty, naked <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his poor Members.

               <p>Men Sow cheerfully upon good ground, and account their Seed better in the Ground than in the Garner. And is not Mercy as ſure a Grain as Vanity?

               </p>
               <p>Of <hi>Cyrus</hi> it's ſaid, that he took more delight and content in giving, than in receiving,</p>
               <p>It was a greater trouble to <hi>Severus</hi> the Emperor to be asked nothing than to give much.

               <p>God's mercy to us ſhould be a ſtrong Argument to provoke us to ſhew mercy to our Brethren. His was to Enemies,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:133614:29"/>
ours is to Brethren: His to Debtors, ours to Fellow-Servants: His of Free-grace to me, mine a juſt Debt to a Brother, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 8. His for ever to me, mine but for a moment to my Brother: His in Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents to me, mine but in Pence to my Brother: His in Blood to me, mine but in Bread to my Brother: His mercy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riches me, mine leaves my Brother poor ſtill. If I then live by the mercy that I do enjoy, and muſt be ſaved by the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that I do expect, ſhall ſo much mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ſhine on me, and none reflect from me upon my poor Brother? Shall all the Waters of Life run from <hi>Chriſt</hi> unto me, as thoſe of <hi>Jordan</hi> into a <hi>dead Sea,</hi> to be loſt and buried there? Wherefore doth the Sun ſhine, and the Rain fall upon the Earth, but that it may be Fruitful? <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the Fountain, Rich men the Conduit, and Poor men the Veſſels, which are there and thence ſupplied.</p>
               <p>God <hi>gives us all things Richly:</hi> The Earth empties into our Coffers her Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and her Gold: The Paſtures ſend us in Cattel: The Fields Corn: The Sea Fiſh: The Air Fowl: One Country ſends us in Wine: Another Spices: One Silk, and another Furs: One Delicates,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:133614:30"/>
and another Ornaments. God gives us the light of the Sun; the influences of the Stars; The protection of Angels; The righteouſneſs of his Son; The Graces of his Spirit, and the hope of his Glory; Yea, himſelf and the All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency of his power for our Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſhall not all this move us to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate his Example, in being Rich in good Works? If we do not give, we ſhall not live. If we do not do good, we ſhall not receive good. If we do not lay out, we ſhall not lay up. If we keep our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, we ſhall periſh with our Money. If we return it unto Heaven, we ſhall be gainers by it.</p>
               <p>Wares laid up in a low moiſt Room, will Rot and corrupt: but thoſe that be laid up in high Lofts will be kept ſound and ſafe: So if we lay up our Treaſures only in this World, they will periſh and come to nothing; but thoſe which (by Charity) we Treaſure up in Heaven, will be ever ſure and ſafe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 20.</p>

               <p>COncerning a good Woman under great Temptations and ſpiritual Deſertion, that could find no Comfort after all means uſed for the obtaining of it, he would often ſay; that the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence was not great, whether Comfort came at Death or an hour after, ſince Comfort would come aſſuredly.</p>
               <p>In his laſt Sickneſs being deſired to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of Company, he ſaid: I am alone in Company: 'Tis all one to me to be left alone, or to have Friends with me. My work is now to arm my ſelf for Death which aſſaults me, and I apply my ſelf (as I am able) for that great encounter.</p>
               <p>To all that came about him his fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Counſel was, that above all things they ſhould get Faith: For (ſaid he) 'Tis your Victory, your Peace, your Life, your Crown, and your chief piece of ſpiritual Armour: Howbeit, get on all the other Pieces, and then go forth in the Lord's might, ſtand to the Fight, and the iſſue ſhall be glorious: Only forget not to
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:133614:31"/>
call in the help of your General: Do all from him and under him.</p>
               <p>Being asked where his Comfort lay? He anſwered; in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and in the free Grace of God.</p>
               <p>Some telling him that he might have much Comfort in his Labours, &amp;c. He replied; all is nothing without a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, without him my beſt Works would condemn me. Oh! I am aſhamed of them, being mixed with ſo much Sin. Oh! I am an unprofitable Servant; I have not done any thing for God as I ought: Loſs of time ſits heavy upon my Spirit. Work, work apace: Aſſure your ſelf that nothing will more trouble you when you come to dye, than that you have done no more for God, who hath done ſo much for you.</p>
               <p>Sometimes he uſed thus to breath out himſelf, I never in all my Life ſaw the worth of <hi>a Chriſt</hi> nor taſted the ſweetneſs of God's love in that meaſure as now I do.</p>
               <p>When he was asked, what ſhould be done for him? his Anſwer was: Do not only pray for me, but praiſe God for his unſpeakable mercy to me; and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, that he hath kept off Satan from me in this day of my Weakneſs. Oh!
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:133614:32"/>
how good is God! Entertain good thoughts of him. However it be with us, we cannot think too well of him, nor too bad of our ſelves.</p>
               <p>A reverend Doctor being to pray with him, asked him, what he would have chiefly remembred? He anſwered: I praiſe God, he ſupports me, and keeps off Satan from me: Beg that I may hold out: I am now in a good way home, even quite ſpent. I am now at the Shore: I leave you toſſing on the Sea. Oh! It's a good time to Dye in.</p>
               <p>Another time being asked how he did? He anſwered: In no great pain (I praiſe God) only aweary of mine unuſeful Life. If God hath no more Service for me to do here, I could be gladly in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, where I ſhall ſerve him better; free from Sins and Diſtractions. I paſs from one Death to another, yet I fear none. I praiſe God I can Live, and I dare Dye. If God hath more Work for me to do here, I am willing to do it, tho my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm Body be very weary.</p>
               <p>Being asked whether Sickneſs, Pain &amp;c. cauſed him to deſire Death? he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, no: But I now do no good, and I hinder others which might be better
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:133614:32"/>
imployed, if I were gone. Why ſhould any deſire to Live but to do God ſervice? Now I ceaſe from that, I do not Live.</p>
               <p>His uſual ſaying was, that he valued no man for his Gifts, but for Humility under them. Neither ſhould he expect much from any man, were his Parts ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo great, till he was broken with Afflictions, and Temptations.</p>
               <p>His Obſervation was, that the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt Preachers converted moſt Souls, not the choiceſt Schollars whilſt unbro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
               <p>He ſometimes ſaid, that it's better to be an Humble Devil than a proud Angel: Which tho a ſeeming Contradiction, yet hath it much Truth in it.</p>
               <p>He often ſaid, that he had rather pour Liquor into his Boots than into his Mouth between Meals.</p>
               <p>The Rule, which he gave to his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren was this: When you are Youths chuſe your own Callings, when you are Men chuſe your own Wives, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take me along with you: It may be an Old man may ſee further than you.</p>

               <p>His counſel to young Preachers was, that they ſhould rather Preach one Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ten times over, than to ſpeak any thing new without Preparation.</p>
               <p>Concerning himſelf he ſaid, that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver came off with leſs Comfort, and worſe Content to himſelf, than when he was in appearance beſt provided. And he gave this reaſon for it, Not becauſe he had uſed ſuch diligence in preparing (for that was his Duty) but becauſe he was then apteſt to depend upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and to neglect his dependance upon God.</p>
               <p>Of the antient Fathers his ſaying was, that unleſs it were for their Polemical, and Hiſtorical parts, their Writings were more for Devotion and Affection, than for their judgment and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Concerning the Times wherein he lived, ſome things lay ſadly upon his Spirit. As</p>
               <p n="1">1. He complained that the Power of Godlineſs, and Exerciſe of Love, and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:133614:34"/>
Self-denial were much abated in theſe latter Days: And he much bewailed the vaſt difference both in Garb, and Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, between New and Old Profeſſors.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Indulgence which was ſhewed to tender Conſciences, was much abuſed to Profaneneſs, whilſt men of no Conſcience moſt pleaded that Liberty of chooſing their own Churches and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, when indeed, on the Matter, they abandoned all.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That Liberty of prophecying which ſome pretended to, was abuſed to meer Licentiouſneſs and Confuſion, whilſt ſome would have none, and others all Prophets and Preachers.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That in the Univerſities few could be called conſtant Students in thoſe times, but the moſt made a ſhort work of it, and Poſted into the Pulpit before they underſtood their Grounds; So that few were able to encounter with the grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Errors of thoſe times.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That in the Church, men were in their extreams, ſome preſſing nothing but the Law, others Preaching nothing but the Goſpel and <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. He complained of the want of <hi>Catechizing,</hi> and inſtructing Youth in
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:133614:35"/>
the Principles of Religion, the want of which, he ſaw by experience, was a great occaſion of the Peoples giddineſs.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But moſt of all he bewailed the readineſs of many to ſide, and to make Diviſions: And himſelf loved not, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to uſe, or to hear uſed dividing <hi>Names</hi> and <hi>Titles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He obſerved that ſuch as often chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Principles, and Faith profeſſed, uſually fell from <hi>Scepticiſm</hi> to <hi>Atheiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That ſo much Humility any man had, ſo much Grace and worth he had, and no more.</p>
               <p>That nothing was to be accounted good in or to any man, but that which was his proper Fruit and done by vertue of his Calling, from a Principle of God and for God.</p>
               <p>That the beſt man hath no ſecurity from any one Sin or fall, or Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, any further, or longer than he is held up by God's hand and <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</p>
               <p>That God doth oftentimes leave us to own Satan's ſuggeſtions for our own, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we do not own God in his holy Motions and breathings.</p>
               <p>That it's juſt with God to deny us the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:133614:35"/>
Comfort of our Graces, when we deny him the Glory of them.</p>
               <p>In himſelf he obſerved, that what he forgot in the Week-days, would unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably preſs in on the <hi>Lord's Day,</hi> ſo that he could (if he durſt) contrive more Worldly buſineſſes upon the <hi>Lord's Day,</hi> than he could diſpatch all the week after.</p>
               <p>That he found no greater Enemy than Diſcouragement; which he called, <hi>the Child of Pride and unbelief.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He uſed to ſay, that ſome Duties which were oft in mens Mouths as eaſy, he found very difficult to him. As</p>
               <p n="1">1. To deny himſelf in all his Selfs, was a Work to be learning whilſt he lived.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To live only by Faith and a bare Promiſe, without a Pawn, is a great work.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To give all to Free-Grace, and to <hi>Chriſt</hi> alone, is a mighty Work.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To love where we meet with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovingneſs and Contempt is no eaſie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To do ones proper Work with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome preſent Pay and Countenance from God and Man, is a hard Task.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That it's a far harder work to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopt

other mens<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Comforts, than their Sorrows, and to hold ones ſelf exalted in anothers Exaltation.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That to dye in cold Blood, and to be active in it as an act of Obedience, is the work of a Chriſtian indeed.</p>

                  <p>It's a hard thing to think ill of our ſelves, and well of God at the ſame time.</p>
                  <p>It's a hard thing for a Child of God to forgive himſelf ſome Faults, even when God hath forgiven them.</p>
                  <p>It's hard to retain holy Thoughts long, and to confine them to another Man's Prayers.</p>

                  <p>His advice to his Wife was, that if ſhe married again, ſhe ſhould remember her own Obſervation, which was this; that ſecond Husbands are uſually very Uxori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and ſecond Wives very prevalent: Therefore (ſaid he) take heed that you do no ill Offices by eſtranging your Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band from his former Children, or Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.

(ſaid the King;) becauſe thou haſt ſent the Prince into <hi>Spain</hi> from whence he is never like to return. But (ſaid the King) what wilt thou ſay, when thou ſeeſt him return back again? Marry (ſaid he) I will take off the Fools Cap, which I now put upon thy Head for ſending him thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and put it upon the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Head, for letting him return.</p>
               <p>Sr. <hi>Thomas Wiat</hi> told King <hi>Henry</hi> 8<hi>th,</hi> that he found out a Living of an Hundred pounds in the year, more than enough, and pray'd him to beſtow it upon him:
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:133614:50"/>
Why? (ſaid the King) we have none ſuch in <hi>England.</hi> Yes (ſaid Sr. <hi>Thomas)</hi> the Provoſt-ſhip of <hi>Eaton,</hi> where a Man hath his Dyet, his Lodging, his Horſe-meat, his Servants Wages, his Riding-charges, and a 100 Pound <hi>Per annum</hi> beſides.</p>
               <p>Sr. <hi>Thomas Wiat</hi>'s Jeſts were always confined to theſe Rules.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He never played upon a Man's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs, or Deformity: It being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane ſo to do.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Nor upon his Superiors, which is Sawcineſs, and undutifulneſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nor on ſerious, or holy Matters: For that's irreligious, and profane: Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying upon this occaſion that of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians,</hi> who would not ſuffer <hi>Pathus</hi> to play his <hi>Comedies,</hi> where <hi>Euripides</hi> repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his <hi>Tragedies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. He had much Salt but no Gall: Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten jeſting, but never jeering.</p>
               <p n="5">5. He obſerved Times, Perſons, and Circumſtances: knowing when to ſpeak, and when to hold his Peace too.</p>
               <p n="6">6. His apt, and handſome Reparties were rather natural than affected: Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, and acute; Prompt and eaſie, yet not Careleſs: Never rendring himſelf Contemptible to pleaſe others.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:133614:51"/>
7. His gift was not an inſipid chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Words, but a ſmart retort of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which every Body was better pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with than himſelf.</p>
               <p>What is Prerogative but a great Name, when not exerciſed over a free People? And what is Priviledge but a fond imagination, when not ſecured under a a powerful King, that may keep us from being Slaves one to another by an <hi>Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi> while we ſtrive to be free from his Tyranny.</p>
               <p>We ſhould not complain that we have little time, but that we ſpend much, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in doing nothing, or in doing Evil, or in doing nothing to the Purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Three things (ſaid a Wiſe man) will ſettle a State. Good God-Fathers, and God-Mothers performing their Vows. Good Houſholders over-looking their Families: And good School-Maſters e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducating Youth. This laſt is the moſt uſeful, tho the moſt Contemptible Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</p>
               <p>Reward (ſaid the ſame Perſon when he was offered a ſum of Money) ſhould not empty the King's Coffers; neither ſhould Riches be the pay of worth, which are meerly the Wages of Labour. He
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:133614:51"/>
that gives it, embaſeth a Man; He that takes it, vilifies himſelf: Who is ſo moſt rewarded, is leaſt.</p>
               <p>Secretary <hi>Walſingham</hi> would ſay: <hi>Stay a little and we ſhall have done the ſooner.</hi> Secretary <hi>Cecil</hi> would ſay: <hi>It ſhall never be ſaid of me, that I will defer till to Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row what I can do to day.</hi> Sr. <hi>Richard Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon</hi> would ſay: <hi>Give me this day, and take the next your ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He that knoweth to ſpeak well, knoweth alſo where he muſt hold his Peace, ſaid the Old <hi>Grecian. Think an Hour before you ſpeak, and a Day before you Promiſe,</hi> ſaid one of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Sages.</p>
               <p>The two main Principles which Guide humane Nature (ſaid Judg <hi>Dodderidg)</hi> are Conſcience and Law: By the former we are obliged in reference to another World, by the latter in Relation to this.</p>
               <p>When the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Fitz-James</hi> came upon the Bench, he knew no more than <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> or <hi>Levi,</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor Mother, neither Friend, nor Intereſt. For when a Couſin of his urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a kindneſs; <hi>Come to my Houſe</hi> (ſaid the Judg) <hi>and I will deny you nothing; Come to the King's Court, and I muſt do you Juſtice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:133614:52"/>
                  <hi>Plato</hi> ſaid, That a Man's mind is the Chariot, Reaſon the Coach-man, Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the Horſes, deſire of Honour the Whips, both exciting to go forward, and awing to be exact: Honour, always keeping up curiouſly the Honoured Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in an heigth of Action, that keeps an even Pace with admiration: Evenneſs, and Conſtancy being the Crown of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Gray</hi> was the firſt that brought a Coach into <hi>England:</hi> And <hi>Henry Fitz-Alan,</hi> Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> when he was Steward at King <hi>Edward</hi> the 6<hi>th</hi>'s Coronation, was the firſt that rid in a Coach in <hi>England.</hi>

                  </hi> was Servant to King <hi>Henry</hi> the 7<hi>th,</hi> and for Thirty years together Treaſurer to King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8<hi>th,</hi> King <hi>Edward</hi> the 6<hi>th,</hi> Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> Thus he ſerved divers Soveraigns in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mutable Times, being (as he ſaid of himſelf:) <hi>no Oak, but an Oſier.</hi> He had the rare happineſs of ſetting in his full Splendour, having lived ninety ſeaven years, and ſeen a Hundred and three that deſcended out of his Body.</p>
               <p>Sr. <hi>Henry Sidney</hi>'s Motto was, <hi>I will</hi>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:133614:52"/>

               <p>Princes are ordinarily the Rules of their Subjects actions; And are as the <hi>Primum Mobile</hi> to all their Motions.

               <p>Humble Virtues are as commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as aſpiring and Tumultuous Honour, and to raign in Peace with Juſtice, is as Glorious as to Conquer triumphantly in War.

               <p>The Oblivion of injuries is an Act e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very way more noble than Revenge.</p>

Anger is a Leproſie breaking out of a burning, as <hi>Levit.</hi> 13. 5. It renders a man unfit for all Civil Society. A man's unruly Paſſions make him like unto the <hi>torrid Zone,</hi> too hot for any to live neer him. The <hi>Dog-days</hi> continue with him all the year long, and he is fit only to live alone, as Dragons and wild Beaſts do.</p>
               <p>Weakneſs diſpoſes a man to Anger, becauſe ſuch men are moſt tender to feel an injury, moſt ſuſpitious to fear it, and moſt interpreting to over-judg it: All which being Circumſtances of aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to encreaſe a wrong, are likewiſe means to add degrees and heat unto our Paſſions.</p>
               <p>Anger begins in Raſhneſs; abounds in Tranſgreſſion, and ends in Repentance.</p>
               <p>Anger (ſaith <hi>Seneca)</hi> is the fouleſt, fierceſt, and maddeſt affection of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. The angry Perſon diſcovers it by his Words, by his Looks, by his Actions.

The looks of an angry man are
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:133614:73"/>
ſometimes furiouſly red, and ſometimes gaſtly Pale. His Lips tremble; His Teeth grin; His Hair ſtare; He ſwells like a Toad; He glows like a Devil, &amp;c. So that for the time that it Continues, it is the fouleſt, and maddeſt of the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; As we ſee in <hi>Achitophel,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enraged that his Counſel was reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, went home and hanged himſelf.</p>
