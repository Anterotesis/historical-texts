            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>That by the Statute of <hi>Mag. Charta,</hi> it is enacted, <hi>That no freeman ought to be impriſoned &amp;c.

thence proroged to the 24 <hi>of February next following, and from thence continued</hi> till the 24 <hi>of Iune</hi> Car. <hi>he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent as one of the Peers of the Realm of Ireland.</hi> And further ſaith, that on the 23 <hi>of October</hi> 17 Car. he was taken and arreſted by certain Perſons to him unknown at <hi>Dublin</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and there committed to ſafe Cuſtody for the <hi>Treaſons pretended to be committed</hi> by him, till afterwards he was on <hi>the 12 of Iune 18 Car.</hi> by certain Perſons to him unknown, brought in ſafe Cuſtody, againſt his Will, to <hi>Westminſter within the Realm of England,</hi> and then and there committed to the <hi>Tower of London,</hi> where he is yet detained. And therefore prayeth, that he <hi>may be tryed and judged by his Peers of the Realm of Ireland for the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Treaſons in the Indictment.</hi> To this plea of his, Mr. <hi>Aske</hi> the Kings Attorney in this Court hath <hi>demurred in Law,</hi> and the Priſoner hath joyned in <hi>demurrer:</hi> And whether <hi>this Plea</hi> of the Priſoner as <hi>to his tryall by his Peers of the Realm of Ireland, be good in Law?</hi> is the ſole queſtion to be now argued.</p>
            <p>This Caſe is of very great concernment, and yet of greater expectation: It concerns the whole <hi>Peerage of Ireland</hi> in ſome reſpects, on the one hand; and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the <hi>Iuſtice</hi> both of the <hi>King, Parliament</hi> and <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> in bringing a deſperate <hi>Rebell</hi> and <hi>Arch-Traytor</hi> to <hi>condigne puniſhment,</hi> for the moſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid, bloody <hi>Treaſon</hi> againſt the <hi>Kings Royal Crown</hi> and <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> the Proteſtant <hi>Religion,</hi> and the whole <hi>Engliſh Nation inhabiting Ireland</hi> (devoted to deſtruction by this Traytor and his Confederates) that ever was plotted or executed under the Sun.

I wiſh my vacancy to ſtudy and abilitie to argue this <hi>publique Cauſe,</hi> had been ſuch as might have ſatisfied expectation, and diſcharged

the truſt repoſed in me; but other <hi>publique ſervices</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving much interrupted me therein, I ſhall begin to argue it for the preſent with the beſt skill I may, and ſo leave it to thoſe learned Gentlemen of the Law (if there ſhall be need of any further Arguments) who are provided to argue after me, to ſupply what is defective in this my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emiall Argument.</p>
            <p>All matters of fact and <hi>form</hi> ariſing in this <hi>Plea,</hi> have<note place="margin">What not in queſtion.</note> been already admitted true, and ſufficiently pleaded in Law by mutual conſent, and nothing but the meer mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Law reſts now to be debated, which I conceive to be but one ſhort ſingle point.</p>
            <p>For though the Priſoner pleads, <hi>that there was a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of which he was a Peer and Member, continuing in Ireland by prorogation at the time of his apprehenſion and ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over into England;</hi> Yet this <hi>Privilege of Parliament,</hi> comes no wayes in queſtion as to the point of his triall, now only in iſſue (as hath been falſly ſuggeſted to the <hi>Lords houſe</hi> and intimated in an <hi>Ordinance</hi> of theirs ſince revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,) but relates only to his firſt apprehenſion, which is not here in controverſie' Beſides, he pleads not, that <hi>this Parliament is yet continuing and actually ſitting in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, of which he ought to have</hi>

               <hi>the privilege;</hi> but that it was continued till the 24 of <hi>Iune</hi> 17 <hi>Car.</hi> which is 3 years ſince, and ſo intended to be long ſince ended: Nor pleads he, that he ought to be, or to have been tryed for this Treaſon in <hi>the Parliament of Ireland,</hi> nor that his <hi>privilege of Parliament ought to extend to ſecure him from any apprehenſion or</hi> Indictment <hi>for high Treaſou,</hi> (when the Treaſon is viſible and reall, as his is, and not imaginary only, in which Caſe <hi>of Treaſon no privilege of Parliament is to be admitted, as hath been reſolved</hi> 8 <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>rot.

               </gap>ſuing reaſons.</p>
            <p>1. From the generallity and univerſality of the Act it ſelf, wherein I ſhall obſerve a four-fold univerſality, which ſupplies me with four undenyable arguments, to prove <hi>Iriſh Peers,</hi> within this Law, as well as <hi>Iriſh Commoners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt, is a <hi>univerſality of the Kinds of offences</hi> ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Act, in theſe general Terms; <hi>All manner of offences <hi>being already mad: or declared, or here after to be made or declared by any the Laws or Statutes of this Realm, to be Treaſons, miſpriſiion of Treaſons, or concealment of Treaſons, done or perpetrated out of this Realm of</hi>
               </hi> England, <hi>ſhall be enquired of by the Kings Iuſtices of his Bench &amp;c.</hi> Now theſe general words <hi>All manner of offences, &amp;c.</hi> muſt neceſſarily extend to all manner of <hi>Treaſons</hi> perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated or committed out of this Realm by <hi>Peers</hi> as well ar Commoners; To the Treaſons of the Lord <hi>Magwire,</hi> as well as to the Treaſons of <hi>Mac Mahone</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr>, they being the ſelfſame Treaſons in ſubſtance, and a manner of <hi>Treaſons ſpecially made and declared by the Laws of this
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:115516:16"/>
Realm,</hi> ſince there are no reſtrictive words to confine theſe general clauſes of Treaſons only to Commoners, and no expreſſe exception for the offences or Treaſons of Iriſh Peers to be found within the Statute; elſe there would be a repugnance and contradiction between the text and the Glo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e, and this general ſhould be turned into a ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal in reſpect of the Traitors offending. Therefore this general clauſe extending to all Treaſons whatſoever done or perpetrated out of the Realm, muſt neceſſarily extend to the Treaſons of all Iriſh Peers as well as Commons, and ſo both of them by the words and intention of this Law ſhall be triable in this Court.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is, <hi>a univerſality of time. All manner of offences already made or declared, or hereafter to be made or declared Treaſon &amp;c. done perpetrated or committed, or <hi>here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to be done, perpetrated or committed,</hi> ſhall be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of by the Kings Iustices of the Bench, &amp;c.</hi> which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to all former Treaſons done out of the Realm at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time before the making, and to all future Treaſons ſince the paſſing of this Act: Now this univerſality of time extends as well to the Treaſons of Iriſh Peers as Commoners, to the Treaſons of Baron <hi>Magwire</hi> as well as of Mr. <hi>Mac-Mahone,</hi> both being alike Treaſons commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted after this Act.</p>
            <p>The 3d. is. a <note n="*" place="margin">See Cooks 3 Inſtit. p. 34.</note> 
               <hi>univerſality of place, All manner of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons done, perpetrated or committed <hi>out of this Realm of England:</hi>
               </hi> that is, <hi>in any place whatſoever out of the Realm of</hi> England, be it in <hi>Ireland, Scotland, France, Spain, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, Italie, Barbary, Turkie,</hi> the <hi>East</hi> or <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> as was reſolved in <hi>Dr. Stories caſe,</hi> Hil. 13 Eliz.

            <p>The 4th. (which is fatal and unanſwerable) is <hi>a <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality of Perſons,</hi> coupled together with all the 3 former generalities in theſe expreſſe words. <hi>All manner of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences</hi>

                  </gap> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Kings Iuſtices of his Bench, &amp;c.</hi> Now <hi>any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or Perſons,</hi> being a univerſal expreſſion, equivalent <hi>to all manner of Perſons whatſoever, Collectively:</hi> or, <hi>to all and euery Perſon whatſoever, diſtributively,</hi> extends to Iriſh <hi>Peers</hi> as well as <hi>Commoners,</hi> yea to all Subjects of all Ranks whatſoever, within the compaſſe of this Law in regard of the manner of Tryal, but ſuch only who are excepted out of it by <hi>ſpecial Proviſo.</hi> Now Iriſh Peers are none of thoſe Perſons excepted, as I ſhall prove anon.</p>
            <p>That theſe words <hi>any perſon or perſons,</hi> extend to Peers as well as Commoners, where there is no excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Peers, is undeniable.</p>
            <p>Firſt becauſe a Peer is a <hi>Perſon,</hi> though of a higher rank or degree than an ordinary Commoner or Freeman; and one kind of <hi>perſon</hi> in Law; therefore within theſe words <hi>any perſon or perſons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2ly. Becauſe general Laws made for the common good ſafety of the Realm, and puniſhment of the grand crime of High <hi>Treaſon,</hi> are like to Go himſelf, <note n="*" place="margin">Acts 10. 3, 4. Rom. 2. 11. Eph. 6. 9. Col. 3. 25. 1 Pet. 1. 17.</note> 
               <hi>No respectors of perſons,</hi> but bind and puniſh all alike. Therefore <hi>any perſon or perſons</hi> in ſuch a publick Law as this, made for the common good, ſafety, and puniſhment of the greateſt Treaſons, Evils, muſt neceſſarily include all perſons, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects whatſoever, and except none, eſpecially the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, whole examples and offences are commonly moſt dangerous and pernicious.</p>
            <p>Thirdly in all publick Acts whatſoever; Theſe words <hi>any perſon or perſons,</hi> extend to Peers as well as Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and I know no one Preſident to the contrary. To inſtance in ſome few Acts inſtead of many; In the Statutes of 26 H. 8. c. 13. &amp; 5, &amp; 6 E. 6. c. 11. concerning Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, <hi>any perſon or perſons;</hi> or any of the <hi>Kings Subjects, Denizen, or others, that ſhall commit or practiſe</hi> Treaſon <hi>out of the limits of this Realm, in any outward parts; extend to Peers as well as Commons.</hi> Therefore in this Act of

               <hi>many others</hi>) the words <hi>any perſon or perſons,</hi> extend to <hi>Peers</hi> as well as Commons, as is reſolved in the bodies and Proviſoes of all theſe Acts: Yea, in the Statute of 25 <hi>E. 3. c.</hi> 2. of <hi>Treaſons</hi> (though a moſt penal Law) the words are only; If <hi>a man do compaſs or imagine the deach of the King; If a man do levy war againſt the King in his</hi> Realm, &amp;c. <hi>If a man counterfeit the Kings Broad or Privy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeal, or his mony,</hi> &amp;c. Yet it hath been reſolved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſpute in all times, and ſo agreed by Sir <hi>Edward Cook, Inſtitutes</hi> 3. p. 4, 5. That this word a <hi>man,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to <hi>both ſexes alike, including women as well as men, Peers as well as Commoners, Lords, as well as</hi> Peſants. yea all ranks, callings, conditions of men who are Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: and that this word <hi>man</hi> in the ſingular number only, extends to <hi>many men</hi> to any number of men committing any of theſe Treaſons joyntly, as well as to a ſingle man or Traytor, becauſe it is a general Law, made for the ſafety of the Kings perſon, and the Realm. Much more then muſt any perſon or perſons, in this Statute, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both in the ſingular and plural number, and in common acceptation a far more univerſal, general, and comprehenſive expreſsion than this of <hi>a man,</hi> in 25 E. 3. c. 2. extend equally to all ſorts, ſects, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of men, as well as it, and ſo to Peers as much as
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:115516:18"/>
it, and to Peers as well as to Commons, as it doth in the Statutes of 25 H. 8. c. 22. 26 H. 8. c. 13. 27 H. 8. c. 2. 33 H. 8. c. 12. &amp; 20. 5 E. 6. c. 11. 1 Mar. c. 6. 1. &amp; 2 Phil. &amp; Mar. c. 9, to, 11. 5 Eliz. c. 1. 13 Eliz. c. 2. 18 Eliz. c. 1. 23 Eliz. c. 1. 27 Eliz. c. 2. 3 Jac. c. 4, concerning Treaſons.</p>
            <p>2ly. My ſecond Argument to prove <hi>Iriſh</hi> Peers with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this Statute, is, becauſe <hi>Iriſh-Commons</hi> are within its Verge even for Treaſons committed in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as hath been adjudged in the forecited caſes of <hi>Orourk, Sir John Parrot, and Mac-Mahone:</hi> For Laws and Law givers <hi>being no reſpectors of perſons,</hi> where the offences be the ſame, and there being no one clauſe, word, or ſyllable in this Statute extending to <hi>Iriſh</hi>-Commoners Treaſons, but which doth, may and ought by the ſelf ſame Juſtice, reaſon, equity to extend to the Treaſons of <hi>Iriſh</hi>-Peers, (this Statute making no diſtinction between the one and other, and the Commons of <hi>Ireland</hi> having as abſolute a right and Inheritance in their native Privilege of being tryed by their Peers in <hi>Ireland,</hi> (which yet is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by this Act in caſe of Treaſon) as the Peers in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> have in their Peerage to be tryed there by their <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh</hi>-Peers:) We muſt not, yea we cannot in point of Juſtice diſtinguiſh between the one and other, where the Law it ſelf makes no diſtinction: Therefore ſince the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Commoner is undoubtedly within the words and ſcope of this Act to be tryed at this Bar by a <hi>Middleſex</hi>-Jury, the <hi>Iriſh</hi>-Peer (unleſs we will judge with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of perſons, and coyn a diſtinction not warranted by this Act) muſt be alſo tryed in the ſelf-ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. The Law is the ſame, the crime is the ſame, both in <hi>Magwires</hi> and in <hi>Mac-Mahones</hi> caſes, therefore the Tryal and Judgement too muſt in law, reaſon be the ſame in both.</p>
            <p>3ly. It will be granted me without diſpute, That if an <hi>Iriſh-Peer</hi> commit Treaſon in any forein parts out of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> as in <hi>Spain, France, Flanders, Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> or <hi>Germany,</hi> he ſhall be tryed in this Court by an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:115516:18"/>
Jury if Free-holders, and not by his Peers in <hi>Ireland,</hi> by vertue of this Act. Nay, if he commit Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and flye into <hi>England;</hi> he may and ſhall be tryed for that very Treaſon by an ordinary Jury at this Bar, <note n="*" place="margin">See Cooks 3 Inſtit. p. 31.</note> becauſe by flying his Country, and a legal tryal there, he hath outed himſelf of the benefit of his Peers. Therefore it extends to <hi>Iriſh-Peers,</hi> even for Treaſons done in <hi>Ireland,</hi> elſe they could not be tryable here in any of theſe Caſes, which are granted on all hands to be Law.</p>
            <p>4ly. It is evident by the <hi>Proviſo</hi> in this Act, that <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Peers</hi> committing any manner of <hi>Treaſons out of this Realm, are tryable for it in England</hi> by vertue of this Law, as well as <hi>Engliſh Commons,</hi> though they were not ſo by the Common-law. Therefore <hi>Iriſh Peers</hi> commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Treaſon, ſhall be within it likewiſe, &amp; ſo tryable here as well as <hi>Iriſh</hi> Commons, elſe they ſhould be in far better condition than <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Scotiſh Peers,</hi> and quite exempted out of this Act. Now the ſame words that bring <hi>Engliſh-Peers</hi> within this Law, muſt of neceſsity hook in <hi>Iriſh-Peers</hi> too, there being no clauſe which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empts or includes the one more than the other.</p>
            <p>5ly. The very letter, intent, and ſcope of this Act (as appears by the body of it, and likewiſe by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of 26 H. 8. c. 13. &amp; 5, &amp; 6 E. 6. c. 11. to the ſame effect) was, <hi>to make all Treaſons done or commiteed out of</hi> England <hi>by any perſon or perſons whatſoever, tryable in</hi> England, <hi>either before the Juſtices in this Court, or</hi>

               <hi>before ſpecial Commiſsioners in ſome other Counties;</hi> but to be ſtill tryable <hi>within this Realm,</hi> as the words (<hi>All man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Treaſons hereafter to be done, perpetrated, or commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by any perſon or perſons out of the Realm of</hi> England, ſhall be <hi>from henceforth <hi>enquired of, head, and determined before the Kings Juſtices of his Bench &amp;c.</hi>
               </hi>) clearly reſolve in direct terms: Therefore to make the Treaſons of <hi>Iriſh-Peers</hi> committed in <hi>Ireland</hi> or elſewhere tryable here in <hi>England,</hi> as well as the Treaſons of <hi>Engliſh-Peers,</hi> or <hi>Iriſh-Commoners.</hi> And to ſend them back into <hi>Ireland</hi> to be

there tryed by their Peers, when once they are here in Priſon, and indicted in this Court, by exempting them out of this Act, contrary to the very letter and intent of the Law, is to run point-blank againſt the very words and meaning of this Law and the Law-makers: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he muſt by this Act be tryed at this Bar, and that by an ordinary Jury only, as I ſhall prove anon.</p>
            <p>6ly. The very ſcope and ſole purport of this Act is not to make new Treaſons or Traytors, which were none before, but to bring real Traytors only for Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons formerly made, or hereafter to be made and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Treaſons by the Laws and Statutes of this Realm, to exemplary puniſhment in this Kingdome, for the peace and preſervation of the King, Realm, and the better execution of Juſtice (the very life of Laws) upon Delinquents only of the higheſt rank, for the moſt tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent crimes of High <hi>Treaſons,</hi> of miſpriſion, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealments of Treaſons, not for Felonies, or petit Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: Which conſideration muſt neceſſarily induce us, for the common good, to give it the largeſt, fulleſt, and moſt equitable conſtraction that may be. Thus the Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in former times have always interpreted it, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by <hi>Dyer, f. 132, 298. Cookes 7.

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:115516:19"/>
Kings Bench by good and lawfull men of the ſame Shire, where the ſaid Bench ſhall ſit;</hi> and the Act ſpeaks nothing at all of ſtanding mute. But this being a publique Law for the Common good, to bring Traytors only to their Tryal and juſt puniſhment, his refuſal to put himſelf upon his Tryal, was adjudged to be a determination and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of his Treaſons within the Act, elſe any Traytor by ſtanding mute might evade and fruſtrate this good Law. If then this Statute may thus be conſtrued by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and dilated beyond the words to one who ſtands mute, for a Treaſon done in <hi>Ireland:</hi> much more may it be extended to a treaſon by an <hi>Iriſh</hi>-Peer, who is fully within the words and intent of it, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready manifeſted: And it would be a moſt pernicious gloſs which ſhould either elude or nullifie this benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial publique Law.</p>

Now
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:115516:21"/>
in this caſe here in judgement at the Bar, all theſe recited reaſons hold. For firſt, moſt of the <hi>Irish</hi> Peers were in actual Rebellion when the Priſoner was ſent over: moſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and Proteſtant <hi>Irish</hi> Peets there, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murthered or forced to flye thence, or ſo diſperſed and imployed, that they could not aſſemble a competent number of indifferent Peers to any place with conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency to try him in <hi>Ireland.</hi> 2ly. The enemies and <hi>Irish</hi> Rebels were then Maſters of the field in moſt places, the Priſoner in danger to be reſcued by force from them, or by treachery likely for to eſcape out of their hands; and the times ſo troubleſome, as would admit no lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure for ſuch a Tryal. 3ly. Moſt of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were-allyed to <hi>Magwire,</hi> or ingaged with him in the ſelf-ſame Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Rebellion; and ſo neither in Law, Juſtice, or Prudence fit or indifferent perſons to paſs upon his Tryal in this Caſe of moſt publick concernment. 4ly. The Judges, Witneſſes and Peers that ſhould try him there, would have been in extreme perill of their lives, and of exemplary publick revenges from their Confederate-Rebels, who threatned revenge, as appears by <hi>Mac-Mahons</hi> Speech (<hi>Magwires</hi> Confederate) to the Juſtices upon his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> and by like words of revenge uſed by <hi>Owen Oneile</hi> in <hi>Flanders</hi> ſo ſoon as he heard <hi>Magwire</hi> was apprehended. 5ly.

            <p>I ſhall now proceed to the laſt point, ariſing from the<note place="margin">Queſt. 3d.</note> manner of this Plea, that he may be tryed by his Peers, not expreſsing, where or how, and intimating that he would be ſo tryed here in <hi>England.</hi> It is briefly this. <hi>Admitting an</hi> Iriſh <hi>Peer to be tryable in</hi> England <hi>for a Treaſon committed by him in</hi> Ireland, <hi>whether this doth not inevitably out him of his Tryal by</hi> Iriſh <hi>Peers, and ſubj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>1.

The Priſoner then being no Peer in <hi>England,</hi> it is impoſsible that he ſhould be tryed in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> by his Peers.</p>
            <p>2ly. Becauſe no ſuch way of Tryal was ever yet heard of in any age, of any <hi>Iriſh</hi> or other forein Peer, tryed here in <hi>England,</hi> either by <hi>English</hi> Peers, or by his <hi>Irish</hi> or forein Peers; Therfore ſuch a Trial ſhall not nor can be had or admitted now,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:115516:22"/>3ly. Becauſe neither the Kings Bench, nor the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsioners before whom the Statute limits theſe forein Treaſons to be tryed, nor yet the High Steward of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> (if any ſuch ſhould be created) have any power or juriſdiction to ſummon a Jury of Peers out of <hi>Ireland</hi> to appear before them here in <hi>England</hi> upon ſuch a Tryal as this; neither are the Peers of <hi>Ireland</hi> bound by any Law to appear or attend as Peers on any ſuch ſervice or tryal here, being Peers, &amp; bound to ſervice as Peers (which their Patents expreſs) only in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and no Peers here. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Tryal by his <hi>Iriſh</hi> Peers here in <hi>England</hi> is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility, as well as illegality.</p>
            <p>4ly. Admit a Jury of Peers might be ſummoned and ſent from thence, yet it would be a great delay of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, it requiring a long time to procure a full appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Peers thence: yea, a betraying of <hi>Ireland</hi> to the Rebels at this inſtant, to ſend for ſo many Proteſtant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Peers now from thence as might ſerve to try him here. Moreover, it would be an infinite expence, charge, trouble, beſides the danger by Sea, to ſummon a Jury of Peers from thence; and if they failed to appear in <hi>England</hi> upon ſummons, as is probable they would, and lawfully might they being not bound to it by any Law and ſo no fine certain to be ſet upon them for not appearing, nor legal means of coercion to compell them to come over upon ſuch a Tryal, there ſhould be a fayler of Juſtice for want of ſuch a Peerage; And therefore no ſuch Tryal may or can be expected, which would delude and nul this Law.</p>
            <p>5ly. This Statute directs the Tryal of forein Treaſons in expreſs terms, to <hi>be before the Judges in the Kings Bench, or the Commiſsioners appointed by the King in any County of this Realm.</hi> Now no Tryal by <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Iriſh</hi> Peers was ever heatd of either in the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> or before ſuch <hi>Commiſsioners,</hi> But it alwaies hath been, and ought to be either in the houſe of <hi>Peers in Parliament;</hi> or <hi>before the Lord High Steward of</hi> England, as all former Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents accord, <hi>and 15, E. 3. c. 2. 1 H. 4. 1. 10 E.</hi> 4. 6.

for which the Priſoner ſtands indicted</hi> had been plotted and executed in <hi>Middleſex.</hi> Therefore to admit him to a Tryal by <hi>Iriſh Peers,</hi> and not by good and lawfull men of <hi>Middleſex;</hi> or to ſend the Priſoner back to <hi>Ireland</hi> there to be tryed by his Peers, is to run quite counter and pointblanck againſt this unanſwerable clauſe of the Statute, <hi>That he ſhall be tryed by good and lawfull men of the ſame Shire where the Kings Bench ſits, to all intents and purpoſes as if the Treaſons had been there committed.</hi> And had they been there committed actuallie, as they are le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gallie by the expreſs purview of this Law, it could never ſo much as be ſcrupled and made a <hi>quere;</hi> whether he ſhould be tryed by his <hi>Iriſh</hi> Peers here? or ſent over to be tryed in <hi>Ireland</hi> for Treaſons acted there, after an Endict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for them here found againſt him?

            <p>7ly. The Proviſo in this Act puts a period to this Caſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Provided always, that if any the Peers of this Realm shall happen to be endicted of any ſuch Treaſons or other offences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, by authority of this Act, that then after ſuch En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment, they shall have their Tryal by their Peers, in ſuch like manner as hath been heretofore accuſtomed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From whence I ſhall obſerve theſe five particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that Treaſons committed by <hi>English</hi> Peers in fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein parts, are tryable here in <hi>England,</hi> within the verie bodie and purview of this Law. Therefore by the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame reaſon, law, and juſtice, Treaſons committed out of this Realm in <hi>Ireland</hi> even by <hi>Irish</hi> Peers, are triable in <hi>England</hi> by this Act, elſe <hi>Irish</hi> Peers ſhould be quite
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:115516:24"/>
out of this Act, and in better condition than <hi>Engliſh</hi> or any <hi>Iriſh</hi> Commoners, who are clearly adjudged with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it.</p>
            <p>2ly. That Tryal by <hi>Peers,</hi> is ſaved by this Proviſo on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie <hi>to the Peers of this Realm,</hi> which both in the Prologue and body of this Act is expreſly ſtiled <hi>this Realm of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> But the Peers of <hi>Ireland</hi> are no <note n="*" place="margin">Seldens tit. of Hon. p. 837, 840, 841.</note> Peers at all of this Realm of <hi>England,</hi> as is reſolved in 11 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>Brief</hi> 473. 20 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>Co.</hi> 7 <hi>Rep. f.</hi> 15, 16. <hi>&amp; 9 Rep.</hi> Lord <hi>Sanchars</hi> caſe, <hi>f.</hi> 117. <hi>Co.</hi> 3 <hi>Inſtit. p.</hi> 30. and <hi>Dyer f. 360. b.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no waies within the compaſs, words, or reaſon of this Proviſo, but clearly ſecluded out of it, and ſo not tryable by their Peers. And this Statute preſcribing a new way of trial for forein Treaſons, not triable here by Peers before, had excluded all <hi>Engliſh</hi> Peers from trial by their Peers, by the bodie of the Law, as ſome conceive, had it not been ſaved to them by this ſpecial Proviſo: Therefore certainlie <hi>Irish</hi> Peers who are not provided for at all, and no Peers in <hi>England,</hi> muſt neceſſarilie be excluded from their Peerage by it upon their trial here.</p>
            <p>3ly. The reaſon why this Law doth ſave the tryal by Peers to Peers of this Realm onlie and to no others (which as ſome conceived was not ſaved to them in caſes of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein <hi>Treaſons</hi> by the Statute of 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 13. as appears by the Lord <hi>Grayes</hi> caſe hereafter cited makes an end of the Caſe in Queſtion, becauſe Peers of the Realm of <hi>England</hi> are Peers in everie ſhire and Countie of <hi>England.</hi> Therefore by the great Charter of <hi>England,</hi> and all other Acts confirming it, and the Common law it ſelf, they ought to be tried onlie by their Peers within all Counties and places of the Realm of <hi>England:</hi> But-<hi>Iriſh, Scotiſh,</hi> and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein Peers are no Peers in any Countie of <hi>England,</hi> as the forecited Books <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Now this Statute enacting, all forein Treaſons to be triable not in <hi>Ireland</hi> or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Majeſties Dominions, but in <hi>England</hi> only; it was neceſſarie and convenient by this ſpecial Proviſo to ſave the Trial by Peers to all <hi>Engliſh</hi> Peers to be tryed for forein treaſons only in <hi>England,</hi> according to <note n="*" place="margin">Cap. 29. See Cooks 2 inſt. p. 48, 49.</note>

But <hi>Iriſh</hi> and other Peers being no Peers at all in <hi>England,</hi> and it being a thing improper to trie them by <hi>Engliſh</hi> Peers being no real Peers to them, and a thing impoſsible to try them here by <hi>Iriſh</hi> or any other forein Peers, for the reaſons former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie alleged, and this Statute confining the trials within it only to <hi>England;</hi> it had been a direct contradiction and abſurditie to provide, that theſe forein Peers ſhould be tried here by their forein Peers for Treaſons, and not by an ordinarie Jury, becauſe they are neither Peers themſelves in <hi>England,</hi> nor others who ſhould come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from <hi>Ireland</hi> or other forein parts, who loſe their forein Peerage, as ſoon as they ſet foot on <hi>Engliſh</hi> ground, with relation unto <hi>England,</hi> where their Peerage pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentlie ceaſeth.</p>
            <p>4ly, <hi>The Statute is, That the trial for ſuch Treaſons, &amp;c. ſhall be in ſuch manner and form to all in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ents and purpoſes as if they had been committed in</hi> England. Now if <hi>Engliſh</hi> Peers commit Treaſon in <hi>England,</hi> they ſhall by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of <hi>Magua Charta, cap.</hi> 29, (yea by King <hi>Johns</hi> Charter, and by the Common law long before, as Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund Cook</hi> proves in his Commentary upon it; and I have at large demonſtrated in my <note n="*" place="margin">Page 202 to 307.</note>

Therefore the ground of ſaving trial by Peers, to Peers of <hi>England</hi> by this Act is, an unanſwerable argument to denie ſuch a trial here to any Peers of <hi>Ireland</hi> by <hi>Irish</hi> or <hi>English</hi> Peers.</p>
            <p>5ly. The laſt words of this Proviſo determine the caſe in queſtion without more diſpute; <hi>Provided al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, that if any Peers of this Realm happen to be indicted of any ſuch Treaſons aforeſaid by authority of this Act they shall have ſuch trial by their Peers, in ſuch like manner as hath <hi>bean heretofore accuſtomed.</hi>

            <p>5ly.

               <hi>Engliſh</hi> Statutes made in the ſelf-ſame Caſes; which provide, <hi>a Tryal by Peers for our English Peers;</hi> which was never heard of in any Acts of Parliament in <hi>Ireland</hi> till theſe, and never practiſed that I read of in that Realm, either before or ſince. To clear this up more fully, the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of 11 E. 3. c. 4. makes mention <hi>of Prelates, Earls, and Barons in Ireland,</hi> as well as in <hi>England:</hi> And the Statute of 4 H. 5. c. 6. prohibits, <hi>that any one of the Iriſh Nation should be choſen to be an Arch-Bishop, Abbot, or Prior within</hi> Ireland, <hi>becauſe many of them (againſt a former Act there made) had been made Arch-bishops, Bishops, Abbots, Priors, wherby they became Peers of the Parliament in the ſame Land, and brought with them</hi> Iriſh <hi>Servants to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Counſels there holden, whereby the privities of the</hi> Engliſhmen <hi>within the ſame Land have been and be daily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverd within it to the</hi> Irish <hi>people Rebels to the King, to the great perill and miſchief of the Kings lawfull liege people in the ſame Land.</hi> And the Statute of 10 H. 7. in Ireland c. 16. enacts, <hi>That the Spiritual and temporal Lords of the Land of</hi> Ireland, <hi>shall appear in every Parliament holden in that Land <hi>in their Parliament Robes,</hi> in like manner and form as the Lords of the Realm of</hi> England <hi>appear in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments holden within the ſaid Realm,</hi> under pain of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting 100 <hi>s. to the King: which uſe of Robes they had there for penury omitted by the ſpace of 20 or 24 years.</hi> But there is no mention of any <hi>Tryal</hi> by their <hi>Peers</hi> in theſe or any other <hi>English</hi> or <hi>Irish Statutes;</hi> but thoſe forecited of 2 Eliz. c. 1. &amp; 6.

               </hi> all <hi>other Statutes and Acts made by authority of Parliament in</hi> England, <hi>be ratified, confirmed, and adjudged by authority of this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their force and ſtrength, <hi>from the ſixth day of</hi>
               </hi> March.

Becauſe I would leave nothing concealed or unanſwered that might make for the priſoners advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, I muſt acknowledge, that King <hi>Henry</hi> the 3d. in the firſt year of his Reign ſent a Roll of the liberties which his Father King <hi>Iohn</hi> and he had granted to this Realm of <hi>England</hi> unto <hi>Ireland,</hi> out of his ſpecial grace, by unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous conſent of all his Lieges, and confirmed the ſame to all his Spiritual and Temporal Lords and faithfull Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects there (for their fidelity to him and his Father) to them and their Heirs for ever, as a ſignal bedge of his favour, by this patent. <note n="*" place="margin">Par. 1 H. 3. m. 3.</note>

No one preſident of any one Iriſh Peers trial by his Peers in <hi>Ireland</hi> in any caſe whatſoever, can be produced.

            <p>If then the Peers of <hi>Ireland</hi> before the making of this Act of 35 <hi>H.</hi> 8. were never actually tried by their Peers for any treaſon done in <hi>Ireland,</hi> for ought can be proved, and there be no expreſs Act for any trial by Peers there, for any Treaſon, but only the Act of 2 <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 1. and 6. and that only for ſpecial Treaſons within thoſe Laws, which are none of thoſe for which the Priſoner ſtands here indicted; I may ſafely conclude, That this Law of 35 <hi>H.</hi> 8. never intended to preſerve to Iriſh Peers a trial by their Peers in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which kinde of trial was never before had, uſed or practiſed in that Realme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore the Priſoner ſhall be tried by an ordinary Jury at this Bar, not by his Iriſh Peers; becauſe, if he were in <hi>Ireland,</hi> (for ought appears yet to me he ſhould not be tried by his Peers there; and in both theſe points, the Book in <hi>Dyer,</hi> (the only Authoriry which ſeems to be ſtrongeſt againſt, is for me) the words whereof are theſe in Engliſh.

               </hi> which comes full in <hi>terminis</hi> to what I have laſt inſiſted on, and I am certain cannot be diſproved.

            <p>By which it is moſt clear, That from King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds dayes, (who firſt ſubdued <hi>Ireland,</hi> An. 1171.) there were no trials in <hi>Ireland,</hi> of any Engliſh or Iriſh Peers Subjects to our Kings, for Treaſon by their Iriſh Peers by vertue of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> till after the Statute of 10 <hi>H.</hi> 7. which was made but forty ſix yeers before the Statute of 35 <hi>H.</hi> 8. between which, and this later Law we read not of one trial of any Iriſh Peer for treaſon there by his Peers, nor yet ſince, that I can find (but only one of late by 2 El. c. 1, 6.) till this very day: By which it is moſt apparent, that this tryal by Peers in <hi>Ireland</hi> a privilege now inficted on) was never actually claimed or enjoyed by any Peer of <hi>Ireland,</hi> eſpecially by thoſe in antient emnity and rebellion againſt our Kings, ſtiled <note n="*" place="margin">Here p. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <hi>enemies</hi> in the <hi>Irish</hi> Statutes, and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Records before the Statute of 35 H. 8. and ſo it can be no prejudice nor injuſtice at all, nor breach of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> to out the Priſoner of it.</p>
            <p>2ly. It may be queſtioned upon very good Reaſons, whether the Statute of 10 <hi>H. 7. ch.</hi> 22. doth conſirm this Statute of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> or not? at leaſt as to Iriſh Peers, eſpecially thoſe of the old Iriſh Bloud (to whom it relates not, as I have proved in the point of trial by Peers,) and that upon theſe Grounds.</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe the words of that Statute are not, That <hi>all Laws made in</hi> England <hi>ſhall be confirmed, received and executed in</hi> Ireland <hi>in all points:</hi> but, That <hi>all Statutes late made within the Realm of</hi> England, <hi>concerning or belonging to the Commonweal (not Peers) of the ſame, ſhall henceforth be deemed good and effectual in Law, and received &amp; executed in this Realm of</hi> Ireland. Now <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> being no Law then <hi>late made within this Realm,</hi> but made at leaſt 271 years before it, can hardly (without much ſtraining of the words beyond their proper meaning) be brought within the compaſs of this Act, though Sir <hi>Ed. Cook</hi> in his fourth Inſtitutes, <hi>pag.</hi> 351. informs us, That <hi>Hil.</hi> 10 Jac. <hi>it was reſolved by the two chief Juſtices and chief Baron, that this
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:115516:34"/>
word</hi> LATE <hi>in this Act, hath the ſence of</hi> BEFORE, <hi>and ſhall not be taken in its proper ſence or meaning:</hi> ſo that the Act by this conſtruction, againſt the ſence of the words, extends to <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and to all the Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made in <hi>England,</hi> not only <hi>late,</hi> but even long <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;</hi> yea, many hundred yeers before this Act; which for my part (under the favour of thoſe Reverend Judges who thus interpret it) I hold ſtill diſputeable, yea, erronious, and no Law at all, eſpecially for theſe two Reaſons.</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe if any Law introduced and confirmed <hi>Magna Charta</hi> and the other Laws of <hi>England</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> it is the Statute of 8 <hi>E. 4. c.</hi> 1. which confirms the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute made in <hi>England</hi> in the Parliament of 6 <hi>R. 2. ch.</hi> 6. concerning Rapes, of which there was ſome doubt made <hi>whether it extended to Ireland?</hi> and then concludes thus: <hi>In avoyding of all inconvenience that might happen, becauſe of the ambiguity of the ſaid Statute, Be it enacted, confirmed and ratified by authority of the ſaid Parliament, that the ſaid Statute be adjudged and approved in force and ſtrength, and may be of force in this Land, from the 6th day of</hi> March <hi>laſt paſt; and that from henceforth, the ſaid Act, <hi>and all other Statutes and Acts</hi>
               </hi> made <hi>by Authority of Parliament within the Realm of</hi> England, <hi>be ratified, confirmed and adjudged by Authority of this Parliament in their force and ſtrength, from the ſaid 6th day of</hi> March. So that this Law, if any at all, confirmed <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and all the Statutes made by Authority of Parliament in <hi>England,</hi> to be in force and uſe in <hi>Ireland,</hi> (yet only as to the Engliſh &amp; Iriſh Subjects under the Kings obedience, and none elſe, as I have proved,) and this Statute of 10 <hi>H.</hi> 7. which confirms only the Statutes lately made, muſt and doth in truth and reaſon relate only to the Laws made in <hi>England</hi> ſince that Statute of 8 <hi>E. 4. c.</hi> 1. not formerly there confirmed by that Act: ſo that the Priſoners Plea, That <hi>Magna Charta</hi> was confirmed by 10 <hi>H.</hi> 7. is but a meer miſtake and a void Plea: neither are the Judges here bound to take notice of this Iriſh Act of 8 <hi>E. 4. c.</hi> 1. unleſs pleaded by
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:115516:34"/>
the Priſoner, being no Law of this Kingdom and not binding here.</p>
            <p>2. Becauſe the forementioned Charters of <note n="*" place="margin">Here p. 32, 33, 34.</note> 6 <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. and 30 <hi>H. 3. &amp;c.</hi> confirming the uſe of the Laws of the Realm of <hi>England</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> did not extend to ſettle <hi>Magna Charta</hi> there, (at leaſt wiſe not as to the benefit of the natural Iriſh, but to the Engliſh and the Iriſh within the Engliſh Pale alone) as is agreed by Sir <hi>Ed. Cook,</hi> and in a manner reſolved by this Act of 10 <hi>H.</hi> 7. as the words thereof, <hi>From henceforth be deemed good and effectual in the Law, and over that be uſed, accepted and executed within the Land of</hi> Ireland, <hi>in all points, at all times requiſite,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. And if thoſe Charters extended not to <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> which are fuller then this Act, I doubt this Law will hardly do it.</p>
            <p>3ly. Admit the Law of 10 <hi>H.</hi> 7. extends to <hi>Magna Charta</hi> in ſome particulars thereof formerly uſed in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> yet it reacheth not to the trying of Iriſh Peers by their Peers now in queſtion, for theſe enſuing Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe trial of Iriſh Peers, by their Peers in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was never uſed nor heard of, nor is there any one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to be found before or ſince <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> till 10 <hi>H.</hi> 7. which there ſetled that great Charter for a Law, nor from 10 <hi>H.</hi> 7. till 35 <hi>H.</hi> 8. nor ſince that, but of late in one caſe only about twenty yeers ſince, till this inſtant. Now what <hi>Littleton</hi> notes of the Statute of <hi>Merton,</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">See Cook ibid.</note> Sect. 108. <q>That no action can be brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Statute for a diſparagement, for that ſince the making of it, it was never ſeen nor heard, that any ſuch Action was brought upon it againſt the Guardian: and if any Action might have been brought upon this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it will be intended that ſometime it would have been put in ure.</q> The like ſhall I ſay concerning <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Charta,</hi> and the trial of Iriſh Peers by their Peers in <hi>Ireland,</hi> That if the trying of Iriſh Peers by their Peers had been the common Law of <hi>Ireland,</hi> or if <hi>Magna Charta</hi> and 10 <hi>H.</hi> 7. had eſtabliſhed it there for a Law, it

               </gap>re, and ſome Peers there would have claimed and enjoyed this their priviledge in point of Trial: but ſince it was never yet in uſe there, for ought I finde, nor any one can prove, before 35 <hi>H.</hi> 8. I cannot deem it the common Law, nor Priviledge of the Peers of <hi>Ireland,</hi> but the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Priviledge of our Engliſh Peers, both by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Statute-Law, and great-Charter of <hi>England,</hi> and no trial of right incident to Iriſh Peers as it is to Engliſh. Therefore this kinde of Trial neither is confirmed to, nor intended to be conferred on Iriſh Peers by <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> which is but a confirmation only of our <note n="*" place="margin">Co. 2 Inſtit. Proem.</note> common Laws of <hi>England,</hi> and no introduction of any new Law here; and ſo ſhould introduce no new Law there, but confirm the common Laws and Cuſtomes there formerly uſed and ſo the Tryal by Peers is not there ſetled in reſpect of the <hi>Irish</hi> Peers, by the Statute of 10 <hi>H.</hi> 7. Now that which principally confirms me in this opinion is the two ſpecial Acts of Parliament, made in <hi>Ireland</hi> in 2 <hi>Eliz.</hi> c. 1. &amp; 6. <note n="*" place="margin">Page 30.</note> already cited, which create a ſpecial form of tryal of <hi>Iriſh Peers,</hi> not by their Peers there of <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish</hi> blood, but by their Peers of that <hi>Realm of the English</hi> blood alone, only in the new <hi>Treaſons</hi> and <hi>Premu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nires</hi> ſpecified in and created by thoſe two Acts; but in no other Treaſons: Which clauſes had been merely nuga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and ſuperfluous had the Tryal of <hi>Irish</hi> Peers in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> by <hi>Irish</hi> Peers been the birth-right and known pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privilege of <hi>Irish</hi> Peers, either by the Common law there uſed, or by the Cuſtome of <hi>Ireland,</hi> or by <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Charta,</hi> with this Act of 10 <hi>H.</hi> 7. confirming it; It therefore never being the intent of this Act, nor of <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Charta,</hi> to grant any new privilege or form of Tryal to <hi>Irish</hi> Peers, which they never formerly enjoyed, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the one nor other will ſufficiently ſupport the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners plea; nor indulge him any tryal here or there by his Peers of <hi>Ireland</hi> (at leaſt of Irish blood) for ſo horrid a Treaſon as this; Which I hope is a ſatisfactory an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to this <hi>objection, ſince Cuſtome is the beſt Expoſiter of all

            </p>
            <p>4ly. Admit the Objection true, That <hi>Magna Charta</hi> extends to <hi>Ireland,</hi> by vertue of this Act of 10 <hi>H.</hi> 7. ſo far as to give Iriſh Peers in <hi>Ireland,</hi> (though not of the Engliſh Pale) a trial by their Peers, which they had not before its confirmation there; yet then I anſwer, That this Statute of 35 <hi>H. 8. ch.</hi> 2, upon which the Priſoner is arraigned, by making all Treaſons done and perpetrated in <hi>Ireland,</hi> triable in <hi>England,</hi> when there is juſt occaſion, (as now there is in this time of a univerſal horrid Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, and in ſundry other forementioned reſpects) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals this Clauſe of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and deprives the Priſoner of the benefit of his Peerage, if at all conferred on him by it, and the Act of 10 <hi>H.</hi> 7. Since it is moſt certain, that Statutes made in the Parliaments of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> (being the ſupreme Kingdom and Court, to which <hi>Ireland</hi> &amp; its <hi>Courts</hi> are ſubordinate, and whoſe erronious judgements in their High Courts and Parliaments there, were only reverſible here in <hi>England</hi> in the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> and <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>England</hi> as is evident by <hi>Clauſ. 7.

makes them ſubject to a trial here, whether Peers or Commoners, as I have already proved.</p>
            <p>5ly. It is unqueſtionable, That every Commoner of <hi>Ireland,</hi> hath as large, as full an intereſt in <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> the Laws and Priviledges of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and as much right to be tried in <hi>Ireland</hi> for Treaſon there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by an Iriſh Jury, as any Peer in <hi>Ireland</hi> hath in or by them to be tried there by his Peers, theſe Laws being no reſpecters of perſons, and every mans birth right alike, of Commons as much as of Peers, as the Laws and great Charter of <hi>England</hi> are; <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> being as larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made and as amply granted to the meaneſt Freeman as to the greateſt Peers of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue and 9, 14, 15 19, 21, 22, 26, 27, 29<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chapters there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of reſolve.</p>
            <p>Since then this Act of 35 <hi>H. 8. chap.</hi> 2. doth without all controverſie (as hath been reſolved in the forecited Caſe) deprive the Commoners of <hi>Ireland</hi> of a Trial in <hi>Ireland</hi> by Iriſh Commoners, and ſubjects them to a trial by an Engliſh Jury here for Treaſons there committed; for which by the common Law, the Cuſtomes of <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> before the Statute of 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. and this Act of 35 <hi>H.</hi> 8. they could be no where tried but only in <hi>Ireland,</hi> not in <hi>England,</hi> as is collected from the Caſe of Sir <hi>Elias Aſhburnam,</hi> Tr. 18 <hi>E. 3. coram Rege,</hi> Rot. 14. cited by Sir <hi>Edward Cook</hi> in his 4 <hi>Inſtit.</hi> p. 356. (the principal caſe that can be objected againſt me, which makes nothing to the purpoſe, being long before theſe Statutes were made:) Therefore by the ſelf ſame reaſon it ſhall take away the trial of Iriſh Peers in <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>England</hi> by Iriſh or Engliſh Peers, for Treaſons perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated by them in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and ſubject them to a trial by an ordinary Engliſh Jury at this Bar, or before Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners in any County of <hi>England,</hi> as I have already proved; which Jury here are in truth Peers to all I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Peers, being here no Peers at all, but onely Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners.</p>
            <p>If it be objected, That this Law of 35 <hi>H. 8. chap.</hi> 2.<note place="margin">Object.</note>

Therefore it ſhall not take away the tryal by Peerage from <hi>Iriſh Peers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer 1. That you may by like reaſon object, that<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> it cannot take away a Tryal in <hi>Ireland</hi> by an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Jury from <hi>Iriſh</hi> Commoners, ſeeing it cannot repeal <hi>Magna Charta</hi> and the Common-law; But this objection is yielded, and adjudged idle in caſe of an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Commoner; therefore it is, and muſt be ſo in caſe of an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Peer.</p>
            <p>2ly. The objected Statutes do make void and null all Acts and Statutes made againſt <hi>Magna Charta</hi> before the Parliaments wherein they were made; but they extend not at all to future real Parliaments and their Acts, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent Parliaments having alwaies had power to control, alter, abrogate precedent Acts; yea the very Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law and <hi>Great Charter</hi> it ſelf, when inconvenient or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, as all our Books accord: Therefore Sir <hi>Edward Cook</hi> in his 4 <hi>Inſtitutes p.</hi> 42. reſolves and proves at large, by 11 R. 2. c. 3. 5 ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>3ly.

Therefore a <hi>Fortiori</hi> it muſt both alter and repeal the Common-law and great Charter as to <hi>Irish</hi> Subjects, for whom the great <hi>Charter</hi> was never originally made, not yet directly confirmed to them by 10 <hi>H.</hi> 7. but only impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly and doubtfully at moſt, as I have proved.</p>
            <p>4ly. I anſwer, that this Act of 35 H. 8. doth no waies abrogate or alter <hi>Magna Charta</hi> in truth or reality, but rather ratifie &amp; confirm it, in the form and manner of this Tryal, though not in the place. For <hi>Magwire</hi> being only a Peer in <hi>Ireland,</hi> but not in <hi>England;</hi> Every Free-man of <hi>England</hi> that ſhall be impanneled to try him, is in truth &amp; law his Peer here: And this Act, enacting that he ſhall be tryed, not by Marſhal-law, or the Judges themſelves, <hi>but by good and lawfull men of the Shyre, where the Kings Bench ſhall ſit,</hi> who are his equals and Peers in <hi>England,</hi> and ſaving the <hi>Tryal by Peers</hi> to every <hi>Peer of this Realm</hi> after his indictment found by Jury: This way and form of tryal by Jury in <hi>England</hi> being then and now the Law of the Land, is no contradiction or repeal at all, but a direct purſute and confirmation thereof, according to its letter &amp; meaning. And ſo much in anſwer to this grand objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wherein I have been over tedious, but ſhall recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence it with brevity in the remainder.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Objection (a meer branch of the former)<note place="margin">Object. 2.</note> is this.</p>

            <p>I anſwer 1. That I have manifeſted, that this tryal<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> by <hi>Peers</hi> was never deemed, claimed, nor enjoyed in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as a privilege by <hi>Iriſh Peers,</hi> nor ever uſed or practiſed in that land before this Act, &amp; but once claimed ſince, and that in <hi>Ireland.</hi> Therefore it cannot be inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that this Statute or the makers of it ever imagined to ſave this manner of Tryal by <hi>Peers</hi> only to <hi>Irish Peers,</hi> which they never enjoyed, nor ſo much as once claimed or poſſeſſed before the making of it. Neither can it be any injury or injuſtice to deprive them of that now they never heretofore claimed, uſed, enjoyed, as their privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, and birth-right, being not indubitably ſetled on them by any Law that I have ſeen; but only in ſome ſpecial Caſes of Treaſon ſince 35 <hi>H.</hi> 8. wherof this is none by the late Acts of 2 <hi>El. z. c.</hi> 1. &amp; 6. when as this privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege is taken from them, not by a bare ſtrained expoſition, or implication, but by this expreſs Act of Parliament made long ſince for the Common good and ſafety of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> not yet repealed.</p>
            <p>2ly. This Objection with as great or greater ſtrength colour, might be made for all the Commons of <hi>Ireland</hi> (far more numerous and conſiderable than their <hi>Peers</hi>) they being deprived by it of tryals by <hi>Irish</hi> Juries in their native Country, than for <hi>Irish Peers</hi> alone; which Tryal here againſt <hi>Irish</hi> Commons was never of late ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted againſt, this Law having been ſo often adjudged to reach to them; Therefore there is no colour, to exempt <hi>Irish Peers</hi> out of it.</p>
            <p>3ly. This pretended prejudice to <hi>Irish Peers</hi> in point of Tryal by their <hi>Peers,</hi> is ſoly in caſes of <hi>High Treaſons,</hi>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:115516:38"/>
or <hi>Miſpriſion</hi> and <hi>concealments of it,</hi> and no other, the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute extending to no crimes, but theſe alone. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the miſchief is not great in general; and no <hi>Irish Peers</hi> (I preſume) but ſuch who have trayterous or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyal hearts, will deem it a diſparagement or injuſtice to them, to be ſecluded of a Tryal by their Peers only in theſe Caſes of High Treaſon: And if others who are profeſſed Rebels and Traytors murmur at it (as none elſe will) we need not much regard it, nor prefer their pretended privilege, before our own Kings, Kingdomes, Religions, yea <hi>Irelands</hi> ſafety and wellfare, in bringing them to a ſpeedy tryal and condign puniſhments for their Treaſons here in <hi>England</hi> by vertue of this Law.</p>
            <p>3ly. Even by the very Common law before this Act, Treaſons committed in <hi>Ireland</hi> by Peers or Commons, were tryable before the Marſhall of <hi>England,</hi> in <hi>England</hi> it ſelf, as is evident by the Parliament Roll of 2 H. 6. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:115516:38"/>
the Law and common reaſon will inform every man, that the King and State will never be at the coſt and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſend for Traytors and Witneſſes out of <hi>Ireland</hi> to try them here, but upon a moſt juſt occaſion and urgent neceſſity, to prevent either a faiter or delay of Juſtice in caſe of horrid Treaſons and Rebellions; And no Iriſh Peer who hath any loyalty in his heart, or reaſon in his head, will deem it a diſhonor, or prejudice to the whole Iriſh Peerage in general, or the trayterous Peers ſent hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be tryed in particular, to be outed of a tryal by Iriſh Peers in ſuch Caſes of neceſsity, and expediency only; it being better and ſafer for this Realm and <hi>Ireland</hi> too, that theſe <hi>native Iriſh Peers, who have been proved to break out into actual Rebellion in all</hi> ages (as this Priſoners Anceſtors have done as much or more than any, his <note n="*" place="margin">Cambdens Ireland, p. 111, 120, 121, 199.</note>

Noble blood. And if it be neither injuſtice, nor injurie, nor inconvenience, to deprive theſe Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical English Peers of a trial by Peers in caſes of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or felony at the Kings ſute though within the letter of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and to try them by an indifferent Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of Freeholders; It cannot be reputed any inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, injury, rejudice, or inconvenience at all now to out this Iriſh Peer of his Peerage here, where he is no native Peer, for ſuch an horrid Treaſon as this.</p>
            <p>4ly. Iriſh Peers are no Peers at all in <hi>England,</hi> upon which account and reaſon if they commit Treaſon herein they ſhall be tried by an ordinarie Jury; Therefore to try them onlie by Freeholders, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> by Peers in <hi>England,</hi> can be no injurie nor diſhonour to their Peerage, unleſs it were in <hi>Ireland</hi> where they are Peers; and yet have been ſeldome or never hitherto tried there by their Peers, as I have proved.</p>
            <p>5ly. The verie Statutes of <hi>Ireland</hi> it ſelf made by the Peers and Commons thereof to prevent manie miſchiefs by Theeves, Murderers, and Rebells in that Realm, do deprive both the Lords &amp; Commons there of any legal trial at all both for their lives and eſtates too, witneſs the Statutes of 28 H. 6. c. 1. 3 &amp; 5 E. 4. c. 2. &amp; expoſe them to the judgement, ſlaughter, plunder of particular men in ſome caſes, authorizing <hi>all manner of men that find any theeves robbing, breaking up houſes, by day or night, or going or comming to rob or ſteal, having no faithfull man of good name and fame in their company, in Engliſh apparel, to take and kill thoſe</hi>

Irish Enemy received to the Kings allegiance shall afterwards rob, ſpoyl, and deſtroy the Kings Liege peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, it shall be lawfull for every Liege-man that may meet with him afterwards, to do with him, and his Goods and Chattels as to Enemies who were never Liege, and to ranſome them at their free will, without any impeachment of the Law.</hi> And Ch. 6. <hi>If any men, except Knights &amp; Prelates shall wear gilded Bridle, Peſtrels, or other harneys, that it shall be lawfull to every man that will, to take the ſaid man his horſe and harneſſe, and to poſſeſs the ſame as his own Goods, without endictment or legal tryal.</hi> All which would be monſtrous in <hi>England.</hi> Therfore it is much more legal and juſt, and no injurie at all to try the Priſoner, an Arch-Rebel in <hi>England,</hi> in this time of war and combuſtion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> for his Treaſons there perpetrated, by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, honeſt, lawfull English Jury, upon an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment found by the grand Inqueſt, than thus to kill, behead ſuch Malefactors in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and ſeiſe both them and their Goods as Enemies, and ranſome them at pleaſure without Tryal, Jury, or Endictment, and not only to indemnifie but reward thoſe that do it, by Laws there made by the Engliſh, and Irish themſelves: which will anſwer all Objections, and wipe off the leaſt ſhadow of Injuſtice in this Caſe, and tryal.</p>
            <p>The third Objection is this, That if Irish Peers had been within this Law, there being ſo many rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions<note place="margin">Object. 3.</note> in <hi>Ireland</hi> ſince its enacting, we should have had ſome Preſidents of Irish Peers here tried by Jurie, ere this; But there is no ſuch Preſident extant; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore certainlie Irish Peers for Treaſons perpetrated in <hi>Ireland</hi> are out of this Act.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, 1. That no Iriſh Peers have been tried by their Peers in <hi>Ireland</hi> for treaſons ſince this Act; <hi>ergo</hi> they are within i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>2. That this Argument is merely fallacious and non concludant: for the reaſon why no Irish Peers have been tried here ſince this Law by vertue of it, is not becauſe they were not deemed within it, but for other reaſons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:115516:41"/>1. Becauſe moſt of the Irish Peers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who have been in actual rebellion ſince this Law, were <note n="*" place="margin">See the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and Mr. Camb. in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, p. 121 to 200.</note>

            <p>2ly. Becauſe ſome <hi>Irish Rebels,</hi> as great as <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wire,</hi> or anie of their Peers in power and eſtate, have been heretofore tried and executed for Treaſon in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> by vertue of this Law; though brought over hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from <hi>Ireland</hi> againſt their wills; as <hi>Orourke</hi> and Sir <hi>John Parrot</hi> of old, and <hi>Mac-Mahon</hi> the laſt Term<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Tryals of theſe three here are direct Preſidents in point, and good warrant by this very Act for the Tryal alſo of this Irish Peer, as I have proved.</p>
            <p>3ly. This Statute is not very antient, yet ſtill in as full force as ever, and if this be the firſt Preſident of an Iriſh Peer that came judicially in queſtion here in <hi>England,</hi> to be tryed upon it ſince its making, it is no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he is out of this Law, but rather an Inducement to make him a leading Preſident to thoſe rebellious Peers of that Nation, who have been the <hi>Ring-leaders</hi> of the ordinary Commons there in this grand Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there being no Preſident, Judgement, nor foild seaſon againſt it; Yea <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

the Book hath been ſince ſeveral times adjudged to be no reaſon at all nor Law, by all the Judges of <hi>England,</hi> a Subject of <hi>Ireland</hi> being a <note n="*" place="margin">See here p. 32, to 42.</note> Subject to the King of <hi>England</hi> in all places, as is adjudged in <hi>Calvins</hi> Caſe, and that <hi>Wrey</hi> diſclaimed any ſuch opinion delivered by him as is there reported. Therefore the reaſon of this opinion being adjudged erroneous and no Law, the opinion it ſelf grounded on it, muſt needs be ſo too. The rather, becauſe the opinion there cited was upon a Caſe caſually put and moved out of Court by way of diſcourſe, without ſtudy or argument, and ſuddenly delivered only by <hi>Dyer</hi> and <hi>Gerrard</hi> (ſince <hi>Wrey</hi> diſclaimed it) but not given upon any cauſe actually depending or debated and argued in Court. 2ly. That it is a full authority for me, both becauſe it determines, there can be no Tryal of an Iriſh Peer by his Peers in <hi>England</hi> but only by a Jury; and that in <hi>Ireland</hi> it ſelf, <hi>Peers are not uſed to be tryed by Peers, but attainted by Act of Parliament;</hi> Therefore an authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty point-blank againſt the Priſoners plea.</p>

Judges reſolved <hi>the Book in</hi> Dyer <hi>to be no Law,</hi> and <hi>Wrey</hi> diſclaimed any ſuch opinion of his therein re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, as Sir <hi>Edward Cooks</hi> Inſtitutes on <hi>Littleton, fol.</hi> 261. <hi>b.</hi> records.</p>
            <p>The 6th. Objection is this, (intimated in an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<note place="margin">Object. 6.</note> of the <hi>Lords Houſe</hi>) That this may much concern the Peers of <hi>England;</hi> For this Law for trying forein <hi>Treaſons</hi> is enacted in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and ſo by colour of it <hi>Engliſh Peers may be ſent over into</hi> Ireland <hi>to be tryed there by a Jury of Iriſh Commoners, for Treaſons done in</hi> England, <hi>as well as Iriſh Peers ſent thence to be tryed by ordinarie Juries here in England for Treaſons committed in</hi> Ireland.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, 1. That there is no ſuch Law extant in<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> 
               <hi>Ireland,</hi> that I can fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d, among all their printed Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, ſo as this is a vain ſurmiſe.</p>
            <p>But 2ly. if there were any ſuch Law there, yet <hi>England</hi> being the ſupreme Realm to <hi>Ireland,</hi> may make Laws in the Parliament here to bind the <hi>Iriſh Peers</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> but the Parliament in <hi>Ireland</hi> being a <note n="*" place="margin">See Crokes Rep. p. 264 511, 512.</note> ſubordinate Realm to <hi>England,</hi> never yet did nor can make any Laws at all to bind any <hi>English Peers</hi> or Commons for things done in <hi>England,</hi> (untill the Rebels there ſhall be able to conquer <hi>England,</hi> which I hope they never ſhall) as we have conquer'd them. Therefore we need not fear any ſuch obliging Laws of theirs, or the tryal of Engliſh Peers in <hi>Ireland.</hi> So as this vain fancy is quite out of Dores, and the Lords themſelves upon conference with the Commons, have been fully ſatisfied that this Caſe no waies concerneth the <hi>Peers of England,</hi> whoſe <hi>Tryal by their Peers</hi> is by direct proviſo ſaved to them in this Act, and therefore cannot come in queſtion, or be taken from them by pretence of any ſuch Law e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed in <hi>Ireland;</hi> Whereupon they have <hi>reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their Order,</hi> which ſeemed to give ſome colour for this Objection.</p>

            <p>A ſeventh Objection, which I have heard made<note place="margin">Object. 7.</note> by ſome, is as vain and abſurd as the former, That if Iriſh Peers be within this Act for Treaſons done in <hi>Ireland,</hi> then by the ſame reaſon Peers in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> might be ſent for and brought into <hi>England,</hi> and there tryed by an ordinary Jury by vertue of this Law, for Treaſons done in <hi>Scotland;</hi> which would be a great prejudice to the Peers of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the privileges of that Kingdome.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, 1. That this Act extends not to any<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> Treaſons of <hi>Scots Lords or</hi> Commons committed or acted in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and tryable there, though it reacheth to <hi>Irish Lords</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Becauſe this Act was made long before the <hi>union</hi> betwixt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> by 1 <hi>Iac.</hi> c. 2, 3. <hi>Iac.</hi> c. 3, 4 <hi>Iac.</hi> c. 1. &amp; 16 <hi>Caroli:</hi> whiles that <hi>Scotland</hi> was under the abſolute and immediate power of its

            <p>The laſt Objection I can think of is this, That in<note place="margin">Object. 8.</note> every Caſe of Treaſon or Felony new made by Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, the Lords of Parliament in <hi>England</hi> ſhall have their Tryal by their <hi>Peers</hi> ſaved, not withſtanding the Statute provides not for it by expreſs words; ſo that proviſoes <hi>of Tryal by their Peers</hi> inſerted into them in ſuch Caſes, are but idle, and <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is provided for both by the Common law and by <hi>Magna Charta</hi> it ſelf, <hi>c.</hi> 29. and ſo was it adjudged in the caſe of the Lord <hi>Hungerford</hi> heretofore,

               </gap>9. Therefore the Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Iriſh Peers by their Peers ſhall be likewiſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to them within this Act, though it be not expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as well as the Tryal by Peers is to Engliſh Peeers by expreſſe Proviſoe.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, Firſt, that this rule holds generallie<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> true in all Caſes of new Treaſons and Felonies where the offences only are made capital, or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhable according to the antient, uſual, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie proceedings of Law, and the manner of the Tryal of them left at large and not preciſelie limited how and by whom they ſhall be tryed; As they are in the objected Caſes upon the Statutes of 25 H. 8. c. 6. &amp; 5 Eliz. cap. 17. concerning <hi>Buggery:</hi> where the words are, <hi>That this Vice ſhall be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged Felony, and that ſuch order and form of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs shall thereupon be uſed againſt the Offenders, as in Caſes of Felony at the Common law, and that the Offenders being thereof convicted by verdict, confeſsion, or Outlawry, shall ſuffer pain of death, &amp;c.</hi> which words without the leaſt contradiction, ſtand as well with Tryal of Peers who are guilty of it by their Peers alone, as of Commons by a Jury, they being both according to the <hi>order of our Common law,</hi> and a <hi>verdict by Peers is as</hi> properlie ſtiled a <hi>verdict</hi> in Law, as a verdict by Jurie, witneſſe 1 H. 4. 1. and <hi>Cooks</hi> 3 Inſtitut. ch. 2. p. 30. But in the Statute of 35 H. 8. there is no creation or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction at all of any <hi>New Treaſons,</hi> but only an introduction of a <hi>new form and way of Tryal</hi> for Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons formerly made and declared ſuch, then done, or hereafter to be committed out of this Realm, and that new form of Tryal preciſely limited in all

particulars, and eſpecially enacted to be by an <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Iury,</hi> except onlie in Caſe of our <hi>English Peers;</hi> Therfore this Statute comes not at all within the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, becauſe it particularlie defines the place where, the Judges before whom, the Juries by whom, with the whole form and manner how, ſuch forein Treaſons ſhall be tryed, with all other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the Tryal, and expreſly preſcribes; <hi>That all</hi> but Engliſh Peers indicted for <hi>forein Treaſons, shall be tryed by good and lawfull men of the Shire where the Kings Bench or Commiſsioners ſit.</hi> Therefore to alter this form of Tryal preciſely preſcribed by this Statute, by introducing a new Tryal by <hi>Irish Peers,</hi> is to run quite croſs againſt, and elude, repeal this Sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ute, as I have argued and proved at large.</p>
            <p>I have now quite done with my Argument of this new untroden Caſe, and I hope therein ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manifeſted, that this Plea of the Priſoner is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valid, and ſuch as ought to be over-ruled in point of Law: And therefore as he hath been ſent for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver from <hi>Ireland</hi> by the wiſdome and Juſtice of our Parliament, and by the Lords, Juſtices, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel there tranſmitted hither to receive a juſt, and ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Tryal at this Bar for his bloody Treaſons, which there (in reſpect of the Rebels power, Tumults in that Realm) he could not conveniently undergo: So I humbly pray on the behalf of the <hi>King, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, Parliament,</hi> and our whole <hi>English Nation,</hi> to all which he hath been ſuch a capital <hi>Traytor</hi> and <hi>Enemy, that this Plea of his may preſently be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled, and himſelf brought to his ſpeedy Tryal, Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and execution for his unparallel'd Treaſons, and the blood of thoſe many thouſands of innocent</hi> Engliſh Proteſtants <hi>ſhed in</hi> Ireland <hi>upon this occaſion,</hi> which cries for Juſtice and Execution againſt him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:115516:44"/>
further delay. The rather, becauſe <hi>nulli differe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Juſticiam,</hi> is one clauſe of that very Act of <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Charta, ca.</hi> 29. which he hath pleaded in bar of his Tryal, of which I pray both he and the whole Kingdom may now enjoy the benefit, by his undelay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Tryal and execution too, in Caſe he ſhall be found guilty of the Treaſons for which he ſtands indicted; of which there is little doubt, ſince ſo fully confeſſed by himſelf in a writing under his own hand, and we are ready to make them good againſt him, as we have already done againſt his Confederate <hi>Mac-Mahon,</hi> by the Teſtimony of a clowd of honorable pregnant witneſſes, in caſe he ſhall deny it.</p>
            <p>After two Arguments at the Bar on both ſides of this Caſe, <hi>Juſtice Bacon</hi> argued it himſelf, and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his opinion and judgement againſt the Priſoners plea: that <hi>though he be a Baron of</hi> Ireland, <hi>yet he was triable for his Treaſon by a</hi> Middleſex Jury <hi>in the Kings Bench, and outed of his Peerage,</hi> by 35 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 2.
