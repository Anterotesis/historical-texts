         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

themselves to a diligent observation of the <hi>contexture</hi> and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension</hi> of affaires, as they have beene these later yeeres ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged by our Adversaries: That so comparing one part of their proceedings with another, and all with this proposed end of subverting the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> together with the <hi>Subjects Liberty,</hi> (the <hi>Elme</hi> of that <hi>Vine</hi>) the impartiall and diligent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may discerne an evident conjuncture of <hi>Iesuits, Priests, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Prelates, Papists, Polititians, Atheists, prophane</hi> and <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant persons,</hi> for the ruine of that <hi>Religion,</hi> to which some of them are <hi>Professed Enemies,</hi> others <hi>Pretended Friends,</hi> but which of them the most pernitious is hard to judge.</p>
            <p>But, that no body may be wronged, this Heterogeneous num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber must, in reference to this great worke, receive its proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable distribution; and we must not conceive all these equally engaged, or upon the same grounds. <hi>Babel</hi> is to be built, the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitects</hi> are the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> taking in some <hi>Atheisticall Politicians</hi> to their assistance, as <hi>Surveyors</hi> of the worke: <hi>Princes</hi> must finde the materialls, as being made believe that the worke is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed for the House of their Kingdome, and the honour of their Majesty. <hi>Papists,</hi> with the rabble of <hi>superstitious</hi> and <hi>ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Clergie,</hi> are the daily <hi>Labourers,</hi> the prophane and ignorant multitude are imployed in the most servi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>And because all these must be presumed reasonable men (though the later sort are used as <hi>naturall bruit beasts, made to be taken and destroye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </hi>) who, though they are not so wise as to know what they do, yet must not be thought so foolish as not to know why they take this paines, different ends are held out. And therefore this great building is designed as a <hi>Church</hi> for the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists Devotion, as a <hi>Palace</hi> for the Prelates ambition, as a <hi>Castle</hi> for the Princes power, and the rest have severall baits by these cunning Anglers cast out unto them, according to the variety of their dispositions.</p>
            <p>But lest I should seeme rather to write then to reveale a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, it will be convenient to use all plainnesse of speech, that they who are concerned may discern truth before it be beaten into their heads with a Poleax.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:60987:3"/>First, I presume it will be granted on all parts, that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Strumpet is very industrious to corrupt the Earth with her Fornications, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 2. and hath to that end constituted a great Councell, <hi>De propaganda fide,</hi> as they call it, but rather, <hi>De pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paganda perfidia,</hi> whose most vigilant Instruments and Emissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are the <hi>Iesuits,</hi> who have by their diligence obtained the honour to be <hi>Cupbearers</hi> of this Wine of Fornication, and are justly accounted by us those <hi>Frogs, comming out of the mouth of the Dragon, the Beast, and the false Prophet, going forth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kings of the Earth, and of the whole world, Rev.</hi> 16. 12. These men, as they compasse sea and land, and have spread them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves well nigh in all parts, so they have alwaies had a speciall eye to the Kingdomes of Brittaine, it being doubtlesse propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to them, and all Romish Agents, as a piece of eminent ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, if by any meanes that might be reduced to the vassalage of Rome.</p>
            <p>And this is the second step which I think there wil be no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing for, that the Romish Agents have bin very earnest and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious in reconciling this Iland with the adjacent to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; it being a service which the Pope himselfe disdained not to stoope to, in that Letter (yet uncontradicted) which he writ to the Prince in Spain, now extant in the English tongue; where he desires that the <hi>Prince of Wales</hi> might be brought backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine into the lap of the Romish Church, and the <hi>Prince of the Apostles</hi> put in possession of this most noble Isle. Which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires of the Pope have beene seconded with continuall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of swarmes of Iesuites and Priests resident amongst us.</p>
            <p>It being then granted, that ever since the Reformation there hath beene such a designe, it remaines to shew how it hath been prosecuted, and how farre it hath prevailed, where the Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment now is, what labour there is to remove it, that all true Protestants may the better understand their own condition and <hi>Interests.</hi> Onely let this be premised, that wee being to deale with a Mystery, a worke of darkenesse, it must not be expected that all which shall bee produced, should bee cleare and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing; as if a judicial proceeding were undertaken, but that the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60987:4"/>
Argument be so probable and dependant, as, though not a legall, yet a rationall judgement may be passed against our Adversaries in this Cause. And it hath beene a very unjust triumph of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy over the Parliament and their friends in want of evidence, when they have (though the nature of the businesse, being trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, and therefore clandestinely carried, and bound up by oathes of secresie) beene put to make up the grounds of their proceedings from the connexion of severall particulars and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities, which are enough for a Statesman, though not a Judge. And the diligent observer may take notice how these feares and jealousies, pretended to be groundlesse, have beene justified by after proceedings, as the use made of <hi>Newcastle</hi> hath vindicated the securing <hi>Hull.</hi> The Ship from <hi>Denmarke</hi> hath justified their suspition, grounded (as it is said) upon the slighted testimony of the <hi>Skipper</hi> at Roterdam. The Lord <hi>Digbies</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and the residence there of <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Cochran,</hi> the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions to the Scots at Newcastle (hereafter to be mentioned) for the joyning of the Scottish and English Armies against the Parliament, have justified all the suspitions and accusations, then pretended, and protested to be unjust and groundlesse. In such times and cases as these, feares and jealousies are pardonable, and distrust, especially after evident breaches of trust, is the mother of security. It is a very unequall thing, that the King with his Cavaliers should renounce the Parliament, destroy his good Subjects, upon the jealousie that Parliaments and Puritans are Enemies to his Prerogative and Power (which can never bee proved if Iustice be made the Rule of Power) and we railed on for defending our selves against the confederacie of Papists, Prelates, Court Parasites, and their Adherents, whose endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of introducing Popery and Tyranny, are farre beyond jealousie, as is now to be demonstrated.</p>
            <p>I will not retire so farre backe (having so much work before me) as to insist upon the manifest and manifold attempts upon this Kingdome in the dayes of Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> whom when they had discerned to have settled her <hi>Interests</hi> for the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants against <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> and established her Councell ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to those <hi>Interests:</hi> So that though the <hi>Bishops</hi> brought
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60987:4"/>
her to dis-favour <hi>Puritanes,</hi> yet they could not perswade her to favour the <hi>Papists,</hi> but she still kept a strict and vigilant eye over them, as being rightly informed, that they, and not the other, were the greatest Enemies to Royall Power. When they saw this, the usuall arts of <hi>Rome</hi> against dis-affected Princes, are put in practice, <hi>viz. Bulls, Interdicts, Poysonings, Assassinations;</hi> which God wonderfully preserved that heroicke Ladie from; the Spanish Armado, the Rebellion in Ireland, may be further Testimonies of their zeale in this business<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>. To the enumeration of these, let us onely adde thankfulnesse and caution, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to their after <hi>Machinations,</hi> the bitter fruits of which the <hi>Protestant</hi> Churches yet feele.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Iames,</hi> before he came to the Crowne of England, had a heart too large for his Dominion, and therefore extended his affectionate thoughts to the Kingdomes of England and Ireland, which he longed for a peaceable possession of.</p>
            <p>The Factors of Rome having studied his interest and nature, according to their wonted confidence attempt him: as for his <hi>Understanding,</hi> so well informed in the <hi>Forgeries</hi> and <hi>Falshoods</hi> of the Romish Religion, it was not to be ventured on, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they proportion their workings to his <hi>Passions,</hi> which were, desire of the accession of power, mixt with a more then ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry feare (in which he was naturally unhappy) lest he should be interrupted, if not disappointed in the entrance: And in this Conflict obtaine from him some intimations, if not assurances, of favour to the Catholique Cause, with which they were for the present satisfied.</p>
            <p>The King upon his entrance and settlement in England, saw cause rather to dispence with his promises then his principles; whereupon the Popish Faction grew discontented against him, and a fruit of that discontent was the <hi>Romish Hellish</hi> Powder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plot, never to be mentioned by any good Protestant, but with due gratitude to Almighty God, and just detestation of the Romish Religion.</p>
            <p>This Treason wrought not kindely with his Majesty: for whereas he might have made the <hi>Plot</hi> a ground of <hi>defiance,</hi> and the Deliverance a ground of confidence; the horrour of the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60987:5"/>
businesse wrought such impression of dread upon his timorous spirit, that though he was not blowne up, yet he was shaken by it all his life after, and drawn successively to a <hi>Compliance</hi> with, at least a <hi>Connivance</hi> at their proceedings. And notwithstanding the free exercise of his wit and pen against Popery, which they could well allow him, they constrained him to purchase his own security (contrary to the Interests of Protestant Religion, and Paternall affection) with the ruine of the neigbour Churches of Bohemia and the Palatinate.</p>
            <p>We should not have looked upon the day of our Brethren: to that we may reduce the many impediments that have fallen in betwixt us and the help of our friends, and that posture wherein God himselfe stands towards us, even <hi>as a man astonished, a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty man that cannot save,</hi> Jer. 14. 9. Though we have this hope left, that God will recompence that mischiefe, not upon the Nation, the body whereof had a just fellow-feeling with the distresses of their neighbours, but upon that curfed Faction whose pernicious Councels yet rule among us.</p>
            <p>This was the most considerable Progresse made in his time, though the preparatory workings for a fitter opportunity were not omitted, as the cherishing in him a dis-affection to <hi>Puritanes,</hi> an inclination to <hi>Bishops,</hi> procuring countenance to <hi>Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> both by practice, and Declaration to the remote Counties for licentious Sabbath-breaking, and settling about him persons regardlesse of the good of Church or Common-wealth. To which may be added the untimely death of Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> when it was once observed that he grew popular, inclined to martiall affaires, and dis-affected to Spanish proceedings. As also the Propositions of the Treaty of marriage with Spain offered from <hi>England,</hi> revised at <hi>Rome,</hi> and then by the Negotiation of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoll</hi> agreed to (though after broken) with so many advantages to the spreading of Popery in <hi>England,</hi> as might discover the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe to have been considerably advanced in King <hi>Iames</hi> his time.</p>
            <p>I shall shut up the discourse of his Reigne with this obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the providence of God: That those Princes who have trusted God with their lives and Kingdomes, and kept <hi>Spain</hi> and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60987:5"/>
               <hi>Rome</hi> at distance and defiance, have sped better then they, who to their dishonoured selves, have sacrificed the welfare of the Church of God, as, by comparing the History of Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For so it was, That when by the journey into <hi>Spain,</hi> fairer hopes were conceived of the Prince, as by his intercourse with the Pope, and the presumptions of the jesuite (which you shall finde in the Treatise of the English Pope, not unworthy an English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans deligent observation) most fully appears; King <hi>Iames</hi> came to be looked upon as <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, and must be taken out of the way, that the Mystery might work the more effectually, and so died he, both a Friend and Martyr of the Catholique Cause. Though it was doubted, and feared, there were severall ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients into his death, the world talks of a drink, and a plaister, the Cup might be mingled for <hi>Romes</hi> sake, and some other hands accessary to spreading the plaister; if so, Let them share the guilt, I leave them to him, whose eyes are upon all the wayes of men, to render them according to their wayes, and the fruit of their doing. It is said, the Archbishop of <hi>York,</hi> if he have not too much, or too little <hi>Grace,</hi> can tell you more of this businesse.</p>
            <p>Let our trembling pen passe on, to His now Majesties reign; and here doubtlesse some Apologie is expected, but I hope to say nothing that needs it; I shall endeavour to avoid known falshoods, or unseasonable truths.</p>
            <p>An earnest affection to the Preservation and Reformation of the Church of God, hath put me upon this disquisition, and the desire of preserving good men from a snare, which shall be in vain spread in the sight of any bird, hath prevailed with me for the discovery of my thoughts: It is in service to that Cause, which I desire not to over-live the welfare of. And therefore, without any more complement, Let us begin to search out the Pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            </p>
            <p>In the beginning of His Majesties reign, the Popish Faction having in <hi>Spain,</hi> and otherwise, obtained testimonies of His

            <p>Upon this marriage, is the Court (sufficiently loose, and luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious enough at all times) dissolved into Riots and Masquings, and in the midst of that noise, were our Counsells and Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises, most perfidiously mis-laid, and betrayed, as those of <hi>Ree</hi> and <hi>Cales,</hi> and especially that of <hi>Rochell,</hi> which, as if no sleighter a Complement could be thought of for the fair Lady, received from <hi>France,</hi> must by English hands, and Popish Councels, be betrayed in its Religion and Liberty. Thus is our guilt increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and our strength diminished; and lest the Remainder of it should be imployed according to the Interests of our Religion and Nation, a peace with <hi>Spain</hi> is concluded, the <hi>Palatinate</hi> left to that which leaves it yet miserable, and is hastening us after it, a Course of treating with them, who carry <hi>destruction and misery in their paths, but the way of peace they have not known.</hi> These things have been long known, but little considered; and it stands well enough with my intent and purpose, to repeat things mentioned by others, because I aym at shewing the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance of the Jesuiticall proceedings, one upon another, and all upon the main end of suoverting Religion and Liberty.</p>
            <p>After these parts so well plaid abroad, Let us consider how the design was carried on among our selves, from the fourth yeer of His Maj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> fraud; the first is, disapproved, probably upon these reasons:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The King could not be supposed to yeeld to an invasion of His own Kingdom, and it was pitie to betray so hopefull a Prince.</item>
               <item>2. It was more full of hazard, as subject to the Accidents of warre; as also, that a violent attempt would probably joyn the <hi>Prot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>stant</hi> and <hi>Puritan,</hi> against the <hi>Papist,</hi> whereas a frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent graduall proceeding might possibly unite the <hi>Papist,</hi> and <hi>Indifferent Protestant</hi> against the <hi>Puritan,</hi> which they have
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60987:6"/>
now accomplished. The latter way is resolved upon, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments accordingly fitted, which are certainly the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable requisites in any work.</item>
            </list>
            <p>And because it was of very great concernment, That the King should be brought to favour and further these Popish pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and preparations, He must be ingaged either upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious or politike considerations, to promote this <hi>Reconciliation</hi> with <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not to dispute how farre He was prevailed with in matters of Religion; if not for an absolute alteration, yet an Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; or whether<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ultimate End, and full Design, were discovered to Him, or rather He made to prosecute it under an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Notion: This is certain, That He manifestly favoured those Courses that made way for Popery and Tyranny; and it is to be conceived, rather with respect to power and profit (which were alwayes observed to be His Majesties well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent Interests) then to the Popish, or any other Religion, which is evidenced by that passage that fell from His Majesty, observed by the <hi>Venetian</hi> that wrote the Narrative, called the Popes <hi>Nuntio, sc. That His Majesty could at that time reconcile Himself to Rome with much advantage.</hi> And when it was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned that the Interest of absolute Rule, with its advantages, was so firmely setled in His Majesty, and that He was subject to be violent in the prosecution of it, and not likely to stumble at small blocks, which they might well ghesse by the dissolution of Parliaments, billeting Souldiers, the design of the <hi>German<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </hi> horse, &amp;c. They cherish him in it, and set <hi>France</hi> with its broken <hi>Parliaments</hi> and <hi>full</hi> power, as an Object of Emulation before him, as finding the Interests of Popery and Tyranny very well to agree.</p>
            <p>Now therefore, is His Majesty perswaded that His Crown, and the Popes Chair have common Friends, and common Enemies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Parliaments</hi> and <hi>Puritans,</hi> are their <hi>Enemies; Prelacy</hi> and <hi>Prophanenesse,</hi> their <hi>Friends.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us see how things were carried with respect to them all.</p>
            <p>First, For <hi>Parliaments,</hi> which the Popish Party knew
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60987:7"/>
to be very good advantages in their constitution, to the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and reformation of the Protestant Religion, they represent them to his Majesty as most disadvantagious to his desired pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and profit. These were onely times of recompence for wrong, of petitions for right, Controllers of Prerogative, Assertors of popular Liberty; and therefore are they dissolved, disgraced by scandalous Declarations, publikely aspersed both from the Presse an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> Pulpit, as by Doctor <hi>Alablaster, Beale, Manwaring,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of that stamp. And that there might be no occasion of drawing supplies of money that way, which had so many other Inconveniences attending it, severall exquisite Engines of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and oppression were found out by <hi>Weston, Noy,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as Loans, Patents, Ship-money, &amp;c. And thus for twelve years, or thereabouts, were Parliaments intermitted, and the hopes, if not remembrance, of them almost worn out.</p>
            <p>Then for <hi>Puritanes,</hi> men cordially Protestant and zealous of their own Religion, which no where but among us is a fault, because they were tenacious of just Liberty, and true Religion, how studiously and spightfully are they disgraced, as men of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonarchicall Principles, factious spirits, ranked with <hi>Iesuites</hi> (who were yet better used) as the Incendiaries of Churches and States. For the suppressing these men, the authority of the High Commission, Star-chamber, Bishops Courts, and the ordinary Courts of Justice, through the corruption of Judges and other inferiour Officers, were made very serviceable; and that they might have no shelter neerer then <hi>New-England,</hi> most of the faithfull Ministers, and religious Justices were for some pretence or other discountenanced, displaced; and it was grown to that passe, that <hi>he that departed from evill made himself a prey.</hi> For the rooting out of Ministers, whose onely fault was painfulnesse in their places, severall artifices were used: And because there were a sort of conformable Puritanes, whom the old Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies reached not (who were the least tolera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>le, because the least liable) severall Innovations, and that p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>stilent Declaration of the Sabbath, were introduced, which to oppose or refuse, was to be marked out to destruction. And all this done, that the Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as they called it, that so much hindered the <hi>good worke</hi> in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60987:7"/>
hand, this intended <hi>reconciliation,</hi> might be weakened, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.</p>
            <p>But were not the Cup in the hand of the Whore very stupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, it were impossible to make Princes so much mistake their friends for enemies. The Principles of Popery are certainly more propense to Treasons and Rebellions then those of the Protestant Religion, which alwayes made good <hi>Subjects,</hi> though not <hi>Slaves.</hi> And besides reason and experience of former Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, this present Conjuncture of time and affairs may give testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony therof. Suppose a Popish Prince that had broken the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall Contract bound with Oath, subverted the fundamentall Constitutions of government in this Kingdome (imagine by Parliaments) and gave evident testimony of not being firme to the established Religion; can it be conceived that such a one could enjoy any security in the midst of Romane Catholiques? Yet with us, after manifold oppressions, breaches of priviledge, intrenchments upon liberty, setting up of the Standard, which some would have interpreted a renouncing of the peoples pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, upon which their allegiance depends, casting off a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, by so late an Act made indissoluble, without their own consent, charging them with actuall Rebellion, and disclaiming all acts done by them, or right in them to exercise his or their own power: The King hears no other language then Gracious Soveraigne, Your sacred Maj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>sty, not onely in formall compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, but solemne Covenants. Let the world judge whether the challenged Power of the Pope, and the grounds of Popery, would not have given the Subjects an absolution, and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished proceedings upon other grounds then the Puritanes of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> yet do. Yet so farre, through the just judgements of God, have the intoxications of <hi>Rome,</hi> backed with continuall evill Councels, prevailed with His Majesty, as that it may be said justly of him as <hi>David,</hi> he loves his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and hates his friends, and prefers them who have plaid some of <hi>Absaloms</hi> tricks with him, to his most faithfull servants and people. It may be his Majesty is led by this Principle, That if he prevaile he gaines much, if not, he loseth nothing; onely is where he was: but this may prove a dec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>itfull arguing, if not
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60987:8"/>
prevented in time. That of the wise man may be peculiarly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to these Councels, so full of folly and hazard, <hi>The wicked worketh a deceitfull work.</hi> But pardon this digression, it was well meant, however it may be interpreted.</p>
            <p>So fared it with the <hi>Friends of Popery,</hi> the <hi>Prelates;</hi> who but they, must be the Kings Friends, <hi>Neal</hi> to King <hi>Iames, Laud</hi> to King <hi>Charles;</hi> and there they suborned a fraudulent Proverb to serve their turn, which was, <hi>No Bishop, no King,</hi> nay (in <hi>Sydenhams</hi> Rhetorick) <hi>no God,</hi> whereas the truth was, <hi>No Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, no Pope.</hi> And here again, was the King cheated by the Bishops, which will evidently appear, if ever (which God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid) these Cockatrice Eggs be hatched. In the mean time, let reason, and former experience be Judges. The pomp and splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of the Church, is the Popes proper Interest; to which, the greatnesse of Princes, is rather opposite, then subservient. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of power, was in the Negotiation, pretended for the King, intended for the Bishops, who onely made use of the Kings power, for the advancement of their own. And though the King might easily judge, that no <hi>addition</hi> of power could be in <hi>them,</hi> without a <hi>Diminution</hi> of <hi>His;</hi> yet so farre had this Circean Cup prevailed, that Bishops and their Agents, because they served the turn for the present, and prostituted their learning, power, and consciences, to the vindication of illegall Actions, and Authority, were entrusted, not onely with <hi>Ecclesiasticall,</hi> but a very great share in <hi>Civill</hi> affairs; some of them being of the Privy Councell, in all the three Kingdoms, and more especially the Archbishop of Saint <hi>Andrews, Chancellor of Scotland,</hi> the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury, Controller of the Councell in England,</hi> who, through the Kings confidence, and his own pragmatick disposition, had an influence upon all businesse of consequence that was transacted; And as the King presumed them his friends, so the Pope knew they were his own. Their function was a degree nearer in kindred to him, then any other Government of the Church, and the persons of some of them (as being men addicted to Superstition and Idolatry) were more serviceable then their Offices.</p>
            <p>And it is worth the observation, what care the Faction did
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60987:8"/>
take to keep this main out-work to Popery, in pressing their Calling upon mens consciences, which every body, unlesse some of their own Favourites, found so offensive in all other respects. And therefore, from the Pulpit and Presse, was their <hi>Ius divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> pleaded, as by others, so by the prostitute pen of D. <hi>Hall,</hi> who must also contribute his Mite towards this Reconciliation, by his Printed <hi>Reconciler,</hi> being a pennance enjoyned him for writing formerly, <hi>No peace with Rome.</hi> And lest their Rhetorick should fail, They took care in their <hi>Conclave</hi> (for it was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Synod, nor Convocation) held 1640. for the binding men to this Government by an Oath, so absolutely necessary to this work, was their standing justly thought to be.</p>
            <p>Lastly, Another Introduction made for the resignation of this Church and Kingdom into the bosome of <hi>Rome;</hi> was that <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance</hi> and <hi>Prophanenesse,</hi> which were generally countenanced in the Kingdom. That there was all means used for the growth of these <hi>Cardinall vertues</hi> is evidently manifest. As for <hi>Ignorance,</hi> how studiously did the Pharisaicall Prelates keep from the people the Key of knowledge, by disgracing and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenancing Preaching, silencing painfull Ministers, putting down Lectures, and when good men (willing to take any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to discharge their Consciences) in stead of Preaching, expounded the common Catechisme, in that they were restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Wrens</hi> Articles, and all discourse of Religion forbidden upon occasionall meetings. But I am sure, that is no Apostolike Rule, if Saint <hi>Paul</hi> be consulted, (<hi>Col.</hi> 3. 16.) for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Apostolike Sea, as it is called.</p>
            <p>The most of the Preaching that was allowed, was degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate into railing against Parliaments and Puritans, crying up ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute authority, passive obedience, strains of wit fitter for a Stage then a Pulpit. And that men might not be relieved from the <hi>Presse,</hi> where the <hi>Pulpit</hi> failed, some Superstitious, prophane Chaplains were set to be Overseers of it, to whom an <hi>Egyptian</hi> command was given, as to the Midwives there, to kill the Males in the birth; and not satisfied with that, as if one age were too narrow Limits for their iniquity to be exercised in, Order was given, for the Re-printing Books formerly licenced,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60987:9"/>
with their <hi>corrections,</hi> or rather <hi>corruptions,</hi> according to the Tridentine invention of <hi>Index expurgatorius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The like care was taken in matters of <hi>Prophanenesse;</hi> which, as if it had not been sufficiently provided for by <hi>Ignorance,</hi> the naturall mother of it, the Prelates by the examples of their own families for the most part, and the procuring and pressing the Book of licentiousnesse upon the Sabbath, were diligent Nurses thereof.</p>
            <p>And if it be further enquired, how these Twinnes became serviceable to Popery, the resolution is very cleer: <hi>Ignorance</hi> you know, is the mother of Popish Devotion, that is, Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a speciall qualification of a disciple of <hi>Rome,</hi> where <hi>blindfold</hi> is the onely <hi>play,</hi> a trick the Pope borrows from the Divell, <hi>The god of this world hath blinded their mindes,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. And so likewise Prophanenesse is a borderer upon Popery, by the loose Principles, of which, it is much countenanced. It is true, Some sins are not so good cheap, among them, as others, but all may be had at a reasonable rate. And prophane persons, whose remainders of Conscience tell them, they must at least pretend to some Religion, or other (unlesse they have arrived at the height of Atheism) readily pitch upon that next hand, which would allow most Liberty. And our present experience gives testimony of the service these two fruits of the Bishops Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment have done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Prophanenesse hath made a generall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versenesse to Reformation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Ignorance, with the help of that, hath furnished the King with an Army against the Parliament, fetcht from the barren Mountains of <hi>Wales, Cornewall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and the North, which were kept s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>re without the means of knowledge, as a fit reserve for such a time, as this. I speak of the common sort of souldiers, many of the rest have too much knowledge, and too little conscience.</p>
            <p>Thus have we an account of the more remote preparations for this <hi>great service,</hi> which had wrought so well, that it was thought seasonable to adventure more boldly upon the businesse. And the Prelats, with their forward dependants, as impatient of this dilatory proceeding begin to offer &amp; presse Popish innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to preach divers doctrines of grosse Popery, for the which I

And that <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi> might not stand idle, he dispatcht thither <hi>Chappell,</hi> and other such Agents who by their Arminianisme and Superstition, might traine up the ordinary sort of Protestants there, and bring them to that temper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that upon a difference they should propend rather to the Papists then the true Protestants; of which allay, <hi>Ormond,</hi> Canterburies Nursling, and his followers, now prove.

            <p>When therefore it was resolved that the many humble Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Remonstrances of the Scottish Nation should be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered in blood, preparations are accordingly made; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Bishops had rendered themselves so odious by their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious and Lordly carriage, though the quarrell was theirs, the action must be entred in the Kings name the warre must be called <hi>Bellum Ragale,</hi> and not <hi>Episcopale,</hi> and the Scots perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, not as men dis-affected to <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> but to <hi>Monarchy.</hi> And thus, by blowing the Trumpet of Lyes and Slanders, some desperate, some deluded persons were gathered together, to force the Scottish Nation to <hi>Canonicall</hi> obedience, and a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity</hi> to England, now in <hi>Confederacie</hi> with Rome. His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties person for the credit of the Cause must be ingaged, who comming downe to the Borders, and finding the Scots standing upon their defence at Dunce hill, the King having left his fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands at home, in stead of fighting treats and concludes a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification at <hi>Berwicke;</hi> which when the Councellours of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, especially <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>Strafford,</hi> saw, as they had before incensed his Majesty against his people to now (as became the Grace of the one, and Lordship of the other) they make him fall out with himselfe, and his owne act, and sacrifice his faith and honour to the Quarrell. This poore paper, because it gave advantage toward a peace, so unsatisfying to them, and unser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to their ends, it must receive the measure more due to the Incendaries, be dis-avowed, and burnt by the hands of the Hangman.</p>
            <p>And this was done upon these or the like considerations. If Scotland be so left, it will not onely be hopelesse in regard of it selfe, and so hinder the perfection of the good worke, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine as an ill president to all good Subjects to stand up in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of their Religion and Liberties, (which <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>Strafford</hi> had a mind to invade) against all illegall and violent

            <p>The successe of this designe being ill, and the experce great and insupportable to the Contrivers, notwithstanding all their extravagant oppressions, they are so impudent as to try if they could intitle the English <hi>Nation</hi> to the maintenance a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Hereupon the Instruments of violence double their diligent injustice, which grew so intolerable, that some of the Lords take the confidence to petition the King who being betwixt the <hi>Scylla</hi> of a Northerne Army, and the <hi>Charibdis</hi> of a Southerne petition, yeelded to a second parliament, yet continued, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into a Treaty with the Scots, being out of hopes of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther End, unlesse it were of his men and money.</p>

            <p>And not to let this businesse passe without the just honour and vindication of the Scottish Nation, let the world take notice, that they not onely refused this offer, but acquainted those who were most entrusted with the affaires of the English Parliament, and offered rather (if need were) their best assistance to secure the just and lawfull proceedings and priviledges of Parliament, and settle both Nations in truth and peace, the embracing whereof might have probably prevented a great deale of bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> and had beene the <hi>Fore-game</hi> of our present <hi>After-game.</hi> But they were then so farre more tender of his Majesties honour then their owne safety. that they made use neither of the Kings offer to the Scots by declaring it, nor the Scots to them by accepting it, and one of them was so farre more ambitious of his Majesties favour then carefull of his owne honour, as to acquaint the King with the businesse: A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>But I hasten from this Digression, and returne to that conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, which I thinke I may clearely make from these premises; That his Majesty before any of these apparent Quarrels about Tumules, or the like, used earnest endeavours for destroying the Parliament, so contrary both in its constitution and proceedings
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60987:14"/>
to the intended subversion of Religion and Liberty, either in their persons or priviledges.</p>
            <p>So that though these plots and transactions did not serve the Kings turn, for the intended mischiefe, yet they serve mine very well in the cleare proofe of the intention of the mischiefe.

When therfore the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies raised both in England and Ireland (not without some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustancy, as not having performed their intended service) were unavoidably to be dis-banded in the declining part of the yeare 1641. we must suppose a <hi>Counsell</hi> most solemnly to be called at <hi>White-hall</hi> about July or August, before the Kings going into <hi>Scotland</hi> (it being then very seasonable in regard that the <hi>Irish</hi> Committee (especially so able and active men as <hi>Gormonston, Muskery, Plunket, Browne</hi> and <hi>Bourke,</hi> who were privately treated with) was then in <hi>England</hi>) wherein, as may appeare by the precedent and future practises, it was laid as a ground, That this <hi>Parliament,</hi> with the <hi>Puritanes,</hi> their Adherents, who stood so obstinately in the way of this propounded, and so farre promoted Designe, must be removed, or subdned.

            <p>After the Proposition of the destroying this Parliament, in case it could not be reduced to the service of this Catholique De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe, (which was almost past hope, seeing no more royall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations in them, after so many Acts of Grace, besides perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall honours, and offers made to some, accepted by others) which was resolved doubrlesse, <hi>nemine contradicente.</hi> The next consultation must naturally and necessarily be of the manner, which must likewise be Confusion and Blood; <hi>sceleribus non nisi per scelera tutum est iter.</hi>

            <p>But nothing is to be done rashly, the Cause being as full of hazard as importance; let therefore the State of the Kingdome of England, and the neighbour Kingdomes and States, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to this Cause be duly considered.</p>
            <p>The condition of England may be thus represented, for the body of it; It consists of <hi>Papists, Protestants, viz.</hi> the King, Prelates, Courtiers, and Cavaliers. the dissolute Gentry, the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious Clergy, the profane and ignorant people the only Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants now accounted of, all the rest are but Anabaptists and Brownists; and a third party of <hi>Purita is</hi> that is Lovers of the Protestant Religion, with the desire of Reformatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

by a late act, would be a very great impediment, in regard of its power and estimation with the people, especially now after their pressures sustained for want of Parliaments.</p>
            <p>This was put of with the projects of defaming and disgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, withdrawing some of the Members, corrupting others, and bringing the Kingdome into that condition that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment shall be constrained to disingage the people by requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Contribution, rather then ingage them by present freedome and reformation. <hi>England</hi> thus represented is no great discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to the worke.</p>

            <p>Things being thus digested (as in all reason they might and were) no wonder though the King upon his returne from <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and the Rebellion begunne in <hi>Ireland,</hi> altered his language and carriage to the Parliament, and sought nothing more then

occasions of beginning the Quarrell; as by the illegall accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their members, Going to the house of Commons to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them, so attended; upon whose instigation, and with what intention, appeares by the Queenes carriage at his frustrate returne, as also by the confessions of divers of that desperate Guard. These violent assassinating courses attempted in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> practised in <hi>Ireland,</hi> though they are not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Evidences, are usuall signes of a Popish Designe, and Jesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iticall Councels.</p>
            <p>After this attempt, (not through pretended feare, (for his Majesty adventured into the City the next day, with a small Guard) but through indignation at the disappointed mischiefe, and, (as the Lord <hi>Digbie</hi> saith) to keepe the Cavaliers from trampling and reproach,) the King removes from London, <hi>cum tota sequela,</hi> except some who were left to be Agents in City and Parliament for this great service, whom we could as well have spared.</p>

            <p>In the meane while the King is going on pilgrimage in Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to this Romish Cause, and though continually petitioned for returne, and obtested by bleeding <hi>Ireland,</hi> makes little stay till he comes to <hi>York,</hi> where after the Courting of that Country, and his many Protestations, (taking the Lords in for securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>Iune</hi> 15. 1642. whose honours were pawned for his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties intentions whereby it was thought the people were better prepared then indeed they were) he goes to <hi>Hull,</hi> and upon Sit <hi>Iohn Hothams</hi> refusall takes occasion to raise a <hi>Guard</hi> for his

            <p>But what is all this to the subversion of the Protestant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if there had been any such intention in the raising the Army, the <hi>Papists</hi> whose speciall interest it was, should have beene ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in, who are by a Proclamation dated at <hi>York,</hi> August 10. 1642. forbidden, not onely the Court, (a place so unfit for them, the Queen being now absent) but any Office or service in the Kings Army; and as if his Majesty were so farre from expecting their <hi>assistance,</hi> that he feared their <hi>vengeance,</hi> in his instructions to the Commissioners of Array, August 29. 1642. dated at <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham,</hi> charge is given that Recusants be disarmed.</p>
            <p>This cannot be <hi>denied,</hi> but it may be <hi>contradicted,</hi> as it was by his Majesty, in an answer to the Petition of the Recusants of <hi>Lancashire,</hi> dated at <hi>Chester,</hi> September 27. 1642. where they are not onely allowed, but (according to the knowne Law of the Land) required to provide sufficient armes, for themselves, their servants, and tennants.</p>
            <p>And wheras it may be said the case was different in August and September; its yeelded, his Majesties <hi>Case</hi> was different, though his <hi>Cause</hi> the same. To have received them before others were ingaged, had beene to disingage the <hi>Protestants</hi> and interrupt the worke in its tender beginnings.

then Popery) I purposely omit: onely let me take notice, that this worke of darknesse hath made the darke corners of the land its refuge and received most assistance from places most void of the knowledge of God, which we are in a high degree to impute to the more then barbarous cruelty of the Prelats not onely not providing, but preventing their supplies, and discouraging the Liberality and Piety of those who indeavoured the propagation of the Gospel, by disappointing the intention of buying in Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriations, and discountenancing Lecture.</p>
            <p>These Armies thus raised, and made up by Papists prelats, Courtiers, superstitious Clergy-men, dissolute Gentry, and a Herd of prophane ignorant people; what by treating and fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by false friends and bitter enemies (though the just hand of God upon this Nation, for their idolatry, and backsliding bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed and oppression, and undervaluing the precious Gospell of Jesus Christ) have turned this Kingdome into a Field of bloud, and of the esteem and envie of other Nations, have made it the pitty of our few friends, and the reproach of our adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries.</p>

Psa.</hi> 44. But what peace so long as, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>There were possibly some Lords and Gentlemen (in other respects) of worth, as <hi>Hartford, South hampton, Falkland,</hi> and some others, (who finding things contrary to their expectation, and being wearied with the tediousnesse of this unnaturall war) that had and have reall inclinations to peace: but what doth this availe us, when his Majesty is wholly swayed by those Counsels which are as averse to peace, as to the Protestant Religion, and the Liberties of the Kingdom; so that there is little hope that the Armes taken up by the King should be willingly laid down, till the ends for which they were raised, the subduing the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament and Puritans, the subversion of Religion and Liberty, (which God prevent) be accomplished.</p>
            <p>But I am not ignorant of the prejudice and unbeliefe that all which hath been or can be said in this businesse is like to meet with, so averse are men from looking upon this as a Quarrell of Religion, and from laying it to heart accordingly. I shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take the boldnesse to produce yet some further Evidence, whereby it may appeare that the Interests of the King and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists as in all parts, so particularly in <hi>Ireland,</hi> are deeply and desperately involved.</p>
            <p>First in generall, the Papists (who do not use to reckon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60987:18"/>
their Host) in all places interpret the Cause of the King a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Parliament to be their owne, and declare it not only in words, but in their personall assistance, and plentifull Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions, as appears by the notice given to the Papists in Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, of the acceptable service they should doe to the Catholike Cause, by sending money for the maintenance of the Army a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Parliament, witnessed upon Oath. And though our selves who are most nearly concerned are so hard of beliefe in this Case, yet the neighbour Protestants, as of Zeland and Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, do so state it, as appeares by the Letter of solicitation for a seasonable engagement in the behalf of the English Protestants, from Zeland to the Generall Assembly of Scotland, and by the Remonstrance of the Assembly of Scotland, to the Convention of Estates there, and their answer thereunto, dated June 27. Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 4. 1643.</p>
            <p>But the fullest and saddest Evidence in this businesse is to be drawn from the due examination, and consideration of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion in Ireland, (for so it was once called) wherin there have perished neare two hundred thousand soules, by the hands of those wicked and detestable Rebels (as they are called by his Majesty in his Declaration of April the 8. 1642.) so odious to God and all good men, with whom if his Majesties Counsels prove consederate, I think it will be sufficient to convince our moderate men, and awake them out of that Neutrality, which is as unprofitable as it is detestable, since it neither procures friends, nor reconciles enemies.</p>
            <p>That the ground of that Rebellion was the advancement of the Catholike Cause, is professedly declared by the Acts of the Generall Assembly of Rebels at Kilkenny, held 1642. which Acts were printed at London, March the sixth 1643. in these words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>FOR the exaltation therefore of the Holy Romane Catholike Church, for the advancement of his Majesties service, and for the preservation of the Lives, Estates and Liberties of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties true Subjects of this Kingdome, against the injustice, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi>

The said Assembly doth order and establish a Councell by the name of a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame Councell, of the confederate Catholiques of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>You see how neare the <hi>Exaltation of the holy Romane Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church, and the advancement of his Majesties service,</hi> stand together, and who are accounted his Majesties true Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, who Malignants. But all this is easily blasted with the Consideration that they are the Expressions of Rebels, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Majesties name and service for their advantage; No, under favour, they are the expressions of his <hi>Roman Catholique Subjects,</hi> so stiled in the late <hi>Cessation,</hi> concluded in his Majesties name, and by his Majesties authority, September 15. 1643. and ranked equally with other his Majesties good Subjects, and therefore no reason to discountenance this Evidence, not yet those of the like nature hereafter to be produced. However it aboundantly shewes the end for which it was mentioned, the proving that Rebellion to be a Quarrell of Religion.</p>
            <p>Let us now trie what Evidence may be brought forth to prove that the Papists in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Armies in <hi>England,</hi> engaged against the Parliament, are doing the same work, and that there is a line of Communication betwixt their Counsells. To this purpose, let us consider a <hi>Commission,</hi> and a <hi>Cessation,</hi> to which whatsoever else is to be said in this matter may be reduced.</p>
            <p>Common fame, none of the worst witnesses, hath brought to every mans eares the noyse of the Kings favouring the Irish <hi>Massacre,</hi> and that the Catholique Subjects there have called themselves the Queenes Army, and intimated themselves the

Kings, by saying they had good warrant in black and white for their proceedings, and crying out upon the English Parliament and Puritanes, as the Kings Enemies and theirs. It were well worth the knowing the truth of this so important businesse. Let us goe as neare it as the nature of a Mystery will admit.</p>
            <p>And first let the Copy of the <hi>Commission,</hi> said to be given by the King to his Catholique Subjects of Ireland, be read and examined.</p>

            </p>
            <p>This last clause I take for granted, but as for the rest, give me leave to try whether the inside or the outside of my paper be the tiuer. And this I shall doe with all due respect both to the King and Parliament, that his Majesty may see that there was some fire in the midst of all the smoak, and that the jealousies of his people, concerning the Irish businesse, were not altogether groundlesse; as also that the King may have a sit occasion to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ure this Commission, and cleare himselfe of the aspersions cast upon him, with respect thereto, and chastise (as his Majesties phrase is) those wicked fellows (but I crave mercy, they are not my fellows, they are owned Subjects, but I, and the rest of the Parliaments friends proclaimed Rebels) And that the more full and particular satisfaction may be given (for discourses and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations will not be taken any longer for payment) I shall give all the Arguments I can to prove the reality of it.</p>
            <p>First therefore let us consider the time (a materiall circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance) when this Commission is dated that is the first of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 1641. in one copy, and the fourth in another, (no great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference) the <hi>Massacre</hi> beginning the 23. of the same month, which was presently after the Conferences at <hi>White-hall</hi> with the Lord <hi>Muskerie</hi> and his fellows, who returned into <hi>Ireland</hi> the same month his Majesty went for <hi>Scotland,</hi> leaving the Lord <hi>Dillon,</hi> who was presently after sent with the Queenes Letters, requesting or requiring his being made Counsellor of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to his Majesty then at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where it is said this Commission was signed with the broad Seal of that Kingdome, being not then setled in the hands of any Officer who could be answerable for the use of it, but during the vacancy of the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors

place, intmsted with <hi>Marquesse Hammilton,</hi> and by him with one master <hi>Iohn Hammilton,</hi> the Scribe to the Crosse Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and sometimes under the care of master <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimion Porter;</hi> a very fit opportunity for such a clandestine trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action. And let it not be omitted, that presently after the date of this Commission, <hi>Dillon, Butler,</hi> and divers other Irish Commanders, of which the Court was then full, were dispat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched for <hi>Ireland</hi> by his Majesties Licence, not without the just suspition of By-standers.</p>
            <p>The Commission it selfe, for the grounds and language of it, is very suitable to other dispatches and writings under his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties name, expressing much bittemesse against the Parliament, and jealousie of the diminution of his Prerogative, which was alwayes his great feare. But I shall be unwilling to fetch the least proofe from the matter or stile of the Commission the Argument is not so beggarly as to necessitate a <hi>Petitio Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipii.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us go on to examine the grounds, why such a thing should be forged, and why such a thing should be granted, and see which are the more probable.</p>
            <p>I know no ground why such a Commission should be forged. It was not to make his Majesty odious, for in all their writings they expresse all tendernesse of his honour, and forwardnesse of their obedience particularly in the forementioned Assembly at <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenny,</hi> where, next after the Article for the injoyment of all the Priviledges and Immunities of the Romane Church, as in the ninth yeare of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, the Oath of Allegiance to his Majesty is established, (its likely according to the agreement of the Reconciliation with a <hi>Salvo</hi> to the Sea of Rome) and their constant and generall professions of loyalty (now so well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by his Majesties expressions to them, and their contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to him) do clearly evince, that they had not so much ill will to the King, as to raise such a scandall of him. And more especially, though a Commission might do them some advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, yet the forgery of one could not but be prejudiciall, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a necessary ingagement of his Majesty in his owne justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to have used the utmost of his skill and power against them,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60987:21"/>
as to have staid with his Parliament and prevented a war in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> But though a forged Commission might be unprofitable, yet a reall one I wonder not should be demanded though a stranger to the <hi>Mystery</hi> would wonder it should be granted.</p>
            <p>First, that hereby the King, whom they knew in his own dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position apt enough to start from his Expressions upon an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, might be firmly bound to them and their proceedings, as also that the more backward Papists, who were more good natured then to rebell against a King whom they had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ound so propitious, and more wary, then by such Rebellion to forfeit their Estates, which under him, with the advantage of their Religion, they doubted not to enjoy, might the more easily be brought in.</p>
            <p>If it be objected, this might be done by a forged Commission<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I answer, not so well; Forgery is an unruly help, being often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited with the double hinderance of a discovery. Papists, though sometimes they delude us, they deale freely, especially in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Catholique Cause, with one another. And what end such fraud could have upon the Protestants, unlesse a little to amaze them at first, &amp; then exasperate them, I cannot conceive. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is, be assured that <hi>Oneale</hi> and <hi>Mac-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> Proclamation.</p>
            <p>The Proclamation it selfe though in its nature opposite yee in its time and circumstances was too suitable to the Commission, being deferred from the latter end of October to the first of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary, and then so sparingly printed, so warily published, as if it had been under the controll of some former Act whose leave must first be craved. But his Majesty hath reason to expresse vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence against these his Catholike Subjects, or to chastise them at least, for they went beyond this Commission, though supposed reall; that gave but a Yard, they took an Ell: though they were allowed to sei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>le the private Letters concomitant can help out at such a pinch) and their very transgression in this matter might justly occasion and provoke the title of mercilesse wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Rebels. But to return to Actions, the best Commentaries upon words; it is to be feared they will be found more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Commission then the Proclamation, as may be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the unanswered <hi>Remonstrance of the rise and progresse</hi>

               <hi>of the Grand Rebellion in Ireland.</hi> For instance, What shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different men think of his Majesties withdrawing himself from his Parliament, declared by the then reall, though now preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Parliament, to be a great obstruction to the prosperity of the Irish undertakings? Of his raising war against his Subjects here, the greatest service that could be done to the pretended re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels there, being a diversion of that strength, and a distraction of those Counsels that should have suppressed them? Of his granting passes for notorious Papists, as <hi>Butler,</hi> the sons of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The stopping of provisions going to the supply of the Army against them taking away the horses prepared by the E. of <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester</hi> for that service, as appears by his complaint in a printed letter to the Earl of <hi>Northumberlana?</hi> Of the free accesse of those that have been active in that Design to his Majesties camp and Court? Of his putting in demu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>res to the Bill of pressing souldiers, and deniall to the sending ships for that service?</p>
            <p>It must not be denied that his Majesty was earnest in pressing care of that businesse of Ireland upon the Houses, and passed some things to the advantage of it, and (in a message of the 8. of April 1642.) spared not to offer his going in person to <hi>chastise</hi> those wicked and detestable Rebels, with the renouncing of all other Ends, (but if his Majesty had continued in that angry minde, hee might with ease have chastised them, when they came over to him, as they have done <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ince plentifully.) I wish I had many more such actions to repeat. But it must be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, there was a Proclamation that required some countenance, and could not well have lesse then it had: but I forestall no mans judgement, but leave the impartiall reader to the weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what hath been said, and what hath been produced upon Oath in the Declaration of the Commons, Iuly 25. 1643. And if the ballance be equall, I shall only cast in some scruples of the late Cessation, which, unlesse the beame be false, will make the Commission weigh down the Proclamation.</p>
            <p>1. First the scruple of &amp;c. in the nomination of the parties in this Treaty. Is his Majesties Title of Defender of the Faith

            </p>
            <p>2. The scruple of their sudden transformation from mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous mercilesse <hi>Rebells</hi> into <hi>Subjects</hi> conj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But yet, <hi>Mopso Nisa datur quid non speremus,</hi> &amp;c. His Majesty sure had thoughts of this dishonourable recancation, when hee was so loth to publish the Proclamation against them.</p>
            <p>3. The third scruple is <hi>

            <p>But seeing the discovery and foresight of mischief is but half a wise mans work, (which now every body pretends to, and I for company) Let us study in a few words to declare the best Rules of prevention to this Inundation of Tyranny and Popery, which from the Romish Sea is like to overwhelm us; <hi>The pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Many rules both of Piety and Policy might be laid down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the grounds of Scripture, Reason, and Experience. But since the most of them are so well summed up in that solemne League and Covenant agreed on and entred into by these two Nations of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland;</hi> I will not scatter them, but propound the deliberate Entrance into that Covenant, and the faithfull pursuance thereof to be the most Religious and reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable way, to unite and strengthen the too much divided party of true Protestants against these Conspiracies discovered, which are likely yet further to enlarge their bounds.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:60987:25"/>Let none of us go about to deceive our selves with unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Treaties, or hopes of a yet impossible Accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but cheerfully and faithfully accomplish a speedie and firm Union with the Councels and strength of Scotland (which will encourage not onely religious but wise men to joyn with us) it being beyond a reasonable expectation that by our own strength or wisdom we should extricate our selves from this growing calamity in which we are daily more and more involved. It now becomes every man to wind up his thoughts to a Christian resolution befitting the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent necessities and Condition of the Church of God, and walk worthy of it, and let the Lord do what seemeth good unto him.</p>
            <p>I might now make my self a great deal of more work, and create some trouble to my Reader, if I should after this sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction I have given to my own heart and the friends of this Cause of Religion, go about to satisfie the world, and answer their severall quarrels with this undertaking, but I will be more mercifull to the Reader, and more just to my self then to accuse my self by excuses. Onely I will give you a taste of that which I am like to have plenty.</p>
            <p>The first Question will be <hi>Who is this?</hi> I answer, it matters not who, but what. The next is a position, <hi>Sure he was a mad-man thus to provoke Maiesty it self, did he ever learn that verse in Homer.</hi>

            <p>Yes but he hath, and that in <hi>Iob</hi> too. In such a cause as this, let me not I pray you accept any mans person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man. I hope to see the day when I shall be accounted a better subject to the King then he that accuses me. In the meane time I am satisfied with being a good subject to the Kingdom, &amp; no Traitor to the Church. If I have incurred any danger, it is to shew thee thine, if a good Protestant. <hi>But there need not have been so much bitternesse used which often disadvantages a good Cause?</hi> It is the language of the times, and not mine. A filthy ulcer must have a sharpe lance; the massacre of Ireland is a bitter cup. <hi>Quis temperet invectivis? Here are many things produced in this Treatise that</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:60987:26"/>
               <hi>are but slender proofs?</hi> Then take them altogether. <hi>Altogether are but a rap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>idy scraped up out of the Parliament Declarations, and such scandalous pamphlets, as Plain English, and the English Pope?</hi> Truth is a common inheritance, and now so scarse that I was glad to take it where I could find it. <hi>Tush I can tell mrre of these affairs then this Discoverer?</hi> Then tell them, or tell me, and I will. But <hi>Mercurius Aulicus</hi> will be sure to meet with you? This is no time to be afraid of Court <hi>Bull Beggers,</hi> but if he meet with me he must go out of his way: I tell truth, he tels lies.</p>
            <p>But I have now done; and it may be done that which hath provoked almost every body, but my own conscience, which witnesses with me that I have not written any willing or negligent falshood, nor (to my best understanding) any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable or unnecessary truth. There is no man but will stand in need of some charity, I shall find it from them that have it; from those that have it not, I will not expect it. There are other <hi>Mysteries</hi> in this world of <hi>Iniquitie,</hi> carried on by them who under the pretence of Service do the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est dis-service and dishonour to the Cause of Religion and Liberty, which must either be amended or not concealed: let other men do their share, as I have done mine, and the world will certainly be either honester or wiser.</p>
            <p>This Discourse cannot be better concluded then with that which is the earnest and constant request of the Author to the Lord God of Hosts, the God of Israel, that seeing wisdom and might are his, he would vouchsafe wisdom to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors, courage and constancy to the Souldiers, willingnesse to the people, and faithfulnes to all those that have or shall engage themselves in this great Cause so infinitely valuable beyond the estates and lives of all that undertake it. To him be glory, and peace upon Israel.</p>
