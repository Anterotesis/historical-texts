         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y dear hearts all and everyone of you, whether high
or low, rich or poor, bond or free: I am a creature
and one of your fellow-Creatures, forced to ſend
unto you a ſmal mite, which I have had through
the ſpeakings of my infinite father in me, which
ſpeakings in me have bin ſo burning hot and ſo powerful, that I
have not bin able to reſist as for to keep them in ſecret, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
things which in this treatiſe I treat of, I have ſeen them
as being taken in a trance and lying for dead about 22 houres:
for the moſt part of them which in this following diſcourſe, I
had made out to me being in that condition, and aſſoon as I
had ſeen and heard of them and they were over, ſo that I had no
other at that time, I was forced to write them, it being the
good pleaſure of my father for to make choice of me ſo poor and
and unable a diſpiſed inſtrument, for to reveal and make known
ſuch things as ſhal ſurely come to paſs, as concerning the Level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of that which men for the preſent call their own, and ſo
hord up riches and treaſures here on earth for to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
great and to be applauded of men, forgetting the exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Jeſus Chriſt, who bid them lay up treaſures in heaven
and not here on earth: for the laying up treaſures here on earth
Chriſt ſaid the ruſt would take it: which the Apostle James
ſaies plainly to ſuch men that have horded up gold and ſilver,
even the very ruſt of it will riſe up in judgement againſt them:
looke to your ſelves, here is the laſt vial to be poured forth,
made mention of for to give you warning of your ſelves, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the day of the Lord is at hand, he is coming to take ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
on all his enemies, and for to confound you all that have
<pb facs="tcp:52339:3"/>
bundance of treaſures here on earth, and have laid up none in
heaven, nay it ſeems to be an unpoſſible thing for a rich man to
go into the kingdome of heaven; for ſaith Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>it is eaſier
for a camel to go through the eye of an needle, then for a
rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven:</hi> O you rich
men, what ſay you to theſe words? do you think to go to heaven,
when the ruſt of your ſilver wil riſe up in judgement againſt you?
you had more need throw away your riches here, and give them
to the poor; that the crying of the poor might no longer come into
my ear, ſaith the Lord, for their ſakes do I come to take ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
on ſuch hypocrites as you are, becauſe you have formes
of Godlyneſs, but deny the power thereof, you would fain ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to be holy, but yet you would be loth to part from that which
is the greateſt enemie of you, as the Apostle ſaies, men covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after riches have erred from the faith, and ſo have peirced
themſelves through many ſorrows: but that this may no longer
trouble you and keep you from coming to me, I will ſhew my ſelf
for the poors ſake, when you through the hardneſs of your hearts
have rather ſeen them ſtarve for want of food then give them a
peice of bread, yea though they cry for the Lord ſake give me a
peice of bread: when as all things are the Lords, and the Lord
comes; he comes, what to do? he comes to bring down the pride
and haughty lookes of men; what pride and haughty lookes?
even ſuch pride and haughty looks that ſcorne their fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatures,
even that muſt be brought down, even all their glory,
and honour too, even that glory wherein you have gloried, and
boaſted your ſelves: as becauſe of your riches you have thought
your ſelves better then others; and muſt have your fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
in bondage to you, and they muſt ſerve you, as to work for
you, and moyl and toyle for you, standing cap in hand to you, and
muſt not diſpleaſe you, no by no meanes; but alas, what are you
now I come, ſaith the Lord? for I tell you that the Lord of hoſt
comes with fire and ſword for to bring down your pride, and your
glory and honour, and all theſe things that you have lifted up
<pb facs="tcp:52339:3"/>
your ſelves with, &amp; have thought your ſelves better then the reſt,
I ſay he comes to plague you, torment you, and ſo to make you wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of your idols which you have made to your ſelves, for I muſt
tell thee, and it wil prove very true, that the mighty God of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob
is at hand, and will come of a ſudden when thou art not a
ware of, even that mighty Leveller, for to Levell and lay moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
and hils low, even you that are richer and greater then
your fellow creatures, even as low as my may be, and ſo will make
all equal with the plaines; for it is but juſt for him to do ſo, ſeeing
thou fat ſwine of the earth, whatſoever thou haſt is not thine
own, but it is all the Lords; and though it hath bin his pleaſure
for to beſtow riches on thee, and ſo have let you uſurpe authority
over them, yet now the Lords is at hand, that he will call you.
to an account, and finding you to be unjust ſtewards, he will put
you out of your stewardſhip, and then you muſt no longer uſurpe,
but ſhal be glad to be fellows with them whom now yee diſpiſe &amp;
hate, and cannot abide to let them be in your ſight; though this
may ſeem ſtrange to you and you will not believe it, yet it is the
Lords pleaſure that I ſhould ſend it forth to the publick view,
there being ſome that will conſider theſe things before hand, &amp;
ſo be made for to go before in this manner, as to count nothing
their own, and this they do with joy; when you that are obſtinate,
&amp; will not believe the ſtrange work which the Lord did ſpeak by
his prophets along time before this, &amp; that new thing ſhall be
done which people ſhal little think of, as I wil do a new work,
which the prophets point at, even that the Lord ſhould make you
throw away that which you do ſo much hug and look after, even
the gold and ſilver which you make Idols of: but whether you wil
or no, remember that it is the Lords pleaſure to ſend you this, as a
thing to ſcourge you, yea a very strange thing it is like it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to you, but read on &amp; fear not, but that the Lord of hoſt who
cauſed me to write this, wil in his own time (when he ſees you to
be in ſecurity and peace, crying peace to your ſelves) break in
like a mighty man, and confound you of a ſudden; for it is his
<pb facs="tcp:52339:4"/>
pleaſure to deale harſhly with you, and make you weary of your
ſelves, that ſo he may bring you through the fire to himſelf; and
make you to glory in himſelf, &amp; not in any thing elſe beſide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
for many reaſons why the Lord ſhould do this may be ſhown.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that the people may underſtand the Lord of hoſt is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecter
of perſons, as to give liberty to ſome more then to others,
in reſpect of thoſe things that be neceſſary to the body, which was
all made for the uſe of man, and that man ſhould have the benefit
of them all, which man hath a long time bin deprived of the
uſe of theſe outward things, as riches which other do injoy; and
therefore ſeeing it was the pleaſure of the Father at the firſt, for
to give to the creature man, an equall priviledge to all a like,
and not made man to be Lord over ſome part of the creation,
and the other part of the creation be in ſubjection to ſome other
man, no, but made man Lord over all, and that all were made
for the uſe of man; it is therefore no reaſon that man ſhould be
kept in bondage, as now they are, but that the juſt Lord who is
in the midſt of us, may ſhew his power for to reſtore his creature
man from the bondage they are now in, and ſo make man know
that he was made a Lord over all other creatures, and ſo now
ſhal once again by my power ſaith the Lord be brought for to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
the whole work of my hands, and ſo ſhal freely enjoy the
whole creation without let or hinderance, in this day wherein
I will make them free from the power of man, and ſo will bring
man to be fellows one with the other, and not Lords over one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
as they have bin and are now.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is time for the Lord to appear in this way for to
ſoften the hearts of men, who are ſo cruel grown one to the other,
as if they were not all of one mold or mettle, what is the reaſon
men are ſo hardened one againſt another, but by reaſon of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
intereſts which ſome have, and having more of their own
as they cal, it then others, their hearts are puſſed up with pride,
and ſo no longer wil they be fellowes, but maſters and Lords o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the reſt, and ſo ingroſs more and more into their hands,
<pb facs="tcp:52339:4"/>
by craftineſs, until ſuch time they get their deſires, and when
they have got their deſires in ſome reſpect, they cannot reſt ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
but wil ſtil proceed on in cruelty, and in making the reſt
of their fellow creatures their ſlaves, which is abomination to the
Lord that they ſhould do ſo, that they ſhould injoy the works of
the Lord in full, and have their fill, and wil not give to their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
creatures any bread, yea though they beg for the Lords ſake
for a peice of bread, yet they are ſo cruel as they wil not beſtow
any thing upon them, but many poor creatures dies for want of
bread, thus cruelly they deal with their fellow creatures; which
the Lord of host wil not ſuffer long to be, for they have hardned
their hearts, and have made them as hard as a ſtone, but the
Lord will ſoften your hearts, and make you know that you have
dealt cruelly with your fellow-creatures and have raigned over
them, but you ſhal now no longer raign in pompe, but you ſhal be
brought to ſee by the power of the Lord of hoſt, if you conſider
theſe Scriptures which are at the beginning of ſeverall viſions,
you ſhall ſee and know that you are as far off from fulfilling the
Scriptures by your cruelty, and that you may ſee you break them
dayly for exerciſing ſo much cruelty as you do, which on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
if you did fulfil them, you would freely give to them that
have need of them.</p>
            <p>And Reader, I do hereby minde you of the other part, which
I have not writ as my judgement, but by the ſpeaking of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to me, as concerning the Jewes, even thoſe that were Jewes
by nature, and are now diſperſed abroad among the Gentiles,
how that it is the good pleaſure of my Father, who is infinite in
himſelf, for to bring home his own people into his own light,
and ſo to make them ſee that Jeſus whom their fathers crucified,
was the King of the Iewes, notwithſtanding they could not at
that time believe it, yet now through his almighty power which
he will manifeſt by his ſtrong and powerful hand, make them
know that they have crucified their king, for which cauſe they
have bin diſperſed abroad in the nations; but now the father of
<pb facs="tcp:52339:5"/>
love who is infinite of himſelf, will in love bring home thoſe, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the Jewes, and make them his ſpouſe and choiſe Jewels, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the Gentiles whom he will bring out of their countrey
both out of miſticall and literall Babylon, into their own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
even into the land of Canaan, a land of reſt; whom the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath appointed to be in Judea, even to make the Materiall
City which the Jews formerly did inhabite, the praiſe of the whole
earth, and the people that ſhall be gathered thither, to be his
choice Iewes, and his wife; which ſpouſe and wife ſhall conſiſt of
all his choſen ones, whom he will bring up into his glory, both
Iewes and Gentiles; and how it will be his pleaſure for to make o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
be quiet, and ly in peace, and will not let them come to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb
them, but will confound and plague them terribly, with
ſuch a blow that ſhall make them amazed, ſo that they ſhall not
know what to do, but ſhall be glad, yea they ſhall think themſelves
happy if they can be at quiet and ly down in rest; for the power
of the mighty God of Iacob, even the infinite Iehovah ſhall be
ſeen to be amongst them, ſo (that they even the Iewes) ſhall not
need to be afraid of any, but they ſhall ly down in peace and take
their reſt, and none ſhall make them afraid; this will be the
ſtate and condition of Sion, that ſhall be gathered together to the
city Ieruſalem; glory and light ſhal ſhine upon them, when dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
ſhall cover the earth.</p>
            <p>Curteous Reader, let not the strangeneſs of theſe things make
thee hard to believe, that ſuch things as are here mentioned
ſhall come to paſs, by the rudeneſs of theſe lines having no elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
termes to ſet them forth, and by reaſon of the weakneſs or
contemptibleneſs of the writer of this peece, which muſt prove
a torment and a fire to burn and torment the gods of the earth,
and every thing that hath bin Idolized of or by men, they have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſet their fancies more upon outward objects then upon the
<hi>All of all things.</hi>
            </p>

<pb facs="tcp:52339:5"/>
to thy poor fellow-creatures, who are destitute of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

to drink, or cloths to cover their nakedneſs, I ſay, be moved to
all thy fellow-creatures with ſuch pitty and compaſſion, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
their wants, and if thou heareſt any cry in the ſtreets for the
Lords ſake give me a peece of bread, give him, and turn not thy
ſelf away and ſay thou haſt nothing if thou haſt, lest the Lord
turnes away himſelf from you, and you cry, and he will not hear;
as thou didſt hear the poor cry and would not; for know that
pure religion is to viſit the widdow and the fatherleſs, that
if you wil indeed appear to be truely religious and not hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,
be kind hearted &amp; give up to the relief of thoſe that want.</p>
            <p>Moreover Reader, I cannot chuſe but minde thee of a word or
two, and that is this, you may reade that Paul was counted mad,
but he ſaid whither he was mad, or whither he were beſides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
it was for their ſakes, and ſo ſay I, whether I am mad or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
my ſelf, it is for your ſakes: as it is the good pleaſure of my
Father for to make me ſo, that I may give you warning of what
he will do, or God in me ſpeaks to you, for to make you cast away
your Idols and ſeem to the eye to be leſs practitioners of religion,
that ſo you may be more fulfillers of your duties, and leſs hearers
then now you are, that ſo you may be more perfect in doing; and
however you thinke of me, let not the notion of madneſs poſſeſs
your ſpirits, as for you to thinke that I am mad, but rather think
it is the pleaſure of the Father to turn the world upſide-down,
and ſo to make uſe of me as he did of his ſon Jeſus Chriſt: and as
his ſon Jeſus did do things contrary to the cuſtome of the world
in thoſe daies, and all the powers of the world was not able for
to keep him from doing his own worke, even ſo I ſay, the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
God having choſen me for to declare theſe things to you, I
do not question but he will by his infinite power carry this his
own worke on, &amp; none ſhall be able to hinder him from doing his
pleaſure.</p>
            <p>And however you do think of me, as to judge me by your pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſaicall
<pb facs="tcp:52339:6"/>
holyneſs, and are ready to cry out, I have a devil: yet it is
no other with me then it was with Jeſus Chriſt: whom the wiſe
phariſes, or thoſe that did ſeem to be moſt religious for thoſe
formes and customes as were then in uſe according to the law of
Moſes, which they were loth to be beat off: even I ſay thoſe did
cry out againſt Jeſus that he had a devil, and was the chiefe of
the divels, and that he were a blaſphemer; notwithſtanding
he were the only Son, ſent of the Father for to aboliſh and ſo put
to an end thoſe ways of worſhips that were then extant; but they
being poſſeſt with a fancy of their own, that God would not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
that which he had given to his ſervant Moſes, &amp; ſo to them
for to continue for ever, and ſo would not believe that the Chriſt
were the Meſſias, becauſe he came to alter and change the state
and condition of their waies and formes as they walked by, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
it was the pleaſure of the infinite God to forſake
thoſe formes although he had given them for to continue
for ever, which ever came out ſo ſoon as the time was at an end,
for to appear in that way, and then to leave that, and ſo to take to
him another: and in forſaking of theſe formes which he had
given them, his Son whom he had ſent, or his meſſengers met
with many enemies, crying out againſt him and his Apoſtles or
Diſciples; and among theſe his enemies were the learned Phariſes
and Prieſts; and they did ſtir up the people for to forſake Chriſt
and not to cleave to him, for he hath a divel, he ſpeaks blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and will you believe what he ſaies? and ſo they cryed out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Paul, how he turned the world upſide-down, and away with
him (ſaid the learned Phariſee) he is not fitting to live: and if
my Fathers only choiſe ſon met with ſuch hard ſervants for to
deale with him ſo cruelly, and to tel him he had a divel, it is no
wonder in this age of ours why I ſhould (or any of the meſſengers
of the Lord of hoſt that are ſent by him) meet with any other but
the ſame, as to be looked upon as one that turnth the world upſide
down, &amp; ſo not ſitting to live, by declaring new things; as if the
mighty God of Jacob had bound himſelf to be in one form, and
<pb facs="tcp:52339:6"/>
to tarry there for ever, and ſo it is no more to me why you ſhould
call me a blaſphemer, and you even you, O destroying Priests, that
run before you be ſent, and ſo in your pulpits vent your malice
as to cry againſt me, and ſo to bid people beware of me, ſeeing the
Priests in old time, &amp; the outſide Hipocritical Phariſe in thoſedaies
did do it to Jeſus; and I ſay it is no moere to me to be called ſo by
a proud Hipocritical diſſembling outſide pople, that vvould fain
appear to be godyl &amp; ſo for ſuch to ſay I am a blaſphemer, &amp; have
a Divel; and thus ſome doth come as they did to Chriſt, ſome out
of malice, and ſome out of ignorance, being loth to be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of theſe forms and cuſtoms of waies and rules to walk by, for
matter of worſhip, religion being then grown to be more uſed for
cuſtom ſake, then for anything elſe, as it is now aday; wherby it is
high time for the Lord of hoſt to appear, and ſo to take away your
life, as your formes and waies of worſhips now; and ſo for not
making a right uſe of them, to deprive you of them, that you may
no longer diſſemble with your maker which will be but juſt with
God for to do ſo: for notwithſtanding all your formes and
waies of worſhips which you have and walk by, ye are a moſt eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
and malicious people, full of all manner of hypocriſie, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling
with God and with men; but now your hearts ſhall be
made manifest, and ye ſhall now appear in your own colours, and
ſo ſhall be made manifeſt to all what you are; for the day of the
Lord of hoſt is now at hand, to gather his out of myſtical and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral
Babylon, even to gather Sion together and ſo to gather the
wheat from the chaſſe, and though you do, not believe any thing
what I ſay, as being a people bound up in your own waies, and ſo
loth to be deprived of that food, ready to reaſon with the mightie
creator why he wil reveal or make out himſelf to one more then to
another, &amp; will you ſay, ſurely methinks I hear you ſay ſo, that if
God will make out himſelf by viſions &amp; revelations, ſurely he will
do it as well to me as another, and becauſe he doth it not to me, I do
not beleive he will do it to another, and thus Oye proud and ſtout
hearted people, that think all are deluded who have viſions becauſe
<pb facs="tcp:52339:7"/>
you your ſelves have none, and thus you binde and limit the holy
one of Iſrael for to do nothing but what he will firſt make you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with, and ſo make out to you, or elſe you wil not believe;
and not only remain in unbelief, but you cry out againſt them,
they are deluded, and are poſſeſſed with a divel, and ſo wil raile
and ſpeak evil againſt them, and thus you ſhew your malicious
ſpirits, which rather declares your ſelf to be poſſeſt with an evil
ſpirit, or elſe to walk after the fleſh and not after the ſpirit, for
they that are led by the ſpirit of God, walk in peace, love, meeknes,
quietneſs, ſoberneſs tenderneſs, and full of compaſſion and pitty,
and theſe deſire not to be raſh and full of malice, ſpeaking of evil,
railing, curſing, judging, and condemning thoſe that are not of
the ſame mind with them, backbiters, adulterers, Idolaters, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous
perſons, thinking themſelves better then others, and theſe
and ſuch as theſe walk after the fleſh, and are the dogs and ſorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
that ſhall be left without the City, and ſhal not enter into the
gates of the new Jeruſalem; for the ſpirit of God is a ſpirit of light
and love, whereas the ſpirit of the divel is a ſpirit of cruelty, and
murdering of their fellow creatures and is in darkneſs: and the
reaſon why I write my name to be <hi>Jacob Iſrael,</hi> is becauſe my

O you rich men that have abundance of gold and ſilver, and
corn of all ſorts: that hord it up apace, and are loth to feed
the hungry and cloth the naked, do you think you do your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
no ſaith the Lord of hoſt, you do not do your duty, neither do
you ſhew your ſelves ever a whit kind to me, for if you did, you
would not be ſo eager as to lay up abundance and ſee your fellow
creatures ſtarve for hunger. Therefore remember that he that giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to the poor, ſendeth to the Lord, but you have not given to
the poor (for by the poor I mean thoſe that are in want) but ye
have rather oppreſſed the poor, and have cauſed them to cry, and
their cryes are come into mine cares, for I the Lord of hoſt to
take vengeance on you for your cruelty againſt me; <hi>for aſmuch as you
have not done it to one of theſe little ones, you have not done it to me,</hi> which
if you had done it, as to cloth the naked and feed the hungry; and
freely diſperſe to them that are in want, in ſo doing you had done
it to me, and had given me that back which I had given to you:
and then you had done your duty in ſo doing: but becauſe you have
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52339:8"/>
hardned your hearts and have heard the crying of the poor, and
have not regarded them, but have thought your ſelves too good for
them, and have not laid it to heart that they are the works of my
hand, and are made of the ſame mettle and of the ſame blood as
you are, but have thought your ſelves too good for them, becauſe
of the riches which I have lent you; and have made your riches
and your ſtrength your god, and not me (ſaith the Lord,) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I will now come and will not tarry, but will come quickly,
and will take vengeance on you, and will judge you to be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in my wrath, and confounded and ſtand amazed at my ſore diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure;
for I now do awake as a Giant, and as a man of war to
make you houl and weep, and to make you ſee that the ruſt of
your gold and ſilver ſhall now riſe up in judgement againſt you,
and ſhall be a witneſs to torment you; becauſe you have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered
me, as to feed the hungry, and cloath the naked: for I
will now reaſon with you (ſaith the Lord) is that which you have
your own, or are they mine? ſurely you will ſay they are mine;
for I the <hi>All of all things</hi> have made them all, yea all the beaſts of
the field are mine, and therefore you need not be ſo extraodinarily
covetous as to keep theſe creatures which I lend you for your own
private uſe: for if they had bin your own and you could have
made them, then you might have had ſome colour, and have ſaid
<hi>ſhall I make them rich by my labour?</hi> but know this (O man) that
it is I, and I alone that am the life of all creatures, yea even thy
life, and without me you are unable to do any thing, and it hath bin
my pleaſure to beſtow riches on you for this end and purpoſe, that
thou mighteſt give them freely to thoſe that are in want, and not
to make them your Idols as you have done. But becauſe you have
done ſo, as to make your riches your Idols and your gods, and
have not conſidered <hi>that pure religion</hi> (even that religion that is

A viſion wherein I ſaw men feeding their enemies, and clothing

and I heard a voice ſay that theſe men do hold forth my
Image, and do ſhew themſelves to be my ſons and daughters in ſo
doing, but they do nothing but what <hi>I</hi> have commanded them to
do (ſaith the Lord of hoſt) but I will reward them for ſo doing, for
I will keep them in my love and favour, when I will plague and
torment the other that have not done ſo.</p>
            <p>If thy enemy hunger, feed him; if he be naked, cloath him; for
<hi>in ſo doing you ſhall heap coales of fire on his head: hear O all fleſh, for I
have a controverſie with you, and will now plead with you,</hi> eſpecially you
that have abundance of riches: have you fed the hungry? haſt
thou fed them that thou accounts thine enemies? If thou haſt,
thou in ſo doing hath done well; but what meaneth the crying of
the poor ſo much; bread, bread, for the Lord ſake? ſurely this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
that you have not done as you ſhould have done, but have left
that undone which you ſhould have done; thou haſt not fed thine
enemy, neither haſt thou clothed the naked, which thou ſhouldſt
have done: thy own conſcience accuſing thee ſhall now torment
thee; becauſe thou lieſt under the breach of that Scripture, where
it is ſaid <hi>feed thine enemy if he be hungry,</hi> and give him drink, if he be
thirſty: O you rich men, ſhould you feed and cloath your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
as this Scripture ſaies you muſt do ſo; how can you think
that you are the ſervants of the moſt high? whereas inſtead of
feeding your enemies, you deſtroy them; for this is quite contrary
as black is to white, ſurely it is a ſin, I know your conſcience tells
you it is a ſin, becauſe you do not fulfil the Scripture. If this be a ſin,
how far greater ſin is it when you take from them that that ſhould
preſerve them from want, or take away their lives? for you ſee it
is your duty to preſerve life, and not to take away life; it is your
duty to feed them, and not to kill them, ſaith I the Lord of hoſt;
who will plague and torment you for not doing your duty, as to
give that which you have of mine, (that overplus which lies by and
doth no good) unto the poor, <hi>therefore houl and weep, and crie aloud,
for the day of the Lord is at hand that burneth as an even, and the wicked
ſhall be but as aſhes under the ſoals of my Saints ſeet:</hi> you live like <hi>Dives</hi>
in a moſt voluptuous manner, wearing of the beſt, and eating of

poor <hi>Lazarus,</hi> ſo you do not think having your fills of the poor,
yea though they cry in your ear, yet you will not give them

relief, but will rather ſee them ſtarve for want of food: how do
you provoke me to anger ſaith <hi>I</hi> the Lord of hoſt? do you think
that I regard you, and you only becauſe of riches? no I would
have you think that I regard the poor as well as you, even ſo much
that <hi>I</hi> muſt now come down and deſtroy you, and give you your
portion with <hi>Dives,</hi> even to throw you into my wrath and there
to torment you, and ſo to take away your riches and give them to
my Saints, even to theſe poor and hungry ſouls that are now in
great want and miſery: houl, houl and weep, for I come, even I
that will plead for theſe poor creatures that you tread under foot,
and count them as nothing; I come and will redeem them from
you, and from your powers, and will make you know that I
have regard to them, and that they are in my ſight as precious as
you; and that I will be ſuch a terror to them that have aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance

for to have no more then the preſent neceſſity cals for, and ſo to

honour ſhall ceaſe, and then there will be no killing of men for
money, ſtriving after ſelf muſt ceaſe, and then there will be no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie

by humane induſtry, though it may pleaſe God to indue his
Saints and choſen veſſels with tongues at his firſt appearing or
making out himſelf to them, as he did at the firſt appearing in fleſh
make out himſelf to his Apoſtles; but Charity ſhall never ceaſe: for
indeed when all the other fore-mentioned ſhall periſh and come to
nothing, then ſhall this be fulfilled, and not till then; for ſo ſoon as
all things that are now at the preſent paſſes away, and all things
become new; then will charity take place and ſo will abide for

being,</hi> ſaid on this manner as followeth; by the tree is meant all
powers (great or ſmall) whether they be Popes, or Emperors, or
Kings, Princes, Dukes, or Parliaments; he whom you ſaw hew
off the boughes, firſt repreſents I the Lord of hoſt, who will now
cut off thoſe ſuperfluous branches, as thoſe that have made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
rich by earthly powers, and not only them, but I will cut
the tree in the middle, even the very heart of all powers in ſunder,
and ſo will proceed on for to cut down the very root and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all earthly powers, as is ſhown by the digging up the root
of the tree aforeſaid: thus as the tree was digged up by the roots,
even ſo as this tree repreſents all powers, ſo will I root up all pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
even I the Lord of hoſt, the root and foundation of all powers
for the preſent are ſet up by the power and ſtrength of men in all
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52339:11"/>
Nations. It being the good pleaſure of I the Lord of hoſt that it
ſhould be ſo: and ſo by the ſtrength and might of men the mankind
that are made all of one mold and clay deſtroy one another, which
ariſes from a fleſhly domineering and <hi>Eſau's</hi> power, that would
raign over their fellow creatures, which power aſſoon as one is
ſubdued, another takes place, and will do ſo ſtill, but the time
comes, and the ſet time of I the <hi>All of all things</hi> is to be at an end,
and when the fulneſs of theſe dayes ſhall be expired and accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
then one power ſhall not deſtroy another to ſet himſelf in
power to rule over his fellow creatures, no but that power ſhall
deſtroy all powers beſides my ſelfe, as honour and riches ſhall be
deſtroyed, and ſo the root deſtroyed, that <hi>I</hi> the Lord of hoſt may be
<hi>all and in all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the word of the Lord came again ſaying, behold, and lo I
ſaw men and women runnnig together, and every one ſaid, ſave my
god, ſave my god: as if men and women had each of them a god,
which god muſt now be deſtroyed, and I looked to ſee what their
gods were that there was ſuch running up and down to ſave
them, and loe, I ſaw one company, and their gods were gold and
ſilver, but this god was deſtroyed; and another company made
houſes, and another made their lands, but theſe gods I ſaw deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
another made their pride and honour, but theſe gods were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
alſo; and ſo one after another they were all deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
even all thoſe things which men and women have run a
whoring after muſt be deſtroyed and brought to nothing: and I
ſaid, Lord, what meaneth the people to call theſe their gods? and
my excellent majeſtie at whoſe bright appearing all things beſides
himſelf muſt be deſtroyed, who will now ſuddenly appear to make
men weep and houl for the miſeries that are now a coming upon
them, ſaid on this manner as followeth, they call theſe their gods
becauſe they have ſet their hearts more upon theſe things then up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me and have with all eagerneſſe run after theſe things; but I at
my appearing deſtroys them all, and ſo will take from earthly crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
thoſe things wherein they have put moſt truſt and confidence
in, and will deſtroy them in their ſight, even their gods of ſilver and
gold, and will make them throw away their pictures.</p>
            <p>And again the word of the Lord ſaid, behold, and loe I ſaw a
company of men with their hands upon their loynes, weeping
and wayling, crying out for help: and I ſaid, Lord what meaneth
theſe to be ſo feeble and to ſtand as they do crying for help? and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52339:11"/>
my eternal God ſaid, theſe men repreſent all my enemies, and all
my Saints enemies, &amp; as they ſtand with their hands on their loines
crying for help, it ſhowes that I the Lord of hoſt have ſtricken them
with fear and terror, even I have taken their ſtrength from them,
and they ſhall become as weak as water, even ſo weak that one ſhall
ſlay a 100. and a 100. ſlay 10000. for all their ſtrength was taken
from them: ſo that I am confident 1. wil make nothing to ſlay 1000
if it doth pleaſe God to bring his enemies in ſuch a condition:
which propheſie I look to ſee fulfilled in the year of redemtion of
the creation from bondage, which wil be a year of <hi>Jubilee,</hi> and this
<hi>Jubilee</hi> is at hand; for I the Lord of hoſt comes, and wil not tarry,
but will ariſe like a man of war, tearing and devouring in ſunder al
my enemies, and wil conſum them by the breath of my noſtrils, &amp;
they ſhal not be able to ſtand: for I will tread &amp; trample on them
in the fierceneſs of my wrath, &amp; wil make them come bowing down
to the ſoals of the feet of my ſaints, &amp; wil give the ſtrength, &amp; glory,
&amp; honor to my Saints, and they ſhal rejoice and ſing for ever &amp; ever.</p>
            <p>And the word of the Lord came again ſaying, behold what doſt
thou now ſee? and lo I beheld a woman gloriouſly arrayed with a
Scepter in her hand, and ſhe had a maid to wait upon her: and I
ſaid Lord, what meaneth this? and my God the moſt high <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah,</hi>
anſwered me and ſaid, this woman repreſents the ſons and
daughters of <hi>Sion,</hi> and as you ſaw her with a Scepter in her hand,
it denotes unto you that ſhe hath power and ſtrength over all her
enemies, and ſo is a conqueror over them all, and ſo hath them in
ſubjection, be her enemies great or ſmall, more or leſs, ſo then
the time is now a comming that Sion ſhal rejoyce and be glad,
and ſhall ſing for joy of heart when her enemies ſhall ſtand a far off
and weep for bitterneſſe of ſpirit, and as you ſaw her gloriouſly
arrayed, it ſhewes that the ſons and daughters of <hi>Sion</hi> ſhall have
of the beſt, they ſhall eat and drink of the beſt, and wear
of the beſt: not that they ſhall have the others (which are thoſe
whom God in love doth not make out himſelf unto) in bondage &amp;
ſlavery, and ſo deprive them of the outward creatures, no, but they
ſhal have the uſe of the creation, as to have their fil with food and
al neceſſaries belonging to the body: ſo they ſhal in this ſenſe be
their ſervants, as is ſhewed by the maid waiting on the woman.</p>
            <p>And preſently after, I ſaw one in glory with an army following
him, and he cut down his enemies a pace, and left none to oppoſe
him, and of a ſudden I ſaw all his enemies deſtroyed, for this form
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52339:12"/>
of glory is the mighty God that is now riſen to take vengeance on
his enemies and to make them his foot-ſtool, and his armies are
his miniſtring ſpirits, by which he will confound all the glory, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and ſtrength of men, yea even bring to nothing all the glory
and powers of all fleſhly powers how high ſoever they be lifted up,
for alas poor fleſh what art thou now in my hands? I am now riſen
to judge thee, to burn thee up, and ſo to bring thy fleſh to nothing,
yea I will not leave thee root or branch, for there ſhall not be ſon
or nephew, but I, even I the mighty <hi>Jehovah</hi> will make a ſhort
worke, for I will work, and who art thou that ſhall hinder
me from doing my purpoſe? Therefore rejoyce and ſing for joy of
heart, <hi>for behold I come, even I thy king ô Sion, ſhout, ſhout and ſpare not;
lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and ſay my God raignes, even thy holy King
of Sion:</hi> therefore ſing aloud, and let the high praiſes of God be in
thy mouth and a ſharp two-edged ſword in thy hand, and ſo exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
vengeance on them that know not me; bind their Kings and
great men in fetters of Iron, and execute the doom that is written,
even utter deſolation upon all the high and lofty ones, bring
them to utter confuſion, that <hi>they may houl and weep,</hi> becauſe they have
made you even my choſen ones, to be in ſlavery to them, therefore
rejoice <hi>ô</hi> ye daughters of <hi>Sion,</hi> and ſhout <hi>ô</hi> daughters of <hi>Jeruſalem, for
they King cometh,</hi> and he is meek and lowly, <hi>riding upon an As, and upon
a Colt the foal of an Aſs,</hi> ſing and rejoice for joy though ye be never ſo
much deſpiſed, he, even I the King of glory coms <hi>riding upon an Aſs,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
upon ſuch poor deſpiſed &amp; harmleſs creatures, that are willing
to bear any burdens that are laid upon them, even ſuch do I the King
of glory delight to appear in, and not in high and lofty horſes, ſuch
as are puffed up in their high conceits, having a form of godlineſs,
and ſo runs from ſcripture to ſcripture, and by their fleſhly wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
would have it as they pleaſe; no, but even in ſuch do I come,
that with a meek and quiet ſpirit have waited upon me: therefore
ye meek and deſpiſed ones ſing and rejoyce, and go with joy, for
behold I come, even I the Lord of hoſt, and all your enemies ſhall
be your footſtool; for you ſhall now tread Sathan under your feet,
and that by the ſtrength of I your almightineſs dwelling in you.</p>
            <p>And again the word of the Lord ſaid, behold, and loe, I looked
and I ſaw the appearance of ſeven hearts, and they did for a little
while oppoſe one another, but at length they were ſtill and left
off ſtriving one with the other and were all united together as one,
and ſo became one. And I ſaid Lord, what meaneth theſe hearts to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52339:12"/>
be thus joyned together of a ſudden? and my almightineſs, even the
eternall God, by whom all Creatures were made, and by whom
all creatures ſhall be brought to nothing, ſaid on this manner
as followeth, theſe ſeven hearts repreſent my ſons and daughters
that are now under ſeveral diſpenſations oppoſing one another in
their judgements, one ſaying this is the way, another ſaying that is
the way, and ſo by reaſon of their difference oppoſe one another,
and it is out of a ſelf-iſh diſpoſition that rules in them, one would
be fain eſteemed above another by reaſon of his knowledge in the
ſcriptures, which knowledge I am now about to confound, and all
their fleſhly knowledge, let them go under what notion ſoever, and
for that way of baptiſme which is now practiſed and do hold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with none but thoſe that are of their own judgements, but
are bitter and envious againſt thoſe that are not of their way,
judgeing and cenſuring them to be a people that ſlight I the Lord
of hoſt, and ſo are not my beloved, and not thoſe whom I will have
regard unto, but now in the day of my power, I will take away
that ſtone of ſtumbling, I will break them and confound them, and
ſo will make them to ſee that they make much of the ſhell when
the kernel is gone, and will make them to know that thoſe whom
they looked upon as not worthy to be called brethren, are the
choice ſpouſe of I the Lord of hoſt, and ſo will turne unto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
a pure language, that may all ſerve me with one conſent, I wil
even in ſuch a clear way make out my ſelf unto them, that they
ſhal all ſee and know, and all ſpeak by my ſpirit.</p>
            <p>And I ſaw in a viſion all manner of beaſts and kinds of creaturs,
and I was commanded to ſlay and eat: notwithſtanding they were
none of my own, and my excellent majeſtie the King of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
glory ſaid, I will make all men know in a ſhort time that
what they poſſeſs is not their own, but all their treaſurs are mine,
<hi>even I the Lord of hoſt will recover my wooll and my flox, even thoſe treaſurs
which they have made uſe of, and I will take them from them and will make
them know that they ſhall now be for the uſe of my Saints, even for the uſe of
thoſe whom they do moſt deſpiſe;</hi> and if any ſay why do they take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
my goods, as my corn and my wine, and my horſes, and my
cattell? then ſhall even thoſe whom I draw up into my love and
favour ſay, we have need of them, and we in the name of our
creator take them for to make uſe of them, or <hi>the Lord hath need of
them,</hi> and therefore we take them; and what will you ſay to
this O you great men that have abundance? this priviledge is
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52339:13"/>
and will in a more clearer manifeſtation made out whereby the
Saints even poor diſpiſed Sectaries ſhall ſee and know that all
things are theirs, <hi>whether it be Paul</hi> or <hi>Apollo,</hi> or <hi>Cephas, things
preſent, or things to come, all things are yours, and you are
Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods:</hi> here you may ſee that the Saints by
being Chriſts ſons have all things, yea the Apoſtle tels them that
all things are theirs, <hi>houl you therefore, for the ruſt of your Gold and ſilver</hi>
wil now riſe up in judgement againſt you, and it ſhall now tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
you, and vex you; even it will be ſuch a terror to you, and
you ſhall with ſpeed throw it away, even I the Lord of hoſt will
make you throw away your Idols of gold &amp; of ſilver, and hide your
ſelves for fear of me, for whatſoever is in the ſhambles take and
eat, for the earth is the Lords, and the fulneſs thereof; all the earth
is mine, even mine it is, and all the cattel of the field, therefore
ſlay and eat, and have all things common, as my ſaints at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
of me in fleſh had, and therefore be contented, O you rich
men, to give up, leſt I ſmite you with a curſe; for behold I come and
will make my ſaints breake bread from houſe to houſe, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
they did; and will make them for to have comunion, and
all things common; ſo that they ſhall not ſay this is mine, or
that is mine; but I will deſtroy this, and ſo I will deſtroy all ſelf
in them, and they ſhall now live in the pure enjoyment of I the
Lord of hoſt, <hi>breaking bread with ſingleneſs of heart from houſe to houſe:</hi>
ſo that my ſons and daughters ſhall live in more union then they
do now, for now they are readie to cut and deſtroy one another
for a little ſilver, which ſhal now periſh and be accounted as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:
even <hi>I</hi> wil make all ſorts of men freely give away that they
have, and be contented to have nothing but what they ſhall have
need of from day to day; for I wil make love and union to encreaſe,
that the whole earth ſhall be a treaſure for all, and not for ſome;
ſo that according as they are in want, they ſhal have one ſhal have
a ſpecial care over another; for the emnity being taken away, and the
curſe removed from off the earth, ſelf-love ſhal ceaſe, and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
love ſhall flow in, and then righteouſneſs ſhal look down from
heaven, and ſpring out of the earth; and there will be no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
in our ſtreets, as there is now, crying out for <hi>bread, bread,
for the Lords ſake;</hi> no, but this noiſe ſhall ceaſe, and the ſaying of
<hi>James</hi> come more into their minds: that they ſhall now not
think it enough to ſay, <hi>be ye warmed,</hi> and ſo give the poor nothing,
but only pitty them and feed them with words, but they ſhal now
ſay, <hi>come in, eat and drink with us, for you are the work of the Lord, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52339:13"/>
what we have now you may freely take,</hi> for the Lord of hoſt hath now
made bare his holy armes, and all the earth ſhall ſee the ſalvation
of God, and all ſhall now know and ſee that the Lord hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
the creation from bondage into the liberty of the ſons of
God; all men ſhall be freed from the Bondage and ſlavery they
now are under, and ſhall now begin to ſee and know that it is a
ſin to have reſpect to one in glorious apparel, and ſay, <hi>pray Sir come
you and ſit up here,</hi> when you ſay to one in poor cloathes, <hi>ſit thou at
our foot ſtool,</hi> for I the Lord of hoſt will make you all know now
that you are all of one blood, and ſo are all now fellow creatures,
and that I have as much reſpect to one in poor cloths, as to one
in gay ones; and that I will make you know that its your duty for
to love one another, even your enemies; for if you fulfil the roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
law according to Scripture, <hi>thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf;</hi>
which is not for the preſent, who art thou that hath fulfilled this
Scripture that can ſay and thy conſcience not accuſe thee to thy face,
that thou doth love thy neighbor as thy ſelf? but rather thy conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
will tel thee, that thou doſt not love thy neighbor as thy ſelf;
for if thou didſt, thou wouldſt not let thy neighbour be in want,
but would have as much care of him as thy ſelf; if thou haſt roſt-meat,
to let him have roſt-meat; and in ſo doing thou will ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil
this Scripture: therefore yea that do plead for Scripture ſo
much, and make ſo gallant a ſhow of religion as you do, conſider
the Scriptures aforementioned, and you ſhall ſee that you live far
ſhort of fulfilling the Scripture: <hi>for what ſoever you would that men
ſhould do unto you, even ſo do thou unto them, for this is the Law and the
Prophets:</hi> wouldſt thou have men to love you and do you good? if
thou wouldſt then thou muſt love them and do them good: but
indeed you will ſay, why ſhould I love them, they are of a ſtrange
opinion: this is but the Devil in you for hating your fellow crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
which muſt be deſtroyed and brought to nothing, that I the
Lord of hoſt may be exalted; which will not be till I make my
ſtrange work come to paſs, as to deſtroy all ſelf and private intreſt,
of ſaying <hi>this is mine;</hi> and when this is done, then you will love
your neighbour as your ſelf, and then you ſhall ſee and know
with the Apoſtle, that <hi>all things are lawful for you,</hi> that is as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
knew that he might do what he would do, and have what
creatures he would have for food and rayment, in that they are
all gods: ſo you ſhall now know that you may have the uſe of all,
and ſee all to be yours, and that this is the work of God for to
bring in univerſall love and freedome.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:52339:14"/>
And the Lord ſaid behold, behold: what doſt thou ſee? loe
I beheld, and there appeared a tree full of fruit; and the fruit, much
like to <hi>apples</hi> one part of them, and the other part of them like unto
<hi>peares,</hi> and I ſaid, Lord, what meaneth this tree? and the Lord
ſaid, this tree doth repreſent Chriſt: that as thou ſeeſt fruit upon
this tree, and it is very pleaſant to ſee to: even ſo is Jeſus Chriſt
a tree of life that bears abundance of fruit, and as thou ſaweſt theſe
men and women gather this fruit and eat them, and preſently
there was new fruit in the room of that which was pulled off.</p>
            <p>Theſe men and women re-preſent my ſons and daughters, who
are alwayes a feeding on Jeſus Chriſt, and yet cannot make him
to leave off bearing fruit: and as thou ſaweſt that theſe men and
women that pulled and ate <hi>did live for ever,</hi> and were not to dy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it, doth ſhew that my ſons and daughters feeding on me the
Lord of hoſt, <hi>ſhall live for ever:</hi> for as thou ſaweſt that this food was
very pleaſant; even ſo am I the Lord of hoſt to thoſe that do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in me.</p>
            <p>And moreover this tree doth ſet forth the tree that is ſpoken
of in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> to be a tree of life <hi>that ſhall heal the nations,</hi> for
as thou did ſee this tree appear of a ſudden with fruit thereon: even
ſo will I the Lord of life, that lives for evermore, appear in ſuch
an hour, and at ſuch a time, when moſt men little think of me,
to the deſtruction of them, and bringing of them to nothing,
that ſo I may appear to be the life of thoſe that do now know me
and enjoy me: for by my appearing will I make my ſelf manifeſt
to be the food that every one muſt eat of: and that all other food,
which is not of me, muſt be brought to nothing: for as I am ſet
forth by a tree, ſo will I appear in power to the confounding of
thoſe that feed not on me: and ſo will make waſt all their gods
which they have to feed upon beſides me, and all and every one
ſhall be brought to nothing, that I the Lord of hoſt may be all
and in all, and ſo exalted above all, to which I ſay amen.</p>
            <p>And preſently after this there appeared a garden full of flowers,
as to my thinking, I ſaw them like roſes of all ſorts, and corna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
pinks, and all manner of flowers, and I ſaid, Lord, what doth
theſe mean? and the Lord ſaid, theſe do repreſent abundance of
joy, even the verities of joys which my ſons and daughters ſhall
have, even they ſhall enjoy the moſt precious and moſt pleaſant
jewells that are or can be; for they ſhall have the uſe of all things
that are precious, and ſhall have the enjoyment of all the treaſurs
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52339:14"/>
of the world, and nothing ſhall be unpleaſant to them, but every
thing ſhall give a good ſmell, and ſhall be very pleaſant to them
making of them to rejoyce, and ſing and ſet forth the praiſe of me
the Lord of hoſt: for as theſe flowers did ſmel moſt ſweetly; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
ſo, ſaith the Lord of hoſt, will I by my own power, make all
things that appear now to be unſavory or unpleaſant, to give a
moſt pleaſant ſmell, and as thou didſt ſee in this garden abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of green herbes: theſe green herbes, doth ſet forth the flour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing
conditions of my Saints, even of my ſons and daughters;
how that they ſhall grow and flouriſh in diſpight of all their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
for their bones ſhall flouriſh as an herb, and as herbs be good
for all ſorts of men and women, even ſo ſhall my ſons and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
be good for all; and by their flouriſhing and growing up as
calves in the ſtall, it ſhews that people that are now kept in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
even the meaner ſort, ſhall be by the flouriſhing condition
of my ſons and daughters, reſtored from that ſlavery and bondage
as they are now kept under by rich men, ſo as they cannot injoy
the creatures of God ſo as to have their bellys full even into ſuch
a condition ſhall they be reſtored as that they ſhall now enjoy the
good creatures of God, and ſhall have enough of the outward
mercies, as for the back and belly <hi>ſo that there ſhall be no complaining in
the ſtreet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And preſently after this, there appeared one that was very glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
and he had a cup in his hand, and it was full, and he gave
it to men and to women for them to drink, and <hi>I</hi> ſaid, Lord,
who doth this man repreſent? and what doth his cup ſignifie?
and what is in this cup? and my excellent God the King of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
glory ſaid, by this man, is ſhewed I the Lord of hoſt, and the cup
doth repreſent, that I the Lord of hoſt have ſomething for to make
men and women drink of: theſe men and women repreſent my ſons
and daughters; and that which was in the cup, which the men and
women drank of was wine; which holds forth thus much: that it is
the pleaſure of me the Lord of hoſt, to give unto my ſons and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
for to drink-wine: for as much as wine is ſet forth to be a
nouriſher and cheriſher of the nature of man, and as thou ſaweſt
them that did drink of the wine which I gave them were merry,
and did fall to ſinging and to dancing: even ſo by my pouring
forth of my ſpirit, or my ſelf into my ſons and daughters, ſo as
to make my ſelf manifeſt in a more clear diſcovery of my ſelf to
them, as to make them ſee and know that I the God of love, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52339:15"/>
peace, and glory, dwels in them, acts in them, and ſo doth all
things in them, and that I have taken them up for to be my dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
place, and habitation, and that nothing can hurt them or do
them any harm without me: will ocaſion them in like manner
for to break forth and ſing, and dance, <hi>and leap for joy of heart,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
filled with new wine of the ſpirit: for put new wine into old
bottels and they will burſt if they have not vent, or elſe the old
bottles will ſpoyl the new wine: ſo I by filling my ſons and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
with my ſelf, doth cauſe a ſpoyl firſt to be made in the old
bottles, their body, and then afterwards doth cauſe them to bring
forth my ſelf, and ſo do my will: though it be the pleaſure of me
their king to act them in ſuch a way as will prove the ruin of their
good name, yet they muſt do it; for the wine of the ſpirit muſt
have a vent, or elſe the body will break.</p>
            <p>And the word of the Lord came unto me ſaying, behold, and lo
I looked, and there appeared a man, and he had in his hand a ſharp
knife, and he ripped up the bellys of men and women, even of all
ſorts, under what religion ſoever they were termed to be: And I
ſaid, Lord, what is the meaning of this man that doth ſo as he
doth. And the Lord ſaid, this man repreſents me the Lord of hoſt,
and as thou did ſee him open them, it ſhowes that I the Lord of
hoſt have a peircing eye to diſcern what is in them, and what
they are, notwithſtanding their outward profeſſions, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ſhows of holineſs, yet I the God of gods ſee all their inward
parts, and know their ſecret thoughts, and the private intents
of their hearts, and how full of hypocriſie they are, diſſembling
with me and men, and how they make religion a cloak for to
hide their knavery, even becauſe they may the better couſen and
cheat their fellow creatures, and keep them in bondage and ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
and alſo from the enjoyments of the outward creation, which
I have made for man, that they may have the uſe of them, of the
outward creatures, and ſo live comforatbly by enjoying the fruits of
the earth; <hi>for the earth is the Lords and the fulneſs thereof,</hi> and al things
are mine even mine; therefore the crying of the poor, and the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie
of all ſorts of men, makes me make haſt to declare that I the
Lord of hoſt am now coming to <hi>judge the world with righteouſneſs,
and ſo to give them every one according to their deſerts: but ſhall the ſon of man
find faith on earth when be comes?</hi> no, he ſhall not, for though I do
declare my ſelf by my ſervants the prophets, whom I ſtir up for to
make out my ſelf unto them; yet I find and do ſee; that amongſt

all ſorts of men there is but little faith, for to believe that I the
Lord of hoſt am now ready to appear in power, and in glory, and in
Majeſty, for to confound and bring to nothing al powers beſide my
ſelf, and ſo to make bare my holy arm in al nations, and ſo to lay
open all mens hearts, and make them ſee their folly for diſſembling
with me: for as thou ſawſt them opened, and when they were open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to thy view, though before they ſeemed to be very white, yet even
the moſt pureſt, eſpecially thoſe under the name of Presbyterians
and Independents, who ſeemed very white, that is, they had very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilded
outſides, as forms and ways of worſhips, as obſerving of the
Sabbath, and being zealous for they way of worſhip, even ſo zealous,
as to judge, cenſure, and condemn thoſe that were not of their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
yet notwithſtanding al this, their hearts are ful of hpyocriſie;
ſhewed by the blackneſs that was within them, and ſo inſtead of
ſerving me, and bringing glory to my name, they make uſe of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
to ſerve their own ends, being as covetous, and as proud, and as
ful of ambition and cruelty as thoſe that make no profeſſion at al;
and likwiſe the church called <hi>the Anabaptiſts</hi> are linked much in
your name, more for to make a ſhew of religion, then to ſerve God,
even I the God of gods, out of love, as is ſhowed by your harſh
judgement and cenſureing thoſe that do out-ſtrip, or thoſe whom
I the Lord of hoſt am pleaſed to take up higher then you; as ſuch
as are deluded and deceived by fancies, and by the divel, as it doth
appear by your cruel words and ſpeeches againſt them: therefore
ſaith I the Lord of hoſt, who ſees your outward profeſſions, and
knowes the ſecret thoughts and intents of your hearts, how that
you do ſtrive for to exalt your ſelves, and ſo to make your ſelves
great, and are ready for to diſſembly with me, the Lord of hoſt, as
though you knew not any god at all; for diſſembling, and lying,
and cheating that raignes amongſt you, and amongſt all ſorts of
people, ye have hardned you hearts as if the Lord had ſpoken to
you, and had told you that you ſhal never fal, and ſo you prompt
your ſelves up in your ways, which I the Lord of hoſt muſt deſtroy,
even your church ways, that ſo I may torment you, and purifie
that blackneſs that remaines under your gilded profeſſions, and ſo
draw you up unto me, even to a more neerneſs and oneneſs with
me, that ſo lying and diſſembling may be taken away from you,
and ſo make you deal plainly with God, and with your fellow
creatures; and for the reſt even thoſe of the world, that have no
knowledge of me, I muſt torment them, by deſtroying their gods,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52339:16"/>
and bringing of them to nothing: yet I muſt tel you, that they
are in one manner not ſo much to be blamed as you; becauſe they
know nothing; therefore I look that they ſhould perform no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:
but you that know ſomething, and profeſs me, and act
and walk contrary to me, you are but diſſemblers and hypocrites
at the beſt; for you know that you muſt love all men, and yet you
hate all that differ from you in judgement, and ſo deſerve to be
a little more tormented for diſſembling with your ſelves; I promiſe
you you ſhal be tormented; and though the world and you be giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
to diſſembling and lying, and to eat and drink, and marry,
and give one another in marriage, as the people of old did, it is but
what our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt did propheſie ſhould be the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of you in the laſt age; but as I the Lord of hoſt did fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warn
my creatures, even man, and all creatures from deſtruction
by my ſervant <hi>Noah,</hi> and made him a preacher of righteouſneſs, for
to tel them that deſtruction was coming upon them, and that
they for their wickedneſs muſt be deſtroyed: even ſo have <hi>I</hi> now,
even I the Lord of hoſt, raiſed up a man, or two, or three, yea twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to teſtifie that I the Lord of hoſt wil ſhortly appeare, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
and deſtroy all things by myſelf, as <hi>I</hi> did in the days of
<hi>Noah:</hi> for the wickedneſs of this generation doth ſurpaſs the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs
of thoſe that were in thoſe days, but as my ſervant <hi>Noah</hi>
was <hi>mocked at, and laughed at,</hi> and alſo derided for telling of them
that <hi>deſtruction was at hand,</hi> even ſo it is my pleaſure now to ſend you a
declaration, by one whom I have ſtirred up, and commanded him to
put it in print, that you may ſee that I the Lord of hoſt wil come &amp;
confound you, and bring you to nothing, and deſtroy your gods,
even your idols of <hi>gold and ſilver,</hi> &amp; wil make you throw them away:
but hang it ſay you, this is a deluſion, the divel is in him, &amp; ſo hath fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
him ful of fancies, and hath diſtracted his braines, &amp; hath made
him mad, and ſo wil rail againſt him, and revile and ſpeak all
manner of evil againſt him: this I know you wil do, as they of
old did unto my ſervant <hi>Noah:</hi> but remember that that day as <hi>Noah</hi>
went into the ark which he builded, and all his family with him,
and alſo all ſorts of creatures, even then I the Lord of hoſt did
begin to poure out upon them the fierceneſs of my wrath, as I had
told them by <hi>Noah,</hi> ſo you that mock, and laugh, and revile againſt
my meſſengers now, &amp; ſay the day of the Lord is not at hand as yet,
for him to do ſuch things, (and therefore wil not conſider <hi>for to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the poor, and let the oppreſſed go free, and ſo to breake the bands of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52339:16"/>
but wil ſtil perſiſt in the evil of your wayes:</hi> as if you had no warning
at all; even for your own ſelves, when you think ſafty, and cry
peace even then <hi>ſudden deſtruction comes upon you, even when you little
think of it,</hi> as it did upon the world of old, and then wil <hi>I</hi> tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and plague you for deſpiſing my meſſengers and ſervants,
and wil be a terror and a dread to you, and you ſhal houl and
weep, and my ſervants <hi>ſhall ſing and rejoyce for joy and gladneſs of heart;</hi>
for as <hi>Noah</hi> and all them that went in with him became one, and
of one family, and all the creatures became one, as being in union
and love one with another, even ſo wil I now make all creatures,
eſpecially my ſons and daughters, for to eat and drink together,
and ſo to be of one family, and of one houſhold, having all things
common; and wil alſo make you that now revile them, be ſtil
and ſilent, and in pain for doing ſo, and I wil make alſo all the
creatures to be at love and peace one with the other, as they that
were in <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke together, ſo that there ſhal be peace and
union.</p>
            <p>And the Lord ſaid, behold what I wil ſhew thee; and loe I
looked, and there appeared a man, and he went up and down, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
men together: and I ſaid, Lord, what meaneth this man
togather men together? and what men are theſe? and my eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
God ſaid, this man repreſents I the Lord of hoſt, gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my people together: and I ſaid, Lord, what people? and my
God ſaid, the Jewes, that I may bring them in to believe on my
name, and ſo to make them come with <hi>weeping and ſupplications,</hi> and
and make them know that they have peirced me, and ſo have
not bin in my way as to ſee and know that Jeſus Chriſt their King
and Saviour is already come, but their eies have bin blinded and
hardened, ſo that they could not ſee as yet: but though they have
fell, yet I the Lord of hoſt, wil graft them into the vine again,
and they ſhal ſee and know that I have according to my promiſe
ſent them a Saviour and a King already, whom they have cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
and I wil now make them ſee and know that they have cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
the King of the Iewes in their own Land, for which cauſe
I have diſperſed them, and made them to be a people ſcattered in
all nations; and all people have had them at command, ſo that
they have bin the <hi>reproach of the heathen,</hi> and all the heathen or aliens
from me the Lord of hoſt, hath perſecuted them, and have ſhed
their blood, But I will now even in the fulneſs of time open
their eies, that they ſhall ſee and know, that they have crucified
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52339:17"/>
Chriſt their King, whom all their prophets made mention of, and
all their leviticall obſervations did typifie out: which King they
ſhall now ſee was not to come at that time to deliver them
from bondage of other nations, but ſhall now even at this time
which is to come, ſee and know that all faces ſhall be made black
with paleneſs, and a noiſe from a mongſt them ſhall come forth,
that the Lord hath founded <hi>Sion,</hi> and the poor of the people ſhall
truſt in it; even <hi>I</hi> will make my people now come with ſinging,
and with rejoycing, becauſe I have opened their eies, and have taken
out their ſtony hearts, and <hi>have given them hearts of fleſh,</hi> even ſuch
hearts, as they ſhall no longer denie that Jeſus their Saviour is
come, but ſhall confeſs that he is come, and that they have cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
him; and ſo ſhall ſee that I have cauſed them to be in ſuch a
condition as they are now in: for it was my good pleaſure that it
ſhould be ſo; but now will I riſe, and will ſhow my power for to
redeem them from this <hi>Egyptian bondage</hi> they are now in; even
as <hi>I</hi> did appear <hi>for their fathers of old, and did bring them from the land
of Egypt by my mightie and ſtrong hand,</hi> by my ſervant <hi>Moſes,</hi> whom
I did ſtir up for that purpoſe: even ſo will I make my power ſeen in
all nations, by ſtiring my ſervants up, and alſo by ſending
them a leader for to lead them, as my ſons of old had, and as all
Kings and great men fell that oppoſed them, even ſo will I make all
for to fall and periſh, and become as weak as water, that ſo I may
bring you into your own land again; and all thoſe that hinder you
or riſe in armes againſt you, ſhall be <hi>drowned</hi> in my wrath and ſore
diſpleaſure, even as <hi>Pharoah of old was drowned in the red ſea,</hi> ſo I will
ſet me glory and honour, and will make you appear to be Kings
and Conquerours, through me that love you; and ſo wil bring
you into your one land with <hi>joy and gladneſs,</hi> and there will make
you for to ly down in peace, and to be at reſt, when I will torment
and trouble all nations that have fought againſt you, and they ſhall
<hi>weep, and houl, and cry out for ſorrow of heart;</hi> but I will make you my
Choſen ones, and alſo them whom I wil bring up with you, and have
called them by my name, to come and go up to the height of <hi>Sion,
with everlaſting ſongs,</hi> ſinging and rejoycing with abundance of joy,
in that I have created <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> a joy, and her people a rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing:
<hi>for I will make a new Heaven, and a new earth, wherein righteouſneſs
ſhall dwell,</hi> for I wil make deſolation, and wil deſtroy all things
that are now at the preſent, and <hi>ſo will make all things new;</hi> new
in reſpect that I have gathered you out of all countries, and have

once again brought you into your own land, <hi>for to make you the joy, and
the praiſe of the whole earth;</hi> and the place and land where I wil

bowing and bending and ſubmit unto that hath and wil ſtil bring
you in the everlaſting joy, where all is joy, and all ſhal be joy and
peace; ſo that they ſhal bring (even your enemies) their treaſurs
and riches, <hi>and the fullneſs of the gentils ſhall be brought in: rejoyce and

and have brought you into your own land, there for to make you the praiſe
of the whole earth;</hi> and all the <hi>glory of nations ſhall be brought into it,</hi> even
into that City, <hi>where nothing but righteouſneſs ſhall dwell,</hi> and all dogs,

of life ſhal not enter into this City, even into this new <hi>Jeruſalem,
which ſhall be made the praiſe of the whole earth;</hi> for this <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth
of all the ſons and daughters of <hi>Sion,</hi> who ſhall be brought
out of all countries, and out of all nations, into this land which I
have choſen, for to make my ſelf a glorious name, and ſo to make
my name a terror and a dread to all that come not into this City;
for without are none but forcerers, and ſuch as makes a ly, as dogs
and ſuch filthy creatures; for dogs are a moſt beaſtly creature, and
ſeem to be a creature good for little, even here ſuch as are to
be left out are compared to dogs; for all dogs are cruel and envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and are ready to deſtroy themſelves by fighting one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
and alſo their condition is, they alwayes are grumbling
and ſnapping one at another, as ſtriving for maſtery; ſo are theſe
people that are to be left out of this City, a people who have giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
themſelves over to rule and domineere over their fellow-creatures,
and would have all in ſubjection to them, and they
would be lords, and ſo would have their fellow-creatures in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
to them, and keep them as ſervants and bond-men, even for to
work and labour for them, when they themſelves have all the
joy and pleaſure; but now, even upon ſuch dogs, that have riſen

that I may make them know that my time is now at hand, for
to give redemption to my creatures, eſpecially to my ſons and

and ſlavery, and ſo to make them a joy and rejoicing, <hi>ſinging for joy

but to be left without, even without my joy and love, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of your ſorceries, becauſe of your eſtrangneſs from me;
counting all your pleaſurs and happines to be in things here below
even in outward ſubſtance, treaſuring up gold and ſilver, which hath
bewitched you from the truth, and would not let you hear that
the beſt and cheifeſt commandement is, <hi>for to ſell and give to the poor,</hi>
but when this hath buzzed in your eares, and your own conſcience
accuſing you for it, you have like the young man in the Goſpel, as
you call it, which fain would go to heaven, and ſo have reſt, but
loth to fulfil our Saviours command; <hi>ſell that which thou haſt and give
to the poor, and ſo thou ſhalt have treaſure in heaven,</hi> as if my ſon Chriſt
had ſaid, do not you think that by obſerving a little outward way
of worſhip, and ſo walking on in formes, and making an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
profeſſion of religion, having <hi>a forme of godlineſs,</hi> that you
ſhal enter into my reſt, not knowing that you are bewitch from
me, in that you make ſo much of an outward eſtate, as of houſes,
and lands, and alſo of gold, and ſilver, wherein you put more
truſt and confidence then in me; therefore it is but juſt for me the
Lord of hoſt to deal, or to give you ſuch a hard leſſon for you to
learn, <hi>ſell all thou haſt and give to the poor,</hi> for they have need of it,
even of my mony, &amp;, houſes and lands; which if you do not, you are
like to incur my ſore diſpleaſure, and ſo to be deprived of my
reſt, for not ſubmitting to this my command; which is one of the
greateſt commandements, <hi>as that thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf:</hi>
but O thou proud <hi>Eſau,</hi> and haughty <hi>Lucifer, that exalts thy ſelf above
thy fellow-Creatures,</hi> what ſaies thou to this? do I command thee for
to ſel that which thou haſt and give to the poor? and thou inſtead
of doing ſo, doſt quite contrary, even the oppreſs them, and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
and cheat them, and bring them before the judgement-ſeat
haling them to priſons, do you think for this that I will be as,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52339:18"/>
wel pleaſed with you as if you had done what I commanded you
to do; <hi>ſell that which thou haſt and thou ſhalt have treaſure in heaven?</hi>
which if thou doſt not, I will ſhut thee out of my love and favour,
and ſo thou ſhall not enter into the citty wherein my glory ſhall
be manifeſted, and made for to out-ſhine all the glory of the world,
becauſe thou art diſobedient to me, and wilt not love thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
as thy ſelf, according as I have commanded thee to do, but
doſt ſtill perſiſt in hording up of corn, and mony, and all the beſt
of the things of the world for thy own private uſe, and ſo will
not give to the poor, but doth count thy honour for to have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of the riches of this world, and wil live very gallantly, &amp; go in
the beſt, and eat of the beſt, when thy fellow-creatures have none
of the worſt, whom I love as well as you; but O! thou proud <hi>Eſau
that exalts thy ſelf above thy fellow-creatures,</hi> I wil reaſon with you,
how or wherein doſt thou fulfil my wil? I commanded thee, for
<hi>to ſell that thou haſt,</hi> and give away, but that thou haſt not, done:
thou wilt have houſes and lands of thy own, and gold and ſilver
in bags and cheſts, when others have none; and wil not if you
hear one of your fellow-creatures cry <hi>for the Lord ſake give me ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi>
you wil turn your eares from the crying of the poor, and
wil tel a ly too, and ſay, <hi>you have nothing,</hi> when you have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
though they asked in my name, yet you wil not give;
though I command thee for to <hi>give all that thou haſt;</hi> but thou
wilt make a ly to ſave that which I have commanded thee, even all
you that have abundance: to give unto thy fellow-creatures: for
lyers are and ſhal be without: and again <hi>how doſt thou love thy neighbour
as thy ſelf,</hi> when thou eateſt of the beſt, and drinks of the beſt, and
wears of the beſt, and lives at eaſe, freeing your ſelves from hard
labour, which thy poor neighbours are made for your cruelty o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
them to undergo? therefore conſider this, left I take you away
from your own pleaſures, as you cal it, from eating of the beſt,
and drinking and wearing of the beſt, and inſtead of it, give you
ragges to put on, and the worſt for you to eat and drink, even
curſe your dainty things, and make all things become gall and
worm-wood; becauſe you break this commandement of mine:
<hi>love thy neighbour as well as thy ſelf:</hi> which if you did fulfil, which is
my pleaſure you ſhould; then would you give to your poor neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
ſuch things as your ſelves have: if you your ſelves have
roſt-meat, then would you give them roſt-meat, or ſee that they
have roſt-meat; if you your ſelves have good drink, then would
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52339:19"/>
you ſee that they ſhould not drink water, but have good drink:
if you your ſelves have good cloaths, then would you ſee
that they ſhould have good cloaths, and ſo would not let them go
naked; but would be like my ſervant <hi>Job, give bread to the hungry, and
clothes to the naked;</hi> if you your ſelves have eaſe and reſt from labour,
then you would not ſee them labour like horſes, and take no pitty
of them; neither would you then give your ſelves over to be ſo
cruell and hard hearted, as to make ſlaves of your fellow creatures,
whom I command you to love as wel as your ſelves: but here you
may ſee how you ſlight me, and how little you regard me; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of doing what you ſhould do, you do that you ſhould not:
I command you <hi>for to love your neighbour,</hi> and inſtead of my command,
you hate your neighbour: but do you think this may ſerve my turn,
or that I wil be pleaſed for you to do ſo as you do? no, I wil not be
pleaſed with you, unleſs you fulfil my commandements, <hi>as in love
thy neighbour as well as thy ſelf:</hi> which if you did, you would <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="5+ letters">

               </gap>te
them: but you may ſay, they are my enemies, and ſhal I love them
as wel as my ſelf? though they are your enemies, it is my plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
that you ſhould love them as wel as your ſelf: <hi>love your enemies,</hi>
ſaith my ſon Chriſt, <hi>bleſs them, and pray for them; that you may ſhew your
ſelves to be like my father which is in heaven:</hi> but if you do not
love your enemies, neither your neighbour, it ſhewes that you do
not fulfil my command; neither are you like me, who loves all,
<hi>and cauſes my rain to rain on the unjuſt as well as on the juſt:</hi> but you
cannot abide to hear of theſe things; to let your neighbours be
as your ſelves; by reaſon of that <hi>proud fleſh,</hi> that rules and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers
in you, as to make you think better of your ſelves then you
are; <hi>Eſau</hi>-like ruling and domineering over <hi>Iacob,</hi> but I will cut
you ſhort, and wil make you, notwithſtanding you go to
Church, and here Sermons and have your children baptized,
as you call it, and obſerve Sunday; that you have diſobeyed my
voice, and have not walked humbly with mee; and ſo you are no
other but ſorcerers, ſuch as muſt not come into my place where I
will make my name known more then in any place, which ſhall
be <hi>Jeruſalem the citty of the living King;</hi> whether I will gather my
ſons and daughters out of all countries, to go thither and you
that have <hi>loved to make a ly ſhall be ſhut cut even with dogs and ſorcerers,</hi>
and ſo having no right to the tree of life muſt not enter into the

even into my reſt and joys, for the Jeruſalem which I have built,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52339:19"/>
and wil gather my ſons and daughters thither for to be tire

and make them to be ful of joy and glory, even the glory of all

to be as nothing in compariſon of them, this I ſay ſhal torment
you, even you O proud and ſtout ones, that are loth to be pulled
out of your throns of glory, as to be deprived of that ſelf &amp; fleſhly
ruling power which in you, but though thou art to be deprived of it,
yet thou ſhalt even of a ſudden, yea in an hour when thou art ready
to cry peace, peace, and ſo to flatter thy ſelf in thy own fleſhly pampe,
to ſtrive after riches and honour, and ſo to get thy ſelf a great
name: as when you have a bundance of oxen and cowes, and two
or three Farmes and perhaps buſhels of money keeping poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
under you, even thy fellow creatures; thus crying peace,
and ſee no likelyneſs of a change, thou wilt not be mindeful of

remembring Paules expreſſions, <hi>when you cry peace, peace, behold
ſudden deſtruction is upon you:</hi> even a conſumption to all your out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

<hi>all of all things,</hi> even mine the eternal God, and ſo ſay to your fellow
creatures whom now we have made ſlaves of, we have nothing of
our own, for if this be not ſufficient warrant or meſſage for to
make you relieve the <hi>widdow and the fatherleſs,</hi> and ſo diſperſe abroad,
telling of them it is yours and not mine; I wil come with a far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
torment, and will appear in ſuch fury, that I will make you
think that you ſee the devil ſtanding by you at all times torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you, and plaguing you, becauſe you do not give up: therefore
give up before I deſtroy you in my wrath and fury, for I am
now riſen to cal all my ſtewards to an account, even you mighty
ones unto whom I have lent much; but finding of you to be very
cruel to your fellow-creatures, and that you have not dealt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
with them, I come to judge you, and to cal you to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count;
for your wickedneſs is ſo often in my eares, that I can ſtay
no longer: therefore I paſs this ſentence againſt you, O rich men;
that I wil utterly deſtroy you, and bring you to nothing, yea I wil
torment you day and night, that ſo I may make you know that
the laſt dayes are now at hand, which my ſervant <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake of,
even the day is now at hand, <hi>that they that are married, ſhall be as if
they were not, and they that uſe the world as if they uſed it not:</hi> why ſo, as
if you ſhould ſay; the ſame Apoſtle gives a reaſon; for ſayes he,
<hi>the faſhion of this world paſſeth away:</hi> O you rich men, leave off hord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of gold and ſilver, leaſt the ruſt and canker riſes in your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
and ſo makes you hang or drown your ſelves, and ſo you
run your ſelves into a pit of miſery, even into hell, for the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
ſhal be as if they were unmarried; that is, I by my bright
appearing wil ſo powerfully manifeſt my ſelf, that i wil be a ſharpe
two edged ſword, cutting and devouring in ſunder all the waies
that have bin acted contrary to me that is now on foot: for I wil
gather my own together from the power of their enemies, that
if any of mine, whether man or woman, be joined together to one,
that is, of my ſtock, nor wil have no heed to my voice, if it be a man, he
may freely leave his wife; if a woman ſhe may freely leave her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52339:20"/>
and in my ſight do it lawfully, becauſe the time is now at hand
that thoſe that are married are as if they were unmarried &amp; I for this
end and purpoſe, even I the Lord of hoſt wil have it to be ſo: that
I may <hi>ſeperate the just and unjuſt,</hi> that I may gather my ſons and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
out from amongſt their hateful enemies, and bring them into
their own countrie; which ſhal be the Jeruſalem that now lies
waſt: but it ſhal be inhabited once again, and made to be the praiſe
of the whole earth: therefore flee every one of you out of <hi>Babylon,</hi>
for her judgements are great and reaches to the skies; and go you
up into your own countrie, and there declare the praiſes of God:
firſt I would have my people go out of Babylon, which if they do,
they muſt not tarry here, or in any place wherein I do not appear
for to ſpeak to them: but come you my ſons and daughters out of
Babylon, your captivity, and bondage, and come with me out
of this confuſion, and out of theſe falſe waies and governments,
and formes of worſhips: for I muſt pour out my judgement upon
them all, and I wil plague all them that wil hinder you from doing
my wil, as to keep you that you ſhal not come from them, even
every thing that they have ſhal be a divel to them, eſpecially
to thoſe that do not give up and ſay to their poor fellow-creatures,
theſe oxen, and cowes, horſes, bread, wine, corn, cloath, and
all things are yours, as wel as mine, but when I have brought you
out from amongſt them, even into your own countrie, then you
ſhal be at reſt; for it is <hi>Sion,</hi> the place that I have choſen to dwel
in, and wil dwel in, even in your O Sion, whom I will by my
ſtrong hand bring back into your own land, even you Jews
which at the preſent ſeems to be a people ſcattered and peeled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
other people, even you wil I bring, with the fulneſs of the
Gentiles; and wil make you rejoyce, and ſing, and leap for joy, for
the Lord, the king, <hi>the holy one of Iſrael is in thee,</hi> even in every one of
you, <hi>and none of you ſhall ſee evill any more;</hi> O what a bundance of joy
wil here be! O you Jews naturall, that have a long time bin ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
but are now called in, and grafted into the true vine again, and
for you alſo that are gentils by name, but are taken up with the
love and favour of God, even I the mightie Iehovah, for you ſhall
be both of you united together, and be but one body and ſpouſe
of the King of glory: from whom I the King of glory have wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
away all evil, and you <hi>ſhall ſee ſorrow no more;</hi> but ſhal rejoyce
in me, <hi>as a bride doth in the bridegroom,</hi> and ſo alſo will I rejoice
in you, as my wife and Bride and thee only in whom I do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52339:21"/>
to dwel, when others ſhal be tormented and grieved with
my ſore diſpleaſure, and with that work, I am about for to make
them do: which is for to make the riches which they have made
gods of, become devils to torment them that they may remember
the words of <hi>Paul, the time is coming that they ſhall uſe the world as if they
uſed it not:</hi> but O you rich ones, how do you do at this ſaying,
<hi>you muſt uſe the world as if you uſed it not?</hi> which if you did, you
would not do as now you do, lay up treaſures for the ruſt and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
to get at, to be a witneſs againſt you, or for you; to lay
up great ſtore of riches, is to uſe the world as if you would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
part from it, or as if that ſhould never be taken from you, which
I tel you, it muſt be taken from you, and you alſo made to throw
away your gods of gold and ſilver, and alſo all other things, as to
claim no right to them more then another man; in ſo doing you
may be ſaid <hi>to uſe the world as if you uſed it not,</hi> and not while you do
ſo, wil this ſaying be fulfilled which ſhal ſurely come to paſs, <hi>for
the faſhion of this world paſſeth away,</hi> but how may it be ſaid, <hi>that the
faſhion of this world</hi> goeth away? the faſhion of this world paſſeth
away when that which was once in high eſteem goeth out, and
inſtead thereof there cometh a thing that is in oppoſition of what
was before; that which was highly eſteemed of before, now grows
out of date, and that which was not before comes now in, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion
of this world hath bin in whole and in generall amongſt all
ſorts of men under what notion of religion ſoever, to get riches and
ſtrive after them with all eagerneſs, as may be thereby thinking to
get in eſtimation of the world, and ſo to be in great eſteem among
the rich ones of the earth, and alſo <hi>the faſhion of this world</hi> hath bin
to ly, couſen, and cheat, and alſo to make war one with another,
one fighting againſt the other, with all might and ſtrength, and
only through a ſelf and private intereſt, which hath occaſioned
ſo much blood to be ſpilt, and alſo hath occaſioned many poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
to ſtarve for want of food, and others have bin driven to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
poverty, as to ſteal for ſomething whereby to keep life in the
body, and all this hath bin done by the pleaſure of my own ſelf,
even I the Lord of hoſt, who hath and wil ſuffer the things of my
appointment to run their own courſe, until they come to their end,
but now theſe things being allmoſt at an end, the word muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
new, new in reſpect of what is now a coming on the world,
that as the world hath former ly ſtrived after, ſhal now become
lothſome and abominable &amp; moſt men ſhal ſee &amp; know it to be ſo,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52339:21"/>
for riches ſhal now be a hook which ſhall be readie to choak,
thoſe that have them, and ſo they ſhall ſee their folly in laying up
treaſurs for they know not who; for what treaſurs ſoever, or
how much ſoever they be, muſt now be brought out; for the day
of the Lord is at hand, which will conſume all things beſides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and ſo wil make that a plague which formerly hath bin the
joy and delight of moſt men, even of all men: for <hi>former things are
paſſed away, and all things muſt become new,</hi> for this Ieruſalem mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſo often in ſcripture, muſt now be eſtabliſhed above the hils
and mountains, which formerly hath bin kept under by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of man, <hi>but the world paſſeth away,</hi> gold and ſilver that hath bin
made gods of, wil now be as plenty as it was in <hi>Solomons</hi> daies, and
as there were no beggers in Iſrael, ſo now there ſhal be none to beg
any more; for former things are paſſed away, the ſaying this is
mine, and this is mine, ſhal not long continue; but at the end
there ſhal be a change, which ſhal be very ſuddenly, to the amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all world-lings, and thoſe that make riches their god,
for theſe things go out of date, for now the time is at hand that
we ſhall follow the practiſe of the Apoſtles, and ſo ſhal hear them
preach, <hi>and to break bread from houſe to houſe with ſingleneſs of heart,</hi>
and ſo ſhal not ſo much look to our ſelves, as to let others be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
no, but we ſhal ſee to others, that they ſhal be in no want,
and ſo ſhal have no want of any thing, which if we do, then ſhal
we not only talke of <hi>denying our ſelves,</hi> but we ſhall wholy deny our
ſelves, and ſhal not ſeek our own good, our own I ſay, and not
another, but with all willingneſs ſeek the good of others, as being fellow-creatures,
and all of one blood, made of one and the ſame
mettal; then ſhal wars and contention ceaſe, and nothing but
love grow and increaſe, and ſpring forth in abundance; for I the
Lord of hoſt wil make all my enemies to ly down and be at reſt
one with the other, ſo that they ſhal ly like a lamb and a ſheep to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
and as for bears and wolves, they ſhal be taken away, that
there may be no devouring, but there may be perfect peace, and
love one with another; for though I do gather my Saints out of
all nations to go to one place, even to Jeruſalem, ſo that they
ſhal be freed from their cruel enemies, yet wil I alſo make ſuch
a work in all the earth, that oppreſſion ſhal ceaſe amongſt them; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
thoſe that are not brought into my love and favour, ſhal live
and be quiet one with the other, and ſhal have all things common;

me, even ſo much, that they ſhal ſee and know that they poſſeſs
all things, and enjoy all things, and ſo have all things at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;
for this tree of life is my ſelf, which if a man eats of, <hi>he

may be taken two waies, either myſtical, or literal, myſtically,
the Saints makes one City, literally, it is the Jeruſalem where
my ſons and daughters ſhal be gathered together; the gates of this
City is my power, which all muſt be indued with before they can
enter into it: for the tree of life is my ſelf, which will be there
for ever, keeping of them, my ſons and daughters alwaies in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
ſupply, ſo that they ſhal have no want of anything, but
<hi>the riches of the Gentils</hi> ſhal be brought into this City, even into this

righteouſneſs ſhal dwel there, nothing but the pure &amp; choſen veſſels
of my love ſhal be there even with ſinging, &amp; dancing ſhal they come

the poor of the people ſhal truſt in it: <hi>O Sion ſhout, ſhout and ſing for joy,
for all people ſhall tremble and quake for fear of thee,</hi> even for fear of thy
moſt excellent King, I the mighty Iehovah that dwels in thee, and I
wil make thee to be famous, and thee to be deſired far among all
people; this word ſhout, ſhewes abundance of joy, joy unſpeakable
in thee, ſhout and be glad, nothing but rejoyce and ſing: let ſorrow
and ſighing, and whatſoever hath formerly troubled thee, be now
turned into joy and gladneſs; I tel thee, that thou ſhalt be made
the praiſe of the whole earth; even thou (O Sion) that hath bin
ſcattered and driven into all nations, here and there one, but now
I have founded Sion, even thee, O Sion, wherein I do delight to
dwel, and will bring thee into my own place, even into a Canaan of
reſt, from all thy hateful enemies; ſo that thou ſhalt no longer
be here and thereon, no, but I wil bring you all together, both Iews

and wil be married to you, and you ſhal be my ſpouſe, and my

make you live for ever: for all my joy and delight ſhal be in you,
and I wil be your <hi>tower, and rock, and wals, and ſalvation</hi> for you; and
in that day you ſhal ſay, <hi>we have a ſtrong City; ſalvation will God appoint

Kings and Princes that ſhal reigne here on earth, every one of
you no leſs then a King, that ſhal have all nations in ſubjection to

make you to break the nations in peices <hi>like potters veſſels,</hi> even into,
ſhivers ſhalt thou daſh all thine enemies, whether they be Turk or:

&amp; I in the midſt of you wil ſhew my ſelf to be ſtrong and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
even ſo ſtrong, that I wil make all nations to be ſilent, and ſit
ſtil, and let you alone, and inſtead of making wars againſt you,
they <hi>ſhall beat their ſwords, and ſpears, and their weapons of war into pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
hooks, and the nations ſhall not learn war any more;</hi> but I wil make
them ſay, <hi>come let us go up to Sion, and they will teach us their waies</hi>
O what a bundance of glory wil <hi>I</hi> give unto thee O Sion, that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
far and near ſhal come up to thee to be taught of thee; and
indeed they ſhall have great need, for I wil empty all other teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of men, and all ſhal be barren, ſo that there ſhal be no perfect
reſt but to thoſe that come to Sion, where <hi>I</hi> the Lord of hoſt wil
be the a lone teacher, <hi>and wil make them all to know me, even from the leaſt
to the greateſt;</hi> not only know me, and cal me God, becauſe of my
power being ſeen, in that I have made the heavens and the earth,
for this knowledge of me all men have, yet they are ignorant of
what I am; which my people that dwel in Sion ſhal know; they
ſhal ſee me in my glory, and know me what and where I be, they
ſhal ſee me every where, and know that I am in every thing, and
that the whole world is but a garment to cover me from the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſight of men: and thus wil <hi>I</hi> appear in my people, gathering
them together, where I wil manifeſt my ſelf unto them, and raiſe
them from the dead, even all Iſrael from this death of ſin and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuption;
and wil make them to be partakers of the ſecond reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<hi>on which the firſt death ſhall have no power;</hi> and ſo all Iſrael,
even the whole houſe of Iſrael, ſhal be gathered together in <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
and in truth,</hi> and they ſhal glory and rejoyce in me, even in
mount Sion; yea even the place where my ſon Jeſus was transfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured
and changed, ſo that his raiment became white and gliſtering,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52339:23"/>
and the two Apoſtles ſeeing of him in this condition, ſaid <hi>it is good to
be here; for</hi> the glory that was ſeen there, which was but a reſemblance
of my gathering my people to Sion, and ſo making them to be as
one, and when I had ſo gathered them together in the laſt daies,
there to make my glory ſhine in a more luſtrious and glorious
manner then ever I did when my ſon Jeſus was on the earth, for
his being transfigured and ſhining ſo bright, ſhews forth abundance
of light and glory that ſhal be manifeſted to you now in theſe laſt
daies; for as ſoon as he was in garments that were white and
gliſtering, it ſhewes that I wil appear to be a light, and a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
light to you then yet I have bin, for the glory was ſo great
at the transfiguration of my ſon, that made his diſciples <hi>ſay, it was
good for them to be there:</hi> even ſo ſhal my appearing in you and gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threing
of you together, ſhining in you, and among you in ſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
a manner, rocking you a ſleep in my glory, ſhal make you ſay
<hi>it is good for us to be here,</hi> even in this place where it is thy pleaſure
we ſhal be; for here ſhal we be in the ſame condition as the two diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples
were in; for at the transfiguring of thy ſelf, made them to
ſay, <hi>it was good for to be here,</hi> by reaſon of the more tranſcendent glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
they ſaw far more then they did before, notwithſtanding they
had a long time bin in Jeſus his companie; ſo that notwithſtanding
thoſe glorious diſcoveries which you have had of me, and thoſe
glorious breakings forth of light which hath bin among you, wil
appear to be nothing in compariſon of that light and glory you
ſhal have when you are taken apart from the people, as the two A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
were had in the mount, even then ſhalt thou ſee a more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
diſcovery of me, when thou art taken wholy out of Babylon,
and wholy from all thy enemies, and brought up into the mount
even into Jeruſalem the place which I wil adorne with all manner
of precious things; <hi>as jewels of gold, and pearles and precious, ſtones of all
ſorts:</hi> and I wil change theſe glimpes of light and glory which
thou now haſt, and theſe little ſparkes of light, into a full and
perfect view, wherein thou maiſt ſee clearly my light and glory,
and ſo theſe ſparkes become coales of fire that ſhall appear in a
more fuller manner to thee then ever they did before; which wil
be in ſuch an extraordinary manner that al things elſe ſhal become
nothing in compariſon of this glory which I wil now make you
to ſee.</p>
            <p>And whereas Jeſus was transfigured before his two diſciples, and
they ſaw him in glory, and he was not alone in this condition but
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52339:23"/>
they did ſee <hi>Moſes and Elias talking with him,</hi> this is a miſtery which
ſhewes, that I the Lord of hoſt appearing in my bright and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
diſpenſations, which wil now be, I ſhal appear alone; but as
Moſes and Elias was with Chriſt when, he was transfigured, even
ſo ſhal Moſes and Elias now be with me in my bright appearing to
you; and not only Moſes and Elias, but all that have bin my
faithful ſervants, even the whole houſe of Iſrael ſhal appear in
glory, and you ſhal ſee and know them that they are Moſes and
Elias, and the reſt of my Saints, whom I have now raiſed up to
come and be with you, and have given them a body as I have ſeen
good, and <hi>Enoch</hi> of old propheſied; <hi>the Lord cometh with ten thouſand of
his Saints,</hi> ſo now wil I come (not only with ten thouſand, but) with
all my Saints to gard and keep me company, and ſo wil make my
name a glorious name, and a memorial for ever; and I thus appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in glory and majeſty, wil make all my enemies to tremble
and to quake, when they ſhal hear that I the Lord doth
raign in mount Sion, and that I have brought <hi>Moſes and Elias,</hi> and
all the reſt of the prophets thither: there for to make thee rejoyce
in me the Lord of hoſt, clothing them with my ſelf, and making
them for to appear in glory, giving them a revvard, that they ſhal
come and be in my love and favour, and that they ſhal now rule
over all their enemies, and all their enemies ſhal be but their foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool,
and they ſhal now tread and trample that wicked ſpirit
which hath often perſecuted them, to nothing; and ſo now ſhal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to be Kings and conquerours through me that love them: here
is but a glimps of that glory which you ſhal enjoy when you come
to Sion, when you ſee me and all my Saints with me, rejoycing in
me, and I in them; but how ever know this, <hi>that Sion ſhall be made
the praiſe of the whole earth, and all glory ſhal be there,</hi> even all manner
of precious things; and all the nations ſhal ly down in their duſt
and be brought to ſhame and confuſion and the Lord alone ſhal be
exalted, and wil magnifie himſelf, and wil get him glory and
honour over all his enmies, and ſo wil bring to nothing all thoſe
that have oppoſed him, and wil make Sion a <hi>ſcourge and a torment,</hi>
that ſhal torment all nations, when they hear of the love and
favour that I wil do to them, and when they hear of that glory and
beauty that I wil make to ſhine amongſt them; and when they hear
of that priviledge that I wil give you, O you Sion! that you ſhal
alwaies rejoyce, and ſing, and ſhal dwel in peace, <hi>and he of one heart,
and of one minde,</hi> glorying in me, and rejoycing in me, and bleſſing
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52339:24"/>
your ſelves in my name; and ſhal ſee nothing but joy <hi>for former
things be paſſed away, and all things now become new,</hi> nothing but
righteouſneſſe dwelling among you, and the glory of me the Lord
of hoſt overſhadowing you, and keeping of you from ſorrow and
weeping; <hi>having redeemed you out of the hands of them that were ſtronger
then you,</hi> and have made you now ſtronger then all your enemies,
<hi>and all ſhall lick the duſt of the ſoles of thy feet,</hi> and cal thee, <hi>the Sion of
the Lord, the holy one of Iſrael; and whereas thou haſt been forſaken that no
man went through thee;</hi> I wil make thee the glory and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of many Generations <hi>even the joy and delight of the whole world:</hi>
a place wherein there ſhal be nothing but ſinging and rejoycing
in God; even in me the Lord of hoſt, who am <hi>the All of all things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Lord ſaid within me, behold, &amp; I looked &amp; there appeared
three Suns; and they were one above another; the loweſt was not
ſo glorious as the midlemoſt, neither was the midlemoſt ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
as the higheſt; for the higheſt of them did outſtrip the other
in glory; and did ſhine ſo gloriouſly, that it did darken and put
out the light of both the reſt; for I did ſee that the midlemoſt had
put out the light of the firſt, even ſo that it did ſcarſe ſhine; but
the higheſt did ſo gloriouſly ſhine in ſuch a bright manner, that
the leſſer lights were but darkneſs to that. And I ſaid, Lord,
what meaneth theſe Suns, and one to be ſo bright over the other,
and ſo to darken the reſt? and my God ſaid, that theſe three Suns
hold forth three diſpenſations, one of them more glorious then
the reſt, and as they do appear unto you in glory, ſo did they ſhine
for the time of their being; and the firſt Sun doth hold forth the
firſt diſpenſation, even that, which was given by me the Lord of
hoſt to Moſes, even that law that was written in Tables of ſtone,
and the children of Iſrael had amongſt them; therefore as I did
appear to my ſervant Moſes in ſuch away as to give him a table of
ſtone wherein was written all my ſtatutes, lawes and judgements,
as I commanded my people Iſrael to obſerve and keep, as the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
of the ſeventh day, and the offering of ſacrifices, and the
ſlaying of the paſcall lamb, and the giving of them by tribes an
inheritance, that they ſhould not deal with other nations, as to
make marchandiſe with them, were but all tipes and figures of the
appearing of my ſon Chriſt in fleſh; and ſo it was but a darke
diſpenſation, in regard that it was but a diſpenſation that did
hold forth Chriſt to come in the fleſh; and thoſe that lived under
it at that time until Chriſt had lawes and commandements for to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52339:24"/>
obſerve; which they were never able to keep or fulfil; ſo in this reſpect
it did ſhine gloriouſly for the during or continuance of that time
they were to continue; becauſe they my people Iſrael, had lawes and
ordinances which all the nations beſides them had not, and ſo God
did not deal with other people as he did deal with them; as the
pſalmiſt ſaies, <hi>God hath not dealt ſo with other nations as he hath dealt with
us:</hi> that was in regard of my love and favour which I had to them as
for to make choiſe of them at the firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; ſo did take them as a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
people from the nations, to whom I did commit my Oracles:
yet this was but a weake diſpenſation, becauſe it could not give
life to them that did keep them; but thoſe that were in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of me the Lord of hoſt, it was by looking to my promiſe;
even to Ieſus Chriſt, which I did promiſe life by; and ſo when
the fulneſs of time came, that my ſon Ieſus was to be made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
in fleſh, and was borne, then the diſpenſation of types and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
ceaſed, and was not to be; but was put out by the appearing
of the Second Sun; which was the ſecond adminiſtration, even
Chriſt a Saviour coming in fleſh amongſt man, and ſo was by power
declared to be the Son of God; herein even I the Lord of hoſt did
appear moſt gloriouſly to the people in that age, by giving of my
ſon Ieſus and his diſciples povver to do and work miracles, which
continued ſo long as my ſon was viſible amongſt them in fleſh, and
then it ceaſed as he ceaſed from being amongſt them; and this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration,
was to continue for a time, as Moſes were, for all
the lawes, and waies, and rules that are contained in this ſecond ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration,
as given out by Ieſus in the fleſh as he were, was
but to continue for a time; which time was to laſt ſo long until all
the Kingdome ſhal be delivered up into the hand of the Father,
that he might be all and in all; that is at the end of this admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration,
I wil take the power uuto my ſelf that is I wil make my
ſelf manifeſt in ſuch an extraordinary way or manner, as wil ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to the confounding or putting out all other lights beſides my
ſelf; as the third Sun did appear very glorious to the reſt, ſo wil
I in this adminiſtration of making out my ſelf, or preaching my
ſelf in my ſons and daughters, make my glory for to ſhine in a
more extraordinary manner then before I did, for though I by my
bright appearing in my ſons and daughters, and in the world, at
the time that my ſon was on the earth, did ſo powerfully operate
in them, as that they muſt needs hold forth my Image of love, for it
is love that holds me forth more then any thing, and love it is that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52339:25"/>
is the Image of God, and I the God of gods did make them ſhew
love one unto the other, by making them give bread one to the
other, as they did; And ſo went from houſe to houſe and break
bread together and had all things common, this was but a tipe
of that great work which I wil now do, as for to make not only
my ſons and daughters live in love and peace, and union, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
wil make their enemies to be at peace with them, and wil
make them weary of their Idol gods, as gold, and ſilver, and ſo
wil take from them that oppreſſion that hath raigned from
time to time; and this I vvil do in my bright appearing in my
ſons and daughters, that ſhal ſee me to be their life and joy, and
ſo to have nothing in worth or eſteem beſides my ſelf, and ſo wil
make them to be the City or temple that ſhall have no need of
mens light, or candle-light; but I, even I their God, will be
their light, and ſo wil ſpeak and preach in them peace and joy,
and ſo wil free them not only from looking after creature objects,
but wil wholly draw them up to live in me, and wil make them to
ſee that they are dead, and cannot eat or do any thing, but all their
life is I the eternal God dwelling in them, and cauſing them <hi>to
hear a word behind them ſaying, this is the way walke in it;</hi> and ſo the new
Covenant ſhal be written in their hearts, <hi>they ſhall all know me from
the leaſt to the greateſt, and they ſhall ſin no more:</hi> at by my bright appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or making out of my ſelf to my people, I wil make them to
know me, and all the reſt ſhal know me, for I wil be a terror and
a dread to them, and ſo wil make them to be afraid of me, and
know me by my power that I will exerciſe over them, when my ſons
and daughters, even the new Jeruſalem, ſhal ſee <hi>former things paſſed
away, and all things become new;</hi> all thoſe things which formerly
were ſin to them, and did trouble them, to be no longer ſo, but
new, and <hi>all ſorrow to ſtay away:</hi> then it wil and ſhal be to them that
laugh and mock and revile my Saints now, a fear and a dread,
whereby they ſhal be in miſery and in pain for doing ſo as they
have done, for I wil appear very glorious in my ſons and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
I will deſtroy them all, even all their enemies, even with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
and without, ſo that they ſhal not ſin, but ſhal be wholly ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in liberty and freedome, and ſhal do nothing but my pleaſure,
and I wil joy in them, and they ſhal joy in me for evermore.</p>
            <p>So that in this third and laſt diſpenſation, God wil appear ſo
gloriouſly in his people, that thoſe that God is not wel pleaſed for
to make out himſelf in love unto, ſhall acknowledge that theſe
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52339:25"/>
are the ſons and daughters of God, and ſo ſhal cal us even the
Saints, <hi>the miniſters of Cod, and the Preists of the Lord,</hi> ſuch whom the
Lord hath raiſed up to be reſtorers of the breaches, and making of
pathes for to dwel in; for my work is now to make a ſeperation
for them, ſays the Prophet; then ſhal ye return and diſcern betwixt
the godly and the wicked, for I the Lord of hoſt in this laſt age
wil make a clear diſtinction, by manifeſting my power, and by
deſtroying all things beſides my ſelf; ſo that I wil make my Saints
to ſhine as ſtars in the Firmament, by my bright appearing in them;
for I the <hi>day ſtar, being riſen in their hearts,</hi> wil occaſion all darkneſs
to vaniſh away, and will make them ſhine ſo gloriouſly, by giving
them a new name, <hi>which none ſhall know, but them that have it;</hi> for I wil
make up my Jevvels in that day, and wil make them to ſhine illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriouſly,
that I wil make the wicked acknowledge of a truth, that
God, even the eternal God, dwels in them, and wil now be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped
in ſpirit and in truth, without forms, and rules, and ways,
which hath already been: but by my teaching in them, I wil make
them to give up themſelves to me; and ſo to rejoyce in me more
then ever they have done as yet, I wil fil them with my ſpirit, for I
being of as great power as I was of old, ſo that they ſhall now ſee
and know with cleerneſs, and ſpeak as the ſpirit moves them,
and talk as I act in them, even in ſuch a ſure way as my ſervants
the prophets did of old, for my <hi>hands are not yet ſhortned,</hi> but can do
ſuch a work ſtil as to make my Saints no longer doubt and queſtion
what they ſay, but ſhal ſurely ſay the Lord ſpeaketh thus, and ſo ſhal
ſpeake infallible once again, and not to doubt, as they do now,
and have formerly; for I wil now open that myſtery that hath been
ſealed up with ſeven ſeals, as a token of darkneſs, yea perfect
darkneſs: which myſtery wil be opened now the ſeven laſt trumpets
ſound, and the laſt Vial is now a pouring forth, which myſtery is
only God appearing to <hi>All in all;</hi> and I the God, even the eternal
King, taking my power my ſelf, as to make all become ſubject to
me, and not to formes, and ſo to make my ſelf known that I dwel
in men, and ſo wil preach in men, and wil cauſe other preaching
which hath been in my offence to ceaſe; and I alone wil preach
and ſpeak to men, and wil tel them <hi>this is the way walke in it, when
they turn to the right hand or to the left hand,</hi> when they are going aſtray
from me, then I wil ſpeak to them for to make them come in the
way which I would have them to walke in; which if rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
wil make my ſons and daughters greatly for to rejoice to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52339:26"/>
ſee their God eie to eie, or to hear him ſpeak in them, it wil
ſave abundance of trouble; as it wil make them leave off runing
after <hi>broken ciſterns that can hold no water;</hi> and alſo from runing from
mountain to hil, and ſo finding no reſting place: O ſaints here is
a reſting place for you, leave off gadding abroad, and runing after
other lovers, for I am your reſt, and your dwelling, and be ſilent
and ſit ſtil, and I wil ſpeak in you, yea even I wil ſpeak peace to
you, <hi>and no good thing I will withhold from you;</hi> and I wil ſhew
you where I make <hi>my flock to reſt and ly down at noon days,</hi> and
where I lead them to the lively fountain of living waters: O this
place of reſt, and place where I make my flock to reſt, is for to
bring them up in to me and then they ſhal finde a Canaan, a reſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
and a river of <hi>living water,</hi> which ſhal never be drie, but alwaies
flowing forth with life and nouriſhing, joy and comfort to you
that are thus brought up from all creatures, and ſo only wait for
the ſpeakings of me the Lord hoſt in you, which I wil ſurely do
to the abundance ſatisfaction of your ſoules; and you ſhal hear of
it, and ſo ſhal ly down in <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">

outward things, and none ſhal come.</p>
            <p>And I ſaw a viſion wherein is ſhewed that there ſhal be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out of this land a people that ſhal go to Jeruſalem, and alſo
the Iewes that are diſperſed in all nations ſhal be gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

might be fulfilled, <hi>that all nations ſhal go and worſhip at Jeruſalem,</hi>
the viſion is as followeth.</p>
            <p>There did appear a pair of ſcales, and within each ſeale a weight,
one of them being a great deal bigger then the other, and it was
to me like lead; and the other being a little one, and like unto
ſilver, was too light for the other for a while, and ſo the great
one weighed it up, and held it for a while up; but at length the
ſcales turned, and the little weight weighed up the great weight;
and the great weight fel to the earth, and was no more.</p>
            <p>And I beheld that out of this little weight there came men and
women, and I ſaid, Lord, what meaneth this ſcale, and the
hand that holds them up, and the weights in them? and my God
even the eternal King of glory ſaid, the ſcales ſignifie the earth, in
whole the material frame of heaven and of earth, and the hand
by which the ſcales were held, is ſhown my power by which I have
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52339:26"/>
erected them and ſo doth ſtil hold them up from falling down, the
weights ſignifie two peoples, or two powers, the wicked and the
Godly, or the earthly powers, or my power; by the great weight
is ſet forth the earthly powers, and alſo wicked men, which
have had powers and have ruled over my ſons and daughters a great
while, as was ſhewed thee by weighing up the little weight; and
ſo have kept my people in bondage and ſlavery to one thing or
other, as to the rudiments of this world, and traditions of men;
but as the ſcale turned, it ſhewes a turning of things upſide down,
and as the little weight waighed the great one up, for as much as by
the little one is meant my ſons and daughters; and made the
great one fall to the earth, and ſo to be no longer, is ſhown a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of thoſe thieves that were, and that which were not, is
now to come to paſs; as the powers of the earth and wicked men
have ruled over my Saints, the time is now come, they ſhal do ſo
no longer, but muſt become ſubject to my people; for the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
of the world ſhal <hi>I now give to my ſaints,</hi> and they ſhal poſſeſs
them for ever, and all the might, and majeſty, and glory, and ſtrength
of men, ſhal be nothing in my ſight, for I wil bring down <hi>the proud and
haughty looks of men,</hi> and wil lay them low, even to the duſt, that they
may no longer be; <hi>for I will now ſtain all the pride and glory of man,</hi> and
make man appear to be but duſt and of no ſtrength, that I the Lord
of hoſt may be exalted, and ſo become all the povver and ſtrength
of men.</p>
            <p>And whereas thou didſt ſee men &amp; women come out of the little
weight, &amp; ſprad themſelves abroad, &amp; as they went darkneſs vaniſhed
away and light encreaſed much; theſe people are my Sons and
Daughters, vvhom I vvil ſtir up to go to Jeruſalem; and out of
this nation there ſhal go ſome, even the principal and chiefe leader
of them ſhal be an Engliſh man, vvhom I have already choſen for
to do the vvork of me: and alſo vvil I at this appearing ſtir up the
Jevvs that are of the natural ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to go vvith him in
their ovvn country; and I did ſee alſo that vve that ſhould go up
ſhould meet vvith many enemies, as Moſes did vvhen he brought
the Children of Iſrael out of Egypt, before they could get
into Canaan; but as God deſtroyed them all before Moſes, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua
and made vvay for his people then; even ſo vvil he novv
do the like, for he hath choſen one vvhich he hath indued vvith
povver and courage (like <hi>Moſes)</hi> to be a leader, and God himſelf
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52339:27"/>
vvil fight our battels, ſo that al our enemies ſhal be made a prey to us
in vvhat country ſoever vve paſs through; and vvhen God ſhal be
pleaſed for to bring us up to Jeruſalem, then the Lord vvil make all
the inhabitants to run avvay, and ſo the <hi>All of all things</hi> vvil give
us houſes that vve builded not, for to dvvel in, and orchards and
vinyard: vvhich vve planted not, for to eat the fruit thereof: and
alſo in this viſion there vvas ſhevved me one that vvas meaſuring a
place, and it vvas to build a material temple, and the Lord ſaid it
ſhould be built, and I did ſee it built, and it vvas like unto <hi>Pauls,</hi>
and there vve vvere to meete tvvice or thrice, and then it ſhould
be deſtroyed; and of a ſudden I ſavv it deſtroyed and laid deſolate,
that vve ſhould no longer meete there in that Material temple; but
ſhould worſhip God even the eternal King of glory, in ſpirit; and
preſently after this, I ſavv al that vvere there, both men and vvo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
fal dovvn to the ground as if they vvere dead; but of a ſudden
I did ſee them all riſe up, and ſo vvere as it vvere changed to a more
glorious people then they vvere before, and they ſhould never dy
more; and after this, there vvent a lavv out from amongſt them
into all Nations and countries, <hi>for a law ſhall go out of Sion,</hi> and ſo
theſe vvere ſhevved me to be the Bride, <hi>the Lambs ſpouſe and wife,</hi> to
vvhom all Nations ſhal become ſubject, and ſhal not lift up
hand or foot againſt them, for they ſhal be a terror to all the earth,
and all the earth ſhal be afraid of them, and ſhal vvillingly let theſe
that are aftervvards a coming up, come up vvith eaſe and quietneſs,
and help them forvvard in their vvay; after this I ſavv all <hi>tears were
wiped from them,</hi> and they ſhould ſorrovv and vveep no more;
<hi>but all things are now to them become new, and everlaſting joy and gladneſs of
heart,</hi> ſinging and rejoicing in God; God ſpeaking in them, and
teaching them, and being the light of them, both by day and night,
ſo as all darkneſs ſhall vaniſh avvay, and all become light; and ſo
they ſhal <hi>all of them be of one heart and one minde;</hi> and after <hi>I</hi> looked
and beheld, and I could ſee nothing but pleaſant Orchards &amp; Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,
ful of fruit, and making a moſt pleaſant ſmel, and all there
food after this change vvas nothing but the fruit of the trees, and
that they may have at any time, for as faſt as one vvas pulled off,
another appeared in the roome preſently, and ſo there vvas abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of plenty, and joy, and pleaſant muſick, and no more ſorrovv
and ſighing; but all rejoicing, freed from ſickneſs and pain, &amp;
living in the I enjoyment of eternity; &amp; the joy and glory of this

And again my eternal God ſaid unto me, behold, what doſt
thou now ſee? and loe I looked, and there appeared a woman all
in white; and preſently after the woman, there appeared a man,
and he took the woman and carried her round about the room;
and when he had brought her round, he brought her in the midle of
the room, and ſet her upon a high place, even the higheſt in the
room; and I ſaid, Lord, what doth this woman ſet forth unto
me? and the eternal God, even my father, the King of eternal glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
ſaid, this woman doth repreſent my Church, my ſpouſe,
my wife, even my peculiar and choiſe ones, whom I have brought
up to ſee and know me, as I am the eternall being of all things,
and how all things have their right being from me, who am the
life all things, and for whom all things were made and created;
and as ſhe was in white, it doth ſet forth, that I the eternal God
have waſhed her from all her ſins, and have taken her from all her
foulneſs, and ſo have made her white, even ſo white, that ſhe
ſhal ſee and know now that all her ſins and iniquities are pardoned

wil be controuled by none; but wil do what I pleaſe for to do, and
who are they that ſhal hinder me from doing of my pleaſure? and

ſorrow, by being ſcattered abroad in the world; but I who am
your life and light, even I the <hi>mighty God of Jacob,</hi> am now riſen to
bring you into your own country, even together, <hi>ö daughter of Sion,
ſhout and rejoyce, and cry aloud, Sing and make merry,</hi> and be <hi>glad</hi> in your
King, who am now Riſen with mighty power, for to bring you
into your own land; therefore rejoyce and ſing, <hi>for thy light is come</hi>
&amp; Sion that vvas ſcattered abroad; but now ſhal be gathered into your
own country, even into <hi>Judea:</hi> for the glory of the Lord is riſen
upon you, even my glory is riſen upon thee, for to bring thee out
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:52339:29"/>
of a ſtrange country; and as Pilgrims and ſojourners into your
country, there for to make my glory and light ſhine and reſt upon
thee: <hi>for the glory of the Lord is riſen upon thee, even upon thee ö captive
daughter of Sion:</hi> for to make you ſee and know that I have purpoſed
to bring you into your own country once again, and there to make
thee <hi>the praiſe of the whole earth</hi> and the earth to ſee and know my pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
by which I do things, ſaith I the Lord of hoſt; who hath cauſed
my glory for to ariſe upon thee; for <hi>you have now a more ſurer word of
propheſie, to which you do well to take heed, as to a light that ſhineth in a
darke place, until the day dawn, and the day ſtar ariſe in your hearts:</hi> this
was given to the church in that age, who was to obſerve the word
of the Apoſtles then and at that time, they being but babes and
children, &amp; ſo had a rule for to walk by, which rule the Apoſtle bids
them take heed unto, that they walke by it: for how long? even ſaith
the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>until the day break,</hi> until there be ſome further appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of light, a more glorious diſpenſation then now is, <hi>and the day
ſtar in your harts,</hi> that is until you do ſee &amp; know God dwelling in you,
and ſo do ſee &amp; know Chriſt, <hi>who is the bright and morning ſtar:</hi> to be one
with the Father, Son, &amp; holy Ghoſt: but one God dwelling in you, who
is your life and ſtrength, and ſo to ſee this God in love, to be your
<hi>All and in all,</hi> and the very life of all things: til then you being
weake, have had need of a writen rule to walke by, but now you
have no longer need of any thing to walk by, no not the Scripture
to walk by; for I even your King and Lord, wil be unto you Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
and Law, and rule, and ways, and formes of worſhips, yea
I wil be all: <hi>ariſe and ſhine, for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord
is riſen upon thee,</hi> even my glory ſhall now ſhine upon thee, <hi>for to make
thee the praiſe of the whole earth,</hi> and the joy of all the nations, <hi>ariſe
and ſhine, for behold darkneſs ſhall cover the earth, and groſs darkneſs the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi>
ariſe, ſhine, your condition wil and ſhal be happy, ſaith I the
Lord of hoſt, who hath made my glory to ſhine upon you, even
upon you ö <hi>Sion;</hi> whom I wil gather into <hi>Judea</hi> from amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
people: but I wil tel you one thing, even you whom I do
gather up into <hi>Judea:</hi> for behold this, <hi>darkneſs ſhall cover the earth,
and groſs darkneſs the people:</hi> even when you ſhal ſee light, and walk
in light, and have light to be your guide, and have my glory ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon you, even then ſhal others, the earth, be covered with
darkneſs, for there ſhal be no clear light, and ſun ſhining upon the
earth, even upon thoſe that come not up to worſhip me the Lord
of hoſt in Jeruſalem, but inſtead of light, there ſhal be darkneſs, and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:52339:30"/>
inſtead of breaking forth of light, there ſhal be a miſt and a cloud
that ſhal overſpread it ſelf for a while, ſo that they that go not up
to Jeruſalem ſhal not have that clear light, neither ſhal they ſee
and know that glory which I wil and ſhal make out to you ö Sion:
for you ö Sion ſhal eat, and drink, and be ful, <hi>and have the bread of life,
and water of life,</hi> when they that come not up ſhal be in want, and
ſhal be hungry, when Sion ſhal be ful; for I wil take away all their
food, even their formes and wayes of worſhip, and wil utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
them and bring them to nothing; for theſe things, as forms
of worſhip have they had ſome comfort in uſing them; but I wil
leave theſe diſpenſations wherein I have formerly appeared, and
wil make darkneſs cover the earth in this ſence, for I wil deprive
them of all their formes and Church governments; for I wil for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
them, and they ſhal receive no benefit by them, even dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
ſhal cover them, that they ſhal not ſee light in them, even
groſs darkneſs, even ſuch a darkneſs wil and ſhal light upon poor
creatures that walke by forms, and ſo think to be carried to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
upon the ſholders of their Prieſts; but darkneſs, yea ſuch dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
that both Prieſt and people ſhal be amaſed; for they ſhal be
driven out of their common-road, and ſo ſhal be forced to ſeek a
new way, even this darkneſs ſhal light upon thoſe that are malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and ful of envy, and ſo would of a ſudden deſtroy their fellow
creatures; darkneſs wil and ſhal overcome ſuch; for though they
preach and pray, yet al wil not ſave them, but that they muſt be
deſtroyed and brought to nothing; for ſaith the Lord of hoſt <hi>dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
ſhall cover the earth:</hi> there wil be no clear ſight of God, and no
clear ſight of my way: for they ſhal not come to my knowledge,
and ſo to the enjoyment of me here or in any place, but where Sion
ſhal be gathered together, even my people, whom I have raiſed
from the dead, and ſo wil bring them up to Sion, at Ieruſalem
the City where formerly I dwelt, which is in <hi>Judea,</hi> and there I
wil make them ſhine, and <hi>be the glory of the whole earth:</hi> and after
this firſt reſurrection that they ſhal have for to be raiſed from a
condition of death and ſlavery, into a condition of joy and life,
where the <hi>Second death ſhal have no power over them:</hi> for this is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
wherein I wil ſet you free from all death: and you ſhal
dy no more, for I wil be your life, and you ſhal live for evermore,
for now ſhal appear <hi>the ſign of the Son of man coming in the ayre:</hi> which
ſign of my coming, is now, foraſmuch as I the Lord of hoſt, doth
begin to declare unto my ſervants what I do now intend to do: for
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:52339:30"/>
this ayre where it is ſaid, <hi>then ſhall appear the ſign of the Son of man,</hi> is
not meant only the ayre above, but rather that ayre which is in
this earth of yours; for as your bodies are earthy, ſo are they
aëry, for they, even your bodys, are not compounded only of earth,
but of aire, and ſo I appearing in your bodies, and ſo making choice
of inſtruments for to do my work, <hi>and my ſtrange worke,</hi> that is my
ſign, or <hi>the ſign of the Son of man coming in the aire:</hi> which ſign is for to
give people warning of what I intend to do, that ſo if <hi>I</hi> find them
not doing what I would have them to do, they may the better be
judged by me: and ſo puniſhed for not doing of what I would have
them do, for the appearing of my ſign, is to declare unto them that
I am coming to judge and deſtroy all things in man, eſpecially in
my Saints, beſides my ſelf, and ſo to raiſe my ſon up from that
grave and place of impriſonment, as now for the preſent lies in:
even to reſtore her to life, that ſhe may dy no more: <hi>for bleſſed
are they that have part in the firſt reſurrection, on whom the ſecond death
ſhall have no power:</hi> it is a moſt joyful ſaying to them that have
themſelves raiſed up to be brought into ſuch a place where
they ſhall die no more: which will be at the place where I
have appointed to make my ſelf glorious; and ſo vvil appear in
my glory, and ſo make my povver knovvn, by being a God of povv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
vvho have raiſed up Sion from amongſt their enemies, and have
brought her into her ovvn land, even into a place vvhere ſhe my
wife and I muſt be married, and ſo they ſhal live for ever, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
dy no more, for my Sion ſhal be changed, &amp; ſo ſhal become nevv;
for the old man vvhich for the preſent they carry about them, ſhal
be deſtroyed, and the nevv man Chriſt ſhal come forth; and ſo they
ſhall live for ever, and never dy more; and ſo after this they ſhal
be <hi>as the Angels of God,</hi> as my ſon Chriſt ſaid, <hi>that ſhould neither marry or
be given in marrige</hi> but ſhal live in the ful enjoyment of me, vvho am
the Lord of hoſt, that lives for evermore, for vvhen they are brought
into the ful and perfect enjoyment of me, and be at peace vvith
themſelves, ſo as they ſhal never marry or give themſelvs in marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
according to the cuſtomes of us, novv theſe cuſtoms ſhall vvholy
be deſtroyed, and a nevv one ſhal come in, that they ſhall live in pure
and perfect enjoiment of me their creator, and ſo ſhal have the uſe of
thoſe vvhom I appoint together, and ſo ſhal have the uſe of one
another.</p>
            <p>For the Angels that neither marry or give themſelves in marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
are not any created ſubſtances beſides man, as to be in a place
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:52339:31"/>
above the skies, keeping of me company in one place: yea though
it is true, the Angels, the good angels as you cal them, that left
not their firſt eſtate, do keep me company, and are where I am, and
where I be there they be.</p>
            <p>For theſe Angels made mention of, and alſo them made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of in <hi>Peter,</hi> that left their firſt eſtate, and ſo are reſerved in
chaines of darkneſs unto the great day: are no other angels then
what is in man. For I the Lord of hoſt made man purely good, and
before he fel, he was holy, juſt, and upright, being a pure Angel of
mine, and ſo one that ſhould never dy if he had continued in the
condition as he was ſet in: but it was the pleaſure of I the creator
to ſet him in ſuch a condition as <hi>I</hi> knew wel enough he ſhould fal:
for had it been the pleaſure of I the Lord he ſhould have ſtood
and ſo have lived for ever; for if he had ſtood and lived for ever,
then ſhould not my power have bin ſeen ſo much as it is now: for
this <hi>Adam</hi> was made good and juſt; and all things in him, and
all things beſides him were good and not evil: but yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
out of this <hi>Adam</hi> who was made good and juſt, did
proceed a <hi>Serpent</hi> for to beguil <hi>Eve</hi> the weaker veſſel, and this <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent</hi>
was not a ſerpent, a creature that poiſons, and ſo lives as a
creature, no, but this <hi>Serpent</hi> was within <hi>Eve</hi> and <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo
was ſomthing from <hi>Adam</hi> degenerated from its inſtitution, from
what it ſhould be, to what it ſhould not be; and that is this, as
<hi>Adam</hi> was made good, and no evil was to be ſeen in him, as I the
Lord of hoſt hath declared at the firſt: but that I the Lord gave
him reaſon, and knowledge, and wiſdome, which in themſelves
were very good: for by theſe things he did differ from the beaſts,
and from every living creature; and by theſe things, as reaſon,
knowledge, and wiſdome, did he give unto every creature which I
the Lord God had made, and alſo did he know the nature of every
green herbe, and of every thing, as to give them a name.</p>
            <p>Thus was <hi>Adam</hi> in his firſt eſtate good, furniſhed with every
thing, and ſo did live in paradiſe, even in God, and ſo had the pure
and perfect enjoyment of the creator that made him; but it did
pleaſe me for to let him alone, and <hi>Eve</hi> eſpecially, being the
weaker veſſel and not able to contain her ſelf in that condition, as
to know much and do little: but ſhe did put her ſelf forward in a way
for to eat the apple that ſhe was commanded to let alone, for
ſhe had ſo much reaſon, wiſdome, and knowledge, as that ſhe knew
wel enough that if ſhe did eate of the fruit ſhe ſhould have bin as
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:52339:31"/>
God; and this the <hi>Serpent, who being a more ſubtil creature then any of
the beaſts of the field was,</hi> did urge <hi>Eve</hi> for to eat of the fruit: which
<hi>Serpent</hi> was no other but that reaſon, wiſdome, and knowledge,
which is the ſpirit of men, and women, and is in man very
good of it ſelf, if man had but power for to keep it under, from
going about to do that it ſhould not do; and this was the only
<hi>Serpent</hi> that made <hi>Eve</hi> to eat of the forbidden fruit: even that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
knowledge, and wiſdome that was in her, for that reaſon, and
knowledge, &amp; wiſdome, that was in her, did degenerat from what
it ſhould do, and did do what it ſhould not: the degenerating from
what it ſhould do, was its pride, by doing what it ſhould not do: as
it was given her for to know how ſhe ſhould keep &amp; perform that
ſhe had a command for to do. It was good in its ſelf, but inſtead
of keeping, ſhe breaks the command, &amp; that by being beguiled by the
Serpent; which is no other but her own reaſon, wiſdome, &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
as her God had given her, even I the creator: &amp; ſo this reaſon,
wiſdome, &amp; knowledge, which was a good Angel, &amp; the Angels of
God in <hi>Adam</hi> &amp; <hi>Eve,</hi> by knowing more then they ſhould have done,
and ſo by preſuming to go higher, even to be as God, like me their
creator, this reaſon, knowledge, and wiſdome, which was good
and the good Angels of God, even I the creator of all things did for
preſumption, turn it from what it was, even from a good an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
or ſpirit in man, into a <hi>Serpent,</hi> a wicked angel, an oppoſer of I
their creator; and ſo I did caſt this wicked angel, even this wicked
reaſon, knowledge, and wiſdome, which became wicked, for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming
to go higher then it ſhould have done, and ſo for this end
and purpoſe did I the creator caſt out this reaſon, wiſdome, and
knowledge, for oppoſing me in <hi>Eve,</hi> and in <hi>Adam,</hi> to be kept in
chaines and in bonds of darkneſs, until the day of judgement,
which chaines and bonds of darkneſs, is no other but giving it up
to its own courſe, and ſo to let it run its own race in runing from
me, and then giving it ever now and then a touch of my power
and glory, which I do cauſe them to behold in whom this <hi>Serpent</hi>
doth remain, and ſo doth cauſe it to receive torment from me, for
not making out my ſelf unto them.</p>
            <p>And ſo theſe Angels good and had are both in man; the good.
Angels are the ſpirits of juſt men, that give themſelves up to God,
and ſo their reaſon, knowledge, and wiſdome, which is the ſpirit
of man, are the good Angels of God, that are called miniſtring
ſpirits: &amp; theſe angels are always Gods companions, and ſo do keep
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:52339:32"/>
God, even I the <hi>All of all things</hi> company, and are alwayes with me,
and in me, I being their reſt and place of eaſe: for when any of my
Saints return from the earth, ſo that the body becomes to be duſt
again, then do I draw up the ſoul and its ſpirit to their centers,
whoſe centers is I the Lord of hoſt, who am the life of all men:
and their life is their ſoul, which muſt return to me again, I being
its fountain; and as for the ſpirit that returns to me when it leaves
the body of a Saint; for I am unto them reaſon, wiſdome, and
knowledge, and ſo their ſpirit in them anſwers to mine; which
becauſe it becomes ſubject to me, it is an Angel of light, and alſo
are Angels and miniſtring ſpirits, whom I the Lord of hoſt ſends
out to miniſter comfort to my people; and ſometimes in formes
and in ſhapes as I pleaſe; and ſometimes by making their ſpirits
anſwerable to mine, and ſo make them reſt in me; whence as the
body now lies in the grave, for ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>are not Angels
miniſtring ſpirits, ſet out to minister to them who ſhall be heits of ſalvation?</hi>
ſent out to them whom I wil pleaſe to ſend them to: ſo then the
good Angels, <hi>are the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect;</hi> and ſo ſaith the
Apoſtle, <hi>we are come to an innumerable company of Angels, even to the
ſpirits of juſt men made perfect,</hi> here you may ſee by your Scriptures
that Angels are but the ſpirits of juſt men, for juſt men made perfect
are Angels; ceaſing from labour and ſorrow, for to reſt in me the
<hi>All of all things,</hi> who am the life of all things; and ſo the angels in
ſcripture made mention of, are but the ſpirits of juſt men whom I
can make to appear in the form of a man, and what in power, or
otherwiſe in what ſhape or form I pleaſe, and ſo good Angels are
but the ſpirits of juſt men, even of my Saints which are deceaſed, or
now contiuing and abiding in me the Lord of hoſt.</p>
            <p>The bad angels that fel and are reſerved <hi>in chaines of darkneſs unto
the judgement day of the Lord of hoſt,</hi> is the <hi>Serpent</hi> that is in man, and
is the wiſdome, and reaſon, and knowledge, that is in man, which
is the ſpirit of man; and this reaſon, wiſdome, and knowledge,
which was made good, for all things were good, and ſo there
were no evil, this for becoming to exalt it ſelf, as to know more
then I was willing to let it know, did caſt it ſelf under my wrath, &amp;
ſo became a curſe, under which curſe it ſtil lies, and ſo wil remain
unto the judgement day: for this reaſon, and wiſdome that is in
man exalting it ſelf againſt God, and not becoming ſubject to God,
is the <hi>Serpent</hi> that beguiled <hi>Eve,</hi> and ſo it did <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo doth
and wil do until it be taken away: and for beguiling <hi>Eve</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:52339:32"/>
a ſerpent, and a wicked angel thrown out of heaven, that is,
out of the love and favour of I the Lord of hoſt, into darkneſs,
that is, into my ſore diſpleaſure: and not only a wicked angel, but
a divel, and ſo al wicked ſpirits are divels: for there were nothing
created evil, but all was made good; and this reaſon in man was
good if it had but kept his bounds wherein I had ſet it, but by
taking liberty to do what I would not have it do, it became at
enmity with me, and ſo became a divel and a deſtroyer, and ſo a
murderer; a deſtroyer and murderer in that it forſook me the
fountain of life, where it might have had reſt, and ſo have bin at
quiet, and ſo hath deſtroyed it ſelf and hath made it ſelf the very
curſe, and ſo is become the moſt odious and greateſt enemy to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
puffing it ſelf up, and wil not willingly be ſubject to I the Lord
of hoſt: though it is true I could make it become ſubject to me if
ſo be I would ſhew my infinite power for to bring it from the curſe,
even then would reaſon, wiſdome, and knowledge, which is the
ſpirit of man, and ſo conſequently, the divel if it oppoſes God:
become the greateſt joy and comfort to man: for the divel is evil
in it ſelf, not made a divel, but he became a divel by diſobedience,
it being the good pleaſure of I the Lord that it ſhould be ſo, and
ſo then the ſpirits of wicked men and women are witches and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels:
for as you read of men that <hi>were poſſeſſed with devils;</hi> and as
you read that <hi>Chriſt did caſt out devils:</hi> theſe devils are nothing but
the ſpirits of wicked men deceaſed; which as ſoon as they go out
of the body they are not at reſt, neither can they reſt or be at quiet,
but they are alwaies ſeeking about in whom they may enter; yea
though it be my pleaſure for to keep them out of all, yet I do not,
but do let them get into ſome, and there he becomes a worſe divel
then he were before, and ſo doth remain for the time of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
being; and after that ceaſes, it goeth into another; and theſe
are witches, even the ſpirits of wicked men are witches, and I make
uſe of them as my inſtruments to puniſh and plague other wicked
men in whom the ſame ſpirit remaines: and I do alſo allow unto
theſe witches power for to torment, as to bewitch the cattle of
men, for they in bewitching of them they dy; for it is my plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
to ſuffer this for a while: and theſe witches are the divel and
ſerpent mentioned; and the divel that Chriſt caſt forth which run
into the heard of ſwine, was no other ſpirit or divel but the ſpirit
and divel of a wicked man deceaſed: its going into the heard of
ſwine by asking Chriſt leave, ſhewes that it cannot go into any it
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:52339:33"/>
ſelf or what it doth, it doth it by having permiſſion from me to do
it, and ſo nothing is done but I muſt give way for it to be done, as
I gave way for the Divel that was caſt out, to go into the herd of
ſwine; which ſwine ſets forth wicked men, for nothing is more
like to a wicked man then a ſwine, for as a wicked man
wil drink and be drunk, ſo wil a ſwine ſwil til he burſts himſelf,
if he might be put to ſome ale or ſtrong beer; ſo that the Divel
being caſt out of a wicked man, and the man become a convert, there
is no place for him to be any longer, but the Divel begging to go
into the herd of ſwine, ſhewes his earneſt deſire to be in his ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
for the ſwine ſets forth wicked men, and ſo the divel that
was caſt forth went into the wicked men, even into its center from
whence it came.</p>
            <p>For the very riſe of this Divel, and alſo of wicked ſpirits which
are Divels, was not made by God, even by I the Lord of hoſt, to be
ſo, but they departing from good, and made the good which I
gave them evil, and ſo they became Divels, declining from doing
that which I commanded them to do; and ſo the very riſe and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
from whence the Divel came, was from man, his imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
being continually evil, though man could never do ſo much
as to do any thing contrary to me, but muſt of neceſſity do my plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;
for I only am active, and the creature only and alone paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive;
ſo that Divel that doth moſt torment men is God, who doth
give power unto wicked ſpirits for to puniſh them, and wicked ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
do nothing but what is the pleaſure of I their King, who ſuffers
them to do as they do, while the time runs round, and comes to
the ſame being and form as it was at the firſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the ſeed of the woman ſhall break the ſerpents head;</hi> this woman is
the Church, and ſo the ſeed is Chriſt in this Church; ſo then the
Chriſt which is the new man, ſhal in time riſe and break in peices
the old man, old <hi>Adam</hi> ſhal be deſtroyed and conſumed to nothing,
the <hi>Serpent</hi> whoſe head muſt be broke, is that reaſon, knowledge,
and wiſdome, even that <hi>Serpent</hi> and Divel that came in by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience,
and muſt be deſtroyed, and ſo caſt into the lake of fire;
for the day of judgement unto which this Divel is reſerved and
kept in chaines of darkneſs, is the day of my power, by which pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
I wil deſtroy and bring to nothing this Divel, for the day of
iudgement when I wil judge this Divel, it wil be my bright appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to confound the adverſary, and ſo to bring to nothing all the
ſerpentine wiſdome of the fleſh; and alſo all the cuning and craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:52339:33"/>
of the proud fleſh; for the chains inwhich this <hi>Serpent</hi> is reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
is nothing elſe, but that I do out give unto all that power and
ſtrength to come into its firſt ſtation where in it was ſet, which in
time I wil deſtroy al beſides theſe things, that ſhal appear gloriouſly
and ſhine by holding forth my glory, and wil make Chriſt the
new man, appear in power, ſpreading of it ſelf in all, for to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
all from this power of darkneſs, and wil make man to be as
he was at the firſt, taking away the Divel &amp; wicked ſpirits from man,
yea out of man, and that which was made good and become a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel,
ſhal once again become good, and ſo become an Angel of
light, for my ſelf ſpreading in my ſons and daughters in my cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
and peculiar ones at Jeruſalem firſt, whither I wil gather my
<hi>Sion</hi> together, and that power that ſpreads in them ſhal in time
ſpread it ſelf, and never leave ſpreading until it hath redeemed the
earth from the curſe, &amp; ſo hath redeemed man from being any more
ſubject to the ſerpent, and ſo wil never leave ſpreading its ſelf, until
it brings all into its ſelf from whence all came, and ſo ſhal all once
again return, even into the ſame condition as <hi>Adam</hi> was in; for all
to be as one, and all ſpeak one language; for as at the building of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi>
all were confounded in their languages, even ſo at the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Babel</hi> ſhal all be brought to ſpeak one language, which wil be
in revolution of all things, when the time, even that time ſhal be at
an end, then wil there be a redemption from all bondage, not ſome
only, but all, yea the whole creation ſhal then be wholly ſet free
<hi>into the glorious liberties of the ſons of God;</hi> all creatures ſhal then have
benefit by Chriſt, yea the very poor beaſts; for all things ſhal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
as they were in <hi>Adams</hi> daies before he fel, even in the year
vvhen I the Lord even I <hi>the mighty God of Iacob</hi> wil judge and deſtroy al
that enmity that hath bin betwixt the creature, and ſo all that
enmity that hath been betvvixt one Creature and another, and
all ſhal be ſet free even into liberty once again; ſo that I vvil make
all men to be changed, and vvil take avvay that malicious ſpirit that
novv is and remaines amongſt men; and I, even I vvil bring all
things round, and ſo vvil make my ſon Chriſt to be a great redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and he ſhal redeem all that did fal in <hi>Adam,</hi> from death and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery,

vvhile then, the creature man ſhal not be vvholy ſet free from the
curſe that is from ſerpentine vviſdome, and from being troubled

            <p>For darkneſs ſhal cover the earth, and groſs darkneſs the people,
this darkneſs that ſhal cover the earth vvil be by reaſon it is my

I doth this, it ſhal ſurely come to paſs, even then ſhal the poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
be in darkneſs and not able to ſee light, by reaſon of my

in and amongſt my Saints, whom all ſhal acknowledge that

my ſelf into this peculiar place for to make my ſelf glorious,
and ſo to make my name in far greater eſteem by all ſorts of
men then now it is, I wil make my light ſhine in a far more greater
and glorious manner then now it doth, for I wil be the
praiſe of the whole earth, I dwelling in my people,
and my people dwelling in me, and I will meaſure the inward
court, even my Temple, wherein all fleſh and fleſhlyneſs ſhal ceaſe
and be no more, and I alone wil appear to be King, and the only
ruler, and ſo wil cauſe my light to ſhine upon them, when darkneſs
ſhal cover the earth, which darkneſs and groſs darkneſs ſhal be by
reaſon of my not ſhining in the world; for all people ſhal be left
in darkneſs and not in light that come not up to the place of reſt;
where I wil cauſe my people for to ly down in peace, and ſo to be
at reſt, and ſo to be quiet, and be in peace.</p>

even by being caſt out and not ſuffered to enter into the

all, the divel, and hel, and all witches ſhal ceaſe then, even) in the year
7000. for that ſhal be a year of <hi>Jubilee</hi> to all ſorts of people, when
all ſorts then ſhal be brought into my love and favour, and ſhal ſo

ſhal be ever with the Lord of hoſt, and ſo ſhal dy no more, but
live for ever, and all the Saints ſhal come with I the Lord of hoſt,
even to be glorified, and ſo to receive what bodies it ſhal pleaſe I
their King to give them there; for it is true that my ſons and
daughters ſhal be brought to be glorified, and ſhal have bodies given
them, though not the ſame bodies of clay as formerly they had, even
they ſhal beraiſed up to live &amp; reign for evermore; even my Saints as
the Saints formerly were raiſed out of the graves and walked up
and down, ſo ſhal my Saints be now raiſed up to be at Ieruſalem in
glory, for the Jeruſalem is the place which I have choſen for to
make my name glorious, and the place of my Saints heaven: for
though people talk of heaven above, there is none: heaven above
is my ſelf drawing my Saints into my fulneſs, then <hi>I</hi> bring them
into my third heaven, which is my higheſt diſpenſation, and the
higheſt diſcovery of my love to them: and this heaven ſhal be
here on earth, even at Jeruſalem, and the place about Jeruſalem,
where I wil appoint my Sons and Daughters to be; and this ſhal
be their heaven they ſhal live in the ful enjoyment of I the Lord
Almighty, and they ſhal ſee all former things to be paſſed
away, and all things become new; and they ſhal live in pure
love, and in the full enjoyment, of I the Lord of hoſt, who
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:52339:35"/>
hath made them holy whom I wil alwaies cauſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce,
and ſing, and leap for joy of heart, becauſe former troubles
are paſſed away, and all are now become new, and all things ſhal
be new; <hi>for the Lord cometh with ten thouſand of his Saints, and the. Lord
will raign in mount Sion for evermore:</hi> even I the mighty God of <hi>Jacob</hi>
wil raign for ever over my people, and over my enemies, and all ſhal

            <p>But the Lord ſhal ariſe upon thee, and his glory ſhal be ſeen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thee, when nothing but darkneſs ſhal be in the earth and in the
outward court: though there be nothing elſe in the earth, but
darkneſs, ſuch darkneſs as men (earthly men) ſhal have no comfort
at all in all their outward formes and waies of worſhips; which is
the outward court, and is not to be meaſured at all, but is to be
left to be trodden under foot, as that which ſhal come to nothing,
and as a thing of no account, by Aliens and Gentils, even by ſuch
as know not me the Lord. But as for my ſons and daughters whom I
have made choice of, &amp; ſo wil bring them into <hi>Judea,</hi> there to make
my glory to be ſeen amongſt them: then ſhal they ſee that I am
riſen upon them, and ſo conſequently, they are the inward court
which is to be meaſured, and ſo to be made much of: even that new
man Chriſt the anointed that is in them, ſhal increaſe and grow ſo
ſtrong in every kind or degree, that their old man <hi>Adam</hi> ſhal be
deſtroyed and quite brought to nothing: and then in theſe (I mean
the <hi>Jews and Gentiles)</hi> which ſhal be gathered into <hi>Iudea</hi> the Land of

world, and the partakers of this great glory, ſhal be the inward

manner as never hath bin as yet, which inward court ſhal be taught
by my ſelf, and ſo ſhal have the injoyment of my ſelf, when all
fleſh, and fleſhly actings ſhal be deſtroyed and brought to nothing;
and ſo ſhal this new man which is ſpiritual be wholy freed from
the curſe, and ſhal never have the like power again for to
come under the curſe, even under that curſe which <hi>Adam</hi> brought
into or upon the world, as to dy and ſo to be ſubject to death or
dying, but ſhal be wholly freed from the curſe, and ſo ſhal be reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into the ſame condition again as <hi>Adam</hi> was in before his fal,
and ſo ſhal have no power any more to come under the curſe; but I
their God wil ſo guide them by my eternal glory, which ſhal ſhine
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:52339:35"/>
upon them, even upon the new man, which ſhal make al the old
man ceaſe from being, and ſo this new man ſhal be in a more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
manner diſcovered to be, even this new man ſhal ſpring forth as
to be altogether righteous, even the inocency and right couſneſs
that was in <hi>Adam</hi> at the firſt, when he was commanded not to eat
the forbidden fruit: which fruit was nothing elſe then that he
ſhould not ſeek to be higher then I had ſet him to be, &amp; ſo ſhould not
breake my words but fulfil them, which I knew wel enough he
would break them and not fulfil them, by his longing deſire after
the fruit which I had commanded him he ſhould not eat of, that is,
he ſhould not have any deſire to know more then I had given him,
but he ſhould have reſted himſelf in that condition which I had
placed him in, and then had not he eaten of the forbidden fruit,
and ſo had not done any thing for to diſpleaſe. It is true I was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed
with him to his apprehenſions, becauſe I did curſe the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,</hi>
which <hi>Serpent</hi> was that reaſon, knowledge and wiſdome,
which I had given him for to glorifie me, and ſo by curſing of that,
it became a divel and ſo is my greateſt enemy that now <hi>I</hi> have in
paradiſe, even in my own peculiar people, to whom I have made out
my glory moſt too, for the garden of paradiſe is man, wherein were
nothing but glory, or wherein I had made my ſelf to man to tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
even in Adam, and ſo would not have had him ſuffered at all,
or knew any ſorrow at al, had not he have bin ſo inquiſitive for
to have known more then <hi>I</hi> would let him at the firſt. And when
he had eaten of the fruit, it is ſaid he walked in the garden and
was naked: that is, knew wel enough that he had diſobeyed me,
and ſo in that ſence he was naked, as being ſtript of my glory,
and of that injoyment of me which formerly he had; even ſo that
he could not have that free commerce or enjoyment of me as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
he had, as to talk with me; and he being naked, and had
covered himſelf with ſigg leaves, that he had ſowed together; was
nothing but his own righteouſneſs; by which he would fain have
hid his fault from me, and ſo would have made <hi>Eve</hi> have lain in
all the fault: and ſo ever ſince man being driven out of the garden
as <hi>Adam</hi> was; which was from the ful and perfect enjoyment of
I their Lord: and ſo from having no more ſweet and pleaſant
mirth with me, as <hi>Adam</hi> had at the firſt; have bin inventing and
ſowing ſigg leaves together, that is, they have bin juſtifying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in their waies, and ſo wil not be ready to confeſs their faults,
but to lay it to another, as <hi>Adam</hi> did his: and Adam being put out
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:52339:36"/>
of the garden, there was ſet a flaming ſword that turneth every
way, for to keep <hi>Adam</hi> from the tree of life, that ſo poor <hi>Adam</hi>
might not eat again and live for ever: for this flaming ſword that
did turn every way, was my power, my infinite power, for to
keep <hi>Adam</hi> from the ful enjoyment of me, and ſo from the Tree of
life: for I had withdrawn my ſelf, even my power from <hi>Adam,</hi> and
ſo would not let him have that power again, but would keep him
from the Tree of life; even from the pure enjoyment of me, and
ſo from life which I had promiſed him, that he ſhould have lived
for ever: which priviledge he loſt by diſobedience, and by falling
from me, and ſo hath never ſince obtained the ſame priviledge;
but all have lain under the curſe for to dy: which priviledge I the
reſtoring power wil now reſtore to my Saints firſt, even to thoſe
whom I wil carry out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> both out of myſtical <hi>Babylon,</hi> which
is the very myſtery of iniqity: and out of literal <hi>Babylon,</hi> by my
ſtrong hand into <hi>Judea,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> the place where I wil
make my ſelf more glorious then as yet ſince the fal of <hi>Adam;</hi> and
ſo wil reſtore to my Saints there, that priviledge as <hi>Adam</hi> loſt and
hath not as yet bin obtained, but now ſhal be obtained, which
priviledge ſhal be a ful and perfect enjoyment of I the creator of
all creatures, and ſo to be freed from the curſe which is from
ſelf, reaſon, knowledge, and wiſdome, that is, they
ſhall no longer have that reaſon, knowledge, and wiſdome,
which I did give to every <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo to every man going beyond
the bounds, but they ſhal by my power ſtand in the ful enjoyment
of me, as <hi>Adam</hi> did at the firſt; and ſo they ſhal never have power
any more (as <hi>Adam</hi> had) for to fal from the pure and perfect en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of I their Creator, as <hi>Adam</hi> did; but ſhal be reſtored in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the ſame condition as <hi>Adam</hi> was at the firſt, even into that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
as for to live for ever, even to all eternity, and ſo never to
dy any more, as <hi>Adam</hi> did by his fal, but ſhal be wholy freed from
the curſe; as from all kind of ſickneſſes and ſorrows which came
into the world by reaſon of the curſe which I pronounced againſt
<hi>Adam</hi> for breaking of my revealed wil: which condition they being
reſtored into, there cannot chuſe but be abundance of joy, which
joy wil light upon my choſen ones, whom I wil gather to Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,
and joy and gladneſs ſhal be there: even to my Sion that ſhal

who wil make you to ſhine moſt illubriouſly and gloriouſly; even
ſo bright, that the Gentiles, even my choſen ones (whom I have made

Now ſhal ye gather your ſelves together, and rejoyce, and be glad
becauſe of thoſe that are converted, for to come up to thee, O Sion,
who hath bin made a laughing ſtock in all Nations, but now ſhal
be made the praiſe of all Nations, and that all ſhal come up to thee
that wil have any reſt, or be ſatisfied with my fulneſs, even thoſe
that have bin your great enemies ſhal now be glad to come to thee
O Sion, which ſhal be gathered to Ieruſalem, with their gold and

thee, who have choſen thee to be the glory of all Nations, look

even theſe be my ſons and daughters, who are Gentiles, and
want reſt, and ſeek for reſt, but can find none, therefore hearing of
my glory wherewith I make out my ſelf to thee, O Sion: in whom
I am in the midſt of thee, they fly as clouds, they haſten from their
Countries, even to come to thee: that ſo they may have reſt and
peace with thee O Sion, in whom I the holy one of Iſrael is in the

            <p>Surely the Iſles ſhal wait for me, and the ſhips of Tarſhiſh, for
to bring thy ſons from far, their ſilver and their gold with them,
unto the name of the Lord thy God; and to the holy one of
Iſrael, becauſe he hath glorified thee, even theſe Ilands, as Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land

who have a long time bin caſt off, but now through my mighty
power, will graft them into the true vine again: and they ſhal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
glorious, and ſhal ſay, bleſſed be they that come in the name of
the Lord, Hoſanna in the higheſt, though formerly through unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe
and <hi>hardneſs of heart they crucified my ſon Ieſus,</hi> and ſo would not
have him to be their King, becauſe he did not come in pomp and
glory, but came of a Carpenters wife, and deſcended from ſo low a
linage: ſhal we (ſay they) believe this man is the ſon of God, ſeeing
that he is ſo poor and ſo mean, and ſeeing he came for to deſtroy our
Laws, and formes of worſhips and governments, and the old cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes
of offering up ſacrifice, which was that law and Teſtament
that God gave unto <hi>Moſes</hi> for us to obſerve and keep for ever? there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
before they would part from their formes of worships, and
ſo would have a new one: they would crucifie my ſon Ieſus, and
would not then have him to be their King, for which cauſe I did
caſt them off, and ſo did cauſe them to be diſperſed in all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>But now I have in my mercy and pitty towards them, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred

the covenant which I made to their father <hi>Abraham,</hi> that in him
all nations ſhal be bleſſed and ſo wil now reſtore them by my pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
from their enemies in what country or nation they be diſperſed,
and wil make them to be gathered together into their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
and now I wil give them hearts to believe in me, and ſo wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly

firſt, and how the God of <hi>Iacob</hi> wil appear to be their God, and ſo

known to ſome Engliſh men for to bring them word, even the
<hi>Iews</hi> that are diſperſed about in Holland, and Spaine Germany and
Italy; and how it is the pleaſure of I the Lord of hoſt, for to put
my ſpirit of courage and valiantneſs for to make you that are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed
in theſe countries, as Holland, France, Spaine, Germany, &amp; Italy,
gather your ſelves together, and ſo to meet all of you, and theſe
whom I ſhal ſend out of <hi>England</hi> to you, for to meet in the
year fifty (one now a coming on) in Italy, and I wil be your rock and

even for to make you the praiſe of the whole earth; and I wil ſtir up
armies that ſhal fight for you, ſo that I wil bring you ſafely into

it is my pleaſure to bring down the high and mighty one, and ſo
to lay him low, even wil I not favour any, but wil bring them all
down to the ground, yea I wil bring down that potent enemie that
doth ſo highly exalt himſelf, and he ſhal come to nothing, even

whom I wil bring to Ieruſalem; and becauſe it is my pleaſure that it
ſhould be ſo, <hi>I</hi> even I the Lord of hoſt wil appear for to confound my

even that proud Turk that rules and domineers now, ſhal be before the

his life in the year 1656 and ſo there shal never after him, nor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

that things preſent, and have bin by cuſtome of long ſtanding, turned
upſides once again, that I may make Ieruſalem <hi>the praiſe of the whole
earth;</hi> whoſe gates shal be continually open, and shal not be shut day
or night, that men may bring unto them, even unto the new Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,
the forces of the Gentiles, even ſuch abundance there ſhal be
that shal be brought in for to be your fellows and brethren, one and
of the ſame Citty, that the places which I formerly gave unto your
Fathers for their inheritances, ſhal be enlarged, and ſtrangers shal
build your Citty, even the wals of your Cities; even ſuch ſhal build
them up for you, that ſhal not inhabite there; and Kings ſhal mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter

have no need of any; yet it is my pleaſure ſo much to magnifie you,
that I wil make my ſelf appear to be glorious in you, even in the midſt
of you: and wil make people ſay of a truth, <hi>that God is in you;</hi> and ſo
to acknowledge that <hi>you are the ſeed which the Lord hath bleſſed,</hi> and ſo to
make them ſee and know, that I the Lord of hoſt am in you, even in
you all, ruling in you, and making all your enemies become ſubject
to you. But I muſt tel you, that I wil not appear perſonally for to
raign over you, and ſo to give you laws to walk by, no, but I wil
raign in you, and I the God of truth wil be in you, and I wil teach
you how you ſhal walk, by putting my laws in your inward parts,
and in writing of them in your hearts, and ſo wil ſpeake in you, and
wil alſo make you for to worſhip me in ſpirit and in truth, &amp; not in
outward formes as now you do: for the glory of <hi>Lebanon</hi> ſhal come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thee, and the Box tree, and the Fir tree ſhal come together, to beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
the place of my Sanctuary, and ſo to make my feet glorious;
ſuch is the worke of I the Lord of hoſt, that I wil make the very glory
of the world be brought to <hi>Sion,</hi> even for to make them glorious;
and I wil make the place of thy feet glorious, ö Sion, and all the ſons

of them, the feet that afflicted thee, ſhal come bowing and bending
to the ſoles of thy feet; and ſhal cal thee the Sion, the Citty of the

Sion, that I wil make thee have power over al thy enemies, and none
ſhal be able for to oppoſe thee: but all ſhal be brought to nothing
and confounded; yea even they ſhal be in ſuch terror and fear now,
that they ſhal ſubmit themſelves to thee, and cal thee, even thee O
Sion, whom I wil gather to Jeruſalem, the Citty of the Lord, even
of I the Lord of hoſt. And whereas thou haſt bin forſaken, ſo that
no man went through thee; even thee O Ieruſalem, that hath been
laid waſt; I wil now of a ſudden make thee an eternal excellency, a
joy of many generations, even I wil make thee to be ſo glorious, that
thou ſhalt be the glory and joy of Nations; for thou ſhalt be freed
from ſorrow and trouble, and vexation of ſpirit, and ſhal live in
peace, and be at peace, rejoicing in I the Lord of hoſt; when others
ſhal be troubled and vexed, to think that they do not partake of the
ſame glory wherewith I have and wil glorifie thee; and thou shalt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
ſuck the milke of the Gentiles; even that joy and comfort which
formerly they had of me, when I did make out my ſelf to them in
formes of worſhips; which joy and comfort you ſhal now have, and
thou ſhal know that I the Lord am thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the
mighty God of <hi>Jacob:</hi> for braſs thou shalt have gold; and for Iron, ſilver;
inſtead of outward forms, thou shalt have the pure injoyment of I the
Lord of hoſt in ſpirit: and I wil make ſuch a worke amongſt you
now, that inſtead of giving oppreſſours to be your officers, I wil give
you ſuch that shal be peace-makers; and I wil make your officers or
exacters over you now, to be righteous; nay there shal be none any
longer for to be officers one over another; but you shal be all alike:
for as the maſter is, ſo shal be the man; as the miſtriſs, ſo ſhal be the
maid; as the buyer, ſo shal be the ſeller; even all alike, and none
greater then other, but what one hath, ſhal be the others: for I wil
now make all things new; for <hi>violence ſhal be no more heard with in thy
borders, but thou ſhall call thy walls ſalvation, and thy gates praiſe:</hi> even thou
(ö Sion) that ſhal be gathered together in <hi>Iudea</hi> (and in thoſe places
thereabouts) which by reaſon of the greatneſs of thy company, I
wil enlarge thy borders; for I the Lord of hoſt wil be your wals and
your gates, and wil be ſalvation to you, for to keep and preſerve you
from all your enemies.</p>
            <p>The Sun shal no more be thy light by day, neither for brightneſs shal
the Moon give light to thee, but the Lord ſhal be unto thee an everlaſting

light, &amp; thy God thy glory; the ſun shal no more go down, neither shal
the Moon withdraw her ſelf, for the Lord shal be even I the Lord of the
everlaſting light, and I thy God thy glory; and the daies of thy mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
sha be ended. Whereas thou haſt bin ſorrowing up and down
and haſt I gone out of one country into the other, mourning and
weeping, and ſo haſt found no comfort: now theſe shal all paſs from
thee, and thou shalt weep no more: ö Sion, for the Lord hath founded
thee ö Sion, and wil be your King for ever, even your light, life, joy,
and glory, <hi>even your All and all:</hi> ſo that thou shal not have need of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ordinances, either one or the other: but I wil be a Sun and a
Moon for to give thee light, and for to make thee ſee: though it hath
a long time been neither light nor dark, neither day nor night, but
now in the evening there shal be light: even in theſe laſt days, light
shal now shine in ſuch a perfect and clear manner, that it ſhal be
known to be light, for I the Lord of hoſt wil be ſun-light, and moon-light,
and wil be day, and ſo indeed it wil be very glorious, when I
the Lord of hoſt wil never leave them, nor forſake them; but wil be
alwaies with them: even never withdrawing light from them, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
making it for to encreaſe and grow, and multiply it ſelf: til
it comes to be ſeven fold more light then formerly there hath bin: and
until the weakeſt and feebleſt that are among you be as <hi>David. and David
as the Angel of God, even as God,</hi> this ſhal be the eſtate and condition of
you, ö Sion: whom I wil gather together to Ieruſalem, and ſo wil
make you the praiſe of the whole earth, even the very weakeſt of or
among you ſhal know as much, and have as much knowledge as <hi>David</hi>
had, and ſhal be in as great favour as <hi>David</hi> was with <hi>I</hi> the Lord of hoſt,
who hath commanded the writer hereof to write it as my wil, and not
as his wil, becauſe I have purpoſed to appear ſo bright and in ſuch a
glorious manner to them, making them partakers of my glory, that
they ſhal have as much knowledge as <hi>David,</hi> and they ſhal be even as,
Angels of God, yea even Angels, and ſhal know as much of God even
of I the Lord of hoſt, that they ſhal all be taught of I their God, and
ſhal have no need of teachers to teach them, for I wil be their teacher
and inſtructer, and ſo wil guide them in the way of truth, and from it
they ſhal not err, neither ſhal ſlip aſide as now they do, but they ſhal
al of them be kept upright by my power, and I wil not let them ſlip
aſide from me; but wil uphold them with my right hand, &amp; wil carry
them in my boſom, and ſo wil make them to reſt in me as their only
joy, even in I the Lord of hoſt; thy people alſo ſhal al be righteous, they
ſhal inherite the Land for ever, the branch of my planting, the workes
