         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>As the <hi>Oratour</hi> grown old, wrote of old age to an old man; and of
friendship, to his much indeared friend: so is this Discourse of
Riches and Happinesse, writ to such, and such only; as would be Happy
as well as Rich.</p>
            <p>Not to all, nor to all that are Rich: as well knowing, that the way to
please the best, is to displease the <hi>most:</hi> and that to frame or fashion my

            </p>
            <p>Again, Some and not a few, are like the <hi>Gadarens,</hi> (Mark. 5. 17.) who

Nor is it amisse, to leave such as these to themselves: untill <hi>time</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,</hi>

as having still found, when I have finished what I intended; their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment

            <head>How to become Rich and Happy, The Second Part.</head>
            <head>CHAP. I.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He <hi>Chirurgeons</hi> of <hi>Greece,</hi> (like our <hi>English Mountebanks</hi>)
were wont to shew the operations of their Skill upon Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folds,
in view of all passengers: thereby to assure men what
they could do, as well as to get more practice and custom,
if they were deserving. The <hi>Merchant</hi> thinks it a good course, first
to try with a little, how vendible his <hi>commodity</hi> will be, and after he
replenisheth the <hi>Market,</hi> according to the esteem it findes with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants.
Nor is he held wise, that will venter all his estate in one
bottom. Such were my thoughts, in publishing the first part of this
Tracte: intending (like <hi>Phïdias</hi> touching his <hi>portrayture</hi>) that if it
were liked, did abide the <hi>touch,</hi> passe the <hi>standard</hi> of the judicious
Readers approbation: I would publish the residue, otherwise not:
res<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lving whether allowed of, they should <hi>incourage me;</hi> or disliked,
they should <hi>amend me.</hi> And now having found that acceptance,
which in modesty I could not expect, I have sent abroad the second
Part.</p>
            <p>In the former Part of this Discourse, I have declared <hi>what it is,</hi> and
<hi>what it is not</hi> to be Rich: and withall chalked out the way in six
Particulars, how men that are poor, may become Rich, and rid of
poverty. In this which follows, I shall declare how they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<hi>Happy,</hi> and rid of discontent or <hi>Melancholy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now for the effecting of this, there needs no more be done, than
to cure men of their covetousnesse: for if that be once done, all is
done; otherwise nothing, or nothing to purpose. For let a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
man become never so rich, he is never the happier; his <hi>care,</hi>
               <hi>misery,</hi> and <hi>melancholy</hi> still remaines: but let his <hi>covetousnesse</hi> cease, and
then comes <hi>peace,</hi> and <hi>joy,</hi> and <hi>content,</hi> have he never so little: as I
shall shew when I come unto it. Yea, let men but leave, or be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to leave this one sinne, and they shall depart from this discourse,
(like <hi>Naaman</hi> out of <hi>Jordan</hi>) as if they had been washt, and all their
sinnes taken away, like the <hi>scales</hi> from <hi>Pauls eyes,</hi> Act. 9. 18. For
what hath brought <hi>Vsury,</hi> and <hi>Simony,</hi> and <hi>non-residency,</hi> and <hi>bribery,</hi>
and <hi>perjury,</hi> and <hi>felony,</hi> and <hi>cruelty,</hi> and <hi>hypocrisie,</hi> and <hi>subtilty,</hi> and <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,</hi>
and <hi>strife,</hi> and <hi>debate</hi> into the <hi>City,</hi> and <hi>Nation,</hi> and made every
<hi>house</hi> an <hi>Inne,</hi> and every <hi>shopa Market</hi> of <hi>oathes,</hi> and <hi>lyes,</hi> and <hi>equivocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
and <hi>fraude,</hi> and indeed of what not? but the superfluous and
excessive love of money? What is the cause of all the <hi>murmurings,
mutinies, jarres, contentions, grudgings, repinings, fretting, chafing,
weeping, vexing, complaining,</hi> and <hi>discontent</hi> in every Family? but <hi>the
great controversie</hi> of <hi>mine and thine.</hi> Name but covetousnesse, and you
have named the Mother of all sinnes that can be named, which makes
the <hi>Apostle</hi> call it, <hi>The root of all evil,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 10. Wherefore my
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56896:3"/>
principal endeavour shall be, to prescribe some remedyes against this
cursed sinne. O that I could with little <hi>David,</hi> cull out of the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
(that spiritual and celestial <hi>Brook</hi>) the <hi>stone</hi> or <hi>Pible,</hi> that
would kill this <hi>Goliah:</hi> then would I stick it into his temples, with all
my might. For I thirst to pleasure these unworthy men, with that
which is more worth beyond compare, than all their wealth multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as many times, as there are lands on the sea-shore. For let me
tell you, <hi>you worshippers of the golden Calf:</hi> that the <hi>cure</hi> which <hi>Erasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratus</hi>
did upon <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tiochus,</hi> for which he had fourteen thousand
three hundred and seventy five pounds; was nothing to this cure of
covetousnesse, in him that is therewith infected, or thereto inslaved:
as you will confesse if you but consider, what the difficulty of this
cure is, of which I have largely spoken in <hi>Chapter 19,</hi> to <hi>Chapter 23.</hi>
of the fore-going part.</p>

            <p>Now there is no way to remove this let, or to rescue them from this
<hi>Remora:</hi> except I can insure them, that they shall be gainers by the
bargain, and receive by way of exchange, that which shall more than
countervail what they part withall: which I doubt not, by the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing

this desperate evil: and therein shew them, how they shall or may,
of the most miserable men alive, become the most Blessed and Happy.
And who knows whether <hi>God</hi> hath nor put me upon this work, and
will accordingly blesse the meanes that shall be used? though by a
most unworthy and insufficient Instrument? Neither is the strength
or weaknesse of meanes, either spur or bridle to <hi>Gods</hi> choice, who
sometimes does <hi>greatest acts, by weakest Agents;</hi> and gives the <hi>greater

<hi>God</hi> shall speak to your <hi>hearts</hi> by his <hi>spirit,</hi> touching your <hi>temporal,
civil, spiritual,</hi> and <hi>eternal</hi> state.</p>
            <p>Now if you would relinquish this sinne, and so be everlastingly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py;

            <p>
               <hi>God</hi> comes and out-bids the <hi>world;</hi> for he offers <hi>grace,</hi> and <hi>peace,</hi>

he makes it worse: for the incouragement that <hi>Christ</hi> gives is, <hi>Whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
will be my Disciple, let him take up his cross daily and follow me,</hi>
Luk. 9. 23. Yea more than that, in case a man hath got any part of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56896:4"/>
what he injoyes unjustly; he must restore the same to the right own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
though it be to the impoverishiing of his estate. As in case thou
wouldst indeed, and to purpose become <hi>rich, happy</hi> and <hi>cheerfull;</hi>
If thou lovest not gold, above thy salvation: restore to every man thy
evil-gotten goods. For as <hi>humility</hi> is the <hi>repentance</hi> of <hi>pride, abstinence</hi>
of <hi>surfeit, almes</hi> of <hi>covetousnesse, love</hi> of <hi>malice:</hi> so only <hi>restitution,</hi> is
the repentance of <hi>injustice.</hi> This is the revenge that a <hi>Christian</hi> must
take upon himself, if he meanes to be saved, <hi>2 Cor. 7. 11.</hi> For as the

have <hi>meat</hi> in their <hi>stomachs undigested,</hi> or store of <hi>ill humours,</hi> are eased
only by <hi>vometing</hi> them up: so if ever thou lookest to find ease in thy
soul, and conscience, or to pacifie <hi>God;</hi> be sure to vomit up all thy
extortions, by restitution. For as it fared with those <hi>Marriners</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Jonas, Jonah 1. 15.</hi> they <hi>tremble, pray, unlade, strike sayles,</hi> fall to

            <p>There are a world of men, that <hi>bear the Name,</hi> and <hi>wear the livery,</hi>
but have not the <hi>soules</hi> of <hi>Christians.</hi> Others must pay them, or they
will use all kindes of extremity: but they (by their good wills)
will not pay what is lent them, in their greatest need. But a <hi>debtor</hi>
that <hi>can pay,</hi> and <hi>will not,</hi> makes himself <hi>uncapable of pardon.</hi> Indeed
such men think to set all on <hi>Christs score,</hi> and to say <hi>Dimitte mobis de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bita

the other part of the petition. But <hi>God</hi> does not forgive <hi>spiritual debts</hi>
where men have no care to pay <hi>temporal debts.</hi> For he that dies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
restitution, dies in his sinne: and he that dies in his sinne, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be saved. Nor is there a more infallible <hi>character of a wicked man,</hi>

               <hi>Augustin</hi> speaks, and all <hi>Orthodox Divines</hi> hold; in case the party

is as if a <hi>thief</hi> should take away thy <hi>purse,</hi> ask thee <hi>pardon,</hi> say
he is <hi>sorry</hi> for it; but <hi>keeps it still:</hi> In this case, wouldst thou not say he

hast taken from thy <hi>neighbour</hi> or <hi>master;</hi> with a <hi>fifth part</hi> (for amends)
added to the principal, <hi>Levit. 6. 5. Numb. 5. 6, 7, 8.</hi> And we read that

            <p>Nor had <hi>Zacheus</hi> his repentance served his turn, (if ever he had

mistakes the greatest folly, for the greatest wisdome. For while he
cozens other men of their estates; <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Satan</hi> cozens him of his soul.
See <hi>Job. 20. 15. 1 Tim. 6. 8, 10.</hi> And wofull gain it is, that comes with the

            </p>
            <p>Nor are there any such fools, as these crafty knaves: For as <hi>Austin</hi>
speaks; If the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> term <hi>that rich Churl in the Gospel a fool,</hi> that
only <hi>laid up his</hi> own <hi>Goods,</hi> Luk. 12. 18, 20. find out a name for him that
takes away other mens.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And this know, that if thou dost not</hi> (willingly, <hi>or at least with</hi>
an unwilling willingnesse) <hi>do it thy self, yet it shall be plucked from
thee with a vengeance. As what saith the</hi> Holy Ghost? <hi>Job. 20.</hi> Though
wickednesse be sweet in his mouth, though he hide it under his tongue, yet
his meat in his bowels, is turned; it is the gall of Aspes within him: he
shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly. He shall
suck the poyson of Aspes, and the Vipers tongue shall flay him: because he
hath oppressed, and forsaken the poor, because he hath violently taken away
an house, which he builded not. Surely he shall feel no quietness in his
belly. When he is about to fill his belly, God shall cast the fury of his wrath
upon him, and shall rain it upon him, while he is eating. He shall flee
from the Iron weapon, and the bow of steel shall strike him through. <hi>And
the like from</hi> vers. 5. <hi>to the end of the</hi> Chapter. <hi>And so</hi> Jeremy 17.
He that getteth riches, and not by right: shall leave them in the midst of
his daies, and at his end shall be a fool, <hi>vers. 11.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore in any case, omit not to restore what thou hast unjustly
gotten: And that without disputing the point, or making thy <hi>lust of
counsel:</hi> (as they that desire with heed, and more surely to see, do
<hi>shut the one eye.</hi>) Do like <hi>Abraham,</hi> who when he was bid to <hi>offer
his Sonne; rose up betime,</hi> and left his <hi>wife</hi> at home, never making
<hi>Sarah</hi> privy to it: lest she should stop him, <hi>Gen. 22. 6.</hi> So do it if it
be possible, before thy flesh hears of it: like <hi>Abigal,</hi> who if she
had consulted with <hi>Naball,</hi> whether she should have supplied <hi>David</hi>
with victuals or no: <hi>the Miser</hi> would never have consented: so she
had perished, with her whole family, <hi>1 Sam. 25. Paul consulted not with
flesh and blood,</hi> when he went to <hi>preach</hi> among the <hi>Heathen,</hi> Gal. 1. 16.
the case was clear enough, having a strict command from <hi>God.</hi> So
in this case, there needs no deliberation, but answer the <hi>Devil,</hi> as
that <hi>Martyr</hi> answered his <hi>Persecutors,</hi> when they offered him both
<hi>torments</hi> and <hi>rewards:</hi> (rewardes if he would deny <hi>Christ,</hi> torments
if he would not,) but withall time of deliberation: whose answer
was, <hi>In re tam iusta, nulla consultatio:</hi> The case is so clear, that I need
not study about it.</p>
            <p>Here I might shew you, both from the Word, and a world of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,

that restoring and giving rather than sinning, is the way to

            </p>
            <p>Now if covetousnesse be once cashiered by Regeneration: have
a man much or little, he will not be overmuch troubled at it.</p>
            <p>The godly man hath sufficient, though he have no wealth: even as
man in innocency was warm, and comely, though without cloathing.
<hi>A small thing vnto the just man, is better than great riches to the wicked
and mighty,</hi> Psal. 37. 16. The reason is, the one hath his sight to see
clearly his happinesse, in having what is best for him, and is content
to be poor in outward things, because his wealth and purchase, is
all inward. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he other by a just judgment of God, is so blind, that
he cannot see when he is well; but thirsts so after other mens goods,
that he takes no pleasure in his own. His heart is glewed to the
world, or rather to his wealth: and an object too near the eye, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be seen: yea be it but the breadth of a penny, it will hide from
the sight, the whole half heaven at once. Covetousnesse is like the
<hi>Albugo,</hi> or white spot <hi>in the eye:</hi> that dimmes their understandings,
and makes fools even of <hi>Achitophels,</hi> leaving them never an eye to see
withall, according to that of <hi>Moses, A gift blindeth the eyes,</hi> Exod. 23. 8.
And this for certain, could the <hi>covetous chur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi> but see, what <hi>peace,</hi> and
<hi>rest,</hi> and <hi>joy</hi> through contentation the godly man hath, at the same
time when he can say with <hi>Peter, Silver and gold have I none:</hi> he
would be also a <hi>suter</hi> to godlinesse, that he might have the <hi>dowry</hi> of
contentation. He would soon see, that it is much better to be poor
than evil, that it is quieter sleeping with <hi>a good conscience,</hi> than in a
<hi>whole skin:</hi> and that there is no comparison, between <hi>want</hi> with <hi>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,</hi>
and <hi>wealth</hi> with <hi>dishonesty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As what canst thou say against it? thou hast abundance of all things,
yet thou findest small <hi>peace, joy,</hi> or <hi>content</hi> in the world. Get but
godlinesse, and thou shalt have true content of mind, great peace of
conscience, together with joy in the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> and Gods blessing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all thou hast, or takest in hand: be thy condition in the world ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so mean.</p>
            <p>Thou hast hetherto like <hi>Satan, compassed the</hi> whole <hi>earth;</hi> never
thought of compassing <hi>Heaven:</hi> thou art as <hi>poar in grace</hi> and parts, as
<hi>rich in revennes.</hi> Thy desires about this world, have been insatiable;
but for heavenly things, a small scantling hath been thought enough.
<hi>I believe that Christ dyed for me, I am sorry for my sinnes, I hope to be
saved:</hi> this is sufficient, though thou dost all thy devotions more out
<hi>of custom,</hi> than <hi>of conscience:</hi> as <hi>Simonides</hi> reports of <hi>Theodoricus.</hi>
But wilt thou prove thy self <hi>wise?</hi> wilt thou do thy self <hi>good</hi> indeed?
the only way is to become <hi>godly.</hi> For <hi>godlinesse in great gain, if a man
be content with that he hath,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 5. And this I may be bold to
affirm, that if thou canst not say as <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>I have learned to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
godlinesse</hi> is not as yet come unto thine house. For the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56896:6"/>
of godlinesse, is contentation: which when she comes will bring
you all things. Therefore as <hi>Christ</hi> saith, <hi>If the Sonne make you free:
you shall be free indeed,</hi> John 8. 36. So I say, if godlinesse make you
rich: you shall be rich indeed. Otherwise, have you never so much,
it will no more satisfie your desire, or quench your lust: than <hi>fewel</hi>
does the <hi>flame.</hi> Yea as <hi>oyl kindleth the fire,</hi> which it <hi>seems to quench:</hi>
so riches come as though they would make a man contented, but they
make him more covetous.</p>

            <p>As see how insatiable mens desires are, of these transitory things
by some examples. Give <hi>Alexander Kingdom</hi> after <hi>Kingdom,</hi> he will
not rest till he have all. Yea giving credit to that opinion of <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critus,</hi>
to wit, that there were worlds infinite, and innumerable: he
even wept to think, that he was <hi>Emperour</hi> but of one only. And <hi>Croe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi>
the richest <hi>Prince</hi> that ever the world could boast of; thought he
had not enough. <hi>Nemo miser, nisi comparatus.</hi> And <hi>Licinius</hi> being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenished,
with almost infinite summes of gold and silver, was so far
from being satisfied, that he even sighed for, and bewailed his pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
<hi>Marcus Crassus</hi> a private <hi>Romane,</hi> worth eight hundred fifty and
two thousands pounds; yet never thought himself rich enough; but
was still as greedy, and griping as ever. <hi>Ahab</hi> hath a whole <hi>Kingdom,</hi>
yet because he cannot have poor <hi>Nahotb's vineyard, he goes into his
house heavy and in displeasure, lyes turning upon his bed,</hi> and cannot
so much as eat his meat: all he hath will do him no good, 1 <hi>Kings</hi>
21. 3, 4.</p>
            <p>And the like might be shewn of all other outward comforts:
For suppose a man should have all he could wish, or desire, (as it is
feigned of <hi>Apollonius,</hi> that he never asked any things of the <hi>gods</hi> in all
his life, but it was granted him:) <hi>health, wealth, honours, pleasures,</hi>
and the like: yet when he had enjoyed them but one whole day, he
would not be contented, something he would still want, one thing
or other would displease him; untill <hi>God</hi> comes; and then he saith
with holy <hi>David, My cup is full, the lynes are fallen unto me in pleasant
places, I have a goodly heritage,</hi> Psalm. 16. 6. &amp; 23. 5. As the worldling
is not satisfied with sinne, so he is satisfied with nothing. <hi>Riches</hi>
come, and yet the man is not pleased; <hi>Honours</hi> come, as an addition
to wealth, and yet the man is not pleased: as it fared with <hi>Haman,</hi>
who having reckoned up all the <hi>glory, promotions, riches, banquets,
graces and favours of the King and Queen, respect of the Nobles, &amp;c.</hi> yet he
concludes that all is <hi>nothing, so long as Mordechai sits in the Kings gate.</hi>
He had the homage of all knees but one, and was ready to burst for
lack of that; he is miserably vexed, that all other men, did not think
him so good, and great as he thinks himself.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>Pleasures</hi> come, and yet the man is not pleased: The <hi>lusts
of the flesh</hi> are fulfilled by him, and yet he is not pleased: <hi>Liberty, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
peace,</hi> and the like, they all come, and yet the man is not pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
untill <hi>Christ</hi> comes, as he did to <hi>Zacheus:</hi> and then he hath
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56896:7"/>
more than enough, or then he desires, and therefore imparts, a great
part of what he hath, unto others that have lesse.</p>

            <head>CHAP. VI</head>
            <p>But to apply this to the present occasion. I would fain know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this be not thy case, that art an unmercifull rich man? Hast thou
not all outward comforts, presenting themselves and their service to
thee in great aboundance? Yet they are to thee, and in thy account
but <hi>miserable comforters.</hi> For though thy <hi>house</hi> be <hi>full,</hi> and thy <hi>shop
full,</hi> and thy <hi>coffers full,</hi> and thy <hi>purse full,</hi> and thy <hi>passures full,</hi> yet
thy <hi>heart</hi> is still <hi>lanke</hi> and <hi>empty,</hi> through an excessive desire of more:
as if thy heart were without a bottom. Whereas, if thou wouldst
but admit <hi>Christ</hi> into thy heart, (who now <hi>stan is at the door and
knocks,</hi> Revel. 3. 20.) thou wouldst then need no more, who now
needest every thing: (even what thou hast in possession.) For he
alone that fills <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>earth,</hi> can fill the <hi>soul.</hi> Nothing but the
<hi>Trinity of Persons</hi> in that one <hi>Deity;</hi> can fill the <hi>triangular concave of
mans heart. Shew us the Father</hi> (saith <hi>Philip) and it sufficeth,</hi> John
14. 8. Nay shew us but thy truth, (whereby <hi>Satan</hi> and our deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
hearts may not so deceive us,) and it sufficeth, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 13.
When godlinesse comes, content follows it. What saies <hi>Christ?
Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness; for they shall be
satisfied.</hi> Not they that hunger and thirst after <hi>riches,</hi> nor they that
hunger and thirst after <hi>honour,</hi> nor they that hunger and thirst after
<hi>pleasure,</hi> but they that hunger and thirst after <hi>righteousness:</hi> They shall
be satisfied, and satisfied to the full, <hi>Mat. 5. 6, &amp;c.</hi> Thus it fared with
<hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Paul,</hi> who was able to say after his conversion, that which he nor
any else could ever say before conversion, <hi>I have learnt in whatsoever
state<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I am, therewith to be content.</hi> First he learnt godlinesse, then
godlinesse taught him contentation; and is there any satisfaction like
content? When <hi>Christ</hi> brought salvation to <hi>Zacheus,</hi> his minde was
strangely altered: before he was all for getting, now he is all for
giving. This was not the first day that he seemed <hi>rich to others,</hi> but
this was the first day he seemed <hi>rich to himself.</hi> Riches bring conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Godlinesse brings contentation. Gain hath often hurt the get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
piety and Godlinesse is profitable to all men, and for all things:
I <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. Godlinesse is the most profitable thing in the world,
because it maketh all things else profitable; And it is for want of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Godlinesse, that the covetous mans riches no whit profit him.
Godlinesse setteth such a glass before the eyes of them, that possesse
the same: that it will make a <hi>shilling</hi> seem as great as a <hi>pound,</hi> a <hi>Cottage</hi>
thought as sumptuons as a <hi>Palace,</hi> a <hi>Plow</hi> seem as goodly as a <hi>Scepter;</hi>
so that he which hath but <hi>twenty pounds,</hi> shall be as merry as he who

6. 6. And well it may, for it gains <hi>God,</hi> and with him his blessing
upon all things else. He saith also, That <hi>bodily exercise profiteth little,
but godliness is profitable for all things,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 8. But shall I shew

            <p>The particular Benefits and Priviledges of Grace and Godlinesse, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all worldly commodities, are innumerable; I'le name only Nine,
that you may the better remember them. There is nothing wherein
men usually rejoyce, but the godly more than find it in <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, Does any man desire or glory in <hi>Knowledge? In him are hid all
the treasures of wisdome and knowledge,</hi> Col. 2. 3. <hi>I desire to know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
among you, but Jesus Christ, and him crucified,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 2. <hi>This is
eternal life, to know thee the only God, and whom thou hast sent, Jesus
Christ,</hi> John 17. 3.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Does any man desire, or glory in <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Nobility?</hi>
Believers are more Noble than any other men, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 11. <hi>The righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
is more worthy than his neigbour,</hi> Prov. 12. 26. &amp; 28. 6. The best No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
is the <hi>Nobility of Faith,</hi> and the best genealogie, <hi>the genealogie
of good works.</hi> The only true greatnesse, is to be <hi>great in the sight of
the Lord,</hi> as <hi>John Baptist</hi> was, Luk. 1. 15. Whence it is, that <hi>David</hi>
thought it not so happy for him, to be a <hi>King in his own house,</hi> as a
door-keeper in <hi>Gods house.</hi> That <hi>Solomon</hi> preferred the title of <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastes,</hi>
before the title of the <hi>King of Jerusalem.</hi> That <hi>Theodosius</hi>
the <hi>Emperour,</hi> preferred the title of <hi>Membrum Ecclesiae:</hi> before that
of <hi>Caput Imperii:</hi> professing that he had rather be <hi>a Saint and no
King,</hi> than a <hi>King and no Saint.</hi> And that <hi>godly Constantine</hi> rejoyced
more, in being the <hi>Servant of Christ:</hi> than in being <hi>Emperour of the
whole world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed, <hi>Gods</hi> servants, are the only <hi>worthies</hi> of the world:
for <hi>Christ</hi> hath made them spiritual <hi>Kings,</hi> Rev. 1. 6. So happy are
they, as to have this high honour and dignity given them. Yea so soon
as regenerate, we are made <hi>Sons to a King,</hi> 2 Cor. 6. 18. <hi>Brothers to a
King,</hi> Heb. 2. 11. <hi>Heires to a King,</hi> Rom. 8 17. Even to the <hi>King of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
Joh. 17. 22. Rom. 8. 18. 2 Cor. 4. 17. Nor are we his Sons only, but
he accounts us his <hi>precious Jewels,</hi> Mala. 3. 17. And repures us his <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
Friends,</hi> Joh. 15. 14, 15. <hi>Our Friend Lazarus,</hi> saith <hi>Christ,</hi> Joh.
11. 11. O what an high and happy condition is this, for mortal men
to aspire unto; that the <hi>God of Heaven</hi> should not be ashamed to
own them for <hi>friends,</hi> that before were his cursed, and <hi>mortal enemies!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By nature we are like <hi>Nebuchadnezer,</hi> no better than <hi>beasts grazing
in the forrest:</hi> but when grace once comes, we are like him restored to
his reason, and high dignities, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. 29. to the end. Or like <hi>Manasses,</hi>
brought out of a loathsome Prison, to be <hi>King of Jerusalem, 2 Chro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi>
33. 11, 12, 13.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Does any man glory in <hi>riches? Christ</hi> is an unexhaustable
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56896:8"/>
treasure, never failing, and of <hi>his fulness have all we received,</hi> Joh. 1.
16. Nor are these transitory riches, (though these we have also,
when God sees them good for us: For <hi>riches and treasures shall be in
the house of the righteous,</hi> Psal. 112. 3.) but we have <hi>heavenly,</hi> and <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
riches,</hi> that <hi>true Treasure,</hi> that is infinitely <hi>better</hi> than <hi>silver</hi> or <hi>gold,</hi>
and more precious than <hi>Rubies, Pearles,</hi> or any the most <hi>precious stones.</hi>
Yea it surpasseth all <hi>pleasure</hi> and <hi>prosperity, strength, honour</hi> or felicity.
It is more <hi>sweet than the Honey and the Honey-comb; yea all the things thou
canst else desire, are not to be compared to it. Length of daies is in her right
hand, and in her left riches and honour: Her waies are waies of pleasant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and all her paths are peace. She is a tree of life, to them that
lay hold upon her: and happy is every one, that retaineth her,</hi> as <hi>Job, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
and <hi>Solomon</hi> will insure you. <hi>Job. 28. 13. to 20. Psal.</hi> 19. 10 &amp; 119.
103. <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 14 to 19. &amp; 8. 10, 11. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 9. 16. Yea lastly, <hi>Heaven</hi> it
self, is made sure to every gracious soul for her Patrimony, <hi>Mat. 5. 3.</hi>
to 12. Now consider before we go any further, how poor a clod of
earth a <hi>Mannour</hi> is, how poor an inch a <hi>Shire,</hi> how poor a span a
<hi>Kingdom,</hi> how poor a pace, or Acre the <hi>whole earth;</hi> And yet how
many have <hi>sold</hi> their <hi>bodies,</hi> and <hi>souls,</hi> and <hi>consciences,</hi> and <hi>Heaven,</hi> and
<hi>eternity,</hi> for a few grains of this dust.</p>
            <p>Only with <hi>Believers,</hi> it is otherwise, they consider that commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
are but as they are commonly valued: And because transitory
things in the next life, bare no value at all; and because there is <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
firm under the firmament:</hi> They hold it very good covering, what
they may have, and cannot leave behind them. And though others
most loye, what they must leave, and think that money will buy any
thing, like foolish <hi>Magus,</hi> Act 8. 18. Or the <hi>Devil,</hi> who presumed
that this bait, would even catoh the <hi>Son of God:</hi> Yet the wise and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious,
can see no reason, why it should be so doted upon as it
is. But</p>
            <p>Fourthly; Does any one desire or glory in <hi>Liberty? Christ hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
us out of the hands of all our adversaries</hi> and enemies, <hi>Luk. 1. 71,</hi>
74. As namely, from the <hi>Law, Gal. 5. 18.</hi> Rom. 6. 44. From <hi>sinne;</hi>
1 Joh. 2. 1, 2. From <hi>death,</hi> Joh. 8. 51. &amp; 5. 24. And from the <hi>Devil,</hi>
with all the <hi>powers of darknesse,</hi> Heb. 2. 14. Rom. 8. 35. to the end. Or</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Is it safety from fear and danger, that a man wishes for or
desires? Let him become one of <hi>those little ones that believe in Christ;</hi>
then may he trust to a <hi>guard of Angels,</hi> Mat. 18. 10. and be assured of
<hi>Gods protection;</hi> without which a <hi>worm,</hi> or <hi>fly,</hi> may <hi>kill</hi> a man, with
it no <hi>Potentate</hi> on earth can do it. As for Instance, When <hi>Valens</hi>
the persecuting <hi>Emperour,</hi> should have subscribed an order for S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zils
banishment:</hi> such a suddain trembling took his right hand, that he
could write never a good letter, whereupon he tore the order for
anger, and there was an end of the businesse. <hi>Laremouth Chaplain</hi> to
the <hi>Lady Anne of Cleave,</hi> a <hi>Scotchman,</hi> being in Prison in <hi>Queen-Maries</hi>
daies, it was said, as he thought, once, twice, thrice, <hi>Arise and
go thy waies:</hi> whereupon, he arising from prayer, a piece of the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56896:8"/>
               <hi>prison wall</hi> fell down, and he escaped beyond the Seas.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="8" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. VIII.</head>
            <p>Sixthly, Wouldest thou have <hi>God</hi> to prosper all that thou hast, or
doest: then get grace to serve him, so shalt thou be blessed, in all
places, and delivered from all temporal evils, as it is <hi>Deut. 28.</hi> Nor
can it be other in reason. For, if when the <hi>Ark of the Covenant,</hi> (which
was a sign of <hi>Gods</hi> presence) was in the <hi>house of Obed Edom,</hi> then <hi>the
Lord blessed him, and all his house:</hi> how much more shall that man be
blessed? in whose heart even <hi>God</hi> himself, by his Spirit dwels; and
by his grace, which is a more sure, and infallible sign of his presence
then was the <hi>Ark.</hi> So that if thou beest wise, thou wilt more esteem
of <hi>grace,</hi> and <hi>God blessing</hi> accompanying it; than thou wouldest of
<hi>Jasons Golden Fleece:</hi> or the <hi>great Chams Tree-full of Pearles, hanging
by clusters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seventhly, Wouldest thou with all these, have all peace and joy?
than get Grace and Holinesse. For as the <hi>Vnicornes horn</hi> dipped in the
<hi>fountain,</hi> makes the waters which before were corrupt and noysome,
clear and wholesome upon the suddain: so whatsoever estate grace
and godlinesse comes unto, it saith like the <hi>Apostles, Peace be to this
house,</hi> peace and happinesse be to this heart, to this man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That
<hi>Regeneration</hi> is the only best <hi>Physick</hi> for <hi>melancholy,</hi> I can sufficiently
evidence, out of fifty years experience. I most gladly acknowledge,
that when I was in my natural condition, without the pardon of sin,
and some assurance of <hi>Gods</hi> favour: I seldome wakened in a morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but my heart was as heavy as lead; as fearing an hell, after that
purgatory: which since my heart was changed, I have not, I blesse <hi>God,</hi>
been acquainted with. <hi>An old Disciple of Christ,</hi> being asked the cause
why he was ever such a merry man, answered: when I was a young
man, I studied how to <hi>live well;</hi> and when I became an old man, I
studied how to <hi>dye well;</hi> and so desiring to seek <hi>God</hi> in this his <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of grace,</hi> and hoping to see him in his <hi>Kingdom of glory,</hi> one day
to me was better, than a thousand unto those, who weary themselves
in the waies of wickednesse, and destruction.</p>
            <p>Now if grace and <hi>Gods</hi> favour, brings such peace and joy: what
fools are sinners? to deprive themselves of it. What <hi>mad men</hi> are
<hi>Misers?</hi> As how do their <hi>hearts droop</hi> with their <hi>mammon?</hi> How do
they <hi>weary and turmoyl themselves, vex their spirits, torment their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,</hi>
making themselves a very map of misery, and a sinke of calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
Whereas it is nothing so with the servants of <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Perhaps at their first conversion, they are much troubled in mind,
(though it fares not so with all) and conscience; for their long and
grievous offending, so good a <hi>God;</hi> but that <hi>sorrow is</hi> soon <hi>turned into
joy,</hi>
and abundantly recompenced. When the <hi>Angel</hi> had <hi>troubled the
waters,</hi> in the <hi>Pool of Bethesda:</hi> then stept in those that were <hi>diseased,
and infirm;</hi> and were <hi>healed.</hi> It is <hi>Christs</hi> manner, to <hi>trouble our souls</hi>
first, and then to come with <hi>healing in his wings.</hi> Yea the very teares
of repentance are sweet: whereas the covetous mans heart, <hi>even in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56896:9"/>
laughing is sorrowfull, and the end of that mirth us heaviness,</hi> Prov. 14. 13.</p>
            <p>An evil life, saies <hi>Seneca,</hi> causeth an unquiet mind: for as the least
<hi>moat in the eye,</hi> hinders the <hi>ease</hi> and <hi>sight</hi> of it; or as the least <hi>gravell in
the shooe,</hi> hinders the <hi>traveller</hi> in his comfortable <hi>going;</hi> on as the least
<hi>bone in the throat,</hi> hinders our <hi>eating,</hi> and threatens to <hi>choake</hi> us: So
the least <hi>sinne in the soul</hi> unrepented of, hinders the <hi>peace,</hi> and <hi>joy,</hi> and
<hi>hope</hi> thereof. But least (which is not likely) I should glut you with
joy, observe with me</p>
            <p>In the eighth place, That there is nothing can be wanting to a man,
but grace and <hi>Gods</hi> savour will more than supply it. When reverend
<hi>Calvin</hi> was upbraided by the <hi>Papists,</hi> with the <hi>want</hi> of Child<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ad of such
children, given me <hi>many thousand children, of far more excellent kind,</hi>
and of nobler breed through the whole <hi>world.</hi> And surely a man
shall see, the <hi>Noblest works and Foundations,</hi> have proceeded from
<hi>childlesse men:</hi> which have sought to expresse the <hi>Images of their minds,</hi>
where those of their <hi>bodies</hi> have failed.</p>

            <p>Ninthly, <hi>Godlinesse hath the Promises</hi> not only <hi>of this life,</hi> but also <hi>of
that which is to come.</hi> The quintessence whereof consists in these two
things; <hi>freedom from all pain, fruition of all pleasure,</hi> which is the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
of <hi>Christ</hi> for his followers. For when he sits upon his <hi>Throne,</hi>
he shall say unto them, and only to them: <hi>Come ye blessed of my Father,
inherit the Kingdom prepared for you, from before the foundation of the
world: where are such joyes, as eye hath not seen, nor eat heard,</hi> &amp;c.
And are there any <hi>pleasures,</hi> like those <hi>at the right hand of God for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more?</hi>
Whereas to those, that have not had the <hi>grace,</hi> nor the <hi>wit</hi> to
serve him: he shall say, <hi>Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire,
prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi> And is there any pain, like the
separation from <hi>Christ,</hi> into everlasting and ever-flaming fire? <hi>Mat.
25. 41.</hi> Think of this, you that prefer the service of <hi>sinne</hi> and <hi>Satan,</hi>
before that of our <hi>Saviours. Heaven</hi> you will confesse to be <hi>best of all;</hi>
yet for <hi>Heaven</hi> you will use labour <hi>least of all.</hi> For I may boldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
it, your <hi>covetous man, takes more paines to goe to hell; than do the
godly to get to Heaven: he riseth early,</hi> and resteth late, and <hi>eates the</hi>
course <hi>bread of sorrow;</hi> and after a great deal of tedious and odious
misery, goes to the <hi>Devil</hi> for his labour. But look to it, this will one
day cost men dear: For it will be the very <hi>hell of hell,</hi> when they shall
call to mind, that they have <hi>loved their sinnes, more than their Saviour,
or their own souls.</hi> When they shall remember, what love and mercy,
hath been almost enforced upon them; and yet they would by all
meanes, and that of free choice perish.</p>
            <p>Now I might go on to other Particulars, yea I might alomost be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
in these things: but having said <hi>enough,</hi> to be thought <hi>too much:</hi>
I will mention no more, only let me a little apply it. We see that
the <hi>shadow,</hi> does not more inseparably follow the <hi>body:</hi> than all
<hi>blessings</hi> follow <hi>grace. Bodily exercise profiteth little, but godlinesse
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56896:9"/>
is profitable unto all things,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 8. as having <hi>the Promises of the life
present,</hi> and <hi>of that which is to come.</hi> Men talk much of the <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
stone,</hi> that it turneth <hi>copper into gold:</hi> of <hi>Cornucopia,</hi> that it
had all things necessary for food in it: of the <hi>Herb Pana<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e,</hi> that it is
instead of <hi>all purges,</hi> and cureth <hi>all diseases:</hi> of the <hi>Herb Nepenthes,</hi>
that it procureth <hi>all delights:</hi> of <hi>Vulcans Armour,</hi> that it was of proof
against <hi>all thrusts and blows.</hi> Yea, <hi>Pliny</hi> speaks of no lesse, than <hi>three
hundred and sixty benefits;</hi> that may be made of the <hi>Palme tree,</hi> if we
will believe him. But whether these things be so or not, it much
matters not: this I am sure of, that what they did vainly attribute to
these rarities, for <hi>bodily</hi> and <hi>transitory good;</hi> we may with full measure;
and without any hyperbole, justly ascribe to <hi>grace and Gods favour, for
spiritual.</hi> So that <hi>Religion, Piety,</hi> and <hi>Holinesse,</hi> are <hi>Mistresses</hi> worthy
your <hi>service.</hi> Yea, all other <hi>Artes</hi> in the world, are but drudges to
these. Fools may contemn them, who cannot judge of true intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
beauty: but if they had our eyes, they culd not but be ravished
with admiration of the same. And men truly wise, have learned to
<hi>contemn their contempt,</hi> and to pity their injurious ignorance.</p>
            <p>All which being so apparant, and undeniable: mens wisest and
surest way were, as one would think, to become the Servants of <hi>God,</hi>
and be as industrious after <hi>grace,</hi> as they have been after <hi>gold.</hi> For
in common reason, who would eat <hi>huskes</hi> with the <hi>Prodigal,</hi> when if

<hi>heavenly Father?</hi> have so good cheer and banqueting, hear so great
melody, joy and triumph? Generally, men are very eager and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious
to <hi>get worldly wealth;</hi> yea, no pains is thought too much for
it: but where shall we finde men thus eager after <hi>spiritual wealth,</hi>
which alone can make them happy?</p>

               <hi>Objection:</hi> But will some say, How shall we obtain this happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition?
It is not so easie a matter to become gracious, and to gain the
favour of <hi>God,</hi> as you seem to make it.</p>
            <p>I Answer Yes, this may easily be helped, if thou hast a mind to it.
For as when a man would have <hi>those things</hi> to be <hi>on his right hand,</hi>
which are now <hi>on his left:</hi> it is but <hi>turning himself,</hi> and the work is
done: so do but <hi>turn you affections from earthly things, to things celesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al

               </hi> a <hi>mad man</hi> to his <hi>senses,</hi> a <hi>prisoner
set at liberty,</hi> a <hi>begger advanced</hi> to a vast estate, and as one <hi>vexed with
an evil spirit,</hi> or troubled with a <hi>tormenting conscience,</hi> to such a blessed
<hi>peace, as the world can neither give nor take away,</hi> John 14. 27. As
thus:</p>
            <p>Would you quiet your clamorous conscience, that will not be
friends with you, unlesse you be friends with <hi>God?</hi> The <hi>ayer</hi> is not
so <hi>cleer,</hi> when the <hi>clowde is dissolved</hi> by <hi>rain,</hi> as the <hi>mind is,</hi> when
the <hi>clowdes</hi> of our <hi>iniquities</hi> are dissolved by the rain, or <hi>tears of true
repentance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> These <hi>waters;</hi> are the <hi>red sea;</hi> wherein the whole Arm
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56896:10"/>
of our <hi>sinnes</hi> is <hi>drowned.</hi> As O the calm spirit of a godly man! his
very dreams are divine.</p>
            <p>When Ptolomy King of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> had posed the <hi>Seaventy Interpreters</hi>
in order, and asked the <hi>nineteenth</hi> man, what would make one <hi>sleep
quietly in the night:</hi> he told him the best way was, to have divine and
celestial Meditations, and to use honest actions and recreations <hi>in the
day time.</hi> The godly man enjoyes <hi>Heaven</hi> upon <hi>earth, peace of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
and <hi>joy in the Holy Ghost,</hi> 1 Thes. 1. 6. Nor is <hi>joy</hi> lesse, when it is
least expressed, (as it fares with <hi>grief</hi>) but as <hi>the windowes of the
Temple</hi> were <hi>narrow</hi> without, but <hi>broad</hi> within; so is the joy of our
hearts, greater than it does outwardly appear to the world.</p>
            <p>Again, It is as falfe a slander as common, that when once a man
imbraceth <hi>Religion,</hi> farewell all joy and delight. For virtue hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
so crabbed a face, nor so stern a look, as men make her. Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
is not gone, when sinne is gone. It is not <hi>Isaac</hi> that is <hi>sacrificed,</hi>
that is our <hi>laughter</hi> and <hi>mirth;</hi> but the <hi>Ramme,</hi> that is the bruitishnesse
of it. <hi>The soul of joy,</hi> lies in the <hi>souls joy.</hi> What saies <hi>holy David? Be
glad ye righteous, and rejoyce in the Lord; and be joyfull all ye that are
upright in heart,</hi> Psal. 32. 11. It was not the <hi>Eunuchs riches,</hi> nor ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
but his <hi>faith,</hi> which set him on his <hi>way rejoycing,</hi> Act. 8. 39. <hi>In
this rejoyce no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> (saith <hi>our Saviour,) that the spirits are subdued unto
you: but rather rejoyce, that your names are written in Heaven,</hi>
Luke 10. 20. Yea, there is even <hi>joy in grief,</hi> where the <hi>sorrow is for
sinne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Besides, how can men partake of that fountain of joy, and rejoyce
not? He is no good <hi>Christian,</hi> that is not taken with the glory he shall
have, and <hi>rejoyce that his name is written in the Book of life.</hi> The world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
man hath <hi>joy in prosperity,</hi> the Child of <hi>God</hi> in <hi>adversity.</hi> The believing
<hi>Hebrews suffered with joy, the spoyling of their goods, knowing that they
had in Heaven, a better and more enduring substance,</hi> Heb. 10. 34. Yea,
let the worst that can come, they are still merry and joyfull: as hath
been observed in sundry of the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> who clapt their hands for
joy, even in the midst of the flames. And reason good, when <hi>all
things shall work to their good, that are good:</hi> and when the very
draught, and <hi>abridgment of Heaven,</hi> is in every sanctified heart upon
earth.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>live religiously,</hi> and thou shalt both <hi>live and die comfortably:</hi>
For <hi>live in grace,</hi> and <hi>die in peace,</hi> is a rule that never fails. Only this
hinders our joy, our <hi>love to spiritual things</hi> is <hi>too defective; of worldly
things too excessive. Earthly goods</hi> are earnestly and <hi>eagerly</hi> sought after;
<hi>Heavenly not</hi> once <hi>thought upon. Much travell</hi> taken for the <hi>body, little</hi>
or no care used <hi>for the soul.</hi> It would be otherwise, if with <hi>Paul</hi> at
his conversion, they had those <hi>scales</hi> taken away <hi>from their eyes,</hi> by
some <hi>godly Ananias,</hi> some faithfull <hi>Minister of the Gospel:</hi> which du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
their natural condition, covers their eyes from seeing things spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual.
It is a sad thing to see, what <hi>fools</hi> men are, that <hi>walk according
to the flesh;</hi> and how they are gulled by the <hi>God of this world,</hi> and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56896:10"/>
their own <hi>deceitfull hearts.</hi> The <hi>covetous man</hi> is like <hi>a mad man,</hi> that
loves and is unmeasurably delighted, with the sight and <hi>gingling</hi> of
those <hi>chains,</hi> wherewith he is <hi>fettered</hi> and tormented. He hugs them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
(I mean his money) and adores them; and even makes them his
<hi>god,</hi> that occasion him all his grief. But had he once <hi>tasted how good,
and bountifull the Lord is,</hi> to those that set their delight on him, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi>
2. 3. If he did <hi>grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Jesus Christ,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 18. If the Lord, would once <hi>incline</hi> his <hi>heart
unto his testimonies, and not to covetousnesse,</hi> Psal. 119. 36. he should
soon know and find, that <hi>things</hi> themselves are in the <hi>invisible world;</hi>
in the <hi>world visible,</hi> but their <hi>shaddows</hi> only. That wicked men injoy
whatsoever they have, <hi>viz. wealth, honour, wisdome, pleasure,</hi> &amp;c. but
as it were in a dream. They <hi>dream</hi> they are <hi>rich, wise, happy,</hi> and the
like; as a <hi>begger</hi> may <hi>dream he is a King:</hi> Or one that is ready to <hi>starve,</hi>
that he is richly furnished with all manner <hi>of meats and drinkes:</hi> but
when once he is awake, he findes himself grossely mistaken. All
worldly happinesse, hath its being only by opinion: whence S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

calls all <hi>Agrippa</hi>'s <hi>pomp, but a fancy,</hi> Act. 25. 23. a meer conceit or sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.
The <hi>sweetnesse of sinne,</hi> is but as the <hi>sweetnesse of poyson:
sweet</hi> only <hi>in the mouth,</hi> in the <hi>belly bitter</hi> and <hi>deadly. Stolen bread is
sweet; sweet</hi> in the obtaining, bitter in the account and reckoning. Yea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
this <hi>last dish,</hi> will <hi>spoyl</hi> all <hi>the feast;</hi> and make it but like a <hi>drop of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,</hi>
before a <hi>river of sorrow</hi> and displeasure: Whereas whatsoever

that <hi>any thing,</hi> that <hi>every thing,</hi> were too small a price for it. Their

with earthly trash, which the godly so little regard. A main
cause is this; Men of the world, as they know not what the riches of
the mind means, so they have no hope of a better life after this. This
is <hi>all their Heaven,</hi> and here they have <hi>all their portion,</hi> they are like to
have, <hi>Psal. 73. 12. Deliver my soul from the wicked,</hi> (saith <hi>David)
from men of the world, who have their portion in this life: whose bellyes
thou fillest with thy hid treasure; their children have enough, and leave
the rest of their substance to their babes,</hi> Psal. 17. 14. But my teeth shall
not water after their dainties. <hi>Wo be to you that are rich,</hi> (saith our
<hi>Saviour) for ye have received your consolation,</hi> Luke 6. 24. <hi>All here,
none hereafter:</hi> and hereupon they covet riches, and honours, and
pleasures so excessively, and insatiably. Nor can it be otherwise in
reason; for nothing but the assurance of <hi>heavenly things,</hi> makes us wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to part with <hi>earthly things.</hi> Neither can he contemn this life, that
knows not the other. But this is the priviledge of Piety; The <hi>rich
man,</hi> hath not so much advantage of the <hi>poor</hi> in <hi>injoying,</hi> as the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>poor</hi> hath of the <hi>rich</hi> in <hi>leaving.</hi> Neither is the poor man, so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
pounds behind the rich for <hi>this world,</hi> as he may be talents before
him for the <hi>world to come.</hi> So that there is no learning this art, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being religious: For you will be <hi>covetous, untill</hi> you be <hi>gracious.</hi>
And during the time of your greedinesse, you shall never be satisfied;
because happinesse is tied to goodnesse, by the chain of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>

            <p>Now if thou wouldest become godly in good earnest; if thou
wouldst have this change wrought in thee, and have thy affections
so altered, as to find more sweetnesse in spiritual things, than ever
thou hast done in thy worldly enjoyments, be sure to begin at <hi>the
spring head,</hi> I mean <hi>thy heart.</hi> This is <hi>Gods</hi> own counsel to the <hi>men of
Jerusalem, Jer. 4. O Jerusalem, wash thine heart from wickednesse, that
thou maist be saved. How long shall thy wicked thoughts remain with
thee?</hi> vers. 14. It is idle and to no purpose, to <hi>purge the channell,</hi>
when the <hi>fountain</hi> is <hi>corrupt.</hi> Had <hi>Elisha cast</hi> the <hi>salt into the brooks</hi> and
<hi>ditches,</hi> the remedy must have striven <hi>against the stream,</hi> to reach up
to the <hi>springs:</hi> Now it was but one labour in curing the fountain.
Our <hi>heart</hi> is <hi>a well of bitter venomous water,</hi> our <hi>actions</hi> are the <hi>streams:</hi>
in vain shall we cleanse our <hi>hands,</hi> while our <hi>hearts</hi> are evil. Whence
the <hi>Apostle</hi> orderly bids us, <hi>first be renewed in the spirit of our minds,</hi>
and <hi>then let him that stole, steal no more,</hi> Ephes. 4. 23, 24, 8. But alas, how
many are there that set the <hi>cart before the horse,</hi> and begin to change
their lives, before their hearts? but if we shall be <hi>advised</hi> so to do,
it is not <hi>advisedly.</hi> It is most ridiculous, to apply <hi>remedyes</hi> to the
<hi>outer-parts,</hi> when the <hi>distemper</hi> lies in the <hi>stomach.</hi> He were an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfull
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56896:12"/>
               <hi>Physician,</hi> that when the <hi>head-ach</hi> is caused by the distempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the <hi>stomach,</hi> would apply <hi>outward remedies to the head,</hi> before
he had <hi>purged the stomach,</hi> where lies the matter that feeds the <hi>disease.</hi>
To what purpose is it, to <hi>crop</hi> the top of the <hi>weeds,</hi> or <hi>lop</hi> off the
<hi>boughes</hi> of the <hi>tree,</hi> when the <hi>root</hi> and <hi>stalk</hi> remain in the <hi>earth?</hi> Cut
off the <hi>sprig</hi> of a tree, it grows still, a <hi>bough,</hi> an <hi>arm,</hi> still it grows;
lop off the <hi>top,</hi> yea saw it in the <hi>midst,</hi> yet it will grow again;
<hi>stock</hi> it up by the <hi>root,</hi> then (and not till then) it will grow no
more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Great Cities</hi> once expunged, the <hi>Dorpes</hi> and <hi>Villages</hi> will soon come
in of themselves. Wherefore, as the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Syria</hi> said unto his
<hi>Captains, Fight neither against great nor small, but against the King of
Israel,</hi> 1 Kings 22. 31. So especially we must set our selves, against our
<hi>mother</hi> and <hi>Master sinne:</hi> the <hi>King</hi> being caught, the rest will never
stand out. The <hi>heart</hi> is <hi>originally</hi> evil, that is the <hi>treasure</hi> and <hi>storehouse
of wickednesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As in <hi>generation,</hi> so in <hi>regeneration: Cor primum vivit:</hi> life begins at
the heart. Yea, the heart is the <hi>first</hi> in our <hi>Creation,</hi> which is <hi>formed;</hi>
the <hi>first</hi> by reason of our <hi>fall</hi> by sinne, which is <hi>deformed;</hi> and the
first in our <hi>regeneration</hi> that is <hi>reformed.</hi> And whensoever <hi>God</hi> does
savingly shine upon the <hi>understanding,</hi> he giveth a <hi>soft</hi> and pliable <hi>heart.</hi>
For without a work upon the heart by the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
its own inclination to that which it affecteth, whatsoever the
judgment shall say to the contrary. That must <hi>first</hi> be <hi>reformed,</hi>
which was <hi>first deformed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Out of the abundance of the heart</hi> (saith our <hi>Saviour) the mouth
speaketh,</hi> Mat. 12. 34. Yea out of the abundance of the heart, the
<hi>head deviseth, the eye seeth,</hi> the <hi>ear heareth,</hi> the <hi>hand worketh,</hi> the <hi>foot
walketh.</hi> A man may apply his <hi>ears,</hi> and his <hi>eyes,</hi> (as many blockheads
do) to his <hi>Book</hi> and yet never prove <hi>Scholar:</hi> but from that day,
which a man begins to apply his <hi>heart unto wisdome,</hi> he learneth more
in <hi>a moneth after,</hi> than he did in <hi>a year before;</hi> nay, than ever he did in
all his life. As you see the wicked, because they apply their hearts
to wickednesse, how fast they proceed? how easily, and how
quickly they become perfect <hi>Swearers,</hi> perfect <hi>Drunkards,</hi> cunning
<hi>Deceivers,</hi> &amp;c.?</p>
            <p>The heart is like <hi>the fire, which kindleth the sacrifice,</hi> 1 Kings 18. 38.
And indeed, if the <hi>tongue,</hi> or the <hi>hand,</hi> or the <hi>ear,</hi> think to serve
<hi>God</hi> without the <hi>heart,</hi> it is the irksomest occupation in the world.
But as the <hi>Sunne riseth</hi> first, and then the <hi>beasts</hi> arise from their <hi>dens,</hi>
the <hi>fowles</hi> from their <hi>nests,</hi> and <hi>men</hi> from their <hi>beds:</hi> so when the
heart sets forward to serve <hi>God,</hi> all the members will follow after it;
the <hi>tongue</hi> will <hi>praise</hi> him, the <hi>foot</hi> will <hi>follow</hi> him, the <hi>ear</hi> will <hi>attend</hi>
him, the <hi>eye</hi> will <hi>watch</hi> him, the <hi>hand</hi> will <hi>serve</hi> him, nothing will
stay after the <hi>heart,</hi> but every one goes like <hi>Handmaids</hi> after their
<hi>Mistresse.</hi> Such as the <hi>heart</hi> is, such are the <hi>actions</hi> of the <hi>body</hi> which
proceed from the heart. <hi>A good man out of the good treasure of his heart,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56896:12"/>
bringeth forth good things: and an evil man, out of the evil treasure of his
heart, bringeth forth evil things,</hi> Matth. 12. 25. Therefore as <hi>Christ
saith, Make clean within, and all will be clean,</hi> Matth, 35. 25, 26. So see
your <hi>hearts</hi> be <hi>sincere</hi> and <hi>single,</hi> and then all your <hi>actions</hi> will be <hi>holy
to the Lord.</hi> If we would be rid of <hi>noysome fowles,</hi> the only way is to
destroy <hi>their nests</hi> in every place. A vain and lost labour it is, to stop
the <hi>current</hi> of a <hi>stream,</hi> if you go not to the <hi>fountain.</hi> Whence it is
that <hi>God</hi> faith, <hi>Give me thine heart,</hi> Prov. 23. 26. As though he would
teach us the pleasantest, and easiest way to serve him, without any
grudging, or toyl, or wearisomenesse. As let but the heart be chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and we shall attend the <hi>Ordinances,</hi> and perform all <hi>duties</hi> with

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, cheerfulnesse and alacrity. Whereas to <hi>a carnal heart, holy
duties,</hi> as <hi>fasting, praying, hearing,</hi> is so tedious and irksome, that it
thinks <hi>one Sabboth,</hi> or <hi>Fast-day,</hi> more tedious and burdensome, than
<hi>ten holy daies,</hi> as their consciences will hear me witnesse. Whereas
the gracious soul, is more delighted therewith, than his <hi>body</hi> with a
well relished <hi>meal.</hi> Touch but the first <hi>linke of a chain,</hi> and all the
rest will follow: so set but the <hi>heart</hi> a going, and it is like the <hi>poyse of
a clock,</hi> which turns all the <hi>wheels</hi> one way: such an <hi>oyl</hi> is upon the
heart, that it makes all <hi>nimble</hi> and current about it: but without the
heart, all is mute and dumb. As the <hi>tongue</hi> will not <hi>praise,</hi> because
the <hi>heart</hi> doth not <hi>love;</hi> the <hi>ear</hi> doth not <hi>hear,</hi> because the <hi>heart</hi>
does not <hi>mind;</hi> the <hi>hand</hi> does not <hi>give,</hi> because the <hi>heart</hi> does not
<hi>pitty;</hi> the <hi>foot</hi> will not <hi>go,</hi> because the <hi>heart</hi> hath no <hi>affection.</hi> All stay
upon the <hi>heart,</hi> like the <hi>Captain</hi> that should give the <hi>onset.</hi> Nor is any
service we can do accepted, without the <hi>heart and affections flowing
thence.</hi> Therefore <hi>Davids</hi> prayer is, <hi>Create in me a new heart, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
a right spirit within me,</hi> Psal. 51. 10. The <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi>
did <hi>fast,</hi> and <hi>watch,</hi> and <hi>pray,</hi> and <hi>hear,</hi> and <hi>read,</hi> and <hi>give,</hi> and <hi>do</hi>
all that we can do: and yet <hi>Christ rewarded</hi> all their works with a
<hi>wo,</hi> because they wanted a good heart, and true affections flowing
thence. They <hi>honoured God with their lips, but their hearts were far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from him.</hi> Whence he also calls them <hi>hypocrites,</hi> Mark. 7. 6.
The <hi>Disciple</hi> that <hi>betrayed Christ,</hi> heard as much as the <hi>Disciples</hi> that

his conversion, could do as much, as the best accomplished <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralist</hi>
of them all; his words are, <hi>If any man thinketh, that he hath
whereof he might trust in the flesh, much more I,</hi> Phil. 3. 4. Yet when he
speaks of his doing, or suffering, he sheweth that it was <hi>because the
love of God, was shed abroad in his heart, by the holy Ghost, which was
given him,</hi> Rom. 5. 5. Of himself he could <hi>do nothing,</hi> though he were
able to <hi>do all things, through Christ,</hi> and by the Spirits assistance, <hi>who
strengthened him,</hi> Phil. 4. 13. <hi>Man</hi> is like an <hi>Organ-pipe,</hi> that <hi>speakes</hi>
no longer then <hi>wind</hi> is blown into it. Wherefore as when <hi>David</hi>
came to fight with <hi>Goliah,</hi> he cast away <hi>Sauls armour:</hi> so let us in this
case, cast away all trust and confidence in our selves, and only set
forward in the Name of the <hi>Lord God of Israel.</hi> If we trust to our
own resistance, <hi>we cannot stand: we cannot miscarry,</hi> if we trust to
his.</p>
            <p>Yet this is to be considered, that <hi>God</hi> does not work upon us as
upon <hi>blocks,</hi> and <hi>stones,</hi> in all and every respect <hi>passive:</hi> but <hi>converts
our wils, to will our own conversion.</hi> He that <hi>made</hi> thee without thy
self, will not <hi>justifie,</hi> nor <hi>save</hi> thee without thy self: Without thy
merit indeed, not without thine endeavour. When those <hi>deadly wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
were <hi>healed</hi> by the <hi>Prophet,</hi> the outward act must be his, the
power <hi>Gods:</hi> he cast the <hi>salt into the spring,</hi> and said, <hi>Thus saith the
Lord, I have healed these waters, there shall not be from thence, any more
death or barrennesse. Elisha</hi> was the <hi>Instrument,</hi> but far was he from
challenging ought to himself.</p>
            <p>Wherefore be sure to use that power, which <hi>Christ</hi> shall give thee,
and then my soul for thine, he will not be wanting on his part. And
amongst other thine endeavour, exercise <hi>Prayer:</hi> Omit not to <hi>beg of
God,</hi> for the grace thou <hi>wantest,</hi> and <hi>praise him</hi> for what thou <hi>obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est.</hi>
Abhor to attribute, or ascribe ought to thy doing: trust only

            <p>Lastly, For conclusion of this point, Wouldst thou be <hi>a contented
and Happy man?</hi> then strive to <hi>be a Thankefull man:</hi> and when <hi>God</hi>
hath the <hi>fruit</hi> of his mercies, he will not spare to <hi>sow much,</hi> where he
<hi>reapes much.</hi> Wouldest thou become <hi>thankefull?</hi> then <hi>bethink thy self</hi>
what cause thou hast, by calling to mind and considering, <hi>what God
and Christ hath done for thee.</hi> As first, That he is the <hi>Authour of thy natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
life:</hi> For <hi>in him we live, and move, and have our being,</hi> Act. 17.
28. Secondly, Of thy <hi>spiritual life:</hi> Thus <hi>I live,</hi> saies <hi>Paul, yet not
I now, but Christ liveth in me,</hi> Gal. 2. 20. Thirdly, Of thy <hi>eternal life,</hi>
1 Joh. 1. <hi>He is the way, the truth, and the life,</hi> John 14. 6. <hi>The resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
and the life,</hi> John 11. 25.</p>
            <p>Or more particularly thus: In the first place, He <hi>gave us our selves,</hi>
and all the <hi>creatures</hi> to be <hi>our servants;</hi> yea, he <hi>created us after his
own Image, in righteousnesse and holinesse, and in perfect knowledge of the
truth,</hi> with a power to stand, and for ever to continue in a most bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and happy condition; and this deserves all possible thankfulnesse.
But this was nothing in comparison. For when we were in a sad
condition; when we had forfeited all this, and our selves: when by
sinne we had turned that <hi>Image of God,</hi> into the <hi>Image of Satan,</hi> and
wilfully plunged our souls and bodies into eternal torments; when
we were become his enemies, mortally hating him, and to our utmost
fighting against him, and taking part with his only enemies, <hi>(Sin</hi>
and <hi>Satan)</hi> not having the least thought or desire of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilement,
but a perverse and obstinate will to resist all means tending
thereunto; He did redeem us, not only without asking, but even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
our wils: so making of us (his cursed enemies) servants, of
servants <hi>sons,</hi> of sons <hi>heirs,</hi> and <hi>coheirs with Christ,</hi> Gal 4. 7. Here was
a fathomlesse depth, a wonder beyond all wonders!</p>
            <p>2. But that we may the better consider what an alms or boon
<hi>God</hi> gave us, when he gave us his Son: Observe, that when neither
<hi>Heaven, Earth,</hi> nor <hi>Hell,</hi> could have yielded any satisfactory thing,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56896:14"/>
besides <hi>Christ</hi> that could have satisfied <hi>Gods</hi> justice, and merited <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>
for us, then, O then! <hi>God,</hi> in his infinite wisdom and goodnesse,
did not only find out a way to satisfie his Justice and the Law, but
<hi>gave us his Sonne, his only begotten Son,</hi> his only beloved Son out of his
bosome: And his Son gave himself to die, even the most shamefull,
painfull, and cursed death of the Crosse <hi>to redeem us; that whosoever
believeth in him, should not perish, but have everlasting life,</hi> John 3. 16.
The very thought of which death, before he come to it, together
with the weight and burthen of our sinnes, put him into such an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gony
in the Garden, that it made him to <hi>sweat, even drops of blood.</hi>
A mercy bestowed, and a way found out, that may astonish all the
sonnes of <hi>men</hi> on <hi>earth,</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> in <hi>Heaven!</hi> Wherefore, O won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
at this, you that wonder at nothing! That the Lord should come
with such a price to redeem our worse than lost souls, and to bring
salvation to us, even against our wils. The <hi>Lord Jesus Christ being
rich, for our sakes became poor, that we through his poverty might be made
rich,</hi> 2 Cor. 8. 9. Even the eternal <hi>God</hi> would die, that we might not
die eternally; O the deepnesse of <hi>Gods</hi> love! O the unmeasurable
measure of his bounty! O Son of <hi>God!</hi> who can sufficiently expresse
thy love? Or, commend thy pity? Or, extol thy praise? It was a
wonder, that thou madest us for thy self, more that thou madest thy
self man for us; but most of all, that thou shouldest unmake thy self,
that thou shouldest die to save us.</p>
            <p>3. And which is further considerable, It cost <hi>God</hi> more to redeem
the world, than to make it. In the <hi>Creation</hi> he gave thee <hi>thy self;</hi> but
in the <hi>Redemption</hi> he gave thee himself. The <hi>Creation</hi> of all things
<hi>cost</hi> him but <hi>six daies</hi> to finish it; the <hi>Redemption</hi> of man cost him
<hi>three and thirty years.</hi> In the <hi>Creation of the world</hi> he did but only
<hi>speak</hi> the word; in the <hi>Redemption of man,</hi> he both <hi>spake</hi> and <hi>wept,</hi>
and <hi>sweat,</hi> and <hi>bled,</hi> and <hi>died,</hi> and did <hi>many</hi> wonderfull <hi>things</hi> to
do it: Yea, the <hi>saving of one soul</hi> single, is more and greater than
the <hi>making</hi> of the <hi>whole world.</hi> In every new <hi>creature</hi> are a number
of <hi>Miracles;</hi> a <hi>blinde</hi> man is <hi>restored</hi> to <hi>sight,</hi> a <hi>deaf</hi> man to <hi>hearing,</hi>
a man <hi>possest</hi> with many Devils <hi>dis-possest;</hi> yea, a <hi>dead</hi> man raised
from the <hi>dead,</hi> and in every one a <hi>stone</hi> turned into <hi>flesh,</hi> in all which
God <hi>meers</hi> with nothing but <hi>opposition,</hi> which in the <hi>Creation</hi> he met
not with.</p>
            <p>What shall I say? <hi>God</hi> of his goodnesse hath bestowed so many and
so great mercies upon us, that it is not possible to expresse his bounty
therein; for if we look <hi>inward,</hi> we find our <hi>Creators</hi> mercies; if we
look <hi>upward,</hi> his mercy reacheth unto the <hi>Heavens; if downwards,</hi> the
<hi>earth</hi> is full of his goodnesse, and so is the broad Sea; if we look <hi>about
us,</hi> what is it that he hath not given us? <hi>Air</hi> to breathe in, <hi>fire</hi> to warm
us, <hi>water</hi> to cool and cleanse us, <hi>cloathes</hi> to cover us, <hi>food</hi> to nourish
us, <hi>fruits</hi> to refresh us; yea, <hi>Delicates</hi> to please us, <hi>Beasts</hi> to serve us,
<hi>Angels</hi> to attend us, <hi>Heaven</hi> to receive us; And which is above all,
<hi>Himself</hi> and his own <hi>Son</hi> to be injoyed of us. So that whethersoever
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56896:14"/>
we turn our <hi>eyes,</hi> we cannot look besides his bounty; yea, we can
scarce think of any thing more to pray for, but that he would continue
those blessings, which he hath bestowed on us already. Yet we co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet
still, as though we <hi>had nothing,</hi> and <hi>live</hi> as if we knew nothing of
all this his beneficence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>God</hi> might have said before we were formed, Let them be <hi>Toads,
Monsters, Infidels, Beggars, Cripples, Bond-slaves, Idiots,</hi> or <hi>Mad men,</hi>
so long as they live, and after that <hi>Castawayes for ever, and ever:</hi> But
he hath made us to the <hi>best likenesse,</hi> and nursed us in the best <hi>Religion,</hi>
and <hi>placed</hi> us in the best <hi>Land,</hi> and appointed us to the best, and only
<hi>Inheritance,</hi> even to remain in <hi>blisse</hi> with him for ever; yea, thousands
would think themselves happy, if they had but a piece of our <hi>happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi>
For whereas some <hi>bleed,</hi> we <hi>sleep</hi> in safety; others <hi>beg,</hi> we <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound;</hi>
others <hi>starve,</hi> we are <hi>full fed;</hi> others <hi>grope in the dark,</hi> our
<hi>Sun</hi> still <hi>shines;</hi> we have <hi>eyes, ears, tongue, feet, hands, health, liberty,
reson,</hi> others are <hi>blind, deaf, dumb,</hi> are <hi>sick, mained, imprisoned, distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
and the like;</hi> yea, <hi>God</hi> hath <hi>removed</hi> so many <hi>evils from us,</hi> and
<hi>conferred</hi> so many <hi>good things upon us,</hi> that they are beyond <hi>thought</hi> or
<hi>imagination.</hi> For all those millions of mercies that we have received
from, before, and since we were born, either for soul or body, even
to the least bit of bread we eat, or shall to eternity, (of which we
could not well want any one) <hi>Christ hath</hi> purchased of his Father
for us, and yet <hi>God</hi> the Father also, hath of his free grace, and mercy
given us, in giving us his Son; for which read <hi>Psal.</hi> 68. 19. &amp; 145 15,
16. &amp; 75, 6, 7, Yea, <hi>God</hi> is many times working our good, when we
least think upon him: as he was creating <hi>Adam</hi> an help meet for him,
when he was fast asleep. And as much do we owe unto God, for
the dangers from which he delivereth us: as for the great wealth and
dignities whereunto he hath alwaies raised us.</p>

when you want them,</hi> and <hi>whom</hi> to <hi>thank when you have them.</hi> For as the
<hi>Sea</hi> is that <hi>great Cistern,</hi> to recieve the confluence of all <hi>waters:</hi> as
first from that large and vast <hi>pond, water</hi> is derived into all parts of the

empty themselves again into the <hi>Sea:</hi> so all <hi>blessings</hi> come <hi>from God,</hi>
and all <hi>praises</hi> must be returned <hi>to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we <hi>have</hi> any thing that is <hi>good, God</hi> is the <hi>giver</hi> of it. If we do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing <hi>well,</hi> he is the <hi>Authour</hi> of it. <hi>God</hi> is <hi>Alpha,</hi> the <hi>fountain</hi> from
which all <hi>grace springs;</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the <hi>sea</hi> to which all <hi>glory</hi> runnes.
All <hi>blessings</hi> come from him, like so many <hi>lines</hi> from the <hi>center</hi> to the
<hi>circumference:</hi> therefore we must return all <hi>praises</hi> to him, like so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>lines</hi> from the <hi>circumference</hi> to the <hi>center, Rom. 11. 36. 1 Cor. 10. 31.</hi>
His <hi>wisdom</hi> he communicates, and his <hi>justice</hi> he distributes; and his <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse</hi>
he imparts, and his <hi>mercy</hi> he bestowes, <hi>&amp;c. 1 Cor</hi> 1. 30, 31. but
his <hi>glory he will not give to another,</hi> Isai. 42. 8.</p>
            <p>But this is not all; yea, what can we think of, that can be thought
sufficient, to render unto <hi>the Lord our God, so good and gracious,</hi> in way
of thankfulnesse for all these his mercies? For in reason hath he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
so many waies to <hi>save us;</hi> and should not we take all occasions
to <hi>glorifie him?</hi> Hath he done so much <hi>for us,</hi> and shall we deny him
any thing that he requireth of us, though it were our <hi>lives,</hi> yea our
<hi>souls;</hi> much more our <hi>lusts?</hi> We have exceeding <hi>hard hearts,</hi> if the
<hi>blood</hi> of the <hi>Lamb</hi> cannot soften them: <hi>stony bowels,</hi> if so many mercies
cannot melt them. Was <hi>Christ</hi> crucified for our sins? and should we
by our sins crucifie him again?</p>
            <p>Now the meditation of what God and Christ hath done for thee,
will wonderfully inflame thee with the love of <hi>God,</hi> and thy <hi>Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;</hi>
and withall make thee abhor thy self, for thy former unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse.
It will make thee break out into some such expression as
this, <hi>Praised be the Lord, even the God of our salvation, who loadeth us
daily with benefits, Selah, Psal. 68. 19. The eyes of all wait upon thee,
and thou givest them their meat, in due season; thou openest thine hand,
and fillest all things living of thy good pleasure,</hi> Psal. 145. 15, 16. <hi>To come
to promotion, is neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south:
but God is the Judge, he maketh low, and he maketh high,</hi> Psal. 75. 6, 7.
And so of all other mercies and deliverances.</p>
            <p>He that confers a Benefit, upon a gratefull nature, robs him of his
liberty, and self also: and in one and the same act makes him a vassal,
and himself his Master. Wherefore if we have any ingenuity in us, it
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56896:15"/>
will make us to direct all our <hi>thoughts, speeches,</hi> and <hi>actions</hi> to his <hi>glory,</hi>
as he hath directed our <hi>eternal salvation</hi> thereunto.</p>
            <p>But to help and further you herein, if you be willing so to do, take
these few Directions.</p>
            <p>First, Let these things be never out of the <hi>minds, memories,</hi> and
<hi>mouthes</hi> of those whom <hi>Christ hath done thus for.</hi> O let us (I say)
<hi>remember,</hi> as we should <hi>never forget! Si totum me debeo pro me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> facto,
quid jam reddam pro me refecto,</hi> saith holy <hi>Bernard.</hi> If I owed my whole
self unto thee, for giving me <hi>my self</hi> in my <hi>creation:</hi> what have I left
to pay for giving <hi>thy self</hi> for me to so cruel a death, to procure my <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,</hi>
which was not so cheap as my Creation? Great was the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifit
that thou wouldst <hi>create me of nothing;</hi> but what tongue can
sufficiently expresse the greatnesse of this grace, that thou didst <hi>redeem</hi>
me with so dear a price, <hi>when</hi> I was <hi>worse than nothing?</hi> We are full of
thy goodnesse: O let our hearts run over with thankfulnesse! Yea,
let so many of us, as have either <hi>heart</hi> or <hi>brain,</hi> in the next place say,
<hi>O Lord, What is man that thou art so mindfull of him?</hi> Psal. 8. 4. And
<hi>O man,</hi> what is God that thou art so <hi>unmindfull</hi> of him? And then
conclude with, <hi>What shall I render unto thee, O Lord, for all these thy
benefits?</hi> but <hi>love</hi> thee my <hi>Creatour,</hi> and <hi>Redeemer,</hi> and become a <hi>new
creature.</hi> I will serve thee, <hi>O Lord,</hi> by the assistance of thy grace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
thou hast given me <hi>my self:</hi> but much more honour thee, because
thou hast given me <hi>thy Son Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor can any man in common reason meditate so unbottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a love, and not study and strive for an answerably thankfull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanure.
If a <hi>friend</hi> had given us but a thousand part of what <hi>God</hi>
hath, we should heartily love him all our lives, and think no thanks
sufficient, but to him that hath given me all things, I have scarce given
so much as thanks. Yea, I have striven to multiply offences against
him, and to make them as infinite in number as his blessings.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The continual meditation of What <hi>God</hi> hath done for thee,
will make thee do, what thou art able for him again. For did <hi>God</hi>
and <hi>Christ,</hi> do all this for us? and shall we do nothing for him again?
Like favours, require like gratitude.</p>
            <p>This then, should at least make us part with our <hi>nearest, dearest,</hi> and
<hi>sweetest darling sins,</hi> to serve him in <hi>righteousnesse</hi> and <hi>holinesse</hi> every
<hi>day,</hi> every <hi>hour,</hi> all the <hi>daies</hi> of our <hi>lives.</hi> Even every sin; for what sin
should be so dear to us, as <hi>Gods</hi> only Son was to him? Do we then
for <hi>Gods sake</hi> not spare our <hi>dearest sin;</hi> when <hi>God</hi> for <hi>our sakes,</hi> did not
spare his <hi>dearest Son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, what a bruitish and barbarous unthankfulnesse, and shame
were it, that <hi>God</hi> should part with his Son, and his Son with his own
precious blood for us, and we not part with our sinfull lusts, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
for him?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Hath <hi>Christ</hi> done all this for us, his servants, so much, and
so many waies obliged unto him? let us do what we are able for him
again. 1. Let us be zealous for his glory, and take his part when we
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56896:16"/>
see or hear him dishonouted. Nor can there be any love, where there is
no zeal, saith <hi>Augustine.</hi> Well-born Children are touched to the quick,
with the injuries of their Parents. And it is a base, vile, and unjust in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude
in those men, that can endure the disgrace of them, under
whose shelter they live. 2. Let us seek to draw others after us, from
<hi>Satan</hi> to Him. 3. Do we all we can, to promote his worship and
service. 4. Take we all good occasions to publish to others, how good
<hi>God</hi> is; and what he hath done for us. 5. Let us wholly ascribe
all the good we have, or do to free grace; and give him the glory
of his gifts, imploying them to our Masters best advantage, 6. Let
us (that we may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>presse our thankfulnesse to him) shew kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to his Children and poor <hi>members, who are bone of his bone, and
flesh of his flesh,</hi> Ephes. 5 30. 7. Abhor we our selves for our former
unthankfulnesse, and our wonderfull provoking of him. 8. Hearken
we unto <hi>Christs</hi> voice, in all that he saith unto us; and expresse our
thankfulnesse by our obedience. Yea, all this let us do, if we do it
but for our own sakes: For what should we have, if we did thus
serve <hi>Christ,</hi> who hath done all these things for his enemies neglecting
and dishonouring him?</p>
         </div>
         <div n="16" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. XVI.</head>
            <p>But thou wilt say, What can we do for <hi>God;</hi> or for <hi>Christ?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Answer, We cannot properly benefit <hi>God,</hi> nor add to his fulnesse.
They <hi>can add no good to him,</hi> that have <hi>all their good from him.</hi> The
Ocean is never the fuller, though all the <hi>rivers</hi> of the world, <hi>flow into
the</hi> same: So, What is <hi>God</hi> the better, for our praises or performances,
to whom (in that he is infinite) nothing can be added? <hi>If we be
righteous, our righteousnesse may profit the sonnes of men; but what can we
give unto him? or what receiveth he at our hands?</hi> Can the <hi>Sun</hi> receive
<hi>light</hi> from a <hi>candle?</hi> What profit does the <hi>Sunne</hi> receive, by our <hi>look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon it?</hi> We are <hi>the better</hi> for its <hi>light,</hi> not it for <hi>our sight;</hi> or at all
prejudiced by our neglect. <hi>A shower of rain</hi> that <hi>waters the earth,</hi> gets
nothing to it self: the <hi>earth</hi> fares the better for it. <hi>Lord</hi> (saith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid)
our well-doing doth not at all extend unto thee; but to the Saints that
are on the earth, and to the excellent ones in whom is all my delight,</hi> Psal. 16.
2, 3. Yea, if we could give him our <hi>bodies</hi> and <hi>souls,</hi> they should be
saved by it, but he were never the better for them. It is for our good,
that he would be served, and magnified of us.</p>
            <p>True, as the <hi>Ocean</hi> daynes to take <hi>tribute</hi> of the <hi>small brooks,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
that in token of thankfulnesse, which was its own before, it
being the <hi>maintainer of the rivers streams:</hi> Or as <hi>Joseph</hi> accepted of his
<hi>Brethrens</hi> small <hi>gifts,</hi> albeit he had no need of them, <hi>Gen</hi> 43 15. So
does <hi>God</hi> accept of our <hi>free-will offerings,</hi> and bountifully rewards
them, <hi>Phil: 4. 18.</hi> Yea, if in imploying our <hi>Talents,</hi> we aim at <hi>his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
and the <hi>Churches good,</hi> he doubles them, <hi>Matth. 25. 21, 22, 23.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor does <hi>God</hi> look for such <hi>glory,</hi> or <hi>service</hi> from us, as he is <hi>worthy
to receive,</hi> but as we are <hi>able to give.</hi> Our praises and performances,
are not sinnes; yet they are not without some touch of sin. Duties
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56896:16"/>
and infirmities, come from us together: but <hi>Christ</hi> parts them, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
the infirmities, and receiving the praises and performances.
They are full of weaknesses, yet does not he except against them for
their imperfections. He takes them well in worth, though there be
no worth in them: and vouehsafes them a reward, which had been
sufficiently honoured with a pardon.</p>
            <p>Neither can we hurt, or take away any thing from him: For <hi>if we
be wicked, our wickednesse may hurt a man like our selves; but what is it
to him,</hi> Job 35. 7, 8. Yet neverthelesse, we may do many things,
which he accounts and rewards, as done to himself; of which I will
give you one in special, and I pray mind it.</p>
            <p>Though we can do nothing for <hi>Christ himself,</hi> he being now in <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi>
yet we may do much for <hi>his poor members, those excellent ones
whom David</hi> speakes of <hi>Psalm 16. 2, 3.</hi> which <hi>Christ</hi> accounts all one,
as if it were done to himself, as appears by many expresse testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.
<hi>When I was an hungred, ye fed me; when I was naked, ye cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me; when sick and in prison, ye visited me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For in as much as ye did
it unto one of these little ones, that believe in me, ye did it unto me,</hi> Matth.
25. 34. to 41. <hi>He that giveth unto the poor, tendeth unto the Lord,</hi> Prov.
19. 17. And many the like which I have formerly cited.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="17" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. XVII.</head>
            <p>Now, do we love <hi>Christ?</hi> or would we indeed expresse our thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
<hi>to him,</hi> for what we have received <hi>from him?</hi> Or do we desire
to do something again for <hi>Christ,</hi> who hath done and suffered so much
for us? here is a way chalked out unto us, which he <hi>prefers before all
burnt-offerings and sacrifices,</hi> Mark. 12. 33. When <hi>David</hi> could do the
<hi>Father Barzillay</hi> no good, by reason of his old age: he loved, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
<hi>Chimham</hi> his <hi>son, 2 Sam. 19. 38.</hi> And to requite the love of
<hi>Jonathan,</hi> he shewed kindnesse to <hi>Mephibosheth.</hi> So if thou bearest
any good will to <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>Christ,</hi> whom it is not in thy power to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;
thou wilt shew thy thankfulnesse to him, in his <hi>Children</hi> and
poor <hi>members: who are bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh,</hi> Ephes. 5. 30.
Is our <hi>Jonathan</hi> gone? yet we have many <hi>Mephibosheths:</hi> and he that
<hi>loves God</hi> for his <hi>own sake,</hi> will <hi>love his Brother</hi> for <hi>Gods sake.</hi> Especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
when he hath loved us (as it were) on this condition, that we
should love one another, <hi>John 15. This is my Commandement,</hi> (saies
<hi>Christ) that ye love one another, as I have loved you,</hi> Vers. 12. <hi>And
greater love than his was, cannot be,</hi> Vers. 13. And untill we consider,
how infinitely good <hi>God</hi> hath been unto us: we can never shew any
goodnesse towards our Brethren. We must know, he hath given us
all we have: before we will part with any thing for his sake.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>God</hi> in the beginning, had no sooner <hi>created the Heavens and the
Earth,</hi> but he said, <hi>Let the Earth bring forth grass, the Herb yeelding
seed, and the fruitfull tree yeelding fruit,</hi> &amp;c <hi>Gen. 1. 11, 12.</hi> So when he
hath by his <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> created us anew, he commands us to be
fruitfull in the works of Piety, and Charity, <hi>Col. 1. 10.</hi> And the <hi>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of Charity,</hi> does alwaies <hi>spring, from the fountain of Piety. Faith</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:56896:17"/>
is as <hi>the leads,</hi> and <hi>pipes, to bring in:</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> is as <hi>the cock of the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit,
to let out.</hi> And what availeth the one without the other?
<hi>What avileth it, my Brethren,</hi> (saies S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

                  </gap> man saith he

and sill your bellies; notwithstanding ye give them not those things, which
are needfull for the body: what helpeth it? Even so the faith, if it have
no works, is dead in it self,</hi> James 2. 14. to 18. <hi>A just man lives by his

and undefiled before God, even the Father, is this: to visit the father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
and widdowes in their adversity, and to keep himself unspotted of the
world,</hi> James 1. 27. <hi>Love is the fulfilling of the Law,</hi> Rom. 13. 10. and
<hi>Faith is the fulfilling of the Gospel,</hi> Act. 13. 39. &amp; 16. 31. 1 Thes. 4. 14.

<hi>Faith</hi> is the <hi>mother grace: by it we are justified,</hi> Luke 7. 47, 50. Gal. 3. 8.
<hi>our hearts</hi> are <hi>purified,</hi> Act. 15. 9. <hi>our persons are accepted,</hi> and <hi>our soules
saved,</hi> Ephe. 2. 8, 9. Luke 18. 42. Yet in many respects, love is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
before it: as <hi>1 Cor. 13. 13. Now abideth Faith, Hope, and Love, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
these three; but the chiefest of these is Love.</hi> So that what the <hi>dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
is among <hi>stones,</hi> the <hi>Sun</hi> among <hi>Planets,</hi> and <hi>gold</hi> among <hi>mettals,</hi>
such is <hi>Love among the graces.</hi> Love will make us to have publique spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
resembling <hi>the Moon,</hi> which <hi>borroweth her light</hi> from the <hi>Sun,</hi> that
she may <hi>convey it to all the inferiour creatures; takes from the Sea,</hi>
that she may <hi>give to the lesser rivers.</hi> It will inforce us to practice,
what the <hi>Apostle</hi> exhorts unto, <hi>Phil. 2. Look not every man on his own
things, but every man also of the things of other men: let the same mind be
in you, that was even in Christ Jesus,</hi> &amp;c. Vers. 4, 5, 6. It will make us <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
them that are bound, as if we were bound with them, and them that
are in affliction, as if we were also afflicted in the body,</hi> Heb. 13 3. Which
is but reason. As maist not thou thy self be in affliction or want? and
wouldest not thou in thy need, be relieved? Why then shouldest not
thou know it reason, to do to others, as thou wouldest have them do
to thee? We ought to <hi>love our neighbour as our selves,</hi> Levit. 19. 18.
but how do we so, if we take not care for them, as we do for our
selves? There is nothing that any one doth, or indureth, but any other
may: We are all lyable to the same common misery, if unsustained.
Therefore insult not over him that is cast down; but let it make thee
humble, thankfull and compassionate: because it is a goodnesse not
our own, that makes the difference, though pride will scarce believe
it. The proudest he cannot say, this or that shall never befall me.
Who can say (saies <hi>Menander</hi>) I shall never do, nor suffer this or
that? For that we go not the round of others sinnes, or punishments,
it is neither our <hi>goodnesse, desert, policy,</hi> or <hi>power</hi> preventing, but from
those lines of gracious Providence, from <hi>Gods preventing,</hi> and <hi>preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi>
mercy. Doubtlesse he had been counted a prating fool, that
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56896:17"/>
should have told <hi>Haman,</hi> he should have held <hi>Mordecai's</hi> stirrup: much
lesse have changed preferment with him. That <hi>Mordecai</hi> should be
lifted up into <hi>Hamans</hi> favour at <hi>Court,</hi> and <hi>Haman</hi> should be exalted
to that fifty cubits eminency above ground, in <hi>Mordecais</hi> room. But
go we on.</p>
            <p>Love will cause us to open our hands unto such as are in want; and
lend or give them sufficient for their need, as <hi>God</hi> commands, <hi>Deut. 15.
8.</hi> It will make us of <hi>Jobs</hi> spirit, who <hi>would not eate his morsells alone,
but invited the fatherlesse to eate with him,</hi> Job 31. 17. It will make a
man <hi>love his enemies, and do good for them, that do hurt to him,</hi> Luke 6.
35. Yea, if need so require, as in a <hi>femine, or common persecution;</hi> it
will make us <hi>sell our possessions and goods, and distribute them to all, as
every one hath need,</hi> as did the <hi>Christians</hi> in the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> Acts
2. 44, 45. And lastly, which is above all; It will make a man to <hi>lay
downe his life for the brethren,</hi> 1 John 3. 16. Whereas he that hath not
this Christian grace, feels, and is sensible of common calamities, just
so much as appertains to his own private estate &amp; interest, and no more.
It is the <hi>want of compassion,</hi> that takes <hi>no compassion of others wants.</hi> Yea,
this is an argument, that <hi>the love of God is not in us,</hi> 1 John 3. 17. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
we thinke, or say, it is not at all in us, <hi>John 3. 14, 15. 17.</hi>

            <p>Nor can there be a better signe of true love, and sound amendment,

            <p>But to drive home this duty to mens consciences, see further what
cause we have to extend our liberality to the relief of Christs poore
members; For here I shall take occasion to slide into a discourse,
which in the <hi>Title page</hi> I durst not once mention, as well knowing how
averse most men are, and how desperately most rich mens hearts are
hardned against the poore; whereof ile onely give you an instance.</p>
            <p>Some <hi>six years since,</hi> having taken no small paynes in composing the
<hi>Poores Advocate in eight parts, I printed the first two of them</hi> with these
words in the front; <hi>That it is an incomparable favour to the rich, that
there are poore to accept of their Charity, had they the Wit to know it.</hi>
This they no sooner read but their bloods would rise, saying; We must
be beholding to the poore to accept of our charity, wee'l see them
hanged first. An expression more fit for <hi>a Caniball,</hi> then <hi>a Christian:</hi>
And certainly such men had need to look to it in time: for of all men
in the world, <hi>they shall have judgement without mercy, that are so</hi> misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<hi>unmercifull.</hi> And I would wish them, to take heed of turning the
deaf ear to <hi>Christ,</hi> when in his members he cryes to them for mercy:
lest <hi>Christ</hi> turnes the deaf ear to them, when they (being in far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
need) shall cry to him for mercy.</p>
            <p>Again, (which is worth the observing) when the said two parts
took so with the good, that provision was made, &amp; a way thought upon
that to every rich man in the Nation, there should be one of them,
freely given for the poores good, by the <hi>Clarkes of every Parish,</hi> they (I
mean some of them) so abused their trust, that the donor was forced
to withdraw his hand: whereby both <hi>Rich and Poore,</hi> might sustain
no little loss, the one in <hi>their souls,</hi> the other in <hi>their purses.</hi> For it is
well known that <hi>a person of quality</hi> upon the reading of it, sent in many
hundred pounds to the out parishes, to he be bestowed by the <hi>Church-Wardens</hi>
upon their poore. If any shall think I wrong <hi>Parish Clarkes,</hi>
let them but ask <hi>the Clark of Lawrence Church,</hi> whether the then <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
Pastour,</hi> did not deliver him <hi>five and fifty</hi> of those <hi>Bookes,
with the names of five and fifty rich men in that parish,</hi> together with a
great charge to deliver them into every of their hands. And whether
he did not most <hi>perfidiously and sacrilegiously</hi> barter them away to the
<hi>Booke Women</hi> for other <hi>Bookes,</hi> instead of giving them to the parties.
And this (for ile mention no more) I acquaint the world with, as
tendring the good of <hi>his soul,</hi> more then that of <hi>his honour,</hi> for I have
done in private what lies in me, to make him sensible of the crime, but
he is the more obstinate.</p>
            <p>Now that I have taken occasion to shrowd the <hi>Remaines of the poores
Advocate,</hi> under the notion of <hi>how to become happy here and hereafter,</hi>
these are my reasons.</p>
            <p>First, Bounty to the poore, is the most proper meanes, tending to
happiness. And secondly, it is very probable, that many will read or hear
thus far, under this notion (whether out of curiosity or self ends) and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56896:19"/>
having heard hitherto, will be willing also to hear me a few words in
behalf of the poore, (which is of no less concernment) when other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
they would have heard neither of both. Now such as have read
the two first parts of The Poores Advocate, may remember, that I have
dispatched <hi>these six heads. 1. The necessity of the duty. 2. The persons
of whom it is required. 3. They to whom it must be performed. 4. VVhat.
5. How. 6. How much we are to give.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the other six parts, I intended to have treated, 1. <hi>Of the time
when we are to give. 2. Of the meanes inabling to it. 3. Of the ends to be
propounded in it. 4. Of the impediments that hinder it. 5. Of the remedies
or incouragements. And 6. Of the Vses.</hi> But finding that it would have
been as welcome to the parties concerned therein, as <hi>water</hi> into a <hi>ship,</hi>
I will onely give you a few gleanings out of them: In which also I will
more respect the weight and benefit of the matter, then the order of
handling: that so I may couch all, within a little compass.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="21" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. XXI.</head>
            <p>Touching the <hi>grounds, reasons,</hi> and <hi>inducements,</hi> which may move men
to be bountifull and beneficent to the poore, with which I will begin:
they are so many, that onely to name them all, would by worldlings
be thought too much. Wherefore I will onely nominate such, as every
wise man (even out of self love) will allow for weighty. And therein
be as brief as possibly I can in running them over.</p>
            <p>1. If in some good measure we perform this duty, if we <hi>deal our bread
to the hungry, bring the poore that are cast out into our houses; and that see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them naked, we cover them,</hi> as it is <hi>I say 58. 7. God hath promised</hi> and
given it under his hand, <hi>that it shall go well with us in our estates, and that
we shall be no loosers by it, but he will surely pay it us again, Ecc. 11. 1. Luke
6. 38. Matth. 6. 4.</hi> And lest any should be discouraged, from performing
these duties, because he is able to give but a little: he assureth us, that
<hi>whosoever giveth a cup of cold water unto a Disciple in the name of a Disciple
he shall in no wise lose his reward,</hi> Matt. 10. 42. And that because this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
is not grounded upon the excellency and merit of the work, but
upon <hi>Gods rightousness and truth,</hi> in fulfilling his promises, according to
that <hi>Heb. 6. 10. For God is not unrighteous, that he should forget your work,
and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have
minstred to the Saints, and do minister;</hi> Whereby he implyeth that it is
no more possible, that those who in love and obedience, have exercised
themselves in these works of mercy, should lose their reward, then
that <hi>God</hi> himself should lose his righteousness. <hi>And the wise man</hi> tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
us, that <hi>he who hath pitty on the poore, lendeth unto the Lord, and that
which he hath given, he will repay again, Prov. 19. 17.</hi> Neither in reason
can it be otherwise, for if mercy and bounty be in <hi>God,</hi> as an inexhan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stible
&amp; everspringing <hi>fountain,</hi> and in us as a <hi>little stream</hi> that floweth
from it, how is it possible that our small and shallow rivulets of mercy
should flow to our Neighbours, and that the everlasting spring of
<hi>Gods</hi> mercy and goodness should be dry unto us? or how should <hi>the
stream flow and the fountain and well head be dried up?</hi> Yea let us assure
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56896:19"/>
our selves, that we cannot suffer (in a wise and dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>reet manner) emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
our selves of these waters of <hi>Gods</hi> blessings, for the satisfying and
quenching of the poore mans thirst, and relieving of his wants: but we
shall again be replenished from the fountain of all goodness; and if like
<hi>kind Nurses,</hi> we let these deare <hi>Children of God suck the breasts of our
bounty, for their comfort and nourishment:</hi> that which is thus spent will
again be restored: whereas if we churlishly refuse to impart, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
this <hi>milk of Gods blessings,</hi> it is the readiest way to have it quite
<hi>dried up.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither are we to imagine that if we be carefull in feeding <hi>Christ,</hi>
that he will be carelesse in feeding us. That he will deny us meate
who hath given us his precious blood. That he will suffer us to want
<hi>earthly trifles,</hi> who hath provided for us <hi>heavenly ricbes.</hi> Let such
more then heathenish diffidence, be farre from us, who professe our
selves to be of the houshold of Faith. Is it not <hi>he</hi> (as <hi>Hannah</hi> speaketh)
that <hi>maketh poore, and maketh rich;</hi> that <hi>bringeth low, and lifteth up.</hi>
Do we enjoy all things through <hi>Gods</hi> blessing? And can we thinke to
keep our riches, by disobeying his commandment? Indeed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
we may well expect, according to that, <hi>Prov. 11. There is that
scattereth, and is more increased; but he that spareth more then is right,
shall surely come to poverty,</hi> vers. 24. And it is but just, if <hi>God deny</hi>
thee thy <hi>daily bread,</hi> if thou <hi>denyest him the crumbs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus it appeareth, that by giving to the poor, we shall be no
loosers. But this is not all; For</p>

         <div n="22" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. XXII.</head>
            <p>Secondly, we shall not onely receive our own again, but it shall be
with great increase. Yea, if the <hi>Word of God</hi> be true, there is not a
more compendious way to thrive and grow rich, then by being boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
to the poore: But that bounty is the best and surest way to ple<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and that it is so far from weakning a mans estate, or bringing him
to want and poverty, that it is the onely meanes to keep us from it,
and to bring plenty and abundance. I have largely and plentifully
proved (if you remember) in Chapter the 30. of <hi>The best and surest way
to become rich:</hi> And I heartily wish, that the Reader would peruse
the same: For it is the most piercing and patheticall Chapter of all the
parts, and should methinks exceedingly wheron those that are greedy
of gaine, to put the same into practice, and make them bountifull in
doing these workes of mercy, and not think themselves loosers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by;
but rather to conclude as a mercifull man once did; <hi>The more I
give, the more I have.</hi> As what <hi>Husbandman</hi> does not reckon more of
his <hi>seed in the ground,</hi> then of that <hi>in his Barn or Garner?</hi> And shall we
be such <hi>Atheists,</hi> as to trust the ground, and not <hi>God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, let us be so far from grudging these Almes to the poor, when
we have fit occasion, that we do them with joy and thankfulnesse un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>God,</hi> that he hath given us so fit an opportunity of sowing our seed,
that so we may reap a fruitfull harvest. For what <hi>husbandman</hi> would
not readily and cheerfully hearken to one, who should offer him <hi>fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56896:20"/>
and fruitfull land,</hi> ready <hi>prepared,</hi> and <hi>ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ured,</hi> to <hi>sow his seed in,</hi>
with a faithful promise, that he should <hi>reape</hi> the whole <hi>crop</hi> for his own
use, and benefit? But thus <hi>God</hi> dealeth with us, when he giveth us op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of relieving the poor: Yea, in truth much better and more
ability, for he gives us even the seed also we sow with; and whereas,
if a man should freely receive of another, Land to sow his seed in, yet
he were not sure of a fruitfull harvest: For many accidents usually hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
which cut off the hopes of the most skilfull Husbandman, as
<hi>Frosts,</hi> and <hi>Mildewes, wormes</hi> and <hi>locusts, tares</hi> and <hi>weeds,</hi> too much
<hi>wet,</hi> or too much <hi>drought</hi> may <hi>destroy the corn,</hi> though the seed were
never so good: or when it is <hi>ready for the sickle,</hi> the <hi>enemy</hi> may come
and <hi>reap it;</hi> but if we sow these seeds of our beneficence, believing
<hi>Gods</hi> promises, and hoping for a happy harvest: we shall never sail of
our expectation, because <hi>God</hi> who is infinite in power and truth, having
promised a fruitfull <hi>crop,</hi> no outward accident is able to hinder it.</p>
            <p>But lest what hath been said should not be sufficient to prevail with
men to be mercifull to the poore, let them hearken to, and mind well
the many <hi>other reasons and inducements</hi> that propound themselves, and
then I doubt not, but they will if wise, <hi>do good to others,</hi> if it be but <hi>to do
a greater good to themselves.</hi> For of all other graces, the grace of <hi>charity
and bounty, hath the most and primest promises of reward, to us and ours, both
here and hereafter,</hi> of which I will mention some.</p>

            <p>Thirdly, <hi>God</hi> hath further promised to confirm, strengthen, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue,
as well as increase his prosperous and flourishing estate, and that
in sundry places of scripture already cited and elsewhere. <hi>He is graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and full of compassion, he sheweth favour and lendeth, he hath given to
the poore, &amp;c.</hi> And what shall be his reward? <hi>Wealth and Riches shall be
in his house, he shall not be moved for ever: his righteousness</hi> (aye and his
riches too, as is implied in the close) <hi>shall endure for ever, he shall be in
everlasting remembrance, he shall not be afraid of evill tidings, his heart is
fixed trusting in the Lord, his horn shall be exalted with honour, Psal. 112. 1.
to 10. All grace shall abound towards him, that he always having al sufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy

32. 8. He drawes out his soul to the hungry, and comforteth the afflicted:
therefore his light shall rise in obscurity, and his darkness shall be as the noon
day; and the Lord shall guide him continually, and satisfie his soul in draught,
and make fat his bones, he shall be like a watered garden, and like a spring
of water whose waters fail not: and they that shall be of him, shall build the

                  </gap> have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread:</hi> and
why so? <hi>He is ever merciful and lendeth, and his seed is blessed,</hi> as it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
in the next verse, and in the next to that; <hi>He that does good shall

which are all pregnant places, and full to the point in hand. But I
may not stand upon it; Onely read these Scriptures and remember
them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, he shall be blessed in his person, and that many waies:
yea the benefits and <hi>blessings, temporall, spirituall, and corporall, for soul
and body,</hi> which God hath promised to bestow upon the mercifull, for a
reward of their bounty, are infinite, of which observe with me these
few.</p>
            <p>First, touching <hi>corporall benefits</hi> and blessings. <hi>Blessed is the saith the
Psalmist, that considereth the poore, the Lord shall deliver him in the time of
trouble, he will keep and preserve him alive, he shall be blessed upon the earth,
and not delivered unto the will of his enemies, Psalm 41. 1, 2, 3.</hi> Great pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges!
but to these are added, <hi>Isa. 58. If thou draw out thy soul to the
hungry, then shall thy health spring forth speedily, &amp;c.</hi> verse 7. 8. But ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the mercifull man be long sick, <hi>God will preserve him alive, strengthen
him upon the bed of languishing; yea make all his bed in his sickness, the
Lord will stir up the feathers under him, his soul shall be at ease, and his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
sweetly refreshed, mercy shall be his cordiall or pillow of repose, untill he
be raised up again, Psalm 41. 1. to</hi> 11.</p>

            <p>But see how <hi>God</hi> hath rewarded many <hi>particular persons</hi> for this most
excellent vertue. <hi>Abraham</hi> in his old age was blessed with an <hi>Isaac,</hi>
a godly son and heir, a glorious <hi>type of the worlds Redeemer,</hi> and <hi>enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
Angels</hi> by his hospitality: yea the <hi>Son of God, the Lord of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi>
as <hi>Sinesius</hi> observes. <hi>The Shunam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Elisha, received above a Prophets reward;</hi> namely the promise and gift
of a son when she was old, and the raising of him to life when he was
dead, and the restoring of her house and land, lost in her long absence
for the samine, <hi>2 Kings</hi> 4 and 8. Chapters. <hi>Rebeccah</hi> got so good and
great an Husband by her hospitality, as <hi>Chrysostom</hi> observes. <hi>Lot</hi> was
honoured <hi>with the entertainment of Angels,</hi> and preserved alive with his
whole family from the <hi>destruction of Sodom</hi> by his hospitality. The <hi>Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ow
of Sarepta</hi> was blessed with a miraculous <hi>increase of her meal and oyl,</hi>
with the preservation of her family in the time of famine; &amp; with the
resurrection of her son, by her relieving the <hi>Prophet</hi> in his banishment,
<hi>1 Kings 17. Revell</hi> or <hi>Jethro</hi> (for it is the same man under two divers
names) as <hi>Calvin</hi> proves upon <hi>Exod. 2.</hi> for this, was rewarded with
such a son in law as <hi>Moses,</hi> and by him better instructed in the true
worship of <hi>God. Publius the chief man of the Island Melita,</hi> by enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
<hi>St Paul</hi> and his companions gat <hi>his father healed of a feaver,

               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:56896:21"/>

or do:</hi> And we know that the blessing of <hi>God</hi> in effect is all, and does
all, <hi>Thou shalt surely give to thy poore Brother, and thy heart shall not
be grieved when thou givest unto him: because for this thing, the Lord thy God
shall blesse thee in all thy work, and in all that thou puttest thine hand to,</hi>
Deut. 15. 10. And the like <hi>Prov. 22. 9. Luke 14. 14.</hi> It were endless to
name the particulars, wherein <hi>God</hi> hath promised to bless the merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,

10. Deut. 14 28, 29. Ezek. 44. 30.</hi> Or turn to <hi>Luke 11.</hi> and there you

         <div n="25" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. XXV.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly, the mercifull man shall be no less</hi> blessed in his name and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
he shall be had in honour and reputation: <hi>according to that</hi> Prov. 14.
He that oppresseth the poore, reproacheth him that made him; but he honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
him that hath mercy upon the poore, <hi>ver. 31. And to this accords that
of the Psalmist,</hi> he hath dispersed, he hath given to the poore, his righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
endureth for ever his horn shall be exalted with honour, <hi>Psalm 112. 9.
And so</hi> Proverbs 10. His memoriall shall be blessed, <hi>Verse 7.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And of this I might give you sundry examples, and preg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>t. As
<hi>Rachab, Gaius, Job, The Centurian, Boas, Cornelius,</hi> and <hi>Mery:</hi> as how
did <hi>our Saviour</hi> value and honour <hi>Maries</hi> bounty? (though so slighted by
<hi>him that was a thief, and carried the bag,</hi> into which he would have had
it come) when he <hi>commanded it should be spoken of to her honour, wherefo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the Gospell should be preached throughout all the world, Matth. 26. 13,</hi>
But <hi>experience</hi> sufficiently proves, that a liberal and bountiful man, shall
have all love and respect with men, all good repute and report, both li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
and dead: Nor is this so light a blessing as many deeme it, for
what sayes the <hi>wise man? The memoriall of the just shall be blessed: but
the name of the wicked shall rot, Prov. 10. 7. Tea a good name, is better then
a sweet oyntment: and to be chosen before great riches, Prov. 22. 1.</hi> yea, then
life it self.</p>
            <p>Briefly, for conclusion of this point, let this be <hi>the use:</hi> when the poore
at your gates ask their daily bread, they highly honour you, yea after a
sort they make you Gods: therefore by your bounty &amp; liberality, shew
your selves at least to be <hi>Christians,</hi> to be <hi>men.</hi> Secondly, such as have
by this divine vertue obtained a good report: let it provoke them as
much to excell others in doing good, as they do excell them in hearing
thereof. For I hold this a sure rule, He is of a bad nature to whom
good report and commendations are no spur to vertue, but he is of a
worse disposition, to whom evil report and blame, is no bridle and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive
from vice, which made <hi>Tully</hi> so wonder at the strange perverse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of <hi>Antony:</hi> whom <hi>neither praise could allure</hi> to do well, <hi>nor yet
fear of infamy</hi> and reproach <hi>deter</hi> from committing evil. But,</p>
         </div>
         <div n="26" type="chapter">
            <pb n="39" facs="tcp:56896:21"/>
            <head>CHAP. XXVI.</head>
            <p>Seaventhly, the <hi>spiritual blessings</hi> and benefits which accompany
these works of mercy, and thereby accrew to the soul even in this lifes
as they are inestimable, so they are innumerable, lie nominate so many
as may satisfie, and not cloy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First, it is the onely meanes to have the soul prosper, kept safe and
preserved,</hi> Psal. 36. Preserve my soul (<hi>saith</hi> David) for I am mercifull,
<hi>Verse. 2.</hi> The liberall soul shall be made fat, and he that watereth shall also
be watred himself, Prov. 11. 25. The mercifull man doth good to his own
soul, <hi>Verse 17.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, it is rewarded with <hi>illumination and conversion, The two
Disciples that went to Emaus,</hi> were rewarded with illumination, for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining
<hi>our Saviour</hi> as a stranger, <hi>Luke 24. 45.</hi> Whence <hi>St. Austin</hi>
observes, that by the duty of Hospitality, we come to the knowledge
of Christ. <hi>Loe saith St. Gregory, the Lord was not known while he spake,
and he vouchsafes to be known while he is fed.</hi> And then <hi>St. Albo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e</hi> the
first <hi>Martyre,</hi> that ever in <hi>England</hi> suffered death for the name of <hi>Christ,</hi>
was <hi>converted from Paganism to Christienity by a certain Clark, whom he
had received into his house, fleeing from the persecutors hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, works of mercy are infallible <hi>signes of a lively faith;</hi>
whereby we may prove it to our selves, and approve it unto men. <hi>Jam.
2. 18.</hi> which fruits, if our faith beare not, it is dead, &amp; not a living body,
but a carcass that breatheth not, verse 26. They are signes of a lively
faith, for no man easily parteth wirh his worldly goods to these uses,
unless by faith he be assured that he shall have in lieu of them heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liy
and everlasting treasures. The merciful man is ever a faithfull man.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, it testifies our unfeigned <hi>repentance,</hi> whereof it is that
<hi>Daniel</hi> saith to <hi>Me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>usba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nezer; Wherefore O King, break off thy sins by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
and thine iniquities, by shewing mercy unto the poore,</hi> Dan. 4: 27.
The which <hi>Zache<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi> practised, <hi>Luke 19.</hi> For no sooner was he converted
unto <hi>God,</hi> but to testifie his unfeigned repentance, he <hi>giveth half his
goods unto the poore,</hi> Verse 8.</p>
            <p>Fifthly giving much, is an infallible signe that many sins are forgiven
us: as our <hi>Saviour</hi> speaketh of <hi>the woman, Luke 7. 47.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, by it we may know our selves to be the children of God
1 John 3. 14. Yea and others may also know it, <hi>John 13. 34, 35.</hi> And
hereby <hi>we know the unmercifull to be none of Gods children:</hi> for the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
of <hi>Mercies</hi> hath no <hi>children</hi> but the <hi>mercifull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly, it is said that</hi> Obadia feared God greatly: for when Iesabel
destroied the Prophets of the Lord, he took an hundred Prophets and bid them
by fifty in a cave, and he fed them with bread and water, 1 Kings 28. 3. 4.
<hi>Therefore it is a sure signe of the fear of</hi> God.</p>
            <p>Eightly, they are undoubted <hi>fignes of our love towards God.</hi> When as
we so love the poore for his sake, as that we be content to spare some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what,
even from our own backs and bellies, that we may the more
liberally communicate unto their necessities. But this a wicked man
will never do the onely loves the Lord <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

riches by him; Or as <hi>Soul</hi> loved <hi>Samuel,</hi> to gain honour by him. True
they will say they love <hi>God,</hi> and perhaps think so too: but let them
say what they will, if unmercifull, I will never believe against Scripture,
that they <hi>love God whom they have not seen: that love not their brother
whom they have seen; if we love him, we will love one another, 1 John
4, 20, 11. If any man</hi> (saies the <hi>Apostle</hi>) <hi>have these worlds goods, and seeth
his Brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him,
how dwelleth the love of God in him? 1 John 3. 17.</hi> And us they are
manifest signes of our love to <hi>God,</hi> so also of our love towards our
Neighbours: when as we carry our selves in all Christian bounty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them, as unto <hi>Children of the same Father, and members of the
same body: suffering with them in their wants;</hi> through compassion
and sellow-feeling, <hi>and rejoycing with them in their fulness</hi> and prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
<hi>Hereby we know that we love the brethren: because our hearts and hands
are open to them,</hi> for love is bountifull. For otherwise it is but an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable,
counterfeit, and hypocriticall love, to make shew of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and compassion in word, and to perform nothing in deed; as <hi>Saint
James</hi> plainly affirmeth, <hi>James 2: 15.</hi> But that this alone is the best
touchstone, to shew the sincerity and truth of our love; many places
demonstrate, as <hi>2 Cor. 8. 8, 24. 1 John 3. 18.</hi>
            </p>
         </div>
         <div n="27" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. XXVII.</head>
            <p>And as our Almesdeeds are a sign of our love to <hi>God</hi> and our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour:
so the quantity of our almes, (respect being had to the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our estate) is a signe of the quantity of our love, for he loveth
but little, that having much, giveth but a little; and contrariwise, his
heart is inflamed with fervent love, who hath it inflamed with bounty
towards his poore brethren: the extension of our love towards them,
being the true touchstone of the intention of our love towards <hi>God.</hi>
And as a <hi>great tree</hi> with many and large <hi>branches,</hi> is an undoubted sign
of a <hi>root proportionable</hi> in greatness: and <hi>a small shrub</hi> above the ground,
plainly sheweth that the <hi>root</hi> also is <hi>small</hi> wch is under it: so is it with
our Almesdeeds which spring from it. For if we be <hi>bountiful in Almes,</hi>
we are <hi>plentifull in love;</hi> If we be <hi>slack in giving,</hi> we are <hi>cold in loving:</hi>
but if we be utterly defective, in bringing forth these excellent fruits,
then it is a manifest sign that this grace of love is not rooted, in us,
<hi>1 John 3. 17.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ninthly, It is an evident demonstration that we have</hi> saving knowledge
<hi>and</hi> spiritual wisdom: for the wisdom that is from above, is full of mercy
and good fruits, James 3. 17. <hi>Otherwise we are not wise, our</hi> wisdom
descends not from above, but is earthly, sensuall, and devillish, <hi>Verse. 15.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tenthly, By these works of mercy, we make our <hi>calling and election
sure, for if we do these things we shall never fall as St. Peter</hi> speak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, a Pet.
1. 7, 8, 10. And <hi>St. Paul</hi> infers, <hi>Col. 3. Put on as the elect of God, holy
and beloved, the bowels of mercy and kindness,</hi> Verse 12. Which makes
him in another place call charity a never sailing grace. <hi>1 Cor. 1. 8.</hi>
And a little after, he useth these words; <hi>Now abideth, Faith, Hope, and
Charity, these three, but the greatest of these is Cherity, Verse 13.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:56896:22"/>
Eleventhly, This is a duty which undoubtedly must justifie the
truth of our religion, or else condemn us as hollow hearted, and swayed
by hyp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>crisie, <hi>James 1. This is pure religion, and undesiled before God,
to visat the father less and widow in their affliction,</hi> Verse 27. O that this
lesson would enter home into every one of our hearts, before we go
out of our houses. For men may cry up this side, and cry down that,
but of all the three, the <hi>Priest,</hi> the <hi>Levite,</hi> and the <hi>Samaritan;</hi> none but

            </p>
            <p>And indeed <hi>God</hi> so highly prizeth, and esteemeth mercy and the
works where in it is exercised towards the poore: that he preferteth
them before the outward acts of relig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Finally these <hi>works of mercy, are not onely anodor of a sweet smell, and
a sacrifice acceptable and well pleasing to God:</hi> (as the <hi>Apostle</hi> speaks, <hi>Phil.
4. 18.</hi>) But also such an oblation, as if we offer unto <hi>God</hi> with a lively
faith, the use of all the creatures shall be clean unto us: according
to that of <hi>our Saviour, Luke 11. 41.</hi> See more <hi>Heb, 13. 16. Isa. 58. 6, 7, 8.
James 1. 27.</hi> And this is a Twelfth benefit.</p>

         <div n="28" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. XXVIII.</head>
            <p>Thirteenthly, another no small benefit that we have thereby is, by
our bounty towards the poor, we have the benefit of their prayers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>God,</hi> the which are very available, for the obtaining of all good things
for us, the which argument the <hi>Apostle</hi> useth to incite the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to
a <hi>liberal contribution, 2 Cor. 9, 11. to 15.</hi> insomuch that when we hold our
peace, or are sleeping in our beds, <hi>the loynes of the poore shall bless us,</hi> as
it is <hi>Job 31. 20. and 29. 12, 13.</hi> Whereas on the contrary, he that giveth
not to the poore, shall lie open to their curse, according to that <hi>Prov.</hi>
28, 27. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 15. 9, and 24, 15. the which curses of the poore, he will
hear and ratifie, according to that, <hi>Job</hi> 31. 16. to 29.</p>
            <p>Fourteenthly, By the same meanes also, we give them and others
<hi>occasion of praising, and glorifying God: whilest by the experiment of this
ministration, they see our professed subjection to the Gospel of Christ,</hi> as the
<hi>Apostle</hi> speaketh, 2 <hi>Cor. 9. 13.</hi> Wherefore let us strive to abound in this
duty, that whiles they injoy our hounty, we may injoy their prayers;
<hi>2 Tim. 1. 18.</hi> and <hi>God</hi> may have their praises, <hi>2 Cor 9. 15.</hi> And so much
the rather, for that of all men, seldom is any great sin, shame or punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
fastned on the charitable<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> for how should he speed ill that hath
the prayers of so many?</p>
            <p>Fifteenthly, it is no small pleasure, and joy which a <hi>Christian</hi>
taketh in performing these works of mercy; for first these vertuous
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56896:23"/>
actions in themselves, do even for the present fill their hearts with
joy, who rightly perform them. But much more do they fill our hearts
with joy, as they are evident signes to assure us, that we are indued
with <hi>Gods</hi> saving graces, and as they do, being fruits of a lively faith, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine
us of our future reward, and the fruition of <hi>Gods presence, where
there is fulnesse of joy for ever more.</hi> Yea the godly man, gives with more
joy and thankfulness of heart, then the other receives the same, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
can hear me witness; Yea <hi>Seneca</hi> an <hi>Heathen</hi> can testifie the
same: for he defines a benefit, to be an action proceeding from love,
yeilding joy both to him that receiveth it, and much more to him that
yeildeth it.</p>
            <p>Sixteenthly, The inward habit of goodness and mercy in our hearts,
exercised in the outward actions of liberality &amp; bounty by our hands,
makes us to resemble <hi>God</hi> himself; and that in such an attribute, as
he delightetls above all others to stile himself withall. For howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he is infinite in glory, power, and all perfections: yet most usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in the <hi>Scriptures, he is called a God of mercy and compossion,</hi> and
hereby principally, he maketh himself known unto <hi>Moses,</hi> desiring to see
him, <hi>Exod. 34. 6.</hi> Nor can we in any thing resemble <hi>God</hi> more, then
in this grace: and therefore it is our <hi>Saviours</hi> exhortation, that we be
<hi>mercifull, as our heavenly Father is mercifull,</hi> Luke 6. 36. Now <hi>God
gives to all richly to injoy, 1 Tim. 6. 17.</hi> Yea, <hi>blessed be God, saies the
Church, that daily ladeth us with benefits, that crowneth us with loving
kindness, and compasseth us about with new songs of deliverance, Psalm 103.
and 36</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore seeing mercy and goodness do make us above all other
graces to resemble <hi>God,</hi> and then the creature <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to greatest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
and blessednesse, when he is the likest, and cometh nearest un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
to the excellency of the <hi>Creator.</hi> And seeing we professe our selves to
be <hi>children of our</hi> gracious and glorious <hi>God:</hi> and we can no way grace
our selves so much, as by resembling our heavenly Father, in those
attributes wherein he most shineth and excelleth: and nothing
maketh us more like him, then mercy and compassion: let us hearken
unto our <hi>Saviours</hi> injunction, and <hi>imitate our Father in being beutifull
as he is.</hi> These are some of the spiritual blessings and benefits
which <hi>God</hi> hath promised for reward to the mercifull in this life: it
would take up too much time to mention the many more that might
be added; therefore I will leave them, and so procced to those that are
eternall, &amp; concern the life to come, which I would have you especially
mind: yea if it be possible, pluck up all your senses into your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ars, that
you may the more mind, and better remember; for it is enough to
ravish any <hi>Christian soul,</hi> and to make him to stretch his estate upon the
tenters, that he may be the more liberall, in relieving <hi>Christs poore mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers;
for the greater the liberality, the greater the recompence of reward,
Phil. 4. 17. 18.</hi>

set the sheep on his right hand, and the goats on the left; Then shall the
King say unto them on his right hand, come ye blessed of my Father, inherit
the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was

            <p>Almes is a seed <hi>which we</hi> cast into the earth <hi>as it were,</hi> but <hi>we</hi> gather
them crop in Heaven. <hi>Whence the Apostle would have</hi> Timothy <hi>to</hi> charge
them that are rich in this world, that they be not high minded, nor trust in
uncertain riches, but in the <hi>Lord:</hi> who giveth us richly all things to enjoy.
And that they do good, that they be rich in good workes, ready to distribute,
willing to communicate, laying up in store for themselves (mark his reason)
a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternall
life, 1 Tim. 6. 17, 18, 19. <hi>And hereupon it is, that he telleth the</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians,
<hi>he was</hi> glod that they had sent him a supply: <hi>not so much for his
own benefit, as for their gain, which should be great in the day of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,</hi>
Phil. 4. 14. 17, 18. <hi>And this makes</hi> Solomon <hi>say, that</hi> he who is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull
doth good to his own soul, <hi>Prov. 11. 17.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that to distribute to the poore on earth, is before hand to provide
a rich treasure in <hi>Heaven.</hi> And who then that believes this, would
not think himself happy in such an exchange? Is not this the best
Chimistry <hi>to turn Earth into Heaven?</hi> is not this a good bargaine to
part with vaine and uncertain things, to partake of real and durable
riches? Believe it, this is the best improvement, and the most that
can be made of these things: Whereupon <hi>St. Austin</hi> thus exhorts, <hi>Si vis

tempotalem possessionem, ut consequaris here ditalem aternan:</hi> Wouldest
thou be a good <hi>Merchant?</hi> a great <hi>Vsurer?</hi> give that thou canst not
keep, that thou maist receive that which cannot be lost: Give though
but a little, that thou maist receive a thousand sold, give thy earthly
goods, that thou maist obtain eternall life, though indeed <hi>this giving is
rather a receiving then a giving,</hi> a receiving of treasure for trash, and for
things that cannot be kept, a treasure that cannot be lost, as another hath
it: Nor do the poore so much gain by what we give them, as we do, The
deeds of the charitable, do far more profit the giver then the receiver,
and <hi>he who gives an almes doth himself a greater almes.</hi> Neither is it so
much given as laid up, for we may truly say, <hi>what I gave that I have, what
I kept that I lost,</hi> as one caused it to be set upon his gravestone. What
the charitable man gives here, is but sent, for he shall receive it again
by <hi>Bill of Exchange in Heaven,</hi> and that with unspeakable increase. Yea
it shall be a notable advantage to us at the <hi>hour of death:</hi> for when all
other riches shall fail, what we have bestowed this way, shall let us in to

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56896:24"/>
appointed Potters, to let their rich Benefactors into Heaven. So that
to give much, is to keep much; and that what would otherwise be
lost by keeping, the charitable man keeps by loosing, And so proves
richer under ground, then ever he was above it, which makes one

godly <hi>Chrysostome</hi> both <hi>affirmes and proves, that the rich are more behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the poore, then the poore to the rich.</hi> The poor receive onely a
single almes, the rich have returned them an hundred-fold here, and
everlasting happinesse hereafter, <hi>Mat. 5. 7. &amp; 25. 35. Luke 16. 9.</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

which see <hi>Cor. 9. 11. to 16. The poore</hi> are but the <hi>ground,</hi> into which
these <hi>seeds</hi> are cast: But we are the <hi>Husbandmen,</hi> who disperse and
scatter them. Now as the seed is chiefly for his benefit who soweth it,
and not for the benefit of the ground into which it is cast: so the poor
have but the present use and possession of this seed of almes-deed; but
the benefit of the crop or harvest, belongeth to those good Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
who sow in these grounds the seeds of their beneficence.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>the poor receive</hi> onely <hi>things transitory,</hi> and but <hi>of small <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </hi>
but <hi>they that give, things spirituall and eternall,</hi> most inestimable and
heavenly riches! Why say we then we give to the poor? when as it
may more truly be said, that <hi>we give unto our selves, rather then unto
them,</hi> Dan. 4. 27. Prov. 11. 24. Why then should we thinke the poor so
mightily bound and beholding unto us for our <hi>scrape and superfluius re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques;</hi>
or that we do such a meritorious businesse, whenwe largely
relieve them? And not rather thinke our selves beholding unto them
and to <hi>God</hi> for them, seeing they are the occasions of such inestima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
gaine, for such trifling disbursements; as <hi>Austine</hi> speaks.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:56896:25"/>
And to speak rightly, <hi>giving is not more an act of Charity then of
Christian policy:</hi> since we shall not onely receive our own again, but
have a far greater return then can be expected, upon an adventure to
the <hi>East Indies:</hi> Since we are more happy that there are poore upon
whom we may exercise our charity, then they are, that there are rich
who do relieve their wants though with never so great supply; for as
<hi>Austine</hi> speaks, if there were not some to receive thine alms, thou could<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
not give Earth and receive Heaven: Wherefore give thanks unto
him who hath given thee means by such a small prise, to procure a
thing so precious.</p>
            <p>Besides, we may boldly aver, with <hi>Chrysostom; that without poverty
riches would be unprofitable:</hi> As consider that if with <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> we
had a whole world, but no body to make ready provision and to attend
upon us, nor do any thing for us; what joy could great men take of their
riches, if there were not poore men to do mean offices for them, what

            <p>Thus I might go on, and inlarge my selfe upon this, and add there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto

onely give you the sum of some few particulars briefly, and leave the

            <p>That little which I intend to deliver is: First, the <hi>neer communion

58. 6, 7.</hi>) There are many <hi>spirituall respects, and divine relations</hi> which
make a more neer communion between <hi>Christians</hi> one with another:
for we are <hi>elected</hi> to the same <hi>eternall life</hi> and happinesse, we are not
onely <hi>Gods</hi> workmanship. <hi>created in Adam according to his owne glorious
image,</hi> but <hi>re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>created</hi> and restored unto the <hi>divine Image</hi> (lost by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>)
in <hi>Christ the second Adam: we are redeemed</hi> in our soules and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
<hi>with the same precious blood of Jesus Christ,</hi> we are <hi>partakers of
the same calling,</hi> whereby we are <hi>chosen out of the world,</hi> and <hi>gathered
into the Church and communion of Saints,</hi> that we may <hi>inherit eternall
glory together,</hi> and that <hi>out of darknesse into marvellous light, and out
of</hi> a desperate condition, to be partakers of the same precious promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
And by vertue of this Calling, we <hi>serve one and the same God, are
of one Church and family, and have one Religion, one faith, one baptisme,</hi>
are invited <hi>guests to the same Table and Supper of our Lord,</hi> are all <hi>Heirs
and Co-heires of the same heavenly kingdome,</hi> and therein annexed also
with <hi>Christ our elder brother.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, we <hi>are brethren of the same Father,</hi> the onely <hi>Spouse of the
same heavenly Bridegroom,</hi> and <hi>members of the same mystical body, whereof
Jesus Christ is the head;</hi> so that the neerest, and strongest communion
that can be imagined, is between <hi>Christians</hi> one with another, and all
of them with their head <hi>Jesus Christ:</hi> And should not all this move us
to relieve them? Yea, more then all this, If <hi>we do good to</hi> our fellow-members,
the benefit will redound unto <hi>our selves,</hi> who are of the
same body; even <hi>as the hand giving nourishment to the mouth, and the
mouth preparing it for the stomacke, do in nourishing it provide nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for themselves also.</hi> Yea more then all this, there is such a neare
and strong union and communion with the poor, together with us,
and with our head <hi>Christ our Saviour:</hi> That he <hi>esteem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> as done to
himselfe which is done unto them; even as the head acknowledgeth the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
done unto it, which the meanest member of the body receiveth.</hi> Yea,
in truth, that is much more acceptable which we do for his poor
members, then if we should do it to his owne person, as being a signe
of greater love: For it is but an ordinary kindnesse to confer benefits
upon our dearest friends, but to extend our bounty to the poorest and
meanest that belong unto them, is a signe of much greater love. For
if for their sakes onely, we do good unto these, how much more would
we be ready to do it unto themselves, if they had occasion to crave our
help<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And as in this regard, he much esteemeth this Christian boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
so he will richly reward it also at the day of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

these mercifull men, who have relieved the poor for <hi>Christs</hi> sake, shall

            <p>And indeed what can be a more <hi>forcible reason to make our hearts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
though they be never so stony? and our bowels to yearn with pity</hi>
and compassion towards the poor; <hi>though they were of brasse,</hi> and <hi>iron,</hi>
Then to consider, that <hi>our dear Lord and Saviour in them doth crave re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe:</hi>
for who is so more then bru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

him away empty handed? <hi>Who being infinitely rich in all glory and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
was contented for our sakes to become poore, that by his povertly he
might communicate unto us his heavenly riches.</hi> Who would not give <hi>Christ</hi>
lodging? Yea even (if need should require) the use of his own bed, if
hee remember, that <hi>Christ</hi> was content so far to abase himselfe for our
sakes, <hi>as to make a stable his chamber,</hi> and <hi>a manger his lodging, that
we might be admitted into his heavenly, and everlasting mansious.</hi> Who
would <hi>deny to cloath him</hi> being naked? <hi>who hath cloathed our nakedness,
and covered our filthinesse with the precious robe of his righteousnesse, in
which we stand accepted before</hi> God, <hi>and receive the blessing of eternall
happinesse.</hi> Who would not spare food out of his owne belly to relieve
poore <hi>Christ,</hi> who hath given unto us his blessed body to be our meat,
and his precious blood to be our drinke, whereby our soules and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
are nourished unto everlasting life? Who would not
leave all pleasure and profit to go and visit him in his sicknesse and
imprisonment, that left heaven, and his Fathers bosome, that he
might come to visit and redeem us with the inestimable price of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe?
Yea, if wise, we will count it an honour, whereof we are very
unworthy. <hi>As most unworthy we are of such an honour as to relieve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,

counted, and called it a favour that they might have their hand in so

            </p>
            <p>And so much touching the reasons and motives to this Christian

doubt whether to give or no; as the gouty lamenesse of such, as after
they are resolved to give, make but slow hast. The greater speed,
the greater love, for love can abide no lingring. Then does a benefit
loose his grace, when it sticks in his fingers who is about to bestow it,
as though it were not given, but plucke from him: and so the receiver
praiseth not his Benefactors bounty, but his owne importunity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

of the giver, so it doubleth the benefit to him that receiveth it.
<hi>Nam bis dat qui cito dat,</hi> he gives twice, that giveth quickly; and the
swifter that a benefit cometh, the sweeter it tasteth. Present relief
to present want, makes a bounty weightier. And he cannot but esteem
the benefit, that unexpectedly receives help in his deepest distresse:
Whereas a benefit deferred, loses the thanks, &amp; many times proves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
to him that expects it. <hi>Joshuah marches all night, and fights

through the receivers shamefastnesse,

            <p>Another thing required in doing good works, is constancy and assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duity,

he never does any good at all, or if he do, it is at his death. The
miserly Muckworms manner is, never to be liberall till he dies never
to <hi>forsake, or leave his goods,</hi> untill <hi>his goods leave and forsake him.</hi>
Being like the <hi>Muckhill,</hi> that never does good till carried out: or the

relieves some sew at his death, and befriends them with the plaisters

            </p>
            <p>Now herein is the difference between grace, and corrupt nature:
the <hi>Christian</hi> exerciseth himselfe in the works of mercy, in the whole
course of his life, and giveth his goods to the poor, while he might
enjoy them himself: but the wordling is only liberal at the approach of
death, and then alone he is content to employ them this way, when
as he seeth he can keep them no longer. And that not out of love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>God,</hi> or the poor, but out of feare of approaching judgement,
and that dreadfull account which he must presently make before a just
and terrible Judge: Or out of self-love, either that he may gaine the
vain-glory of the world, or that he may satisfie for his sins, and to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape
eternall condemnation. In which respect he giveth to the poor,
and <hi>casts his bread upon the face of the waters, as the Merchant casts his
goods into the sea in time of a storme, to preserve the ship from sinking, and
himselfe from drowning.</hi> For were he not in danger to make ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack
of his soul, and of sincking into the gulfe of hell, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
he would be no more liberall at his death, then he hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
been in the whole course of his life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But</hi> what do I speak of his being liberall or the approach of Death?
for not one of a thousand of these ever entertain such a thought. Ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>they love all the world so little, that if it were</hi> possible, <hi>they would with</hi>
Hermocrates, <hi>make themselves their owne Executors,</hi> and bequeath their
goods to none else. As he that gives not till he dies, shewes that he
would not give if he could help it; and so it appears by their not part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with it, till they be plucked from it: For to give when they dye,
and when they can keep it no longer, is not worth thanks, it is not in
some sense their own to bestow, but rather to be liberall of that which
is indeed none of their own, but other mens. <hi>Neither will God thou ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of it, or hereafter reward it;</hi> which proves the <hi>covetous man no less
foolish, then wicked;</hi> for as <hi>one light carried before us,</hi> does us more good
then <hi>many that are brought after:</hi> so does a little given in a mans life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,
more benefit him, then thousands at the hour of death. Because
what the charitable man gives while he is alive and in health he shall
carry with him being dead; whereas the uncharitable man shall leave
his gold behind him, but carry the guilt with him into everlasting fire.
So that <hi>Misers</hi> may fitly be likened to the <hi>Mules of Princes,</hi> that go all
day <hi>laden with treasure,</hi> and covered with gay cloaths; and at night,
after a tedious and wearisome journey, their treasure is taken from
them, and they shaken off into a sorry stable, much galled and brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with the carriage of those treasures, their galled backs onely left
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56896:31"/>
unto themselves: For after all these mens toyle and slavery, what they
have shall be taken from them, and they turned off with their woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
consciences<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to that loathsome and irksome stable of hell and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
Wherefore, <hi>he that hath</hi> either <hi>grace</hi> or <hi>wit, will make his
owne hands his Executors, and his eyes his Overseers.</hi> Nor are we <hi>sheep

And also <hi>Solomon; As he came forth of his mothers belly, he shall return

         <div n="41" type="chapter">

            <p>First, touching Labour or Industry in lawfull getting and eneteasing
by all lawfull meanes in our Callings, that it enables a man to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
this duty, the <hi>Apostle</hi> sheweth in preseribing it to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi>
as a means of bounty and beneficence; <hi>Let him that stole steale no more,
but rather let him labour, working with his owne hands the thing which is
good, that he may have to give to him that needs.</hi> And <hi>Solomon</hi> deseribing
the vertuous woman, saith in the first place, that <hi>she seekes wool and
flaxe, and workes willingly with her hands;</hi> that <hi>she layes her hands to
the spindle, and her hands hold the distasse:</hi> and then that <hi>she stretches
out her hands to the poore,</hi> yea <hi>she reaches forth her hands</hi> to the <hi>needy.</hi>
And St. Luke having testified of <hi>Derom,</hi> that she <hi>was full of good works
and alme deeds which she did:</hi> He soone after sheweth the meanes, and
fountaine of her beneficence, to wit her labour and industry, <hi>in making
costs and garments.</hi> So <hi>Peter Martyrs</hi> Wife is commended for having
been a prudent and painfull housewife, and bountifull to the poor and
needy, the former good quality enabling her to the latter. Be we
therefore painfull and industrious in our severall callings, that GOD
may prosper and replenish us with good things, that so we may the
better communicate them to others.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Frugality or thriftinesse in spending our goods lawfully got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten:</hi>
For thrift, (which is a due saving from sinfull and needlesse
expences) must be as the purveyor for liberality. Be spuring in unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
expences, that thou mayest be liberall in good uses, and this
will mightily manifest thy heart to be right. <hi>The fuell of charity is fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality,
and the flame piety,</hi> as we may see in <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

expenses, a liberall man abounds more in good words. Whence
observe that rule of our Saviours, so to dispose of that plenty which
<hi>Gods</hi> goodnesse hath bestowed on us, as that <hi>nothing be lost, John 6. 12.</hi>

makes St. <hi>James</hi> utter these dreadfull words, <hi>Chap. 5. Go to now ye
rich men, weep and howle for the miseries that shall come upon you; Tour
riches are corrupted, and your garments moth-eaten: Tour gold and silver
is canckered, and the rust of them shall be a witnesse against you, and shall
eate your flesh as it were fire:</hi> and more of the like, <hi>Vers. 1. to 7.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But lest I should step too far out of the way, return we to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in hand, which is thrist or frugality, and not covetousnesse or cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty.
As</p>
            <p>Oh! how liberall might we be in charitable uses, and in shewing
mercy, if we would <hi>use Thrift as a Razor,</hi> to cut or shave off all su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstuous
expences, about unlawfull and unnecessary things: if we
would lay it as <hi>a rule,</hi> to moderate and diminish all expences about
things even lawfull. A good <hi>layer up, is a good layer out,</hi> as is plainly
verified in that <hi>vertuous Ruth,</hi> who was no lesse pious and charitable
in spending, then soberly frugall in sparing and saving; for she <hi>brought</hi>
forth, <hi>and gave to her poore Mother in Law, that she had reserved at
dinner,</hi> after she was satisfied. <hi>Frugality,</hi> saith <hi>Justine, is the mother
of vertues.</hi> I am sure it is the basis, and foundation, the pillar and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter
of liberality and benificence. For instance, though <hi>Peter Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr</hi>
had forsaken all for the <hi>Gospell</hi> sake, and left his great riches and
preserments he did enjoy in <hi>Italy,</hi> having nothing to live on but a
small stipend for his <hi>Professorship at Strosbourg:</hi> Yet being very frugall
and sparing, he had enough to maintain himselfe, and to helpe his
friends too: whereas on the contrary, an expensive man by his wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
and over-lavishing of his estate, disables him from doing good to
himselfe or others.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="42" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. XLII.</head>
            <p>But you will aske me, from what must we save?</p>
            <p>I answer, <hi>from Riot, Luxury, Drunkenness, Garning, and such like
sinfull expences,</hi> by which men waste and lavish that which might suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
many others besides themselves. Yea, that <hi>sordid sinne of drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi>
besides robbing the poor, <hi>hath brought a multitude of rich men to
poverty, and poor men to beggery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, from <hi>Banquetting and feasting,</hi> wherein at the least, one
of these three spots of unthristinesse is commonly seen: <hi>Excesse of fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency,
excesse of plenty, or excesse of delicacy.</hi> With some feasters it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
Holiday, never considering that the <hi>Rich man in the Gospell</hi> is
not so much branded for <hi>feasting sumptuously,</hi> as for <hi>feasting sumptuously
every day.</hi> Others, though they feast their friends but seldome, yea
when they do, they resemble <hi>Isaacius Angelus,</hi> whose usuall feasts
did so exceed in abundance and quantity of provision, that they were
said to be nothing else but <hi>a mountaine of loaves, is forrest of wild beasts,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:56896:33"/>
Thirdly, others are so for delicacy, that like <hi>Philenenus</hi> that <hi>Belly-god,</hi>
they think that sweetest, that is dearest. It is <hi>a horrible wide that
is practised by many</hi> now adayes, even meane ones, they <hi>scorae</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth
that any <hi>Butchers meat,</hi> should be admitted <hi>their Table</hi> when they
<hi>feast</hi> it. The cru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> rule of Feasts and Banquets seeme to be dead with
our Forefathers, whose dishes for sort, number, price, and serving
out, was inferiour to our sawce, insomuch that lesse then tho rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
might suffice the whole company, though they suffer the poor to
starve, who might be well sed with the superfluity thereof. <hi>Tantum
luxuries potuit suadere malorum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, much might he saved, out of what men spend lavishly in
<hi>Apparrell and Rayment:</hi> For many spend so much in the number, mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and making of their Garments, that they have little left to be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall
withall. The <hi>French proverb,</hi> that <hi>Silke quenches the fir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> that
are <hi>scarce able to pay for wool?</hi> Yea, some can <hi>carry whole Mannors upon
their backs, heads, feet,</hi> and <hi>fingers,</hi> what hospitality then can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from such?</p>
            <p>Fifthly, much might be spared of what is lavishly spent in keeping
of <hi>Coaches.</hi> As Oh! the fearfull Pride, Atheisme, contempt of <hi>Gods
Word,</hi> and want of compassion to <hi>Christs</hi> poor members; that is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested
in, and the sad account that men have to give even for this ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable
excess. I dare say, many within these few years, have and
do <hi>keepe Coaches,</hi> who can remember the time, that they or their
Fathers would have been <hi>glad to be kept in an Almes-house.</hi> And who
<hi>spend more in one yeare upon this Lordly vanity, then they do in twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
yeares upon these works of mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know it is lawfull enough for many to keep them: but if they can
afford to spend forty pounds a yeare in keeping of a Coach, meerly for
pompe and pleasure, and cannot afford halfe so much to keep thousands
from starving in these hard times, wherein not one in two all the land
over, can get sufficient meate for their bellies, or cloaths to their
backs, or fire in their houses if they have any; certainly they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
look to be set at <hi>Christs right hand,</hi> and to heare that joyfull sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,

         <div n="43" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. XLIII.</head>
            <p>Sixthly, how much might be spared of what men vainely spend in
keeping of <hi>Horses, Hawkes, and Dogs?</hi> when not a few, change their
Ancestors liberality upon Christs members, into prodigality upon
Beasts. When they will <hi>kill an Horse of price, in the pursuit of a Hare
worth nothing.</hi> Or to be at <hi>twenty pounds</hi> a yeare charge <hi>in Hawkes, to
catch a few Partridges not worth so many-shillings:</hi> when the poore are
not so many groats the better for their worships.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, how much of that which might be given to the poore,
is wasted in <hi>that witch Tobacco,</hi> when many spend as much in <hi>that
wanton weed,</hi> as their honest Forefathers spent in substantiall hospita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity:
When <hi>an hundred pounds a yeare upon this precious stinke</hi> will scarce
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56896:33"/>
serve their turns, were it now as dear as it hath
been, Yea I have known <hi>a Knight and his company,
in one day drink out five pounds sterling, in five ounces of
Tobacco;</hi> which I am sure had been better bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon these charitable uses. The <hi>Knights</hi> name
was <hi>Huit.</hi> The <hi>Apothecaries</hi> Name that sold it,
was <hi>Bakon;</hi> at the <hi>Myter in Fleetstreet</hi> it was taken.</p>
            <p>Again, hundreds there are, that will buy all
the <hi>News Books, Declarations</hi> and <hi>Proclamations</hi> that
come forth, (which since the beginning of our
troubles, have amounted to no small sum) and
yet are so far from being bountiful to the poor,
that by their good wills, they will neither pay
debts nor duties. Others as bountiful and as good
<hi>Christians</hi> as they, that can afford to give <hi>three
pounds for a falling Band, five pounds for a Tulip, ten,
twenty pounds for a yard of Lace:</hi> But will <hi>Christ</hi>
take this well, and count them <hi>good Stewards?
when he shall sit upon his Throne, and judge every man
according to his deeds, Matth. 25. 31. to the end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To these might be added the vast sums of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that are lavisht out without measure, in need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
and unnecessary <hi>Buildings, and trimming of hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
as if the owners were to dwell for ever in this world;</hi>
So many <hi>Walks and Galleries, Turrets and Pyramides,
such setting up, pulling down, transposing, transplacing,
to make gay habitations,</hi> for the memory and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of mens Names: So much yearly bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in <hi>costly furniture;</hi> with which their houses
were well stufe and filled before; whereas multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
of people, by reason of the late civil wars,
are driven to wander about, as <hi>having no certain
dwelling-place, yea no other house then the wide world;
no other bed then the hard ground, and no other Canopy
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:56896:34"/>
then the wide Heaven.</hi> And so I might go on to
<hi>many hundreds spent in Law-suits,</hi> for the satisfying
of a self-will; so much spent in <hi>sports and needlesse
Journeys,</hi> in <hi>Gaming and Revelling,</hi> in <hi>kindnesses to
Friends and Neighbours,</hi> and many the like; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
they should be sparing in other things, that
they might be the more bountiful in this duty;
<hi>They spend where they should spare, and spare where God
biddeth them spend:</hi> Yea, whereas the godly man
spareth not onely from his superfluities, but even
from very necessaries, that he may have the more
to spend in bounty and beneficence: These on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
spare in the works of mercy, that they may
have the more to spend upon their sinful Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
But as the niggard that soweth not, shall
not reap; so the prodigal Worldling, <hi>that soweth
onely to the flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption; as it
is Gal. 6: 8.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now for conclusion of this point, if <hi>Frugallity</hi>
and saving, be so great an help to bounty and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality;
let it be our care to practice it; avoiding
<hi>both the extreams, Prodigality on the one side, and Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice
on the other;</hi> for this (as all other <hi>vertues)</hi> is <hi>pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
between two extreams,</hi> as <hi>the Planet Jupiter,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>cold Saturn, and fiery Mars;</hi> Let it be <hi>used as a
razor of all wicked and superfluous, and as a rule of all
good and necessary expences;</hi> For <hi>that stock is like to
last, that is neither hoarded up miserably, nor dealt out
indiscreetly:</hi> We <hi>fow</hi> not <hi>the furrow</hi> by the <hi>sack full,</hi>
but <hi>by the handful;</hi> and the wise man knows, it is
better <hi>looking through a poore Lettice-window, then
through an Iron Grate.</hi> Let it quite shave off, all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penses
about <hi>Surfeiting</hi> and <hi>Drunkenness, Harlotry</hi>
and <hi>Wantonness,</hi> with other debauched courses,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:56896:34"/>
which many amongst the <hi>Heathens</hi> have been asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of; and therefore should <hi>not be once named a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Christians, Eph. 5. 3.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nomina sunt ipso, pene timenda sono.</p>
            <p>And let is also moderate and diminish those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive
charges which too commonly men are at,
about things lawful and commendable; because
if men would so do, the poor would be richly
provided for: As how much might be saved, how
many <hi>millions of money every year;</hi> and how abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
might we be in works of mercy, and yet be
never the poorer at the years end? Yea how would
they <hi>praise God, and pray for their bountiful Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors?</hi>
And how would <hi>God bless us in our souls, bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
names, estates and posterities?</hi> As he hath abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
promised in his Word.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="44" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. XLIV.</head>
            <p>AND so much of the <hi>means</hi> enabling to this
duty: Now of <hi>the ends</hi> we are to propound to
our selves in the doing of it, wherein I wil be brief.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, As our Alms or <hi>Works of mercy, should
flow from faith, obedience, charity, mercy, unfeigned
love; &amp;c.</hi> which are proper onely to true belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
and such as in <hi>Christ</hi> are first accepted; (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
as <hi>a woman</hi> that abides <hi>without an Husband,</hi> all
her fruit is but as <hi>an unlegitimate birth;</hi> So <hi>until we
be marryed to Christ, all our best works are as bastards;</hi>
and no better then <hi>shining sins,</hi> or <hi>beautiful abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
as the <hi>Apostle</hi> telleth us, <hi>Heb. 11. 6. Rom. 14, 23.)</hi>
So our aim and end must be, <hi>the glory of God, the
good of our brethren,</hi> who are refreshed with our
Alms, the <hi>adorning of our Profession</hi> with these fruits
of Piety, <hi>the edification of others</hi> by our good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
<hi>the stopping of the mouths of our Adversaries,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56896:35"/>
our own</hi> present <hi>good,</hi> both in respect of <hi>temporal</hi>
and <hi>spiritual</hi> benefits, and <hi>the furthering</hi> and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of <hi>our eternal salvation;</hi> all which shews that
howsoever any man may give gifts out of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
pity; yet onely the <hi>Christian</hi> and godly man,
can rightly perform this duty of Alms-deeds; for
it is a good work; and there are <hi>none do good, but
those that are good;</hi> neither is it possible that there
should be <hi>good fruit, unless it sprung from a good Tree:</hi>
Charity and Pride do both feed the poor; the one
to the praise and glory of God, the other to get
praise and glory amongst men; in which Case
<hi>God</hi> will not accept, but reject a mans bounty. As
when one sent a Present to <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> he sent it
back again, saying, <hi>He sendeth these Gifts ambitiou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly,
and it is our ambition to refuse them.</hi> The <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite</hi>
aimeth chiefly at his own glory and good,
either the obtaining of some worldly benefit, or
the avoiding of some temporal or everlasting pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment;
or finally, that he may satisfie <hi>God</hi>'s ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
for his sins, make him, beholding unto him,
and merit at his hands everlasting happiness.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Christian</hi> doth these works of mercy
with great humility, remembring that whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
he giveth to the poor for <hi>Gods</hi> sake, he hath
first received it from <hi>God,</hi> with all other blessings
which he enjoyeth: In which respect when he
doth the most, he acknowledgeth that he doth
far less then his duty, and that with much infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
and weakness; and therefore in this regard
he humbly confesseth that his Almes are <hi>sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rewarded,</hi> if they be graciously <hi>pardoned;</hi> the
which, as it maketh him to carry himself <hi>humbly
before God,</hi> so also <hi>meekly and gently towards the poore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:56896:35"/>
And indeed our <hi>axes, saws, hammers</hi> and <hi>chisels,</hi>
may as well and as justly rise up and <hi>boast, they
have built our houses,</hi> and <hi>our pens</hi> receive the honor
of our <hi>writings,</hi> as we attribute to our selves, the
praise of any of our good actions. And it
were as ridiculous so to do, as <hi>to give the Souldiers
honor to his sword; For of him, and through him, and
for him are all things: to whom be glory for ever, Amen.
Rom. 11. 36.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we have any thing that is <hi>good, God is the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of it;</hi> if we do any thing <hi>well, he is the Author</hi>
of it, <hi>Joh. 3. 2. Rom. 11. 36. 1 Cor.</hi> 4. 7. &amp; 11. 23. We
have not onely received our talents, but the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
also is his meer bounty. <hi>Thou hast
wrought all our works in us,</hi> saies the Prophet <hi>Isaiah,
Chap. 26. ver. 12.</hi> We do good Works, but so much
as is good in them, is not ours, but God's: We for
these things, <hi>magis Deo debitor est, quam Deus homini;</hi>
are rather debtors to <hi>God,</hi> then <hi>God</hi> to us. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
so much as give him <hi>gratias,</hi> thanks; unless
he first give us <hi>gratiam,</hi> the grace of thankfulness.
<hi>God</hi> gives not onely <hi>grace asked,</hi> but <hi>grace to ask:</hi>
We cannot be patient under his hand, except his
hand give us patience. <hi>God must infuse, before we
can effuse.</hi> The <hi>springs</hi> of our hearts must be <hi>filled
from that ocean, before we can derive drink to the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty.</hi>
For as the <hi>virtue</hi> attractive <hi>to draw Iron,</hi> is not
in the Iron, but <hi>in the Adamant;</hi> so all our abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is of <hi>God,</hi> and nothing as our own can we chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge,
save our defects and infirmities.</p>
            <p>Whence that of <hi>Austin,</hi> Lord look not upon
my Works, but upon thy Works which thou hast
done in me, or by me; which indeed he does
even to the amazement and astonishment of all
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:56896:36"/>
that are wise and truly thankful: For (mark it
well) first he gives us power to do well, and then
he recompenceth and crowneth that work which
we do well by his grace and bounty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bernard</hi> reports of <hi>Pope Eugenius,</hi> that meeting
<hi>a poor, but honest Bishop,</hi> he secretly <hi>gave</hi> him <hi>certain
jewels</hi> wherewith he might <hi>present him,</hi> as the
custom was for such to do: So if <hi>God</hi> did not
first furnish us with his graces and blessings, wee
should have nothing wherewith to honor him, or
do good to others. <hi>Of thine own I give thee, said
Justinian the Emperor,</hi> borrowing it from the <hi>Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist,
1 Chron. 29. 14.</hi> The use whereof before we
leave it, would be this: First hope we for, but
challenge not a reward for our well-doing: yet
not for it self, but for what <hi>Christ</hi> hath done for,
and by us.</p>
            <p>Let this be the temper of our spirits, when we
do any duty; Do we the work, give <hi>God</hi> the praise.
To us the use of his gifts; to him the thanks and
glory for ever. Yea having received all we have
from him, and done all that we do by him; what
madness and folly is it, not to refer the glory and
praise of all to him, as the Apostle argues, <hi>Rom.
11. 36.</hi> to which he adds, as an injunction; <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ye eat or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the
glory of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 31.</p>
            <p>O <hi>God,</hi> if we do any thing that is good, it is
thine act, and not ours: Crown thine own work
in us, and take thou the glory of thine own mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>God</hi> bestoweth upon us many indowments, to
the end onely, that we should imploy them to
his honor, and best advantage that gave them
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:56896:36"/>
us: For that he may be honored by our <hi>wisdom,
riches, graces,</hi> is the onely end for which he gives
us to be <hi>wise, rich, gracious, Matth. 25. 27, 30 1 Cor.
12. 7. &amp; 14. 26. Rom. 12. 6. Ephes. 4. 11, 12.</hi> Yea it is
the onely end for which we were created, <hi>Isa. 43.
v. 7.</hi> &amp; therefore it hath alwaies been the aim, end
&amp; <hi>mark</hi> which all the Saints have ever indeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>to hit,</hi> though with <hi>several shafts;</hi> as the same
<hi>beams</hi> are <hi>many,</hi> but the <hi>light one.</hi> For whereas the
<hi>ignorant ascribe the effects</hi> and events of things <hi>to
Fortune,</hi> the <hi>Atheist</hi> to <hi>Nature,</hi> the <hi>Superstitious</hi> to
their <hi>Idols,</hi> the <hi>Politician</hi> to <hi>his plots,</hi> the <hi>Proud-man</hi>
to his <hi>own power</hi> and <hi>parts,</hi> too many to <hi>second causes:</hi>
in all these the <hi>Servants of God</hi> look higher, resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
all such effects to their first principle, <hi>Digi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
Dei, the finger of God;</hi> ascribing to Him the
praise, as I might abundantly shew from the
Word, could I stand upon it: Yea, even <hi>Titus the
Emperor</hi> when he was praised for a victory that he
had got, made answer, <hi>That it proceeded from God,
who made his hands but the instruments to serve him,</hi> as
<hi>Josephus</hi> testifies. The Godly, as they <hi>do all by his
power,</hi> so they <hi>refer all to his glory.</hi>

goods, victories, preferments, &amp;c. my self, and by
mine own wisdom and providence, which the

incense unto their drag, Hab. 1. 16.</hi> Even as it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with the <hi>children of Dan, Judges 18.</hi> who ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
the honor of their success to <hi>their Idols.</hi> Or
as it fared with <hi>Israel, God</hi> gave them sheep and
Oxen, and they offered them up to <hi>Baal:</hi> He gave
them <hi>Ear-rings</hi> and <hi>Jewels</hi> for their own orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and they turned them to an <hi>Idol:</hi> Yea,
poor silly souls, they are like <hi>Swine,</hi> that <hi>feed upon
Acorns,</hi> without ever <hi>looking to the Oake</hi> from
whence they <hi>fell.</hi> Or the <hi>Horse</hi> that <hi>drinks of the
Brook,</hi> and never thinks of the <hi>Spring. Christ</hi> rains
down <hi>Mannah,</hi> they gather it and eat it, and
scarce ever think from whence they had it; at
least the thought of his blessings is out of their
minds, as soon as the taste is out of their mouths.
As but one of those Ten, that could lift up their
voices for cure of their <hi>Leprosie,</hi> return'd with
thanks when they were cleansed; so it is ten to
one if any give glory to God: <hi>Luck,</hi> or <hi>wit,</hi> or
<hi>friend,</hi> one thing or other still lies in their way,
and takes up <hi>Christ's glory,</hi> and the thanks ere it
can come at him. <hi>Customary fruition</hi> hath made
men scarce think themselves beholding to God.
But as he that having <hi>fed his body,</hi> and asswaged
his hunger, <hi>and gives no thanks, steals his meat;</hi> so in
all other things. In <hi>visible benefits,</hi> not to see the
<hi>invisible giv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r,</hi> is great infidelity and blindness:
and indeed, if any thing infallibly proves an <hi>hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite,</hi>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:56896:37"/>
it is when <hi>base ends</hi> are the <hi>first movers of
good duties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now what I have spoken of good men in this
point, I might shew of good <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>glorified
Saints in Heaven;</hi> yea of <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Idolaters;</hi>
yea I might add, that not to be thankful, nor to
acknowledge what <hi>God</hi> our bountiful Benefactor,
bestows upon, and does for us, is to fall short of the
very <hi>brute Beasts: The Ox knows</hi> no Owner but man,
and him he does acknowledg and love according
to his capacity, <hi>Isa. 1. 3.</hi> And it's well known what
strange things are recorded of <hi>Lyons, Dogs, Eagles;</hi>
yea, how oft shall we see <hi>a Dog welcome home his
Master,</hi> with all possible expressions of love and
thankfulness, when perhaps <hi>his Wife</hi> entertains
him <hi>with frumps and frowns:</hi> And certainly, had <hi>beasts</hi>
the like knowledge with us, of their <hi>Maker,</hi> they
would worship and serve him better then do their
Masters; but for proof of this enough. Though
indeed, if the very worst of men did but know
and consider how they should pleasure themselves
in being humble and thankful, they would use
all their possible endeavours to that end; As most
<hi>pleasant</hi> it is to <hi>God,</hi> and most <hi>profitable to us,</hi> both
for the <hi>procuring the good we want,</hi> and for the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of the good we have.</hi>

And in common Equity, he that is unthankful
for a little, is worthy of nothing; whereas thanks
for one good turn, is the best introduction to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.
<hi>Holy David</hi> was a <hi>man according to Gods own
heart;</hi> and therefore he continually mixeth with
his <hi>Prayers, Praises;</hi> and being of a <hi>publike spirit,</hi> he
<hi>discovereth the secrets of this skill:</hi> As when he saith,
<hi>Let the people praise thee, O God, let all the people praise
thee; then shall the earth bring forth her encrease, and
God, even our God shall give us his blessing, Psal. 67. 5, 6,
7.</hi> When <hi>Heaven and Earth</hi> are friends, then <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
and Winter, Seed-time</hi> and <hi>Harvest,</hi> run on their
race. When God was displeased, what was the
effect? <hi>Ye have sown much, and have reaped little.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
when <hi>God</hi> was pleased, mark the very day;
<hi>For from that very day I will bless you, Hag.</hi> 2. 15. to 20
Whensoever glory is given to <hi>God on high,</hi> peace &amp;
good will shall be bestowed on <hi>men below, Luk. 2. 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Psal. 84<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 11, 12. Noah</hi> gave a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of Praise for
his deliverance from the <hi>Flood;</hi> And <hi>God</hi> being prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
for that one deliverance, he perpetuateth his
blessing, and promiseth an everlasting deliverance
to the World from any more Floods.</p>
            <p>Again, it is the only way to procure <hi>Gods Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi>
upon our endeavours: It happened that <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi>
one day made a curious and learned <hi>Sermon,</hi>
for which he expected great applause, but recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
none: The next time he made a plain whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
Sermon, and it was wonderfully affected, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
and commended. A friend of his noting it,
askt him what might be the reason? Who an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
In the one I preached <hi>Bernard,</hi> in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Christ;</hi> in the one I sought to win glory and
praise to my self; in the other, the glory of <hi>God,</hi>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:56896:38"/>
and the <hi>salvation of souls,</hi> which received blessing
from above, and that made the difference; yea,
were there nothing good else in it, yet this were
the way to gain true honor:</p>
            <p>We cannot so much honour our selves, as by
seeking to honour <hi>God: To seek a mans own glory,</hi>
(says <hi>Solomon) is not glory, Prov. 25. 25. 27.</hi> but to seek
<hi>Gods glory,</hi> is the greatest honour a man can do
himself: For as <hi>Cicero</hi> said of <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> That
in extolling of dead <hi>Pompey,</hi> and erecting his <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,</hi>
he set up his own: So who are more vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
esteemed and spoken of, then such as are
most tender of <hi>Gods glory,</hi> and least seeke their
own. They are the <hi>Lord</hi>'s own words to <hi>Saul, They
that honour me, I will honour; but they that despise me,
shall be lightly esteemed, 1 Sam. 2. 30:</hi> The way for a
man to be esteemed <hi>the greatest,</hi> is to esteem him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<hi>the least.</hi> It is humility that makes us accepted
both of <hi>God &amp; Man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> whereas the contrary makes
us hated and abhorred of both: The <hi>Centurion</hi> did
many excellent things, but he never did a Work
so acceptable in the sight of <hi>Christ,</hi> as was his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming
his own Works. While <hi>Saul</hi> vvas little
in his ovvn eyes, God made him Head over the
<hi>twelve Tribes of Israel,</hi> and gave him his Spirit; but
when out of his Greatness he abused his Place
and Gifts, <hi>God</hi> took both from him, and gave them
to <hi>David,</hi> whom <hi>Saul</hi> least respected of all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
<hi>1 Sam.</hi> 15. 17. 28. &amp; 16. 14. Other proofs of such
as he will honor, for honoring him, you have <hi>Gen.
39. 21. Zeph. 3 19, 20. Dan.</hi> 2. 19. to 50. as when <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar</hi>
sought his own honor, honor depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from him, and he was made like a Beast; but
when he sought God's honor, honor came to him
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:56896:39"/>
again, and he was made a <hi>King, Dan. 4. 34.</hi> to the
end. <hi>Before honour, goeth humility, Prov. 15. 33.</hi> But
<hi>when pride cometh, then cometh shame, Prov. 11. 2.</hi> And
commonly great Works undertaken for ostentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
miss of their end, and turn to the Author's
shame; nor have any less praise then they that
most hunt after it.</p>
            <p>It's true, the <hi>Lord</hi> sometimes gives wicked men
even what in their thoughts they ask; as some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
riches onely, and God gives it them with a
curse; some honor and dignity, and they have it,
that their fall may be the greater; others fame
and reputation <hi>(as loving the praise of men more
then the praise of God)</hi> and these have many times
what they aim at; they are extolled to the skies,
and that shall be the reward of all the good that
ever they do. Lastly, God's people make spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
and eternal things, Grace and Glory, and
God's favour their onely option, and they have
their desire; yea not seldom, are riches and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
super-added, though they seek them not;
they seek onely God's <hi>glory</hi> on <hi>Earth;</hi> as for <hi>their
own glory,</hi> they let that alone till they come to
<hi>Heaven,</hi> knowing that he onely is happily famous,
who is known and recorded there: True, he lives
so well, that the praise of men (especially good
men) will follow; but as I said before, so say I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
he wil not follow it, least to <hi>gain the shadow,</hi>
he should <hi>lose the substance;</hi> as <hi>Absolom in seeking a
Kingdom, lost himself.</hi>

            <p>IT is a sad thing to consider, how many <hi>formal
Christians</hi> gul themselves, in thinking that
<hi>Christ</hi> will reward them, when they have done
him no service: As for example, we find the <hi>Jews</hi>
in the 58. of <hi>Esay,</hi> urging God with their <hi>fasting,</hi>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:56896:39"/>
(as those <hi>Reprobates, Luke 13.</hi> alledge unto him
their <hi>preaching in Christs Name, &amp; casting out Devils)
We have fasted</hi> (say they) <hi>and thou seest it not; we have
afflicted our selves, and thou takest no notice thereof;</hi> they
expect some great reward; but the Lord answers,
<hi>Have ye fasted to me?</hi> No such matter; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
sends them away empty, <hi>ver. 25.</hi> to 29. And so
will he say unto these (that perhaps do many
good works for the matter of them) Have ye
done these and these things in <hi>love, obedience,</hi> and
<hi>thankfulness</hi> unto me, and that in <hi>Christs</hi> Name,
that my Name may be magnified, and my People
won and edified? No, but in love to your own
credit, profit, and such like carnal respects; and
therefore look to it (as you love your own souls)
for if in doing good, and discharging our places,
we have served our selves, and sought our selves
rather then God; when we come for his reward,
(as <hi>Esau</hi> when he had brought the <hi>Venison,</hi> came
for <hi>the blessing,</hi> making himself as sure of it, as if
he had had it, before he kneeled for it) God's an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
will be, Let him reward you whom you have
served; <hi>Thou servedst thy self, reward thy self,</hi> if thou
wilt; for I never reward any service but mine
own: The <hi>Pharisaical giver,</hi> gives to himself, not
to <hi>God; Dat sibi non Domino;</hi> He aims at his own
praise, what reward can he look for, let him pay
himself: But <hi>our Saviour, Mat. 6.</hi> makes the case
so plain, that none can question it: <hi>Take heed</hi>
(saith he) <hi>that ye do not your almes, that ye pray not,
that ye fast not to be seen of men;</hi> otherwise, <hi>ye have no
reward of your Father which is in heaven, ver. 1:</hi> and
in <hi>ver. 2. 5, 16:</hi> speaking of the <hi>Scribes and Pharisees,</hi>
that did <hi>give</hi> their <hi>Alms, prayed</hi> and <hi>fasted to be seen
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:56896:40"/>
and praised of men;</hi> he saith affirmatively, That
<hi>they had their reward:</hi> And that we might the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be warned, he adds to it. <hi>Verily, Verily, v. 5. 16</hi>
Yea, in the next Chapter he gives us several in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of such as shall at the last day knock at
Heaven Gates, (as it were) and cry out, <hi>Lord, Lord,
open unto us, for by thy Name we have done many good
things: To whom the Lords answer will be, Depart from
me all ye workers of iniquity, I know you not whence ye
are, ver. 22, 23.</hi> And the reason of it is, <hi>Civil mens
good works<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are as a meer Carkase without the soul,</hi> since
<hi>Faith</hi> is wanting: Nor is it any excuse before God,
to plead that the <hi>matter</hi> of the Work is <hi>good,</hi> when
<hi>the end is not so;</hi> for which, see <hi>Isa. 66: 3:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, That the proud and unthankful shal
lose the reward of all their performances, is not
all; for as <hi>thankfulness</hi> and <hi>humility<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> are the onely
means to enrich us with God's Bles<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ings; so <hi>pride</hi>
and <hi>unthankfulness</hi> is the onely way to make God
withdraw and take from us both himself and his
blessings, yea instead thereof to send his curse,
and to cross us in all we do, as may be proved
plentifully: <hi>When the people became murmurers, it
displeased the Lord, and the Lord heard it; therefore his
wrath was kindled, and the fire of the Lord burnt among
them, and consumed the utmost part of the Host, Numb.

the borders of the people, and have spoiled their treasures,
and have pulled down the Iuhabitants like a valiant man,
Esay 10: 13:</hi> When <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi>

what came of it, <hi>Dan. 4. Act. 12, 21, 22, 23. Esop</hi>'s

To whom <hi>Tamberlain</hi> replied, That it was no <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
so ingrateful a man should be made such a spectacle
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:56896:41"/>
of misery.</hi> All which wise <hi>Solomon</hi> confirmeth,
<hi>Prov. 11. 28.</hi> and also <hi>Job, Chap. 31. ver. 24, 25, 28.
Gods glory to him</hi> is as the <hi>Crown to the King:</hi> Now
there is less danger in stealing any thing from
the <hi>King,</hi> then his <hi>Crown,</hi> for if men <hi>rob him of his
Tribute,</hi> or <hi>clip bis Coyn,</hi> he may perhaps <hi>pardon</hi> it:
(though that were much, and he is not discreet
that will run the hazard.) But if they go about
to <hi>take his Crown from him,</hi> there is <hi>no hope of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
pardon</hi> for that.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>God</hi> is very bountiful in all other things; his
<hi>Wisdom he communicates,</hi> and <hi>his Justice he distributes,</hi>
and <hi>his Holiness he imparts,</hi> and <hi>his Mercy he bestows,</hi>
and <hi>his onely Son he hath freely given,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<hi>1 Cor: 1. 30, 31. But his Glory he will not give to
another,</hi> as himself speaks, <hi>Isa. 42. 8.</hi> And indeed
this is the main fruit and return that comes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>God</hi> from all his Works. This in the <hi>New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament</hi>
is as the <hi>fat of the burnt-offering</hi> was in <hi>the
Old:</hi> and we know <hi>all the fat was the Lords, and he
that did eat that, was to be cut off from his people, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit.
3. 16. &amp; 7. 25.</hi> If you will see it in an example,
look up on <hi>Herod;</hi> who in stead of giving the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of his gifts unto God, took it to himself, and
was <hi>cut off from his people, by, or after a strange and
unheard of manner, Acts 12.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus we see by what hath been said, that
if <hi>pride, covetousness, hypocrisie,</hi> or any the <hi>like springs,</hi>
shall <hi>set the wheels of our hearts a moving,</hi> our <hi>Honey</hi>
will prove but <hi>gall,</hi> and our <hi>Wine, Vinegar;</hi> yea, if
these be <hi>the ends</hi> of our doing duties, <hi>such an end
will follow it,</hi> as we had <hi>better be without it,</hi> even such
<hi>a misery at the end,</hi> as will know <hi>no end of misery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:56896:41"/>
Let men therefore beware they rob not <hi>God of
his glory,</hi> which he so much stands upon, least <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>
by <hi>God</hi>'s just permission, <hi>rob them</hi> of <hi>their souls,</hi>
which they ought so much to stand upon.</p>
            <p>Again secondly, if the Grace of <hi>God</hi> be the
<hi>Fountain</hi> ftom which all our endowments <hi>flow,</hi> and
that <hi>God</hi> may be honored by our gifts, is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
end of our injoying them; let us not so much
as <hi>share with God in squinting one eye at Gods, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at our own honor;</hi> Yea if <hi>God</hi> wil reward no
Work, nor bless it with his Grace, unless it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to his glory: Let us direct all our <hi>thoughts,
speeches, and actions to his glory,</hi> as he hath directed
our Eternal Salvation thereunto: Let us make
<hi>God</hi> the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega, the first and the last,</hi> of all
our actions and endeavours; Let us add this to all
our other gifts, that we give the glory of them to
<hi>God:</hi> As what else should men propose for their
end, then that glory which shal have no end? Yea
let us with one unanimous voice say, He hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
us all the Grace and Happiness we have, and
we wil give him all the possible thanks and honor
we can; let it be our main request and daily pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:
Teach us, O Lord, to receive the benefit of
thy merciful favours, and to return thee the
thanks and the glory, and that for ever and ever.
And so much of the <hi>Ends,</hi> which we are to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:56896:42"/>
do much hinder mens bounty and liberality to

delivered; but nothing like Covetousness;
yea name but <hi>Covetousness,</hi> and that includes all
the rest. <hi>Covetousness is the Grave of all good,</hi> it makes
the heart barren of all good inclinations; and it
is a <hi>bad ground where no flower will grow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It cannot be denyed, but enough hath been
said in this and <hi>the Poors Advocate,</hi> to perswade a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

will not come so near the same, as to give it the
hearing.</p>
            <p>Or suppose such an one should be so ingenuous
as to hear it, there is no hope of prevailing with
him: As what think you, when that <hi>rich man,
Mark 10 17.</hi> &amp;c. who <hi>ran after Christ, kneeled down
to him, and was so inquisitive to know how he might attain
eternal life;</hi> yea, who <hi>had from his youth squared his life
according to Gods Law,</hi> insomuch that <hi>Christ loved
him;</hi> Yet when he was <hi>admonished by our Saviour to
sell all and give to the poor, and he should have Treasure
in Heaven, he turned his back upon Christ, and went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
very sorrowful, because he was marvellous rich.</hi> He
had <hi>a good mind to Heaven in reversion;</hi> but for all
that, he would not part with his <hi>Heaven,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he had <hi>present possession:</hi> Whence our <hi>Saviour</hi>
so bewails the miserable condition and difficulty
of such mens being saved, <hi>v.</hi> 17. to 26. And the
<hi>Apostle</hi> the like, <hi>Eph. 5. 5. 1 Cor. 6. 9, 10.</hi> For if he
that had so good affections, made conscience of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:56896:42"/>
all his wayes, was so desirous to be saved, that
<hi>Christ</hi> was taken with him; What hope of this
Wretch that hath a <hi>blockish, seared,</hi> and <hi>senseless
Conscience,</hi> that is past feeling, and never made
scruple of any thing from his infancy? No, these
solid Arguments, and strong inducements from
<hi>Gods Word,</hi> wil be so far from prevailing with him,
that it is rare if he do not slight and scorn what
hath been spoken. The covetous man knows no
other God then his belly, and desires no other
Heaven then his Coffers full of Angels.</p>
            <p>Thirdly and lastly, admit the best that can be
expected, <hi>viz.</hi> that he shall not only lend a listen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ear to all that hath been said, but that it does
also convince, and almost perswade him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
liberal; As I dare appeal to their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
that have hitherto heard what hath
been alledged out of <hi>God's Word,</hi> whether it hath
not made their hearts burn within them; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they have not been convinced, and with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa,
almost perswaded to become merciful, Acts 26.
28.</hi> Whether with <hi>Pharoah,</hi> their spirits have not
began to thaw a little, <hi>Go, do sacrifice to your God
in this Land;</hi> yea in their judgements yeilded to
all that hath been demanded them, and been rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to pray some <hi>Moses</hi> to pray for them: And yet
harden and knit again, whereby all labour (like
<hi>Moses Message,</hi> or the sweet words of <hi>Paul</hi>) is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
lost. The covetous man, though he be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
in his confcience, and doth resolve to be
bountiful, yet no hope of his doing it; for his
<hi>goodness is as a morning Cloud, and as a morning dew; it
goeth away</hi> as the <hi>Lord</hi> once spake to <hi>Ephraim</hi> and
<hi>Judah, Hos 6. 4.</hi>

Good thoughts to carnal &amp; covetous hearts, are
only as <hi>Passengers,</hi> not <hi>Inhabitants;</hi> they may make it
a thorough-fare, but they can never settle or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
there: If at any time they melt with <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roah,</hi>
they suddenly knit again. Nor is there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
heart made of flesh, that wil not at some time
or other relent. Even <hi>Flint and Marble</hi> wil <hi>in some
weather stand in drops.</hi> It is not onely recorded of
<hi>Pharoah,</hi> that he did thus melt, and of <hi>Agrippa,</hi>
that he <hi>was almost perswaded to become</hi> good; but the
holy Ghost further testifies, that <hi>Esau wept; Ahab
put on Sackcloth,</hi> that <hi>Judas repented, and restored,</hi> that
<hi>Foelix trembled;</hi> that <hi>Pilate took Christs part, and
washt his hands in witness that he was free from the

then to <hi>wring Verjuice out of a Crab;</hi> yea, you may as

<hi>churlish Laban (Nabal</hi> I should say, though the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference

when <hi>distressed David</hi> askt him <hi>victuals, he

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56896:43"/>
might have given, and been never the poorer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but his foul mouth doth not onely deny, and
<hi>give him nothing,</hi> but that which was <hi>worse then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi>
bad<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Language; So fares it with these
Churls, when any <hi>David</hi> is driven to <hi>ask them
Bread, they give him stones</hi> instead thereof; let them
be moved by some one to give an Alms, or do
some charitable deed, <hi>they cannot hear on that ear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or if this Wretch for his credit sake, does
speak fair, <hi>all his good deeds be onely good words;</hi> and
he may be answered as <hi>that Beggar</hi> did the <hi>Bishop,</hi>
when instead of an Alms he gave him his blessing,
That if his blessing had been worth a penny, he
would not have been so bountiful. So that if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
house were of his profession, <hi>Charities Hand</hi>
would no longer <hi>hold up Poverties head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Words from a dead man,</hi> and deeds of <hi>Charity from
a covetous man,</hi> are both <hi>alike rare,</hi> and hard to
come by. The <hi>Mountains</hi> are not more <hi>barren of
fruit,</hi> then <hi>he of goodness; The Rocks are not so hard as
his heart;</hi> he is a friend to none but himself; <hi>His
Charity begins at home, and there it ends.</hi> To urge or
perswade him to be liberal, is all one, as to <hi>intreat
a Tyger to be tame and gentle,</hi> or <hi>a Wolf to be pittiful
and mercifull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is such <hi>an antipathy</hi> between his heart,
and one that is in distress, that he hath not the
patience to hear a poor man speake; yea out of a
desperate resolution to give him nothing, he wil
not vouchsafe to look upon him, but turn his
face or eyes another way, as though the poore
man were such an eye-sore, as might not be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured.
And this he does for fear of being infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the contagion of the poor mans misery;
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:56896:44"/>
or lest it should cause a spmpathy, and scllow-fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of his calamity; or lest his <hi>conscious eyes</hi> should
check his <hi>churlish heart,</hi> and put him in mind
of his <hi>barbarous inhumanity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let all such be assured, that as they turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
their eyes from the poor <hi>in the day of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery,</hi>
so the Lord wil turn away his face from them
<hi>in the day of their calamity:</hi> And <hi>as they have stopped
their ears at the cry of the poor, so they themselves shall
cry, and God will not hear them,</hi> as it is <hi>Prov. 21. 13.</hi>
And just it is, that as the unmerciful wil not hear
others when they stand in need, so <hi>God</hi> should not
regard them when they shal stand in need: <hi>Blessed are
the merciful</hi> (saith <hi>our Saviour</hi>) but that stands not
with his disposition; <hi>for the penny which comes out of
his purse, is like a drop of blood drawn from his heart;</hi>
and his reward shall be answerable.</p>
            <p>The <hi>covetous man's heart is like his Chest,</hi> ever
close shut, except it be to receive. He is sparing
&amp; <hi>niggardly in giving, but open handed to receive</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
is brought; like an <hi>Hog</hi> or <hi>Medler,</hi> he never
does <hi>good</hi> to any til he be <hi>dead and rotten,</hi> He is like
a <hi>Butlers earthen box,</hi> out of which nothing can be
drawn til it be <hi>broken;</hi> Or some kinde of <hi>Vermine,</hi>
which is of no use til <hi>uncased.</hi> He resembles <hi>a spunge</hi>
that <hi>soaks up excessively;</hi> but til <hi>Death</hi> comes
with his Iron grasp to <hi>squeeze</hi> him, he will <hi>not yeild
one drop;</hi> Onely then <hi>some good comes of his Goods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed it is gteat pity the <hi>State</hi> does not by
him, as <hi>Epaminondas</hi> did by such another, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

poor, (but would answer them like <hi>churlish Nabal,
Shall I give my meat and drink unto men whom I know

sent a poor man to him, and commanded him
under great penalty to give him presently
<hi>six hundred Crowns;</hi> who hearing it, came to <hi>Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minondas,</hi>
and asked him the cause thereof; Who
replyed, <hi>This man is poor and honest; and thou who hast
cruelly robbed the Commonwealth, art rich;</hi> and so
compelled him to be liberal in spight of his teeth:
Howbeit if they hanged him up (as <hi>Atillus</hi> a good
<hi>King of this Land,</hi> did all oppressors of the poor,
and distributed their Goods to those they had
impoverished) they did him no wrong: But for
want of this, like <hi>Horse-Leeches,</hi> or a sort of <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi>
too homely to name, that have no place for
voidance of their excrements, being neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
<hi>very insatiable,</hi> they <hi>swell with sucking of blood,
and so burst.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O the wretched and sad condition of <hi>a sordid,

like sots, under the sound of <hi>Gods Word,</hi> and are

            <p>ANd so you have (in this, and the other two
parts of <hi>the Poors Advocate</hi>) the necessity, the
matter, the manner, the nature, the kinds, the
quantity, the subject, the object, the time or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance,
the means, the motives, the ends, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments,
&amp; the remedies of this most excellent
Grace; or Christian Duty, so oft pressed, pattern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and commended in the Word. It remains
onely that I should apply them; for I have more
need to press the payment, then prove the Debt,
though sure I am, it is from the foulness of mens
stomacks, prevailing above the goodness of the
food, if what hath been delivered, does not prove
effectual. Wherefore in the first place, Hath <hi>God</hi>
so strictly commanded it? And is there such a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of shewing mercy to the poor members of
<hi>Jesus Christ?</hi> That there is no being saved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it, hath <hi>God</hi> therefore given us all, that we
may impart some part thereof to others that
want? Shall <hi>God</hi> have glory by it? Hath he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to bless the merciful man in his <hi>temporal,
civil, spiritual,</hi> and <hi>eternal estate?</hi> Is there no such
way to grow rich, as by being bountiful to the
poor? Is it the most certain and infallible way
never to want? Is sparing in this case, the worst
thrift? Wil with-holding from the poor, bring a
man to poverty? Shal we have the benefit of their
prayers, and their loins to bless us? Is this the Way
to obtain <hi>God</hi>'s blessing upon our persons, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we shall be kept in perpetual safety, &amp; deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the malicious practises of all our enemies?
Will <hi>God</hi> hear us, and send us succor in all times
of need (as we hear and pity the poor) and even
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:56896:46"/>
make our beds when we are sick. Wil what we have
this way distributed, stand us in more stead at the
<hi>hour of Death,</hi> and <hi>Day of Judgement,</hi> then all the
Wealth in the World? Shall the merciful be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
with illumination and conversion? Wil
these Works of Mercy bring such joy and peace,
confirm our hope, and sweeten all our afflictions?
Are they evident signs of saving Graces? And do
they assure us of our future reward; and fruition
of <hi>God's</hi> presence hereafter? Is it the onely way
to an honourable and honest repute and report,
living and dead, procuring all love and respect
from good and bad: Will <hi>God</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>bless the merciful
man with an happy match, &amp; a godly off-spring?
Shall what we give, be paid again unto our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and posterity, with an addition of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
blessings, who otherwise shall not prosper,
but be Vagabonds, and beg their bread. Is it a
thing so pleasing to <hi>God,</hi> that he accounts what
is given to them, as lent to him: And so accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to Christ (by reason of the near union that is
between him, the poor and us, being but one mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
body, whereof he is the Head) that what
we do to them, his members, he takes as done to
himself; and will accordingly reward it, or plague
the neglect thereof, both upon us &amp; ours here, and
our bodies and souls hereafter: Is it so, that what
we disburse in this World, we shall receive again
by Bill of Exchange in <hi>Heaven?</hi> And that it is not
so much given, as laid up? insomuch that we may
truly say, What we gave, that we have. If be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
all this, <hi>God</hi> hath promised to reward a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
mony, meat &amp; clothes, with an infinite &amp; Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Kingdom of glory, have the poor as true a right
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:56896:46"/>
to it, as we have to the residue? Are we no less
beholding to the poor, then they are to us? Would
we (were it our case) think the contrary very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal?
(For if we look on the sufferings of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
as heavier then our own, this will beget
thankfulness; if we look on the doings, gifts and
graces of others, as better then our own, this wil
beget humility.) Shall they thereby be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
able to serve <hi>God</hi> in their several stations? Shall
they have cause to pray for, and praise <hi>God</hi> for us?
Will it stop our enemies mouths, and make them
think the better of our Religion, and happily
win them to imbrace the truth; at least, <hi>seeing our
good works, they will glorifie our Father which is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?</hi>
Whereas the Poore shall onely have some
outward relief and comfott thereby? Shall wee
fare the better for it in our <hi>souls, bodyes, names, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
and posterities,</hi> with many the like which
might be added for our eucouragement to this
duty? Then they should serve (as one would
think) as so many effectual and strong arguments
to move every <hi>Christian</hi> to the diligent and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
doing of them.</p>
            <p>Yea, by this time (as I hope) I have made some
way in the Worldlings heart, to rellish the relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of the poor; at least it concerns men to
urge and press these motives upon themselves, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
they have compell'd their unwilling wils to
resolve to interest themselves into so many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
and blessings, and to shun the danger of so
many threats and judgements, as the neglect
thereof will incur: As did we thus hide the Word
of <hi>God</hi> in our hearts, and particularly apply
these things to our Consciences, it would work
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:56896:47"/>
this Grace in us all: Which otherwise will prove
no other, then as a sweet harmony of Musick to
a deaf man. It is not unknown to us, that <hi>Nathan</hi>
wrought more upon <hi>David</hi> by a particular, private
admonition, then all the <hi>Lectures</hi> of the Law
could do for three quarters of a year together.</p>
            <p>Yea, let but this be done, or indeed do but wel
weigh what hath been said, and it will be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to perswade any covetous <hi>Nabal</hi> alive (if he
hath either heart or brain) or indeed any care of,
or love to himself or his, to become as liberal as
<hi>Zacheus</hi> himself. However I doubt not but some
wil be so wise as to consider the premises, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
to give as God in his Word injoins; And that
others will do the same, if it be but meerly out of
self-love; for there cannot possibly be more ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
or strong inducements, more rare &amp; remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Benefits and Promises to any duty, then is
propounded to this particular Grace. Wherefore
<hi>if there be any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of
love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any compassion
and mercy towards</hi> your selves or others, <hi>think of
these things,</hi> accept of these blessings; rush not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
so many Curses, but <hi>break off your sins</hi> and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
unmercifulness, <hi>by righteousness, and your ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
by shewing mercy towards the poor, Dan. 4. 2. Distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to the necessities of the Saints, minister unto them of
your Substance,</hi> like <hi>Mary Magdalen, Joanna, the wife
of Chuza,</hi> and <hi>Susanna; And give your selves to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitality,
Rom. 12. 13. Luke 8. 2. 3. Suffer not the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
to lodge without garment, and without covering in

what benefit it will bring to thee, by being boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
to them, thou wilt be glad to meet with, and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:56896:47"/>
invite such an object, or opportunity of doing
good, and be thankful for it; even as <hi>Zerxes</hi> the
<hi>Persian Monarch</hi> said, when <hi>Themistocles</hi> came to
him, being banished his own Countrey; <hi>Let the</hi>
Athenians <hi>send us more of such guests.</hi> And indeed, if
men will not be moved, nor drawn to good with
the threefold cord, <hi>inerrableness of Precepts, innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rableness
of Examples, inestimableness of rewards,</hi> (and
yet here is more then a sevenfold Cord) no hope
that any means should prevail with them, as St.
<hi>Austin</hi> speaks: If <hi>Othniel</hi> be told what preferment
he shall get for taking <hi>Kiriath Sephar,</hi> he will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
that difficult task, <hi>Josh. 15, 16, 17.</hi> And
if <hi>David</hi> does but hear what shall be done to the
man that kills <hi>Goliah,</hi> he dares accept the chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
of that terrible Champion, <hi>1 Sam. 17.</hi> If
<hi>Moses hath</hi> once <hi>respect unto the recompence of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
he will be content to suffer affliction with the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

that the more wee give, the more wee have:

               </gap> shall never want:
If we can no way be so liberal to our selves, as by
giving to the poor, and in them to the possessor of
all things; It should methinks make rich men
of all others, put the same in practice, since
they are all for gain, and looking after commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie;
all for treasuring up, all for themselves, all
for riches, it being their onely <hi>summum bonum;</hi> For
no such way to encrease their Estates, or benefit
themselves, can ever be found out; this wil do it
above what they are able any other way, or what
they were ever yet acquainted with: How then
should it take with them? How should it not whet
them on, and make them put the same in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise?
For should you rich men plot and break
your brains to study and contrive all the dayes of
your lives<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how you may do your selves the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
good, this is the onely way.</p>
            <p>It is fabled of <hi>Midas,</hi> that whatsoever he
touched, it was turned into Gold; but it may
more truly be so said of the hand of Charity; for
that turneth a Cup of cold Water into a never
failing Mine of Gold: As thus; if we but sow the
seed of our Beneficence, we shall not onely reap
an earthly crop, but have also an heavenly har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest,
which wil never fail us; it wil return unto us
a double Harvest, the crop of all temporal and
spiritual benefits in this life, and of everlasting
blessedness in the life to come. This is the true
<hi>Philosophers Stone,</hi> yea it exceeds by far, all that
any report of it. For the Lord will repay and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
us, not onely with the true Treasure of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:56896:48"/>
graces, and eternal glory; but stooping to
our infirmity, even multiply and pay us with our
own mony also, even with the coyn of worldly
blessings, which is so currant among us. And
what greater gain can be imagined, then to
change Earth for Heaven, transitory trifles for
eternal treasures, the bread of men for the bread
of <hi>Angels,</hi> rotten rags for glorious robes, and a
little drink, yea a cup of cold water (if the Well or
River be our best Celler) for the Water of Life,
which will infinitely delight and satisfie us, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
glutting or satiety. Then is our <hi>Saviours</hi>
words, <hi>Luke 12. 33.</hi> worth harkening to of all rich
men, where he saith; <hi>Give alms, provide your selves
bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that
faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupteth.</hi>
And indeed it being so, a man would
think there needed no pressing, or perswading
any to this duty, that have either grace or wit;
for who does not wish well to himself and his?
and yet no duty more neglected; insomuch that
I can never enough admire! the little Charity of
most rich men in these daies, or pity their simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.
For the want of Charity is the strongest
conviction of folly that can be. Nor were it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
they should be so close-fisted, if they were
not as barren of Wit, as they abound in wealth.
As observe but the depth of such an one, he buies
<hi>a Lease of seven years,</hi> with <hi>an Inheritance</hi> that is
<hi>everlasting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There can be nothing more stange in my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
then that covetous men, who are all for
themselves, and for gain, should so neglect the
greatest gain and interest, (with infallible securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:56896:49"/>
that ever was heard of! But <hi>Solomon</hi> gives
the reason, <hi>Prov. 17. 16.</hi> for what he speaks there of
a Fool, is more true of a Covetous &amp; Uncharitable
Rich man; <hi>He hath a price put into his hand, but he

Yea what wil become of most rich men in these

considerable supply? I profess it is wonderful to
me, that ever such fordid, self-lovers, can looke
for, or expect to find the least mercy from <hi>God</hi> at
the great Day of Retribution. Certainly they
must needs think there wil be no such <hi>Day of
Judgement</hi> as <hi>Christ</hi> speaks of, or that he is a noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Lyar, and means not to be as good as his
word; For if they do in the least believe either
of these; yea if they did but come so near belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
as to grant such a thing may be, or it is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
they could not be such careless, witless, and
wicked fools, as to venture and hazard the salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or damnation of their souls, upon the

            <p>O my Brethren! bethink your selves (before
your Glasses be run out) be perswaded, be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
to love your money less, and your selves
and souls more. And do not lose your souls to
save your silver; or if you do, you wil one day
dearly rue it, I mean when you come in <hi>Hell:</hi> As
let me ask your Consciences but this question,
What would you give in those scorching flames to
be delivered out of them, into <hi>Abrahams bosom,</hi> or
the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven?</hi> Yea, what would you
not give, if you then had it? Let <hi>Nabal</hi> be but
ransomed out of <hi>Hell,</hi> he wil no longer be a
<hi>Churl:</hi> Let <hi>Dives</hi> return from that fiery Lake, to
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:56896:50"/>
his former riches, the sensible World shall admire
his Charity. Let <hi>Judas</hi> be ransomed out of Hell,
he wil no more <hi>betray his Master</hi> for money. Let
<hi>Esau</hi> find the same favour, he will never again <hi>sell
his Birth-right. Nabal</hi> then would no longer op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press.
<hi>Achitophel</hi> then wil be no longer <hi>a false-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellor,</hi>
nor <hi>Ahab a bloody Tyrant.</hi> Finally, if all dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
souls could but be admitted to come out of
Hell, and get a promise of Heaven upon conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of extraordinary obedience for a thousand
years, how precisely would they live? And how
would they bestir themselves, that they might
please <hi>God,</hi> having once tasted of those torments
which now many are in doubt of, because no man
ever saw Hell, that returned back to make the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation?
yea, if the offer were but made to these
Churls on their death-beds, when <hi>Conscience</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to <hi>accuse, God</hi> appears to be <hi>angry,</hi> and <hi>Satan</hi>
is ready to <hi>seize upon their souls,</hi> they would then
give all they have, had they ten thousand worlds,
for a short reprieve, to the end they might have
the like possibility; As certainly, when <hi>Pharoah</hi>
saw the <hi>Sea</hi> ready to <hi>swallow him;</hi> he was heartily
sorry that ever he had wronged poor innocents,
and <hi>oppressed God's own portion:</hi> How much more,
when he felt the flames of Hell-fire about his ears?
And the like of <hi>Ahab,</hi> touching <hi>Naboth,</hi> and all
such covetous and cruel men. What gained <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban,</hi>
and <hi>Nabal,</hi> or <hi>Dives,</hi> or that <hi>rich man in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,</hi>
by heaping up Riches, and ingrossing all to
themselves, when shortly after by their covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and cruelty, they both lost their Estates, and
themselves? <hi>The foolish Virgins</hi> to save, or spare a

a shilling, brought no <hi>Oyle;</hi> but when their <hi>Lamps</hi>
were out, and the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> was come, what
would they have given? Yea, what would they
not have given for a little Oyle, and for entrance
with <hi>the wise,</hi> into the <hi>Wedding?</hi> Such will on:
day be the case of all covetous men: Indeed at
present none are wise but they; for they account
poor honesty but a kind of simplicity; but then
they wil acknowledge themselves to have been of
all fools, the greatest; nor deserve they any pity:
Who pities that man's death, that having the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine

            <p>FOurthly, If there needs no other ground of
our last and heaviest doom, than, <hi>Ye have not
given, Ye have not visited:</hi> If the main point which
<hi>Christ</hi> wil scan at the day of Judgement, is the
point of mercy. If he wil accuse the Wicked at
the last day, not onely for taking the meat out of
the poors mouths, or plucking their apparel off
their backs; but for not feeding them, and putting
cloaths upon their backs, as is evident by <hi>Matth.</hi>
25. and as I have made plain; then are all <hi>Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Christians</hi> in an ill taking.</p>
            <p>It is strange to see how many several ways men
have to deceive themselves: One thinks it enough
that he is of the <hi>outward visible Church, born of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Parents,</hi> hath been <hi>baptized, &amp;c.</hi> Another so
confidently hopes for <hi>Salvation by Faith,</hi> that he
<hi>little regards honesty,</hi> or true dealing <hi>amongst men.</hi>
Another sort flatter themselves with promises of
mercy; as, <hi>Christ suffered for all; God would have all to
be saved; At what time soever a sinner repents, he shall
be forgiven,</hi> and the like; and with these they bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
their own presumptuous confidence, be their
lives never so licentious. Yea where is the man
that wil not boast of his love to <hi>Christ?</hi> though
they even hate all that any way resemble him; but
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:56896:51"/>
of all others, such as live harmless Lives, and do
no hurt, think it sufficient, and that it greatly
matters not for doing good, so they do no evil.
And in these conceits they go on to the end of
their lives, without once questioning how they
shal enter in at the straight Gate. Their deceitful
hearts serve them as <hi>Jael</hi> did <hi>Sizera,</hi> who flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
said to him, <hi>Come in my Lord,</hi> giving him Milk,
and covering him with a Mantle, but withal, nail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his head to the ground. As see how the <hi>Rich
Glutton</hi> flattered himself with hopes, until he was
in Hel-flames: For notwithstanding he had deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>poor Lazarus the very crumbs that fell from his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
yet he could <hi>challenge Abraham for his Father,</hi>
saying, <hi>Father Abraham have mercy on me, &amp;c.</hi> Luk. 16
But refused he was, because he had not the <hi>works,</hi>
nor indeed the <hi>Faith of Ahraham,</hi> though he might
seem to profess and pretend it. And the like of
those <hi>Jews, John 8.</hi> For they could boast to <hi>Christ,</hi>
that <hi>Abraham was their Father;</hi> but he gave them a
cutting Answer, <hi>If ye were Abraham's Children, ye
would do the works of Abraham, ver. 39.</hi> Vainly do
they speak of their love to Christ, who yet are
wanting to his members. Neither can there be
a truer argument of a godless person, then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifulness:
If we know a man <hi>unmerciful,</hi> we
may boldly say, He is <hi>ungodly, John 3. 17. The lack
of Charity, is the conviction of Hypocrisie,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.
1, 2, <hi>&amp;c. The righteous is merciful, and giveth, Psal.</hi>
37. 21, 22. But the Wicked are so far from this that
<hi>they borrow, and pay not again.</hi> The Father of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
hath no Children but the merciful, <hi>Matth. 5.
7.</hi> He that is not a <hi>feeling. Member</hi> of others mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:56896:52"/>
is not of that <hi>Mystical Body,</hi> whereof <hi>Christ
is the Head.</hi> It is not who is called a <hi>Christian,</hi> or
who is <hi>baptized;</hi> for in that number we shall find a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of <hi>Hereticks,</hi> no fewer <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> and
inn imerable <hi>ungodly persons;</hi> some <hi>not informed
in their Judgements,</hi> the rest <hi>not reformed in their lives;</hi>
Neither is it enough that we are civil honest men
whom none can justly accuse; for we are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 11. to <hi>eschue evil, and</hi> to <hi>do good;</hi> to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chue
evil, is the first lesson of Christianity, but not
all; to do good is the second, and greater half,
<hi>2 Tim. 2. 19. Let every one that calls on the Name of the
Lord, depart from iniquity;</hi> that is one step, but not
high enough; We must also <hi>do the will of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
John 7. 17. Every Tree that brings not forth good
fruit,</hi> (for all it brings forth no bad) <hi>shall be cut
down for the Fire;</hi> And the <hi>servant that doth not</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
and <hi>increase his Talent,</hi> (for all he returns it
safe and whole to his Master) <hi>shall be bound hand and
foot, and cast into utter darkness, Matth. 25. 30.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thou hast a servant who is neither Thiefe nor
Drunkard, nor Swearer; no, none is able to tax
him with any vice or unthriftiness; yet because he
sits all day with his hand in his bosom, and does
nothing, thou correctest him: Why what harm
hath he done? Thou canst not charge him with
any thing but his not doing of something, yet he
deserves chastisement: So in this case there needs
no more to prove thee wicked, and to make thee
of the number of those <hi>Goats</hi> which <hi>shall be placed
at Christ's left hand,</hi> and to whom <hi>he shall say, Depart
ye cursed,</hi> then that thou hast not done these works
of mercy, which are no less commanded, then the
wickedst actions are forbidden.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:56896:52"/>
Good deeds are such, that no man is saved for
them, nor without them. Indeed <hi>Faith</hi> is the
life of a Christian; but the breath whereby he is
known to live, is <hi>Charity, 1 Cor. 13. 3. Faith doth ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie,
our works do testifie that we are justified:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
justifie thy Faith, that thy Faith may justifie
thee. There is much Faith talked of, but little
faithfulness manifested; abundance of love, but
not a spark of Charity, <hi>Gal. 5. 22.</hi> But let men
pretend what they wil, he that hath Grace, or the
love of <hi>God</hi> in his heart, wil shew it in Works of
mercy, to the end, that <hi>God</hi> may be honored, and
<hi>others won and edified</hi> thereby. <hi>Blessed are the pure in
heart,</hi> faith <hi>our Saviour, for they shall see God, Matth.
5. 8.</hi> They must lead vertuous lives on <hi>Earth,</hi> that
ever expect <hi>in Heaven</hi> to see the <hi>Lord Jesus.</hi> Now
the inward disposition of the heart is outwardly
ingraven in the life. <hi>Shew methy faith by thy works,</hi>
sayes <hi>James, Jam. 2. 18.</hi> That is, by thy <hi>active obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
which consisteth in <hi>doing God's Commandments;</hi>
and <hi>passive obedience, in suffering his Chastisements.</hi>
Though Faith be alone in Justification, yet not in
the justified; as the Eye, though alone in seeing,
yet not in him that seeth, but joined with the
Ears, Nose, Hands, and many other members of
the body.</p>
            <p>Faith the Queen of Graces, hath her Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-Usher
before, and her Servants following af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
If you see not Repentance go before Faith;
nor Works attending on her: know that it is not
she. There is <hi>a zeal without knowledge,</hi> and there is
<hi>a knowledge without zeal;</hi> there is <hi>a faith without obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi>
and there is <hi>an obedience without faith;</hi> there
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:56896:53"/>
is <hi>a love without fear,</hi> &amp; there is <hi>a fear without love;</hi> &amp;
<hi>both</hi> are <hi>hypocrites. We are justified by faith,</hi> sayes <hi>Paul,
Rom. 4. 3. We are justified by works,</hi> says <hi>James, Jam. 2. 21
St. James</hi> dealt with them that stood too much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Faith without Works, <hi>S. Paul</hi> dealt with them
that stood too much upon Works without Faith.</p>
            <p>Wirked men, if we mark it, are all for extreams,
and extreams onely bear rule in this World, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there is still but <hi>one virtue for two vices,</hi> which
cowch so close beside her, that the natural man
can scarce see her; as for instance, you shall ever
see <hi>Pride on the one side, Rusticity on the other side, and
comeliness in the midst; Flattery on the one side, Malice
on the other side,</hi> and <hi>Love in the midst: Diffidence on
the one side, Presumption on the other side,</hi> and <hi>Faith in
the midst. Superstition on the one side, Atheism on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side,</hi> and <hi>Religion in the midst: Ignorance on the
one side, Curiosity on the other side,</hi> and <hi>knowledge in
the midst: Carefulness on the one side, Carelesness on the
other side, and Diligence in the midst: Covetousness on the
one side, Prodigallity on the other side,</hi> and <hi>Frugallity in
the midst.</hi> But to these Virtues, or to keep the
mean, Worldlings are always to seek, as hereafter
they wil be of a blessing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gods Servants</hi> are known by this, they square all
their actions and intentions by the Rule of the
Word, as knowing that if they do never so much
to satisfie anothers Will, or their own, it avails
nothing with <hi>God,</hi> if it be not done for <hi>God.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>David</hi> prayes, <hi>Teach me O Lord, to do thy will,</hi>
not my Will; for we need not be taught to do our
own wills; every man can go to <hi>Hell</hi> without a
Guide. Now he that wil do <hi>Gods Will,</hi> and live by
the direct Rule of his Word, must <hi>repent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56896:53"/>
the Gospel, Mark 1. 15.</hi> that is, joyn with his

            <p>And altbeit in our Justification, Christ saith,

to the Faith, Matth 9. 29.</hi> Yet in our salvation, <hi>Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditur
unicuique secundum opera sua; Every man shall
be rewarded according to his works, Matth. 16. 27.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wil <hi>Christ</hi> say when he shal sit upon his throne,
Ye have believed, but you have done; Come ye
blessed, <hi>Matth. 25. 35.</hi> and in <hi>Matth. 25. 21. Well

Rule, <hi>Gal. 6. 16.</hi> And <hi>as many as walk according
to this Rnle, peace shall be upon them, and mercy, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Israel of God.</hi> Again, it is not knowing, or
hearing, or preaching, or casting out Devils in
<hi>Christs</hi> Name, nor praying, <hi>Lord, Lord, &amp;c. but he
that doth his will;</hi> and when he hath done it,
accounts himself an uprofitable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

believe <hi>God's</hi> Word; It were impossible they should

since the scripture thoroughout continually calls

If you <hi>ask God who shall dwell in his holy Mountain,</hi>
he faith, <hi>The man which walketh uprightly, Psal.</hi> 15. 2.
If ye ask <hi>Christ who shall enter into the Kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi>
he saith, Not they which cry, Lord, Lord,
(though they cry twice Lord) but <hi>they which do
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:56896:54"/>
the will of my Father, Mat. 7. 22.</hi> If you ask him again,
How you may come to Heaven; he saith, <hi>Keep the
Commandments, Luk. 18. 20.</hi> If you ask him again,
<hi>Who are blessed?</hi> He saith, <hi>Blessed are they that hear the
Word of God, and do it;</hi> here are none but doers. If
you <hi>ask an Angel,</hi> who are blessed? he saith, <hi>Blessed
are they which keep the words of this Book Revel. 22. 7.</hi>
Here are none but doers. If you ask <hi>David</hi> Who
are blessed? He saith, <hi>Blessed are they that keep judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and he that doth righteousness, Psal. 106. 3. &amp; 103.
18.</hi> If you ask <hi>Solomon,</hi> Who are blessed? He faith,
<hi>The man is blessed that keepeth God's Law. Prov. 29. 18.</hi>
Here are none but doers. If you ask <hi>Esay,</hi> Who are
blessed? He saith, <hi>He which doth this, is blessed, Esay
56. 2.</hi> If you ask St. <hi>James,</hi> Who are blessed? He
saith, <hi>The doer of the Word is blessed in his deed, James
1. 25.</hi> Here is none but doers mentioned, <hi>Matth. 7,
21. Rom. 2. 13.</hi> So that blessedness and doing, go
always together; For as <hi>the works that Christ did,
bore witness that he was Christ, Job. 10. 25. So the works
that we do, must bear witness that we are Christians.</hi> And
least any man should look to be blessed without o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
as <hi>Christ</hi> calleth <hi>Love the greatest Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment;</hi>
so <hi>Solomon</hi> calleth <hi>Obedience the end of all;</hi>
as though without obedience all were to no end,
<hi>Eccles. 12. 13.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>When God created the Trees in Paradice, Gen. 1. hee
commanded them to bring forth fruit:</hi> So when he crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
a lively faith in any one, he commandeth it
to bring forth Works. And when our <hi>Saviour</hi>
would prove himself to <hi>John,</hi> to be the true <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias</hi>
indeed; he said to his Disciples, <hi>Tell John what
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:56896:54"/>
what things you have heard and seen;</hi> not only heard,
but seen, <hi>Matth. 11. 4.</hi> So if we will prove our
selves to be <hi>Christs Disciples</hi> indeed, we must do
that which may be seen, as wel as heard. <hi>Iohn</hi> was
not onely called <hi>the Voyce of a Cryer,</hi> but a <hi>Burning
Lamp,</hi> which might be seen.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>James</hi> doth not say, Let me hear thy Faith; but
let me see thy Faith: As the <hi>Angels</hi> put on the
shape of men, that <hi>Abraham</hi> might see them; so
Faith must put on Works, that the World may
see it. <hi>The works which I do,</hi> says <hi>Christ, bear witness
of me.</hi> And he alwayes linketh Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
together; <hi>Repent and believe the Gospel, Mark
1. 15.</hi> Therefore that which <hi>Christ</hi> hath joined, let
no man separate, <hi>Mark 10. 9.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know the <hi>Antinomians</hi> preach another <hi>Gospel;</hi>
but this is the <hi>old Orthodox &amp; common received truth:</hi>
They that in life wil yeild no <hi>obedience to the Law,</hi>
shall in death have no <hi>benefit by the Gospel.</hi> And
though the Law have no power to condemn us,
yet it hath power to command us: <hi>Lex datur ut
gratia quaereretur, Evangelium, ut Lex impleretur. The
Law sends us to Christ to be saved; and Christ sends us back
again to the law to learn obedience.</hi> The former is plain;
<hi>The Law is our School-Master to bring us to Christ,</hi> that
we might be justified by faith, <hi>Gal. 3. 24.</hi> The other
is as manifest; <hi>If thou wilt enter into life, keep the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,
Matth. 19. 17.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let <hi>our Faith</hi> then be seen by <hi>our faithfulness,</hi> and
our <hi>Love</hi> by our <hi>Charity:</hi> and think not to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of what <hi>God hath promised,</hi> but by doing in
some measure <hi>what he hath commanded.</hi> To conclude
in a word, <hi>God's servants</hi> are known, <hi>by humility</hi> and

               <hi>charity;</hi> the <hi>Devil's</hi> by <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>cruelty.</hi> Our <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>

<hi>What I have is mine own:</hi> Or, <hi>May I not
do as I list with mine own;</hi> for it is neither their own,
nor at their own disposing; their wealth is their
Makers, and they must do with it as he in his

            <p>Nor does this argument alwayshold goodin civil
matters: 'Tis <hi>a rule in Law,</hi> No man may use his
<hi>own right</hi> to the <hi>Common-wealths wrong,</hi> or damage.
The <hi>Law</hi> provides, that a man shall <hi>not burn his own

            <p>Wherefore flatter thy self no longer, but lookto
it: thou hast not <hi>two souls,</hi> that thou mightst <hi>hazard
one</hi> of them. Lose not thy soul, to save thy purse;
but shew mercy, if ever thou lookest to find any.
And hear the poor, if ever thou wilt have <hi>God</hi> to
hear thee: For he hath said it, (that will one
day Audit the poor man's complaints, and thy
Stewardships account) that no sin but unkindness
to thy Saviour in his suffering members, shall bee

good uses, especially for relieving Christ's poore
members.</p>
            <p>Will this Bill pass current, when God comes to
cast it up? When thou hast laid out all for thy

fare? If these accounts bee not mended in this

these, <hi>viz.</hi> Such as are not only strangers unto

Sixtly &amp; lastly, He would have thee of his Court
by <hi>Glorification,</hi> that he might crown thee. So that
thou art every way his. Yea, he hath removed

            <p>NInthly, Is it so, that what we give here to
<hi>Christ's</hi> poor members, we shall receive again
in Heaven with ten thousand, thousand fold
increase of <hi>God</hi> himself; What wise man then
wil not disburse a good part of his Estate, even
as much as he can well spare, this way, when it
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:56896:58"/>
will bring in such benefit? Yea, one would think
the more covetous men are, and the more they
love their money, the more liberal and bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
this should make them. Some love their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
so well, that they would, if possible, carry in
with them when they dye; If so, this is the only
way: The onely means to have the fruit and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of our riches for ever, is to send them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us into our <hi>Heavenly Countrey,</hi> where we shall
have our everlasting habitation: Nor can we car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
any more of our Wealth with us, then what we
thus lay out; for these earthly things are lost by
<hi>keeping,</hi> and <hi>kept by bestowing.</hi> Neither can they
and we long continue together, seeing either they
will leave us in our life time, or we shall leave
them at the hour of death, when all that we pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess
shall be left behind us, and that onely shal be
our own, which we have sent before us. In which
respect our riches are fitly compared unto <hi>Seed,</hi>
which can no other ways be truly kept, then when
we seem utterly to lose it; for if we keep it in our
<hi>Garners,</hi> it will either be spent in the use, or in
time must corrupt and perish; but if we cast it <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the ground,</hi> where it seemeth to rot, and to be
lost, it is the onely way to preserve and keepe it
from losing &amp; perishing. Give then that which
you can no otherwise keep, that you may receive
that which you can never loose; for to part with
that which you cannot keepe, that you may get
that you cannot loose, is a good bargain.</p>

where thou art ever to reside; let thy Goods bee
where thy Countrey is: Let us imitate herein <hi>wise
Travellers,</hi> who being <hi>in a strange</hi> and dangerous
<hi>Countrey,</hi> will not carry their Riches and Treasures
about them, because they be then in danger by
thieves and enemies, to be spoiled of them, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarding
also therewith the loss of their lives, but
deliver them rather to the <hi>Agents and Factors</hi> of
sufficient <hi>Merchants,</hi> dwelling in their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
that so taking from them <hi>Bills of Exchange,</hi>
they may receive them at their coming home. The
best means of transporting them thither is, to
put thy money into the <hi>Lords Treasury,</hi> to deliver
it unto the <hi>poor,</hi> who like <hi>trusty Porters,</hi> will carry
it for us; whereas if we carry it our selves, it will
like heavy burthens, hinder our journey, &amp; like
the Camels Bunch, keepe us from entering into
the straight Gate, whereas if the poor whom <hi>God</hi>
hath appointed for this service, carry it for us, we
shall avoid the trouble, and escape this danger.</p>
            <p>Our Wealth can never do us so much good, as
when it helps us in our way to <hi>Heaven,</hi> where
there is no use of such transitory things; for there
the valuation of Gold ceaseth, Riches are of no
use there; and in <hi>Hell</hi> it was a drop of water that
the <hi>Churl</hi> wished for; not a Bag of Gold, nor a
Lordship of many Acres, he had too large an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
of them before: Wherefore ye rich men,
yea all men to the utmost of your ability, <hi>do that
good before death, which may do you good after death,</hi> as
<hi>Austin</hi> speaks; put a good part of your Goods (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
as much as you can wel spare from your own
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:56896:59"/>
use, and for the well furnishing of your Journey)
into the hands of the poor, whom <hi>Christ</hi> hath
appointed as his <hi>Agents</hi> and <hi>Factors,</hi> and so it shall
most surely be repaid, with infinite encrease (here
if we need it; however) having finished our Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage,
and safely arrived at our heavenly
home, when Death hath spoiled us of all the rest,
we shall most richly be provided. And this is the
right course to <hi>make us friends of the unrighteous
Mammon,</hi> unto which <hi>our Saviour</hi> perswadeth us,
<hi>Luke</hi> 16. 9. This is to play the <hi>wise Stewards,</hi> that
when by <hi>Death</hi> we are thrust out of our Steward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
we having discreetly laid out our Master's
Goods, may be joyfully received into those ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
<hi>Habitations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor will it so much grieve a good man (at the
upshot of all; that he hath been a <hi>poor Treasurer,</hi>
as joy him that he hath been a <hi>good Steward:</hi> Yea,
it will be the sweetest and joyfullest saying that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
our ears did hear, when <hi>Christ</hi> shall say to us,
as you heard before, <hi>Come ye blessed of my Father,
and inherit the Kingdom, &amp;c.</hi> This will far more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice
thy soul, then it does now refresh the others
body.</p>
            <p>Again, Is there any place so safe as <hi>Heaven?
where no thief comes,</hi> where no Plunderer comes,
where no rust comes: Is there any place like that?
Or can you put it into a better and safer hand,
then into the hands of <hi>God</hi> himself? If then you
wil lay it where you may be sure to have it forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming,
put it into <hi>Gods</hi> hand, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ay it up in <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
But if thou wilt not, or if contrariwise, thy
onely care is to hoard up Riches upon the earth,
this does plainly shew, that this World is thy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive

            <p>BUt many to save their purses, will object, that
they are poor themselves, and have nothing
to spare them when they want relief: And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them speak more truly then they are aware;
for though they abound with earthly Riches, yet
are they bare and beggarly in respect of the chief
riches, and spiritual Treasure; though they are
<hi>rich in goods,</hi> yet are they <hi>poor in Grace, poor in Love
towards God, and their Neighbours; poor in Faith and
Obedience,</hi> and <hi>poor in Pity, Mercy and Compassion</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
their Brethren, which makes them so nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardly
and close handed, that they wil part with
nothing for their relief. They have not for the
poor, a few scraps to preserve them from perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with hunger; but they have enough for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to pamper their bellies, and with the <hi>Rich
Glutton,</hi> to <hi>fare deliciously every day:</hi> They have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to entertain their rich friends with super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous
pomp and plenty; and they, they will not
leave to their own appetite, but press them with
their importunity, to eat still more, when alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
they have eaten enough, and too much; but
to the poore they will not allow some poor pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
to keep them from famishing. They who
make no spare of their most costly Wines, but
swallow them down themselves with great excess,
and provoke, yea even compel others to drink of
them unto drunkenness, will not give a little
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:56896:60"/>
small drink to the poor members of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi>
to quench their thirst; they have not for the poor
some worn and cast Apparel, to cover their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness,
and keep their bodies from the injuries
of Wind and Weather; but they have enough
not onely for their own use, but also for pride
and ostentation, their Chests full thrust with rich
Clothing, and their Wardrobes thorowly furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
with gorgeous Garments, which serve for
little other use, then to keepe those from sloath
and idleness, that keep them from moulding and
Moth-eating: And whereas they have no course
Clothes to cover naked <hi>Christ,</hi> they have costly
Ornaments of <hi>Arras</hi> and <hi>Tapastry,</hi> for their walls.
Finally, They have not a few pence to spare for
the relieving of naked and hungry <hi>Christ,</hi> be hee
in never so extream necessity; but they have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
shillings and pounds to spend wastfully
and riotously upon Dicing and Gaming, vain
Sights, and obscene Stage-playes, and so upon
all other sinful pleasures and worldly delights,
which their carnal appetites can any way desire.</p>
            <p>But what a fearful reckoning have these men to
make at the day of Judgement, when they give in
their accounts unto God? And with what indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
will <hi>Christ</hi> look upon them, who have thus
meanly and basely regarded him. Then they wil
have the wit (or cause) to wish that they had not
thus occasioned <hi>Christ</hi> to deal with them, as they
have dealt with him and his. But <hi>there is no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading
them to believe, that are ordained to perish.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But say thou hast but a small pittance of this

               </gap>s goods, and not such plenty or superflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
as is before spoken of; yet oughtest thou out of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:56896:61"/>
that little thou hast, to spare somewhat to relieve
those that are in extream necessity, either by sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
what thou canst spare; or if thou hast nothing
to sell, yet God commandeth thee, rather then
thou shouldest neglect these Works of Mercy; to
<hi>labour with thy hands, that thou mayest have to give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him that needeth, Epbes. 4. 28.</hi> And therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
not thy neglect of this duty by saying that
thou hast nothing for them, unless thou hast no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to waste upon thy superfluous vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
nothing to sell; unless thou art unable by thy
honest labour, to earn thy living, and art thy self
such an one, as needeth by others to be relieved:
that the poorest are not exempted from this duty,
we may see in the example of the <hi>poor Widow,</hi> who
was so commended by our <hi>Saviour</hi> for <hi>casting into
the Treasury her two mites, which was all her substance,
Mark 12. 43.</hi> In the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> who being them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
poor, gave even above their ability to the
relief of those that were poorer, <hi>2 Cor. 8. 2.</hi> In the
<hi>Apostles, Acts 3. 6.</hi> and in <hi>our Saviour Christ</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
who though he were so poore, that he lived
upon what others out of their love and duty mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred
unto him, as appears <hi>Luke 8. 3.</hi> yet he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
gave Alms to those who were in greater want,
as we may gather <hi>John 12. 6. 8.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, if we did indeed rightly consider it, our
small means should move us the rather to give,
and the more carefully to exercise this Christian
duty, since this is the means whereby being poor,
we may become richer, as I have plentifully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in <hi>the Prevention of Poverty, Chap. 30.</hi> which I
may not stand to repeat. <hi>See Prov. 3. 9, 10, &amp; 11.
24, 25. &amp; 28. 27. Psal. 112. 3. Isa. 32. 8. Luke 6. 38.
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:56896:61"/>
2 Cor. 9. 6.</hi> Which Scriptures shew, that giving to
the poor does not weaken, but much strengthen
our Estates, and is so far from being the cause of
our want and poverty, that it is the onely means
to keep us from it, and bring to us plenty and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance.</p>
            <p>Besides, if having little we are content in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to <hi>God,</hi> to part with somewhat, we perform
a duty the more acceptable to <hi>God,</hi> and in the day
of <hi>Christ's</hi> appearing we shal be so much the more
richly rewarded; and for the present, our Work
will be so much the more commendable, as wee
may see, <hi>Mark 12. 43. 2 Cor. 8. 2.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither are we to imagine, that if we be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in feeding <hi>Christ,</hi> that he will be careless in
feeding us; that he will deny us meat, who hath
given us his precious blood; that he will suffer us

let us believe <hi>God, under hope, above hope;</hi> that is,
when in respect of humane means and second

are miserable having Wife and Children, would
not be liberal if they were without them. Again,

that thou mightest make them a Plea and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
to neglect his Commandments, and thy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

fear, if thou thus abusest the blessing of posterity,

thou makest <hi>Idols</hi> of them, loving them better
then <hi>God</hi> who gave them.</p>
            <p>But thy Children are dear unto thee, and must

            <p>But I may answer thee in thine own words; <hi>He

If thou art a Believer, <hi>Christ's</hi> Family is thy
Family, <hi>Epth. 3. 15. Heb. 2. 11, 13, 14, 16, 17.</hi> They

of our Brethren pertain to our selves:
Men do well to provide for their Wife and Babes,
but not then when the present necesstities of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
cannot be supplyed, without the same bee
lessened. How did they in the <hi>second and fourth</hi> of
the <hi>Acts,</hi> provide for their Families, Wives and
Children, when they <hi>sold their Houses and Lands,
and gave away all the money?</hi> Were they worse then
<hi>Infidels,</hi> because they were more careful to supply
the present wants of the Saints, then to provide
for themselves, Wives and Children, <hi>2 Cor, 8. 14.
Acts 4. 34, 35, 36, 37.</hi> The <hi>Psalmist</hi> speaking of the
wicked, says, <hi>They leave their substance to their Babes,
Psal. 17. 14.</hi> They put Wife and Children into
their Wills, but leave out <hi>Christ</hi> and his Children,
because they love Wife and Children more then

But lastly, let men leave to their Children ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so great Estates, they shall be never the better
for thein, if they have not the blessing of God
withal: And is it likely that he wil bless unto
them thine Estate, which is gotten and raked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
by unjust keeping that which he hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined
thee to bestow; and by the utter neglect
and contempt of his Commandment? Or that
God will regard and feed thy Children, who hast
neglected his, and suffered them to pine and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
for want of Relief? No, the onely means to
obtain <hi>God's</hi> blessing upon thy self and thy poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
is to obey his Commandments, to trust him
upon his word, &amp; to give liberally unto the poor;
for the righteous man, who is merciful and lend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
not onely himself, but his seed also is blessed,
<hi>Psal. 37. 26.</hi> He doth not say, That his children shal
live in a rich and pompous Estate, for so they
may do, and yet with the <hi>rich Glutton,</hi> be everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
condemned; yea, they may be wasters and
prodigals, who wil wickedly and riotously spend
what thou hast as wickedly gotten and reserved;
yea, it may be this Worldly Wealth which thou
leavesh them, may be the means of furthering
and encreasing their everlasting ruine, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
condemnation: As how commonly does the
leaving great Estates to children (which the rich
Father minds not) make them so much the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
sinners, and to spend their dayes in pride, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
idleness, uncleanness, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

shal have <hi>Gods</hi> blessing upon that which they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy,
which whether it be less or more, wil make
it sufficient, and so sanctifie it to their use, that
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:56896:63"/>
it shal be unto them a pledge of <hi>God's</hi> love, and a
pawn or earnest penny of their eternal salvation.
Whereas if we will not so far forth trust <hi>God,</hi> as we
would one another; if we will give nothing for
<hi>God's</hi> and for <hi>Christ's</hi> sake, who have given us our
selves, and all we have: just it is he should suffer

            </p>
            <p>As without <hi>God's</hi> special Providence, Blessing,
and gracious Guidance, thine and their Estates
is subject to such innumerable casualties, that our
of the highest flow of plenty; they may easily be
brought to as great an ebb of want and penury.
They may be oppressed by those who are more

and supplant: there may some crack or flaw be
found in their Title; and so for want of words
or letters to carry it, thy Children may be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of the benefit of thy care and providence.
But if <hi>God</hi> take the care and charge over them,

            <p>BUt admit wee were assured, that the goods
which we spare from the relief of the poor,
and leave to our children, should prosper with
them, and make them great on the earth; yet
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:56896:64"/>
were there no reason, why for this we should neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
these works of mercy: For why shouldst thou
love thy children better then thine own person,
and in providing for them, neglect thy self? Yea,
why shouldst thou prefer their Wealth before
thine own soul? and their flourishing Estate in
the World, which is but momentary and muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
before the fruition of those joys which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
and everlasting? What comfort wil it be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thee, if for getting some trifles for thy posterity
on Earth, thou hast lost <hi>Heaven?</hi> or to remember
that thy children ruffle it out in worldly wealth,
and superfluous abundance, when thou shalt be
stripped of all, and want a drop of cold water to
cool thy scorching heat.</p>
            <p>But this is the case, (with which I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude:)
First, the gain of giving is inestima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
<hi>God</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi> who are owners of the whole
World, hath promised we shall be repaid with the
increase of an hundred fold here, and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand,
thousand fold in <hi>Heaven,</hi> and that our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
and posterity shall reap the fruits of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence.
And</p>
            <p>Secondly, The security is beyond all excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
for we have <hi>God's</hi> Word and Hand-writing
for it, even express <hi>Testimonies, Precepts,</hi> and <hi>Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
out of <hi>both Testaments;</hi> who is so true of his
word, that he never failed a tittle in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
thereof, and also all-sufficient to perform:
<hi>Nihil promittit, &amp; non reddit; fidelis ille factus est debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
esto tu avarus exactor,</hi> as <hi>Austin</hi> on <hi>Psal. 32.</hi> Only
herein lyes the defect, in this <hi>Atheistical</hi> age, most
men believe not that there is a God; or if so, they
wil not, or dare not trust him so far as they would
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:56896:64"/>
do a man whom they take to be able and honest.
This must of necessity be the main and only rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why men are no more liberal to the poor: As
for instance, If a man of Worship or Credit should,
speak or write to one of us, and wish us to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burse
such, or such a sum of money to the poore
about us, and he would take it as his own Debt,
and not onely pay it us again, but take it as a
great favour; We would willingly do it without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
reluctancy, yea rather then fail, we would
borrow it, though we had our selves many chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
yea, there is no man when he sows his
ground, thinks that it is lost and cast away, or so
buryed in the Earth, that he shal never see it more:
No, he lookes that that should bring him in a
great deal more, and pay him with overplus, for
all his cost; and this hope makes him prodigal of
his Seed, so that it shal have as much by his good
wil, as the ground can bear or bring forth: And
does not this plainly prove, that we wil give cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
to a man's Word or Bond; yea, that we wil
trust the very ground itself, rather then take <hi>God's</hi>
or <hi>Christ's Bond,</hi> or the <hi>Bible-Security?</hi> You know
the place wel enough, where <hi>God</hi> hath given his
<hi>Bill</hi> to you, for the re-payment of what you
give to the poor, <hi>Prov. 19. 17. He that giveth to the
poor, lendeth to the Lord; and that which he hath given,
he will repay him again,</hi> Lo brethren, the bil of <hi>Gods</hi>
own hand (as I may call it) in which he hath
both acknowledged the Debt, and promised pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Be it known unto all men by this present
promise, That I the <hi>Lord God of Heaven &amp; Earth,</hi>
do won and acknowledge my self to be indebted
to every merciful or liberal man, all those sums of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:56896:65"/>
money which he hath bestowed, or shal bestow in
relieving the distressed, to be paid back unto him
whensoever he shal demand it, (for a <hi>Bond</hi> or <hi>Bill</hi>
that names no day of payment, binds to pay it
at demand) and to this payment wel and truly
to be paid, I bind my self firmly by this present
promise, sent, sealed and delivered by <hi>Solomon</hi> my
known <hi>Secretary</hi> or <hi>Scribe.</hi> So that not to give rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
upon this consideration, is to proclaim the
<hi>Lord</hi> an insufficient or a dishonest Pay-Master; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that we do not believe <hi>God</hi>'s Promises, nor
give that credit unto him on his Word, which we
would give to a <hi>Turk</hi> or <hi>Infidel</hi> dwelling among
us; or that we do not esteem the payment of his
<hi>spiritual Grace,</hi> or <hi>Heavenly Glory</hi> (vvhich toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vvith pecuniary pay, is super-added) for
current money, or of equal value to these tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitory
trifles, which we impart unto the poor; for
if a man of any credit should promise for the
laying out of an hundred pounds, that we should
have Annuity of a hundred pounds a yeare, for
term of life; how eagerly would we catch at such
an offer, though the quick approach of Death
might make us loosers by the bargain? But <hi>God</hi>
promiseth, that if we wil lay out our money on
these uses, wee shal have an hundred for one of
these Earthly trifles, together with Spiritual, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly,
&amp; everlasting Treasures to boot, in the Life
to come. So that it is undeniable, if we do not
obey the Precept of God herein, we charge <hi>God</hi>
with flat falshood: For consider, <hi>God</hi> saith he wil
repay it; thou saist, He wil not. He saith, That to
give, is the onely vvay to have, and to grovv rich;
yea, never to want, nor to have thy Children
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:56896:65"/>
want: Thou sayst, if I give so much, I shal never
be rich, yea I shal be a Beggar. What is this, but
to give God the Lie, and to make the excuse worse
then the fault.</p>
            <p>For shame then, let us acknowledge the suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency,
and faithfulness of <hi>God:</hi> and go away assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that he wil abundantly perform more then
we can imagine, according to the riches of his
grace, in <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> Nor can we doubt, but <hi>God</hi>
is as good a Debtor, as a giver; for if he freely
give us wherewithal to lend, and grace to give, he
wil much more pay us what we have lent, and give
us because we have given: that is his Bounty, this
his Justice. As what says Saint <hi>Paul? God is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous,
that he should forget your work and labour of
love, which ye shewed towards his Name; in that ye have
ministred unto the Saints, and yet minister.</hi> As if hee
should say, that <hi>God</hi> were unrighteous, if he should
do so, <hi>Heb. 6. 10.</hi> Dost thou then love thy mony?
and wouldst thou have it increased? Deliver it
not into the hands of men (saith Saint <hi>Austin</hi>)
who wil rejoice when they borrow, and mourn
when they repay it: intreat, that they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive;
and calumniate when they should restore:
who may be bankrupt and cannot, or deceitful
and wil not pay; or who wil put thee off with
many delays, and trouble thee with expecting, as
they have formerly troubled thee with their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
in borrowing. But if thou be a wise U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer,
chuse <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> for thy Debtors; who
are owners of the whole world, and all-sufficient
sureties (not subject to any casualties) and just
beyond all exceptions, or comparison. <hi>Nihil pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittit
&amp; non reddit, fidelis ille factus est debitor, esto tu
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:56896:66"/>
dvarus exactor,</hi> at <hi>Austin</hi> on <hi>Psalm</hi> 32. And as the
payment is most assured, so the gain is inestima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
so that we cannot lay up our wealth in a
safer, or better hand: we cannot have a better
<hi>Debtor</hi> then our <hi>Maker;</hi> nor a better <hi>Bond</hi> then the
<hi>Bible, Prov.</hi> 19. 17. <hi>Luk.</hi> 6. 35.</p>

         <div n="62" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. LXII.</head>
            <p>BUt thou seest not this increase in thy worldly
estate by giving Alms, nor dost thou perceive,
that it brings thee any such blessedness as hath
been talked of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer,</hi> This Objection makes me conclude,
that thou art a Miser, and deservest not the name
of an Alms-giver: or if so, let me add, that if thou
believest no more then thou seest, why dost thou
take upon thee the name of a <hi>Christian?</hi> who liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
by Faith, rather then by Sence: For by how
many secret passages can <hi>God</hi> conveigh unto thee
the reward of thy Alms-deeds? though he writeth
no Superscription upon them, to certifie thee for
what it is sent; it is sufficient that thou hast it,
and that thou knowest that he sent it: As for the
reasons which moved him to give these benefits
unto thee, he wil acquaint thee with them more
particularly when he shal cal thee to make up thy
recknoning. Thou growest in thy stature from a
Child unto a Man, and thou seest not thy grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
though thou perceivest that thou art grown:
neither knowest thou the particular time, and
means when, or whereby thou comest to this
height: And thou knowest and acknowledgest,
that thou art nourished by thy meat, though thou
seest not the secret passages whereby it is carried
from the stomach to the several parts; nor canst
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:56896:66"/>
tell at what time, or by what food thou hast been
chiefly nourished. Why then hast thou not the
like faith? and much stronger in spiritual, then
thou hast in respect of natural things? seeing they
are much more secret and insensible; and when
thou hast <hi>God</hi>'s promise of reward, and seest it
performed by his blessings multiplied upon thee,
why dost thou doubt? or call them into question?
or ascribe them to thy self, or other helps? seeing
whatsoever the means are, they are of <hi>God</hi>'s send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Finally, if thou sayest, that thou seest no
possibility of increasing thy wealth, by giving a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
a great part of it unto the poor; I answer,
And what more reason hast thou by the collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Sence? that thy seed which thou sowest
should be multiplied, which thou castest away,
and lettest to rot in the earth, unless thou hast
learned it by experience: And is not <hi>God</hi>'s Word
a more infallible Teacher, and surer ground for
thy faith to rest on: especially when thou art not
without experience of the like increase, springing
from the sowing of the seeds of thy benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.</p>
            <p>To conclude this point, if thou doubtest of
these promises of <hi>God,</hi> made unto those who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the poor; because thou seest not how, or
when they are performed; why dost thou believe
the Remission of thy sins? Salvation by <hi>Christ?</hi>
and everlasting life? when as thou seest none of
these, nor hast any other ground but <hi>God</hi>'s pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
even as thou hast for the reward of thine
Alms-deeds: And therefore if thou doubtest of
the one, thou doubtest of the other: and were
not the profession of thy faith, concerning those
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:56896:67"/>
spiritual things good cheap; but that it should
cost thee as dear, as the giving of Alms: thou
wouldst doubtless discover and proclaim thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity
there, as well as here; and plainly shew,
that it was in meer formality and hypocrise. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
our mistrust, or at least the smal confidence
we have in what <hi>God</hi> speaks in his Word; especially
touching temporals, is the greatest wonder in the
world. And certainly if we cannot trust him for our
bodies; how do we, or how can we trust him with
our souls? which is the greater trust. But beloved,
what I speak I speak not to all; for we have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
our selves better things of you, and such
as accompany salvation, though we thus speak,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 9.</p>
            <p>And so I have <hi>finished,</hi> what at first I <hi>promised;</hi>
with an overplus in behalf of the Poor: But as
<hi>John</hi> could onely <hi>Baptize with water;</hi> so I can but
teach you with Words; and when <hi>God</hi> withholds
his contemned Grace, <hi>Paul</hi> himself cannot move
a soul.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> shall set it home to your hearts,
that you may so meditate on what hath been
spoken, and so practise what hath been prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed;
that <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Christ</hi> may be pacified, your sins
by free grace pardoned, and your souls eternally
saved: That while you are here, you may enjoy
<hi>the peace of God which passeth all understanding,</hi> Philip.

at the <hi>Haven</hi> of all happiness in <hi>Heaven; where is
fulness of joy, and pleasures for evermore,</hi> blessed and

and hope, I shall not onely take my <hi>work off
the Loom,</hi> or <hi>turn my Pinnace into the Harbor;</hi> by
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:56896:67"/>
making a conclusion of this subject (as well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering,
that those who are most insatiable in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things, will soonest be cloied with <hi>Mannah</hi>)
but likewise take leave of the <hi>Press;</hi> and that for
these Reasons:</p>
            <p>First, according to my scantling I have said
something (if not sufficient) in one or other of
my <hi>Six and thirty Pieces,</hi> to each <hi>soul seduced,</hi> or <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, (which would by the <hi>Reader</hi> be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered:)
As he <hi>gathers that reads; so he spends that
writes:</hi> and who so spends ere he gathers, shall soon
prove <hi>Bankrupt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, because the <hi>Bow</hi> that is alwaies <hi>bent;</hi>
will soon grow <hi>weak,</hi> and <hi>sluggish.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly I have bestowed so many years, and
taken so much pains <hi>in gleaning ears of corn</hi> with
<hi>Ruth, grinding at the Mill</hi> with <hi>Samson;</hi> in <hi>binding
Sheaves, carrying to the Mill, Barn &amp; Garner,</hi> in <hi>threshing,
Winnowing, Garbling, Kneading</hi> it into <hi>Paste,</hi> making
it into <hi>Loaves,</hi> and <hi>baking</hi> it into <hi>Bread,</hi> that so I
might have fine <hi>Manchet</hi> to set before you, (my
most welcome <hi>Guests</hi>) that (with <hi>Martha,</hi> in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining
her <hi>Saviour</hi>) I have wearied my self.
And the truth is, no mony could have hired me
to have taken the pains; had not an earnest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
and hope of the common good continually
spurred me to go on. Onely for this cause, and
the great pleasure I have taken in the work or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploiment:
I would not for a world have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred
from it. This may seem a <hi>Paradox;</hi> but it
is the immediate <hi>gift of God,</hi> (to those that he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploies
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:56896:68"/>
in such his service) thus to <hi>counterpoise</hi> their
<hi>labour</hi> with more then answerable <hi>delight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now unto the <hi>King Everlasting, Immortal, Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible;</hi>
unto <hi>God onely Wise: be Honour and glory, for
ever and ever, Amen,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 17.</p>
            <p>If you cannot remember all that I have said;
yet at least remember what the Holy Ghost says
in these ensuing places: <hi>Godliness is profitable for
all things; and hath the promises both of this life, and
of the life to come,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 8. <hi>The Lyons do lack, and
suffer hunger: but they that seek the Lord, shall want
nothing that is good: Psalm 34. 9, 10. Many sorrows shall
be to the wicked: but he that trusteth in the Lord, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
shall compass him about on every side. Psalm 32. 10.
He that giveth to the poor, shall not lack. Prov. 28. 27.
All things shall work together for the best, unto those that
love God. Rom. 8. 28.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Being much affected with this Example of <hi>Origen,</hi>
as deeming it exceeding rare, remarkable, &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
to make others beware: <hi>I</hi> have much desired, that
some <hi>Stationer</hi> would print it with some other small

one, and after that another, who were to print <hi>Spira,</hi> that
they would add this of <hi>Origen</hi> unto it, leaving my Copy
with them; but neither of them kept their promise, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
forsooth, that of <hi>Spira</hi> alone would sell for six pence,

which considered, none of them (I hope) can justly blame

            </p>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the days of <hi>Severus</hi> lived <hi>Origen,</hi> a man
famous for Learning, and in mental ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies
most rare and singular: he was
bold and servent under the reign of <hi>Severus, Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iminus,</hi>
and <hi>Decius,</hi> in assisting, comforting, exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and cherishing the Martyrs that were impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56896:69"/>
with such danger of his own life, that had
not God wonderfully protected him, he had bin
stoned to death many times of the heathen mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude;
for such great concourse of men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
went daily to his house to be catechised and
instructed in the Christian Faith by him, that
Souldiers were hired of purpose to defend the
place where he taught them.</p>
            <p>Again, such search sometimes was set for him,
that neither shifting of place nor Countrey could
hardly serve him. In which laborious travels and
affairs of the Church, in teaching, writing, confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
exhorting &amp; expounding, he continued about
fifty two years, unto the times of <hi>Decius &amp; Gallus;</hi>
divers and great persecutions he sustained; but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
under <hi>Decius,</hi> in his Body he sustained
Bonds and Torments, Rackings with Bars of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,
stinking and dark Dungeons, besides terrible
threats of Death and Burning; all which he man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
and constantly suffered for Christ: Yet at
length (like an Isickle) he that could endure the
rough Northern wind of Persecution wel enough,
melted with the heat of the Sun, (sweet Allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and fair Promises of Satan and his Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents;
his own flesh also, proving a treacherous
Solicitor:) For in the end, being brought by the
Idolatrous Infidels to an Altar of theirs, he shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
condescended to offer Incense the reupon,
in manner as followeth, by his own Confession.</p>
            <p>When (faith he) I sought to allure &amp; win these
Idolaters by cunning means to the knowledge of
the Son of God, after much sifting they promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
me (unhappy man!) that they would by
crafty conveyances avoid the subtilty of Satan,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56896:69"/>
and be baptized; But being ignorant, and unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in their divers cunning slenghts, they (toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the Devil) undermined my simplicity,
and Satan turning himself into an Angel of light,
reasoned with me that same night, saying, <hi>When
thou art up in the Morning, go on and perswade them,
and bring them unto God; and in case they demand ought
of thee, so they will hearken and condescend unto thee, do
what thou shalt think necessary, without staggering at all
at the matter, to the end many may be saved.</hi> And again,
the Devil going before to prepare the way, whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
their Wits to devise mischief against me, silly
Wretch, and sowed in their minds hypocrisie, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simulation,
and deceit. But I, O unhappy crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
skipping out of my Bed at the dawning of
the day, could not finish my wonted Devotions,
neither accomplish my usual prayer: But wishing
that all men might be saved, and come to the
knowledge of the Truth. I folded and wrapped
my self in the snares of the Devil, I got me unto
the wicked Assembly, I required of them to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the Covenant, made the night before; and
coming (as I thought) unto the Baptism; I (silly
soul) not knowing of any thing, answered but in
a word, and became reproachfully defamed. I
spake without malice, yet felt I their inveterate
and deadly spite; for instantly the Divel raised
an Assembly about me, who carried me to an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
of theirs, where a foul filthy <hi>Ethopian</hi> being
appointed, this option or choice was offered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me, namely; <hi>Whether I would sacrifice to the Idol;
or have my Body polluted with that foul and ugly Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian.</hi>
In which strait, I having ever kept my Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity
undefiled, and much abhorring that filthy
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56896:70"/>
villany to be done to my body, brake out into
many moans, lamentations and cryes against
both. Yet (O wretched man that I am) at length
yeilded rather to sacrifice. Whereupon the Judge
putting Incense into my hand, caused me to set
it to the fire upon the Altar; for the which impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
I was delivered both from that and Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
But upon my discharge, the Devil raised
such an out-cry in the City, in pronouncing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
me that just, and yet unjust sentence, <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen
hath sacrificed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereupon he was excommunicated out of
the Church and driven with shame and sorrow
out of <hi>Alexandria;</hi> and going to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and
being there among the Congregation, was reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
by the Priests to make some Exhortation in
the Church to the people; the which he refused
to do for a great while; but at length being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
through importunity, he rose up, and
turning the booke as though he would have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
some place of the Scripture, he hap'ned
upon, &amp; read onely the 16. <hi>verse</hi> of the 50. <hi>Psalm,</hi>
where he found it thus written; <hi>But God said unto
the sinner, What hast thou to do to declare my Statutes,
or that thou shouldst take my Covenant into thy mouth;
seeing thou hatest instruction, and castest my Word behind
thee?</hi> Which being read, he shut the Book, and
sate down weeping and wailing, the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
weeping and lamenting with him; he
said unto the Church, Wo is me; my Mother
which brought me forth as an high and lofty Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret,
yet suddenly I am turned down to the
ground; as a fruitful Tree, yet quickly withered;
as a burning Light, yet forthwith darkned; as a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56896:70"/>
running Fountain, yet by and by dried up. Wo is
me that ever I was decked with all gifts and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and now seem pitifully to be deprived of all.
The Lord hath made and ingrafted me a fruitful
Vine, but instead of pleasant Clusters of Grapes,
I brought forth pricking Thorns: Let the Well-springs
of tears be stirred up, and let my Cheeks
be watered; let them flow upon the earth, and
moisten it; for that I am soaked in sin, and bound
in mine iniquity; every creature sorroweth, and
may well pity my case, for that I was wont here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
to pour out my prayers unto God for them
all; but now there is no salve for me: Where is he
that went down from <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to <hi>Jericho,</hi> who
also salved and cured him that was wounded of
the Thieves? Whenas I went about to enlighten
others, I darkned my self; when I endeavoured to
bring others from death to life, I brought my self
from life to death.</p>
            <p>Oh blinded heart! how didst thou not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber?
O foolish mind! how didst thou not bethink
thy self? O witless brain! how didst thou not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand?
O thou Sence of Understanding! Where
didst thou sleep? But it was the Devil which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
thee to slumber and sleep, and in the end
to slay thy unhappy &amp; wretched soul: He bound
my power and might, and wonded me. I bewail
sometime the fall of <hi>Sampson,</hi> but now have I faln
far worse my self. I bewailed heretofore the fall
of <hi>Solomon,</hi> yet now am I faln far worse my self.
<hi>I</hi> have bewailed heretofore the estate of all sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
yet now am <hi>I</hi> plunged worse then them all,
<hi>Sampson</hi> had the hair of his head clipt off, but the
Crown of Glory is faln off my head. <hi>Sampson</hi> lost
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56896:71"/>
the curnal eyes of his body, but my spiritual eyes
are digged out: Even as he was severed from the
<hi>Israelites,</hi> and held captive among Idolaters, so <hi>I</hi>
have separated my self from the Church of God,
and am joined with evil spirits. Alas! my Church
liveth, yet am <hi>I</hi> a Widower, Alas! my Sons be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live,
yet am I barren, Alas O Spirit which camest
heretofore down upon me, why hast thou forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
me? O thou Devil, what hast thou done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me? O Satan, how hast thou wounded me? It
was the wiliness of a Woman that brought <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
to his confusion; but it was my own <hi>Tongue</hi> that
brought me to this sinful Fall. Alas! every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
rejoiceth, and I alone forsaken and sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
Bewaile him that is bereaved of the Holy
Ghost; bewail me that am thrust out of the Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding-Chamber
of Christ; bewail me that am tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
with the prick of Conscience; for now it
behoveth me to shed infinite tears for my great
sin. Who knoweth whether the Lord wil have
mercy upon me? Whether he will pity my fall?
Whether, he will be moved with my desolation?
Whether he will have respect unto my humility,
and incline his tender compassion towards me?
Now let the Elders mourn, for that the staffe
whereto they leaned is broken. Now let they young
men mourn, for that their School-Master is faln.
Now let the Virgins mourn, for that the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
of Virginity is defiled. Now let the Priests
mourn, for that their Patron and Defender is
shamefully falne from the Faith. Assist me holy
Spirit, and give me Grace to repent. Let the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of tears be opened, and gush out into streams,
to see if that peradventure I may have the grace

worthily and throughly to repent: Why hast thou
shut my mouth by the holy Prophet <hi>David?</hi> Am
I the first that have sinned? Or am I the first that
fell? Why hast thou forsaken me, and banished
me from among the Saints, and astonied me to
preach thy Laws? Saint <hi>Peter</hi> the Pillar of truth,
after his fall, wiped away that bitter passion of
forswearing his Master, with monrnful tears, and
was purged from the venom of the Serpent in a
short time, Restore me again to my former health
of salvation. O all ye which behold my wounds,
tremble for fear, least God forsake you, and you
fall into the like crime. O wo is me that I am fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
from among the company of the blessed
Assemblies: I have my death's wound: I see the
Clouds in the Skye shadowing the Light from me,
and the Sun hiding from me his bright beams. O
Satan! What mischief hast thou wrought unto
me? How hast thou pierced my breast with thy
poysoned Dart? Thinkest thou that my ruine
will avail thee any thing at all? Thinkest thou
to procure unto thy self ease and rest, whiles that
I am grievously tormented? But how can I speak,
whenas my Tongue is tyed? My lips dare not
once move; my throat is dammed up; all my sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and instruments are polluted with iniquity.
But <hi>I</hi> will proceed on; and first, I will fall to the
ground on my bare knees, and make mine hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
supplication unto all the faithfull, and blessed
of God, both great and small, that they wil help
me, silly wretch, which by reason of the superstui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of my sinne, dare not crave ought at the hands
of God: O ye Saints and blessed of God, with
waterish eyes, and wet cheeks soaked in dolour

and pain. I beseech you to fall down before the
Mercy-seat of God for me miserable sinner, wo is
me, that am compassed thus on every side, &amp; shut
up in my sin: The Lord hath made me an Angel, I
have made my self a Devil: I was as as a skilful law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer,
yet am I overthrown by my unrighteous deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
I was an heir of the Kingdom of God, but
now am an inheritor of the Kingdom of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel:

Eyes, that I may bewail my self in this my sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful
plight? O all ye my friends, tender my
case, pity my person, in that I am dangerously
wounded, in that I am a scorn to all men; for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
trodden under foot the the Seal and Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance
of my Profession, and joined in League
with the Devil. In that I am rejected and cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from the face of God; it is for my lewd life
that I am thus polluted. I see the Spider over my
seat building his Cobweb: There is no sorrow
like to my sorrow; there is no affliction that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
my affliction; there is no bitterness that
passeth my bitterness; there is no lamentation
more lamentable then mine? Neither is there
any sin greater then my sin, for there is no salve
for me. Where is that good Shepherd of Souls?
I have broken my Vow I made in Baptism: Alas
that ever I was Doctor, and now occupy not the
room of a Disciple! Thou knowest, O Lord, that
I fell against my Will: Who is able to signifie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me, when again I shall be coupled, and made
Companion of the Saints of God? O! I am not
worthy to hear the Message of them that bring
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56896:72"/>
such tidings; for the threats of the Prophets and
Evangelists onely belong unto me. O the bosom
of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the which I am deprived of! I am
becom partaker with the Rich Man in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,
and scorching flames in the horrible
pit? I am tormented with the prick of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
I do fear the dreadful day of Judgment,
for that I am damn'd for ever, I do fear the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
for that it is eternal. I will prostrate
my self before the Threshold and Porches of the
Church, that I may intreat all people both small
and great, and will say unto them, Trample and
tread me under foot, which am the foolish Salt,
the unsavory Salt; tread me which have no taste
nor rellish of God: Wo is me that I fell most
dangerously, and cannot rise again. Assist me, O
Holy Syirit, and give me grace to repent, and
wipe out of the Book of the Conscience, the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation
printed against me: But thou, O Lord,
think upon me, though I am of polluted lips, and
have uttered lewd things with my Tongue; and
accept thou Repentance, Affliction, and bitter
tears, the dolour of my heart, and the heaviness
of my soul; and have mercy upon me, and raise
me up from out of the Mire of Corruption and
Filth; for the puddle hath even choaked me up.
Wo is me, that sometime was a Pearle glistering
in the golden garland of Glory, but now thrown
into the dust, and trodden in the mire of
contempt? Wo is me, that the Salt of God
now lieth on the Dunghil! O how many great
streams of Lamentation and tears will wash a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
and purge mine humble heart? <hi>I</hi> will turn
my talk to God: Why hast thou lift me up, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56896:73"/>
cast me down? <hi>I</hi> had not committed this impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
unless thou hadst withdrawn thy hand from
me. <hi>David</hi> sinned too bad in thy sight, yet after
his Repentance thou receivedst him to mercy:
Grant that <hi>I</hi> may not become and habitation for
Devils, but that <hi>I</hi> may trample under foot the
Devil, which hath trod upon me. <hi>I</hi> have fallen
and am bruised, there is no health in me. <hi>Why
