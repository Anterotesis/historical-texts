            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The Resurrection of Christ from the Dead,

and is so much the more necessary to be

believed and confirmed, as it gives Testimony to
the rest, and upon which as to their Proof and
Evidence they do mainly depend. So the Apostle
grants. 1 Cor. 15. 14. <hi>If Christ be not risen, then
is our preaching vain; and your faith is also vain.</hi>
And therefore as our Saviour himself beforehand
refer'd his Disciples frequently to his Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;<note place="margin">Matth. 12. 38. 16. 4, 21. 20. 18.</note>
So in the first place the Apostles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
upon it as being what,<note place="margin">Joh. 2. 19</note> is proved, would
render the whole unquestionable.<note place="margin">Acts 2. 23, 24, 32. 3. 15, 26. 4. 10. 5. 30.</note> This Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
then required sufficient proof; and for this
reason <hi>God shewed him openly,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
he gave him to be manifest, or made
it manifest that he was the Person
whom they had known,<note place="margin">So the Phrase is used, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 20. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>I was made manifest.</hi>
               </note> and had
known before to be Crucified and

him to us, who did eat and drink with him after he
rose from the dead</hi>: Or, as it is, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 3.
<hi>To whom he shewed himself alive after his Passion,
by many infallible proofs, being seen of them forty
days.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was absolutely necessary then to the
proof of his Resurrection, That he should be
thus evidently manifested to be the very Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that had been Crucified and Slain, and was
now verily alive; and that it should be to such

               </gap> yet it

                  </gap> 
               </hi> By
which Phrase St. <hi>Peter</hi> here seems to point more
particularly to the Apostles, when he adds,
<hi>Even to us that did eat and drink with him after he
rose from the dead.</hi> And therefore this seems to
have been a peculiar Qualification for an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
that such a one should have seen and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed
with our Saviour both before his Death
and after his Resurrection from it. So when
they were about chusing one into the place of
<hi>Judas, Peter</hi> said,<note place="margin">Acts 1. 21, 22.</note> 
               <hi>Wherefore of these men who have
companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus
went in and out among us, beginning at the Baptism
of John unto the same day that he was taken up from
us, must one be ordained to be a witness with us of
his Resurrection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus it was appointed by Our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:<note place="margin">Luk. 24, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48.</note>
               <hi>These are the words which I spake unto you,
while I was yet with you — And thus it behoved
Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead — And
ye are witnesses of these things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And accordingly the Apostles insist upon this
their designation and choice, <hi>Acts.</hi> 2. 32. <hi>This

            </p>
            <p>(3.) They are such chosen Witnesses as had
sufficient Evidence to prove this their Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and the Authority they had to testify and
preach to the people that Christ was thus risen,
and was <hi>ordained of God to be the Judge of quick
and dead.</hi> And this Evidence was the descent of
the Holy Ghost upon them: Therefore these
two are joined together, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 32. <hi>We are all
witnesses of these things, and so is also the Holy
Ghost whom God hath given to them that obey him.</hi>
But this brings on the Second General, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Why was not Christ shewn after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
<hi>to all the people</hi> as well as unto <hi>chosen
Witnesses</hi>?</p>
            <p>Our B. Saviour in the time of his Three
Years Ministry <hi>went about doing good,</hi> v. 38.
and <hi>came</hi> (as he saith of himself) <hi>eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. 11. 19.</note>
and freely conversed, as there was occasion;
but though he abode 40 days upon the Earth,
after his Resurrection, he seemed then rather to
retire from Conversation, than to use it as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
and his Visits were rather occasional than
continued.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:62720:6"/>
Now it might be thought to have render'd
his Resurrection more unquestionable, and
would have been more to the satisfaction of
Mankind, if he had as commonly and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
shewn himself alive after his Resurrection,
as before his Death, to all the people. For in
such a case, what a Man sees himself, is better
than a Thousand Witnesses; and the more
there are that see it, the stronger is the Evidence
to those that have not seen.</p>
            <p>Our Apostle foresaw this Objection; and
that the <hi>Jews</hi> at that time might cavil at what the
Witnesses Taught concerning our Saviour's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,
and would probably say; If he were ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen,
Why did he not appear to us as well as to
you? We heard him Teach for Years together
before his Death: We saw him Crucified, and
knew that he died: And if he is risen from the
Dead, the best Proof of it to us, is to have
him shew himself to us to be alive, as ye say he
did to you. Therefore the Apostle prevents
this, when he saith, <hi>God shewed him openly, not to
all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God,
even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he
rose from the dead.</hi> Where the Apostle grants,
That Christ was not shewn to all the People af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Resurrection; but withal he insinuates
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62720:7"/>
this to be no prejudice to the proof of it; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch
as he was manifested to Witnesses chosen
before of God, and that did Eat and Drink with
him afterwards.</p>
            <p>In which there are several things included;
As,</p>
            <p>1. That it was not necessary that Christ
should be openly shewn to all the people, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
and oblige them to the belief of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection.</p>
            <p>2. That if there were sufficient Testimony of
it by persons in all respects credible, and as far as
Testimony could go, That was a sufficient Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
for credibility, and a sufficient Argument to
oblige those to believe, that did not see. Indeed
there is no other way than Testimony to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
those to the belief of it, that had not the
opportunity of Seeing, Hearing, Eating and
Drinking, and Conversing with our Saviour, in
matters depending upon Testimony; and where
there cannot be any other Evidence (as it is in
Matters of Fact remote in time or place) all
that is to be relied on is the reasonableness and
possibility of the thing, and the credibility of
the Testificators. As to the possibility, it may
with great reason be asked, as it is <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 8.
<hi>Why should it be thought a thing incredible, that God
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62720:7"/>
should raise the dead?</hi> Or that a Dead Person
should revive. And as to the credibility of the
Persons, What can be a greater Evidence, than
that they saw and felt that he had Flesh and
Bones,<note place="margin">Luk. 24. 39.</note> beheld his Wounds,<note place="margin">John 20. 25.</note> Eat and Drank,
and for 40 days together on and off, conversed
with him?<note place="margin">Act. 1. 3. .</note> So that the proofs they had, were <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,</hi>
               <note>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note>
and of the greatest certainty. They had
such an Evidence as was to themselves unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable,
and which shewed him to be the self-same
person that they conversed with before his
Death, and that they saw Dead. Thus St. <hi>John</hi>
represents it in a sensible way,<note place="margin">1 John 1. 1, 2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>That which was
seen, from the beginning, which we have heard,
which we have seen with our eyes, which we have
looked upon, and our hands have handled of the word
of Life. (For the Life was manifested, and we have
seen it, and bear witness,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>That which we have
seen and heard, declare we unto you</hi>: And the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
they gave to others was as convincing;
they professed it boldly in the midst of the
most apparent dangers; and notwithstanding
the threats of a provoked and implacable Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary,
were ready to, and did, seal it with their
Blood.<note place="margin">Act. 4. 8.</note> And that nothing might be wanting
to give the greatest corroboration and strength
to their Evidence, they did work such Miracles
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62720:8"/>
as were manifestly the effect of a Divine Power,
and which they professed to work only in the
name of Christ, whom they affirmed to be ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
from the Dead. <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 16. 4. 10.</p>
            <p>So that if ever there was sufficient Evidence
for a Matter of Fact, this is the Evidence. And
where this was, there needed no more.</p>
            <p>But however, because it may still be urged,
That there was a shorter way to this; and there
needed no Witnesses, nor Miracles, if he had
appeared to the People; and therefore why was
not this allowed to them, as well as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles?</p>
            <p>I Answer,</p>
            <p>1. It was allowed to a sufficient Number,
besides the Apostolical Witnesses; for besides
his first Apparition, and the casual Visits he
gave to the Apostles, there was a solemn Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
in a Mountain of <hi>Galilee,</hi> where he appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to meet them:<note place="margin">Mat. 28. 7, 16.</note> And there, or elsewhere, was
he seen by above Five hundred Bretbren <hi>at
once.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 6.</note> Nay, we are told, That he was seen of
them Forty days,<note place="margin">Act. 1. 3.</note> and talked with them <hi>of the
things pertaining to the kingdom of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The Christians are called always in the
Phrase of this Book of the <hi>Acts,</hi> the <hi>Brethren, Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi>
or <hi>Disciples</hi>: But by the <hi>People</hi> is meant the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62720:8"/>
Promiscuous Multitude of the <hi>Jews</hi>: And then we
are to consider what the mass of that People
was; they were the obstinate incredulous People,
that imputed his Works to <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> that cried
out,<note place="margin">Mark 15. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Crucify him,</hi> and wished <hi>his Blood</hi> to be
<hi>upon them and their Children.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. 27. 25.</note> They were such
as were no longer to be a People, and whose
House and Temple,<note place="margin">Matt. 23. 38.</note> Church and Nation were
to be laid <hi>desolate</hi>: And so had no Pretence to
such a Saviour.</p>
            <p>But as for such among them as were sincere,
and ingenuous, and could be prevailed with,
here was Evidence sufficient; and if upon such
Evidence they could not be prevailed with to
believe, nothing would prevail upon them;
nor was any other means due to them.</p>
            <p>Thus we find it was with the <hi>Jews</hi> in another
Case; some of whom, that saw <hi>Lazarus</hi> after
his Resurrection, <hi>went their ways to the Pharisees,
and told them what things Jesus had done,</hi> John
11. 46.</p>
            <p>And the Chief Priests, when the Watch gave
them an account of what happened upon the
Resurrection of our Saviour; and told them,
how the Angel appeared, and came and roll'd
back the Stone; and that for fear of him they
did shake, and became as dead Men, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62720:9"/>
obstinate; and by large Money
prevailed upon the Soldiers to say, <hi>His dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
came by night and stole him away whilst we
slept.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 28. 2, 11, 13.</note> When there is such a Perverseness of Mind,
they will cavil eternally, and will question their
own Senses rather than own that which they
do not like, and is to be and may be proved
by that means to them. Thus our Saviour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves
the point, Luke 16. 31. <hi>If they hear not
Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
though one rise from the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was to little purpose to labour to convince
such; it was in our Saviour's Phrase, to <hi>cast Pearl
before Swine,</hi> to give them an occasion of renewing
their invectives and reproaches. Such as these
were not worthy of such favours. So <hi>Lactantius</hi>
saith,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Noluit se Judaeis ostendere, nè adduceret eos in paeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam, atque impios resanaret.</hi> De Ver. Sap. L. 4.</note> 
               <hi>He would not shew himself to the Jews, lest
he should bring them to repentance, and heal the wicked.</hi> For,</p>
            <p>3. The nature of the thing
would not admit it, that he
should thus be shewn to all the people; For
Faith is all along made a necessary qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for Salvation. <hi>If thou shalt confess with thy
mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine
heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou
shalt be saved,</hi> Rom. 10. 9.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:62720:9"/>
But where had there been any room or occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
for the Exercise of this so celebrated a
Grace, if our Saviour had openly been shewn,
and appeared to all the People after his Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection?
This had been such Evidence as none
could have gainsaid: And then there would
have been no Mark nor Character by which the
Believer and Sincere could have been distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the Unbeliever and Caviller; nor would
Faith have been a Virtue worthy of Praise or
Reward, more than the Exercise of our Senses
is upon their proper and natural Objects.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour said to <hi>Thomas,</hi> John 20. 25.
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> (Who, when he beheld in his Hands the
print of the Nails, and thrust his Hand into his
Side, acknowledged him and said, <hi>My Lord
and my God</hi>) <hi>Thomas, because thou hast seen me,
thou hast believed; blessed are they that have not
seen, and yet have believed.</hi> To believe that
Christ was risen when he saw him, and put
his Finger into the print of the Nails, and thrust
his Hand into his wounded Side, was an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
no more to be questioned, than whether
he himself was alive and sensible.</p>
            <p>And therefore if there was to be such a thing
as Faith, or a believing where they have not
seen: If Faith is a Virtue commendable and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62720:10"/>
worthy of such a Reward as Eternal Life; 'tis
fit there should be a way of trial, by which
the candid and ingenuous, the honest and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,
may be distinguished from the perverse and
obstinate.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 19.</note> And as the Apostle saith, <hi>there must
be Heresies</hi> and Sects, <hi>that they which are approved</hi>
and sincere <hi>may be made manifest</hi>: So 'tis
fit that there should not be the utmost Evidence
given that can be, or that Cavillers may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
for the trial of sincerity, and whether
persons will use that attention and diligence in
inquiring, that candour and sincerity in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining,
as Faith is not to be obtained, nor
can truly be called Faith without. And this
is a reason why Christ after his Resurrection
was openly shew'd to chosen Witnesses, and
not to all the People. Thus
<hi>Tertullian</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Apol. <hi>Non in vulgus eduxit se, nè impij errore liberarentur: Et ut fides non mediocri praemio destinata, difficultate constaret.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>He did not
offer himself to the view of the
People, lest the Wicked should
be delivered from their error</hi>: He adds, <hi>and that Faith
which has assigned to it no small reward, might meet
with difficulty.</hi> Then it is Faith, and Faith is a
Virtue, as it was in those St. <hi>Peter</hi> speaks of,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 8.</note>
               <hi>Whom having not seen, ye love: And in whom,
though now ye see him not, yet believing ye rejoice
with joy unspeakable and full of glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:62720:10"/>
But yet however, Though Faith in Christ,
and a Belief of his Resurrection, be thus neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to all, to those that saw him not, as well
as to those that saw him; yet there must be an
Evidence sufficient to induce them to believe
that did not see, and to render them inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable
that believe not; which should be the
Subject of the next General, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That it is a sufficient Proof of Christ's
Resurrection, and a sufficient reason for our
belief of it, That he was thus openly shewn
to such Witnesses, though not to all the People.
There was an absolute necessity for the Proof
of Christ's Resurrection that he should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
plainly and visibly to some; and to whom
sooner than to those that had been before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant
with him, and were chosen by God
Himself to be the Witnesses of it? But when
this was done, and they were sufficiently em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powred
to testify of it, there was no necessity
that the same Evidence should be given to
others that was given to them, for the reasons
before laid down: Where I have already pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
my self; so that I need not further to
inlarge upon this Argument.</p>
            <p>And so I shall proceed to the 4th General,
which is,</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:62720:11"/>
4. To consider the Testimony which is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by Christ's Resurrection to the Doctrine
Taught by the chosen Witnesses; and that is
Christ's being ordained by God to be the Judge
of Quick and Dead.</p>
            <p>In which there are these Four Things to be
considered:<list>
                  <item>1. That there is a Time of Reckoning, and
a Judgment to Come, when all men shall
give an account of themselves to God, and be
determined to Happiness or Misery, according
to what they have done in this Life.</item>
                  <item>2. That Christ is ordained to be at that
Time, the Judge of Quick and Dead.</item>
                  <item>3. That this is as certain so to be, as that
God raised up Christ from the Dead.</item>
                  <item>4. That this is a Doctrine of such impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and universal concernment to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
that it is to be preached to all the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That there is a Judgment to come.</p>
            <p>This World is a state of Trial, where every
person has a Work to Do, an Office to Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge,
a Talent to Improve, and a Time
for it. But the time of reckoning, when a
Person is to give an account of his Steward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
is reserved to another Life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:62720:11"/>
And indeed the nature of this state will not
admit that it should be otherwise, and that
persons here should receive their finall Doom.
For here God rules in an ordinary way by the
Ministry of Men, and under these circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
it is not possible <hi>to lay Judgment to the Line,
and Righteousness to the Plummet,</hi> and to bring
all things to a right and unerring determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>For men can judge only <hi>according to outward
appearance,</hi> and cannot understand what are the
secret and original Springs of Action, which
often are lodged very deep, and yet which
must be known, if we would pass an impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Judgment.</p>
            <p>Again; There are Actions of the Heart,
which betray not themselves by any External
Signs and Indications, and so are only know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to God the searcher of the Heart.</p>
            <p>Again, There are even some External Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that a person is himself only privy to;
as secret Injustice on one side, and private
Charity on the other, when the <hi>left hand knows
not what the right hand doth.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6. 3.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Again; There are many Acts Good or Evil,
which the Laws of men have no regard to,
as Gratitude and Ingratitude, that are highly
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62720:12"/>
commendable or injurious; and yet no Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Authority doth oblige to the Virtue, nor
punish the want of it.</p>
            <p>Again, Men are very partial, apt to be
byassed by Enmity, Envy, Interest, Fear or
Flattery, or Prejudice on one side to the worse,
or by prepossession from Affection and Interest
to the other.</p>
            <p>And therefore there needs a Higher Tribunal,
where Universal Knowledge, Unlimited Power,
Impartial Administration bear sway: Where all
things shall be finally decided, all cases fully
resolved and determined, according to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of them.</p>
            <p>
               <note>Eccl. 3. 16, 17. Rom. 2. 6. 15. Eccl. 12. 14. 1 Cor. 4. 5.</note>This then the present state of things in the
World doth shew: This the Consciences of men
do presage: This the Scripture every where incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates:
This will be a Judgment exact and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial,
final, and irreversible. A Consideration of
mighty force: So <hi>Solomon</hi> thought it, when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
his Advice with it, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12. 13. <hi>Let us hear
the conclusion of the whole matter, Fear God and keep
his Commandments — for God shall bring every work
into Judgment, with every secret thing, whether it
be good, or whether it be evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So thought St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 9, 10. <hi>We labour,
that whether present or absent, we may be accepted
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62720:12"/>
of him. For we must all appear before the Judgment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seat
of Christ</hi> — v. 11. <hi>Knowing therefore the Terror
of the Lord, we persuade men.</hi> And surely this
will persuade men, or nothing will: This will
persuade, if they are to be persuaded. The
Rich Man thought so, when he concluded, That
if <hi>Lazarus</hi> rose from the Dead, and went to
his Five Brethren, and testified unto them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
a Place of Torment, they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.
And surely if this Doctrine was as much
believed, and as well considered as it is of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
it would quicken the Slothful, awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the Drowsy and Negligent, reform the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,
and conquer the Obstinate. If they did
but after this manner reflect upon themselves:<note place="margin">Gal. 6. 7.</note>
Is the Time coming, when <hi>whatsoever a
man soweth, that shall he also reap?</hi> when all that
I have done, said or thought, shall be brought
into Examination? Are all these things wrote
down in a Book of Remembrance? What a
condition then am I in, to appear before such a
Judge, and such a Tribunal? If I know so
much by my self, who have kept no such Book,
taken no such punctual account of my self,
and yet know so much as to condemn
my self, and stand condemned by my
own Heart; what shall I say or think, when
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62720:13"/>
God is <hi>greater than my heart, and knoweth all
things</hi>?<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 20.</note>
            </p>
            <p>May we not justly cry out with the Psalmist,
<hi>Enter not into judgment with thy Servant, O
Lord! for in thy sight shall no flesh living be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ps. 143. 2</note>
            </p>
            <p>And again,<note place="margin">Ps. 130. 3</note> 
               <hi>If thou, Lord, shouldest mark iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: O Lord, who shall stand? but there is forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
with him</hi>; and that is testified by Jesus
Christ, and confirmed by God's raising him
from the Dead, who was a Propitiation for our
Sins. Which brings me to the second.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That Christ is ordained to be, at that
Time, the Judge of Quick and Dead.</p>
            <p>So we read <hi>John</hi> 5. 22. That <hi>the Father hath
committed all judgment to the Son</hi>; and v. 28,
29. <hi>The time is coming, when all that are in the
grave shall hear his voice, and come forth</hi>; <hi>and
shall stand before the judgment-seat of Christ</hi>:<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 10.</note> 
               <hi>That
God shall judge the secrets of men by him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 16.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Matter indeed of just Terror to the Wicked,
That he is then to be the Judge, who thought
nothing too dear to purchase their Redemption,
but freely parted with his own Life for it. How
must those stand Speechless, and be Inexcusable,
<hi>When the Lord shall be revealed from Heaven with
his mighty Angels, in flaming fire, taking venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62720:13"/>
on them that know not God, and that obey not
the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Thess. 1. 7, 8.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But on the other side, What Comfort will
this administer to all True Believers, That He
is to be the Judge, who <hi>took part of the same</hi>
with them, and laid down his Life for them?<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 14.</note>
To see him whom they have believed in as their
Saviour, loved and obeyed as their Lord! To
see him whom they have longed to see! What
Joy will it then be to such! What Comfort will
spring up in their Minds, <hi>When the Lord Jesus
shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be
admired of all them that believe in that day</hi>!<note place="margin">2 Thess. 1. 10.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. There is the certainty of this; As certainly
is there a Judgment to come, and as certainly
shall Christ then be the Judge, as he himself rose
from the Dead.</p>
            <p>Thus the Apostle improves it; <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 31.
God <hi>hath appointed a Day, in which he will judge
the world in righteousness, by that man whom he hath
ordained, and of which he hath given assurance to
all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.</hi>
That indeed is an undeniable Testimony for
whatever it is to prove. So it was thought
by that miserable Person in Hell, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 30.
who said of his Five Brethren, <hi>If one went from
the dead, they will repent.</hi> That is, There is no
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62720:14"/>
Evasion, it is Evidence not to be gainsaid.
But here is one risen from the Dead, that has
<hi>brought Life and Immortality to Light.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 10.</note> And then
how inexcusable must they be that disregard such
a Testimony, or the matter it bears Testimony
to? <hi>Let him come down from the cross,</hi> say the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulous
Jews, <hi>and we will believe.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 27. 42.</note> But here
is one come from the Dead, and what can
be said then, if they believe not?</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Doctrine of a Future Judgment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Point of great importance to all, is to be
preached unto the People. This is the Use
St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes of it, <hi>knowing the terror of the
Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 10.</note> [That <hi>we must all appear before the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-seat
of Christ] we persuade men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And surely there is no matter of greater Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
no Argument of greater Force and Persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and so none more to be used, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated,
and insisted upon by the Teacher;
none more fit to be considered by the People,
both as to the Consequence of it, and the Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
of Mankind, in the Consideration of
it. What an Influence would this Doctrine of
a Judgment to come have upon us, if firmly
believed, duly pondered, and frequently thought
upon? If it was but taken into serious Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
in the beginning of the Day, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62720:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
upon in the close of it, what Evil would
it prevent? And what Good would it put us
upon and promote? If the Thoughts of it did
but intervene in the Spaces of our Business,
how just and exact would it make us in our
Dealings? How observant of our Words and
Behaviour? How would it oblige us to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
our Time, and to lay out our Talents to
the best Advantage.</p>
            <p>And yet, though this be one of the most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
Subjects we can think upon, and the most
necessary to have frequently in our Thoughts;
though this be an Article we all profess to
believe, how little is it in our Minds?
How little Influence has it upon us; when we
think, and speak, and act for the most part as
if all were shut up with the Day, and no more
to be revealed than the Day it self?</p>
            <p>Considering which (the Importance of the
Subject, and the Incogitancy of Mankind) it is
therefore necessary that it should be often preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto the People: That it should be pressed
upon them with the utmost Force; and if possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
be of as much Efficacy as it is of Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Consequence. It is God that requires it
of the Teacher; for, saith the Apostle here, <hi>He
commanded us to preach unto the people; and to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62720:15"/>
testifie, That it is he who was ordained of God to be
the judge of quick and dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was the Consideration of this, without
Doubt, amongst other things, that has in all Ages
stirred up Pious and Well-disposed Persons to do
Good to others; and to make the best Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Stock given to them by God the
Prime Donor and Benefactor: Of which we
have memorable Examples; and of the
Fruits of which Charity and Benevolence,

            <p>In this Report I have now laid before you
such Noble Instances of Christian Charity, as
scarcely any City of the whole World can
parallel; and that, whether we consider the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62720:16"/>
several useful Ends for which those Charities
were bestowed, and these Places endowed;
or the Faithfulness of the Governours con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in the Administration. It is above an
Hundred Years ago (as has been, I perceive,
before observed to this Congregation) when
the Members of our Church did publickly,
in the Face of the World, challenge the
great Pretenders to such Charities (I mean
those of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) to compare
with them. <hi>I forbid the best of them,</hi> saith
one of the great Men of that Age, upon
this very Occasion, <hi>to shew me in</hi> Rhemes
<hi>or</hi> Rome <hi>such a Shew as we have seen these
Two Days<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>; [He Preached on the <hi>Wednesday</hi>
in <hi>Easter</hi>-Week.] He goes on, <hi>I will be
able to prove, That Learning, in the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of Schools; the Poor, in Foundation of
Alms-Houses, have received greater Help, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
these Forty Years, than it hath in any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Realm, not only within the self-same For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Years, but also than it hath in any Forty
Years upwards, during all the Time of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews,</hi> (after Bishop) Spittal-Sermon, 1588. p. 17. and Dr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let</hi>'s <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopsis Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pismi.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>And if so, What a wonderful Increase has
been since made, and that within the last Forty
Years, notwitstanding the vast Devastations of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62720:16"/>
a Civil War, and of a devouring Fire; any one
that will take the Pains to compare the State of
the City alone, as it was then, and as it is
now, may see.</p>
            <p>And I am sure there is not a greater Increase
in the Revenue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than there is an Improvement
of the Administration. Let us but Review the
Particulars.</p>
            <p>1. As to the Orphans; What a Number is
there? What Care is there taken in their Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation?
First in their Nurseries, which of late
they have erected; and by a kind of Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giate
Institution, kept those Younglings from
being reached by those Temptations, which in
promiseuous Company of other Children they
were before liable to be perverted by.</p>
            <p>And when transplanted hither, into a riper
Soyl, how are they immediately disposed of to
the best Advantage, according to their Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
upon due Tryal and Observation?</p>
            <p>There is nothing wanting to furnish them
with Learning, if their Inclination tend that
way; or if they are otherwise disposed by their
Genius, there are other Masters for Writing and
Accounts, Mathematicks, Navigation, Trade
by Land or Sea. So that there is an Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that will make them useful Members of a
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62720:17"/>
Commonwealth; and an Education which any
one would be ambitious of; and others that are
able, elsewhere, pay liberally for.</p>
            <p>But there is one thing not to be forgotten,
and that is, The Pains that is taken to train
them up in Virtue and Piety: So that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the great Number of Youth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
there is not more Care taken of the
Cleanliness of the Place and Apparel, the Whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somness
of the Diet, than of their Morals and
Virtue, and their Instruction in the Principles
of Religion.</p>
            <p>The next thing that comes in our View, is
the Care of the Sick and the Maimed;
who can take little or no Care of themselves,
and are here liberally provided for. And so are
they that cannot so much as crave help, or know
that they stand in need of it; I mean the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natick;
and even the perverse and obstinate, are
not neglected. Let us go through all the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series
of Mankind, and all states of men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them, and there is scarcely any but
what have found careful and liberal Benefactors.</p>
            <p>So that I know nothing wanting to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
it, but some further care of the Prisons, and
a repressing of those numbers of vagrant Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars,
that are the burthen of the Kingdom,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62720:17"/>
and the reproach of it. All the reflection I shall
make of this, shall be from the fore-cited Author.
<hi>Methinks,</hi> saith he,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 21.</note> 
               <hi>It is strange that the exiled Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of strangers which are harboured here with us,
shall be able in this kind to do such good, as
not one of their poor is to be seen to ask about
the streets, and this City the harbourer and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainer
of them, should not be able to do the same
good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But my Business is not so much to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
the praises of such as have been Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
and Bountiful in this way, though they
deserve to be had <hi>in Everlasting remembrance</hi>
for it; as it is to provoke others to an imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the like Pious and Charitable Minds;
which God be thanked other Ages, and even
this, is not wanting in. But however, there
is room enough for others to follow; and
I am sorry for making such an Observation
upon the whole, as will not only make it
very commendable, but a necessary Work;
and to speak Christianly, a Duty to such
whom God hath prospered in such a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
manner, as they may be capable of
it.</p>
            <p>And this is so much the more capable of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement,
that in all, the Expence is much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62720:18"/>
the standing Revenue, and in some near,
if not above, a Moiety beyond it.</p>
            <p>And what can be the issue of this, but aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
their Debt, or that others by their
Benefactions should prevent it?</p>
            <p>What remains therefore, but that those that
are not under those necessities, should consider
the case of those that are?</p>
            <p>Let those who have had Parents to provide for
them; or who have been by the Wonderful
Providence of God, notwithstanding their want
of it, rais'd in the World to plentiful
Estates, shew their thankfulness to God by a
care of those that are Orphans and <hi>Comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 14. 18.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Let such as have their Health and Limbs,
and so can enjoy the Estate God has blessed
them with, consider those that want Health and
Riches, nay the Necessities of Life to support
them under those Infirmities.</p>
            <p>Let those that have the use of their Senses,
and that have not had occasion to burthen, or
lay too heavy a load upon their Minds; or if
they have, yet have not been <hi>pressed beyond
measure,</hi> remember what a Blessing they enjoy
by the use of that Reason which others do want,
and are deprived of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:62720:18"/>
Let those that have not by necessities, or other
occasions, been exposed to the Temptations of
Vagrancy and Dissolute Courses, have some
compassion for those that have, and contribute
toward the <hi>pulling of such out of the Fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed if every one did but make the case of
others their own; every one that can, would
be more or less a Benefactor to such Foundations
as these are.</p>
            <p>And this Argument would be improv'd, if we
consider'd, That all we have is of meer Gift,
and we are but Stewards and Dispensers of it;
it being for a time deposited in our hands for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Excellent Ends and Uses; and that we are
all accountable another Day to God the Supreme
Lord and Donor, and indeed Proprietor of all.
And thus our Saviour represents it, <hi>Matt.</hi> 25.
31, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When the Son of man shall come in his glory,
and all the Holy Angels with him, then shall he sit
upon the Throne of his Glory; and before him shall
be gathered all Nations — Then shall the King say
unto them on his right hand, Come ye blessed of my
Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from
the Foundation of the World: For I was an hungred,
and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave
me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
and ye cloathed me: I was sick, and ye visited me:
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62720:19"/>
I was in prison, and ye came unto me.</hi> He concludes,
<hi>Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of
these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What greater encouragement, than to have our
Saviour himself a Debtor to us, when we are all
so to Almighty God! What greater than to have
an Eternal Reward for dispensing of that to
others, which we our selves receive! What
greater than to be assured that the Son of Man
Himself, when he shall come in his Glory, will
be ready to receive us, and that He will then
say to us, <hi>Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit
the Kingdom prepared for you!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall Conclude with that of the Apostle,
who sums up all as to our Duty and Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 17, 18, 19.</note>
               <hi>Charge them that are rich in this world,
that they be not high-minded, nor trust in uncertain
riches, but in the Living God, who giveth us richly
all things to Enjoy: That they do Good, that
they be rich in good Works, ready to Distribute,
willing to Communicate; Laying up in store for
themselves a good foundation against the time to
come, that they may lay hold on Eternal Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which God of his Infinite Mercy grant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us, through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Amen.</hi>
