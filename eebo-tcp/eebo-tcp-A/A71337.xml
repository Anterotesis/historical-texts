            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

After Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon they all came by way of Proce≈ø≈øion from the Church to the Colledge, ≈øinging P≈øalms: Then one of the Profe≈ø≈øors of Divinity made an Oration in the common School. The Magi≈øtrates of <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> with all other per≈øons of quality, were ≈øet in the middle of the Court near to the Fountain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Theatre hung all about with the Hangings which King <hi>James</hi> the fourth be≈øtowed upon the Colledge, with other ornaments and Garlands, and Crowns of flowers of all ≈øorts; the Picture of the King was in the middle, and upon his left hand his Excellency General <hi>Monk,</hi> becau≈øe the ≈øpeakers had in their Orations ≈øomething to ≈øpeak as to them: the ≈øtairs about, the windows, and all the Court below, were ≈øo full of ≈øpectators, that I thought there had ≈øcarcely been ≈øo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny people in the parts about us. Upon this Theatre were ≈øet all the Ma≈øters and Students in order in their Gowns. In the fir≈øt place the Principal prayed and prai≈øed God, and did ≈øhew the hearers, that there were five young men, Students, to ≈øpeak in that place one after another: which was according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done; and indeed they did it very gravely and reverent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The ≈øubject of their Oration was as followeth: The fir≈øt ≈øpoke of the great happine≈øs which <hi>Scotland</hi> enjoyed under Kings ≈øince the days of <hi>Fergus</hi> the fir≈øt, until the time of the late troubles. The ≈øecond ≈øpoke of the mi≈øeries the Nations ≈øuffered by the late Kings Murther, the pre≈øent Kings re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval

The fifth had a gratulatory Oration for the Kings return. After they had ended, there was a Latine Hymn of about eighty lines, very harmoniou≈øly and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ≈øung, and at the end of every fourth line, <hi>Vivat Rex Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolus, vivat.</hi> It is incredible to know how joyful the people of all ranks were, who were pre≈øent: the people of this poor Town did te≈øtifie their un≈øpeakable joy all the night with Bonfires, ringing of Bells, playing on Mu≈øical In≈øtruments, and dancings, yet without the lea≈øt debauchery of drinking; ≈øuch an influence hath his Maje≈øties ≈øobriety upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
