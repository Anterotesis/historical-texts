            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE Humble Petition of <hi>William Laud</hi> Arch-biſhop of Canterbury, and now priſoner in the Tower. To the Lords and Commons aſſembled in Parliament, that this grave Aſſembly would permit or give way, that the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner might not be tranſported into New England with Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> in regard of his age.</head>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat your Petitioners conſtant ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude here in this place, hath given him time to conſider of Your Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners ſelf and his actions, eſpecially the latter, which as they had divers motives and ends from whence they ſprung and whither they tended, ſo according to them your
<pb facs="tcp:111147:3"/>
Petitioner was generally cenſured; your humble Petitioner therefore will here lay downe what your Petitioner did labour for, and upon what grounds, that every one may ſee that humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents are not alwaies proſperous in their events, for which your Petitioner is now exceedingly troubled and grieved, humbly deſiring that your Petitioners preſent ſufferings and ſorrow may bee conſidered in mercy and compaſſion. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is chiefly laid unto your Petitioners charge that your Petitioner ſought and endeavoured to change the preſent Religion, and inſtead thereof to introduce Innovation and Popery; which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe was ſo odious and hatefull to the people, that being once poſſeſſed of this opinion, they generally cryed downe your Petitioners purpoſes and intents, who knowing the great diverſity of Religions which have beene and are in the World, and the ſtrange fantaſticall exorbitancy of ſome of them, which agreeing in many things and in their chiefe principles and foundations, doe yet exceedingly differ in many points and Tenets which they doe ſeverally hold and maintaine.</p>
            <p>Vpon thoſe conſiderations your Petitioner
<pb facs="tcp:111147:3"/>
thought it would become his place being Arch-Biſhop of Canterbury, and Primate of all Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, to ſhew a fervent zeale to Chriſtianity, in reconciling as much as might bee the Proteſtant and Cotholique Religion together, that though the principles of both were inconſiſtent, and in many things farre different, yet they might be in ſome ſort made conformable the one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and be brought at leaſt to as neare a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance as poſſible could any way bee deviſed, that ſo they ſhould agree in ſuch points as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly they varied about. And your Petitioner having made this the Ground-worke of your pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners labours, hoping that if your petitioner could effect that which your petitioner had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, her Majeſty ſeeing that all differences of opinion are not Fundamentall and of Faith, might be reconciled in ſome ſort, her Majeſty would more eaſily be drawne to adhere and joyn with our Church; ſo your petitioners end and purpoſe of all your petitioners endeavours was not Innovation of Religion, but to worke ſuch a conformation and likeneſſe in both, that her Majeſties opinion might be drawne on and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to embrace the Truth, holding thereby to be
<pb facs="tcp:111147:4"/>
a ſpeedy meanes of her Majeſties converſion. If therefore your petitioners hearty zeale to Gods glory, and her Majeſties converſion to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Faith by that meanes and may which your petitioner intended, did not worke that great and good effect in her Majeſty as was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, nor the petitioners endeavours in that kind were held fitting and agreeable to the peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners dignity and place: your petitioner doth emplore this grave and Honourable Aſſembly, that in Mercy, not in Iudgement your compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be ſhewed, in pardoning thoſe errours wherein your petitioner hath offended. For all men, eſpecially ſuch as are advanced to theſe emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Honours, (which your petitioner lately en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed) are ſubject to the common condition of humane frailety in matters of Judgement, ſhewing themſelves in the greateſt eſtate to bee but men ready to erre, and fall from the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe wherein time and favour had inveſted them, and that moſt commonly in age, wherein your petitioner deeply ſtepped forward even to the yeares of 68. all his deſires having proceeded con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary and thwart to thoſe grounds whereon they were builded.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:111147:4"/>
Your Petitioner therefore humbly beſeeches, that in his age and laſt part of his Life, this grave and Honourable Counſell, now Aſſembled in high Court of Parliament would looke upon him in mercy, and not permit or ſuffer your Petitioner to bee tranſported, to endure the hazard of the Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
