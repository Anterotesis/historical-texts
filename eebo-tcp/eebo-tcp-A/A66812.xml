            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>bnegation of the Popes charity, and admiration of his unparalelled cruelty, that being granted, to have a power so to do, dot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>r chosen Ensign.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Doctor <hi>Baily</hi> holding conference with the King touching the Popes Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogancy, alluding to Christs answer to his Apostles; He that desires to bear Rule, let him be the least amongst you, and therefore the Pope doth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times colourably term himself servant of servants: to which the King reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that by such an inference he could prove the Pope to be humbly minded, to which the Doctour answered, that he did not alwayes so account himself, save only when he had purpose to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, otherwise he esteemed himself Lord of Lords. His Majesties determination was, that the Popes calling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self servant of servants, was rather in a more strict and peculiar sense, as that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63979:6"/>
he was a servant of his Church, and so by consequence, the servant of the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, but towards all other, Lord of Lords; so likewise to be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed Catholick, is to be a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, but to be a <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick is it, which marreth the matter.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That whereas our Saviour saith it is as easie for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle, as for a rich man to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Kingdome of heaven, the Pope perverteth that saying, for that none shall have no pardons, but such as pay for them: so consequenly the rich are more easie to enter into heaven then the poore, because the one can have pardons when he will, but the other is not able to purchase it, and thereupon his Majesty concluded the Pope to be justly called a Merchant of mens souls, as is set forth in the 18. of the <hi>Revelation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. His Majesty observed a quaint inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatory put to a jealous Lover, out of that famous Comedy of <hi>Ignoramus,</hi> the which his Majesty highly commended, <hi>viz.</hi> whether he desired most, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be termed <hi>Publius Cornelius,</hi> or <hi>Cornelius Tacitus;</hi> in further approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of which Comedy, besides in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position and dislike of another Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63979:7"/>
performed and acted before his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty by the Scholars of the University of <hi>Oxford,</hi> that as in <hi>Cambridge</hi> one <hi>Sleep</hi> made him wake; so in <hi>Oxford,</hi> one <hi>Wake</hi> made him sleep.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That Tobacco was the lively image &amp; pattern of hell, for that it had by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion in it all the parts and vices of the world wherby hell may be gained; to wit first it was a smoak, so are the vanities of this world. Secondly, it delighteth them who take it, so do the pleasures of the world delight the men of the world. Thirdly, it maketh men drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and light in the head; so do the vanities of the world, men are drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken therewith. Fourthly, he that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth Tobacco, saith he cannot leave it, it doth bewitch him: even so the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of the world make men loath to leave them, they are for the most part so inchanted with them: and further, besides all this, it is like hell in the very substance of it; for it is a stinking loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som thing, and so is hell: and further, his Majesty professed, that were he to invite the Devil to a dinner, he should have these three dishes. 1. a Pig, 2. a Pole of Ling, and Mustard, and 3. a pipe of Tobacco for digestare.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:63979:7"/>
7. That he had heard an old Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster say, touching conformity, that it would be a scandal for him to conform, and yet will allow that his son may do it, as if he living a fool all his life, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red so to die.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Heaven is governed by order, and all good Angels there; nay, hell it self could not well subsist without some or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the very devils are divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Legions, and have their Captains. How can any Society then upon earth subsist without order or degrees?</p>
            <p n="9">9. That the often mentioning of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> in the Scripture, is to signifie that we should celebrate the memory of good men above others, and of all men above beasts.</p>
            <p n="10">10. That all humane Laws cannot be perfect, but that some must rest in the discretion of the Judge, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though an innocent man do perish thereby: as his Majesty further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that a Jury may cast upon evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and a Judge may give a just sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, yet the party innocent.</p>
            <p n="11">11. We should not be like the Puritans in our prayers, who speak to God, as to their fellows, and sit at Christs Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as with their companions. Let us
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63979:8"/>
joyn reverence with the sweet confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence we have in Gods love.</p>
            <p n="12">12. That no man can thrive that keepeth a whore at Rack and Manger, to sit openly with justification. That to rove is proper to expresse the action of the body, but to rave is an action of the mind.</p>
            <p n="13">13. His Majesty would not admit publick, disputation betwixt twelve Papists, and twelve Protestants, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self being chosen umpire, because he might lose more, that would not be satisfied, then he could win, although the Papists side were convicted: and further his Majesty declared, that in 88, he almost converted a Papist, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till my new convert heard of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi> Invasion.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Vertue is easier then vice, or the essential difference betwixt vice and vertue, is truth and falshood; and it is easier and lesse pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>s to tell truth then a lye, and for vices of the senses custom is all in all; for to one that hath lived honestly, it is as much shame to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit sin, as for another to abstain.</p>
            <p n="15">15. The art of Physicians is very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, for I doubt not but for every disease, there is in nature a several sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:63979:8"/>
if they could find it out, so that these compounds do rather shew their ignorance then their knowledge.</p>
            <p n="16">16. The Popish Religion is like <hi>

            <p n="17">17. That Monarchicall Government by Secular Kings and Priests, is the only Ordinance of God, and the Republick only a depraved institution of man for depraved ends, as appears manifestly by the whole current of Scripture, even from <hi>Adam</hi> to the Primitive Church after Christ.</p>
            <p n="18">18. A Preacher preaching before his Majesty on the 29. Psalm, that I offend not in my tongue, he could have wished might have bin before so many women, because they are most unruly therein.</p>
            <p n="19">19. That there were many wayes to find out truth besides evidence of reall witnesse, as it was in the businesse of Mr. <hi>Haddock,</hi> who was reputed good, yet was found at last a great oflender, whereupon his Majesty replyed, the case in him was not after his meaning,

and thereupon insisted further to exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifie his offence, confessing the same to be high &amp; capital in respect of God and man, meaning Mr. <hi>Haddock,</hi> who preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his sleep, that his Majesty did God and the Countrey good service, in discovering that man. 2.

That his Majesty discovered him by his own papers and notes which were brought unto the King, the which Mr. <hi>Haddock</hi> confessed to be his own hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing, and the notes of his Sermon which men say he preached in his sleep, but for answer thereunto, said he only noted his Sermons first in writing, and so in the night dreamed thereof, and of the same thing that he had penned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but by his answer his Majesty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced him upon his own experience concerning dreams and visions in the night, that things studied or mentioned in the day time may be dreamed of in the night, but always irregularly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

That Mr. <hi>Haddocks</hi> sin being granted for liberty, and good, then would all sinnes bee protected and allowed, as blasphemy against God, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son against the King, slander against any man; and at last all defended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der colour of being asleep: and further his Majesty declared his opinion, that the reason that moved the aforesaid Mr. <hi>Haddock</hi> to put in practice his prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching in his sleep did proceed from two natural infirmities, to which he was subject, the one was stammering in speech, so finding himself more ready to speak being quiet in his bed, and his eyes shut from any object to trouble his mind, he could utter himself more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly. The second reason was his pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice to talk in his sleep: these two as the King conceived, put him on to that soul practise and illusion of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans.</p>

            <p n="25">25. If the Pope may erre as a man, but not as a Pope, I would know why the Pope doth not instruct or reform the man, or wherefore the man doth not require the Popes instruction.</p>
            <p n="26">26. Not only the deliverance of the Jews till they came to the Land of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, but even their daily preservation was miraculous; for there was never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny noted plague in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> though it stood in a hot Climate, which had it been, would have endangered the whole Nation, it being to assemble thither twice every year of necessity.</p>

            <p n="32">32.

            <p n="34">34. That he would never use any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Argument to convince the Papists of their opinion of Miracles, but by their own Doctrine, whereunto most of their miracles are altogether repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: as for example, a fable they have that the picture of our Lady should stir; their Doctrine is, that these images are but Representative, now what dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion appeareth between their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and their Doctrine?</p>
            <p n="35">35.

            <p n="1">1 AT the Kings being at <hi>Ragland,</hi> there were some information given of some Gentlemen of the County, who were supposed to have done his Majesty many ill offices, by withdrawing the hearts of the people from his Majesty: these men thus accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, were ordered to be laid hold of, and it was executed accordingly, and they being brought before his Majesty, it was moved by some, that they should be forthwith tryed by a Commission of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> others advised his Majesty they should be sent to <hi>Hereford,</hi> and there to be kept in safe custody, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til further consultation might be had concerning them, they excusing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:63979:25"/>
as well as they could, one of them protesting his innocency with tears in his eyes; the King ordered, that he should be released, being always prone to lean to pity rather than Justice, and to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable rather than rigid constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The King coming back from <hi>Aler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geveny,</hi> where this was put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, told the Marquess what he had done, and that when he saw them speak so honestly, he could not but give some credit to their words, so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by tears, and withal told the Marquess that he had onely sent them to prison, whereupon the Marquess said, what to do? to poyson that Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison? Sir, you should have done well to have heard their accusations, and then to have shewed what mercy you pleased. The King told him, that he heard they were accused by some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Faction, as to themselves, who out of distast they bore to one another upon old grudges, would be apt to charge them more home than the nature of their offences had deserved: to whom the Marquess made this return, <hi>Well Sir, you may chance to gain you the Kingdom of heaven by such doings as these, but if ever you get the Kingdom of</hi> England, <hi>by such</hi>

            <p n="2">2. The Marquess had a mind to tell the King as handsomly as he could of some of his (as he thought) faults, and thus he contrived his plot against the time, that his Majesty was wont to give his Lordship a visit, as commonly he u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to do after dinner, his Lordship had the book of <hi>John Gower</hi> lying before him on the Table, the King casting his eye upon the book, told the Marquess, that he had never seen it before, O said the Marquess, it is a book of books, which if your Majesty had been well versed in, it would have made you a King of Kings; Why so my Lord, said the King? Why said the Marquess, here is let down how <hi>Aristotle</hi> brought up and instructed <hi>Alexander</hi> the great in all his iudiments and principles belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to a Prince; and under the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Aristotle,</hi> he read the King such a lesson, that all the stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders by were amazed at his boldness, and the King supposing that he had gone further than his Text would have given him leave, asked the Marquess, whether he had his lesson by heart, or whether he spake out of the book: the Marquess replyed, Sir, if you could
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:63979:26"/>
read my heart, it may be, you might find it there, or if your Majesty please to get it by heart, I will lead you my book, which latter proffer the King accepted of, and did borrow it: nay said the Marquess, I will lend it you upon these conditions, 1. That you read it, 2. That you make use of it: but perceiving how some of the new made Lords fretted and bit the thumbs, at certain passages in the Marquesses Discourse he thought a little to please his Majesty, though he displeased them, the men who were so much displeased already, protesting unto his Majesty, that no man was so much for the abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power of a King, as <hi>Aristotle,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring the book out of the Kings hand, he told the King he would shew him one remarkable passage to that purpose, turning to that place, that had this verse, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <l>A King can kill, a King can save,</l>

            <p>Whereupon there were divers new made Lords, who slank out of the room, which the King observing, told the Marquess, My Lord, at this rate you will drive away all my Nobility;

the Marquess replyed, I protest unto your Majesty, I am as new a made Lord, as any of them all, but I was never cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led knave and rogue so much in all my life, as I have been since I received this last honour, and why should not they bear their shares?</p>

The Marquess travelling, was as he thought surprized by enemies, but recovering the top of a high Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, by the advantage of the ground he could see the enemy marching off an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other way, at which sight the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess dwelt with his eyes a little lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger upon that object, then the L. <hi>John Somerset</hi> his son thought convenient, whereunto the Marquess made this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, <hi>O son, I love to see my own danger, especially when it is marching of.</hi>

            <p n="4">4. The Marquess travelling on the way, happened to come to a place wherein was seen a miracle, which the tradition of those parts reports to have been wrought, occasioned upon Saint <hi>Davids</hi> preaching unto 3000 people, who that he might the better be heard, the ground it is said to rise up in a round knob, whereupon Saint <hi>David</hi> pitched his Cross whereon he leaned whilst he was preaching, which Cross

was yet standing with some words, and letters, which time had made unlegible, and that Saint <hi>David</hi> had caused a Church to be erected in that place, as a memorial of so great a miracle: this relation made the Marquess very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to view the place, the Church, and the Cross, and standing in the Church yard, every man endeavoured to make something of the obliterated superscription, and no man could, for there were only these worn pieces of characters to be seen, <hi>viz.

means to help me to the true understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Scripture.

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:63979:29"/>
that loved the King, and that there was such a Nobleman, who had served the King in no small measure, who was likely to ly in the streets for want of a Lodging: the young man shewed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately great respect, telling his Lordship, that he should be welcom to his Mothers house, who kept a poor Inn. So into the house his retinue went, finding it a most lamentable receptacle for such a person, yet better than none at all; the Parlour where my Lord was to lye, was a soft and loose ground, wherein you might sink up to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles every step, the top of the house being thatched with ill thrasht straw, the corn was left in the straw, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the house was thatched, grew, and was all as green as grass.

civilities of his own house, for which my Lord gave him many and hearty thanks, breaking forth into this Meditation, <hi>Lord what a thing this misunderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is! I warrant you might but the King and Parliament confer together, as you and I have done, there might be as right an understanding betwixt them, as there is now betwixt you and I, some body hath told the Parliament, that the King was an enemy, and their believing of him to be such, hathwrought all the jealousies which are come to these di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions, the Parliament being now in such a case as I my self am, having green ears over their heads, and false ground under their feet.</hi>

carelessness of servants left behind him 1000 l. in gold, being hid under a Bench, and forgot to be taken away, the money was never missed until they came to their journies end at night, and it being told my Lord that so much was missing, and where they had left it, my Lord made no other words of it but these, you talk of a cheap reckoning, but I never paid so dearly for a nights Lodging in all my life: who would think that a man should leave so much money behind him in such a lousie Inn? One that stood by told the Marquess, that it was a hundred to one if ever he heard of his money again, it was such a beggarly house, O peace, said the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess, if they will not be known of the money, you shall see it will be a brave Inn in a short time: this mony was sent after, and very honestly restored, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered into the Messengers hands that came for it. Being brought unto the Marquess, there was much wondring at the honesty of the woman of the house, others praised the whole town seeing it was generally known.

The Marquess journeying on his way to <hi>Ragland,</hi> happened to come to a place that was called <hi>Strata del stori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> in <hi>Cardiganshire,</hi> which made him say that he was brought to the West Indies already, an old ruined, but sometimes a most famous Monastery, with whose ruines was built a pretty tolerable <hi>Welsh</hi> Gentlemans house, where my Lord lodged that night, in which house there was shown an old old woman, who was credibly reported to have been living, and of years able to remember when the Monastery was in its flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condition, and to have been at Mass oftentimes when the place was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited by Monks and Friars: this strange relation was no sooner carried up, and presented to my Lords ears, but my Lord was as greedy to glut his eys with such an object, as they to fil his ears with the relation: the woman being sent for came, coming, the Marquess questioned her concerning the manner of the Monks behaviour, both in their Service, their Orders, Habits, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms, and all other particulars, who gave his Lordship so exact an account, that he believed it to be true, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed that it must needs be so; and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioning
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:63979:31"/>
of her further, about her age, she said she was an hundred years of age: then the Marquess asked her, And what when the Religion altered, you altered with the Religion? she answered, no in truth Master, I staid to see whether or no the people of the new religion would be better than the people of the old, and I could see nothing, but grew worse and worse, &amp; charity to wax colder &amp; col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, &amp; so kept me to my old religion, I thank God, and by the grace of God mean to live and die in it. The Marquess turned to the Gentleman of the house, who was a Protestant, and asked him whether or no, she had been noted for a Papist all her life, the Gentleman said, that she had, &amp; could never be brought from it; and that she would oftentimes steal into the Church alone with her beads, and there she would be praying by her self; the Marquess dismissed her for the present, but after Suppen sent for her again, and had some more private conference with her; amongst other things he asked her how she did to serve God, and when she had seen a Priest last, when she had been at Mass, or received the Sacrament: the woman answered, that she had not seen a Priest
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:63979:32"/>
not in sixty years, but she did her of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice daily, and never missed, and once a year upon <hi>Goodfriday</hi> she received the Sacrament at the Parsons hands, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto God, that seeing she could not attain unto the means, that God would make the Parson a Priest to her at that day, which she believing God Almighties judgment to be such, as that he did hear her prayers. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess fell into such a fit of Laughter, and then into such expressions of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that it was rare to see him trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported into such extreams, so at last he ended in pity and commiseration, which wrought in the Marquess this effect, and to the poor woman this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended advantage; the Marquess gave her ten pieces of old Gold, telling her, that if she would go with him to <hi>Rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and spend the remainder of her dayes with him she should be welcom, and there enjoy the means of bringing her thither, where now she had but a little way to go, meaning heaven. The woman fell a crying, saying over and over again constantly, God hath sent him, God hath sent him, he was a good man, and so she departed, resolving to go as soon as possible toward <hi>Rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

told that the matter should be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before him, and if any affront was given, he should receive satisfaction: whereupon being come within the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, the Lieutenant was sent for, who told the General, that though he knew him to be a General, yet as a Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er he was not to take any notice of him, until such time as he had decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himself, which when he did, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected him accordingly: &amp; further said that rewards he had seen given on the like occasion, but never knew it a fault before: all this would not serve, but the General said he was affronted, and must have satisfaction, and so took his leave.

What was the reason he kept his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber so much, and did not come abroad?

Sir, said the Marquess, I have received a very good character of you, they say you are very learned in the Law, I would very fain ask you one question, Any thing my Lord, said the Lawyer, that lies within my poor ability. I pray, said the Marquess, who was the first man that ever had a <hi>Dedimus potesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem</hi> granted unto him? the Lawyer was so confounded, that he knew not what to say for a long time: at last he made a long and learned discourse concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the original of that Writ, and the Marquess gave him the hearing, but when he had done, he told him,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:63979:44"/>
that hè came far short of the original thereof; for <hi>Adam</hi> was the first, that ever had fulness of power granted unto him, <hi>viz.</hi> when God gave him power to subdue the earth, and to have domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over every living creature. The Lawyer thankt his Lordship, and told him, that he thought the Law had not been so antient.

There was a new married cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple presented before the Marquess, the Bride a goodly proper woman, her face well feitured, an excellent eye she had, but was pitifully disfigured with the small Pox: the Marquess looking much upon her, and saying nothing to her a long while, we all knew that Silence was in labour for some notable Production, at last he advanceth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the young Bride, and asked he

Gentlewoman, Do you know why it is said, that God Almighty created man and builded woman? the Gentlewoman somewhat out of countenance, answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, No indeed, my Lord: The Marquess asked her again, Do you know why you women are called Housewives? I think my Lord said the Bride, because good wives should keep at home, and not gad abroad. It is a good answer said the Marquess, but not the right, for women may be bad wives at home as well as abroad. The answer to my first question is, women are not said to be made as <hi>Adam</hi> was, which only signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies plain work, but to be built, which signifies curiosity and co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>trivance, and therefore as to my second question, a woman is called a housewife, because she is a house out of which all the Royal Families of Kings and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors derive their extract: neither are you only compared unto houses, but unto Cities, Kingdoms, Churches, and Common-wealths. But do you know what house you are like? No in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed my Lord, said the Bride, why then I will tell you, when God builded the first woman, he made her his storehouse wherein he laid up all the race of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:63979:45"/>
wherewith he replenishad the whole earth, but I must tell you Lady, God Almighty did not make you coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches nor waggons, that you should al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies be gadding abroad. Whereat the Bridegroom made answer, My Lord, I think you for this, I hope my wife will remember it. My Lord, said the young Bride, you will read such a lecture to my husband, that he will never let me go abroad: O Lady said the Marquesse, he must not debar you of that liberty, provided, that you will never go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, but when you go like the Snail, who seldom stirs abroad, but whilst that blessing the dew of Heaven is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth, that she may gather bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and by her greatest care, and equal management, still carrys here house up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her back. O my Lord said she, if I should go abroad like the Snail, I should carry a house upon my back, and horns in my forehead. No Lady said the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess, though she forks at you, yet they are no horns, the Snail can soon draw them in if you touch them, which no horned creature can perform, but she car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rys them in her head, to teach you what you should provide &amp; bear in your mind against you go to hay-making: but the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:63979:46"/>
Marquess fearing that he had a little displeased her, he thought to make her amends by the following discourse. Sir, said he to the Bridegroom, you know I have compared your wife to a building, and I must commend your choice, for said he, alluding to her dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figurement, a goodly house must not be chosen by the smoothness or white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the wall, for such an one may be but a dairy-house, or a milk-house, nor according to the colours or paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the outside, for such an one may be but a Tavern or an Alehouse; but if I see a house that is lofty and stately built, and have fair windows though the outside be but rough cast, yet I am sure there are goodly rooms within: and so both parties were well pleased.</p>

Papist: the Marquess met them at the Castle gate, and desired to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they came to take away his mony, seeing they intended to disarm him; they answered no, but what they did, was because he was a Recusant, he said he was a Peer of the Realm, and no convict Recusant, and therefore the Law could not in reason take notice of any such things, and further, some sharp and dubious words coming from the Marquess, they were at last willing to take his word, but the Marquess not willing to part with them on such easie terms, having before resolved to return them one fright for another, which he thus effected; having carried them up and down the Castle, he at length brought them over a high bridge that arched over the Moat, that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Castle and the great Tower, wherein the Lord <hi>Herbert</hi> had lately contrived certain water-works, which when the several Engins and Wheels were to be set a going, much quantity of water through the hollow convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of the <hi>aquaeducts</hi> were to be let down from the top of the high Tower, which upon the first entrance of these wonderful Asinegoes, the Marquess
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:63979:49"/>
had given order that these catarrhacts should begin to fall, which made such a fearful and hideous noise, by reason of the hollowness of the Tower, and the neighbouring ecchoes of the Castle, and the waters that were between, and round them both, that there was such a roaring as if the mouth of Hell had been wide open, and all the Devils had been conjured up, that the poor silly men stood so amaz'd, as if they had been half dead, and yet they saw no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: At last as the plot was laid, up comes a man staring, &amp; running, crying out before he came at them, <hi>Lock to your selves my Masters, for the Lions are got loose:</hi> whereupon the searchers gave us such a loose, that they tumbled so over one another down the stairs, that it was thought one half of them had broken their necks, never looking behind them till they were sure they had got out of sight of the Castle.</p>
            <p n="48">48. There was a Colonel, who came unto the Marquess after the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle was delivered, whom the Marquess very well received until such time, as the Colonel desired reparation of certain losses which he had sustained by
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:63979:50"/>
his son <hi>Clamorgan,</hi> the Marquess pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him not to call him to an account for other folks, for he had enough to do to answer for himself: whereupon the Colonel clapt his hat upon his head, and sate himself down in a chair of State, which was upon my Lords right hand, which the Marquess ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving, gently said unto one of his servants, <hi>I pray reach him the footstool.</hi>

            <p n="49">49. After much conference betwixt the Marquess, and General <hi>Fairfax,</hi> wherein many things were requested of the General by the Marquess, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as he thought himself happy in the attainment, his Lordship was pleased to make a merry Petition to the General as he was taking his leave, <hi>viz.</hi> in the behalf of a couple of pigeons, which were wont to come to his hand, and feed out of it constantly, in whose be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half he desired the General that he would be pleased to give him his Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for them, fearing the little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that he should have over his Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in that behalf. To which the General said, I am glad to see your Lordship so merry. Oh said the Marquess, you have given me no other cause, and as
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:63979:50"/>
hasty as you are, you shall not go until I have told you a story.</p>
            <p>There were two men going up <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born</hi> in a Cart to be hanged, one of them being very merry and jocond, gave of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence unto the other, who was as sad and dejected, insomuch as that the downcast man said unto the other, I wonder brother that you can be so fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, considering the business that we are going about. Tush, answered the other, thou art a fool, thou wentest a thie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and never thought what would become of thee, wherefore being on a sudden surprized thou fallest into such a shaking fit, that I am ashamed to see thee in that condition, whereas I was resolved to be hanged before ever I fell to stealing; which is the reason, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing happening strange, or unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I go so composed unto my death: so said the Marquess, <hi>I resolved to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go whatsoever, even the worst of evils that you were able to lay upon me, before ever I took up arms for my Soveraign, and therefore wonder not that I am so merry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="50">50. There was a <hi>Romane</hi> Catholick, who had been converted unto the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Religion, and giving the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess of <hi>Worcester</hi> a visit, the Marquess
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:63979:51"/>
questioned him very seriously concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his revolt, and the ground of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion; the Convert told him, that the ground of his departure from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> was because she had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from her self. You say very well said the Marques, but how do you prove that? to which demand the convert made this reply, <hi>viz.</hi> the Scriptures tell me so: whereupon the Marquess called for a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, giving command it should be a Bible <hi>cum privilegio Regis,</hi> which being brought unto him, he said unto the Gentleman, I will see whether it wil tell me any such thing, and holding it in his hands a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty while, at last he opened the Bible, and held it open as long, then he protested unto the afresaid Gentleman, that the Bible told him no such matter, and that he believed it to be so ful of truth, &amp; sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, and that it respected the salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mens souls so much, that if there were any such thing, it would in charity (with which it was so fully fraught) do no less than acquaint him also with it. To which the Gentleman replied: My Lord, it is not the letter, cover or paper that tells me so, it is the sense &amp; mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I cry you mercy said the Marquess, who shall be judge of the meaning,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:63979:51"/>
you or I? to whom the Gentleman gave his Lordship this answer, who comes nearest the truth. Then said the Marquess, how should we know who comes nearest the truth? we shall know that said the Gentleman by the word it self. I have told you said the Marquess, that the word it self sayes nothing: then said the Gentleman, there is a perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive spirit that directs every man &amp; leads them into all truth who are seekers of her meerly for love of her self. Indeed said the Marquess, I have heard of such a Sect that is newly sprung up, who go under the name of Seekers, but I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be on the finders side. To which the Gentleman made answer. <hi>Seek &amp; ye shall find.</hi> To which my L. replied, you must have day-light, or candle-light, or else your eys will do you no good: the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman made answer, that Christ was so easie to be found of all that sought him, that if we did but grope after him, we should find him. I said the Marquess, you say wel, but not when there is a light in the room; &amp; thereupon the Marquess en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred upon a large discourse, perswading the gentleman to return to his mother a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, whose arms were always open rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to embrace all that should return into her bosom, to whom the gentleman said
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:63979:52"/>
if I should turn now I should be despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed on all sides. <hi>Oh,</hi> said the Marquess, <hi>if that be all, then all is nothing, for what can any man say more to you, than this, you have been abroad, and you are come home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain?</hi>
            </p>

The time being come, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Windsor</hi> must now fit the fatal destiny of <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Ragland,</hi> like a thunder-bolt, that splits down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards from the higher to the lower branch of the same tree, <hi>viz.</hi> that he should live long, and lose all that Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison, had the honour to make good the rear hope for a time, when the main body of the whole Kingdom was quite forlorn; and in her last for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate and successfully sally, like a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Taper to make one great blaze be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore she went out, in which exploit some of her Gentlemen were so gallant, as to bring home Trophies of her victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Colours, which were no sooner dishevelled, but they spread to gather with themselves the praises of these ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, these being presented to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess, he turned away his face, saying, <hi>These are no natural colours, they are but bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed,</hi> intimating how unnatural the war was, and how soon these Colours must be restored.</p>

            </p>
            <p n="53">53. The Marquess a little before he dyed, having addressed himself to the House of Peers, and having found very hard usage from them, broke forth into these expressions. Oh said he, When the Noblest and highest element, Courts the noise of their Waves, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I do believe, that they are so near unto their end, that as weak as I am, there is Physick to be had, if a man could find it to prolong my days, that I might outlive their honours. Not many hours before he died, reflecting
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:63979:53"/>
upon the Articles that he had waived upon the Surrender of <hi>Ragland</hi> into the Parliaments hands, Ah Doctor said he, to Doctor <hi>Baily,</hi> If I had made use of the Articles, which you had procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in my behalf, I had not been now so near unto the end of my life, and the beginning of my happiness, I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sook life, liberty &amp; estate which I might have had, and threw my self upon their mercy, which when I had done, if to seise upon all my goods, to pull down my house, to sell my estate, and to send for up such a weak body, as mine was, so enseebled by diseases in the dead of winter, and the Winter of mine age, be merciful, What are they whose mercies are so cruel? Neither do I expect that they should stop at all this, for I fear they will persecute me after death: you tell me, that when I am dead, you will petition the Parliament for money to bury me, then will they appoint those who will dispose of the time and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of my burial; and you shall see, that they (being it is so near the good time) will cause me to be buried ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the directory in spight of <hi>Christmas</hi> day upon <hi>Christmas:</hi> and so they did.</p>
