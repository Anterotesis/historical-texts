            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hat is sicknesse?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> It is, according to Philosophie and Phisicke, a priuation of health, or an ill dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position and passion in the body contrary to nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> But how define you it according to diuinitie?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> It is Gods rod and instrument to chastice vs for our sinnes, and to put vs in minde of our mortalitie, it is the herbinger and messenger of death, and by vertue of Christs death, it is a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and spéedy passage to euerlasting life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> From whence, or from what cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses doe sicknesses and diseases procéede?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They procéede from God as the inflicter and imposer of them, for he is <note place="margin">Amos. 3. 6.</note>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18107:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the author of the euill of punishment; <note place="margin">Ioh. 5. 14.</note> but they arise from sinne, as the de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How can God, that is simplye good, yea goodnesse it selfe, be the cause of euill, namely, sicknesse, diseases, paine, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Gods goodnesse and iustice doth, and may, very well consort together in the beléeuers, for as God in his iustice doth correct his children for their diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, so doth he temper and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie it with his mercy and goodnesse, that these afflictions are finite, tolerable, and tend both to the temporall and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall good and profit of his children. <hi>Psal. 25. v. 10 Rom. 8. v. 28.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What vse are we to make of this point?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Wée must first descend into our selues, acknowledge our sinne and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse, yea and condemne our selues for it. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 31.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we must be so farre of from fretting, murmuring &amp; repining against God, that we must iustifie God in all his chasticements, &amp; not to require the reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18107:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of them, for they are alwayes good and holy, albeit we doe not alwayes sée the particular reason of them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we committing our selues to Gods will, must earnestly entreate the Lord to restore vs to our former health; or else to receiue vs to his euerlasting kingdome.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obi.</hi> But God hath in his beloued Sonne Christ Iesus, forgiuen, yea and taken away the guilt, dominion &amp; curse of sinne, which is the cause of their sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, and why then doth he not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all remooue the effect, <hi>viz.</hi> sicknesse, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases, &amp;c?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Albeit the guilt, curse, and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of sinne be remooued from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeuers, yet the reliques and stumpes of sinne remaine, and inherent corruption is but in part abolished, and therefore so long as we liue in this world; the <note place="margin">2. Sam. 12.</note> Lord must néeds, (more or lesse) one way or other, fatherly chastice &amp; exercise vs. 1. <hi>Cor. 11. 31. Heb. 12. v. 6. &amp; 8.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obi.</hi> 2. But Gods children cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes finde out the peculiar sinnes that are the proper and immediate causes of their sicknesses and diseases?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18107:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yet not withstanding, we must sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, accuse and condemne our selues, and withall iustifie and cléere the Lord; for there is some secret and hidden sinne of pride, worldlinesse, lust, enuie, vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, oppression, &amp;c. for which wee are corrected, albeit it bee not presently made knowne vnto vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What course must we take to finde out this <hi>Achan</hi> or secret corruption?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> We must (as I will in the next Chapter more fully shew, examine our selues by the strict rule of Gods law.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we must entreate the Lord by prayer to reueale the sinne vnto vs. Thirdly and lastly, we must take notice of the checkes of our conscience, yea and <note place="margin">Psal. 16. 7.</note> the taunts &amp; reproches of our enimies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What are the principall ends why God laieth sicknesses, diseases, aches, &amp;c. vpon his children?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They are principally these foure, to witt, mortification and preuention of sinne; triall and exercise of Gods graces in vs; manifestation of Gods glorr; and lastly our saluation and eternall happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But to speake of each of these ends
<pb facs="tcp:18107:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
particularly (yet briefely) how doth God mortifie and preuent sinne by sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> First God doth hereby declare his iustice and anger against sinne past, and present, that his children might be more <note place="margin">Iob. 13. 26 Lam 3 41. Psal. 30. v. 6.</note> effectually stirred vp to search them out, consider of them, and be sory for them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, God hereby doth correct the pride of prosperitie, and remooue all vaine confidence in carnall wisedome, riches, beautie, friends; that we may waite patiently and onely vpon his power, truth, &amp; promises, and learne to séeke for heauenly things, so that by this his correction, he taketh away the myst of errour from our eyes, purgeth our hearts from the drosse of corruption, and fanneth vs from the chaffe of sinne, and hereby prepareth vs either for health or heauen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Doth God by sicknesse, and the like afflictions preuent sinne to come?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes certainly: thus pride was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented in blessed <hi>Paul. 2 Cor. 12. ver. 7. &amp; 8</hi> Security in <hi>Dauid Psal.</hi> 30. 6. 7. and neglect of preparation in the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18107:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
1. <hi>Cor. 11. v. 31.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is the second end of Gods chasticements?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To trie and make knowne to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues <note place="margin">Deut. 8. 2. &amp; 13. 3.</note> and to others their faith, hope, patience, repentance, constancie, yea to exercise, quicken, and encrease in them these and other graces, that they may, be thankfull to God for them, and may be as mirrours and lamps vnto others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Are not also by this triall and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise, decayed graces recouered?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is most certaine; for hereby, deadnesse and drowsinesse of heart is <note place="margin">Cant. 5. 5. 6 Hos. 5. 15.</note> cured; and men are mooued more fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uently to séeke and pray vnto God then they did before, <hi>Psal.</hi> 30. 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is the third end?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The declaration and manifestation of Gods power, glory and goodnesse in their deliuerance, either by life or death. <hi>Iohn</hi> 9. <hi>vers.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is the last end?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> After that God hath reformed, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and exercised them, and made them to relie wholy vpon him, and to waite &amp; wish for their saluation, to bring them by death into the heauenly <hi>Canaan,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18107:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
where they shall haue immediate fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship, and raigne with Christ for euer-more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q</hi> Séeing that sicknesses, diseases, and the like chasticements haue such comfortable and blessed effects and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uents in Gods children, what is the reason, why they should not be the same in the wicked and vngodly?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The difference lieth first in their persons, the elect are accepted of God, and therefore like the good golde, they are made more pure and bright by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitations and afflictions; but the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of the wicked and vnbeléeuers are not accepted with God, and therefore like drosse they are not purified but consumed by the fire of affliction. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, in his secret counsaile he neuer intended the amendment &amp; saluation of the reprobate, neither do they reprobate euer by pure meanes and in pure sort, euer intend the same, but the case is far otherwise with Gods children, whom alone God hath pre-ordained to saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> That we may be partakers of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinne, what conditions are there required on our part?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Two conditions principally. First fréely and truely to confesse our sinnes vnto God, with contrition of <note place="margin">Psal. 51, ve. 3, and 4.</note> heart, and to acknowledge that wée are worthy of all, both temporall and
<pb facs="tcp:18107:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
eternall plagues and punishments. <note place="margin">Dan. 9, 6 Luk. 18, 13 Iob. 19. 25</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly wee must firmely beléeue that Christ is our only and all sufficient redéemer and mediator, and we must by the eye of faith behold, and by the hand of faith apply the promises of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, particularly to our selues &amp; soules.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Que.</hi> Is confession of sinne necessary for the obtaining of the pardon of sinne?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is simply necessary, for it is the very foundation and first degrée of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
               <p>Secondly it is the way and meane of our iustification before God, for hee will neuer pardon vs vntill we accuse our selues, nor pronounce and accept vs for iust vntill we condemne our selues. <hi>Pro.</hi> 28.</p>
               <p>Lastly, without confession of sinne no pardon can be procured. <note place="margin">1 Ioh. 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But are sinnes of leauing good things, and duties vnperformed to bee confessed, such as are neglect of prayer, want of zeale in Gods cause, defect of charity and compassion: omitting of thankes-giuing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes verily, as we haue examples in <hi>Daniel, Paul,</hi> and others, <hi>Dani. 9. v. 13. Rom. 7. v. 15.</hi> Secondly, we offend as much in omitting of these, séeing Gods lawe doth require them, as in commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting euill.

                  <p>Secondly, as those maladies and diseases, (especially which are certaine fore-runners of death at hand) are most dangerous that are least felt: so those sinnes, whereof wée haue no touch, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse, nor repentance, are most to bée feared, for they send men vnawares, posting and packing to hell.</p>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> That life is no true life, for such an vnhappy condition deserueth rather to be called death then life, for the damned are vniuersall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated from the fauour and glory of GOD, and are vtterly and for euer <note place="margin">2.

                  <hi>A.</hi> It is not such by it owne nature,
<pb facs="tcp:18107:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and in it selfe, but it is changed, and the property thereof is altered by Christ his death; in so much that of a curse and punishment it is turned into a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and fatherly correction, and is made a narrow entrance and a short cut into euerlasting life.

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> These, and the like effects, are not to be assigned to any deliberate purpose of the godly, but onely to be imputed, to melancholy, burning feuers, the cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and other violent diseases, and (in a word) to their infirmity onely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What conclude you hence?</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> We are not vpon these occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, rashly to iudge them, much lesse to condemne them.

               <p>Secondly, we must not like arrogant Critikes condemne them of impiety and hypocrisie, but wee must iudge cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably of them, as wée would bée delt with-all in the like case.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The Saints and seruants of God, when death approacheth, are most of all and more then other people, tempted assaulted, and molested by sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan how then can death be good?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> First, it is no good argument, hence to conclude that they are none of Gods seruants but rather the contrary: they are Gods deere children, <hi>ergo</hi> sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan must now or neuer séeke to sift them, whereas the wicked are his own and refist him not.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I answere that it is not generally true that the Godly are thus in death assaulted for many with <hi>Sime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> die as a torch or fire-brand without <note place="margin">Luk. 2. ve. 29.</note> sense of paine. <hi>Isay.</hi> 57.</p>

                  <hi>Qu.</hi> What is the fift and last excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against death?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Sudden death is an euill, but many men die suddainely, ergo death is euill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ques.</hi> How answere you this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I answere to the first propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, that death is not euill, because
<pb facs="tcp:18107:32"/>
it is suddaine (for the last iudgement shall come suddainely, and yet it is not euill) but good to GODS chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; but because it findeth onely the wicked vnrepentant and vnprepared. <hi>Luk. 12. v. 20. and 21.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, CHRIST by his death and suffering hath taken away the course of the lawe and the feare of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation which is the very sting of death, therefore death though neuer so suddaine, is not accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to the true beléeuers, but a speedie conueyance of them into the hauen of eternall rest and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
               <p>Lastly séeing that with <hi>Ezechias</hi> wee haue no lease of our life, if any of GODS seruants, with good <hi>Mephibosheth,</hi> and <hi>Iobs</hi> Godly chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and the young infantes that <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rode</hi> caused to bée massacred, die sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainely and violently, wée must iudge charitably and the best of them; for the manner and time of the ending our life is onely in Gods power and not in our owne will. <note place="margin">Psal. 31. 15</note>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Although this be a ticklish point, and albeit <hi>Saul, Achitophell</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi> that killed themselues bée noted in scripture for reprobates, and albeit they that late violent hands on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues neuer for the instant may bée iudged to thinke on hell torments, yet séeing that God neuer finally forsaketh his chosen, seeing that his mercy is bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomlesse, and that he may giue them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance (for ought we know to the contrary) at the last point of time, let vs if they haue béene formerly good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors, iudge the best of them, and pray vnto God that he would giue vs grace neuer to yéeld to the like temptations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But why must not a man kill him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> First because he shall not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by escape misery but runne into it. Secondly, it is not lawfull to kill ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ease him of his paine, muchlesse to kill a mans selfe.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> First auricular or eare-confession made to a Priest.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the receiuing of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist or hoast.</p>

Thirdly, as the leprous person by <note place="margin">Leu. 13. 45 46.</note> reason of the contagion of the disease might not be resorted vnto, so it fareth with him that is visited with the plague.</p>

the power ouer death.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Yes, for it putteth vs in mind of the greeuousnesse of our sinnes, and what wee deserue if God should deale strictly with vs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it holdeth men backe in their extremities from laying violent hands on themselues; for they that are thus desperately minded do not so much as once thinke of Hell and the torments of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ques.</hi> Séeing the feare of death is thus profitable, why must the sicke bée armed against the feare of it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> Because death approaching, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall feare doth most of all shew forth it selfe, astonish the sicke mans senses, and causeth despaire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> What are the meanes to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort him against the feare of death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> They are of two sorts namely practises and meditations.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18107:51"/>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What are the practises?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They are two. First the sicke par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties must not so much feare death, as cast their eyes vpon euerlasting life.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they must consider death not in the bright coullor of the lawe, for then our weake eyes cannot endure to behold it, <hi>for then it is a cruell sergeant armed with the anger and curse of God;</hi> nor in it selfe, for then it is (to men vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate) the very entrance into hell, yea hell mouth it selfe.</p>
               <p>But we must take from it the feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full maske and visard of the law, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it as it is set forth in the mixt and tempered coullor of the Gospell, and as it is changed by Christ his death, who hath not onely deaded it by his owne death, but also quickned it, so that it is to the beléeuers bodie a tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and a swéete sléepe, and to their soules, the gate of saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wherby they enter into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> possession of life euerlasting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Why must not a Christian man vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>measurably feare death?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> First, because it is to the godly the end of all euils, all sinne, errour and misery.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18107:51"/>
Secondly, because after death he pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth presently to a better state.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, because he hath immediate fellowship and communion with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Trinity, with the elect Angels and the glorified Saints.</p>

                     <hi>An.</hi> Yes, so the end and scope of his life be to doe acceptable seruice to God, and to further and maintaine Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion <note place="margin">Isay 38. 18.</note> and glory, and labour to help and forward other mens faith, &amp;c. <hi>Phil, 1. 24. 25.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>An.</hi> It is altogether accursed and fearefull.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> First because it is the dissoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of nature, and the wages of sinne.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, for that by reason of Gods iustice pursuing the wicked in euery place, and because they haue no peace of conscience, death is to them the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of euerlasting damnation. For they féele no mitttigation of theyr gréefe in death, nor haue so much as the least hope and expectation of ease and deliuerance.</p>
