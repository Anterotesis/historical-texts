            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Hence it is that the Lord seemeth to be angry with all, &amp; ready to reject some of his Churches, which to him

are as a generation of his wrath. Have not his people set up their abominations, in the house which is called by his name to pollute it?

And are they not about the swallowing up of the protestant interest, as in a moment? And what is the Church of Christ doing, all this while? Doth she

stir up her selfe to call upon her head &amp; husband, or to awake the watch man of Isreal, who neither slumbereth nor sleepeth? Is she upon her watch-tower, looking out &amp; guarding against the approaching enemy, or observing his motions? Ah not so! She is fast a sleepe, while the enemy is within the walls.

            <p>In these following sheets, there is some account given thee, of the sad &amp; deplorable condition of the Church of <hi>Christ</hi> in <hi>Scotland.</hi> It is wonderfull to see how variously Satan doth assault the Churches of God, some one way, some another: That crasty &amp; cunning adversary, doth suite his baits &amp; sna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res to the severall complexions of people &amp; Churches, against which he opposeth himselfe: Some have the tryall of cruel mockings, &amp; scourgings: others meet with bonds &amp; impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment, and others with triall of some other Kinde; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst some, Satan doth raise cruel &amp; bloody persecutions, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers he endeavoureth to draw away from their stedfastness &amp; zeale, by ensnareing allurements: a third sort he invadeth with all his troupes &amp; forces at once: And thus is the lately glorious Church of Scotland tried this day. Upon the one hand he raiseth up against her, men of corrupt mindes destitute of the truth, who make sharpe their tounges like a Serpent, &amp; under whose lips is the poison of adders. These have vented &amp; doe vent most bitter slanders &amp; reproaches against her, &amp; the way of reformation, which the hand of God wrought in her: On the other hand, he hath raised within her, a most cruel perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution by a popish prelaticall &amp; malignant party, setting them on with rage, against all who desire to keepe themselves unspot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, &amp; free of the contagions of this evill time, forceing some by cruel &amp; sore persecution, &amp; ensnareing others, that are more sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, deceiving &amp; drawing them into their n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Yet hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till (for which, the name of the Lord is alone to be Magnified) the designes &amp; devices of these <hi>Matchiavellian Ahitophels,</hi> &amp; bloody persecuters have not taken such effect, as they either wished or expected. It is true, many (Alas! too too many) have been carried away with the streame, and willingly walked after the commandement to the great dishonour of God, amazement

of nations about, rejoycing of the heart of the ungodly, &amp; to the great stumbling &amp; grief, of the truely tender &amp; godly in that, land, so as the defection of that Church may be matter of asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment to the present &amp; after generations: Yet it is her mercy that there are not a few in her, whom conscience, &amp; Christian tenderness in their walke, hath exposed to sad sufferings who the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row grace have resolved to keep their garments cleane; &amp; to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the peace of a good conscience, to all the treasures of <hi>Egypt,</hi> holding faith &amp; a good conscience, of which many make ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack, &amp; in the Lord their master's strength, to hold fast their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, &amp; to maintaine their ground, though bonds &amp; afflictions should abide them: The justification &amp; defence of such, is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended scope of this following treatise: Which how well man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged is left to thy discretion to Judge.</p>
            <p>It is like, such a worthy &amp; noble cause may suffer prejudice through the weakness of him who here doth appeare in its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, wherefore it is wished that some more able pen be engadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this worke, for clearing to the world the present sad case of that Church, And vindicating her from aspersions &amp; calumnies, which her adversaries laboure to fasten upon her. To speak in the justification of such a mother, would well become the most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent of her Children; It would be so far from being below them, &amp; a disparagement, that they might justly account it their glory, to lay out themselves in the out most of their strength &amp; parts, for the defence of such a cause, when so few doe avow, &amp; openly declare their owning of, &amp; adherence to it: But un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the Lord shall be pleased to stir up &amp; set on worke some more able, &amp; to prompt them with a spirit of zeale &amp; courage for such an undertaking, thou must rest satisfied with this poor essay, for the time. Only thou mayest give charity to the author, that it was not his intention to wronge, in the least, so glorious a cause; But seeing none else did undertake or appeare in it (for any thing known to him) He desired, in a few words (that something (though it should prove little better then nothing) might be said in &amp; for it) to make it known how worthy it were the thoughts &amp; paines of a more able head &amp; hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to deale in.</p>

Many, It is like, will be the exceptions taken at this piece, &amp; moe then can now either be thought upon or obviated, such as are most obvious, wee shall endeavour to remove, by briefly touching &amp; answering them.</p>
            <p>Some may think it strange, that a piece of this nature, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as appeareth from its straine, for satisfaction of Churches abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad, cometh not forth in a latine-dresse. It is true, it was intended at first, &amp; so moulded &amp; drawn up, as it might be published to the world in latine, for the satisfying of strangers &amp; Churches abroad<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But upon second thoughts, When the case of the suffering peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in that Church &amp; Kingdome was considered; It was thought expedient, that it should first be published in English; That such as had hithertil valiantly resisted, to the losse of their meanes &amp; liberty, might be strengthened &amp; confirmed in their resolution. And the more encouraged to endure afflictions when they should see that they did suffer for righteousness sake, &amp; that they were called thereto of God: &amp; that others might be quickened to fol low their footsteps who had so cheerfully gone before them in the way. Having hereby their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doubts cleared, scruples re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, &amp; their judgements convinced in the point of duety: &amp; this was found even necessary at such a time, when their temptations did abound, their faintings were like to grow; &amp; when such as were able to give advice in difficult cases, &amp; to encourage the weak, were thrust away. So the consulting of their present necessity did hasten it forth in this dresse: Besides, that many both in England, &amp; Ireland, may receive information &amp; edification hereby, of which they should have been deprived, if it had been published in latine. Afterward, if it be thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary &amp; expedient, this or some other, may be published to the world in Latine, with lesse prejudice to the present sufferers.</p>
            <p>Next, some may think that severall questions here handled, might have been forborne, especially such as touch upon the civil Magistrat his power &amp; prerogative, seing in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity he shall be the more enraged thereby.

Yea the reader shall find upon narrow search, considering the matter, that much more plainnesse &amp; sharpenesse might have been used in such a dispute; And that as much inoffensivenes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And that purposely many particulars, which might have been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, have beene passed by: And that no particulars have been pitched upon, but such as are still upon record in their printed Acts, or were publickly acted &amp; concluded in their publick meetings: And as to these consequences drawn from their Acts &amp; actings, which appeare dangerous &amp; destructive to the throne, let such as have laid the foundation in the premis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es see to that, <hi>ex veris nilnisi verum:</hi> Who give twice two, cannot be justly offended with any who shall thence conclude that they give foure; &amp; whether the Consequences be cleare &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyable or not, the reader now hath it before him to judge: As to the Kings supremacy in Church matters, no truely reformed divine, can justly take any exception against that which is here spoken upon that head. The priviledges of the crowne &amp; scepter of christ should be highly valued, &amp; earnestly contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, by all, who call &amp; account themselves Christians; &amp; a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course

            <p>Further, it is like, some would have wished, that the historical part contained in the first &amp; second sections, had been much more large.

there had been any other way for vindicating such as doe suffer upon the account of these particulars, and for preventing the fall of others into the same snare; this way had never been made choise of; &amp; therefore seeing nothing is said upon any sinfull or sinister designe, these brethren &amp; Christians, will take this smiting as a Kindness, &amp; these reproofs as an excellent oyle that will not break the head, They will not take in evil part, the discovery here made; They are of another spi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>It is beyond all question, the Particulars here asserted shall meet with much contradiction from men of corrupt mindes, whose principles will lead them to oppose what here is spoken in vindication of truth, &amp; of the honest sufferers of Christ: And upon that account it may be expected that the same honour shall be done to this, which hath been done to other more worthy pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, viz. that it shall be committed to the fire, there to receive a quick dispatch &amp; answer, which will be so far from lessening the credit of the booke, that it will render it much more desire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, &amp; confirme the weake concerning the truth of the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars here spoken to, &amp; of the unanswerableness of the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments here made use of; &amp; so the authors expectations shall be fully answered.

            <p n="1">1. By what is said here, thou mayest see that the cause thou sufferest for, is the good old cause: That same Spirit which acted the Prelats &amp; other enemies of the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> from the beginning, is now raging in her present enemies: The same designe is &amp; hath been endeavoured &amp; driven on, all a longs. How various so ever the pretexts &amp; colours have been under which they have sought to cover themselves, the cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hath proved too narrow for them; first prelacy &amp; then popery was intend first &amp; last. It is the same cause, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of which, Christs worthies of old did act &amp; suffer, so long as they could stand, &amp; in the defence whereof, they were not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayed to beare the displeasure of King &amp; court, &amp; to hazard life &amp; liberty, &amp; all which wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> dear unto them: If then the same Spirit doth act &amp; worke in the enemies of the Church now, which did act &amp; worke in their predecessours of old, pray thou that the same Spirit of God, may act thee &amp; all the faithfull of the land, which did appeare in the worthy &amp; valiant Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions of old, whether thou be called to act or suffer for his sake.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Thou mayest know from what is here related, that the cause for which thou art now suffering, was brought very low before these times, And that the adversaries thereof have often got up to a great height, yet the good cause hath got above them: And how Acts of Parliament, one after another, &amp; all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of the adversary, to seale the grave, And to make it sure, could not keep this cause of Christ from a glorious resurrection;

Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth (might the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> then have said) many a time have they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted me from my youth, yet have they not prevailed against me. The plowers plowed upon my back, &amp; made long their furrowes, The Lord is righteous, he hath cut asunder the coards of the wicked. And shall it not yet hold true, that all they who hate Zion shall be confounded &amp; turned back, &amp; be made as the grasse upon the house topes, which withereth be fore it be grown up? There is no cause of despondency of spirit, or of giving over the cause as lost: there is hope in Israel concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this matter, his people may still hope &amp; trust in his name, who hath wrought salvation of old. He who did put that wicked party to shame &amp; confusion of face, in former times, &amp; made the name of Prelats to stink, &amp; their posterity to be as curs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vagabonds wandering up &amp; down, bearing the marks of god's displeasure, still liveth &amp; reigneth, &amp; doth no more approve of the Ungodly of this generation, Nor of their more then barbarous carriage, who have laboured to out strip their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessours in perfidious treachery; Then he did them, who of old did set themselves against the Lord &amp; his Christ, yea much lesse: It is true, the men of this generation think they have pins for stopping of such holes, which their predecessours could not stop; but he who sitteth in the heavens doth laugh at them, &amp; hath them in derision; He seeth that their day is coming. It is easie with him, to cause the sword which they have drawn to slay such as are of upright conversation, enter into their own hearts; &amp; to break the bowes which they have bent to cast down the poor &amp; needy; Our God liveth, &amp; reigneth &amp; shall reigne, let Kings of clay rage as they will. Therefore cast not away your confidence which hath a great recompence of reward, for yee have need of patience that after ye have done the will of God ye may rece<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p n="3">3. Thou mayestsee, that this cause &amp; work, against which the wicked have conspired &amp; set themselves, hath been signally owned &amp; approved of by the Lord, for which he hath fought, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

a name among the nations: And who knoweth what God will yet doe for his great name, which, in this day of rebuke &amp; blasphemy, is greatly reproached? Hath he begun &amp; will he not finish his worke? It is true, the provocations of his people doe keep them long in the wildernes; yet he who hath fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently wrought for his names sake, that it should not be blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed amongst the heathen, will still be tender of the same, &amp; sith, at this day, there is much blasphemy belched forth, by persons of all ranks against the great &amp; glorious works of God, as much if not more, then at any time or in any age, wherein hath been lesse light; The people of God need not be hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, much lesse conclude, That God who is jealous of his own glory, &amp; will not give it to another, will suffer it now to be given to the devil, on whom his work is fathered: But rather will certanely be avenged on those prodigiously &amp; unparallelably impious &amp; sacrilegious persons. How dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a thing is it, to say that Christ casteth out devils, by <hi>Beel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub</hi> the prince of devils!</p>
            <p n="4">4. Thou mayest see clearly, that the cause, for which thou dost now suffer is the cause of Christ: His enemies would pul the crown from off his head, &amp; the scepter out of his hand, &amp; by this meanes, make him no King in &amp; over his Church, &amp; consequently no mediatour; For as mediatour, he is a King in &amp; over his Kingdome, that is his Church, in which he dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, &amp; over which he ruleth with his scepter of righteousnesse. They will not have his Kingdome, a free Kingdome, &amp; conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently they will not have him a free King. They will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low to him, the liberty of appoynting or instituteing his own officers, or to rule his Kingdome by his owne lawes, courts ordinances, &amp; censures; Nor will they suffer Church-admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrations, to be performed in his name &amp; authority, as, in reason, they ought to be, if he be King &amp; head of his Church. He must have no more liberty to exerce his jurisdiction, by the Ministery of his inferiour officers, within their domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons &amp; territories, then seemeth good in their eyes. The dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of his house, must be exerced only in so far as they think
<pb facs="tcp:65203:10"/>
good to permit: And thus it is undeny able that they look on Christ as an evil neighbour, &amp; as no good friend to <hi>Caesar:</hi> They think his Kingdom is of this world, &amp; therefore it must have no place within any of their Kingdomes &amp; territories. Thus thou seest, that, in end, the controversy cometh to this. Whether Christ, or man shall reigne in the Church, as head &amp; supream Governour thereof: And whether the interest of Christ or of man shall be preferred: And to preferre the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of a man unto the interest of Christ, hath heretofore been accounted malignancy of the deepest dye. But what shall become of this controversie, &amp; how shall it end? Are they, or shall they be able to put our Lord from his throne, &amp; out of his possession? No; he is set upon the holy hill <hi>Zion</hi> by a mighty hand, &amp; his inheritance among the heathen is given to him, by a surer deed of gift, then that he should be so easily put from it: He hath a rod of yron that will dash in pieces, as a potters vessel; all his enemies, be they never so great, &amp; migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; He is too strong a party for all the potèntats &amp; mighty ones of the earth: &amp; therefore, this which is the grand controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy of those times, shall &amp; must be decided, in favours of those who stand upon Christ's side, &amp; maintaine his right: he is a strong captaine, &amp; will run thorow all the hosts of his adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: Christ's sufferers then, may rejoyce; what ever affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction they are or can be put to endure, for this cause, which is a cause that doth highly concerne Christ the royall prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives of his crown &amp; Kingdome, &amp; his glory, as he is the only head of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p n="8">8. Thou mayest likewise have arguments put into thy mouth, whereby to defend thine own practices, in standing to thy former principles, &amp; stope the mouth of thine adversaries: before thou was willing to suffer for Christ &amp; his interest, though thou could not disput much for him &amp; his truth, &amp; that was a great evidence of love: And now thou mayest get some help in disputing for the truth, by the arguments set down in the following sheets; And the few arguments which thou will finde there, may bring others to thy minde, &amp; thus thou mayest be helped to meet thine adversary, without fear.</p>
            <p n="9">9. But if these adversaries be of such a disposition, as to take advantage of thy speaking or argueing for truth, to bring thee into trouble, &amp; therefore in prudence thou will think it best to keep silence: Thou mavest here by be confirmed, in thine own minde, of the unlawfulnesse of such courses, as the current of the times would draw thee unto, as it doth others; &amp; how unjustly thou art persecuted for refuseing to comply with such sinfull wayes: And further, because it is like, the malice of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan &amp; his instruments, will not rest here, but they will still

            <p n="11">11. Thou mayest see these Covenants, against which, in this degenerate age, reproach cannot sufficiently be poured forth, vindicated; And the lands, obliged &amp; Covenanted lands before the Lord, what ever course hath been taken by higher powers to loose the obligation. This Gordian Knot will not be gotten so easily loosed, as some would imagine: People may think to close their eyes, &amp; then reason themselves out of the obligation ofa Covenant &amp; oath taken before the Lord, &amp; so cast themselves at liberty; But that will only wreeth the heavy yoke ofGods curse straiter about their neck. It is no small matter of admiration to hear how basely many men do speak of these holy bonds, &amp; sacred Covenants. But let men (who take pleasure in venting the venome that is within) say what they will, <hi>Scotland</hi> hath no cause to be ashamed of these Covenants. It was a sweet day when the nationall Covenant, which had been long buried in oblivion, was raised out of the dust, &amp; renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And it may be, <hi>Scotland</hi> shall have as sweet a day, when both that Covenant &amp; the solemne league &amp; Covenant, which now lyeth buried under a heep of the ashes of contempt &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
<pb facs="tcp:65203:13"/>
shall be raised up, &amp; renewed with great acclamation of joy. It is true, this seemeth not to be very probable now; but Scotlands covenanted God liveth, &amp; his arme is not shortened. There was not very great probability of renewing the nationall Covenant some few years before, when the prelats were tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing at pleasure, &amp; no man durst so much as complaine of any injury they did; It is easie with God to put Spirit &amp; courage in people, make them stand upon their feet, &amp; become an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great army, who were before but dry bones, yea very dry bones: &amp; howbeit now that league &amp; Cov. be looked upon as a device contrived purposely to overturne the throne; Yet (as it hath already proven so againe) it may prove, as sure a pillar for the throne, as any; &amp; as effectuall a meane to preserve the same from being overturned, as any other. But (Christian reader) by what thou will see in the following sheets, thou Mayest easily perceive, that it is both a sinfull &amp; dangerous thing to break Covenant, &amp; a sin which heathens have scarred at And therefore remember thy Covenants and vowes made unto the most high, let not the speaches nor carriage of others, who think they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not exceed, in casting out the venome of their heart, against these Covenants, lessen thine estimation of them, but rath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er increase the same; And the more thou hear others cry down these Covenants as null, keep thy self under, their tye, so much the more carefully: Make conscience of studying these Covenants, &amp; the duties unto which, thou standest bound before the Lord, by vertue thereof: It is true, thou art no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

May it not come to passe, that these Zelots for prelacy, shall weary of this yoke, &amp; wish as earnestly for the day, wherein they may be delivered from this bondage, as ever they did longe for the day, wherein they might have their necks brought from under the sweet &amp; gentle yoke of Christ? May not the peers &amp; body of the Land come at length to supplicate his majesty, to loose this yoke from off their necks, when their Scottish (some time generous) spirits, shall not be able any longer to endure such unsufferable slavery: This is not impossible, nay nor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable: Though it were to be wished, That they might Act that way, upon some other principles, principles of piety &amp; godly tendernesse; That, seèing their injury done to Christ, in shaking off his governement &amp; lawes, willingly following after the commandements of men, &amp; mourning therefore, they might lament after the Lord, &amp; seek him with the whole heart, &amp; engadge themselves in a Covenant with the Lord, to be for him to the utmost of their power, &amp; bring the land back againe to seek the Lord God of their fathers, that he may have mercy upon them &amp; heal their backslideings, &amp; builde up the walls of his Church, &amp; make her a praise in the earth.</p>

               <p>It is true <hi>Spotiswood,</hi> in his late History, would make the world beleeve that in the dayes of the <hi>Culdees</hi> there was no go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement in the Church of Scotland but Prelaticall; because <hi>Boetius</hi> sayeth that <hi>[those priests or Culdees, were wont, for their better governement, to elect some out of their number, by common suffrage, to be chief &amp; principall among them, without whose knowledge, &amp; consent nothing was done in any mater of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, &amp; that the person so elected, was called Scotorum Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copus]</hi> &amp; farther, as if his bare dissenting from <hi>Buchan:</hi> would be enongh to blast the reputation &amp; weaken the credite of that Renowned Historian, he sayeth p. 7. of his History <hi>[what war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant he (i. e.

But from the instruction of the Scots in the faith, to conclude that the Church af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it was gathered, had no other for me of governement, will not stand with reason, for be it as they speak, that by the travelle of some pions monks the Scots were first converted unto Christ it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be said, that the Church was ruled by monks, seing, long after those times, it was not permitted to monks to medle with the maters of the Church, nor were they reckoned among the Clergy]</hi> thus he. To which it is easily answered. 1. That the sole word of a late Historian, &amp; of an Excommunicated for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sworne Prelate speaking in his own cause will have lesse weight with every rationall man, then the Testimony of so many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous &amp; eminent Historyographers, known through the world. 2. All the Prelat's, logick will not conclude from these words of <hi>Boetius</hi> that there was Episcopall governement among the Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees, if <hi>Boetius</hi> himself may be heard, whom all are bound to beleeve better then this Prelate, who reasoneth according to his skill for he lib. 7. c. 28. sayeth <hi>[erat Palladius primus omnium &amp;c. i. e. Palladius was the first of all who did bear holy Magistracy among the Scots, being made Bishop by the great Pope]</hi> thus he affirmeth clearly, that Palladius was the first, who had Episcopall Power, or exercised a Magistraticall domineering power in Church maters. 3. Could Buchanan, a man many
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65203:21"/>
stages beyond the Arch-prelate, know no reason or ground for what he said but what this Archprelat could perceave who had no will to open his Eyes? 4. As this Archprelat doeth wrong his own credite as an Historian, when without warrant he contradicteth so many famous Historians; so doeth he discover much weakness in reasoning; for to say that the monks did not governe the Church befor <hi>Palladius</hi> landed in Scotland, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause after Palladius came, they were putt out of all accompt &amp; got not liberty to do so, is such a ridiculous consequence, as can hardly be paralleled; as if one should reason now, &amp; say the Church of Scotland was not governed by Ministers befor the year 1661. becaus after Bishops got all the power into their hands, the Ministers had no power of governement in the Church. Much more might be said here against the reasoning of this late Historian, were it sitt to insist upon every such frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous argument of his.</p>
               <p>So then, from these forocited Historians, &amp; from <hi>Baronius</hi> in his Annal: it appeareth that the Church of Scotland was se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall hundereths of years without a domineering Prelate, &amp; after this time that this <hi>Palladius</hi> came, she was still in a decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condition, through the increase of popery, which at length did overspread the whole land, in which Romish darkness she did ly untill about the year 1494.</p>
               <p>About which time the Lord began to visite that poor Church with his salvation &amp; to cause some light of the Gospel to break up in severall places of the land: but no sooner did the light appear, but as soon did those Antichristian Prelats &amp; vassals of the Pope begin to rage, &amp; to raise persecution against the young pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of the truth, &amp; followers of the lamb, &amp; so with fire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; faggot they sought to destroy all who prosessed the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, untill about the year 1550. when, notwithstanding of all this rage &amp; cruelty of the Beast, &amp; his followers, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the trueth did spread through the land, &amp; a farther worke of Reformation, began to he caryed on, by worthies whom the Lord raised up, such as famous <hi>Mr Knox</hi> &amp; others, who were singularly owned of God in that work. Though <hi>Mr Spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiswood,</hi> according to his usuall maner of mistaking the works

of God, &amp; of venting his enmity to piety &amp; purity, is pleased in the 60. page of his history to say that <hi>this Reformation was vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent &amp; disorderly.</hi> And albert at that time the Queen was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devouring, by all means possible, to keep up the Idolatry of Rome, &amp; to suppresse the Reformed Religion; so powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did the Lord, in his goodness, assist these worthves, that in the year 1560. there was a large Confession of Faith drawn up at the command of the Parlament which did conveen that year, in which Confession all the Popish errours were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, &amp; after, it was exhibited to the Parliament &amp; there read, &amp; when it was read, the Prelats who were there present had not one word to speak against it, which when the Earle of <hi>Marshall</hi> did perceave he said <hi>[Seing the Bishops (who by their learning can,</hi> &amp; <hi>for the zeal they should have to the truth, would gain say, if they knew any things repugnant) say nothing against the said Confession, I cannot but thinke that it is the very truth of God]</hi> Thus this Confession was openly avowed &amp; professed by this Parliament, as is clear by the act. 6. parl. 1.

It is true the late Historian the Archprelate would make the world beleeve that the Superintendents, which are spoken of in that Book of Discipline, were nothing else but Bishops. But his fondo mistake in this, will appear to any who will but consider these particulars 1. What the thoughts were which this Archpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late had of this book which treateth of those Superintendents: as. 1. That it was framed by <hi>Iohn Knox,</hi> &amp; famous <hi>Knox</hi> first nor last was never a friend to prelats or prelacy. 2. he sayeth <hi>that it was done in imitation of reformed Churches such as Geneva and those of Germany,</hi> &amp; these Churches knew no prelats. 3. He sayeth <hi>[it was no better nor a dreame &amp; so could never take effect,]</hi> but had it been an establishing of Prelacy, it had been no dreame in his accompt, and he would have said, that it had taken effect. 4. He willed &amp; wished that <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> had retained the old Policie, &amp; so this book contained a policie distinct from the old policie, &amp; a Policie which was not the same with Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy. 2. What the thoughts were which such as were for the Reformed Religion, had of it: Now they looked on it, as the Discipline of the ancient Church, &amp; therefor after it was drawn up, they did supplicate the Parliament for the <hi>restau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Discipline of the ancient Church, &amp; for the discharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Popes usurpation</hi> &amp; <hi>of all that Discipline, which did flow there from,</hi> as being inconsistent with the Discipline of the ancient Church, &amp; with the Discipline contained in that book. But 3. It cannot enter into the heart of any rationall man to think that these Reformers were so inconsiderate, as<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

It was not po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Prelats alone, which they were labouring to turn out of the Church of Christ, for, when some of those who had been popish Prelats before, had relinquished Popery, &amp; embraced the Reformed Religion, and had subscribed unto the book of Discipline, as <hi>Mr Gordoun</hi> in Galloway, yet they would not suffer such to exerce the power of superintendents. <hi>Mr Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doun</hi> with all his moyen could not obtaine that power, so that <hi>Spotiswood</hi> when he sayeth in his Latin Pamphlet called <hi>(Refuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio libelli de Regimine Ecclesiae Scoticanae,</hi> pag. 4. &amp; also in the

But 5. so cautious were the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, that they would not acknowledge those to be Bishops, either in name, or thing, for as their worke was extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, so they gave them an extraordinary name: They would not suffer any who had been Bishops before in time of popery, to enjoy the place &amp; power of a Superintendent, least the power &amp; place might be abused, &amp; at length degenerate unto the old power of Prelats; but even in those bounds, where such lived, did appoint others to Superintend, as <hi>Mr Pont</hi> in <hi>Galloway.</hi> They would not divide the bounds of those Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents according to the Prelats Dioceses, but after another manner. They devided the land into ten parts, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the edification &amp; advantage of the poor people. These Superintendents were chosen by the consent of the whole bounds, which they were to visite. They were not consecrated, but onely sett apart to that worke by preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp; prayer, as is to be seen in the order prefixed to the old Psalme-books. They were tryed &amp; examined by the Ministers of these bounds. They had other Ministers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct with them, when they ordained any. Nather had they sole power of Excommunication, for Reformed Churches had power by the Book of Discipline to excommunicate the contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macious: &amp; the tractate of Excommunication prefixed to some old Psalme-books sheweth that they might do it without the advyce of the Superintendent. They were subject to the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Ministers &amp; Elders of the Province, who might depose them in some cases.

               <p>But Satan, envying the faire beginnings of this Infant Church, stirred up some of the Statesmen against her, who, having possession of Church rents, &amp; Prelats Benefices, &amp; fearing to lose the same, did therefor devyse a way for establis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hing themselves in the possession of those Church rents, by getting in some <hi>Tulchan</hi> Bishops, (as they were called) who might have the name of the whole Benefice, but rest contented with a small part to themselves, leaving the rest in the hands of these Nobles, and accordingly the Earle of <hi>Morton</hi> stirred up the Earle of <hi>Marr</hi> then Viceroy, to convocate an Assembly at <hi>Leith,</hi> by the means of the Superintendent of <hi>Angus:</hi> who when they did meet Jan. 12. 1571 did nominate six of their number to meet with six appoynted by the councill, &amp; these twelve did condiscend to severall things tending to the setting up of Prelats.

               <p>When this Second Book of discipline is thus appoven, by the Nationall Assembly, after prayer &amp; fasting they appoint some of their number to exhibite it to his Maj. to the end he might add his approbation thereunto: Unto whom the King (being then about 13. years of age) did promise <hi>[that he would be a proctor unto the Church]</hi> &amp; caused some of his Counsellours conferr with those Ministers upon that business, (the heads of which conference were once insert in the Registers of the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, but <hi>Anno</hi> 1584. when the Court had power of the Registers, those leaves were taken a way, &amp; seen no more, as shall be cleared hereafter) and again <hi>Anno</hi> 1579. the King wrote unto the Nationall Assembly desiring <hi>[a farther consultation upon the heads, on which his Commissioners and their delegats did not accord the last year, to the end that when all the particulars are fully aggreed upon, they might be approven in the ensueing Parliament]</hi> &amp; in the mean time the Assemblies are going on, prohibiting any moe bishops to be chosen, &amp; ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such as were chosen, to submit themselves to the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Generall Assembly, under the paine of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, &amp; accordingly some then, &amp; all of them afterward, did submit.

                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1581. in Aprile at <hi>Glasgow</hi> the Generall Assembly did insert the book of Discipline in their Registers, &amp; did show how the act touching Bishops made at <hi>Dundee, Anno</hi> 1580. did condemne the estate of Bishops as they were then in Scotland. Unto this Assembly his Maj: Commissioner, <hi>William <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </hi> of <hi>Caprintoun</hi> presented the Confession of faith subscribed by the King &amp; his houshold, as also a plot of the presbiteries to be erected, mentioning their meeting places, &amp; appoynting the severall parishes, which should belong to such &amp; such presbiteries with a letter to the Noblemen &amp; Gentlemen of the countrey for their concurrence for the erection of presbiteries, &amp; dissolution of Prelacies, &amp; in his Maj: name he promised that his Maj: would set forward the policy, until it were established by Parliament, &amp; thus presbyteries began to be erected throughout the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>This was a sweet sun-shine, but it was followed with a very sad showre for when <hi>Amate Stuart</hi> of <hi>Aubignee,</hi> afterward <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lennox,</hi> obtaineth by the death of the Earle of <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toun,</hi> who was executed, &amp; the banishment of the Earle of <hi>Angus,</hi> the superiority of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> &amp; other things, to secure the same to him &amp; his posterity, he aggreeth with Mr. <hi>Robert Montgomery</hi> Minister at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> to accept of the bishoprick, &amp; to dispone to him all which belonged to that bishoprick, for the yearly payment of one thousand pound Scots, &amp; some horse-corne, &amp; poultry, which when the Church heareth, he is summoned before the Assembly at St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> &amp; commanded to leave the bishoprick, under the paine of Excommunication, &amp; the Presbitery of <hi>Sterlin</hi> is appointed to take notice of his cariage in doctrine &amp; discipline, for they had found him guilty in 14 or 15 points; but he went on, &amp; notwithstanding the presbitery had suspended him from the exercise of the Ministry, he procured an order unto the presbytery of Glasgow, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him as their Bishop, under the paine of banishment, &amp; with a company of armed souldiers entred the Church, &amp; pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Mr. David Weems</hi> out of the pulpit, &amp; being summoned to compear befor the Synod of <hi>Lothian,</hi> the King causeth

And shortely thereafter, when the Generall Assembly is examining his processe, the King sendeth a letter to them, discharging them to proceed any further, &amp; when they went on notwithstanding, they are charged by a Messenger of armes to desist under the paine of Rebellion, but they thinking it better to obey God, then man. ordained <hi>Mr. Montgomerie</hi> to compeer befor them the next day, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peered not, onely a Proctor in his name appealed unto the King. The Assembly did reject the appellation, &amp; proceed to examine the libell given in against him, &amp; finding him guilty of many hainous crimes, they ordaine him to be deposed &amp; excommunicated, but ere the sentence be pronounced, they appoint some of their number, to aquaint his Maj. with their whole procedure: And ere long <hi>Mr. Montgomery</hi> submitteth, passeth from his appellation, acknowledgeth his faults, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth repentance, with such solemne obtestations, as affected the whole Assembly. Upon this the sentence is delayed, &amp; the presbitery of <hi>Glasgow</hi> is appointed to advertise the provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Synod of <hi>Lothian</hi> (who were ordained to excommunicate him) in case he relapsed: And as they feared, so he returned to his vomit, &amp; with violence intended to enter the pulpit, &amp; when the presbitery, according to the appointment of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Assembly, were beginning a processe against him, the Laird of <hi>Minto</hi> provost of the Town, presented a warrant from his Maj. to stay the processe. &amp; when they were going on, he pulleth forth Mr. <hi>Iohn Howeson</hi> minister at <hi>Cambuslang</hi> Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator, &amp; imprisoned him in the Tolbooth. But for all this <hi>Mr. Montgomery</hi> is excommunicated by Mr. <hi>Iohn Davidson,</hi> &amp; the same was intimated in all the Churches.

But for all this when the acts of this Parliament were publishing, <hi>Mr Robert Pont</hi> protested, taking Instruments, that the Church should not be obliged to yeeld obedience thereunto, &amp; being denounced rebell he fleth into England.

That some Ministers should be added to him, without whose counsell he should do nothing. 3. His doctrine should be examined by the meeting. 4. His power should be of Order &amp; not of Jurisdiction. 5.

yet at length, seeing they could not have all which they desired, they accorde to this, that both Bishops, and Commissioners should be subject to the triall of the Generall Assembly, &amp; that, where they did reside, they should mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate provinciall Synods &amp; Presbyteries, &amp; in the meane time the order of the Presbyteries was sett down, &amp; they proceed to examine the processe of <hi>Mr Adamson,</hi> who had declined the provincial Synod of <hi>St Andrews,</hi> &amp; he submitteth.

               <p>When the Parliament doth conveen this year <hi>Anno</hi> 1587. there are some Prelats who would sit there in name of the Church: but when the Church perceived this, <hi>Mrs David Lindsay &amp; Robert Pont</hi> were sent to desire, that they might be removed as having no authority from the Church, &amp; the most of them no function in it at all.

And thus that Church was indeed as an army with banners, &amp; terrible to the adversaries of the truth. Then were there endevours to have a through worke of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation caried on; the iniquities of the land were searched out, corruptions in Ministers, &amp; other ranks of people were taken notice of, effectuall courses were laid down for preventing such abuses in time coming. Publick Fasts were indicted &amp; keeped whole eight dayes together. And thus [the Lord created upon every dwelling place of Mount Zion, &amp; upon her Assemblies, a cloud &amp; smoak by day, &amp; the shineing of a flaming fire by night, for upon all the glory was a defence], Isai. 4. 5.</p>

againe, &amp; to cause her meet with a dark, dreadfull, &amp; long lasting winter night. Satan stirreth up Papists upon the one hand, who saw that if this hedg, of discipline were keeped up, they could not enjoy the liberty &amp; peace they desired; &amp; prophane politicians &amp; Courteours upon the other hand, who saw that by this Discipline their licentiousnes would be curbed, to bestirre themselves against this established discipline: And accordingly they use their power with the King, &amp; at length prevaile to get him to oppose the discipline, &amp; to prosecute that designe piece &amp; piece till at length Prelats were establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all their power, as the following discourse will clearly evince.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Anno</hi> 1596. the Popish Lords who had conspired with <hi>Spaine</hi> against the countrey, and had been upon that acount ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished viz: <hi>Huntly Arrol</hi> &amp; <hi>Angus</hi> were called home, the Church saw Religion in danger, &amp; ordained that particular flocks should be advertised hereof, &amp; indicted a Fast, &amp; appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that some out of each Presbitery should concurre with the Presbitery of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> in considering of the most expedient way for securing, of Religion: and now because the Church would not consent unto the Kings calling home those popish Lords, he is stirred up by his popish Courteours against the Church, &amp; incroacheth dayly more &amp; more upon her liberties. For <hi>Mr D. Black</hi> minister at <hi>St Andr.</hi> is cited before the Councill for some alledged expressions in his sermon. The ministry, seeing that the spirituall Governement of the house of God was intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be quite subverted, thought it best that he give in a Declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour &amp; there in shew <q>[that though he was able to defend all that he spoke; yet seing his answering to that accusation before them might import a prejudice to the liberties of the Church, &amp; be taken for an acknowledgement of his Maj: jurisdiction in maters meerly spirituall; he was constrained to decline that Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatorie. 1. because the Lord Jesus had given to him his word for a Rule, &amp; so he could not fall under any civill law, but in so farr as he should be found, after triall, to have passed from his Instructions, which triall belongeth onely to the prophets. 2.

This displeased the King so, that he by open pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation commanded the Commissioners of the Church to depart out of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> within twenty fowr houres, under the paine of rebellion: but notwithstanding of this, they resolve to stay, &amp; to see that the Church priviledges should not be wronged, &amp; send some of their number to speake to his M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the King charged the Commissioners of new to depart, &amp; caused cite <hi>Mr. Black</hi> unto the <hi>last</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> &amp; withall dischargeth all Barons, Gentlemen &amp; others to meet with mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters in their Church assemblies; without his licence. When the day of <hi>Mr Blacks</hi> compearance cometh, the Commission<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers presente a supplication, desiring them to remitt the question unto the Judge competent, but the Councill goeth on, &amp; therefore they protest that the processe in hand, &amp; whatsoever fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed thereupon should not prejudge the liberty of the Church, in maters of Doctrine. Afterward the King sendeth unto the Commissioners, shewing he would be content with Mr. <hi>Blacks</hi> simple declaration of the truth. But worthy Mr. <hi>Bruce</hi> answered <q>[That if the mater did touch <hi>Mr Black</hi> alone, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: but the liberty of Christs Kingdome had received such a wound by the Proclamations published the last Satter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,

&amp; that day by the usurpation of the Council; that if <hi>Mr Blacks</hi> life, &amp; the life of twenty others had been taken, it had not grieved the hearts of the godly so much—&amp; that either these things behoved to be retreated, or they would oppose so long as they had breath.]</q> Then the King condiscended to publish by a Declaration, that he would not diminish any lawfull power or liberty, which they or their As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies had, either by the Word of God, or lawes of the land, &amp; that the proclamation discharging Barons &amp; others to meet with ministers was onely meaned, of their meeting in armes, &amp; that the Interloqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But afternoon the Kings minde was found changed, &amp; because <hi>Mr Black</hi> would not acknowledge an offence, he is condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Council, &amp; his punishment is remitted to the King, &amp; till his pleasure were known, he is confined. Then there is a bond devised to be subscribed by all the ministers, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the paine of the lose of their stipends. The tenor wherof followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Wee the Pastors, &amp; ministers of Gods word undersub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing humbly acknowledging our duty to God, &amp; obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the King our Souveraigne Lord, whom for conscience cause, we ought to obey; Confesse that his Grace is soveraigne Judge to us, &amp; each one of us in all causes of sedition, &amp; trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, &amp; other criminal &amp; civill maters, &amp; to all our speach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, which may import the saids crimes. albeit uttered by any of us publickly in the pulpits (which God forbid) or in any other place, &amp; that the said pulpits, nor any other place whatsoever, hath not that priviledge &amp; immunity to be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion or pretence to any of us, of declining of his Maj? judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in any of the saids civill or criminall causes, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded against us, in any time coming: but rather that our of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence is the greater, incase (which God forbid) any of us commit such crimes, in the saids pulpits, before the people where the word of Gods truth &amp; salvation should be preached
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65203:31"/>
by us to our flocks. In witness wherof, &amp; of the humble acknowledgement of our duty in the premisses, we have subscribed these presents with our hands, &amp; are content that the famine be registrat in the books of secret Councell <hi>in futuram rei memoriam.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But faithfull ministers refused upon all hazards to subscribe the same, seeing that it was a crossing of their Declinatour, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the acts of the Generall Assembly, &amp; to the acts of Parliament, made in favours of the Church; yea &amp; to the word of God, because by this bond they should have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the King to be both supreme &amp; onely Judge over mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters in all causes, &amp; so to have power of Judging; &amp; deposing them, yea &amp; of judging &amp; trying their preaching, if it be but co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured with treason &amp; sedition; &amp; of schisme in the Church which is sedition: and seeing thereby they should be bound up from faithfull dealing in the name of the Lord; &amp; because they saw it was devysed of purpose as a snare to their consciences.</p>
               <p>After this <hi>Anno</hi> 1596. the king driveth on his designe, &amp; indicteth an Assembly at <hi>perth,</hi> &amp; formeth 55 problemes, by which the Discipline of the Church, formerly established, was questioned, to be there debatéd (these problems with the following Historie at more length are to be seen in the Historie penned by Reverend &amp; laborious Mr <hi>Petry,</hi> &amp; therefore a short relation shall suffice here) &amp; being perswaded by his Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiours, that he should never gaine his purpose, till first he took some course to breake the Union of the Church, he prevaileth with <hi>Mr Patrik Galloway</hi> &amp; <hi>Mr Iames Nicolson,</hi> who had been chief, a little before, in advising <hi>Mr Black</hi> to decline, &amp; causeth <hi>Sr Patrick Murray</hi> deal with the ministers of the North to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe the bond, &amp; to choose such &amp; such persons to the meeting at <hi>Perth:</hi> and when the time of meeting cometh, these Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners from the North were seen going in companies to the king, &amp; Mr <hi>Nicolson</hi> was with the king till mid-night. They were for all this; two dayes in debating whether they were a lawfull Generall Assembly; but honest men protested against it. The meeting at length condiscendeth to these particulars. 1. That no minister should reprove his maiesties
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65203:31"/>
lawes, acts, or ordinances, untill such time, as first he had, by advyce of Presbitery, Synod, or Assembly, complained or sought remedy of the same. 2. That none should be named in pulpit, except the fault were notour by the persons being fugitive, convicted by ane Assise, Excommunicated, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacious after citation or lawfull admonition: and none should be vively described, except by publick vices alwayes damnable, 3. That there should be no summary Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, untill the next Generall assembly. 4. That there should be no meetings among ministers, except in Church judicatories: and afterward they appoint fourteen of their number to reason upon the rest of the questions.</p>
               <p>The next year <hi>Anno</hi> 1597. there is another Assembly at <hi>Dundee</hi> which being corrupted, doth grant 1. That Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters in their exercises at Presbyteries should make no applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of doctrine. 2. That Presbyteries should meddle with nothing, but what, without all question, is Ecclesiasticall. 3. That summare Excommunication be suspended, &amp; 4. That Presbyteries should desist upon his Majesties desire. Also at the kings desire they choose fourteen of their number, giving power to them, or any seven of them to advise with his Maj. about a way of setling stipends unto ministers, to provide mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters to eminent places of the Countrey, to present petitions &amp; grievances of the Church to his Maj. &amp; to give his Maj. ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in maters serving for the good of the Church. These pretexts seemed plausible to many, but the event will shew what was really intended: For ere long these Commissioners, as they were called, incroach upon the power of Presbyteries, &amp; Synods, &amp; whether the Presbytery of <hi>Saint Andrews</hi> would or not, did put both Mr <hi>Wallace &amp;</hi> Mr <hi>Black</hi> from the Church of <hi>Saint Andrews,</hi> &amp; put in one Mr <hi>George Gladstons,</hi> &amp; then at their own hand, they did supplicat the Parliament, which conveened in December. That ministers, as representing the Church, the third Estate of the Kingdome, might have liberty to vote in Parliament (an evill, under which the Church had been groaning, before, of a long time) The parllament, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (but without ground) that the ministers would never
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65203:32"/>
take upon them the titles of the former Prelats, passed this Act.</p>
               <p>That such ministers as his Maj: should be pleased to provide to the place, title, and dignity of a Bishop, Abbot, or other prelate, should have that liberty: and as concerning their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in the spirituall policy of the Church, it was remitted to be advised by his Maj: &amp; aggreed upon with the Generall Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; &amp; that without prejudice of the spirituall Jurisdiction &amp; Discipline of the Church, permitted to Generall Assemblies, Synods, Presbiteries, &amp; Sessions, &amp; established by <hi>Law.</hi> Then they move the King to call an Assembly at <hi>Dundee</hi> before the time appoynted, to the end they might get their own deed approven; where, after much worke, &amp; after many threatenings to some, &amp; promises to others, made by the King himself who was there present, &amp; had commanded <hi>Mr Melvin</hi> &amp; <hi>Mr Iohnston</hi> Professours of Theology in <hi>St. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drewes</hi> forth of the town, under the paine of banishment, their deed is approven. But zealous &amp; faithfull <hi>Mr Davidson</hi> arose &amp; protested in his own name, &amp; in name of all the ministers of Scotland who would adhere to his protestation, against that Assembly, &amp; the two last preceeding Assemblies, as null, &amp; not lawfull, &amp; when he removed severall of the ministers fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him, &amp; subscribed the same. The meeting went on, &amp; renewed the former Commission unto twenty Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, whereof nine should be a quorum, among whom was <hi>Mrs Iames Nicolson, George Gladstones, David Lindsay, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander Lindsay, Andro Knox, Gavin Hamilton,</hi> &amp; <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Douglas,</hi> (whom the king by any means would have named) who were all bishops afterward. Thereafter there were severall meetings, as one at <hi>Falkland Iuly</hi> 29. 1598. where were some debates about this mater. &amp; some cautions condiscended on, limiting these Parliamentary Ministers, To propone nothing without expresse warrant from the Church. To be accomptable to the Generall Assembly, &amp; subject to their Presbitery &amp; Synod. To usurp no power of Jurisdiction or Ordination, but every way else to cary themselves as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ministers, &amp; the like; &amp; to all these, &amp; other points necessary they were bound to swear &amp; subscribe. But how litle
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65203:32"/>
regard was had to these Cautions, sworne, &amp; subscribed, may be seen by what <hi>Spotiswood</hi> sayeth in his History pag. 453. viz <hi>[That it was neither the Kings intention, nor the mindes of the wiser sort, to have these Cautions stand in force, but to have matters peaceably ended, &amp; the Reformation of the policy made without any noise, they gave way to these conceits]</hi> So was there another Meeting at Halyrood house in November 1599. but in all these meetings the honest party could prevail nothing, the king did so violently cary on his purpose.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1600. There is a Generall Assembly at Montrose, where the matter is againe debated, but no answer made to the arguments of the honest party, onely the Kings authority is made use of, as an answer to all: And so at length, what by menaces, what by flatterings made by the king himself, who was there present, the former resolutions are concluded, onely they allow of the Cautions condiscended on at <hi>Falckland,</hi> &amp; will have these Parliamentary Ministers to give an accompt yearly unto the Generall Assembly, &amp; lay down their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission. But these Commissioners, or Parliamentary mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, being mounted up so high, thought it below them to stand to any promise, or condition, having never resolved so to do, as we have heard out of <hi>Spotiswood,</hi> who in his latine pamphlet called <hi>Refutatio libelli,</hi> &amp;c. sayeth also the same <hi>[Conditiones quod attinet, quas foede violatas clamitat, in non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nullas, utpote aequas &amp; jujlas facile assensum, aliae pro tempore magis, quo contentiosis, omnis rixands ansa praeriperetur, quam animo in perpetuum observandi, acceptae.]</hi> that there were some of these Cautions which they never intended to keep, onely they did accept of them, that more peaceably they might be put in poss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1601, &amp; 1602. The Assemblies follow forth his Maj. designe, for there was a complaint given in by the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod of <hi>

1604. but the Parliamentary ministers, fearing that they should be called to an account, move the king to prorogue the same, unto July 2, <hi>An.</hi> 1605. yet the Commissioners from <hi>St Andrews</hi> presbitery viz <hi>Mrs Iames Melvin, William Erskin, &amp; William Murray</hi> went to <hi>Aberdeen</hi> the day appoynted, &amp; presented their Commissions, taking Instruments in the hands of two publick Notars, before some ministers of the towne, &amp; others. When the next dyet, <hi>Anno</hi> 1605. was approaching, they move the King to prorogue againe the Assembly unto an indefinit time, &amp; therefore from <hi>London</hi> he sendeth to the Commissioners to stay the meeting of the Assembly, untill he gave advertisement, wherupon they write to severall Presbiteries in the South pairts, adviseing them not to choose Commissioners to meet at <hi>Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deen</hi> the fifth day of July, (of purpose to deceive them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the day, which was the second, &amp; not the fifth: that so, such as would meet the second day, being so few, might easily be moved to dissolve, before the rest came, who would intend onely to keep the fifth day) But the honest party, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving how their liberties were now in danger, did resolve to meet at <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> &amp; accordingly there cometh from parts neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by some against the second of July, unto whom <hi>Lawreston</hi> his Maj. Commissioner presented a letter from the Councell, &amp; desired an answer. They replyed, that they behooved first to constitute themselves, &amp; after he had withdrawn, they choosed a moderator &amp; Clerk, &amp; then read the letter, wherein there were two things desired, first that they would dissolve the meeting, &amp; next that they would appoint no other day, untill his Maj. were advertised. As to the first they answered that they were ready to dissolve the meeting, there being so few present. To the next they answered that if <hi>Lawreston</hi> as his Maj.

When <hi>Lawreston</hi> seeth this, he protesteth against them as no lawfull Generall Assembly, &amp; giveth his reasons, which were answered, &amp; they protest to the contrary, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon

Whereupon in <hi>Septr. Mr Welsh &amp; Mr Forbes</hi> were imprisoned by the Councill in <hi>Blackenesse,</hi> &amp; in <hi>Octr.</hi> others were incarcerat.

Unto this Parliament the Commissioners from Synods &amp; presbiteries gave in a protestation, <q>desiring them to keep within their due bounds, &amp; reserve unto the Lord that glory, which he will communicate neither to man nor angel viz: to prescribe from his holy mountaine a lively patterne, according to which his own tabernacle should be framed, &amp; that they would not bring into the kirke of God, the Ordinance of man, which hath been found the ground of much evill, &amp; of that Antichristian Hierarchie. That they would not build <hi>Iericho</hi> againe, contrare to their oath &amp; subscription, nor suffer that Estate of Bishops to arise, which they offered to prove
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:65203:34"/>
to be against the word of God, the ancient Fathers, &amp; Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of the Church, the moderne most learned, &amp; godly Divines, the Doctrine &amp; Constitution of the Church of Scotland, the lawes of the Realme, the well &amp; honour of the kings Maj. the peace &amp; quyetness of the realme &amp; the well of all &amp; every one of the subjects, and then. In the name of the Church in generall, &amp; of their presbyteries, &amp; in their own name &amp; of all other pastors, for discharging of their duety &amp; consciences, they did protest against bishopry &amp; bishops, &amp; against the Erection, Confirmation, or Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication thereof, requireing the famine to be Registrated.</q> This protestation was subscribed by many ministers, &amp; among others by <hi>Mr Adam Banatine, Mr Iohn Abernethy, &amp; Mr VVilliam Couper,</hi> who afterward became bishops them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
               <p>When prelats are thus advanced to their civill dignities, there are wayes essayed for advancing them in their spirituall power: and this same year there is an assembly indicted at <hi>Lithgow</hi> the 10 of <hi>December;</hi> but onely some presbyteries, in whom the king confided most, were advertised hereof, &amp; the businesse was carried so closely that the moderator of the last as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly knew nothing of it. Here, after some debate, the overture propounded by his Maj. in his letter, viz: that there should be constant moderators in presbyteries chosen, &amp; that where the bishops did reside, they should moderate, both in Synods &amp; presbyteries, is concluded, &amp; some cautions added, but to no purpose for there was a clause annexed, which did cast all loose, viz <hi>that if, either upon his Maj. advyce &amp; proposition to the assembly, or upon their own supplication, the Generall assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly were moved to grant a relaxation of any of the Caveats, that then their promise should make no derogation to their liberty.</hi> Synods &amp; presbyteries refused to owne this Act, but at length were charged to obey under the paine of treason.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1608. There was another Assembly at <hi>Lithgow</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 26. but did no good, thereafter there were some conferenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es at <hi>Falkland &amp; Sterlin,</hi> but to no purpose, the intended businesse was still carried on.</p>

                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1610. Juny 6. There is a meeting at <hi>Glasgow,</hi> unto which resorteth all the constant Maderators, who had their hundreth pounds per annum, and they bring with them other two ministers, such as they liked, &amp; whom the king desired by his letters. The king had three Commissioners there. The Earle of <hi>Dumber</hi> was sent thither with a strong guard to affright the ministers, so as severall ministers; coming out of the west with a purpose to protest were forced to returne back againe. There was also money brought thither to hire votes. <hi>Mr Spotiswood</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it was to pay the constant Moderators their due. But <hi>Mr Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in Coberspath</hi> was no moderator, &amp; yet he came to the Earle &amp; complained that <hi>though he travailed furdest, and had least to live upon, &amp; though his vote was as good as the best; yet he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected,</hi> to whom the Earle replyed, that he was too late in coming, &amp; asking his purse-master <hi>what was left,</hi> he findeth there was nothing but seventeen Shillings Sterlin to give him: <hi>Come</hi> (sayeth <hi>Mr Lawder) let me have it, it will help to bear my charges homeward:</hi> And the <hi>Non-liquets</hi> got nothing. At this corrupt meeting it is concluded 1. That the indiction of all Generall Assemblies belonged to the king, by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of his Crowne, &amp; without his license all such meetings were unlawfull. 2. That Synods should be moderated by the Prelats, or some appointed by them. 3. No excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation or absolution without the Bishops approbation, &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, who is answerable to God &amp; to his Maj. for his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings 4. All presentations must be directed to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats. 5. That he with some associated, should silence &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose ministers 6 That every minister, at his entry, should swear obedience to his Maj. &amp; to his ordinary as it was ordained An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no 1571. 7. If any minister absente himself from the Bishops visitation, he shall be suspended, &amp; if he amend not, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed. 8. That the exercises (or <hi>quondam</hi> presbyteries) should be moderated by the bishops, or whom they will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point. And 9. That no minister speak against any of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said acts in publick, nor dispute about the equality or inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of ministers.</p>
               <p>This yeer also was the <hi>High Commission</hi> instituted, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamed
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:65203:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by a Herald giving power to the Archbishops to depose, excommunicat, imprison, fine &amp; confine, for causes Ecclesias<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, whether in Doctrine, or manners, whether in Noblemen, ministers, or common people.</p>
               <p>When the meeting at <hi>Glasgow</hi> is dissolved, Mr <hi>Spotiswood</hi> of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> Mr <hi>Lamb</hi> of <hi>Brichen,</hi> &amp; Mr <hi>Hamilton</hi> of <hi>Galloway,</hi> go to London &amp; there are consecrated the 21 of <hi>Octob.</hi> &amp; when they returne, they consecrate the rest, &amp; then all of them do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineer over the people, &amp; over the faithfull ministers.</p>
               <p>Anno 1612. a Parliament conveened, which ratified all the acts of that meeting at <hi>Glasgow,</hi> &amp; inserted in their Regis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the oath which every minister, at his admission was to swear thus, <q>I A, B. admitted to the Kirk of <hi>D.</hi> testify &amp; declare in my conscience, that the right excellent, right High, &amp; mighty Prince, <hi>Iames</hi> the sixth, by the grace of God King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> &amp;c. is the onely lawfull supreme Governour of this Realme, as well in matters Spiritual &amp; Ecclesiastick, as in things temporall, &amp; that no forraigne Prince, State, nor Potentate, hath or ought to have any Jurisdiction, Power Superiority, Preheminence, or authority, Ecclesiasticall, or Spirituall within Realme. And therefore I utterly renunce &amp; forsake all forraigne Jurisdiction, Power, Superiorities, &amp; authorities, &amp; promise that from this forth, I shall &amp; will bear faith &amp; true allaidgeance to his Highnesse, his aires, &amp; lawfull successours: And to my power shall assist &amp; defend all Jurisdictions, Privileges, Preheminences, &amp; authority, granted &amp; belonging to his Highnesse his aires &amp; lawfull suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours, or united &amp; annexed to his Royall Crown.

               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1616. There was a meeting of the ministers at <hi>Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deen,</hi> appointing that a book of Common Prayer be made, &amp; that children should be confirmed by the bishops or visitors in their name.</p>
               <p>But the year before this, the former commission, for the High commission was renewed, &amp; instead of the two Courts in the two Provinces of <hi>Saint Andrews</hi> &amp; <hi>Glasgow,</hi> there is one ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, consisting of 55 or 56. one of the Archbishops is <hi>sine quo non,</hi> &amp; he &amp; other five may do all; Such as refuse to compeer are sisted by force, by the Sherifs, &amp; other magis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trats. They meddle with blasphemie, heresy, schisme, er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, Idolatry, simony, lotry, absence from the Liturgy on holy Dayes, perjury, incest, adultery, fornication, rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, clandestine marriages, stricking of clergy men, speaking against their meetings. They have power to excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat, silence, depose, sine, imprison, &amp; confine as long as they please, &amp; the Secret Councell must pursue the contuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious as rebells.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1617. A Parliament conveeneth, at which the King himself is present, &amp; maketh an act <hi>[That whatsoever his Maj. should determine in the externall governement of the Church with the advyce of the archbishops, Bishops, &amp; a competent number of the ministry, should have the strength of a law]</hi> when the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest ministry hear of this, &amp; see thereby a door opened for bringing in all the English-popish Ceremonies, they give in a Protestation against the same, which when the king heareth he causeth the Clerk passe by that act, when he was to read all the rest. And now the king is violent for the Ceremonies, &amp; chideth the Archbishops for not receiving the five articles, as he commanded the former year: and they promise to do it, if he would indict a Generall assembly. And upon Mr <hi>Galleway's</hi> undertaking the king indicteth a meeting at St <hi>Andrews</hi> Nov. 25. 1617. At this assembly no more could be gotten yeelded to, but private Communion, &amp; that ministers should give the Elements in the Lords supper out of their own hands to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:65203:36"/>
each Communicant. But all this did not satisfy his Maj. &amp; therefore he wrote sharpe letters, to the Archbishops &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to preach on Christ-masse day, &amp; to celebrat the Lord's supper with all the solemnities.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1618 there is another meeting called at <hi>Perth August.</hi> 25 unto which the king sent seven Noblemen, &amp; fifteen Barons, &amp; Gentlemen, <hi>Spotiswood</hi> took upon him to moderate, &amp; read the kings minacing letter, &amp; named a Committee for the articls, nothing regarding the liberty of the assembly, to gratify the king. The honest party offered reasons both for a delay, &amp; against the Ceremonies, but all in vaine: <hi>Spotis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> told them that he would send all the names of such as refused, unto the King, &amp; asked the votes of many who had no Commission, &amp; so obtained what the desired, for all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded unto the five articles viz: <hi>kneeling at the Communion, private Communion, private Baptisme, observation of Holy dayes, &amp; Confirmation of children,</hi> except one Nobleman, one Doctor. 45. ministers. But when the honest party looked back to the many informalities at this meeting. 1. No law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full premunition, but onely 20 dayes, by which meanes many were absent. 2. No liberty to choose a moderator. 3. No free disputing or voteing, but members overawed, 4. The assembly prelimited by the votes of the articles. 5. Such as wanted Commissions did vote, &amp; others who had Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, were not suffered to vote &amp;c. they looked upon it as no lawfull Generall assembly, &amp; published their reasons in print.</p>
               <p>After the dissolving of this meeting; <hi>Spotiswood,</hi> to make all sure; ratifieth all these things in the High Commission, &amp; though he &amp; others had said, that if they would give way to the passing of the act to humore his Maj. no man should be compelled to obey, yet now by the power of their High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, they force many to obey, under the paine of deposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, imprisonement, &amp; confinement, &amp; so they rage with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all law.</p>
               <p>But at length <hi>Anno 1621. there is a parliament conveened, unto which the Honest ministers give in a supplication for safe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to enjoy the true Religion, as Reformed in Doctrine, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oraments,</hi>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:65203:37"/>
                  <hi>&amp; discipline, &amp; openly professed, sworn, &amp; prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised, by Prince, Pastor, &amp; people of all ranks, without In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations: and that they would not suffer the faithfull honest mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters to be smitten, &amp; the stocks to be committed to wolves: &amp; blinde guides. But Iuly</hi> 24. they were all discharged forth of the towne by open proclamation: The presenter of the petition <hi>Mr Andrew Duncane</hi> minister ar <hi>Crail</hi> was incarcerated. When the ministers remove conforme to the proclamation, they leave in write behinde them strong reasons why the Parliament should not ratify the acts of the pretented assembly at <hi>Perth,</hi> &amp; shew both the nullity of the assembly in point of formality, &amp; the illegality of any such Ratification, as being against se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall acts of Parliament, his Maj. proclamation published &amp; printed, &amp; the Nationall Covenant, &amp; upon severall other grounds. As also they leave a most Christian &amp; faithfull ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition to the well affected Nobility, Barons, &amp; burgeses members of Parliament, unto constancy &amp; faithfulnesse. Yea moreover in case all this should not prevaile, they leave a Protestation in write: but the minister who had it to present gote not accesse, &amp; so was forced to affix Copies thereof upon publick places of the towne.</p>
               <p>But notwithstanding of all this, there is a fixed resolution to have these articles ratified, which made some honest members with draw: severall informalities are used, contrary to the usuall freedome of Parliament, much pains taken to gaine some, &amp; after the report was made to go, that the Parliament would not rise for severall dayes to come, which made severall members the more secure; <hi>Saterday</hi> the 4 of <hi>August.</hi> was pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon, as the fittest time, for closeing of the business, &amp; all the articles are put together, &amp; the question stated <hi>Aggree</hi> or <hi>Disaggree,</hi> &amp; what by one way &amp; another the acts are rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. But observable it was how the Lord did give his Protes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation against this ratification from heaven (though <hi>Spotis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> blasphemously paralleleth it unto the Lords shewing of himself at the giving of the Law) for at the very instant when the kings Commissioner arose to touch this act with the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, there came in at the windowes a great lightening, &amp; after
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:65203:37"/>
that another greater, &amp; then a third most terrible: Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly there followed an extraordinary darknesse astonishing all. The lightenings were seconded with three terrible claps of thunder, &amp; then their came an extradinary great showre of haile, &amp; after all this such a terrible showre of raine, that made the streets to run like rivers, by which meanes the parliament was constrained to stay within doores, an howr &amp; an half, &amp; went home thereafter without their robes.</p>
               <p>Upon the 20 of August, when these acts were published at the Crosse, the minister, who was intrusted with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation, affixed a copy thereof upon the Church door, &amp; another upon the Crosse, &amp; a third upon the Palace gate of Haliroodhouse, &amp; took Instruments in these words <hi>[Here in the name of the brethren of the ministry, professing the Religion, as it hath been practised in our Church, since the Reformation of the same, I protest against all these things, that have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, in prejudice of our privileges, since the first Reformation thereof, &amp; adhere to my former Protestation made &amp; fixed on the Tolbooth door, &amp; other places, &amp; to all the Protestations made in favours of the Church, in the time of the preceeding Parliaments]</hi> And God from heaven did declare his dissent, for dureing the time of the reading of these acts there was nothing but thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, fire, lightenings, &amp; raine. And thereafter the Lord made the whole countrey feel the weight of his anger, for the cornes did rott through excessive raines: waters became so great that they sweeped away in severall places cornes, cattell, houses, plenishing, people &amp; all. The great bridge of <hi>Perth</hi> where these acts were first concluded was taken away, &amp; never repaired to this day, yea &amp; the whole towne almost drowned, many of the Sea-townes which favoured the Articles, received great dammage by Sea. And there followed three years dearth &amp; famine, &amp; Epidemick diseases, wherof many died. Thus did the Lord plead from heaven his controversy, &amp; testify his displeasure against those courses.</p>
               <p>But notwithstanding of all this, the Prelats, having now all power in their hands, prosecute their worke, &amp; tyrannize over all ranks, so as the inhabitants were more affrayed of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:65203:38"/>
crossing their commands, then the commands of the king him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, for they banished out of their bounds such gentlemen as they pleased, imprisoned what magistrates they thought fit, upon any light occasion, were it but the hearing of their own old minister, after he had been silenced by the bishop, or the not sisting of one, though their own father, before their ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannicall Court.</p>
               <p>Now is there a black cloud over the Church for many years, piety is dayly decaying, formality, &amp; profanity increasing, the godly are mourning &amp; lamenting, &amp; the wicked rejoyceing. But the Prelats have not yet ended their purpose.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Anno</hi> 1633. when King <hi>Charles</hi> was present at a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there is an Act carried through (but not without some opposition made thereunto by some of the Nobles) granting power to his Maj. to command what habits he pleaseth for all men in office, whether in Church or State, &amp; that as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge annexed to the Crowne, &amp; by this means a door was opened to bring in the <hi>Surplice,</hi> the <hi>Corner cap,</hi> &amp; other trash. These worthies being traduced by the Prelats, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temners of authority, &amp; sowers of sedition in Church &amp; State, procure the kings displeasure by their freedome; For the king did not onely chide them openly, but with his own hand he wrote down their names, as disloyall subjects; which made these Nobles thinke of drawing up a supplication, which being drawn up by <hi>William Haig</hi> his Maj. solicitour, was committed to the trust of the <hi>Earle of Rothes</hi> &amp; <hi>Lord Loudoun</hi> to present it as they found conveniency, but they perceiving that it would not be well accepted resolved to keep it up: But at length some way or other a copy thereof cometh to the Bishops hands, &amp; they deliver it unto the king, &amp; withall complaine of those Noble-men, as standing in the way of his subjects yeelding chearfull obedience: And upon their importunat requeests, there is a Commission granted to certaine persons, as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee to proceed against the Authors &amp; abettors of that suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, as guilty of sedition &amp; treason. Whereupon <hi>William Haig</hi> fleeth, &amp; all his goods are confiscat. Some Noblemen
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:65203:38"/>
are questioned, &amp; the Lord <hi>Balmerino</hi> who had the supplication in his custody, is imprisoned &amp; at length condemned to die, but obtaineth pardon.</p>
               <p>Now the prelats do reigne, there being none who durst peep, or move a wing against them. The Achprelate of <hi>Saint Andrews</hi> was Chancellour, other eight of the prelats were in great places, being either Lords of the privy Councell, or Lords of the Exchequer: &amp; being thus lifted up in power &amp; honour, they are puffed up with pride, &amp; what durst they not attempt now (thinke they) Therefore they proceed to do more wickedness, &amp; draw up a book of Canons, which was printed, &amp; approven by the Kings Maj. &amp; all were commanded to obey the Bishops in all points. By this book that which remained of presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian governement is taken away. Parochiall Sessions, &amp; Classicall Presbyteries are accounted Conventicles; Ruleing Elders &amp; Deacons are cast out of the Church, &amp; all Ecclesias<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall causes are brought only to the Pelats tribunall. So were they about the drawing up of a Liturgy, &amp; a Book of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, against which, before ever they were printed, or seen, all were discharged to speak under the pain of Excommunication. And at length, the book of Common Prayer is published &amp; imposed on the Church by the kings command, as the onely forme of publick divine worship. Every Parish is command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have two at least of these books, under the paine of horn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp; being punished as rebells: And a strict command cometh forth, enjoyning the same to be used from <hi>Pasch</hi> &amp; forward <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> 1637. But some of the Prelats as of <hi>Rose &amp; Dumblaine,</hi> did anticipate the day, &amp; made use of it in their Cathedralls, Others of the Prelats propone the matter to their Synods: but the Ministers replyed that such a change should not be made without a Nationall Assembly; but it was answered that they were the Representatives of the Church: However some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats gave Ministers liberty to advise untill. <hi>Octob.</hi> but through the furious importunity of some a letter is procured from his Maj. commanding the useing of the Liturgy with all expedition in the Churches of <hi>Edinburgh:</hi> The Ministers being called
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:65203:39"/>
to see what they would do, such as refused are presently sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended.</p>

                  <p>The way how the Lord brought down these Prelats &amp; the History continued.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT was sad &amp; lamentable to see what a face the Church of Scotland had now: No hedge of Discipline to keep the vineyaird from foxes, &amp; wilde boars, all the Discipline which was, was tyrannie over consciences, &amp; over mens persons, &amp; estates, profanitie was not curbed, but encouraged, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats themselves being chief in all those crying abhominations, as will be cleared ere long: yea that poor Church was now posteing fast to Rome. The Prelats &amp; their underlings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side the points of Arminianisme (which were accounted speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all pieces of their qualification) did avow openly severall points of Popery; so that it was taught publickly in the chief Citie. That <hi>the Pope was not Antichrist.</hi> And thus all things were growing worse; the worship corrupted &amp; like to be corrupted more, &amp; the mindes of people were filled with feares, that God would depairt, &amp; leave that Church altogether; so thattheir case looked most deplorable, &amp; desperat like. But asoftentimes the Church &amp; people of God have found him, who was the hope ofIsrael, &amp; the Saviour thereof in times of trouble, a ready help in time of need, so did the poor Church of Scotland finde it now by experience, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the storme was sorest, it was neerest an end, &amp; that this was as the darke houre before the dawning of the day: for now the Lord awaketh as one after wine, &amp; looketh through the cloud with Compassion on a long tossed, &amp; sorely afflicted Church, which had groaned under oppression of cruell task-masters, till they could do no more, &amp; sheweth that

               <p>In obedience to his Maj. last letter, which commanded the reading of the liturgie in all haste, the Bishop of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> the first sabbath day thereafter resolved to do it, &amp; when he beginneth, there ariseth a tumult among the people, begun by some women, which encreased so as that the prelate, when he came out of the Church, did hardly escape, &amp; in the rest of the Churches of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> the reading was stopped: Immediatly after dinner the <hi>Secret Counsell</hi> did meet, &amp; resolve to search out the authors of this tumult, &amp; commanded the use of the service book, &amp; all to speake reverently of the Bishops; but, notwithstanding of this, the people rage more then ever, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Prelats, &amp; after the afternoons sermon they set upon the Prelate with stones, &amp; forced him to flee.</p>
               <p>About this time, in other pairts of the Kingdome the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters &amp; honest people, who were urged, &amp; could not give obedience, resolved to follow a more regular way, and to supplicat the Councell, &amp; to give in a note of the errours con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in these books, which accordingly they did: so from severall pairts of the Kingdome, there came Ministers &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessours with supplications, sheweing how erro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

how the King foure years before, at his Coronation, did so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemly swear that he would alter nothing in the Kingdome of Scotland, without the free consent &amp; advice of those having Interest. Unto these Supplications the Councill at first gave a favourable answere, &amp; told that it was not their minde; to presse the publick use of these books, &amp; that they had forbidden the Bishops to presse the use of these books any more, &amp; that they had signified their minde to his Maj, &amp; were expecting a returne. The petitioners likewise sent their supplications to his Maj. with the Duke of <hi>Lennox,</hi> who was then returning to <hi>London,</hi> &amp; withall did wreastle with God by prayer &amp; fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But when the expresse cometh from his Maj. all the answere they get, is, an Edict published <hi>Octobr</hi> 18. commanding them to go out of the towne of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> within few hours, under the paine of Rebellion. When the Petitioners see this, the next day, they resolve to act all together joyntly, that his Maj. might know it was not a few Puritanes (as the impure Prelats were pleased to nickname them) but a great mulitude of his Maj. most loyall subjects of all ranks, who were dissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied: And they draw up a complaint against the prelats, &amp; desire liberty of the Councell to pursue them legally, as being the onely authors of the Book of Canons, &amp; liturgy, which containe the seeds of Superstition &amp; Idolatry, &amp; as being guilty of many other crimes, &amp; that under the highest perrill: And withall they shew the Councell that they could not leave the towne, untill they saw some course taken for delivering the land from the present &amp; imminent dangers. When the Councell saw that the number of the Petitioners was great, &amp; dayly increas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, fearing the worst, they desired the petitoners would choose some of their number as their Commissioners, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute their business, that the multitude might depairt, &amp; this was yeelded unto. But ere long the Councell is discharged by an Expresse from his Maj. to meddle any more in that matter: Whereupon the Supplicants are necessitated to draw up
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:65203:40"/>
a Protestation, declaring that if any tumult arose, through their prosecution of the Cause, the Councell onely might be blam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as refusing justice. When the Counsell heareth of this, they resolve to hear the desire of the Commissioners, &amp; advise the Bishops to withdraw themselves. When the Commission<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers compeer, they show their Intention was to prosecute their business against the Prelats, whom they would prove guilty of grievous crimes, under the highest perrill, &amp; therefore desired the prelats might be excluded, it not being fit that parties should be judges, The Councell, because of the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Expresse, might do nothing: Onely they write to his Maj. who thereafter sendeth for the Earle of <hi>Traquair;</hi> but he, for fear of the Prelats did misrepresent the Cause of the Supplicants, &amp; returned with a Proclamation from his Maj. which he caused publish at <hi>Sterlin</hi> (where the Councell was sitting) in <hi>Febr.</hi> 1638, In which Proclamation the King owned the books which the petitioners did supplicat against, and condemned the meetings of the Supplicants, as conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies contrary to the lawes of the Land: Against this the petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners prepared a Protestation, a copy wherof was affixed at the Crosse of Sterlin, &amp; herein protested against these Books, as full of errours, as Innovations; against their refusing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive libells against the Prelats; against the High Commission Court obtruded on Scotland contrary to the fundamentall law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the land, without any Municipall law: That prelate should not be judges in their own cause: And that all their own meetings were lawfull: And that they could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear with a good conscience, unlesse they should wrong the Glory of God, the honour of his Maj. &amp; the liberties of kirk &amp; Kingdome. And because they were commanded to depart forth of the town of <hi>Sterlin,</hi> they go together towards <hi>Edenburg,</hi> &amp; there after serious thoughts they finde the maine procureing cause of all these calamities, to be the violation of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall Covenant, &amp; therefore unanimously they resolve to renew that Covenant, &amp; accordingly they draw it up, with some explicatory additions, &amp; confirmations out of the acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, &amp; binde themselves <hi>[to adhere unto,</hi> &amp; <hi>defend the true

Great was this day of the Lords power, for much willingness &amp; chearfulness was among the people; so as in a short time few in all the land did refuse, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept some Papists, some aspiring Courteours, who had no will to displease the King, some who were addicted unto the English rites &amp; Ceremonies, &amp; some few Ministers who had sworne the oath at their entry which was mentioned <hi>Anno</hi> 1612. Yea such willingness was among the nobles &amp; others, that they had their own copies of the Covenant, subscribed by others of the Nobles, Barons, &amp; ministry laid up in their Charter chists, where possibly many of them are at this day.</p>
               <p>When matters are at this passe, the Prelats do animate his Maj. to a war: and the Covenanters desireing his Maj. might be rightly informed wrote unto the <hi>Duke of Lennox, marquis of Hamilton,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Earle of Morton,</hi> to know if his Maj. would accept of a supplication, &amp; sent one unto them to be presented by them, but the king would not look upon it, at length he is moved to send the marquis of <hi>Hamilton</hi> down toward Scotland, to labour by all means to setle peace; But in the mean time, there is a ship sent from <hi>London</hi> with Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition; unto the Castle of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> which because not usuall,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:65203:41"/>
was taken notic of; &amp; the Covenanters, fearing the worst resolved to watch the Castle, that none of it should be taken in. When <hi>Hamilton</hi> cometh down, the Covenanters petition for a free Generall Assembly, &amp; a lawfull Parliament. He replyeth, that he was not able to grant either, unlesse they would render back their subscribed Covenant, but this they could not do, without open perjury: So that he resolveth to returne, but first July 4 he published a Declaration, against which, contrary to their resolution (for they were made to beleeve it was some other thing then indeed it was) they drew up a Protestation, &amp; hearing that the Councell had approved of the said proclamation, they prepare a supplication, but the Councell did not suffer the Act to be recorded, but did tear it in Pieces, &amp; thereafter <hi>Hamilton,</hi> &amp; the most part of the Councell declared solemnely that the act of the Councell was no approbation of the same, but a warrant to the Clerk to cause publish it.</p>
               <p>When the Marquis of <hi>Hamilton</hi> was going back to <hi>London</hi> againe, he promiseth to procure a warrant from his Maj. for a Generall assembly before the 22 of <hi>Septr,</hi> otherways they should have free liberty to appoint one themselves: And when, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his promise, he returneth againe, he bringeth a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation with him, tacitely condemning all the proceedings of the Covenanters, &amp; marring the freedome of an Assembly; and therefore the Covenanters were constrained to make use of a Protestation against it, <hi>Sept</hi> 22. On the same day also did the Councell publish his Maj.

                  <hi>May</hi> 1639. The Kings Navy cometh to <hi>Scotland</hi> with some thousands of men &amp; much provision. The Covenanters send a supplication to his Maj. but in vaine, for nothing is intended but fire &amp; sword. The King approacheth their borders with an army, &amp; the two armies are near to joyne in battell. But God was pleased to prevent the shedding of bloud, by moving the King to a Pacification, wherein the King promiseth &amp; declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that <hi>all causes Ecclesiasticall should be determined by Church Assemblies, and that there should be a Generall Assembly every year once, and that civill matters should be determined by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, That there should be an Assembly held at Edenburgh the 12. of August next, and a Parliament thereafter to ratify the Acts of the Assembly</hi> Whereupon the Scotish forces are disbanded, the Castles are surrendred, &amp; now the whole land looketh for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but peace.</p>
               <p>The Assembly is opened up <hi>August,</hi> 1639. &amp; the Earle of <hi>Traquair</hi> is present as his Maj.

The Covenant was approved in all its heads &amp; clauses, &amp; was subscribed both by <hi>Traquair</hi> his Maj.

comeing to subscribe the Covenant, according to the Generall assemblies declaration, dated August<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 30 1639.</p>
               <p>Now, according to the Pacification, it was expected that these acts should have had the civill Sanction of the parliament which was to sit down the next day after the assembly was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved viz: August: 31. But before any thing was done by the Parliament to this effect, it is commanded to dissolve Decemb. 18. under the paine of treason, &amp; so the Parliament is prorogu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto the 2 of Jun. 1640. The Parliament, for peace, resolve to obey, but because they had never been adjourned nor dissolved formerly without their own consent, &amp; lest this might be a preparative for times to come, they resolved to emitt a Declaration for their exoneration, &amp; caused insert it in the Registers <hi>ad futuram rei memoriam.</hi> And withall they send some of their number unto his Maj. with grievances, &amp; appoint others to attend his Maj. answer at <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> &amp; then they dissolve having first published an Infirmation to the Estates of <hi>England,</hi> concerning the present state of affairs. But these Commissioners, after they had endevoured to give his Maj. sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in all points, according to their Instructions at se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall times, from the 20 of <hi>Febr.</hi> unto the 23 of <hi>March.</hi> 1640. were detained, &amp; afterward the Lord <hi>Loudoun</hi> is put into the <hi>Toure of London</hi> &amp; other three are put under a restrant, contrary to the Law of Nations. A new warr is intended, The Castle of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> is fortified with a hundreth strangers moe &amp; much Ammunition. The Commissioners of the Parliament seeing this, &amp; hearing of an army leavyed in <hi>England</hi> under the conduct of the Earle of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> &amp; how the Deputy of <hi>Irland</hi> with the Nobles there in Parliament had offered a great summe of money, &amp; what stir the prelats of <hi>England</hi> were making at Court, &amp; what offers they were making to carry on this new warr, which they so far owned as to call it <hi>Ballum Episcopale;</hi> they resolve to put the land into a new posture of defence, and emit a Declaration for satisfaction of their friends in <hi>England,</hi> which was so satisfactory, as that many of the lower House of Parliament then sitting, declared that they saw no cause of a warr against Scotland, &amp; therefore would grant no subsidy. But
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:65203:45"/>
this parliament is dissolved, Scottish ships are intercepted, their goods taken away, &amp; the Seamen imprisoned, &amp; miserably handled, all Sea-ports closed up with Frigots, the Kings army advanceth both by sea &amp; land, the Castle of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth the town, &amp; killeth many with shote. Now at the time appointed, Jun. 11. the parliament conveeneth, &amp; lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vieth an army for a new Expedition in defence of the land, &amp; cleareth the equity of the same in a Declaration shewing. 1 how they were necessitated thereunto, being not able to live without traffique, &amp; justice, &amp; to mantaine an army on the borders. 2. That the warr was onely Defensive, the King being stirred up by their adversaries to breake the Articles of Pacification, to imprison their Commissioners, to call Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments in <hi>England</hi> &amp; <hi>Irland</hi> for subsidies for the warr, to take their ships, &amp; imprison their sea-men, &amp; to give Commission to the Governour of the Castle of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> to kill all he could: when they resolved onely to defend themselves, to seek a firme &amp; sure peace, &amp; then to lay down armes after security had for their Religion &amp; liberties. 3. That they were called by the same di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence, by which they had been directed hitherto. 4. That they looked upon none as their enemies but a Canterburi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faction made up of Atheists, Papists, Arminians, &amp; Prelats, the seducers of the King. 5. That their end was not to wrong his Maj. nor to enrich themselves; but Gods glory, the firm peace of both nations, the true honour of the King, &amp; that the enemies of both Kingdomes might be punished. So do they emit another paper for the satisfaction of the good people of <hi>England</hi> clearing their true Intentions: And so do advance with their Army in to England, &amp; take <hi>New Castle,</hi> &amp; before they would advance toward <hi>York,</hi> where the maine body of the Kings Army did lye, they supplicat his maj. at length to consider their greevances; &amp; particularly <hi>to ratifie the last Parliament, that the Scott in England and Irland might be set at liberty, and not forced to take unlawfull oaths that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendiaries might be punished according to justice, the Scottish ships restored, and every thing removed which hindereth free commerce, and tradeing between the two Nations.</hi> Many of the

So is there a letter sent from some brethren of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry in the Church of England subscribed by very many hands, showing how low that poor Church was now brought, being ready to be swallowed up by Satan &amp; his Instruments, that the Protestant Religion was in great hazard, &amp; desiring very af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately their aide &amp; help. <hi>August.</hi> 15. those Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners presente some propositions to the Assembly, which they had a little before, <hi>August.</hi> 12. presented unto the honorable Convention of Estates, desiring that, <hi>because the Popish Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laticall faction is still pursueing their designe of corrupting &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the Religion, through the whole Iland, the two Nations might be strictly united for their mutuall defence against the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, &amp; Prelaticall Faction, &amp; their adherents in both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, &amp; not to lay down armes till those their implacable enemies be disarmed, &amp; subjected to the authority &amp; justice of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in both Kingdoms respectively.</hi> And <hi>that the two Kingdoms might be brought into a near conjunction into one forme of Church go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement, one Directory for worship, one Catechisme, &amp;c. &amp; the foundation laid of the utter extirpation of Popery &amp; Prelacy out of both Kingdoms. The most effectuall &amp; ready means whereunto,</hi> is now conceived to be. That both Nations enter into a strict Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on &amp; League according to the desire of both Houses of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; that for prosecuting the Ends of that Union against the

occasioned great acclamations of joy through the whole land, seing that now the yoke of the oppressour was brocken, and the Lord had restored to them in a wonderfull &amp; unexpected maner their law full judges and governours. Now were people filled with hops of good and desirable dayes both for Church and State. But alace how suddainly are all their hopes turned into fears, and their joy into mourning, how are their faces filled with confusion, because of the sad disappointment which now they did meet with? Their yoke beginneth now to be wreathed more straitly about their necks then ever, their bondage and oppression in conscience groweth, they see with their eyes the glorious worke of Reformation which had been wonderfully carried on by the mighty power of the most High, &amp; cemented with the bloud of his Saints (who spared not their lives in the defence &amp; maintenance of that cause both against malignants &amp; Sectaries) razed to the very foundation, &amp; the carved worke thereof brocken down with axes &amp; hammers at once, and all things growing dayly worse &amp; worse.

               <p>AFter God had broken the yoke of the oppressours, &amp; had restored their own governous, it might have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that justice should have flowed down as a river; and when the committe of Estates which had been nominated <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> 1651.

But alas their little finger becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth heavier then the loyns of the former oppressours: A litle taste of which there is given on the very first day of their sitting downe; for upon the 23.

While there were some faithfull &amp; Zealous servants of Christ, to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Ten Ministers, with one Gentleman, met in a private house (where they resolved to meet that they might give the lesse offence) for the drawing up of a supplication unto his Maj. wherein after their congratulating his Maj. returne, they in all humility, presse &amp; exhort him, in the fear of the Lord, to minde his oaths unto, &amp; covenants with God: a very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary &amp; seasonable work. The <hi>committee of Estates</hi> sent thither some of their number to apprehend those persones, &amp; to take them to the castle of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> where they abode for the space of some weeks, &amp; were afterward (except <hi>Mr Guthry)</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to their chambers in the towne, for some considerable time.

constancy in carrying on the work &amp; cause of God, was taken) But the very truth is, what ever was petended, the true cause was, that which made him so famous; even his zeal &amp; activity for the work of God in his generation; for what ever else they had to lay to his charge, if he had either opposed the work of God, or done as litle for it, as many other, of the Nobles, his life would not have been taken now, more then the life of others, it is true other things were sought to colour this bussinesse, and failing one, another, &amp; failing that, a third, but in end ther is a comprehensive generall set downe as the ground of the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, to this purpose. That he had been an enemy to the king &amp; his interest these 23 yeers or more by past, which in effect is as much as to say; he had been an active friend for the interest of Christ. But because generalls cannot well be proved they condescended on severall particular actings of his in carrying on, in his place &amp; station, the work of reformation, &amp; when all these failed, they fix upon his complyance with the <hi>Englishes</hi> (after they had subdued the land in battell, and forced the king out of his dominions, had garrisoned the whole land, &amp; used it almost as a conquest) by sitting in their parliament when chosen by some shire, and when the rest of the shires of the land had sent their commissioners thither. This his complyance with them, at that time, by sitting in their judicatories, and there concurring with his advice &amp; counsel for the good of the land, that was now under their feet, is the only particular ground upon which his sentence is founded, and the particular speciall cause pretended for which he was condemned to lose his head as a traitour, &amp; to have his head put up on t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

A sentence which question lesse, at first veiu, may make all men of understanding asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, &amp; to wonder, how ever it could have entered into the minde of the parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to sentence unto death, such a peer of the land, such an usefull member of the Kingdome, &amp; an ornament; upon such a ground and for such a cause.

1. The matter of complyance with the Englishes at that time, was so farr from being accounted treasonable that sever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of the lawyers (among whom was one Sr <hi>Iohn Fletcher</hi> who was now advanced to be his Maj. advocat, &amp; did accuse this worthy Nobleman of treason) did swear &amp; subscribe an oath to be faithfull unto the governement, as it was then established without King &amp; house of Lords. Now if there had been trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son really in this deed, either by the civill law, or by the municipall lawes of the land, would not the lawyers have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it whose dayly work &amp; study the lawes are?</p>
               <p n="2">2. If this had been the deed of this nobleman alone, the mater had been lesse to have been wondered at, but it being such a deed whereof few of the nobles of <hi>Scotland</hi> were altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther free: yea whereof many of the members of Parliament his judges were guilty, the matter is beyond a parallel. It is hard to make <hi>secios criminis</hi> sit as judges &amp; condemne the accused: reason would require that the table should be purged. Is it not strange for a Parliament to condemne one for such a fault for which many of their own members might with as much justice &amp; equity be condemned? and is it not strange how they being by their own confession traitours in the heighest degree, could fitt, &amp; judge others? It is true it will be replyed. That his Maj. might pardon whom he pleased, But then it will aboundantly appear that not this, But something else was the cause of this worthy nobleman's death. Whatever may be said in poynt of law, yet it will be a disput in poynt of conscience. If kings may pardon such crimes as do deserve death by the law of God, or if such crimes which kings may pardon, of their own accord, &amp; according to their own good pleasure, do before the Lord, deserve death.</p>

By what municipall law, can any member of the Kingdome be challenged, upon the account of treason, for treating with a conquerour for life &amp; liberty, &amp; for sitting in his councells, for the good of the countrey, after that he with the rest of the body of the land, had foughten in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of King, &amp; countrey till no more could be done, after the whole land had been overcome at severall battels, and wholly overrun; &amp; had acted nothing, for the advantage of the enemy &amp; disadvantage of the king &amp; countrey before the victory obtained; but in all poynts had carryed as became a loyall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject contributing all the help by armes &amp; counsell, which was required: what act of parliament declareth such a deed as this treasonable, &amp; such a subject to deserve death as a traitour?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Was there ever such a <hi>Practique</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> since ever there was a king in it? Severall times was the kingdome of <hi>Scotland</hi> overrun by the kingdome of <hi>England</hi> particularly in the dayes
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:65203:57"/>
of <hi>Baliol,</hi> &amp; at that time King <hi>Edward</hi> caused the Nobles of <hi>Scotland</hi> swear all aidgeance unto him. But when <hi>Bruce</hi> came to be King was there any of the Nobles questioned for treason upon that account? And seing ther can no instance be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced out of the History of <hi>Scotland</hi> since ever it was a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that any subject, noble Man, or other, was accused of high treason, for such a cause, surely this noble Mans case was unparalleled.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Is not this strange considering what the principle of Royallists is? They say that <hi>[Conquest giveth a just tittle to a crown]</hi> So sayeth <hi>D. Ferne, A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>nisaeus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Maxwell</hi> in his <hi>Sacro Sancta Regum Majestas, Cap.</hi> 17. And by this principle <hi>Cromwell</hi> was the lawfull supreme Governour of the Kingdome of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and had just tittle &amp; right to the Crowne thereof, having now conquered the same; &amp; if this principle of theirs be true (which is much questioned by their opposites) no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance with him, could by any law in the World, be treason against any Prince whatsomever, for obedience unto, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence with, a lawful supreme Magistrat can be treason against no man living: How then could this noble Man be challenged upon the account of treason for complyance? Let all the Royalists answer this, without contradicting themselves, if they can.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Is there any lawyer who can produce such a definition of treason against a Prince, or a supreme Magistrat, out of the civil law, as will condemne the deed of this worthy noble Man, &amp; make complyance with a conquerour for the good &amp; saifty of the countrey after all meanes of defence are broken &amp; lost, an act of treason? And since the civil law can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne no such deed as treasonable, the sentence given out against his noble Man, must be without all warrand of law.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Are there not many countreyes, Kingdomes &amp; cities that have been overrun by their enemies, &amp; have had their own lawfull Governours put from them; &amp; so have been forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to live under the feet of strangers; &amp; hath it not been usuall for them to comply with such as had the present power in their hand for their own saifty, &amp; the good of the place? And
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:65203:58"/>
was it ever yet heard that such were accused &amp; condemned of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>reason against their own lawful Governours, thrust from them sore against their wills, for any such complyance? And is it not wonderful that this eminent noble Man should become a preparative unto all the World?</p>
               <p>So then, to put a close to this, let an appeal be made to all Governours of Commonwealths, Statesmen, Lawyers, Casuists, Politicians, Canonists &amp; Quodlib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>

Whether or not, when a land is overcome in battel, once, againe, a thrid time, &amp; a fourth time, so a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Or can they, or any of them, be challenged, or accused, &amp; condemned, as guilty of heigh treason, when providence bringeth back the prince after ten yeers absence, for acting so under the conquerour, for the good of the land, to prevent its utter ruine, &amp; destruction? And if the answer shall (as certainly it will) be negative, then it is beyond all question that the sentence &amp; execution of this worthy noble Man, upon this sole account, shall be matter of astonishment to all that hear of it &amp; know the cause thereof.</p>
               <p>Thus a great prince falleth, &amp; within five dayes therafter, a great prophet falleth as shall be shown in the next section.</p>

wonderfull, if thou consider, how as thou hast heard, many worthy &amp; precious servants of christ, did decline the King, &amp; his councell in the dayes of King <hi>Iames,</hi> such as Mr <hi>Balean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual,</hi> Mr <hi>Melvin,</hi> Mr <hi>Blake,</hi> Mr <hi>Welch,</hi> Mr <hi>Forbes</hi> &amp; others as incompetent judges in causes meerly ecclesiasticke; and yet ther was never one of them put to death.

But which is more there is an Act of Parl. <hi>Anno</hi> 1592. declareing that that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Act <hi>shall no wayes be prejudiciall, nor derogat any thing to the privilege, that God hath given to the spirituall office bearers of the church, concerning heads of religion, matters of heresy, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, collation or deprivation of ministers, or any such like essentiall censures, specially grounded</hi> &amp; <hi>have and warrand of the word of God.</hi> And which is more considerable. The parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment 1648. did disclaime any such power of judging in church matters, &amp; took it for an unjust challenge &amp; charge, to say, that they took an antecedent judgment in maters of religion, for in their letter to the presbyteries of <hi>Scotland</hi> being their <hi>Act 16.

                  <p>The sufferings of some other Ministers related.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AMong other acts of the <hi>Committy of Estates</hi> there was a proclamation, which they caused be read, at all the church doores of the Kingdome upon the Lord's day; in which they discharged ministers to speak or preach any thing against them, or their proceedings: &amp; this was to command them to handle the word of the Lord deceitfully, to become false prophets, &amp; to preach smooth things and to prophecy deceits: wherby the malicious &amp; ill affected people who did not love their ministers were encouraged to give in delations of such &amp; such things as they thought good to allaidge against them as uttered in their sermones &amp; bring in any prophane persones they pleased for witnesses. By which meanes, some (though many were in no hazard thinking it commendable prudence to be silent at such a time) were brought to trouble both by the <hi>Committe of Estates</hi> &amp; by the <hi>Parliament,</hi> being imprisoned or confined and other wayes hardly used though litle of what was allaidged,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:65203:60"/>
could be proved against them. More over ther was one mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, who after the Parliament had annulled the covenant, &amp; passed many other acts against the work of reformation, thought himself bound in conscience to give faithfull &amp; free warning, &amp; to shew the greatnesse of the sin of backslideing &amp; defection from the cause and truth of God; &amp; to protest publikely in a Ministeriall way for his own exoneration, after the example of <hi>Samuel</hi> at the comandement of God, against the course of defection carryed on, &amp; all acts made, in prejudice of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanted worke of reformation: for which cause he was sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned before the Parliament and at length condemned of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son &amp; sedition onely upon that acount, &amp; therafter was ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished out of all his Maj. dominions. And if any say that ministers should have been silent &amp; not meddled with state af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs let the answers which famous doct. <hi>Voet:</hi> giveth in his <hi>Politia Eccles.</hi> pag. 982. 983. &amp;c. be considered, which are these. 1. It is the duty of Ministers to give faithfull warning unto people, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3: 17, 22. 2. This was not to meddle with the politie, but with the abuse of it by men in power. 3. Rulers no lesse then others must be touched when they provoke God to wrath by their carriage, 1 <hi>Thes. 5: 11. Iam. 5: 20. 1 Sam. 15: 14. Isa.</hi> 58. 1. 4. Then they should never speake to a hundered pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of scripture, which do speake so directly against Magistrats abuseing their power. See what he sayeth furder to this purpose there: in answering therest of the objections, &amp; how he clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it from <hi>Act. 7: 51. Hos. 2: 1. Dan.</hi> 3. &amp; 6. <hi>Act.</hi> 4. &amp; 5. &amp; 6. <hi>Hos. 4. 15. Iud.</hi> v. 23.</p>
               <p>About this same time there is another minister banished <hi>indictâ causà</hi> for while he was going towards <hi>Irland</hi> upon some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular occasion he was brought back By the command of <hi>the committee of Estates</hi> &amp; committed to prisone untill the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Parliament, &amp; then receiveth summones of treason, to which when he had desired some time to answere, he is sent back to prisone, &amp; when he expecteth to be called upon to give in his defences, he was sentenced with banishment out of his Maj. dominions.</p>

And which is more to be wondered at. Neither these two ministers nor any other who were afterward banished, as shall be showne, could ever to this day, get an extract of their sentence, which no judicature in the world could ever have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuised in equity &amp; justice: yea because the power of the <hi>Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament</hi> &amp; <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> could reach no furder then their own bounds, &amp; so could banish none any further then out of <hi>Scotland;</hi> they devise another way &amp; draw up a bonde where in the subscriber bindeth himself under the paine of death, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move out of all his Maj. dominions betwixt &amp; such a day &amp; not to returne without license under the paine of death, &amp; this bond, they caused the banished ministers subcribe, before witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; which they were all necessitated to do to save themselves from worse.

appoint anniversary holy Dayes, the Creator alone having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served that power into his own hand, to consecrate any portion of time he pleaseth, &amp; make it holy; So as holy duties must attend it, as holy duties &amp; acts of worship, attend the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both-day, the only holy Day which is now warranted, by the Word of God.

Neither let any say that it was out of disrespect to his Maj. that any Minister did refuise to countenance the work of that day; For all of them did willingly keep a day of solemne thankesgiving, at his coming home; And Presbyteries, &amp; Synods did chearfully appoynt dayes for that effect.

               <p>A Little after his Maj. returne he was pleased to write unto the Presbytery of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> (who were to communicat it unto the rest of Presbyteries of the Kingdom) a gracious let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, (as it was called) wherin he promised to owne &amp; to countenance the government of the Church as it was establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by law, wherby many took him to meane Presbyterian go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; But others feared a designe to overturne Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian government &amp; to introduce Prelacy (as afterward it came to passe) &amp; when the Parliament did rescinde all acts, &amp; sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes made in favours of Presbyterian government &amp; did devolve the power of setling the government of the Church upon his Maj. they did by their, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. allow the present administration by <hi>Sessions, Presbyteries,</hi> &amp; <hi>Synods</hi> for a time.

               <p>But therafter when these foure returne from <hi>London,</hi> &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrat the rest, there were acts made in the second, session of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament viz. <hi>Anno 1662. redintegrating them to the exercise of their episcopall function, &amp; to all their privileges, dignities, jurisdictions, &amp; possessions due &amp; formerly belonging thereunto:</hi> as also there is an act <hi>ordaincing all ministers to repaire unto the diocesian assembly &amp; concur in all the acts of Church discipline as they should be therunto required by the Archbishops, or Bishop of the diocese, under the paine of being suspended from their office &amp; benifice till the next diocesian meeting, for the first fault, &amp; if they amended not, to be deprived, &amp; the Church to be declared vacand.</hi> But notwithstanding of this act, all such ministers as resolved to keep a good conscience, did forbear to goe unto these meetings, or unto the other meetings, which they call <hi>exercises,</hi> in which meetings, the prelate, &amp; such as he named, did not only preside, but ruled as they pleased; Not only because the privileges of the judicatories were encro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ached upon, &amp; wronged by the Prelate, presideing at his own hand, without the consent of the rest, contrary to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant practice of that Church, &amp; because a constituent member of these judicatures viz the <hi>ruleing elder</hi> was excluded, contrare to the principles of presbyterian government, the practice of that Church from the begining, the practice of all other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed churches, &amp; of the primitive Church, &amp; contrary to

the judgment of many eminent divines both there, and abroad, who have clearly made it to appear out of the scriptures that Christ hath instituted such officers.

                     </gap>sian meetings,</hi> &amp; not <hi>Synods</hi> &amp; <hi>Presbiteries)</hi> but also in thing. The former judicatories are razed, &amp; over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, &amp; these new meetings are erected upon a new <hi>Basis</hi> the Kings power &amp; perogative to setle what forme of Church go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment he thinketh best; &amp; they are now authorized &amp; order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the prelates: &amp; so they are pieces &amp; partes of the prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall government, &amp; therefore they are distinct from what they were before: So that no minister that made conscience of his covenant &amp; vow for presbyterian goverment &amp; against prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall could with peace &amp; freedome, keep or countenance these meetings.</p>
               <p>It is replyed by the prelates procurator, the new casuist in his pamphlet called <hi>the seasonable case</hi> etc. pag. 12. <hi>That the meetings now &amp; before are of the same constitution, nothing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, nor any more holding of Bishops now when the Kings Maj. hath taken off the restraint which for a time, he putt on, then if he had not at all restrained them.</hi> But this is no satisfactory ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were his meet deny all will not availe much with indifferent men of understanding, for the difference is clear: because 1. for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, Church judicatories had power within themselves to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minat, &amp; appoynt their own moderator, now it is not so 2. Formerly, Church judicatories, &amp; Church power, did flow from the Lord <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> immediatly, as being the only head of his Church, now they flow from another fountaine: viz the King as the fountaine of all Church power, &amp; therefore is the goverment called <hi>his majesties governement ecclesiasticall</hi> in the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>councell Iuly</hi> 10. 1663. &amp; the prelats in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of their office are said to do <hi>service to his Maj. in the Church</hi> in the <hi>act of councell Ian.</hi> 9. 1662. 3. Formerly, Church judicatories did meddle with every scandal, now they
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:65203:64"/>
must meddle with no more then the prelat pleaseth. 4. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, presbyters had power to voyce &amp; to determine by their decisive suffrage, now they are but the prelates counsellours, of whose counsell &amp; advice he maketh what use he thinketh fitt. 5. Formerly, there was none in those judicatories who had a negative voyce, now the Bishop hath it, &amp; the rest are but cyphres. 6. Formerly, in these judicatories ther were ruleing elders: but now that constituent member is not admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which particular alone will sufficiently evidence that the face &amp; frame of the judicature is altered. And since it is so; any man of understanding may easily perceive, such a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence as maketh those meetings now to depend upon the King: &amp; upon the prelat, who hath a negative voice in them, &amp; whose dioecesian meetings they are, being now modelled conforme to the number of prelats, whileas before in some dioecies there were three provinciall Synods. Moreover the passage which was cited before out of the <hi>Proclamation, Ian.</hi> 15. 1662. cleareth this aboundantly; for there it is said expresly, that the administration of the Church in the way it had been, (that is the administration of presbyterian go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment) is inconsistent with that which is now establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or Episcopall goverment; and the councell is better to be beleeved then this man who speaketh without ground. againe why did <hi>King</hi> &amp; <hi>Councell</hi> discharge those meetings, but because they were making way for the setling of Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacie? and finally why is the jurisdiction and exercise of Church discipline, which was allowed for a time, set in opposition, [to the jurisdiction &amp; exercise of Church Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ordered in the respective synods, presbyteries &amp; sessions, by the appoyntment &amp; authority of the Archbishops, &amp; Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops thereof, according to their known privilege &amp; practice conforme therto.] If not to clear this difference.</p>
               <p>He objecteth pag. 8. &amp; sayeth <hi>[That the supreme Magistrat hath undowbted power to convocat synods, when he seeth it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full—&amp; no protestant minister would refuise to come, at his comand; nor is there any ranke or degree of subjects, that can without the staine of sinfull disobedience, refuise to meet upon his
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:65203:64"/>
Maj. command, and ministers cannot plead exemption from the common duties of subjects]</hi> It is answered. 1. It is true ministers are subjects no lesse then others; &amp; are obliged in conscience to subject themselves Unto the civill Magistrat, in the Lord, no lesse then others; But. 2. Neither mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters nor others are bound at the Magistrat's command to sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God, it being alwayes better to obey God then man &amp; here in obeying this command, Ministers, should have hainonsly sinned against God, for. 1. They should have therby acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, upon the matter, that the Magistrats power, in Church matters, is such, as that, he may appoynt what forme of Goverment he will, which no presbyterian, in conscience, could yeeld to, without wronging of Christ, the head &amp; King of his Church; as shall in due time be made furder to appear. 2. They should have therby testified, &amp; acknouledged their approbation of Episcopall Goverment, contrary to their oath &amp; subscription, for this was pressed as a badge of conformitie, &amp; signe of subjection unto Episcopall Goverment; as the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation</hi> of the <hi>Privie Councell</hi> before mentioned doth abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly clear, &amp; these meetings are meer episcopall meetings as is showne. 3.

                  </gap>as to the ground of the objection viz. That the Magistrat hath power to convocate synods; It would require a longer time then can be now allowed to discusse the same, &amp; to try, how, &amp; in what cases, it willhold good. But this is certane that the judgment of the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> as to this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, as may be seen in the <hi>Act</hi> of Assembly <hi>Anno</hi> 1647. approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the confession of faith, &amp; prefixed therunto) is <hi>that in Churches constituted (such as the Church of Scotland was) the Magistrats authority is not sufficient to call a Synod without any other call, that is, without delegation from their Churches, &amp; that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> is free, to Ministers, to Assemble together synodically as well, prorenata, as at the ordinary times, upon delegaetion from the Churches by their intrinsecall power received from Christ, as often as it is necessary, in case the Magistrat deny his consent]</hi> But be it granted (as in some cases it may.) Yet it will not follow that therefore Ministers were bound in conscience to have countenanced those meetings; and that for these reasons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:65203:65"/>
1. Because, these were no extraordinary Synods called by his Maj. <hi>prore nata.</hi> Nor. 2. Were they any of the former Synods, used while presbyterian Goverment was in force. But. 3. They were new meetings, upon new principles, having their rise from a new spring, &amp; fountaine, &amp; consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted otherwise in a new forme, and so, they were no meetings consonant unto the principles of presbyterian Goverment, but wholly dissonant, &amp; meetings complying with, &amp; flowing from, Episcopall power &amp; jurisdiction, &amp; ordered by prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall authority &amp; appoyntment. 3. Countenanceing of these meetings, upon the matter, would have been an assenting &amp; consenting unto, the pulling down of presbyterian Governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which they were sworne to maintaine. 4. Yea it would have been a fearful matter of offence &amp; stumbling unto the godly &amp; truely tender; &amp; a hardening of others, who had complyed; &amp; withall a dangerous casting of themselves into temptation, as experience doth abundantly prove dayly: and therefore this comand could not be obeyed; for no command of a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrat can warrand any to sin, by doing that which is, in it self, sinfull yea or what is a reall ground of offence unto others (provideing the matter be not absolutely necessary, antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, unto the command of the Magistrat.)</p>
               <p>But he addeth <hi>[Is this rationall that where two commands of the Magistrat are joyned, the one undowbtedly lawfull, the other dowbt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of; that subjects should disobey the Magistrat in that which is clearly lawfull, because <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>ey have a dowbt or unclearnesse anent obeying him in the other command—had they come to the place it would</hi> protanto <hi>have shewed their respect unto authority]</hi> Ans. It is a great question if this man speake rationally here: doth he thinke that the civill Magistrat did intend two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands in that one? he may as well say that he did intend twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: will he so metaphisically anatomize the commands of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells &amp; Parliaments, as to render them ridiculous? would he have had ministers sporting &amp; jesting in such a serious matter, with the supreme Magistrat? if the Ministers had come't to towne &amp; seen what of the cloke it was, &amp; then returned home, would this casuist have cleared them either <hi>protanto</hi> or <hi>prototo.</hi>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:65203:65"/>
Nay, he would without all doubt, have exaggerated that crime, as the height of contempt, &amp; as an open preaching &amp; proclameing of their contempt unto the world. But in such a sad declineing time the faithfull ministers of Christ had some other thing to think upon, then thus to sport themselves, &amp; mocke authority by halveing orquartering the commands and injunctions thereof, &amp; therefore would neither get on horse backe, nor come half the way, not to the place appoynted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they might not in conscience concurr with the prelat there, in that dioecesian meeting, which was the onely thing commanded, &amp; their coming to the towne, was no more commanded, (save as subservient thereunto) then their riseing out of their Bed that morning, or their taking horse, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In the 3 place he addeth <hi>[What ground could they have for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, from the Synod? is it the want of liberty to choose a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator or is it that he who presideth is a Bishop, and claimeth more power then they can allow-as of a negative voyce; or is it the want of unpreaching elders in the meeting?]</hi> It is Ans; Neither any of these alone, nor all of them together, are the full and compleat ground; but this. That it is a meeting called to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by the civill Magistrat, assumeing to himself, power to cast downe the established government of the Church, &amp; the primitive governement, &amp; to settle what kinde of government he thinketh fit, as best complying with his own &amp; his subjects humors, &amp; who accordingly hath razed to the fundation pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian government, unto which, both he &amp; all the lands were sworne: and is setting up prelatical government, against which he &amp; all the lands have sworne, of which, these three particulars mentioned, are so many evidences: And that they are so, cannot be denyed; for. 1. Whatever truth be in this assertion. That ecclesiasticke judicatories have a divine war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand for chooseing their own moderator. This is clear &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyable, that while presbyteriall governement was in its inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity &amp; vigour, the assemblies of the Church nationall, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall &amp; presbyteriall, had this privilege to elect their own mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator, &amp; when ever prelats began to rise &amp; get entrance in
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:65203:66"/>
that Church, this incroachment among other shee did suffer at their hands, for they knew that <hi>Invasio perpetuae dictaturae</hi> would be <hi>via ad Imperium.</hi> Constant moderators would usher the way for domineering prelats (as was showne Sect. 1.) And therefore this is a clear evidence of the change of the government from presbyteriall to prelaticall. furder though that which <hi>Zep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perus</hi> sayeth viz <hi>Presides ecclesiastici,</hi> &amp;c. that is <hi>the moderators or presidents of the ancient councells were some time named by the emperour</hi> be true; yet it will be a mere <hi>non sequitur</hi> to conclude thence, as this author doth viz <hi>That it is lawfull for the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Magistrat, upon whom the externall ordering of all the judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories in his dominions depends, to nominat out of a meeting of ministers, conveened by him, one of the number, to order the actions of the meeting, and by his authority to controle the unruly,</hi> not only as being a concludeing of a generall from a particular; but as being a putting into the conclusion, what is not in the premisses, &amp; a mixing of heterogeneous things together. What he meaneth by this <hi>externall ordering of judicatories</hi> who can tell? unlesse it be all that power which ordinarily is exerced by a moderator; &amp; will he say that the Magistrat ought to choose all the moderators? Hath the supreme Magistrat any more interest in those meetings, or hath he so much, as he hath in civill meetings? &amp; doth he appoynt all the mouthes of these meetings? But have not Church judicatories within themselves, power for their own externall ordering? who then ordered the Synod at <hi>Ierusalem?</hi> Act. 15. To say the Magistrat was not then Christian &amp; therefore it did not belong unto him, is enough to prove that it doth not belong to him as a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strat. But there is enough said to this here, which is but bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly asserted by him without proof: And. 2. As to the next what ever be asserted concerning that which Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> &amp; <hi>Mr Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es</hi> (as he reporteth of them) say, viz. [That for peace, pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters may suspend the exercise of there just authority, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve to give to one person of their number a negative voice.] (though many moe divines with greater reason think, that seing God hath given them no power whereof they may denude themselves when they think fit, &amp; suspend the exercise of at the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:65203:66"/>
node of any other, It cannot be lawfull for them to give that negative voice unto any) yet this is undenyable. that there never was any such thing claimed by, nor granted to any, all the time that that Church enjoyed presbyterian government &amp; it is as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyable, that so soon as prelates gote up, unto their chaires they challenged that negative voice to themselves, as their due, &amp; took it whether presbyters would or not; &amp; so have the prelats done to day; &amp; therefore this concession of these eminent men were it never so true, as it is denyed by many, is nothing to the poynt; for by this one particular, it is as clear as the noonday that the government is altered from presbyterian to Episcopal, &amp; therefore though it be true that the personall fault of another cannot be a good ground for brethrens withdrawing from their duty; yet when by their concurrence to consult alone (when by God's law they have equall authority with any that sitteth there) they shall consent unto that change of government, it becometh sin &amp; not duty: for now all presbyterian government is overturned, they see prelats set up as before; so that if they concurre they cannot avoide sin. To say (as he doth a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, pag. 8. <hi>(that it might be permitted to them if they intrested for it, to ease their consciences, by signifying their scruples, so be, they would do it with that inossensive modesty, humility and res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect unto the supreme authority, &amp; to the lawes of the land</hi> is to please the simple (that beleeve every thing) with a faire word, for it behoved to be done with such in-offensive modesty, &amp; humility, as no body should either hear or know of it, otherwise, they might be sure it would be accounted dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respect unto the supreme authority, &amp; to the lawes of the land &amp; they might expect presently to be attached &amp; processed. Lastly as to the 3 particular, whether the opinion of <hi>Mr Vines Mr Baxter</hi> &amp; <hi>Blondell</hi> (if he speak truth) in denying the divine right of ruleing elders, be assented unto; or rather the contrary opinion, which is owned by so many Churches &amp; professours, &amp; particularly by the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> from the begining; yet this is clear that that Church had still such officers, so long as she was governed <hi>Communi consilio presbyteroruns: by presbyteries,</hi> &amp; no sooner did prelats usurpe the place, but they shouldered
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:65203:67"/>
these officers to the door: and therefore this is another palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble evidence that the nature of these meetings is changed, from presbyterian to Episcopall, so that to concurre, by mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with the prelats at their dioecesian meetings, must be an approving of prelacy, &amp; this cannot be done without per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurie.</p>
               <p>But he objecteth pag. 12. Thus <hi>[Our worthy ancestours choosed rather to c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

So that it is but a meer falshood, to say [that the meetings then &amp; now are of the same constitution, nothing altered;] for, then they were hedges standing in the prelats way, though much we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>akened, by reason of the civill power opposeing; but now they are props to support &amp; strengthen the hands of the prelats, as being wholly ruled &amp; guided by them.</p>
               <p>By what is said, it is hoped, that tender Christians will see that there was no small ground of scrupleing at these meeting &amp;
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:65203:67"/>
that they will be loth, rashly to condemne such, as feared to transgresse in the least, &amp; resolved rather to suffer then to sin; seing it is now beyond controversie that their concurring in those meetings, had been upon the matter a consenting unto, &amp; an approving of prelaticall government, upon which account alone, the faithfull servants of Christ did refuise to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre.</p>

That before the year 1649. the Church was groaning under that sore oppression of laick patrons, having power to presente Ministers unto benefices; and then the Parliament was pleased to discharge all presentations of Kirks &amp; patronages whether belonging to the King, or to any laick patron, upon good &amp; weighty grounds as the narrative of their 39 act <hi>March</hi> 9. 1649. sheweth in these words <hi>[The Estates of parliament being sensible of the great obligation, that lyeth upon them, by the nationall Covenant, &amp; by the solemne league &amp; covenant, &amp; by many delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances &amp; mercies from God, &amp; by the late solemne engadgment unto

ties. To preserve the doctrine and maintaine and vindicate the liberties of the Kirk of Scotland, and to advance the work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation therein to the utmost of their power: &amp; considering that patronages and presentations of Kirks, is an evill and bondage under which the Lords people, and Ministers of this land, have long groaned, and that it hath no warrand in God's word, but is founded only on the commonlaw, and is a custome popish, and brought into the Kirk in time of ignorance and superstition, and that the same is contrary to the second book of discipline; in which upon solide and good ground, it is reckoned among abuses that are desired to be reformed, and unto severall acts of the generall assembly: and that it is prejudiciall to the liberty of the people, and planting of Kirks, and unto the free calling and entering of Ministers unto their charge.]</hi> And after this Ministers entered by the call of the people of whom they were to have charge. Now this Parliament will have this piece of reformation undone, &amp; the Church brought back unto her old state of bondage, &amp; so will have Ministers to seek for these presentations, &amp; thereafter, to go to the Bishop for his license &amp; approbation to officiat &amp; exerce the Ministeriall function.</p>
               <p>But the faithfull &amp; zealous servants of <hi>Christ</hi> had not free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome nor liberty to do either of these, &amp; therefore resolved to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, rather then to sin.</p>
               <p>They had not freedome to go to seek a presentation, for these reasons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because, they saw no warrand for such a way of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Ministery allowed of Christ, or his apostles, nor practised many hundereds of years thereafter, and therefore toapprove of such a way had been a sin.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Church had been long groaning under that oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, &amp; bondage, &amp; was desireous to be rid thereof, at the very beginning, but could never obtaine it untill. <hi>An</hi> 1649 Now if they had obeyed this act. &amp; submitted unto this oppression, they had consented unto the spoileing of the Church of her pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, and had condemned that worthy &amp; renowned Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who were graciously moved of God, to take off this Yoke off her necke.</p>

3. They should, in so far, have consented unto the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection now carryed on; for this was a piece thereof. The restoreing of the Church unto her rights &amp; privileges, was a part of the work of reformation yea &amp; no small part thereof, &amp; when this privilege is taken away, the work of reformation is in so far overturned; &amp; therefore such as would have sought presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, should have made defection themselves, &amp; have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented unto, &amp; approved of the Parliament in carrying on the worke of defection, in so far.</p>
               <p n="4">4. By the 36 act of the first Session of this Parliament. It is <hi>ordained that the person to be presented shall in presence of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, or his atturney, and of the sheriffe of the shire. Stewart of the Stewartry, or heretable baily, or commissar of the bounds of it be in the countrey, and of the Magistrats of the brughs within the brugh before the granting, and their accepting of the presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, Take and subscribe the oath of alleagiance otherwise his presentation is null and void of it self.</hi> Now as shall be showne hereafter, no man could with a saife conscience, take that oath as it was tendred by this Parliament.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They should have thereby condemned the manner of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections by the people, &amp; consequently themselves, as being hitherto intruders because entering into the Ministery, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a lawfull call, viz without the presentation of the patron.</p>
               <p>But it will be objected. That all the ministers of <hi>Scotland</hi> who entered before the year 1649. should by this meanes, be condemned as intruders, entering without a lawfull call. Ans: Though patronages cannot but be condemned, as sinfull, tending to ruine the Church, &amp; to defraude her of much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage (beside the spoiling &amp; robeing her of her privileges &amp; liberties, which are purchased to her, by the blood of Christ) because, the patron (who sometime, may be a prophane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, &amp; a persecuter) either hath not understanding, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the spirits, or will not make choise of the best &amp; most able minister: Yet such as entered that way, before the year 1649. cannot altogether be condemned, partly because then the evill of it, was not so fully seen &amp; perceived; partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that evill had not been reformed, &amp; there was no other

way of entry practised, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> practicable by law; &amp; so though they might groan under that burden; yet they could no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> get it helped; &amp; so their fault was lesse then the fault of such would be, who have now seen this evill reformed &amp; have seen (or at least might have seen) the evill of it, &amp; have been called orderly &amp; duely conforme to the way of Election set down in the new testament, for imitation; how great should the guilt of such be, if they should now againe lick up that vo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ite, &amp; submit unto that yoke? More may be said, for the justifying of those who sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit unto a yoke, under which they were borne, &amp; from which neither they, nor their forefathers were delivered, then of those who have been delivered &amp; yet consent againe to goe under the yoke, &amp; thereby do, betray the precious interests of Christ's Church, &amp; with the rown hands, wreeth that yoke about the neck of the Church under which she had been groaning many a year before.</p>
               <p>It will be objected againe. That they have already the consent of the people, being called by them before; &amp; so the Churches liberties are preserved, &amp; their entry is valid enough. Ans. It is true, they have had the call of the people; but that will not make their complyance with this course of defection, the lesse sinfull; but rather the more; for by their taking pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations now, they do upon the matter declare that they were not duely called before; and so they condemne the way of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try by election, as not lawfull, &amp; say that the way of entry by presentations from patrons, is the only lawfull way: for the patrons presentation is not cumulative unto, but privative &amp; destructive of the peoples liberty of free election; because where patrons do presente, the peoples suffrages are never asked; &amp; where people have power to elect, patrons have no place to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent: so that the one destroyeth the other; &amp; therefore if any who have been called by the people &amp; freely chosen should now take presentations, it would import that in their judgment, they were never duely called till now, &amp; this were to annull their former election which they had from the people.</p>
               <p>Next (which was to them of greater moment) they could not with freedome of conscience, goe to the prelate &amp; seek colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for these reasone<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p n="5">5.

               <p>It is objected against this by the author of <hi>the seasonable case</hi> pag. 15. That <hi>thereverend persones instructed by law, to call for that promise from ministers, do not search into mens apprehensions concerning the grounds of their power: all they seek of them, is obedience to them, in things lawfull and honest, as being presently in power, being by law ordinary overseers of the ministry in their duties, and chief ordainers of them who enter into the ministery,</hi> Ans. There is enough here to deterre any from this bussinesse for. 1. There is no warrand in the word to owne them as chief ordainers; there are no chief &amp; inferiour ordainers men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the word; this then must be a fiction &amp; a humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, which no minister must acknowledge; for all must goe to the law, &amp; to the testimony 2. nor is there any such power known to appertain to any man, to be an overseer of the ministry. It is true the spirit of the prophets is subject to the prophets; but there is no warrand for a Bishop over Bishops, or for such an officer as is to oversee the ministers: No officers must be owned in Christ's house but such as are of Christ's own appoyntment. 3. And any other law cannot be owned in those matters. Though the law of the land should give to any such a power, subjects are not for that, obliged to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge &amp; approve of them, as such: The municipall lawes of a land will not warrand any new office or officer in Christ's house. It appertaineth alone to Christ as King &amp; head of his owne house &amp; Church to institute his officers: And it is a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full incroaching upon the privileges of the crowne of Christ, for any state or potentate to take upon them to appoynt such offices &amp; officers, as Christ hath not appoynted. Therefore whether those persones (reverend or irreverend all is one) that are so intrusted by law, to call for such promises &amp; engadgments,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:65203:70"/>
do search into mens apprehensions, concerning the grounds of their power, or not; yet the very promiseing of obedience in things lawfull (for in things unlawfull, obedience must not be promised to any lawfull power under heaven) is an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of the lawfulnesse of their power, &amp; of subjection as due unto them, &amp; an owneing of them as lawfull officers, lawfully installed &amp; authorized, &amp; because this could not be done, therefore neither could the other be done.</p>
               <p>He replyeth. 1. <hi>It is not obedience under a reduplication, and as formally obedience, they call for, If it be obedience materiall they are satisfied</hi> Ans. And what more doth the most lawfull power under heaven ask do they search into the principles of mens doing such &amp; such acts? do they examine the reduplications un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which they act? But. 2. Whether they call for it under that reduplication or not, It is reall obedience they call for, and. 3.

Then. 1. Prelats are nothing else but the Magistrats commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, &amp; have no power or authority <hi>jure divino</hi> by any warrant of Gods law, more then any other of the Magistrat's commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. 2. whence had the prelats, in the first three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered yeers (if so be there was any such, as this author is bold enough to affirme but faileth in his undertaking to prove it) their commission? had they it from <hi>Nero,</hi> &amp; the rest of the persecuting heathenish Emperours? and if they had no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission from them, whence had they their power? or by what commission did they act? or how could they be Bishops with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:65203:71"/>
such a commission? How will this advocat extricate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self out of these difficulties &amp; evite a contradiction? But. 3. If they be the Magistrat's commissioners in causes ecclesiasticke their power must reach no further then the Magistrats power doth, in Church causes, viz the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Then he must say that their chief power in ordination, their chief (if not, only) power in juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, floweth from the Magistrat, &amp; by vertue of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission they act in that sphaere &amp; capacity: and if he say so he speaketh plainely, but without any ground in the word: for then Magistrats might ordaine alone, at least have a chief hand in ordaineing with others; for what they may commissionate others to do in their name, they may do themselves: But how or what way shall we see this proved? Where will he shew any example of any Magistrat, as such, ordaineing or deposeing Ministers, censureing or excommunicating Offenders, since the World began? What a wilde notion must this be then? And if this be the <hi>Basis</hi> which is so rotten let any judge what the superstructure must be. It were tedious here to lanch forth, into this debate concerning the Magistrats power in Church matters: But sure, it was never the doctrine of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:65203:71"/>
be done by the commissioner, and that the person granting the commission might himself do that which he commissionateth others to do. See this consequence fully cleared by famous <hi>Voc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Polit: Eccles.</hi> pag. 146. arg. 12. But now if there were no more to hinder any from acknowledging such a power in the prelats this is sufficient, that it is granted they have all that power over presbyters by being his Maj. commissioners, &amp; that they have all that power derived from him; &amp; consequently, that they have no such power at all: because he from whom they derive that power by a commission hath no such power himself: The confession of faith of the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth no such power in the civill Magistrat. The scripture<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>, by which all are to regulat their actions in the Church of God, giveth warrand for no such power. No re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed divine (except Arminians &amp; Erastians) doth acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge any such power; nor any confession of faith of any of the reformed Churches. Behold then Reader &amp; see what mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters the Prelats are, swollen up to that bignesse, with mere winde &amp; phancies; &amp; observe by what art they ascend, They make the supreme Magistrat beleeve that all the power belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto him to the end, he may devolve it back againe over on them by a commission, &amp; so authorize them: according to that. <hi>Tu facis hunc dominum te facit ille deum.</hi> Thus you see they derive their power <hi>a non-habente potestatem.</hi> from such as have it not to give: therefore their commission is <hi>simpliciter</hi> null, &amp; cannot be acknowledged by any faithfull minister or Christian: Nor can their power be submitted unto. And hence also it is clear what reason these honest Ministers had to refuise, this acknowlegment, &amp; not to take the canonicall oath: which was so contradictory unto the oath of the Covenant.</p>
               <p>But he replyeth <hi>[That there is no contradiction betwixt the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and that canonicall oath, or promise of obedience to the prelate because</hi> Timorcus <hi>(who is tender in the matter of oaths) maintaineth that the ministers who of old took the canonical oath, did not swear the contradictory there to when they took the covenant wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>nce it will follow necessaryly, that they who have taken the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant do not contradict that oath, if they should take the oath of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:65203:72"/>
canonical obedience]</hi> Ans. Though this canonicall oath should not contradict the second article of the league &amp; Covenant, yet there is good cause why it should be refuised, as hath been showne, and furder what warrand is there for any to require such an oath? Oaths must be warranted by the law of God, &amp; there must be a law for imposeing, &amp; so for taking of the oath. It is true Magistrats may impose an oath upon their subjects, &amp; so upon ministers, as well as others, in things not sinfull; &amp; when necessity calleth for it; but that the Magistrat may give unto any of his subjects such a power as he hath not himself, &amp; impower that subject to impose an oath upon others, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him to be lawfully so impowered, &amp; to obey him as one lawfully so impowered, will not be so easily granted without proof, which will not be seen in haste, it being so contrary to the word of God. But 2. The taking of this oath, &amp; promiseing obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto them, is poynt blancke contrary unto the league &amp; Covenant, sworne &amp; subscribed. And that because by the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant they are sworne to endeavour, in their places &amp; callings the extirpation of such Church officers as <hi>Bishops</hi> &amp; <hi>Archbishops,</hi> &amp; this is inconsistent with any owneing or acknowledging of them, under that notion; and if any should promise obedience to them as <hi>Archbishops,</hi> or <hi>Bishops</hi> is it imaginable how that withall they should not owne &amp; acknowledge them? what more owneing &amp; acknowledging can they desire, then submission &amp; a promise of obedience in all things lawfull. 2. And he hath a phancy (I shall not say a judgment) strongly prepossessed with prejudice at truth, who can say, with this author that <hi>[it will be hard to finde out a contradiction there, either in termes or by necessarie consequence]</hi> for a stronger contradiction is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imaginable then betwixt an edeavour to extirpat such or such governours; and a humble submission unto, &amp; acknowledgment of their power, with a promise of faithfull obedience there unto: for he who is bound to endeavour to extirpat them, must never owne them as lawfull officers lawfully impowered, he must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver submit unto them nor promise obedience unto them; for a promise of obedience, is a promise of owneing of them, as lawfull officers. &amp; so a promise of defending them in their place
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:65203:72"/>
&amp; power, in a lawfull manner: and this is diametrically op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite unto an endeavour to extirpat them. 3. As for <hi>Timor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> whom he looketh on as favouring his conceite, it will be found after try all, that notwithstanding of that which he grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, yet he is of an opinion contrary to this author, as any may see, who will take a vieu of his answer unto that part of the objection (which he is about to answere in cap. 7.) which concerneth the oath of canonicall obedience. The objection is this. The league &amp; covenant is contradictory to other oaths sworne before, such as the oath of canonicall obedience, &amp; therefore is void <hi>ipso facto.</hi> To which he answereth. 1. Thus <hi>suppose</hi> (&amp; his supposall is an assertion if he speak to the poynt) <hi>That upon mature deliberation the Ministers that subscribed that oath, finde that it was an unlawfull oath, as obliging them to the acknowledgment of such a power in the Church, as is by no meanes allowed, in the word of God, they are in such a case onely obliged to be humbled for their rash sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription, &amp; taking of that oath, &amp; their second oath will hold valid against them]</hi> this is his first answer: And. 2. He say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>[suppose that the oath of canonicall obedience, was imposed without authority of Parliament &amp; the Parliament, as soon, as they took notice of it, declared their dissent to it, &amp; to all oathes imposed without their authority, certanely this should goe farrwith them who make the like plea against us, as to the obligation of the covenant.]</hi> This is his next answer, by which you may see; he looketh upon that oath of canonicall obedience, as peccant both in matter &amp; forme, &amp; that therefore it hath no force to annull the oath of the covenant, which were to no purpose if he looked not on that oath, as contradictory to the covenant. But then 3 he answereth <hi>[We will for once suppose the oath materially good &amp; lawfull, as to the efficient cause, yet certainly the oath is irritated &amp; made void by the Parliaments taking away of the matter thereof]</hi> Here he giveth, but granteth not, that the oath of canonicall obedience was lawfull, &amp; yet he asserteth that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding thereof, the covenant might have been sworne &amp; stood to, because the former oath was null, so soon ever as the matter of it was taken away by authority, &amp; that sayeth that
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:65203:73"/>
the matter of that oath standing viz prelay, &amp; prelats not taken away by authority, the swearing of obedience unto them is inconsistent with swearing to endeavour to extirpate them. It is true he addeth these words. <hi>Nor do we understand how any person, by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> promise or oath to be obedient in things lawfull &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, to this or that governement, doth oblige himself whatever evill he seeth in such a governour, either through want of just title, or male administration of his trust never to endeavour to free himself from that servitude.</hi> But thence it vvill not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily follow, that they who have sworne the covenant should not contradict the same if they shou'd now take the oath of canonicall obedience. Because, the oath to endeavour to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpat, includeth a not giving obedience unto them, as a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall includeth a particular, so that he who hath sworne to endeavour their extirpation, hath sworne withall never to obey them as lawfull governours: And so there is a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction betwixt the canonicall oath, &amp; the covenant. The Covenant bindeth up such as have taken it, from the canonicall oath, though the canonicall oath could not binde up their hands from the covenant, partly because it was sinfull upon the matter, &amp; unlawfull as to the power impose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: &amp; partly because though it had been lawfull both as to matter &amp; efficient cause yet the matter being taken away, the act about that object did cease. So sayeth <hi>Timorcus.</hi> But whether it be so, or otherwise, it is all one now to the purpose in hand; for the covenant being now taken, any such oath which had been un lawfull before becometh much more un law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full now; &amp; carryeth a contradiction to the covenant in its front.</p>
               <p>Thus thou seest what cause the precious &amp; worthy servants of Christ had to refuise obedience unto that act what ever suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing might follow thereupon, &amp; indeed sore were the sufferings which did follow, for on the first of <hi>Octob.</hi> there is an act of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell at <hi>Glasgow, prohibiting &amp; dischargeing all these ministers who had contraveened the foresaid act of parliament to exerce any part of the function of the ministery at their respective churches in

But yet they resolved to cast themselves on Gods providence, trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his word accounting it better to suffer affliction with the people of God, &amp; to enjoy peace of conscience; then to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season; and accordingly did remove themselves: By which meanes there were some hundereds of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes left destitute &amp; the shepherds were scattered up &amp; down the land, seeking a sheltering place for themselves. It was a sad &amp; lamentable sight to see the sad farewell betwixt the loving pastor &amp; his beloved floke, &amp; the teares, the cryes, and the bitter groanes that were there: Now were the breasts pulled from the mouthes of the young infants, the table was drawne, &amp; the people were made to wander up &amp; downe the mountaines seeking the word of the Lord, &amp; could not finde it, they had silent Sabbaths &amp; empty pulpites, some countrey sides were hereby laid utterly desolate: And what could these faithfull Ministers do in this case, but sigh, &amp; groan to God seeing they could not in conscience yeeld obedience unto these commands: &amp; therefore they resolved to be subject for conscience sake, and to submit unto the punishment of banishment out of the bounds of the presbytery where they lived (which was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward made more sad, for they were commanded to remove Twenty miles from their own parish Church, Six miles from a
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:65203:74"/>
a cathedrall, &amp; three or foure miles from a brugh) Now judge o reader whether this cruelty would not have more beseemed Turks, &amp; how little cause there was for all this severity &amp; rigour to Ministers, who had been endeavouring with some measure of faithfulnesse On their part, &amp; fruitfulnesse through the Lor'ds blessing on their labours, to enlarge the Kingdome of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> &amp; to build up poor souls in their most holy faith, because they would not give obedience unto such Acts as were but snares for the conscience; &amp; to which, obedience could not be yeelded, without sin.</p>

               <p>AFter that there were some other Ministers, whom the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Acts did not reach, removed out of some of the chief cities <hi>Brevi manu,</hi> without any processe; There are some wayes devised how moe of these might be removed with some colour or pretext, &amp; therefore some Six or Seven were called before the Parliament at their second session, and because they refused to take the oath which was tendered, they were sentenced with banishment by act of Parliament, &amp; ordained to remove off the Kingdome so soon as his Maj. commissioner should signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy his minde the reanent. But this sentence was not put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution possibly because they saw an inconsistencie betuixt this deed, &amp; an Act which they had made the former year in their first session, By which all such as refuised to take that oath, were to be <hi>uncapable of any publicke trust, &amp; to be looked upon as persones disaffected to his Maj, authority &amp; government,</hi> &amp; this was all. But in <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1662. The privy councell called some
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:65203:74"/>
other Ministers before them &amp; tendered the oath unto them &amp; because of their refuiseing of the same, they banished them out of all his Maj. dominions &amp; then gave them a bond to subscribe, wherein they did binde themselves to remove out of all his Maj. dominions within a moneth, &amp; not to returne under the paine of death, otherwayes they would commit them to close im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment, &amp; there keep them untill they had occasion, to send them elswhere. Whereupon these Ministers saw a necessity of subscribeing that bond of banishment; Though it was very hard to binde themselves to remove within so short a time, &amp; that in the midst of winter. But strange it is, that when the King himself, by his oath at his coronation is bound to rule the land, by the lawes, and constitutions received therein This his councell (which by the fundamentall lawes of the land (as appeareth by the 12 Act of the 2 parliam. of King <hi>Iames</hi> 4. whereby they are first established) is to give <hi>his high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness a true and essauld counsell in all matters concerning his Maj. and his realnie, and to be responsall and accusable to the King and his estates of their counsell,</hi> &amp; so is a judicatory subordinat unto the Parliament &amp; accountable to &amp; censur able by them) would banish such as the lawes of the land, did not account worthy of banishment: &amp; whether they would do right if they should punish with death such a fault as by the Established lawes of the land deserved only to be punished by a fine or a summe of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, let lawyers judge, &amp; whether this be not an arbitrary ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall power which they have assumed, any that considereth what is said, &amp; the act 27. of the 2.

               </p>
               <p>This is the oath of alleagiance &amp; how far it differeth from the former which was lately tendered, is easily discerned. These few words in the short oath <hi>[only supreme governour in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome over all persones, &amp; in all causes]</hi> containe the main dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt the two, &amp; the main grounds of scruple; for they hold forth two things. The King's supremacy in matters civill, &amp; his supremacy in matters ecclesiasticke.</p>
               <p>It is true Ministers ought both to be (&amp; to carry duti fully as becometh) subjects, &amp; to refuise nothing lawfull, which is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:65203:76"/>
required of subjects: but oathes, being matters about which much tendernesse &amp; carefulnesse ought to be used, it becometh Ministers to look well to this &amp; not to engadge in any oath rashly: Advisement &amp; deliberation is most requisite here, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in a time when snares abound, &amp; when there is good ground to suppose, that the oath is tendered of purpose to be a snare to the conscience.</p>
               <p>The oath as to it is substance, or maine thing intended, (which lyeth wrapped up in those few words last cited,) is not, (as is obvious to any) so clear as oaths ought to be; yea the imposers themselves will not deny this; but are forced to ack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowledge, that as it is worded, in respect of that part thereof, which is onely scrupled at, &amp; which containeth the substance &amp; maine thing intended, it is at best ambiguous, &amp; generall: &amp; for this cause (if there were no more) every Christian ought to forbear to swear the same: And that because, every oath must be sworne <hi>in truth, in judgment, &amp; in righteousnesse Ier.</hi> 4: 2. but an unclear &amp; ambiguous oath cannot be sworne in truth, because it hath no truth in it; for what is ambiguous is not true, as doctor. <hi>Sanderson</hi> sayeth <hi>de jur: promis: oblig. prael. 6. §. 10. a preposition of an ambiguous &amp; indefinite sense, before the matter be distinguished, is not a true proposition, yea nor a proposition at all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for a proposition, as its definition cleareth, should signify either a truth or a falshood, without any ambiguity</hi> And therefore this proposition that <hi>the King is onely supreme governous over all persones, &amp; in all causes</hi> being ambiguous till it be clared by some distinctions, cannot be sworne, in truth, because the truth thereof cannot be known: Nor can it be sworne in righteousnesse, because such as swear it cannot be sure but that in taking that oath, they may be wronging others, wronging Parliaments, &amp; which is worse, wronging the <hi>Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> who is King &amp; head of his Church. Nor can it be sworne in judgment, because its meaning cannot be known.</p>
               <p>But now seing the oath, in respect of its substantiall part as it is now worded is ambiguous &amp; unclear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> reason would require that the tenderers thereof should explaine the meaning thereof
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:65203:76"/>
&amp; make it as clear as may be: But when this is refuised what can such do who are pressed to take that oath; but refuise the same; partly because of its ambiguity, &amp; partly because, by the sense, which by their other Acts &amp; Actings, they who tender it, do put upon it, it appeareth to to be most unlawful: all divines &amp; casuists do grant that an oath must be taken in his sense &amp; meaning in whose favours &amp; for whose sake &amp; faifty it is conceived &amp; who tendereth it: And therefore it is not only lawfull but necessary to enquire what sense the Acts &amp; Actings of the Parliament, do put upon it.</p>

                     </gap>onds, &amp; exile by our nobles, far lesse were it necessary to confirme this deed of ours by forraigne examples, seing there are so many, so obvious in ancient histories. But now the nation of the Scots have been a free nation from the begining, &amp; have made Kings to themselves upon these conditions, that when necessity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired they might dethrone them, of which there are many footsteps remaineing fresh unto this day, for in the isles about &amp; in many places of the continent in which the old language &amp; lawes had any abode, this custome is followed in the choose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their governours, to this day: And the ceremonies used at the coronation of Kings, do clearly demonstrat that the government is nothing else but a mutuall stipulation betuixt King &amp; subjects as also the constant tenor of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient law by which Kings were inaugurated, which remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unchanged in the least, to this day: yea while so many of our, Kings have been banished, imprisoned, or more severely punished, there was never one motion made of relax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the rigour of the law; &amp; what wonder, seing it was not of
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:65203:79"/>
the nature of those lawes that change with tht time; but of those which are fixed in the heart of man by nature &amp; consent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto by all nations, &amp; which being subject to no other lawes, do command &amp; rule all, so that whether we will or not, they are before our eyes, what ever we be doing &amp; stick in our heart. This law did our predecessours follow being alwayes armed against violence, &amp; ready to suppresse tyrants But that I may passe in silence the famous cities of <hi>Athens La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedaemon, Rome</hi> &amp; <hi>Venice</hi> which keeped this law so long as they keeped their liberty: Yea even then when <hi>Rome</hi> was under tyrants if any good man became emperour he did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it his glory to acknowledg himself inferiour to the people &amp; subject to the lawes for when <hi>Trajanus</hi> gave a sword, according to the custome, unto the <hi>praefectus urbis,</hi> he said <hi>use it for me or against me, as I shall deserve:</hi> and <hi>Theodosius,</hi> a good emperour in these worst times would leave this noble saying among the lawes, that <hi>he confessed he was under the lawes.</hi> Neither was this law unknown to barbarous nations as all histories testify: But lest I should be thought to gather together examples now out of use I shall onely make mention of two later; the one is of <hi>Christieris</hi> the King of the <hi>Dennes</hi> who for his intollerable cruelty was put from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, he &amp; all his posterity; which is a sadder punishment then ever was inflicted by any of our progenitours—what did the mother of <hi>Charles</hi> the 5 that made her deserve perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall imprisonment—&amp; now what did we but following the examples of so many nations &amp; Kingdomes, suppresse tyranny, which swelled above all law, not indeed so severely as our predecessours did in like cases—for had we followed their example we had been farr from, not onely the fear of danger, but also, here calumnies.</q> Thus he, &amp; much more is added to this purpose there. More over this same Queen regent was told by the Earle of <hi>Ruthven,</hi> that same night that <hi>David Rizio</hi> was killed as <hi>Buch</hi> reporteth lib. 17. <hi>That the government of the Kings of Scotland was alwayes very lawfull &amp; that it was exerted not after the lisst &amp; pleasure of any one man, but according to the lawes, &amp; by the consent of the nobles, and if
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:65203:79"/>
any King did otherwayes he suffered accordingly, and now Scottish men are not so farr degenerated from the institutions of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessours as to suffer the tyranny and slavery of one who is a stranger and whom they look not upon as deserving any honest service.</hi>

Act. 2. the honour &amp; authority of the <hi>Supreme court of Parliament, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowed past all memory of men, is ratified,</hi> &amp; there it is said. <hi>That by the court of Parliament under God, the Kingdome hath been upholden, rebellious and traiterous subjects punished, the good and faithfull preserved and maintained, and the lawes and acts of Parliament (by which all good men are governed) are made and established—and therefore they statute and ordaine that none take up on hand to impugne the dignity and authority, of the estat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, or to seek or procure the innavation or diminution of their power or authority under the paine of treason.</hi> It is true that in the preceeding Act, they confirme the Kings <hi>Royall power and authority over all estates as well spiritual as temporal.</hi> And therefore their maintaining of the power and privilege of Parliaments is the more remarkable: And by the two Acts compared togethe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> it is aboundantly clear that the authority mentioned, in the first Act of that Parliament, which is granted to the king, is not over the <hi>Estat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of Parliament;</hi> but over <hi>private persones whether civill</hi> or <hi>ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastick:</hi> And so it is but a granting of him to be <hi>singulis ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor,</hi> which will easily be granted: And this will be more clear if it be considered what occasioned that Act, at that time. As was shown above in the first Section, the Lord was stirring up his servants to act something for the setling of the government of the Church, which occasioned the displeasure of many at court, &amp; when Ministers were freely rebuking sin in &amp; about the court, they were accounted railers &amp; traitours: And being accused of treason before the King &amp; his Councill, They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined them as incompetent Judges. Upon this account in this houre of darknesse by the meanes of the <hi>Earle of Arran.</hi> This Parliament is suddenly called (wherby there were two Parliaments in one year 1584. the one meeting <hi>May</hi> 22. &amp;
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:65203:80"/>
the other (which is called the ninth Parliament, as the former was called the eight) <hi>Agust</hi> 22.) which granteth this suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to the King over persones ecclesiastick &amp; (for formalities sake) civil, &amp; therefore in the end of that act, it is declared to be treason to decline his Maj. or his Council in any case. So then the question was not betwixt the <hi>King</hi> &amp; the <hi>Parliament:</hi> But betwixt the <hi>King</hi> or his <hi>Councel;</hi> &amp; the <hi>Church</hi> in spirituall matters: It is true also that in the 1. Act of Parliament 18. <hi>Anno</hi> 1606. <hi>[His Maj. soveraigne authority, Princely power, Royall prerogative, and privilege of his Crowne over all Estates, persones and causes whatsoever,]</hi> is acknowledged: But this act is of the same nature with the former, no prerogative over &amp; above the Estates of Parliament is acknowledged here to belong properly to the Crown: And moreover, these words are but faire flourishes &amp; parliamentary complements. Finally the prerogative here spoken of is founded upon personal qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions where with they say he was endued far beyond his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours such as, <hi>[extraordinary graces, most rare and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent vertues, singular judgment, for sight, Princely wisdome.]</hi> &amp; the like, &amp; these may be wanting in one possessing the crowne: &amp; therefore it could not be the minde of the Parliament to give a supremacy founded upon such qualifications, to these who had not those qualifications, &amp; so they could not annex it unto the Crowne.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Together with these particulars let this be considered. That in 3 Article of the league &amp; Covenant, they did all swear <hi>[Sincerly, really, and constantly, in their severall vocations to endeavour the preservation of the rights and privileges of the Parliaments;]</hi> And then it shall appear that there was good ground of scrupleing at that oath, which as explained by their acts tendeth to the overturning of those rights &amp; privileges: For none who desired to make conscience of the oath of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, might swear an oath so apparently opposite thereunto. It is true those questions concerning the power of Princes &amp; Parliaments are dark &amp; ticklish; &amp; Ministers, not being law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers by profession, can not be supposed to be well acquanted with the lawes, &amp; constitutions of the realme; or with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:65203:80"/>
&amp; extent of the same, in all points: Yet it concerneth them to see to this, that they run not themselves upon the rocks of contradictory oaths: And having sworne to endeavour in their places &amp; callings, the preservation of the rights &amp; privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of Parl. it concerneth them &amp; all not alitle to search so far into the rights &amp; privileges of Parl. as that they may know when an oath is tendered unto them which crosseth the same: &amp; being once engadged in an oath, in a matter not sinfull, not to change, or to swear that which destroyeth &amp; contradicteth the former oath. But leaving those things, &amp; not laying more weight on them, then they will bear, other particulars more weighty &amp; pressing must be spoken to: &amp; therefore let it be considered,</p>

               <p>Was there not then cause to scruple at the taking of this oath which would have imported a condemning of all those things? sure there was, as shall be showne in speaking to each of the particulars mentioned: Now it is clear that the taking of this oath, would have imported a condemning of all these particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, from this: That the Parliament doth condemne all these mentioned particulars (as the acts specified do clear) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause done without his Maj consent, which ought (say they) to have been had by vertue of his prerogative royall and supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, &amp; the perogative, doth explaine his supremacy in things civill, as shall be showne more fully hereafter.</p>
               <p>But to come to the particulars, <hi>first</hi> There was no ground for condemning <hi>that convention of Estates</hi> 1643. notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Kings consent was not had therto. 1.

Because in both those acts there is no mention made of any informality, which might justly either in law or conscience render these Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments null. Only there is mention made of their acts &amp; deeds but these cannot in any manner of way annull their constitution for a Parliament may be a Parliament legally conveened, though it should astablish iniquitie by a law: &amp; if the ground which they have laid down in these two acts 15 &amp; 9. for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annulling of these Parliaments hold good, indifferent men will soon see that they have anulled their own constitution, &amp; declared themselves no Parliament; for if their acts were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, with the acts of these Parliaments which they have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled, &amp; examined either by the rule of God's word (which all Christian commonwealths &amp; Parliaments should stir their course by) or by the fundamental lawes of the land, they would be found more worthy to be condemned.

So that there is no informality here at all discernable. If it be said that neither the King nor his commissioner was present at those Parl. &amp; so this informality annulled all Ans. 1. The want of this formality cannot be the cause of annulling these Parl. or Sessions of Parl. because they annull the very Session of Parliament 164<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

There is no law making the presence of the King or his Commissioner essential to every Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, far lesse, to every Session of a Parliament. 3. There have been many Parliaments holden in <hi>Scotland,</hi> without either king or Commissioner as in the dayes of King <hi>Iames 2. Anno</hi> 1437, &amp; 1438, &amp; 1440. where there is no mention made of the King in the Acts, as there is at the next Parliament 1443. but only of the <hi>[three Estates of Parliament concluding and ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:]</hi> So <hi>Anno</hi> 1560. there is a Parliament holden at <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> by the three Estates without either <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Queen</hi> &amp; an <hi>Act</hi> thereof ratified first Parliament King <hi>Iames 6.

when this Parl. did sit; &amp; yet the Parliament was keeped with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out her, as the Acts shew. So in the dayes of <hi>Queen Mary</hi> the Acts of Parl. run in the name of the <hi>Lord Governour &amp; three Estates of Parl.</hi> &amp; this Governour was not representing the <hi>Queen</hi> as her Commissioner; because when she was present, as <hi>Act 1.

So that this <hi>Stilus curiae</hi> being punctually observed to this day; consirmeth the observation concerning the fore men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned parl. viz. That they were holden without <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Queen,</hi> when neither <hi>King</hi> nor <hi>Queen</hi> is mentioned in the Acts. 3. Is it not strange how they could annull the parl. 1648. among the rest; seing the Acts of that parl. were more homogenious with their own Acts, then the Acts of the rest: For the Acts of, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe carryed on by, that parl. were no such injurious violation of his Maj. power &amp; authority; nor were they Acts of rebellion as they suppose the Acts of the other parl. to have been: So that the ground upon which they rescinde the rest of these Parl. will not warrand them to rescinde this; &amp; so it is not upon the ground of their Acts that they rescinde these parl.

It is yet more strange that this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament had so far forgot it self as to reckon up the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 1648. among the rest in the <hi>Act rescissory,</hi> when in their 9. <hi>Act,</hi> they had acknowledged it to have been a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, for there when they are approveing the Engadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the all &amp; onely bussinesse which that Parliament 1648. was carrying on, they stile them <hi>the estates of Parliament of this kingdome</hi> which is a title agrying to none but to lawfull Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Thus it is clear that there is no ground warranding a consent unto these Acts rescissory, but good ground to scruple at that oath, the taking whereof would have imported a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting unto the annuling of these Parliaments: considering 6. How King <hi>Charles</hi> the first, in the large treaty, in his answer to the first demand, sayeth that at the humble desire of his subjects he did call &amp; conveen a Parliament to beholden at <hi>Edinburgh, Iun.</hi> 2. 1640. so that this Parliament was lawfully convocated &amp; acknowledged to have been so by King <hi>Charles</hi> the first himself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly</hi> nor is there ground for assenting &amp; consenting unto <hi>the anulling of those Acts done and concluded in these Parliaments</hi> for 1. They are Acts made by Parliaments lawfully conveen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 2. They are Acts not repugnant to the word of God; but Acts made, for the carrying on &amp; advanceing of the work of reformation (except those made by the Parliament 1648) which every one according to his place &amp; power is sworne to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine &amp; promove, &amp; this the very vieuing of them will evince, how ever that whole work be now branded as rebellion &amp; sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: So that none could swear that oath as now tendered, &amp;

by Acts explained, but withall he must condemne the whole work of reformation, &amp; all Acts made for establishing of the same, in doctrine worshipe, discipline &amp; governement 3. did not King <hi>Charles</hi> 1 in the large treaty give this answere unto the first demand. <hi>That for as much as the King's Maj. at the humble desire of his subjects did call and conveen a Parliament to be holden at Edenbrugh Iun. 2. 1640. wherein certaine Acts were made, which Acts, his Maj. for the peace and good of this kingdome, is pleased to publish in his own name, with consent of the Estates, and therefore commands that the said Acts bearing date <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

His Maj. doth in the word of a king promise the publishing of the saids acts, in such sort as is above specified?</hi> And more over at that next Session of Parliament, <hi>Anno</hi> 1641. when himself was present all those Acts were approved &amp; ratifyed fully: &amp; did not King <hi>Charles</hi> 2, before &amp; at his coronation, ratify &amp; approve the Covenant, &amp; all Acts made in order to the carrying on of the ends of the Covenant? So that now they are full &amp; compleat lawes, wanting nothing, even of formality, which can be desired, seing he hath ratified &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved them all. 5. Are there not many of these Acts made by those Parliaments very much for the glory of God, &amp; the good of the countrey? did not themselves see this, when, for shames cause they were forced to make some Acts of the same nature, for curbing of vice, since they would not be said to renew them; so that it were hard to put Christians to condemne those Acts, &amp; laudable lawes 6. Is it not strange how they could condemne &amp; make null &amp; void all the Acts done by the committees &amp; Parliaments after 1648. seing by this meanes they shall condemne all the applications which were made unto his Maj. while he was in <hi>Holland,</hi> &amp; also they shall condemne the Kingdomes receiving of him, yea &amp; their crowning of him, both as null &amp; as done by a <hi>Non-Parliament?</hi> And thus they
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:65203:84"/>
will have the King no crowned King of <hi>Scotland;</hi> &amp; how deep this may draw let lawyers judge. It was never yet heard of that a King was crowned in <hi>Scotland</hi> but by a lawfull Parliament whose deed was valide; &amp; if this deed of that Parliament was not valid let wise men conjecture what the consequences will be. It is true they except in their Act 9. <hi>All such Acts as were passed in any meeting of Parliament or committee of Estates authorized by his Maj. presence.</hi> But his Maj. presence will not make every company of men a Parliament; yea his being present with them at any of their Sessions sayeth he owned them as a lawfull Parliament. 2. How ever, all these Acts which concerne himself (seing he was not present at their making) are null. 3. How comet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> it to passe that the Kings presence <hi>Anno</hi> 1641. did not availe to keep that session of Parliament from a stroke with the rest? And furder it appeareth that they annull the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament 1650, &amp; 1651. altogether, because if that had been a Parliament it had been the first Parliament of King <hi>Charles.</hi> 2; &amp; so the Parliament 1661. had been his second Parliament: But the Parliament 1661. is called his first Parliament, &amp; therefore there was never a lawfull Parliament before, in his reigne, &amp; thus by their principles he hath never been crowned in <hi>Scotland</hi> as yet: What a <hi>Premunire</hi> they fall into here, let lawyers judge?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly</hi> There was as little reason to condemne these <hi>meetings counsels &amp; conventions of the subjects</hi> at the begining of the late work: Because those meetings were necessary for the defence of Religion, against the bloody Prelates, who were seeking the overthrow &amp; destruction of all. 2. Nor is there any Act condemning such, which can with any colour be allaiged, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Act of that Parliament 1584. wherein things were carryed on by a strong faction in great haste, for they had five Sessions in three dayes; &amp; with great secrecy, for the Lords of the articles were sworne to secrecy; &amp; the doores<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But it will be replyed that this was with the consent of the supreme Magistrat. Ans. True, but the want of this consent will not make such aideing and supply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unlawfull, so long as the law of nature is to the fore, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeing every man to defend his neighbour: and are not <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> &amp; <hi>England</hi> near nieghbours, being in one Island, &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one King: Neither did they waite for the consent of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> supreme Magistrat when they helped them first against the French &amp; next against a faction of papists within their own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some: and therefore <hi>Scotland</hi> should not now waite for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of <hi>England's</hi> King, when they were to help them against a popish and prelaticall faction. Nor needed <hi>Scotland</hi> waite for the consent of their own supreme Magistrat, because as the law of nature doth oblige every one to defend himself by force of armes, against an army of bloody enemies, though the King should not consent (as shall be showne hereafter) so the law of nature will warrand any to defend their brother, though the King should not consent especially seing therby they are but defending themselves, against such an enemy as would next fall on them. 4.

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause. 1. There is no absolute necessitie for asking &amp; obtaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Kings consent, to the same; as if a Kingdom once sworne &amp; obliged in covenant with God, might not renew the same obligation, as oft as they thought fit. There is no such ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of having his Maj. expresse consent &amp; approbation, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the first making, or to the renewing of the same with God (as shall be more fully showne hereafter.) There is no law of God for this. 2. Nor is there any municipall law inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biteing the renewing of that covenant: Yea that warrand by which all the land took it at the first, viz the King's &amp; his councell's command to Ministers, to put their parishoners to take it, &amp; severall acts of Generall Assemblies, stand still in force: &amp; accordingly in each universitie, the Covenant was renewed yearly. 3. Moreover the <hi>Generall Assembly Anno</hi> 1639. en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned by ecclesiastical authority the subscription of the same; &amp; the Assembly presented a supplication unto the <hi>privie Councell</hi> desireing their ordinance for the subscription of the same, by all the subjects of the Kingdome, &amp; this was granted Agust. 30. &amp; <hi>Anno</hi> 1640. the <hi>parliament</hi> by their act 5. did ratifie the act of the <hi>Generall Assembly,</hi> their supplication, &amp; the act of Councill thereupon; which act of Parliament was approved by the King in the large treaty, &amp; thereafter by his personall presence at the next session of Parliament, where all was rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. So that this deed of renewing the <hi>Nationall Covenant</hi> wanted nothing, either in poynt of law or conscience to make it lawfull &amp; therefore it had been unlawfull to have taken such an oath, as would have imported the condemning of that deed.</p>

               <p>THere are other two Particulars (or rather one for they are much to one purpose) which virtually would have been condemned, by the taking of this oath thus explained, as to its civill part: viz <hi>Scotland</hi> their riseing in armes in their owne defence against the King's armies of papists &amp; malignants &amp; their seizing on the castles, which within their owne bosome were threatening their ruine when garisoned with adversaries.

                  <hi>Ninthly,</hi> There is no ground to condemne that <hi>defensive warre.</hi> Though much hath been said by court parasites, &amp; others; who were ambitious of gaine &amp; preferment, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggerat &amp; aggraige that supposed crime, &amp; thereby to make them &amp; their cause, odious to all the World; yet rationall &amp; indifferent persones will after serious pondering of a few particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, forbear to passe any rash sentence. Much hath been already said in the defence of that bussinesse, by the author of <hi>Lex Rex,</hi> &amp; more then ever could or will be answered. And therefore that book behoved to be answered by a fiery fagot: &amp; by <hi>Mr Prins soveraigne power of Parliaments, &amp;c.</hi> a book pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished by authority of Parliament &amp; never answered to this day: And therefore there will not be a necessity of insisting

much on it here, only a short hint at some particulars, will suffice.</p>
               <p n="1">1.

He speaketh of <hi>powers that are of God, &amp; are ordained of God,</hi> &amp; this agreeth to Inferiour Magistrats, who are God's Deputies, &amp; judge for him, as well as others, 2 <hi>Chron 19: v. 6, 7. Deut. 1: v. 16. Numb.</hi> 11: 16, 17.

He speaketh of such as are <hi>God's Ministers</hi> which is a generall word, comprehending all civill Governours. He speaketh of all such, <hi>to whom tribute, custome, honour, or fear is due;</hi> &amp; so he must take in all Magistrats, otherwise this text should not concerne commonwealths, which are ruled without a King. He speaketh of such as are <hi>revengers by office to execute wrath on them that do evill,</hi> &amp; thus <hi>are a terrour to evill doers, and a praise to such as do well:</hi> And this agreth to all Magistrats, &amp; therefore this place cannot be understood as speaking of any single person, or of <hi>Nero</hi> concerning whom it is a great question among lawyers, if, at this time, he had the heighest soveraigne power in the Roman State, as learned <hi>Prin</hi> sheweth in his <hi>soveraigne power of Parliaments,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>part. 3. pag,</hi> 109, 110, 111, &amp; 112. 2. Inferiour judges do judge for the Lord &amp; are deputed of him, &amp; therefore they are endued with power from him, for that effect, 2 <hi>Chron. 19: v. 6, 7. Deut.</hi> 1: 17. 3. Inferiour judges are commanded to rule well, &amp; they are threatened &amp; rebuked for mal-adminis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration:
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:65203:88"/>
See <hi>Ier. 5: v. 1. Isa. 1: 17, 21, &amp; 5: 7. &amp; 10: 2, &amp; 59: v. 14. Ier. 22: 3. Ezek 18: 8. Amos 5: 7. Micah 3: 9. Levit. 19: v. 15. Deut. 17: 11. Exod.</hi> 32: 2. Now would God command those inferiour Magistrats, to relieve the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, to judge the fatherlesse, to plead for the widow if they had not the power of the sword, for this effect, or would he challenge them, for neglecting this duty, if they had not been impowered by him, for that effect? doubtlesse not. So then if inferiour Magistrats be endued with power of the sword, they ought to defend the fatherlesse, the widow, &amp; the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed subjects, by the help of the sword, they ought to rescue them from the hands of their oppressours: And therefore when Popish malignant enemies rise up in armes, &amp; seek to destroy the Land, Man, Wife, &amp; Childe, the inferiour Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrats, much more the Parliament, may lawfully draw the sword, which God had given them, for the relief of the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, &amp; defence of the countrey, of their lives, lands, goods Religion, &amp; all that is dear to them, against malicious &amp; open enemies.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Buchanan,</hi> a man well acquainted with the lawes &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions of <hi>Scotland</hi> in his Book, <hi>De Iure Regni apud Scotos,</hi> sayeth that the Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> had no power of peace or warre without the Parliaments consent. So that a warre raised by the Parliament, against the common enemy, in defence of the Kings honour, the saifty of the people, &amp; the purity of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, cannot be condemned, as unjust &amp; illegall.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The renowned Historian <hi>Buchanan</hi> sheweth also that the Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> have been oftintimes resisted by armes, which a few instances will evidence, when <hi>Durstus</hi> the 11.

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:65203:88"/>
much evill: They routed his forces &amp; tooke himself prisoner. When <hi>Mogaldus</hi> grew odious by reason of his vices, they rose up in armes against him. So did they levy forces against <hi>Athirco:</hi> when <hi>Romach</hi> had become cruell and had put many to death, they rose in armes against him: when <hi>Ferquard</hi> 1. turned ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, he was summoned before a Parliament, &amp; when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuised to come, they levied forces against him, &amp; pursued him, they stormed his castle, in which he thought to shelter himself &amp; at length he was taken prisoner. So did they purpose to rise in armes against <hi>Ferquhard</hi> 2. If they had not been diverted. Likewise when King <hi>Iames</hi> the 3. had been seduced by his evill courteours, &amp; had plotted the murther of the nobles, they raised an army against him, &amp; at length killed him. So did the nobles take up armes against <hi>Bothwell</hi> &amp; the <hi>Queen</hi> &amp; pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued her untill she rendered herself prisoner. The nobles wrote unto the queen regent, <hi>Anno</hi> 1560. for removing of the french forces &amp; did adde (as <hi>Buchan.</hi> sayeth Lib. 17) <hi>Which tearmes if they be rejected we take God &amp; men to witnesse, that we take armes from no innate malice, or hatred; but sore against our wills are forced to assay the last remedy, least we should expose our selves, our fortunes, and our posterity, to the worste of colamities</hi> Hence it is clear that it was the common practice of the Parliaments of <hi>Scotland</hi> (and <hi>lex currit cum praxi)</hi> to rise in armes against their Kings, when they turned tyrants: And therefore, the Parliament their late taking up of armes in their own sinlesse self defence, can no wayes be condemned; let court sycophants speak what they please, to make that bussi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse odious, they both bewray their malice &amp; ignorance of the fundamental constitution of that kingdome.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Though, for all that is said, the Parliaments interest in warre should be questioned; yet their late defensive warre may be justified upon clear &amp; undenyable grounds, for there is no such connexion betwixt these two, but they are rather two distinct questions, naturall sinlesse, self defence, may belong to such, as have not propperly in stricke law, the power of warre.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The practice of other protestant princes &amp; Magistrats sheweth that their practice was not so odde nor odious, as men

(who have taught their tongues to speak lies) would make the world beleeve it was; for <hi>Sleidan</hi> lib. 8. &amp; 21. &amp; 22. &amp; <hi>Bilson</hi> out of him, in his <hi>difference,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>part. 3. pag.</hi> 274. sayeth that the <hi>German princes</hi> levied warre against the Emperour; viz. <hi>the Duke of Saxon</hi> the <hi>Landgrave</hi> of <hi>Hesse,</hi> &amp; the Magistrats of <hi>Magdeburgh</hi> together with other Princes &amp; cities, joyning in the warre who having had the advice &amp; resolution of lawyers after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture deliberation did conclude. <hi>That the lawes of the empire, permitted resistence of the Emperour in some cases: That the times were then so dangerous that the very force of conscience, &amp; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity did lead them to armes &amp; to make a league to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, though Caesar or any in his name, would make warr against them. and That if the Emporour had keeped his bonds &amp; cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants; they would have done their dutyes, but because he made the first breach the fault was his; For since he attempteth, to root out religion, &amp; subvert our liberties, he giveth us cause enough to resist him with a good conscience: The matter standing as it doth, we may (say they) resist, as may be shewed both by sacred &amp; prophane histories. Vnjust violence is not Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: Nether are we bound to him by any other reason, then if he keep the conditions on which he was created emperour.

prince of <hi>Condee</hi> with other princes, Peers, dukes, noblemen; &amp; officers of the crown conveening at <hi>Meziers,</hi> wrote to the <hi>Queen,</hi> compleaning of diverse grievances, &amp; wrongs, &amp; sought remedy &amp; redresse, by the assembly of the three est<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates, protesting that they desired nothing but peace and the good of the realme, &amp; that they would attempte nothing to the contrary, unlesse by the rash resolution of their enemies (who covered themselves with the cloak of state, under the <hi>Queen</hi> regents authority) they should be provoked to repell the injuries done unto the King &amp; state, by a naturall, just, and necessary defence: see the <hi>continuation of the life</hi> of <hi>Lewis</hi> the 13. <hi>pag.</hi> 59. &amp;c. So in the reigne of <hi>Charles</hi> 9 when all Acts of pacification were broken; after many fruitlesse petitions, and vaine promises, they take up armes, whereupon a bloody civill warre ensued: &amp; when this King contrary to his oath, <hi>An.</hi> 1572. caused that massacre at <hi>Paris,</hi> the protestants in <hi>Languedoc Rochel</hi> &amp; other parts, took up armes in their own defence. So when <hi>Henry</hi> the 3 came to the crown, the protestants saw a necessity of standing to their defence, &amp; being assaulted, they manfully defended themselves: &amp; againe, when the peace which was now concluded was broken by the instigation of the <hi>Catholick Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guers; The King</hi> of <hi>Navarre,</hi> the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Condee,</hi> the <hi>Marshall</hi> of <hi>Montmorancy</hi> &amp; others, resolved to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves whereupon followed a sixt civill warre which ended in a new peace, <hi>Anno</hi> 1580. So in the reigne of <hi>Lewis</hi> his son when the <hi>Queen</hi> mother who was then regent, would give no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse unto the protestants just grievances, The prince of <hi>Condee</hi> &amp; divers others raised forces in their owne defence, &amp; the duke of <hi>Rhoan</hi> &amp; other protestants did joyne with them: A peace was concluded <hi>Anno</hi> 1616. but the very next year the prince of <hi>Condee</hi> is seized upon, whereupon the princes meeting at <hi>Soyssons</hi> resolved to defend themselves by warre which continued <hi>Anno</hi> 1621, 1622. at last a peace was concluded but it lasted not long by cardinal Richelien's meanes. 3.

Sax. lib.</hi> 10. 10. They have the practice of the <hi>Sweds,</hi> riseing up in armes against <hi>Christierne</hi> the I. for breach of his Covenant made at his coronation, this was about the year 1499. See <hi>Chythraeus ubi supra.</hi> 11. They have the practice of the <hi>Helvetians:</hi> first three of their <hi>Cantons</hi> viz. The <hi>Sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, Vrjaus, &amp; Vndervaldians, Anno</hi> 1260. levied warre against their oppressing Nobles, &amp; did prosecute the same twelve years: &amp; <hi>Anno</hi> 1308. They joyne in Covenant to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themselves, against the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> &amp; defended themselves most resolutely, against the hudge armies of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries, &amp; upon the 16 of <hi>Nov.</hi> 1315. obtained a great vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, &amp; that same year they renewed their Covenant at <hi>Brun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na;</hi> in which Covenant, the other Ten <hi>Cantons,</hi> at severall times thereafter; being oppressed by their Nobles, did joyne, &amp; at length, by warre brought themselves into that state of liberty, in which they are at this day: See for all this <hi>Simle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus de Repub.

And thereafter in the dayes of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> they resolved to fight couragiously against all their enemies how great so ever they were.

Moreover Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> &amp; King <hi>Iames</hi> both, by the publick advice &amp; consent of their realmes, did give publick aid &amp; assistance unto the protestants of <hi>France</hi> against their King, &amp; to the <hi>Netherlands</hi> against the king of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and to the protestants in <hi>Germany &amp; Bohemia</hi> against the <hi>Emperour,</hi> &amp; entered into solemne leagues &amp; covenants with them: if they had been traitours, &amp; rebells, &amp; that acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of defence, utterly unlawfull, would those princes have joyned with them in this manner? who can think this? So did King <hi>Charles</hi> the first openly avow to aide the protestants in France at <hi>Ree</hi> &amp; <hi>Rotchell,</hi> against their King, who was come in armes against them: &amp; the <hi>Germane Princes</hi> against the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour:</hi> &amp; the <hi>Netherlands</hi> against the King of <hi>Spaine;</hi> And entered into a solemne league with them, for that end.

Some of their chief antagonists, are forced through the clearnesse of truth, to assert such things, &amp; grant such parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, as will by clear &amp; undenyable consequence justify their taking up of armes &amp; resisting the armies of their King, when they came against then to destroy Religion, Lives, Lawes, &amp; Liberties. (Beside that all of them are forced to speak most in consequently unto their own principles, &amp; by their conces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions do overthrow their own grounds, &amp; arguments as might easily be made to appear if to discourse at length of this subject were designed now.) As 1. <hi>Iohn Barclay, Lib. 4.

Yea when he alloweth in such a case that hands may be laid upon the prince, he more then justifieth them, who never did intend harme to his Maj. person, &amp; honour; but wished &amp; sought the saifty &amp; preservation thereof, by all meanes. And againe when he would answere the argument taken from Elisha's resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting of the King, he granteth <hi>[that itis lawfull to resist the Kings cutthroats]</hi> and what did <hi>Scotland</hi> more then resist his bloody emissaries? Moreover he alloweth <hi>[to privat persones liberty to deny subsidies and tribute to the prince when he imployeth it to the destruction of the common wealth]</hi> and is not this a clear resistance &amp; a taking of the sword out of his hand? But what shall a nation do that cannot get pay holden from a plundering army of enemies, &amp; so cannot get them disbanded, but take up armes &amp; force then to it?

And elsewhere in that book viz, lib. 1. c. 10, &amp; lib. 5. c. 5. he alloweth subjects to resist &amp; to depose Kings in some cases: which is more then Scotland doth desire. 4. <hi>Arnisaeus de author prinp.</hi> c. 2: n, 10. granteth <hi>[that if the prince proceed extrajudicialiter, without order of law by violence every private man hath power to resist]</hi> much more then may the body &amp; representative of a land resist, when he cometh against them with fire &amp; sword, which is the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trajudiciall acting imaginable.

He furder proveth it from that passage which was cited out of <hi>Barclaius.</hi> yea he dar not condemne any, no not the lesser part of the people who rise in armes, in extreme necessity, far lesse would he condemne the body of a land useing this last remedie in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of hazard &amp; danger, furder he proveth this from David who took armed men 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 22: 2. &amp;. 23: 13. to resist the violence of <hi>Saul</hi> after he had learned for certanety that he was seeking his life: and from the <hi>Maccabces</hi> whom (as he thinketh) nothing else can defend but the great &amp; imminent danger in which they were.

There is great difference to be put, betwixt actuall diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying of, rebelling against, &amp; violently with force of armes resisting, the lawfull Magistrat, doing his duty, &amp; command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing just things warranded by the lawes of God, &amp; the land: And disobeying his unjust Acts, &amp; resisting his violent, tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall, oppressing, plundering, spoiling &amp; killing armies. The former is a resisting of the very ordinance of God, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. where the Apostle is speaking of the civill Magistrat doing his duty, &amp; in his place, as God's deputy, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erceing the duties of his calling, &amp; executing his office. But in the other case, the Magistrat is out of his function &amp; calling; for God giveth no command to do evill, nor to tyrannize. He is not God's vicegerent when he playeth the tyrant; &amp; therefore he may be resisted &amp; opposed, without any violence done to the office or ordinance of God. As the King's messinger may be resisted &amp; withstood when he crosseth his commission &amp; war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand, without any wrong done to the office or to the King. Every disobedience in things sinfull is not a resisting of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God. The office may be owned, &amp; the person in the office honoured, &amp; esteemed, as he ought, when yet his
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:65203:94"/>
unjust violence may be resisted, &amp; his sinfull commands disobey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for it is onely powers that are ordained of God that must not be resisted, &amp; tyrants, or Magistrats turning tyrants, and exerceing tyranny, cannot be called the ordinance of God; though the office abstracted from the tyranny, be the ordinance of God: And there is no hazard of damnation, for refuseing to obey unjust lawes, but rather hazard of damnation, in wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly following after the command: And so there is no danger in resisting such Acts of tyranny; for tyrants exerceing tyranny, are no terrour to evil doers: But on the contrary they are a terrour to good works, &amp; therefore that place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be understood of tyrants. It is a true &amp; a worthy saying of famous <hi>Mr Knox in</hi> his history of <hi>So<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>land Lib.</hi> 2. pag. 141. <hi>There is a great difference betwixt the authority which is Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance &amp; the persons of those, who are placed in authority. The authority &amp; God's ordinance can never do wrong; but the corrupt person placed in authority, may offend; So that the King as king is one thing, &amp; the king Acting tyranny is another thing.</hi> They plead not for rebelling against the office, or resisting that, which is God's ordinance. They did never intend to destroy Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracy, or to lessen the Kings Maj. just power &amp; lawfull autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or to wrong the office in the least. And therefore all the arguments of their adversaries taken from <hi>Rom,</hi> 13. or the like places, which speak against withstanding &amp; opposeing of the office, &amp; divine appoyntment of God, are of no force, against them, &amp; their cause. Tyranny is one thing, &amp; the office of the King is another thing: And what arguments speak well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst resisting the office, or the person duely, &amp; legally dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chargeing the duties belonging to that office, will not conclude against resisting of tyranny. So that all the arguments taken from <hi>Numb. 16. Exod. 22: 28. Eccles.</hi> 10: 20. &amp;. 8: 2, 3, 4 <hi>Prov.</hi> 17: 26. And the like places, do not speak home to their case.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is also a great difference betwixt riseing up in armes without any just lawfull ground, or for trissles, or matters of small moment, as for the exacting of some more tribute then is due by the law, or the like, &amp; riseing up in armes in extreme
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:65203:94"/>
necessity, when religion, lawes, lives, &amp; liberties, &amp; all that was dear to them as men, &amp; as christians were in hazard, and this was their case, for the king came with an army upon them, &amp; blocked them up both by sea &amp; land, &amp; thus, with forraig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, was seeking to subdue them, &amp; so to overturne religion, lawes, liberties &amp; all, was not this extream necessity? What more imminent danger could be expected then an army of bloody papists bent to prosecute their bloody designes coming with fire &amp; sword, encouraged by a commission from the king &amp; so approaching their very borders? Was there not then a necessity, an extreme &amp; inevitable necessity, to rise up in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, for the saiftie of religion, lawes, lives, &amp; liberties, when all was thus in most imminent danger? Should the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment &amp; the whole body of the land give up unto the lust of these bloody irish, popish, prelaticall &amp; malignant enemies, their own lives, &amp; the lives of their wives &amp; children, their liberties as men, &amp; as christians? Should they sell religion &amp; the land, their soulls, &amp; their consciences unto those men because (for sooth) they had a commission from the King? there is no reason in the world for this. Therefore seing there is nothing more dear to people then their religion, their lives, &amp; their liberties, a warre raised in the defence of these, cannot be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a warre raised upon trissles, or sedition, faction, or mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny; but a necessary defensive warre, not raised upon privat injuries &amp; discontents, But upon matters of the greatest impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance &amp; necessity, viz to prevent the extirpation of religion, the subversion of lawes, &amp; liberties, &amp; the destruction of lives &amp; all <hi>Cicero de officis lib.</hi> 2. can tell us that <hi>omnium societatum nulla est gratior mella carior quam ea quae cum republica est nui cui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que nosirum; cari sunt parentes, cariliberi, propi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p n="3">3. There is also a difference betuixt a war raised of purpose to force the supreme Magistrat to be of the same religion with the subject, or else to dethrone him; and a war raised to defend that religion, which both Magistrat &amp; subject owneth. Betuixt a war raised in defence of that religion which hath never been
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:65203:95"/>
established by the lawes of the land; and a war raised in defence of that religion, which is publickly owned by the lawes of the land &amp; which King &amp; subject both, are sworne to maintaine, &amp; which by the lawes, becometh a civill right &amp; a part of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill liberty of the subject. Whatever may by said against a war raised in the former case; yet in this last case a war defensive is most warrantable, and this was the very case of <hi>Scotland;</hi> for they were seeking to defend the religion, which was establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the lawes of the land, &amp; which popish &amp; prelaticall mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnants, were seeking to overturn; So that any argument, which adversaries can bring from the practice of the primitive christians, will conclude nothing against them; because the true religion was not then established by law, the emperours had never consented therunto, but it was otherwise in <hi>Scotland</hi> as hath been abundantly shown <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. &amp; 2.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is also a difference betuixt a violent laying of hands upon the person of the King, of purpose to destroy, &amp; cut him off, or to denude him of his just power &amp; privilege, &amp; that in cold blood too, by privat persons, for some personall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries: This they abhore &amp; ever have abhored: and betuixt a sinlesse self defence when unjustly assaulted by armies sent by the King, to destroy &amp; cut them off. In pleading for a sinlesse self defence, they do not plead for an illegall taking away of the life of a King. Their raising of forces in their own sinlesse self defence cannot be condemned; there being an actuall inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion made upon their lives &amp; liberties which made their war to be <hi>[tutela vitae proxima] the last refuge for the life,</hi> &amp; the only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie that was left for the saifty of religion, &amp; of all that was dear unto them. So then their case not being a prosecution of adesigne of some privat persons upon some privat injuries received, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy' &amp; cut off the King, or to denude him of his just power &amp; pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege; but a nationall defence of religion, lives, &amp; liberties, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Kings armies unjustly seeking to destroy &amp; violently to overturne all; None of the arguments of adversaries ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from. 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 24: 6, 10. &amp; 26: 9, 11, 23. 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 1: 12, 16. do conclude against them, or speake to their case.</p>
               <p n="5">5. There is also a great difference betwixt a warre contrived
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:65203:95"/>
&amp; carryed on, by privat persons when grievously oppressed: And a warre carryed on, by the body of a land in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentatives in Parliament, against a king. Suppose, the first could not well be defended (which yet is not absolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed) yet this last is clear; for a Parliament hath more power over a king then any privat person, or subject how great so ever, hath: judicious <hi>Calvin</hi> is clear for this in his <hi>institutions lib. 4. cap.</hi> 20, n, 39. saying <hi>if there be inferiour Magistrats, such as the</hi> Ephori <hi>among the</hi> Lacedaemonians; Tribuns <hi>among the</hi> Romans <hi>The</hi> demarchi; <hi>among the</hi> Athenians, <hi>and as the</hi> Estates of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament <hi>in kingdomes now, if these connive at the king's oppressing of the people they become persidious because they betray the peoples li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, which by God's appoyntment they are to protect.</hi> Thus <hi>Scotland</hi> is cleared, for their warre was carryed on by the body of the land in their representatives, by their Parliament, acting in its publick &amp; parliamentary capacity: and so the arguments drawn by adversaries from the practice of the primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, speak nothing against the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> Their levying warre against the king in their own defence, &amp; in the defence of the liberties &amp; lawes of the land.</p>
               <p n="6">6. There is a difference betwixt a warre raised by a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of purpose to cut off the king, &amp; to depose him from his throne &amp; governement (which hath been severall times pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised by the Parliaments of Scotland, when their kings turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed tyrants &amp; vitious in their lives, as was showne above) &amp; their case, which was a case of pure defence, there being no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to offer the least violence to his Maj. person, crowne or dignity: but only to defend religion, &amp; the kingdome, against the popish &amp; malignant, invading, plundering forces, which were sent forth to destroy all: for their armies advanced with petitions seeking redresses of wrongs with all humility, &amp; shewing their willingnesse &amp; readinesse to lay down armes so soon as they were secured in the peaceable enjoyment of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion sworne to, &amp; freed from the just fears of these bloody in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading forces who were seeking the destruction of their lives &amp; liberties. So then when their adversaries reason against riseing in armes against the King they speak not to the poynt; none of
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:65203:96"/>
these arguments come near to their case which was a case of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall sinlesse self defence.</p>
               <p n="7">7. It would be considered that the warre did not begin upon the Parliaments side; but they were forced &amp; constrained to it: The King commanded all the English Nobility, with all their power &amp; forces to meet him at <hi>York April</hi> 1639. that they might advance with him towards <hi>Scotland.</hi> The Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish Noble Men who were at court, were also sent down to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Scotland</hi> to raise their friends, having some expert for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Officers with them: There were three thousand Men sent down with the navy, &amp; six hundered Horsemen were sent down to the Borderes to make incursions, all which prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of warre did clearly speak out his Maj. intention, &amp; did necessitate them to bestir themselves in their own defence; against those invaders, &amp; to keep their own rights unviolated: And yet with all they had their supplications ready to presente, after the granting of which, viz. a quyet &amp; peacable enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Religion, Lives, Lawes, &amp; Liberties, they resolved to lay down armes &amp; accordingly did so; for after the pacification, <hi>Iun.</hi> 18. 1639. their army was disbanded. Againe when the Parliament which was convocated by his Maj. command conforme to the pacification, was, contrary to the articles, &amp; contrary to the liberties of the land, &amp; privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of the Parliament, prorogued; the Castles of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> &amp; <hi>Dumbritton,</hi> were fortified with men &amp; ammunition; Theis friends <hi>travelling</hi> to <hi>England</hi> &amp; <hi>Irland</hi> were constrained to swear unlawfull oaths; or to góe to prisons; The sea was stopped; &amp; no liberty was granted to trassique, &amp; so the land was block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up; The articles of pacification were broken; <hi>Berwick</hi> and <hi>Carlile,</hi> were fortified; The Commissioners who were sent from the Parliament to the King, were imprisoned, contrary to the law of Nations; The Castle of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> was killing many, &amp; threatening to destroy the whole city with their can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non; their ships were intecepted by sea, &amp; their merchands spoiled of their goods, sea men were taken prisoners &amp; miser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably handled: When matters went thus, were they not cons<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trained to take up armes againe, &amp; to advance towards <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:65203:96"/>
that they might seek peace, from his Maj. not being able to maintaine an army on the borders, after they had been so impoverished, through the long want of fine tradeing, and not to lay downe armes, untill their necessary and just desires were granted? Now let any judge, whether they can be justly blamed for standing to their defence, being thus necessitated as they would not betray the Land, their Lawes, their Liberties, &amp; their Religion, &amp; so sell their soul &amp; consciences &amp; all into the hands of their malitious enemies?</p>
               <p>So then, when this shall be made the state of the question whether or not the Parliament, &amp; body of the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland,</hi> may not lawfully take up armes (having no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to wronge his Maj. person, or to spoile him of his just rights &amp; privileges) to defend themselves, Lands, Liberties &amp; (no lesse then) their Religion after it had been setled by law: When the King (in stead of granting their just &amp; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary desires viz. security, that they should be ruled by lawfull generall Assemblies, &amp; other inferiour Church judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catories in Church matters, according to the ancient disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the Church: And by a free Parliament in civill mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, according to the foundamentall lawes of the Land; And that they might be free from illegall courts &amp; alteration in their Religion: &amp; that the articles of agreement should be keeped &amp; that granted which was promised under hand &amp; seal) is raising a strong army of forraigners, <hi>Irish, Popish,</hi> prelaticall, &amp; malignant enemies to the Church &amp; kingdome of <hi>Scotland</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to destroy their Land, Liyes, &amp; liberties, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn their Religion, &amp; Privileges; &amp; for this end blocketh them up by sea &amp; Land, fortifyeth Castles in their bosome, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them commission to destroy all they could &amp; denunceth them all rebells &amp; treatours? Sure it may be supposed that, seing this is the true state of the question it shall easily be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that this was a necessary defensive warre, &amp; that <hi>Scotland</hi> could do no lesse then they did, unlesse they would have wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly betrayed their Religion &amp; all which they had as men,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:65203:97"/>
or as Christians, into the hands of their bloody &amp; cruell adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries, which no law would have warranded them to do.</p>
               <p>But to put a close to this. This their practice is abundantly warranted.</p>

               <p n="2">2. By the concessions of adversaries; for they grant that it is lawfull to flee from the tyranny of abused authority, as <hi>Moses</hi> did <hi>Exod. 2. David, 2 Sam. 19. Elisha, 1 King. 19. Ioseph &amp; Christ, Mat.</hi> 2. &amp; this Christ warranteth expresly <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. Now this flying is a plaine resisting of rulers, &amp; if resisting be unlawful, this must be unlawfull likewise, &amp; if this be not unlawfull, resisting cannot be unlawfull: for the the same justice &amp; equity which warrandeth men by flight to decline unjust assaults, doth also warrand an escapeing of them by resistence, when flight will not do it: (Which was indeed the case of <hi>Scotland,</hi> for it is not imaginable, how a whole
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:65203:97"/>
land, man, wife, &amp; child, old &amp; young, sick, &amp; whole, can flee from their habitations &amp; goe seek their livelyhoods in other Kingdomes; beside, that it is a great question, if the States of a land, the peers &amp; inferiour judges, were bound, by flying to leave the Land, Liberties &amp; all, unto their enemies, if they had power to defend themselves) for if the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture oblige men to preserve themselves by flight from tyranny it doth also oblige them to defend themselves by resisting, when they cannot conveniently secure themselves by flight; o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> when they cannot flee without betraying of the countrey, Religion &amp; all. All this will be so much the clearer if it be considered that if a tyrant hath legall power from God to kill, he hath the same legall power to summon legally, &amp; siste before his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunall, such &amp; such persons: And therefore if it be unlawfull to resist his tyrannous murthers, it must be also unlawfull to resist his legall citations to that effect, &amp; so unlawfull to flee; for one &amp; the same power citeth &amp; judgeth: Therefore if the law of defence warrand one to resist his summonds, &amp; not to compeer it warrandeth one to resist his tyranny, if he can be able; It is true the one resistence is more, but <hi>majus &amp; minus non variant speciem:</hi> And if the one be a fault in conscience, so must the other be: See <hi>Lex Rex, Pag.</hi> 325, 326. Next, they grant that it is lawfull for subjects to resist a forraigne ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, invadeing the land with armes; &amp; thus their practice is justified. It is true their enemies had the Kings Commission; but the having or wanting of such a commission, will not alter the case of the land, which is put to defend it self: For whether these enemies have such a commission or not, they are strangers &amp; forraigne enemies to the land, &amp; they come with a hostile minde to destroy, &amp; to conquere the same; &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what ever commission they have, the people are bound to defend themselves, their Families, young &amp; old, their Lands, their Liberties, &amp; their Religion, &amp; all which they have.

There are two kindes of contending, one by argueing which is propper to men, the other by force, which is propper to beasts, we must flee to this last when we cannot make use of the former] &amp; againe in his <hi>Orat. pro Milone</hi> he sayeth, <hi>Est haec non scripta,</hi> &amp;c. <q>[This law is not a law written, but a law borne with us, we have not learned it, nor acquired it', nor read it, but we have taken it, drawne it, &amp; extracted it from nature it self, to which we are not taught but made, we are not instructed but are endued with it, that if our life be in hazard by snares, by violence, &amp; darts of thieves or ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies all honest wayes must be assayed to free our life.

               <p n="6">6. By right reason: for there is no striker obligation betuixt a prince &amp; his subjects then betuixt parents &amp; children, yea not so stricke; &amp; yet if the father become distracted &amp; rise up in a fury to kill his children, the children may lawfull joyn together &amp; resist him, &amp; binde his hands; So may the wife resist the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just violence of her unnaturall husband, much more may sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects resist the unjust violence of their King. 2. Otherwise a King who was an ordinance of God ordained for a rich blessing; should become the greatest curse imaginable, if <hi>actu primo</hi> he be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested of God with power to tyrannize; &amp; the people be put out of all capacity to resist, he should become the greatest of curses to a people. 3. This should crosse the end for which people did set up a King over themselves; it was to preserve them, &amp; to keep them from wrongs &amp; not to put power in his hand to kill &amp; murther them as he pleaseth. 4. This would put ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall creatures into a worse condition then the beasts are into for if their King will, he may cut all their throats, destroy all their liberties, ravish all their wives, &amp; doughters, destroy all their lands &amp; livings, &amp; that without any controle or the least resistence imaginable. But who can beleeve this? Yea put the case there were but three or foure Kings in all the world
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:65203:100"/>
all the lives of the rest should be at their devotion; so that if they in a fit of fury &amp; madnesse give out the word of command, they may cause kill all, without any resistence: &amp; would not this reflect upon the wisdome &amp; godnesse of God, if he ordered mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters so? but the absurditie of this is abundantly clear so that more needeth not be said.

               <p>Thus in some measure is this <hi>Ninth</hi> particular cleared &amp; the Iawfulnesse of Scotland's defensive warre clearly showne, &amp; hereby the unlawfulnesse of swearing any oath, which might have imported a condemning of that warre, is also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated.</p>
               <p>By what hath been said to this <hi>Ninth</hi> particular, the <hi>Tenth</hi> &amp; last is likewise cleared viz. <hi>The lawfulnesse of Scotland their seizing upon the Castles within themselves:</hi> For if it be lawfull for a land to defend themselves; &amp; to use resistence by armes, in their own necessary defence; It is also lawfull for them to seize upon such castles &amp; strengths, as may prove a fit &amp; neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary meane of defence. It is lawfull to possesse these, &amp; keep them out against the enemies of the countrey, who if they had them, would make use of them for the destruction of the land &amp; for the subversion of Religion, Lives, &amp; liberties: What ever law will allow of self defence, will also allow the use of all fit meanes for that end; For the end includeth the meanes leading to the end. Moreover these Castles &amp; Fortifications were originally appointed for the saifty &amp; security of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, &amp; of none else, &amp; therefore at the learge treaty, it is concluded in answer to the second demand; <hi>[That the Castle of
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:65203:100"/>
Edinburgh and other strengths of the Kingdome should with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Estates of the Parliament, according to their first fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, be fournished and used for defence and security of the Kingdom.]</hi> So that hereby the King approved of all which was done in this businesse, before: &amp; acknowledged that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their first fundation they were for the Kingdom's advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. It is true, these Castles were annexed to the Crown <hi>Parl. 11. Act 41. King Iames 11.</hi> but that was done <hi>to guaird against the poverty of the real me,</hi> &amp; for all that <hi>the King might not give them away in fee or heritage, nor in franck tenement without the advice, deliverance &amp; decreet, of the whole Parliament: And for great, soon, &amp; reasonable causes of the realme, otherwise any alienation or disposition was to be of no avail;</hi> And it was enacted that the Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> should be sworne at their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation to keep his statute in all points: &amp; <hi>Act 9. Parl. 9. king Iam. 6.</hi> sayeth that <hi>[These Castles are for the welfare of the realme, as well as for his Maj. behoofe: so Act. 125. Parl. 7. K. Iam. 6.</hi> The Castles are called, <hi>the keyes of the realme.</hi> So though the King hath the custody &amp; command of them, yet it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in order to the right end, that is, for the saifty &amp; good of the countrey, &amp; if he should make use of them, for the ruine &amp; destruction of the countrey, they should be abused, &amp; might lawfully be taken out of his hand &amp; converted to the right use, as when a father turning mad will kill his children with a sword, the children may lawfully take the sword from him with which, he was bound to defend them, against the common enemy, &amp; make use of it in their own defence. Castles &amp; fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations are not the King's patrimony, but belong to him as King &amp; Governour of the land, so that he is to make no use of them, but for the countreyes good, he cannot dispone &amp; sell them as he may do other things, that belong to his patrimony: Therefore <hi>Scotl.</hi> cannot be blamed, for seizing on these for their own saifty, seing this is their native end, &amp; the only thing they were ordained for. Nor can any be blamed for refuseing that oath which would have imported a condemning of this lawfull &amp; necessary deed.</p>
               <p>Thus reader thou hast shortly laid before thee a hint of what
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:65203:101"/>
clear grounds there were, of stumbling at the taking of this oath as to the very civil part thereof, seing this civil supremacy is &amp; must be the same with his perogative &amp; his prerogative is such as hath been showne. A difference betuixt the supremacy &amp; the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative is not imaginable, unlesse it be this. that the supremacy is more comprehensive, &amp; taketh in all the prerogative &amp; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more: yea by some posteriour acts, they are made of one &amp; the same latitude, as in the <hi>act</hi> for <hi>the national Synod,</hi> the setling of the external government of the church is said to belong to his Maj. as an inherent right of the crown. &amp; how? <hi>by vertue of his prerogative royall and supreme authority:</hi> so that, his prerogative royall &amp; supreme authority are made one: &amp; if they be one as to ecclesiastical matters much more must they be one &amp; the same, as to civill matters: &amp; more clearly in the King's commission for the <hi>heigh commission,</hi> where it is said <hi>His Maj. by vertue of his royall prerogative in all causes and over all persons etc:</hi> so that any may see that his <hi>supremacy over all causes</hi> is one &amp; the same thing with his <hi>prerogative.</hi> Moreover this is certane that who soever do acknowledge &amp; recognosce the <hi>King's power &amp; supremacy, in all causes, and over all persons,</hi> do acknowledge &amp; recognosce all that which they say agreeth to him as King, and who soever do acknowledge &amp; recognosce this, do acknowledge &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognosce his <hi>royall prerogatives:</hi> for his <hi>royall prerogatives</hi> are such things, as agree to him as King, because they are annexed to the crown, as they say. It is true in their 11 <hi>act</hi> of <hi>parl:</hi> the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of his Maj. prerogative is mentioned beside the oath of alleagiance: But that will nor make them to differ so far; yea the acknowledgment of his Maj. prerogative is but explicatory of a part of that supremacy mentioned in the oath of alleagiance. So that his prerogative over parliaments &amp; over their actions &amp; over all other subjects, is but a part of that supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy which they say he hath over all persons &amp; in all causes. So in the oath for asserting his <hi>majesties prerogative,</hi> defensive armes &amp; the Kingdomes entering in a league with <hi>England</hi> &amp; all their proceedings in the work of reformation are condemned, &amp; this cannot be denyed, though there be an expresse oath afterward conceived of purpose for that end, viz the <hi>declaration</hi> set forth. <hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>The meaning of the oath of Alleagiance as to its ecclesiastick part opened, &amp; some reasons why upon that account it could not be taken.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe civil part of this oath of alleagiance being thus spoken to, in the next place the ecclesiastick part must be handled; &amp; when this is but explained, reasons without much difficulty will appear, why as to that part of it, it could not then, (nor as yet can) in conscience be subscribed unto.</p>
               <p>In this part, as in the other, the sense which the tenderers thereof do put upon it, must be searched &amp; sought for, out of their acts: for though it could have been wished (&amp; both reason &amp; religion would have required it) that after the example of <hi>Abraham,</hi> they had made the oath as plaine &amp; easie as might be, so that the sense &amp; meaning of it had been obvious to all; or had annexed such a glosse &amp; meaneing, as the words in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary construction would bear, &amp; tender Christians might saifly assent unto: yet there was no such thing done: yea not being desired to do it, would they do it: yea nor would they suffer any to enquire at them, in what sense they would have the oath taken: yea which is more, they made an act dischargeing all to offer any sense of the oath under the paine of treason. So that there is no way now left to finde out the meaning of the oath as to this part but by their acts &amp; actings, which, when considered, together with some other things usefull in this bussinesse, will help to cleare the true sense thereof. Three things then must be spoken to. 1. The rise &amp; progresse of this bussinesse, which is imported by this part of the oath, viz, the Kings supremacy over persons ecclesiastick, &amp; in ecclesiastick causes, in <hi>England.</hi> 2. The rise &amp; progresse of it in <hi>Scotland</hi> 3. Some acts &amp; deeds of the King &amp; Parliament who now ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it.</p>

As to the first of these. It is notour enough what King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight did, when upon some privat discontents he shook off the <hi>Pop's</hi> supremacy <hi>Anno</hi> 1530. for having caught the Clergy in a <hi>Premunire,</hi> for countenanceing some way or other the <hi>Pop's</hi> legat, he would not be satisfied with their pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of 100000. lib: unlesse also they would acknowledge him, for the supreme head of the Church on earth, which after some debate in their Synod both in the upper &amp; lower house of convocation, was condescended to, in forme as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth <hi>cujus, &amp;c. of which Church.</hi> (viz the Church of <hi>England) we recognosce his Maj. to be the singular protectour, the only &amp; supreme Lord: &amp; (so far as Christ's lawes will permitt) the supreme head.)</hi> This was subscribed unto by all, &amp; put into their publicke acts or instruments, &amp; presented to the King: afterward <hi>Parl.</hi> 24. c. 12. upon this ground it was sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted &amp; ordained that all ecclesiasticall suites &amp; controversies, should be determined within the Kingdom, &amp; all appeals to <hi>Rome</hi> were prohibited: and <hi>Parl.</hi> 25. c. 20. The manner of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of <hi>Archbishops</hi> &amp; <hi>Bishops</hi> was altered, &amp; that power given &amp; granted to the King, and upon this same foundation. <hi>Parl.</hi> 26. c. 1. it was declared that the King is supreme head of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> &amp; that he should have all honours &amp; preheminences which were annexed unto that title: &amp; after this there followed another act. c. 3. for Tenths &amp; first fruits as appertaineing to that head-shipe &amp; supreme authority. Hence also <hi>Anno</hi> 1532. The convocation submitting unto the King's Maj. promiseth in <hi>verbo sacerdotis [That they would never from thence forth presume, to attempt, allaidge, clame or put in ure, enact, promulge, or execute, any new canons, constitutions, ordinances, provinciall or others or by whatsoever name, they shall be called, in the convocation unlesse the Kings most royall assent may to them be had, to make promulge &amp; execute the same, &amp; that his Maj. do give his most royall assent &amp; authority in that behalfe.]</hi> Which deed of theirs the Parliament did, shortly thereafter, ratifie in these termes <hi>[That none of the said clergy from thence forth should presume to allaidge, clame, or put in ure, any constitutions, or ordinances, provinciall or synodall or any other
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:65203:102"/>
canons nor should enact promulge, or execute any such canons, constitutions or ordinances (by whatsoever name or names they may be called) in their convocations, in time coming (which alwayes shall be assembled by the Kings write) unlesse the same clergy may have the kings most royall assent &amp; license, to make promulge &amp; execute such canons constitutions, &amp; ordinances provinicall &amp; sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodall; upon paine of evry one of the said clergy doing the contrary to this act, &amp; thereof convicted, to suffer imprisonment and make fine at the king's will. 25.

               <p>By these Particulars any may see that <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> had good ground to say, as he doth on. 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. That King <hi>Henry</hi> took all that power to himself which the <hi>Pope</hi> challenged <hi>[atque ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>But this title of <hi>supreme head</hi> gave offence both at home &amp; abroad &amp; therefore Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> did change it into this <hi>[of supreme governour over all persons, as well in all causes ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick as civill]</hi> &amp; in these tearms it was keeped, &amp; is to this day: But all this change, did not much help the matter; for many were offended even there at, and what wonder, seing it seemed to attribute to her Maj. no lesse spirituall jurisdiction &amp; power then what the former oath did importe. Whereupon the Queen, in the first year of her reigne, after the Parliament had condescended on the forementioned oath published an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition in her injunctions, of purpose, to explaine &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret the sense &amp; meaning thereof; &amp; gave it this sense <hi>[That nothing was, is or shall be meant or intended by the same oath, to have any other duty alleagiance or bond required by the same then was acknowledged to be due to the most noble kings of famous me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory King Henry 8. her Maj. father &amp; King Edward 6. her Maj. brother. That her Maj. neither doth nor ever will challenge any other authority, then that which was challenged, &amp; lately used by the saids noble kings, which is and was of ancient time due to the imperiall crowne of this realme. That is under God to have the soveraignity &amp; rule over all manner of persones borne within these realmes, dominions &amp; countreyes, of what estate either ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall or temporall, soever they be; so as no other forraigne power shall, or ought to have any superiority over them.]</hi> And this was confirmed by Parliament 5.

                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1568.

But all this did not preserve the Church from incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for when <hi>Montgom.</hi> pretended Archb. of <hi>Glasgow</hi> was proceeded against, the <hi>king</hi> summoned the whole synod of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian</hi> before him &amp; afterward when this same <hi>Mr Montgomery</hi> was summoned before the Nationall Assembly, there came a Messin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of armes from his Maj. to discharge the Assembly under the paine of rebellion &amp; of puting of them to the horne, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed any furder; whereupon the assembly did complaine of this incroachment, <hi>April 27, Anno</hi> 1580. as such the like whereof had never been made before.

               </p>
               <p>By the endeavours of these faithfull worthies, any may see what a Spirit was stirring then, when the King would assume to himself spirituall power &amp; authority, &amp; so rob <hi>Christ</hi> of that which belongeth to him, as King &amp; head of the Church; &amp; make himself a Pope &amp; the fountaine of all power &amp; jurisdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, both civill &amp; ecclesiastick, &amp; challenge power, to give commission for deposeing &amp; ordaineing of Ministers, &amp; hinder free preaching, to try &amp; censure doctrine, &amp; to anull all Church censures as he pleased. This was the Spirit that was then stirring at court, &amp; this is the supremacy to the life, &amp; this was it which court parasites said, did belong unto the crown, let the Church, say &amp; do to the contrary what she could. Hence a little after this <hi>Mr Melvin</hi> was accused for his sermon, &amp; after he had declined the King &amp; his Councell as incompe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent judges in that cause, was forced to withdraw to <hi>Berwick,</hi> for fear of his life.</p>

                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1584.

               <p>After this blast was something blown over <hi>Anno</hi> 1592.

               </p>
               <p>But the King went on, &amp; told the Ministers thereafter, <q>[That there should be no agreement betwixt him &amp; them, untill the marches of their jurisdiction were rid, &amp; that they might not speak in pulpit of the affaires of the Estate or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, &amp; that no Generall Assembly should meet without his special command, &amp; that Church judicatures should meddle with fornication &amp; luch like scandalls, but not with causes whereupon his lawes do strick.]</q> &amp; shortly thereafter <hi>Mr Blake</hi> was summoned &amp; did decline, &amp; his declinature was owned by severall hundereds of Ministers: when King <hi>Iames</hi> saw this he laboured to ensnare the Ministery &amp; therefore invented the bond which was mentioned <hi>Sect. 1.

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:65203:106"/>
of the crown of England then the poor Church findeth his hand heavier then formerly; for <hi>Anno</hi> 1606. Six Ministers were convicted of treason, &amp; condemned for declineing the councell as an incompetent judge in matters ecclesiastick, &amp; all by vertue of the <hi>Act of Parl.</hi> 1584.

And finally <hi>Anno</hi> 1633. in the 1 <hi>Parl.</hi> of King Charles, Act 3. that Act which was made <hi>Anno</hi> 1606. was againe ratified &amp; this conclusion was drawne from it, that he hath <hi>power to prescribe what apparell he thinketh fit for Kirk men,</hi> which was done of purpose for this end that his Maj. might with greater facility get the use of the <hi>surplice</hi> by Ministers, established by law and practised.</p>
               <p>And now by all this, any may see what is the nature of that supremacy which the higher powers have been all alongs grasping after &amp; which the faithfull servants of Christ have been withstanding according to their power.</p>
               <p>But in the last place, the sense &amp; meaning of this late Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which did tender the oath, must be sought out of their acts &amp; actings, &amp; out of some commissions granted by his Maj. &amp; thereby it shall be seen what ground there was of scrupling at the oath &amp; how the feares of such as did then scruple at the oath were not groundlesse seing the after actings of king &amp; Parlia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:65203:107"/>
of their giving to the King, &amp; of his taking, more power in Church matters then themselves would then acknowledge or confesse did belong to him. Now for clearing what power was then &amp; is now assumed by &amp; given to the King in Church matters these particulars may be noticed.</p>
               <p n="1">1.

               <p n="2">2.

               <p>Out of this Act, these things are remarkable. 1. Here is a mixed court made up of Church men &amp; civill men. 2. A court medling both with civil &amp; ecclesiastick punishments, for they have power of deposeing, excommunicating fineing and imprisoneing. 3.

               <p>By what is said, something of the meaning of this oath, according to their sense who tender it, may be discovered, &amp; the bussinesse being so clear much time needeth not be spent, in handling that long &amp; tedious controversie concerning the Magistrats power in Church matters: Onely a hint at some few things, as reasons why this oath thus tendered &amp; explained, could not be taken, will be sufficient.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By this meanes, they should upon the matter have affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the King was <hi>head of the Church</hi> for it is clear that he assumeth to himself power of appoynting new officers in Christ's house, &amp; new courts &amp; judicatures, which Christ did never appoynt, &amp; of committing Church power to whom he will; of appoynting what forme of Government in the Church, he thinketh fit; modelling the constitution of Church idicatories, appoynting who shall be members, &amp; who not, &amp; who mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers <hi>siue quibus non,</hi> of limiting the bounds of their procedour, by appoynting what they shall treat of, &amp; what not; of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life in their canons &amp; constitutions, &amp;c. Thus all Church power shall flow from him, &amp; he shall become the head of the Church, under Christ, the same way that he is head of the commonwealth under God: And indeed the prelate &amp; their creatures, are not ashamed in their publick prayers, to stile the King <hi>head of the Church.</hi> Now could any faithfull &amp; zealous Christian of servant of Christ, consent unto this dreadfull incro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uchment &amp; usurpation, by subscribeing any oath which might import the same: Who can but hear of it, &amp; his heart not

tremble: Let all the arguments which the reformed divines make use of, against the usurped headshipe of the <hi>Pope</hi> be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered &amp; they will, with equall strength, militat against this usurpation, &amp; justifie the refuseing of this oath upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: yea <hi>Arminius</hi> himself <hi>disp. de pontif.

               <p n="2">2. By this meanes, they should upon the matter licke up popery which they have abjured againe &amp; againe, for none will say that they have abjured such a piece of popery, only as it was seated in the head of the man with the treeple crown that sitteth at <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; not simply in it self as a blasphemous tenent: No reformed divine writeth against the <hi>Popes</hi> supremacy &amp; headshipe, as a power usurped by him, to the prejudice of some one prince or other; but as a heigh &amp; insolent usurpation of that, which belongeth unto him who is King of Kings &amp; Lord of Lords, for this were not to speak against an incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made upon the privileges &amp; prerogatives of the King of his Church, but against some civil wrongs done to a neighbour prince or state: &amp; indeed the adversaries are not ashamed to say that the <hi>Pope</hi> in his usurpation of this Church jurisdiction, wronged not Christ; but more immediatly the King &amp; Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, unto whom that power did belong of right before &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they say, that King <hi>Henry</hi> 8. assumed but his own back againe &amp; that he neither took, nor did the Parliament give him, any new power which did not belong to him before: So said <hi>Heylyn</hi> as was showne.

The prelats are his Maj.

But to this they could not assent, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could not take the oath.</p>
               <p n="4">4. By this meanes, they should grant that the supreme Magistrat himself, might, immediatly in his own person; rebuke publickly the scandalous, debarr from the sacraments, depose, suspend &amp; excommunicate; for what his commissioners do, by vertue of a commission from him, that he may do himself immediatly, But this could no be yeelded to; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not the least warrand for it imaginable out of the word, but much against it: &amp; therefore none, except an <hi>Erastian</hi> or <hi>Arminian</hi> will condemne such as refuse an oath which would import this, see <hi>Voetius de politia ecclesi, pag. 146. arg.</hi> 12.</p>

They do not much value the glosses which any may devise afterward, to cover the shame of their nakednesse: were it not better to hold back such as run too willingly of their own accord, to the ruine of religion, &amp; the interests of Christ?

By this oath they should grant that the civill, magistrat as such, should be a Church member; because he who hath a chief hand in Church affaires, cannot but be a Church member: he who is a chief member in Church judicatories, cannot but be a Church member: He who hath Church power cannot but be a Church member: &amp; he whose com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners Ministers are in Church administrations, must certanely be a Churchmember: Now all these they give unto the King not as a Christian, but as a King; for they annex them unto the crown, and make them part of the royall prerogative. But this cannot be assented un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, for then every heathen Magistrat should be a Church member, because a heathen Magistrat is a Magistrat, as essentially, as a Christian Magistrat: Christianity addeth no Magistratical power, it maketh not one more a King or a magistrat, then he was; it only qualifieth &amp; inableth him for the right administration, or execution of the power, but addeth no new power. Moreover magistracy hath nothing to do, either with the matter or with the forme of Church member shipe, reall grace &amp; union with Christ maketh one a member of Christ's mysticall body; &amp; serjous profession of the true religion, maketh one a member of the visible Church, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistraticall power, honour, &amp; dignity hath no interest here, no such thing commendeth a man to Christ.</p>
               <p n="8">8.

It is not credible that Christ should have appoynted such an eminent Church officer who was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue unto the end of the world &amp; never shew us how he should be called, nor what his qualifications should be, nor the way of his ordination, nor his work. 3. Then women &amp; chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren might be such eminent Church officers. 4, Or none should be supreme Magistrats, but such as are fit for such an eminent Charge in the Church. But both these are false.</p>

It was intended for this end, that he might have power to call, convent, judge &amp; sentence Ministers for the faithfull discharge of their duty, &amp; exoneration of their consciences, as

By the taking of this oath thus tendered, they should grant that the supreme Magistrat is exempted from subjection unto the Ministery of the messingers of the Lord; for if Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters in their Ministeriall function, acte as commissioners from him, &amp; as accountable to him; then in the same administration they cannot be above him; a commissioner in the particular wherein he is a commissioner, cannot be over him whose com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner he is.

               <p n="14">14. By taking of this oath, they should yeeld unto many palpable &amp; into lerable incroachment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> made upon the liberties &amp; privileges of the Church of Christ, Which could not be done without great sin &amp; iniquity: As 1. That there could be no Church judicatories or assemblies without his warrand or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse consent for in the act concerning the acknowledging of the royall prerogative, among other things annexed to the crown, this is one, <hi>the conveening of his subjects,</hi> &amp; this is explaned Act 4. Where it is ordained that none <hi>of his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects conveen for holding of—Assemblies, to treat Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult &amp; determine in any matter—ecclesiasticke:</hi> And upon this ground doth the act concerning the nationall Synod goe: And upon this ground did King <hi>Iames</hi> take upon him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate assemblies either to definite or indefinite times, as he thought good. Now no faithfull Minister or Christian could assent to this: Because 1. Whatever may be said upon the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:65203:114"/>
grounds of prudence at some times; yet when the bussinesse is spoken to, as a case of conscience, &amp; according to the rule of the word, this is true, that though the Church be in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth yet she is a distinct society from the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, &amp; hath power from Christ, to hold her own meetings &amp; Assemblies, for her own government, as she did while she was under heathen Emperours in the dayes of the Apostles. 2, It hath been showne before what is the judgment of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in this particular, in their preface to the confession of faith. 3. There is no expresse command either for seeking or having his expresse consent. The reformers of the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> never once thought of this, but as oft as conveniently they might, &amp; as necessity urged, they keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Assemblies, not only without the consent of the supreme Magistrat, but oftimes against their will, thinking it their duty to Assemble for the relief of the Church ay untill some diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty were laid in their way which they could not win over, untill some phisicall restraint, or some what equivalent were laid upon them. 5. It would neither be fit nor saife, for them to condemne the worthies who stood so zealously for the truth, &amp; keeped that Assembly at <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> which occasioned their banishment. 2. That the power of convocating &amp; indicting of Synods &amp; Assemblies doth belong only unto the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strat. The act for the <hi>National Synod</hi> doth abundantly cleare this. But to assent to this were a palpable wronging of the Church which hath intrinsick power for this, &amp; needeth not goe out of her self to seek it. The Synod which did meet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> 15 was not indicted by any civil Magistrat. The Church should then be in an irremediable case when the civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strat is an enemy; but God hath provided meanes for the saifty &amp; preservation of his Church, Even when the higher powers are but small friends unto her, (as oftimes it falleth out) see the judicious &amp; learned doct. <hi>Voet: de Pol: Eccles: Pag. 184.

That the power of delegating unto assemblies doth belong to him alone, so as he may appoynt all the consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuent members thereof, according as he pleaseth, as the Act for the nationall Synod sayeth, he doth; &amp; that by vertue of
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:65203:114"/>
his supremacy. But this were a grosse wronging, &amp; robbing of Churches, of their power &amp; privilege, of delegating such, as they think fit, according to the Example of <hi>Antioch</hi> send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Paul</hi> &amp; <hi>Barnabas</hi> to that <hi>Synod Act</hi> 15. &amp; the practice of the Church in all ages see <hi>Voet: ubi supra Pag. 187 Quaest. 7. &amp;</hi> 8. Yea if so the persones delegated should vote in his name &amp; not in the name of Christ, or of the Church: &amp; the meeting should not be a pure Church meeting but either wholly <hi>politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,</hi> or else <hi>politico-ecclesiasticall.</hi> 4. That he might dissolve Church assemblies, &amp; Synods when he pleaseth for the fore men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>Act</hi> for the <hi>Nat.

There is no warrand for any such dependence of Church judicatories upon the civil Magistrat's discretion. If Christ hath allowed Synods to his Church for determineing in Church affaires, he hath allowed them to sit untill they finish the bussinesse for which they did assemble: Yea if they should yeeld to this they should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the assembly at <hi>Glasgow</hi> 1638. which did sit untill they had ended their bussinesse, notwithstanding of a command to dissolve. 5. That his presence or the presence of his commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssioner is necessary unto each nationall assembly, for the <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> ratifying the <hi>Act for the nationall Synod</hi> sayeth expresly that <hi>without the presence of the King or of his commissioner no nationall Synod can be keeped.</hi> But 1. there is no law of God for this. 2. The Synods in the primitive times, were held with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his presence. 3. There were many generall assemblies held in <hi>Scotland</hi> without his presence. 4. The Magistrat as such is no constituent member of the Synod, &amp; therefore his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence is not necessarily requisite see <hi>Voet: ubi supra Pag. 188. Quaest.</hi> 9. 5. If there be such a necessity for his presence at <hi>nationall Synods,</hi> he must not be absent from lesser assemblies, &amp; thus there shall be no Church judicature held without his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, which were most absurd: See what the learned &amp; famous
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:65203:115"/>
                  <hi>Voetius</hi> sayeth to this <hi>pol. Eccles. Part. 1. Pag.</hi> 199. 200. 6. That Ministers have no proper decisive fuffrage in Synods, because the forecited Act sayeth, That matters are to be set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led only by their <hi>advice,</hi> So that in their Synod they are only the King's counsellers conveened to advise &amp; consult, &amp; a power only to advise, is no decisive fuffrage: &amp; so the Act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, is the deed of the supreme Magistrat following their advice, &amp; is not their deed. Now this is most absurd &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive to all Synods, &amp; of all their power: &amp; thus it should be far worse with Synods now, when Magistrats are Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians then when they were heathens. Moreover there is no warrand for his having with the rest of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> the commissioners, a voice in those Synods, far lesse, for his having the whole power. It is clear that as a Magistat he can have no suffrage or voice in these Synods; for then heathens who are no way qualified for such a bussinesse should have it likewise, Yea if it were so, all the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of Synods should be civil Acts, &amp; no Church Acts, being done by one who is no Church officer, yea nor a Church member, as such, let be a Church judicature.

That the judicatories of the Church be prelimit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: for nothing may be enacted by the <hi>nationall Synod</hi> which is contrary to his Maj. royal prerogative; or to the lawes of the land, so sayeth the Parliaments ratification of the Act for the nationall Synod. But what if iniquity be established by a law; &amp; what if Christ's royall prerogatives be taken from him &amp; given to the King? shall the Church in her judicatories do nothing for the truth? shall she give no testimony against these usurpations? shall the lawes of the land &amp; the King's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives be her <hi>Cynosura?</hi> what use shall be made of the word of God then? where is there any such caution or limitation given to the Church? But enough of this. 8. That Church judicatories may not so much as consult &amp; debate, about any
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:65203:115"/>
Act, matter or cause, but what shall be allowed &amp; approved by his Maj. or his commissioner; for these are the very words of the Act of Parliament.

That no Church canon or ordinance hath any effect force or validity but what shall be approved &amp; confirmed by him or his commissioner, for so much doth the fore cited Act import, now who but he who hath drunken in the opinions of <hi>Erastus</hi> &amp; <hi>Arminians</hi> will assent unto this? It is true the canons &amp; ordinances of a Church judicatory, cannot have the strength of a municipall law, without the Magistrat's civill sanction: But yet they may have the strength of Church Canons, whether he approve of them, or not; as the Acts of the Councell at <hi>Ierusal. Act</hi> 15. &amp; of all other Synods &amp; As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies, which the Church had dureing the first three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered yeers had: Otherwise the Church should be in a hard case, when the civill Magistrat did refuse his concurrence. &amp; (as hath been oft hinted) in a better case, under heathens, then under Christian Magistrats. Therefore this could not be assented unto. 10. That all Church Canons are his proper Acts, &amp; flow natively from him, &amp; his power; for the meeting is but for Counsell &amp; advice to him, &amp; all which they say, is without force unlesse he approve it, as the <hi>Act</hi> sayeth, &amp; so all their Acts &amp; Canons are his only &amp; not theirs. But this could not be granted, because 1. what ever he doth, as supreme Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, or Magistrat, is a civill Act &amp; no Church Act, &amp; so no Church Canon. 2. No Church Canon can be made by any but by Church Officers, who are impowered by <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> for that effect, but the Magistrat as such is no Church Officer. 3. This power is without all warrand of Scripture, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can not be acknowledged.</p>

But to proceed.</p>
               <p n="15">15. By this oath, They should grant that the Church is very imperfect so long as she wanteth a Christian Magistrat; for she wanteth a chief Officer: And hence it will follow, that the Church in the dayes of the Apostles &amp; some hundereds of Years thereafter was imperfect as to its Constitution, want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this supreme Governour: Otherwise they must say that <hi>Nero, Caligula,</hi> &amp; the rest of the Roman persecuting Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, did sufficiently fill up this place: And that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles did upon the matter, &amp; would not have refused, plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to have affirmed that these persecuting heathens, were su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Governours over all persones, &amp; in all causes Civill &amp; Ecclesiastick. But none of those can be affirmed, with any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bality or shew of reason.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Yea by taking this oath, They should grant that the Apostles &amp; primitive Church, walked not regularly in the matter of governing the Church: Because they acted with no such subordination unto the supreme Magistrat who then was, they derived no power from him as their supreme Governour; in causes Ecclesiastick. To say that necessity did put them to this, is but a poor defence, for then out of necessity the primitive Church did rob the Magistrat of his power, or else this power agreeth not to all Magistrats; but only to Christian Magistrats, &amp; it so, it cannot be a power or Privilege an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the Crown; And further it doth not agree to them as Christians, nor yet as Magistrats otherwise it should agree to all Christians, &amp; to all Magistrats, which is false: &amp; therefore

                  </gap> in the primitive times there was a forme of Church Government followed, the poynt is gained by Mr Stillingfleet's own concessions; for <hi>part</hi> 1. c. 1: § 3. He sayeth that <hi>there is not the same necessitie for a particular clear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, in the alteration of a law unrepealed in some circumstanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of it, as there is, for the establishing of a new law: as to the former, a different practice by persons guided by an infallible Spirit is sufficient, which is the case, as to the observation of the Lord's day under the Gospell; for the fourth command standing in force, as to the morality of it, a different practice, by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:65203:118"/>
may be sufficient, for the particular determination of the more rituall &amp; occasionall part of it.</hi> Now there being a stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing morall law for a forme of Church governement, the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the Apostles who were guided by an infallible Spirit is sufficient for an alteration: And so as their practice oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth now, to the observation of the first day Sabbath, because of the standing force of the morall law for one day of Seven; So their practice obligeth now unto that forme of Governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which they used, because of the standing force of the law of God for a forme of Church Governement: So that we need not enquire after a particular &amp; clear revelation in this case where there is but the alteration of a law unrepealed as to some particular circumstances. And thus, if the morality of the first day Sabbath stand, the morality of the governement of the Church which the Apostles did set up, will stand also. Their practice altering the last day of Seven into the first, will no more oblige then their altering of the ancient governement, into a new one, which was distinct from the former.</p>

                  <hi>Obs. 2. Part. 2. c.</hi> 1. §. 4, 5, 6. When he is about the state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the question he will have a nationall Church, to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood as a Church in which a forme of Government should be setled. It is true a nationall society incorporated, is a Church; It is also true that the notion of a Church agreeth to other societies, then nationall, &amp; as himself sayes, wherever the notion of a Church particular is to be found, there must be a Governement in that Church: &amp; so every society which may be called a Church, should have a Governement in it. But now the question is whether every such society as may be called a <hi>Church,</hi> should have its own liberty, to set up what forme of Government it thinketh best, or only <hi>a nationall Church?</hi> If only <hi>a nationall Church</hi> have that liberty then that liberty agreeth not to <hi>a nationall Church,</hi> as it is a <hi>Church,</hi> but under some other notion, &amp; what is this other notion? Is it because they are under one civil Governement? But many na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may in some respect be under one civil Government, &amp; in some respect there is hardly any one nation, which in all its parts incorporations &amp; cities, is governed after one &amp; the same
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:65203:118"/>
manner. But further, what hath the Church to do with the civill lawes or civill way of Governement, especially se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself granteth that the Church is a quite distinct society from the civil state? But next if every Church hath this liberty then in one &amp; the same nationall Church, there may be many severall sorts of Governements, &amp; this would occasion the greatest confusion in the world, &amp; looketh no way like the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God, which neither tendeth to union nor edification but to confusion &amp; distraction, &amp; will make every parochial Church (&amp; he cannot deny a parochiall Church to be a Church) to have its own distinct forme of Government, thus porachiall Churches should be like the <hi>Cant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

If it be said that the unity &amp; peace of the <hi>nationall Church</hi> ought much more to be looked after, then the peace &amp; unity of any one particular <hi>congregation Ans.</hi> will it thence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that every particular congregation, in a nationall Church, should be Governed after one manner? then it will follow also that all nationall Churches being members of the Church uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall, must be Governed after one &amp; the same manner; for the peace &amp; unity of the <hi>Church universall</hi> is preferable unto the peace &amp; unity of a <hi>Nat.

so determined by a positive law of God, that all the Churches of Christ, are bound to observe it; but that it is left to the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, of every particular Church to agree upon its own forme, which it judgeth most fit for the ends of Governement, in it self: &amp; if this be his drift &amp; scope, may not every one see how he prevaricateth here, in limiting the disput to these two formes; seing there are moe formes pretended unto. The <hi>independents</hi> will grant that there is no warrand in the word for either of those two formes mentioned; &amp; yet will allaidge that there is another forme allowed of God &amp; determined: The <hi>Papists</hi> have a forme of Government, &amp; it may be the prelats think that their forme differeth from that. The <hi>Morellians</hi> have another forme distinct from all these, the <hi>Erastians</hi> have a sixt, &amp; it is possible that <hi>Mr Baxter</hi> shall give him a seventh made out of <hi>presbyterian episcopall, independent &amp; Erastian.</hi> now if his principles exclude all these why was the disput limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to two? or doth he think that these other formes are expresly excluded by the word, &amp; that Churches are not left at liberty to make choise of any of them, but only of either of the two which he mentioned? Then the scripture is expresly &amp; deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minatly against severall formes of Governement, &amp; if this be true, his principles are overturned, for if the law of God be expresly against some formes, it must be more for other for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, then for these, &amp; all formes are not indifferent, nor are men left at liberty to pitch upon what forme they please.</p>

That the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church ought to be administred by officers of divine appoyntment.</hi> And now what shall become of that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by a superiour order above the standing ministery; for a prelat as a superiour order is a distinct officer from presbyters; &amp; so must have a divine appoyntment, &amp; if he hath a divine appoyntment, he must be a standing officer, as well as pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters; &amp; if so, men must not, as they please, lay him by; but the Government by prelats must be <hi>juris divini:</hi> &amp; if upon the other hand, he be really a distinct officer, &amp; hath no divine warrant, or appoyntment, the Government of the Church by prelats must be utterly unlawfull.</p>

But what sayeth he to this objection? <hi>Part. 2. c. 4. §. 11. These officers are only said to be new that were never appoynted by Christ: &amp; the Church may appoynt none such: but if such be mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as have a Charge of more then one particular congregation by the consent of pastours themselves, such an officer is not ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>; for beside the generall practice of the Church, from the first primitive times, which have all consented in the use of such officers, we finde the foundation of this power laid by Christ himself, in the power which the Apostles were invested in, which was extended over many both pastours, &amp; Churches; &amp; this power must be proved extraordinary, before it can be said to cease; &amp; that must be done by some arguments proper to their persones; for if they be of a morall nature, they will prove the office, to be so too—I say not but that the necessity of the office, as in their persons, for the first preaching &amp; propagating the Gospell did cease with them; but that after their death it became unlawfull to take Charge of di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>To which it is answered. 1.

the commentaries of Hegesippus, &amp;c. Pag.</hi> 296. 297. 3. To let this passe. <hi>Mr Stilling sleet</hi> would do well to shew whether the office of Apostles (which is a distinct thing from their extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary immediat mission (which he is pleased to make the maine distinguishing note of an Apostle) &amp; also from the power of working miracles to confirme the truth of what they preached) did cease by God's warrand and approbation or not: if not, how could any be so bold as to lay this office aside, by which persons should be invested with power over many both Churches and pastours? &amp; how can any say that it is not still necessary: Mr <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> seemeth here to plead for the divine right of prelacy: And indeed if the office &amp; power of Apostles be the same with prelacie, &amp; if that power or office be not laid a side with God's warrand &amp; approbation, it must still be an office allowed of God, &amp; if so, Mr <hi>Stillingfleet's</hi> notion will fall to the ground. His saying that <hi>the necessitie of the office, as in their persons for the first preaching &amp; propagating the Gospell is ceased</hi> is nothing to the purpose, for he must speak of the office, as it is the same with the office of Prelats. It is certaine the necessity of the office as in their persons must cease, because they are gone, &amp; the work of first preaching &amp; propagating the Gospell, could be done by none after them, when they had done it themselves but that was not their ordinary office, if Mr <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> speak truth here. If this office did cease by God's warrand, then how can any raise it up againe without his expresse warrand? for either it was the Lord's will when he caused it to cease, that it should cease till he was pleased to make use of it againe, or till men pleased to raise it up, at their owne pleasure: This last cannot be proved &amp; therefore seing God thought fit to lay is aside &amp; gave no signification of his minde, when the Chur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

&amp; the speciall proper qualifications, with which such offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers were endued, when those cease the office ceaseth; &amp; God thereby declareth that the office &amp; work was extraordinary, &amp; therefore should not continue.

And because of the want of this expresse pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition will it be lawfull now for any to set up such officers &amp; offices, in the house of God, when God giveth not the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications &amp; so giveth not the call thereunto? So is it in this case of the Apostles; when their qualifications, &amp; their speciall work ceased, their office ceased; &amp; there will be no call for such of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers till there be fit work, &amp; God give fit qualifications; &amp; without a call &amp; warrand it must be unlawfull to set up such an office againe. This will be clearer if it be considered what was the speciall work of an Apostle It was this. <hi>A planting of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, &amp; setling of the Gospell government in them, by ins<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

By this it is clear. 5. That the power &amp; office of Apostles laid no foundation for prelaticall power, the work belonging to them as such, being altogether extraordinare. It is true, their power did extend over many Churches &amp; pastours but yet. 1. They were not fixed to such &amp; such particular dioecies, as propper to themselves; but sometimes moe of them were to gether in one place, following their work, Nor. 2.

did they ordaine alone in Churches constituted. nor. 4 Did they exerce jurisdiction alone, but alwayes they joyned oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with them in Churches setled. 5. They assumed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves no negative voice either in ordination or jurisdiction: &amp; so in them there could be no foundation for prelacy laid, even as to their common work, or work of a lasting nature which did not properly &amp; peculiarly appertaine to them as Apostles. 6.

               <p>But distrusting this answer he giveth a second §. 12. to this purpose. <hi>The extending of any Ministeriall power, is not the appoynting of a new office, because every Minister hath a relation</hi> Actu primo, <hi>to the whole Church of God, the resiraint &amp; enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of which power is subject to positive determinations of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence &amp; conveniency</hi> in Actu secundo—<hi>The exercise and execution of the power of order belongeth to every one in his perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall capacity, but as to the power of jurisdiction, though it belong habitually and</hi> Actu primo <hi>to each presbyter, yet being about mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of publicke and common concernment, the limit ation and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of it belongeth to the Church in common (such is the power of visiting Churches, of ordination and censures) and when this is devolved to some particular persons, by the rest of the pastors or by the Magisrat,</hi> quoad executionem <hi>it belongeth to them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. This contradicteth the former answer, for the former answer did suppone that these were distinct officers from presbyters, because their office was such as the ordinary of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Apostles; and the Apostles were distinct from other Church officers, even by their office, &amp; not in respect only of their extraordinare mission, or power of working miracles. But this answer affirmeth them to be one &amp; the same with pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters. But. 2. By this answer he might plead for the <hi>Pope</hi> for every Minister <hi>in actis primo</hi> hath a relation to the whole Church &amp; so might be a <hi>Pope,</hi> if the supreme Magistrat or the rest of the Ministers, would devolve upon him the execution of the power of jurisdiction; &amp; so the <hi>Pope</hi> is no new officer
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:65203:121"/>
but a mere presbyter, only his power of jurisdiction is enlairged: So may he plead for <hi>Cardmals, Patriarchs, Primats, Archbishops,</hi> as well as for Bishops. But it will be objected that the <hi>Pope</hi> pretendeth to some other thing as the warrand of his power even to <hi>a jus divinum Ans.</hi> &amp; so do prelats, but with Mr <hi>Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet,</hi> all is one whether that be pretended unto, or not, for it is no matter what they say of themselves, but what any may feigne of them, to the end they may both deceive others, &amp; be deceived themselves. This is, as if one would defend a man who had taken upon himself to be a King of such or such a common wealth, contrare to the fundamentall lawes of the land, and would alledge that he were no distinct officer from any other member of Parliam. because (for sooth) the power of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as to its execution, is subject to positive determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, &amp; Parliaments may, &amp; do commissionat some of their number to some eminent piece of work, as to be <hi>a Generall</hi> or the like; &amp; he who calleth himself <hi>King,</hi> is nothing else, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that he rule the commonw. with as absolute power &amp; unlimited, as ever King did. Sure any man of understanding would smile at such a defence, and just such an one is Mr <hi>Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet's,</hi> prelats rule &amp; domineer with as absolute &amp; unlimited power, as ever any did, &amp; when it is alledged that they account themselves distinct officers from, &amp; superiour to other presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, &amp; that there is no warrand for any such officers Mr <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet,</hi> their new advocat cometh in, &amp; sayeth: They are no distinct officers, let themselves say what they will, you may take them up as no distinct officers, &amp; so suffer them to domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer still, if you look upon them as no distinct officers there is no hazard, all is saife, be they <hi>Pope</hi> be they <hi>Prelat</hi> &amp; let them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to never so high &amp; speciall commissions, as speciall &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct officers, yet they may be submitted unto &amp; obeyed, this mentall conception will make all right. 3. When any are disput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against an intruder in the house of God whether is it saifest to take him up, in his own colours &amp; to look upon him as he holdeth forth himself, or to paint him as any think best? If any disputant would take liberty to paint him as he pleaseth he should not dispute for truth, but deal deceitfully. Let <hi>Mr
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:65203:122"/>
Stillingfleet</hi> answere this question: Whether is it possible that a man may give out himself for a new officer, or not? or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any hazard that such an one may be acknowledged &amp; countenanced as an officer &amp; as such an officer as he giveth himself forth to be, in the house of God: or not? If <hi>Mr Stillingfleet</hi> be consonant to his principles, he must answere that it is not possible: for really there can be no new officers war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randed of God; &amp; every one is at liberty to take them up under a right notion: &amp; there is an end: &amp; then let all the popish rable &amp; ten times moe come in, they may be submitted unto; for really there can be no other officers in God's house, but pastours &amp; deacons (with <hi>Mr Stillingfleet)</hi> &amp; every one may look on all the rest as having their power either restricted or enlairged, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the determination of prudence. 4. It may be asked: whether the Apostles were distinct officers from presbyt. yea or not? If they were distinct; what was it which made them distinct? It could not be their different way of mission for <hi>Matthias</hi> had not such a mission as <hi>Iames, Iohn</hi> &amp; <hi>Peter</hi> &amp; the rest had &amp; yet all of them were Apostles &amp; <hi>Matthias</hi> no lesse then the rest. It could not be their extraordinary qualifications, for <hi>Prophets</hi> &amp; <hi>workers of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles</hi> &amp; <hi>speakers with tongues,</hi> had extraordinary qualifications; &amp; yet they were not the same with <hi>Apostles:</hi> &amp; further distinct quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications make not distinct officers. Or was it a larger extended power? Then it is certane that prelats upon the same account must be distinct officers, from other presbyters; for they have a larger extended power then other presbyters have. 5. Doth <hi>Mr Stillingfl.</hi> think that there is no difference betuixt a man who acteth as commissionated from a judicature, having his power &amp; particular commission from them; &amp; a man who doth all of himself by his own power, having a commission from none? &amp; that there is no difference betuixt one who receiveth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands from others as accountable to them, &amp; one who tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon him to command them as he thinkest best: &amp; betuixt the generall of an army sent forth by the Estates of a land (ruled without a King) having power &amp; commission from them; &amp; a King making use of the Estates, or of the Parliament of the Kingdome as his counsellours whose advice he will follow, or
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:65203:122"/>
not follow, as seemeth him good, &amp; commanding all of them a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> pleaseth him best? If he think that there is no difference betuixt these, then indeed he cannot be much blamed for thinking that the prelat whom he busketh, is one &amp; the same with the prelat of whom the controversie is. But in sober sadnesse let it be asked of <hi>Mr Stillingfleet;</hi> If he did satisfie himself with this his fiction &amp; notion. There is no controversy now about what may be, or of a man in the moon, but of the prelats who are now in being, &amp; concerning these it would be asked whether he thinketh that they ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> chosen by the Church over which they are, &amp; that they are impowered by that Church, or by the officers of that Church, for that effect, &amp; that they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable unto them, so that their power may be restrained at the Churches pleasure: Or not rather that they choose &amp; ordaine the presbyters, &amp; commissionat them, calling them to an account, &amp; punishing as they think sit, usurping &amp; useing this power as their owne, not borrowing it from the presbyters, in whole or in part, as being themselves solely invested with all Church power from Christ, &amp; letting out the same to presbyters as they think meet. Now it is of these that the controversy is &amp; it is such as are understood when it is said that they are new Church officers, &amp; there is no controversy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Mr Stillingfleet's</hi> supposed Commissioners; for whether such as he speaketh of; be new distinct officers, or not, it is no matter, so long as these of whom the disput is, are such without all question, for any thing which <hi>Mr Stillingfleet</hi> hath said to the contrary; for the persons he speaketh of, are not the same with the persons concerning whom the controversy is: Commissioners having all their power derived from others are one thing, &amp; such as have all the power from &amp; with in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are another thing. But. 6. To put the matter more out of doubt, let it be considered that a distinct proper work with a distinct ordination for that effect, is enough to make a distinct officer: What distinguisheth <hi>Presbyters</hi> &amp; <hi>Dea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ns</hi> (Let rule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing elders be laid a side, seing <hi>Mr Stillingfleet</hi> will not owne them as Church officers) but their distinct peculiar work &amp; ordination: &amp; so since prelats assume to themselves as their pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:65203:123"/>
work, the power of jurisdiction, &amp; ordination (to speak nothing of the power of order) they do account themselves, &amp; so must all take them to be, distinct officers: All the prelats that ever were yet in the world, did look upon themselves as distinct from presbyters: &amp; all who ever wrote of prelats, took them up as such (whether <hi>Iure Divino</hi> or <hi>Humano</hi> all is one, as to this bussinesse of their being distinct) till <hi>Mr Stlling fleet</hi> did vent his new notions. 7. That a judicature which acteth joyntly in matters of jurisdiction, may, in some particulars for facilitating their execution, impower one or moe of their number for that effect, is easily grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but that they may so Impower them, as to denude themselves wholly of the power; &amp; so enlarge the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of others as to null their owne; must be otherway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es proved then by <hi>Mr Stilling fleet's</hi> bare assertion: Christ's commission taketh in both the power of order &amp; jurisdiction, &amp; alloweth his servants no more to denude themselves of the one, then of the other. They themselves must answere for the duties of the one as well as for the duties of the other: And every Presbyter hath the <hi>Ius</hi> to both as well <hi>in actu secundo</hi> as <hi>in actu primo.</hi> judicious <hi>V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

here in this place, which is now under consideration <hi>Mr Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet</hi> is pleased to rancke up ordination under the power of juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, yet else where viz. <hi>Pag.</hi> 273. he sayeth that, <hi>The col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of orders doth come from the power of order &amp; not meerly from the power of jurisdiction.</hi> 8. How cometh the Christian Magistrat in here to appoynt the constant limitation, &amp; exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of the power committed by Christ, unto Church Officers? This is a very great power granted unto the civill Magistrat &amp; some warrand would be seen for it: But this is not the proper place to examine his notions concerning the power of the civill Magistrat in Church matters. Enough of this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obs.</hi> 5. With Presbyterians; the practice of the Apostles, &amp; of the Churches in their dayes, following their appoynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment &amp; command, is of much weight. It is true their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples as examples, do not binde; But when the Lord hath sent them forth, for this end &amp; errand, to plante Churches, to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine new offices, &amp; officers, immediatly under him, and to appoynt unto these officers, their proper work, &amp; to show them how &amp; what way they should goe about their work, &amp; when in all things they delivered nothing to the Church but what they received of the Lord, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11: 23. &amp; as <hi>Tertull.</hi> said <hi>de praeser. adv. haereses, Apostoli nihil ex suo arbitrio elege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt quod inducerent, sed acceptam à Christo disciplinam fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter nationibus assignaverunt;</hi> Sure then their practice &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample ought to be followed. Seing they were sent forth for this end especially, viz. to reforme &amp; setle Churches in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, worship, discipline &amp; governement, according to a new Gospell modell, can any think that we are not obliged to follow their practices. It it true there can be no duty without a law making it a duty; But Christ's sending them forth for this end, &amp; giving them a speciall commission for this work, sending them forth as the Father sent him, &amp; breathing the Holy Ghost upon them, &amp; commanding them, <hi>Math. 28: v. 19, 20. To goe &amp; teach all Nations all things which he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them:</hi> &amp; <hi>Act. 1: 2, 3. Speaking to them of the things pertainting to the Kingdome of God.</hi> By which sayeth <hi>Calvin</hi>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:65203:124"/>
on the place, <hi>Is signified that Christ would not goe away till first he had seen to the governement of the Church,</hi> carry a law in their bosome, &amp; say that their example is obligeing: And when there is a law or warrand for following such an example, it is but in vaine to dispute, whether it be the example which bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, or the rule making it our duty to follow such an example. But moreover he will grant that examples in actions that are morall naturall are obligeing (whether as examples, or by reason of the morality of the action, needeth not be anxiously enquired after) &amp; will not actions done by them upon mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall grounds, that are of perpetuall concernement, become actions morall naturall, &amp; so obligeing? Is not their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in observing the first day Sabbath, obligeing? And why? He sayes, because there was a morall law standing in force concerning the observation of one day in Seven: Why then shall not their example in observing such or such a forme of governement be obligeing, seing there was a morall law standing in force concerning the governement of the Church in generall? Is there any rule extant making their example in the one case obligeing, &amp; not in the other? If the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall practice in the one case make an Apostolicall tradition, &amp; so a divine institution, so will their practice do in the other case: yea the examples of the Churches practise in the Apost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les times, &amp; hints from their writtings do sufficiently evidence an institution; we read of elders in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> &amp; hence we saifly argue that they were ordained, though we read not in <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis terminantibus</hi> of the manner how they were ordained, (sayeth one.)</p>
               <p>But he hath foure things to object against this ground taken from the practice of the Apostles, though acted by the Spirit <hi>Part. 2. cap.</hi> 6. §. 20.</p>
               <p>As 1. <hi>That the Apostles did many things without any inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of obligeing others, as preaching without maintenance,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The consequence is null. Because they did many things without such an intention, will it follow, Ergo they did nothing with such an intention? 2. The disput is about such actions as were done by them by vertue of their speciall office &amp;
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:65203:124"/>
calling, of which kinde, this is none, to preach at some Churches without wages. 3. Yea this same action of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without wages, is to be imitated in the like cases, that is, when Ministers have a competent livelyhood otherwise, as <hi>Paul</hi> had who said, <hi>he robed other Churches, 1 Cor. 11: ver.</hi> 8. &amp; when there is no other way to stope the mouthes of false teachers, who thereby take occasion to hinder the good of the Gospell, for this was the thing which moved <hi>Paul</hi> to take <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>o wages from <hi>Corinth. That he might cut off occasion from them that desired occasion,</hi> and these were the false Apostles, 1 <hi>Cor. 11: v.</hi> 12, 13.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He sayeth, <hi>The Apostles did many things upon particular occasions, emergencies &amp; circumstances, which things so done cannot binde by vertue of their doing them, any furder then a parity of reason doth conclude the same things to be done, as</hi> Paul's <hi>celebat, commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of goods, their preaching from house to house, absteaning from blood, &amp;c. Ans.</hi> this is still to argue <hi>a particulari</hi> because such &amp; such particular practices oblige not <hi>Ergo</hi> no practice oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, is a weak consequence. 2. Actions done upon particular occasions &amp; emergencies, are of another nature, then such actions as are done upon morall &amp; lasting grounds. 3. If even those actions binde upon the ground of a parity of reason, much more will these binde upon the same account: for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ground or reason be given why the Apostles followed such a modell of Government in their dayes, will stand good now, &amp; evince that the same modell ought to be followed. 4. And where as he sayeth <hi>before an acknowledged Apostolicall practice be looked on as obligatory, it must be made appear, that what they did, was not according as they saw reason &amp; cause, for the doing of it, depending upon the severall circumstances of time place and persones; but that they did it from some unalterable law of Christ, or from indispensable reasons, as will equally hold in all times, places &amp; persons</hi> he confirmeth what is now answered; for the reasons of their erecting such a species of Government, do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually hold in all times &amp; places, nothing can be said for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence of such a forme upon the severall circumstances of time place &amp; persons. As for the particulars mentioned by
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:65203:125"/>
him, It is answered. 1. For <hi>Celebat, Christ</hi> himself <hi>Mat. 1 9: v.</hi> 12. restricteth it to such as have the gift of continency, &amp; it bindeth none else. 2. The <hi>Community of goods</hi> was for that time only, for the contrary is practised in after times by all other Churches &amp; Christians; for when <hi>Paul</hi> is pressing the <hi>Corinthians</hi> unto a contribution he never mentioneth this as an argument moving thereunto. 3. Their <hi>preaching from house to house</hi> was for want of conveniency of more publicke places &amp; yet when they had liberty they went to the temple, &amp; to Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons por<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

As for that <hi>Act</hi> 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>abstaineing from blood &amp; things strangled, &amp; things offered to idols</hi> it was only for that time of the scandall, &amp; not alwayes; for Paul taketh off this. 1. <hi>Cor</hi> 10: 25: when he say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>whatsoever is sold in the shambles that eat asking no question for conscience sake</hi> &amp; againe when he sayes. 1. <hi>Tim 4: 3, 4, 5.

There is a great difference betwixt rites &amp; customes, which are alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: &amp; such &amp; such formes of Government which be of a more lasting nature. As for <hi>dipping</hi> in baptisme.

                  </gap>igeth against this <hi>Part. 2. cap.</hi> 6. §. 19. Which must be examined. He layeth down as probable <hi>That the Apostles in probability did not observe any one fixed course in setling the Government of Churches, but setled it according to the severall circumstances of places and persons which they had to deal with.</hi> Though he lay not this down as a foundation of his <hi>thesis,</hi> but only as a Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of probability, yet if he be able to make it out that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles in some places did setle <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Governement, &amp; in other places Episcopall Governement, he shall gaine his poynt: And therefore his strength in this particular must be tryed.</p>
               <p>To this end he layeth down three grounds. 1. <hi>The different State, condition, quantity of the Churches planted by the Apostles. 2. The multitude of unfixed officers which Acted then with authority over the Church where they were resident. 3. The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent customes observed in severall Churches as t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> their Governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment after the death of the Apostles.</hi> As to the last of these grounds it cannot appear to be any at all: For the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Churches after the dayes of the Apostles will not prove what the practice of the Churches was, dureing the dayes of the Apostles, nor what the practice of the Apostles was, unlesse it could certanely be manifested, that these Churches did punctually follow the practice of the Apostles which he will neither affirme nor undertake to prove, unlesse he would flatly contradict himself. As to the second ground it cometh not up to be a sufficient ground for this position
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:65203:127"/>
unlesse he will prove that these unfixed officers or <hi>Evangelists,</hi> (such as <hi>Timothy</hi> &amp; <hi>Titus</hi> were as himself acknowledgeth) were proper Bishops, that is to say, were not <hi>Evangelists,</hi> but fixed officers. 2: Though the Apostle made use of them in some Churches, &amp; not in others, it will not follow that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apostles did set up distinct formes or models; for the way of setting up a model is adistinct thing from the modell itself: the modell or species of Government might be the same whether erected in a place immediately by the Apostles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or mediatly by the Evangelists at their direction. And 3. Neither the Apostles themselves, nor the Evangelists (for any thing which can be seen in Scripture) did act in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of governement, after an Episcopall manner, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctly with other Presbyters, in Churches constituted (&amp; what extraordinary course they tooke in Churches not yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted is not much to the purpose in hand, for their way of erecting a modell thus; being extraordinary, is not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily imitable.) And thus one species viz. Presbyterian is direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pointed forth.</p>
               <p>But most of the stresse lyeth on the first ground, for proving of which he layeth down two particulars. 1. <hi>That in Churches consisting of a small number of beleevers, where there was no great probability of a great increase afterwards, one single Pastor with Deacons under him were only constituted by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles for the ruleing of these Churches. 2. In Churches consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a multitude of beleevers, or where there was a probability of a great increase by preaching the Gospell; The Apostles did setle a colledge of Presbyters, whose office was partly to governe the Church already formed, and partly in labouring in the converting of more:</hi> As to this last particular it may be passed, because it speaketh nothing against the Presbyterians, they fully accord with him therein; save where he sayeth, <hi>That these two sores of elders men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, 1 Tim. 5: 17. were both preaching Presbyters, the one im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed most in preaching, and converting moe, and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served both more respect and maintenance, because of their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er burden, more abundant labours, and greater sufferings: and others most in ruling the flock already converted.</hi> And so reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:65203:127"/>
ruleing elders, as not being of divine appoyntment: But (that a word only may be spoken to it here) his glosse agreeth not to the place: for 1. This glosse maketh the <hi>ministery of the Word</hi> common to both, or else sayeth that such as ruled at home, did not preach at all, (&amp; such the Apostle would not account worthy of double honour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>,) but the Apostle maketh <hi>ruling</hi> common to both. 2. Then the maine difference betwixt these two should lye in the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> where as the Apostle maketh the difference to lye in the whole sentence, <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labouring in word and doctrine:</hi> For he sayeth not <hi>these that rule well and are</hi>

Tit.</hi> 1: 5. But enough of this, in this place.</p>
               <p>The first particular then must be a little more narrowly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined: he sayeth, <hi>That in some places at first there were noneplaced but only a Bishop &amp; Deacons,</hi> &amp; for this he citeth <hi>Clement's</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle (saying, <hi>The Apostles preaching through countreyes and cities ordained the first fruits of such as beleeved to be Bishops and Deacons.)</hi> But by <hi>Bishops</hi> here he cannot understand such Bishops, as are now spoken of, that is, such as had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over Presbyters and Churches; for himself doth abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cleare the contrary: And what can be allaidged to prove that he meaneth only one Bishop in one place, is not yet apparent, only he referreth his reader to other testimonies,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:65203:128"/>
which must also be looked upon, &amp; examined: But it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the place it self speaketh as much for one Deacon in a place as for one Presbyter, or Bishop (for both are one as himself will acknowledge) &amp; as clearly for moe Bishops as for moe Deacons in villages, or cities <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, here are as well Bishops in cities &amp; vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, as Deacons. But then he citeth <hi>Epiphanius contra Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>m Haeres.</hi> 75. saying, <hi>That at the first there were no Bishops appoynted, &amp; then the Apostle writteth to Bishops &amp; Deacons (for the Apostles could not setle all things at first) for there was a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of Presbyters &amp; Deacons, for by these two Officers, all Ecclesiastick offices might be performed; for where there was none found worthy to be a Bishop, the place remained without one, but where necessity required one, &amp; there were some found fit, some were ordained Bishops, but for want of convenient number there could be no Presbyters found out, &amp; in such places they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with the Bishop &amp; Deacons.</hi> But what can <hi>Epiphanius</hi> or any other writter in his time, do, as to the clearing of what was the practice of the Apostles (concerning which is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent discourse) must their testimony be beleeved without a word of Scripture to warrand the same? Yea must they be beleeved when they speak contrary to the word? Be it so that there was a time in which there were Presbyters &amp; Deacons, &amp; againe a time in which there were Bishops &amp; deacons, what will this say, so long as nothing is said to prove, that these <hi>Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops</hi> &amp; <hi>Presbyters</hi> were distinct officers, &amp; not one &amp; the same, as is supposed of the Bishops &amp; presbyters now under debate, all this will never prove a distinct species of Government but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes one &amp; the same, whether the presbyters be called pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, or Bishops. 3. Be it so that in some places there were only one Bishop or Presbyter &amp; deacons appoynted (of which there can no warrand be seen in scripture for scripture sayeth that there were presbyters ordained <gap reason="foreign">

Episcopall Government; so long as this one Bishop could not be a Bishop properly so called, not having presbyters under him? Or doth he think that it is inconsistent with presbyterian Government that one preaching presbyter be set over a parish or a village, &amp; that he &amp; others joyn with the presbyters one or moe of a Neighbour city, in things of common concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? or must he rule in that village independently? Mr <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet</hi> will not acknowledge this: Nor can he say that he can exerce Episcopall power: Therefore though this were granted to him the Government may still be presbyteriall. 4, How can <hi>Epiphanius</hi> say that the Apostles could not setle all things at the first? if they could not do it who could do it else? had they not the Spirit in great measure to prompt them to do what was fit &amp; expedient? either they could not get men fit to be Bishops, or a sufficient number to be presbyters; But this will suppone that at that time presbyters &amp; Bishops were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct, which <hi>Stilling fleet</hi> will not acknowledge; &amp; <hi>Epiphanius</hi> cannot give one instance of a <hi>Bishop</hi> distinct from, &amp; superiour unto <hi>preaching Presbyters</hi> setled in a Church alone with some few deacons.

There is no mention made of any change in the Apostle <hi>Paul's</hi> time; for the author mentioneth here his Epistle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> which was writen near to the end of his dayes. 3. Though there had been some change &amp; alteration even in the Apostles dayes, as to the manner of going about the work of preaching and baptizing (&amp; these are all the particulars, which the author mentioneth) &amp; some order setled thereanent, which had not been setled before, what will this speak to the matter of Government, which is the only thing now under de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate? will it follow that because there was a setled order condes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended on in preaching and baptizeing which at sirst was not followed, therefore the Apostles in some Churches erected pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Government, and in others, Episcopall? By what <hi>Medium</hi> will this consequence be proved? 4. But how
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:65203:129"/>
how shall it beleeved that things were better setled afterward then they were in the Apostles dayes; or that the practice of after ages is as obligatory as the practice of the Apostles? It is but a dream then to think, that the Apostles did not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve any setled forme in Governing Churches, but only Acted according to the principles of humane prudence, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the necessities &amp; occasions of the severall Churches which they had planted; for neither this author nor any other which he hath cited to this effect, doth prove it: And though they should all say it, we were not bound to beleeve them, seing the law &amp; the testimony showeth the contrary, as may be seen in the writings of such as plead for Presbyterian Governement, where they shew that the Church of <hi>Ierusalem Ephesus</hi> &amp; others, were Governed by the common consent of Presbyters, &amp; that the manner of the governement of all Gospell Churches mentioned in the new Testament was uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme.</p>
               <p>But he hath another thing to say against the practice of the Apostles, viz. <hi>That we cannot have that certainety of Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall practice, which is necessary to constitute a divine right.</hi> This notion he prosecuteth at great length <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. &amp; as a ground thereunto he <hi>Prefixeth §. 4. That the Apostles in the forming of Churches did observe the customes of the jewish synagogue.</hi> And thereupon proceedeth to cleare both what the Governement of the jewish synagogues was, &amp; how the forme set up in the Christian Church did correspond thereunto; all which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth the bussinesse in hand litle or nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; there fore may be passed; seing it is not very materiall to consider wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or not jewish synagogues were so Governed? &amp; whether or not the Apostles did follow that copy: for that which is now sought for is such a Government as was practised by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles; &amp; instituted, as the forme of Church Government which was to continue, &amp; such a Governement as had the stamp of divine authority, or of a divine institution; But now, no jewish Governement as such, could have this; but only such a Governement, as these, by their practice did institute, who were thereunto appoynted of God, &amp; extraordinarily called
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:65203:130"/>
&amp; qualified. And moreover if the jewish Synagogues were Governed uniformly, &amp; if the Apostles did set up a Governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Gospell Churches, in a way correspondent there unto, It will inevitably follow that the Apostles did take an uniforme way in setling the Governement of all the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, &amp; this crosseth what he said of late, &amp; confirmeth what was Answered.</p>
               <p>But leaving this. The proposition now under consideration is a question of fact the certanety of which is doubted of, as he allaidgeth, viz, what course the Apostles took in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Churches. or after what manner, did they setle a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement among them? The uncertanety of this matter of fact, he thinketh to evince by three arguments.

                     </gap> what Apostolicall practice was</hi> (which he prosecuteh largely &amp; satisfactorily From §. 16. to §. 19.) may be passed, as concerning the bussinesse in hand nothing, as to Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aus; for if they be not able to prove the practice of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, out of the sacred write, they dispaire, as much as he can do, of proving the same from humane records, &amp; that for the same reasons which he there giveth. But as for the other two reasons or grounds they must be examined.</p>
               <p>The first then is this <hi>The equivalency of the names &amp; the doubtfulnesse of their signification by which this forme should be determined—now there is a fourefold equivalency of names</hi> Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop &amp; Presbyter. 1. <hi>That both should signifie</hi> a Presbyter <hi>as.</hi> Theodor in 1. <hi>Tim. 3. 1. 2. That both should signifie</hi> a Bishop. 3. <hi>That both should signifie promiscuously some time</hi> a Bishop <hi>and sometime</hi> a Presbyter. <hi>and. 4. That the name</hi> Bishop <hi>alwayes imports a singular</hi> Bishop, <hi>but the name</hi> Presbyter <hi>doth promiscuously signifie both—equivocall words can never of themselves determine what sensethey are to be taken in—all that can be inferred from the promiscuous sense of the words, is that they may be understood only in this sense, but it must be proved that they can be understood in no other sense,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:65203:130"/>
before any one particular forme of Governement, as necessary, can be inferred from the use of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. This is a ready way to cast all scripture as unable to determine any controversy; for if adversaries may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved all these passages which are made use of against them, do carry another sense, &amp; must be otherwise interpreted, &amp; so all scripture must goe under the name of equivocall sentences, &amp; must be laid aside. 2. Presbyterians do not lay the stresse of their bussinesse upon the name; They have other things whereby to prove their poynt then either the one name, or the other; And so this doth not concerne them much. 3. The question betuixt Presbyterians &amp; their adversaries is this, whether there be such an officer as a prelat having su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority of jurisdiction over Presbyters &amp; people, &amp; sole pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of ordination, instituted by Christ; or not: &amp; not whether these two words signifie one thing or another; for it is granted by all the Episcopall party (except one who in his <hi>Annot on act</hi> 11. sayeth <hi>that there is no evidence whereby these inferiour presbyters may appear to have been brought in the Church so early.)</hi> That there were presbyters ordained in the Apostles dayes; and all the question is concerning bishops, as distinct from presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, whether or not they were ordained: &amp; Presbyterian divines do demonstrat that even in those places where the name <hi>Bishop</hi> is, no such officer can be understood. As to that which some fathers say, who writting some centuries of yeers after the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles dayes, &amp; speaking of the state of the Church in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles dayes, after the forme &amp; manner in their times, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the promiscuous use of the two names, it doth no way wrong the cause in hand, untill it be proved, that there was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed such an officer <hi>in rerum natura,</hi> &amp; this is not yet done. 4. Whatever these names may signifie is not very materiall, but what indeed they do signifie in such &amp; such places: And if there was not such an officer in the dayes of the Apostles, as a <hi>Bishop</hi> distinct from a <hi>Presbyter</hi> (as shall be supposed untill it be better proved then yet it is,) it will necessariely follow that both those names must signifie one &amp; the same thing, one &amp; the same officer viz a <hi>Presbyter.</hi> 5. To say that both these
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:65203:131"/>
names are promiscuonsly used sometime for a <hi>Bishop</hi> &amp; some time for a <hi>Presbyter</hi> if these two be distinct officers, is to lay a blot on the Spirit of God speaking in the scriptures, for by what rule shall it be known when he is speaking of the one, &amp; when he is speaking of the other? &amp; in what a mist &amp; labyrinth must all be lest, in this bussinesse, especially when the maine difficulty touching the being of one of these officers, is not removed. 6. But to put an end to this, let these few things be considered by <hi>Mr Stilling fleet.</hi> 1. Is it probable that <hi>Christ</hi> or his Apostles would institute a new &amp; distinct officer, &amp; an officer who was to continue unto the end of the world as an ordinary &amp; necessary officer, &amp; yet give him no pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar proper name, by which he might be known, &amp; every one might know when he were speaken of, especially se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the other officers in Christ's house both ordinary &amp; extraordinary have their own distinct names, whereby they are known &amp; distinguished from others.. 2. Where will <hi>Mr Stilling fleet</hi> shew that an inferiour officer was stiled &amp; called by the name, properly belonging unto a superiour officer where will he finde a <hi>Deacon</hi> stiled a <hi>Presbyter Apostle <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> or <hi>Evangelist?</hi> Where will he finde a <hi>Presbyter</hi> stiled a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Apostle</hi> or <hi>Evangelist</hi> (taking these names as restricted to be peculiar names of two extraordinary officers, &amp; not in their generall acceptation as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8, 23 &amp; <hi>Phil.</hi> 2, 25.) how can it be then that a <hi>Presbyter</hi> was called a <hi>Bishop,</hi> if there was a superiour Church officer going under that name as proper &amp; peculiar to him. 3. Is it not strange that in all the places of Scripture, where there is mention made of this <hi>Bishop,</hi> it cannot be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demonstrated that any other Church Officer is or can be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, then a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> as to <hi>Phil. 1: v.</hi> 1. it is beyond all denyall: &amp; as to <hi>Tit. 1: 7. Act.</hi> 20: 28. There the <hi>Bishops</hi> are expresly called <hi>Presbyters:</hi> And 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3: 1, 2. Is the very parallel of <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 7. In both which places the work mentioned &amp; quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, are only the work &amp; qualifications of a <hi>Pesbyter.</hi> 4. What mark will <hi>Mr Stilling fleet</hi> give to know when the spirit of God mentioning <hi>Bishops</hi> is to be understood of mere <hi>Pesbyters</hi> &amp; when he is to be understood as speaking of <hi>Bishops</hi> distinct from
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:65203:131"/>
                  <hi>Presbyters;</hi> for neither the name, nor the work, nor the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications will point out this distinction of <hi>Officers,</hi> or direct us, which of the two to understand. 5. Let Mr <hi>Stilling fleet</hi> say, whether it be not saifer to conclude an identity of offices from the identity of names, qualifications, &amp; work; then to conclude a distinction, where there is no ground for a distinction, appearing in Apostolick times? 6. Had Mr <hi>Stilling fleet</hi> once proved that there was such an officer, as a <hi>Bishop</hi> distinct from, &amp; superiour to <hi>preaching Presbyters,</hi> instituted by the Apostles, in any of the Gospell Churches, then this notion touching the promiscuous use of the two names had said something; But seing that is not done, both these names must signify, &amp; import one &amp; the same officer: And so these two names shall be synoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, &amp; not equivocall.</p>
               <p>The second thing which he allaidgeth is this <hi>The places most in controversy about the forme of governement may be understood without any apparent incongruity of either of the different formes. Ans.</hi> It is certaine they cannot be understood of both, onely the question is, of which of the two they must be understood: And all this which he sayeth will not much advantage his cause; for hence he can onely conclude, that there is a difficulty to finde out the <hi>species</hi> of Government which these places speak to; but not that there is a liberty granted to owne either of the two, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is not well known which of the two, the places cited, do most favoure. He is pleased to name some few passages, &amp; these none of the clearest for the Presbyterian cause. But to passe this piece of unfaire dealing, the passages which he mentioneth shall be examined, &amp; then some others shall be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, to which his answers will not so well suite.</p>
               <p>The first passage which he citeth is <hi>Act 11. 30. Which</hi> (sayeth he) <hi>may either be understood of the elders of the Church at Ierusalem or of the several Bishops of the Churches of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>udea. Ans.</hi> Is it credible that learned <hi>Mr Stilling fleet</hi> could satisfie himself with this answer? Doth he verily think that these elders were or could be <hi>Bishops?</hi> If so what were these Churches over which they were set? Could <hi>Ierusalem</hi> want a Bishop when the other lesser Churches of <hi>Iudea</hi> had? If <hi>Ierusalem</hi> had also a Bishop who
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:65203:132"/>
was he? He will not say that <hi>Iames</hi> was Bishop there, for <hi>Iames</hi> was an <hi>Apostle,</hi> &amp; so, far above an ordinary Bishop; where findeth he the name <hi>Presbyter</hi> in all the New Testament, taken for a <hi>Bishop</hi> distinct from a <hi>Presbyter?</hi> Or where findeth he a company of <hi>Presbyters</hi> taken for a company of <hi>Bishops?</hi> Is it not also strange that where there were so many Bishops, there should not one of them be designed by name. 2. What though there should be nothing in the place (&amp; what wonder when li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty is taken to put such glosses upon it, as cannot be confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any other like passage) that expresly excludeth the one, is not this enough, that there is no thing in all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture speaking for that one, nor any thing in that passage ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly for it? If there be no passage clearing that Bishops were instituted by <hi>Christ</hi> or his Apostles, every passage which speaketh of the governement of the Church by <hi>Presbyters,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth <hi>Bishops,</hi> if it do not expresly &amp; directly include them, as this passage doth not. But 3. Look the context &amp; this will be cleared: It was the Church of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> that sent <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>bas</hi> thither to <hi>Antioch. Ver.</hi> 22. And <hi>Agabus</hi> the Prophet who did foretell of the famine was come also from <hi>Ierusalem, Ver.</hi> 27. And so it was to the Church of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> that <hi>Barnabas</hi> was sent back againe, with this contribution; Because this was the chief Church where were many Christians: &amp; there are few plantations beside found, as yet in <hi>Iudea,</hi> that could make up Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hopricks.</p>
               <p>The next passage he citeth, is more considerable, <hi>Act. 15: v.</hi> 6. <q>[Where, he sayeth, nothing is expressed to make us know whether these were the fixed elders of that Church, or the Bishops of all the Churches of <hi>Iudea.]</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> What was said to the last, may be replyed to this also: And furth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er it was the elders of that Church unto which <hi>Paul</hi> &amp; <hi>Barnabas</hi> were sent <hi>Ver.</hi> 2. &amp; this was the Church of <hi>Ierusalem, that they should goe up to Ierusalem to the Apostles and elders.</hi> 2. When they came to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> they found the Apostles &amp; el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, there present: what could the Bishops of all <hi>Iudea</hi> be doing there at that time? If it be said, that they came togeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er upon this solemne occasion. How did they know of this
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:65203:132"/>
occasion? For the Apostles knew not of it themselves till the Commissioners from <hi>Antioch</hi> told them, <hi>Ver.</hi> 5. <q>[That there were certane of the Sect of the Pharisees arisen which beleeved saying that it was needfull to be circumcised, &amp;c.]</q> And then, <hi>Ver.</hi> 6. <q>[The Apostles &amp; Elders came together for to consider of this matter.]</q> He who can imagine that these Elders were the Bishops of the severall dioecies of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,</hi> may easily cast by the plainest &amp; fullest passages of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that can be, &amp; may imagine what he pleaseth. But to put a close to this, let that passage, <hi>Act.</hi> 16: 4. be considered, where it is said, <q>[They delivered them the decrees to be keeped which were ordained by the Apostles <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> &amp; Elders in <hi>Ierusalem,]</hi>
                  </q> or who belonged to the Church of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> or stayed there.</p>
               <p>The third passage is <hi>Act.</hi> 21: 11. of which he giveth the same dubious sense, upon as little ground as before, &amp; his conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures may receive the same answers: Only where he sayes, <hi>They might be the Elders of the severall Churches of Iudea,</hi> he seemeth to prevaricat, for the poynt of difference is not betwixt <hi>Elders</hi> &amp; <hi>Elders;</hi> But betwixt <hi>Elders</hi> &amp; <hi>Bishops,</hi> &amp; betwixt the Elders of that particular Church of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> &amp; the severall Bishops of the dioecies of <hi>Iudea:</hi> But it seemeth he blushed to name this once, &amp; therefore thought it best to put in <hi>Elders,</hi> but this was not faire dealing. Neither is his conclusion faire when he sayeth, <hi>There is no certainty of the Church of</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>how that was governed, whether by Apostles themselves, or other unfixed Elders, or only by</hi> James, <hi>who exerced his Apostleshipe most there, and thence is afterward called</hi> Bishop <hi>of</hi> Jerusalem: For the question is not whether the Church of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was governed by all the Apostles, or only by one; But whether by Presbyters in common, or by one Bishop above &amp; distinct from Presbyters: And by this conclusion he would seem to say that there were no Elders in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> at all, &amp; no Governours there, but Apostles one or moe. Moreover it is sufficiently proved by the Presbyterian divines; that the Apostles, when acting in governement together with other Elders or Officers, did not act as Apostles, but as ordinary Officers; And also
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:65203:133"/>
that <hi>Iames</hi> did not govern the Church of <hi>Ierus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> alone, as a Bishop</p>
               <p>The fourth passage which he citeth is <hi>Act.</hi> 14: 23. upon which he sayeth, <hi>That no more is imported, but that no Church wanted an Elder, but not that every Church had moe Elders. Ans.</hi> whether was this single Presbyter a Prelate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or not? If not, what is this to the present question? The governement may be Presbyteriall where one Minister is fixed to one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular flock. If he was a Prelat, where were his Presbyters un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him? 2. It is true <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

But this cannot so much as ground a probability; for it is certane the most part of his abode was at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> for full two yeers &amp; three moneths are specified <hi>Act,</hi> 19: 8, 10. &amp; the rest of the three yeers (if there be not <hi>ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>Thus it hath been showne how weak the ground is, upon which Mr <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>illing fleet</hi> walketh, &amp; how litle reason he hath to conclude his notion from these passages which he hath men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned: &amp; furder the groundlesnesse of his conceite will appear if some two or three passages of scripture be but viewed, which he hath passed by without once noticeing &amp; unto which the answers which he was pleased to give to others, will not qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drate, as. 1. That place. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. If any look thorow that epistle they shall easilie see that there were many preaching Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bysers in that one Church &amp; here <hi>Cap.</hi> 5. they are about a work of excommunication, &amp; so are endued with episcopall power. In this <hi>Chap.</hi> the Apostle speaketh to them all alongs in the plurall number, &amp; Mr <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> who is no friend to the independent way, will easily acknowledge that what is there said was spoken to the Church Governours: So then, <hi>Mr Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet</hi> must say that these Governours were Presbyters of that one Church ruleing it together <hi>communi corsilio:</hi> And that they can not so well be understood of Bish. for one Church should have but one Bishop: So then here is a place which cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:65203:134"/>
alike of both, but must of necessity be understood of a Presbytery, &amp; of a Presbytery having full Episcopall power, in the matter of jurisdiction, what <hi>Mr Stilling fleet</hi> will reply to this, can hardly be conjectured. A second passage is <hi>Phil. 1: v.</hi> 1. where mention is made of <hi>Bishops</hi> &amp; <hi>Deacons;</hi> now these Bishops, could not be <hi>Bishops</hi> properly so called in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to, &amp; as distinct from <hi>preaching Presbyters;</hi> Because of such Bishops there can be but one in one Church at once, &amp; therefore they behoved to be Presbyters endued with Episcopall power, having the thing as well as the name, &amp; Presbyters of that one Church: So that this passage cannot be equally understood of both, with any shew of reason. A third pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage is 1. <hi>Thes.</hi> 5: 12, 13, 14. Where there are some mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed who were <hi>labouring among the people,</hi> &amp; were <hi>over them in the Lord,</hi> &amp; these were to <hi>warne the unruly,</hi> &amp;c. So that in this one Church there were severall Presbyters, &amp; Presbyters endued with power of warning the unruly: <hi>Mr Stillingfleet</hi> cannot imagine, any colurable pretence whereby, without much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent incongruity, this passage may be understood of eith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the different formes. And seing this ground faileth here, we may for all which he hath said to the contrary, arrive to such an absolute certainty of that course which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles took in setling Churches. So much for this obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It may be <hi>observed;</hi> That Presbyterians have more then the practice of the Apostles, even their positive institutions, in these few particulars. 1. In ordaining &amp; instituting such &amp; such Officers, as <hi>Pastours, Doctors, Elders,</hi> &amp; <hi>Deacons,</hi> as may be seen, <hi>Rom. 12: v. 6, 7, 8, 1 Cor. 12: 28. Ephes. 4: v.</hi> 11, 12. In all which places there is no mention made of a Bishop distinct from a preaching Presbyter. If <hi>Mr Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet</hi> say, according to his principles, that there was no neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of making mention of him, particularly, because he is no distinct officer from a Presbyter, but only impowered by the rest as their Commissioner. Beside what hath been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyd to this formerly, this may be added here. That if this be truth which <hi>Mr Stillingfleet</hi> affirmeth, he hath wasted
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:65203:134"/>
much paper and paines in vaine, when he went about to prove that no certanety of the practice of the Apostles could be come at whether they did set up episcopall or Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Governement; for these should not be two distinct Governments: And he had a shorter cut for Answering all the places of scripture, then the way was which he took: Yea he might have spared his whole book, &amp; given out this one <hi>Thesis</hi> for all, viz: <q>[Though Presbyterian Governement be <hi>Iuris Divini</hi> yet the Presbyters, may lawfully intruste one of their number with some speciall piece of the exercise of jurisdiction &amp; ordination.]</q> And then he might have had more to say, upon the ground of prudence or the like, for himself, then now he hath. But it is not good to be wise above what is written, &amp; it is best wisdome &amp; pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to follow the rule of the word. But more over. 2. They have the Apostles institutions concerning the qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of these officers, as is to be seen in <hi>Paul's</hi> epistles to <hi>Timothy,</hi> &amp; <hi>Titus.</hi> 3. These officers are commanded to such &amp; such pieces of work, Some to rule, some to teach also, some to take care of the poor. 4. These officers are commanded to attend that work of theirs with all diligence, in their own proper persons, without rolling it over on others <hi>Rom.</hi> 12: 6, 7, 8. The Minister is to <hi>waite on his Ministery,</hi> &amp; he <hi>that teacheth on teaching,</hi> he <hi>that giveth is to do it with simplicity,</hi> &amp; <hi>he that ruleth is to rule with diligence.</hi> 5. In matters of discipline &amp; juridiction they are commanded to Act joyntly, for the officers of the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted to conveen together that they might deliver the incestuous person unto Satan 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5, 4, 5. So the brethen the officers of the Church of <hi>Thessalonica</hi> were exhorted to warne the unruly. Now lay all these together. Such &amp; such offic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, set to such &amp; such work, &amp; appoynted to attend the same, &amp; ordained to Act joyntly in matters of government, &amp; there is a species of Government, &amp; a species warranted by Divine institution viz: by Apostolick commands; for these positive commands are of a lasting nature till God repeale them againe. Himself giveth some <gap reason="foreign">

when positive lawes binde immutably, the first whereof men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>Part. 1. c 1. §. 6. &amp; Part. 2. c.</hi> 2. §. 2. Is usefull here viz. <hi>when the same reason of the command continueth still.</hi> Now let <hi>Mr Stilling fleet</hi> show, if he can, what reason could plead for Ministers acting collegiatly in matters of discipline then, which will not be of force now; was there lesse of the spirit then, nor is now? Or was there fewer able &amp; fit men for to be Bishops then, nor is now? Or was there lesse care to have things done orderly &amp; exactly? or shall we say that all these commands were for that age of the Church only? If so, there is an easie way found to cast all the commands &amp; injunctions of the Apostles, though they were induced with the spirit. Shall it be thought that the command given to the Church officers of <hi>Corinth</hi> to conveen &amp; to excommunicat, did binde them only, &amp; at that time? if so, there should be a wide door opened to much evil, &amp; a way prepared for lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aside all the injunctions &amp; instructions of the Apostles as now uselesse, &amp; as an almanack out of date. Enough of this consideration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obs.</hi> 7. It would seem to be a great reflexion upon <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> who was faithfull to him that appoynted him, &amp; that as a sonne &amp; so beyond <hi>Moses</hi> who was faithfull as a servant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 2, 5, 6. To say, that he hath not appoynted a stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forme of Governement in his house. <hi>Mr Stilling fleet</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth <hi>Part,</hi> 2. c. 4. §. 1. 1. <hi>That then it must be made appear that the setling of this forme was a part of his mediatory work Ans.</hi> This may easily be made to appear; for it did belong to his Kingly office, &amp; so was a part of his mediatory work, as well as his instituting of officers in his house, &amp; as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor the Government is laid on his shoulders <hi>Isa. 9. 6. And all power in heaven &amp; earth was given to him Mat.</hi> 28, 18. He addeth <hi>I grant he is King of the Church, &amp; doth Govern it out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly by his lawes, &amp; inwardly by his spirit, but shall we say that therefore any one forme of Governement is necessarie which is neither contained in his lawes nor dictated by his spirit? Ans.</hi> No, not at all, for the Government which Presbyterians do account necessary is both contained in his lawes &amp; dictated
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:65203:135"/>
by his spirit, as is showne; &amp; they reject all other formes on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly because they are not contained in his lawes, nor dictated by his spirit. He replyeth. 2. <hi>That if this correspondency hold the Church of Christ must be equally bound to all circumstances of worship Ans.</hi> The Christian liberty wherewith <hi>Christ</hi> hath made us free, should not be abridged in the least, nor should this correspondency be pressed so exactly &amp; straitly, as to make it bleed; and yet there is no necessity to grant that in nothing the correspondency will hold: It is true as to the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of actions much is left to Christian liberty now, &amp; so under the law, in severall things, much was left to the liberty of the jews. But to say that the modell of Governement should come in among circumstances is to speak without any proof or sure ground, especially when the Change of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell will be the bringing in of a new officer, which himself will not grant to be a thing left to Christian liberty. He replyeth. 3. <hi>That there is such a disparity betuixt the Gospell &amp; jewish state as will weaken the argument Ans.</hi> Of these dispari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties he nameth foure The first whereof is the same with that which went before, viz. our Christian freedome from ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es &amp; the like. But will it hence follow that Christians now must be at liberty to choose what forme of Governement they will, <hi>popish prelaticall, Erastian, independent, morellian,</hi> or <hi>Presbyterian?</hi> Must they be at liberty to choise what officers they will; Or must they be left at liberty, to cut out their work to them? It is good to stand fast in the liberty where with <hi>Christ</hi> hath made us free; but it is not good to turn that liberty unto licentiousnesse, &amp; to extend it beyond the due bounds. <hi>Mr Silling fleet</hi> would do well to have a care of the first day sabbath, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>st he let the morality of that passe with the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Church governement <hi>in specie,</hi> for his grounds will lead him sorth equally against both.</p>
               <p>The second difference is this, <hi>That the Government of the tribe of</hi> Levi was <hi>agreeable to the rest of the tribes. &amp; therefore of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument hold, Christ must prescribe a civil Government. Ans.</hi> whether the Gover<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ent of the tribe of <hi>

                     </gap>
                  </hi> was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> or not, is not very materiall; for this is certaine. <hi>Moses</hi> was faithfull
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:65203:136"/>
in the house of God ordering all things according to the will of God, So must <hi>Christ</hi> be in his own house &amp; Church, ordering all things there according to God's minde: It is not the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the state, but the Government of Christ's house which is looked after. But. 2. Had the Church under the law no Government? Where was their priests &amp; their Levites then? &amp; where was their <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> lesser &amp; greater? Sure this was distinct from the Government of other tribes; Yea even from the Government of the tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> as it was a part of the state: And as a Church they had other officers then the state had.</p>
               <p>His third difference is, <hi>That the jewes were a whole &amp; intire people when one set forme of Government was prescribed them, but the Church of Christ, was but in forming in the dayes of Christ &amp; the Apostles &amp; therefore one could not serve it then &amp; now, when whole nations are converted: A pastor &amp; deacons might serve a a city when converts are few, but cannot when increased to many congregations. Ans.</hi> This will plead for a necessity of multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying officers of the same kinde conforme to the multitude of beleevers, but will not evince a necessity of having new offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. It will plead for the enlargeing of the same <hi>Species</hi> of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; but not for the bringing in of a new <hi>Species:</hi> though the garment cut out for one in his infancy, will not serve him when growne in years: yet a garment of the same kinde of cloath will serve. 2. It is strange that when the Church was small she behoved to be ruled by a company of presbyters; but now when she is grown large, one Bishop will suffice: One would think that if the Government had been episcopall then, it should be presbyterian now; for the larger the Church is she requireth the moe Governours. 3. There is mention made of the Churches of <hi>Iudea, Galatia, Asia, Syria</hi> &amp; <hi>Cylicia;</hi> &amp; so of many large countreyes &amp; territories converted unto the faith, and why might there not such a modell of Government be fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len upon, in those large countreyes, as would suite whole Kingdomes? 4. It is sufficiently known that Presbyterian Governement will suite all Churches, be they lesser, be they larger: were there but one congregation of beleevers in a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:65203:136"/>
Presbyterian Governement will sit that litle Church: &amp; againe were there great Kingdomes &amp; nations converted the same Government would suite them, &amp; most certainly attaine the end for which it was appoynted. 5. If the forme of Church Governm. which <hi>Moses</hi> did appoynt did suite the jews both when they were in the wildernesse walkeing as an army &amp; when they were setled in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> in a formall &amp; compleat King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, &amp; where their number was multiplied, &amp; when they were under Various sorts of civil Government sometimes under <hi>Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,</hi> &amp; sometimes under <hi>Kings;</hi> shall Christ be lesse faithfull, &amp; not appoynt such a Gospell Government as will suite a greater Church as well as a lesser, &amp; suite the Church under whatsoever kinde of civil Government she may be?</p>
               <p>His fourth difference is almost the same with the second, for it is this, <hi>The jewes lived under one civil Government; but Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians under diverse formes, &amp; then as Church Government, at the first was formed according to the civil Government so should it be now. Ans.</hi> That the jewish Church Government was of the same kinde with the civill Governement is not yet proved, &amp; it cannot be yeeld<hi rend="sup">ed</hi> without probation. 2. The parallel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Christ</hi> &amp; <hi>Moses,</hi> lyeth not in this, that both did follow one immediat copy: but in this, that both did institute a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment according to God's will, &amp; such a government as he would have set up in the Church &amp; to continue in the Church so long as that polity should stand, that is to say, as <hi>Moses</hi> did appoynt a government which should unalterably endure so long as the temple, the typicall &amp; dark dispensation should stand; so Christ should appoynt a forme which should unalterably en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure so long as the new dispensation should last, that is, untill the end of the world; for Christians look for no other change. 3 One &amp; the same forme of Church Government will suite all Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es now, in all time coming, under what soever kinde of civil Government they be, as hath been already said.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obs, 8. Mr Stilling fleet</hi> is not well pleased with such as lay any weight upon the former ground mentioned viz: Christ's being obliged there unto by his office as mediator &amp; King &amp; Lord of his house; &amp; would have them rather proving that
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:65203:137"/>
Christ hath determined a forme of Governement, then that he ought so to have done. Therefore we shall shew that Christ hath so done indeed. And what the Apostles did at his command, or by vertue of the commission he gave unto them, will easily be granted to be equivalent. But to passe this, <hi>Christ</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self hath laid down the maine ground &amp; foundation of a <hi>spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> of governement in <hi>Math. 18: ver.</hi> 15, 16, 17. For there he is setting down a course, for the removing of scandalls that will fall out among his Disciples, &amp; followers, &amp; order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the matter, so that when privat meanes will not gaine the offending brother, more publick meanes must be used, &amp; he must be brought unto the Church judicature, &amp; that Church judicature hath power to excommunicat him, if so be he heare them not, as to the removing of the scandall. It is true many parties endeavour to presse these words for their own use, but it will not hence follow that therefore these words are incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent to determine any one forme; for if this ground be relevant much of the scripture should become incompetent to determine matters of faith &amp; doctine; because severall parties labour to wrest the same to their own judgment. It would be tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous here to examine the clames of all parties unto this place, &amp; the present work is only to deal with <hi>Mr Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleet,</hi> &amp; therefore only his notions concerning this place must be examined.</p>
               <p>Concerning this place then, he giveth his judgment, 2. <hi>part. cap.</hi> 5. §. 8. &amp; first he taketh the <hi>trespasses</hi> mentioned to be matters of private offence &amp; injury, &amp; not matters of <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall,</hi> &amp; his grounds are these. 1. <hi>The parallel place Luk. 17: ver. 3. is to be understood of privat injuries; because it is in the power of each privat person to forgive them. Ans.</hi> So said <hi>Erastus</hi> before him but after narrow search it will be found that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving mentioned in the Text <hi>Math.</hi> 18. is a desisting from any further prosecution of the bussinesse, &amp; a forgiving which must not be granted untill the brother be gained: But whether the offending brother be gained or not, all private injuris must be forgiven him, &amp; none must keep up a Spirit of revenge against him: And therefore these <hi>trespasses</hi> must be matters of
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:65203:137"/>
                  <hi>Scandall,</hi> which, unlesse the offending brother be gained, must be prosecuted untill the yondmost step be used. 2. He say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>It appears from the next words of Peter, ver.</hi> 20. This is another of <hi>Erastus's</hi> shifts: But for answere. It will not appear till <hi>Mr Stillingfleet</hi> first cleare that there is such a connexion betwixt these verses, as will undoubtedly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strat that one purpose is to be understood in Both. But com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators shewe the matter to be otherwise, &amp; indeed there is nothing that can so much as ground a probability of such a connexion here, unlesse it be these words, <hi>Then came</hi> Peter <hi>to him,</hi> but whosoever shall look on <hi>Luk. 8: v.</hi> 19. shall have the like, thus, <hi>Then came to him his mother,</hi> &amp;c. And yet this was not immediatly after what was said before, as will appear when compared with other Evangelists: And so since it is not certaine that this was immediatly after the former pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, no reason can be given to evince the identity of these purposes. 3. He sayeth, <hi>If it were meant of any scandalous sin it might so fall out that matters of scandal should be brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Church, when only one person knowes it. Ans.</hi> It is not said that every such scandall or trespasse whereof only one is conscious should be brought in publick, but that more noture scandalls ought to be brought before Church judicatures, when more privat admonitions will not gaine the offender.

Ans.</hi> 1. The word <hi>Church</hi> is not usually so taken in the New Testament, &amp; the Hebrew words <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="242" facs="tcp:65203:138"/>
called together by the command of a Magistrat. 2. <hi>Christ</hi> sayeth <hi>tell the Church</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp; so directeth them to a fixed standing company. 3. That <hi>pudefacere coram multie</hi> being the same with, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2: 6 <hi>the censure of many</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth this; For that censure was by a Church judicature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veened in the name of the <hi>Lord Iesus</hi> to take course with a scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous person, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. Againe 4. No commentator tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the words so, only <hi>Grotius</hi> &amp; other <hi>Erastians</hi> put such a glosse upon them. 5. <hi>Christ's</hi> scope is to have the offending brother gained, &amp; not to have matters of fact which are questionable, cleared. 6. If this be the meaning of the word <hi>Church</hi> what shall be the sense &amp; meaning of these words, <hi>Let him be unto thee as a heathen man &amp; a Publican?</hi> He answereth, <hi>Tho mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is look upon him as an obstinat refractary creature, &amp; meddle no more with him, then with a heathen &amp; a publican.</hi> And is this all the punishment which the offender must meet with: Who gave privat men this power to passe such a sentence? But 2. This must be a Church sentence because it is added, <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever you shall binde on earth, shall be bound in Heaven, &amp;c.</hi> To this he replyeth, <hi>That the meaning is, it is an evidence, that his sin is bound upon him, &amp; that he is lyable to punishment.</hi> But how is his sin bound upon him, or how is he made lyable to punishment? There must be something done on earth, which God must ratify in Heaven, &amp; on earth there is none to do any thing, but either the pursuer himself, or the select company: It cannot be the pursuer, for that were a dreadful &amp; intolerable slavery, to subjecte every man to the lust of his enemy &amp; pursuer. If it be the select company, how or whence have they this power? If they be cloathed with authority, then are they a judicature, &amp; this is the thing pleaded for. And thus, it appeareth that scandals are here understood, &amp; that this Church is a Church judicature, notwithstanding of all which <hi>Mr Still.</hi> hath said to the contrary, which is but the very same, which others had said before him, &amp; which was sufficiently answered by worthy &amp; learned <hi>Mr Gillespy</hi> in his <hi>Aarons rod blossoming</hi> though he will not so much as once take notice of his replyes. The ancients
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:65203:138"/>
did so understand the place particularly <hi>Orig. Tract.</hi> 6. in <hi>Mat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that it may be cleared how there is a foundation here laid down for a way of removing of scandals by Church officers <hi>in communi</hi> associated together in a judicature, &amp; so how there is a way laid down for presbyterian Government, let those parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars be considered. 1. From the beginning of the chapt, the Lord is speaking of scandals, &amp; first of scandals given, as is clear, <hi>v.</hi> 6: 8, 9. &amp; after he hath used some arguments to presse his followers to beware of that evill, he cometh <hi>v.</hi> 15. with an <gap reason="foreign">

They are <hi>Brethren,</hi> or Church members with whom this course must be taken. 2. The offending brother is to be rebuked or convinced of his fault <gap reason="foreign">

Hence. 2. It would be considered that the Christian's scope in this bussinesse should be to gaine the man's soull, &amp; for this cause he is to assay all calme, peaceable gaineing, &amp; private meanes, to bring the offending brother to conviction, &amp; acknowledgment of his fault; &amp; so first speak to him alone, &amp; then take some others with him to be witnes both of his Christian carriage towards him, in desireing to have him gained, &amp; of his unwillingnesse to be gained; that so they may bear witnesse of both, unto the Church judicature. 3. When pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat means do not worke, he is to be delated unto the Church judicature; for the person offended must tell the Church: What Church? He must tell <hi>that Church</hi> unto which the witnesses will be usefull, &amp; that is, a judicature; for to that, witnesses have a relation. <hi>That Church</hi> which is able to convince if any

And when this Church judicature can not get him convinced, they must passe a sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence upon him, &amp; this sentence is the sentence of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, as learned Mr <hi>Gillespy</hi> hath abundantly shewed <hi>Aaron's rod. book 3. c. 2. &amp;</hi> 3. Hence it is clear. 5. That here is set downe the way of taking away Church scandalls, by inflicting Church censures: And this by Christ's appoyntment is not to be done by any one person, but by the Church officers <hi>in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muni</hi> collegiatly; for it was never heard of to this day, either in sacred or prophane writtings that one man was called a <hi>Church</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And this is a good <hi>basis</hi> for Government yea &amp; for presbyterian Government or the Government of the Church <hi>communi consilio presbyterorum.</hi> &amp; here there is not only a foundation for graduall appeals, [as himself confesseth here: though <hi>part. 2. cap.</hi> ult §. 8. he would say that presbyterians, found their <hi>subordination of courts,</hi> Upon the principles of humane prudence] for Church censures, &amp; for the lawfull use of excommunication, as he confesseth also; But also for the <hi>species</hi> or modell of Government; Or for the manner of the constitution of the judicatures, which should excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat &amp; take notice of Church scandalls; for it is called <hi>the Church,</hi> &amp; so cannot be meaned of a prelat who is no where so called, and yet arrogateth to himself all the power of juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Mr Stilling fleet</hi> hath two arguments whereby he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureth to prove that <hi>Christ</hi> did never intend to institute any one forme of Government in the Church, <hi>part. 2. c.</hi> 4. §. 4. 5, 6. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This is a great undertaking and his arguments must needs
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:65203:139"/>
be very strong, but whether so or not, the reader may judge.</p>
               <p>The summe of the first is this <hi>If there be any such institution of Christs, as a standing law, it must either be expressed in direct termes, which cannot here be showne: Or deduced by a necessary consequence; and no consequences can make new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions but only apply one to particular cases; And then the obligation of what is drawne by a necessary consequence, must be expressed in scripture. Ans.</hi> It hath been showne that the practice of the Apostles was for a forme of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and from their practice, a law may, by necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry consequence, be drawne, considering their place, &amp; office<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how they were sent forth to plant Churches, &amp; to set up offic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers &amp; to appoynt unto each of them their proper work, &amp;c. And for this cause were endued with extraordinary qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions &amp; assistence, confirming their commission by many signes &amp; wonders: And this carryeth an obligation in its bosome. There hath been showne also a standing law of Christ's, from which a forme of Governement may be deduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, a standing law, about the removing of scandals which will found a <hi>species</hi> of Governement by Church officers in common, as well as appeals, Church censures, &amp; excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, &amp; from thence there is an obligation for the one, as well as for the rest. 2. But if all this will not satisfie, let <hi>Mr Stilling fleet</hi> satisfie himself with the standing obligation of the moralitie of the first day Sabbath, &amp; he shall with all satisfie himself as to the standing obligation of the moralitie of a <hi>species</hi> of Church Governement: He can produce no law for the first day Sabbath, but a law deduced by necessary consequence (without any obligation expressed in scripture concerning that which is so drawn by consequence) &amp; if this be enough in the case of the first day Sabbath, why not also in the case of Governement: If he say in the bussinesse of the Lord's day there was only an application of an institution, to a particular case. It is <hi>Ans.</hi> So is it in the matter of Church Governement, for there was a law for a Governement <hi>in genere,</hi> &amp; this law drawn by consequence, from the practice of the
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:65203:140"/>
Apostles &amp; primitive Church, is but an application of that generall to a particular <hi>species</hi> of Governement.</p>
               <p>His second arg. is this <hi>All the standing lawes respecting Church Governement, are equally applyable to severall formes Ans.</hi> Are they applyable to the <hi>hierarchie,</hi> to <hi>Erastianisme,</hi> to <hi>independen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> &amp; to <hi>Morellianisme:</hi> Or only to <hi>Presbytery</hi> &amp; <hi>Prelacy?</hi> If only to these two, then all other formes but one of these two are utterly excluded, &amp; there is no more liberty left save to make choise of one of these. But what if this ground of his shall not hold? He referreth all the lawes to these three heads <hi>The 1. Head is the qualifications of the persons for the office of Governement, &amp; so citeth, 1 Tim. 3, 1, to 8. Tit. 1, 5, to 10. Ans.</hi> And may it not be said, useing his own words, <hi>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>atis mutandis,</hi> that all these &amp; the rest, are equally required as necessary in <hi>a Pope,</hi> in a <hi>Patriarch,</hi> &amp;c. As well as in a <hi>Bishop</hi> or <hi>Presbyter:</hi> Yea every one may invent a number of new officers &amp; defend them with this, that all these qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations agree to them. The 2. Head is. <hi>The precepts require<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a right management of the work, &amp; citeth, Act. 20: 28. 2 Tim. 4: 2. &amp; 2: 2. 1 Tim. 5: 19, 21, 22. Heb. 13: 17. Tit.</hi> 1: 5. And addeth <hi>there is no precept in all these Epistles to Timothy &amp; Titus prescribeing whether, they should Act solely, or only as</hi> Consul in Senatu. <hi>Ans.</hi> But if the precepts be such &amp; require such a management &amp; such work, as can not, with any possibility, in any tolerable manner, be obeyed &amp; perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by officers under such a forme, then it cannot be left to the will of men to set up such a forme, &amp; so is the case here. The precepts are not applyable unto prelats: Is one man able to exhort, reprove &amp; watch over a whole dio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>cy his alone, seing he in all probability shall never see their faces? (And as for delegation of Church power <hi>Mr Stilling fleet</hi> himself sayeth <hi>Part. 2. c. ult. §. 8. Pag.</hi> 414. That there is not the least footstep of it, either in scripture or antiquity.) Is it possible that one man, can in any tolerable manner, obey these com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, &amp; watch over such a number, over which, Two or Three hundered ministers could not get well watched? God layeth not utter impossibilities on his officers. So then seing
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:65203:140"/>
these precepts are not applyable unto any other forme, then Presbyteriall, his Argument falleth to the ground; Seing it is not imaginable that one man can rule such a numerous people, &amp; watch over them by discipline, over whom fifteen or sixteen Presbyteries, each of them consisting of fifteen or sixteen Ministers, &amp; as many ruling elders (beside the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent number of ruling elders which each particular congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation had) were set, &amp; had all work enough &amp; more then they could well overtake. But. 2. What will he do with that command, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. given to the elders of that Church to conveen together for an Act of discipline? Doth not that command concerne Gospell Churches now, as much as any of these precepts in the Epistles to <hi>Timothie</hi> or <hi>Titus?</hi> And how is it imaginable that it can be applyable unto one man? Sure then this command is not equally applyable to both formes; For a precept given to a collegiat body, to meet together, is not applyable to one single person. The 3. Head is <hi>generall rules, such as these, that none preach without a call, Heb. 5: 2. Rom. 10, 14. That offenders be censured, that complaints b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> made to the Church in case of scandall, that all be done decently in order, &amp; to edification. Ans</hi> Well then if, it be a standing rule that complaints be made to the Church, it is a standing rule that there should be a fixed Church to receive these complaints, &amp; all the question is whether this fixed Church which can take notice of complaints &amp; inflict Church censures, &amp; excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, can as well be understood of a prelat, as of a body of Church officers incorporated? And if <hi>Mr Stilling fleet</hi> can be able to show that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is or may be taken for one single person, then his notion will be more able to stand; But if not, of necessity it must fall to the ground.</p>

It is worth the considering how weighty a bussi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse the matter of the Governement of the Chuch is, &amp; of what great consequence it is to have it modelled aright: For experience hath made it appear, how much more effectuall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for keeping of the Church of Christ pure from errour &amp; heresy, &amp; for beareing downe of Prophanity, &amp; for promoving of the
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:65203:141"/>
work of Godlinesse in power; one <hi>species</hi> or forme is, then another: And this may speak very much for the Lord's keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that in his own hand &amp; not leaving it unto any Prince or Pastor to determine what shall be the <hi>species</hi> of Governement: Especially considering with what byasses &amp; by-respects, the most of men are ready to be carryed, &amp; how readyall are to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell Church Governement so as may most suite their own ends, &amp; serve most to make them great in a world. And hence it hath been seen that when men leave the simplicity of the Gospell, &amp; the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But their own base ends: And when men will be wise above what is written, &amp; follow their own notions &amp; devices God giveth them up to delusions, &amp; to more strange phancies. And sad experience hath proved how dangerous it is to depart from the rule of the word, in matter of discipline; for by this meanes, it came to passe, that the Church did not only get <hi>Bishops,</hi> distinct from, &amp; superiour unto, <hi>Presbyters;</hi> but also <hi>Metropolitans;</hi> &amp; after these <hi>Primats,</hi> &amp; at length <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> &amp; finally the <hi>Pope.</hi> They followed not the rule of the word, but thought that they were lest at liberty, as <hi>Mr Stilling fleet</hi> doth sadly make out <hi>Part. 2. c.</hi> 7. &amp; would have the Chuch as pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous, as the state, &amp; so made the state Governement their copie: And therefore as there was one Emperour so there behoved to be one <hi>universall Bishop</hi> &amp; <hi>Pope,</hi> whom the world had never seen; had not this notion of <hi>Mr Stillingfleets</hi> been in their head, viz. that they might order the matter of Church Governement as they pleased best: &amp; though <hi>Mr Stillingfleet</hi> make use of this as a confirmation of his notion, yet it is such a proof of it, as may make all tender hearted protestants trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at it &amp; reject it, as being the very thing which raised up <hi>Antichrist.</hi>

Could this learned man fall upon no way to cure the bleeding wounds of the Church, but such a way, as in some degree &amp; measure is a putting the crown off the head of <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> who is head of the Church, &amp; the scepter out of his hand? for to say that he hath not setled the Governement of his own house by appoynting his own officers, &amp; appoynting each of them to their own work, is to say, he doth not acte the part of a King &amp; Governour in the Church which is his Kingdom, &amp; of how dangerous consequence this is, himself may easily perceive.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obs.</hi> 12. It is likewise strange that this learned man should have made choise of such an opportunity &amp; occasion, wherein to vente his notion, for in so doing he hath no way consulted the good &amp; edification of the Church. Because he might well have known that by his book the higher powers of the land would have been much encouraged, to set up the former prelaticall Government, which had occasioned so much persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto the truely godly, so much opposition to piety, &amp; to the work of grace: &amp; so he might well have expected to see all these evil consequences natively springing up againe, &amp; to see the Church of God decaying as much, if not more, then ever; for that is a Governem. which destroyeth the very ends of
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:65203:142"/>
Government, because no man were he never so good could governe the Churches after that manner to edification: He might easily see that one man could not watch over, in all the duties of a watch man, so many thousands, or rather hunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eds of thousands, as by that Government he would be set over. It is true he adviseth to have lesser dioeceses but still his <hi>thesis</hi> standeth, &amp; many will read &amp; ponder his <hi>thesis,</hi> &amp; the drift &amp; scope of his book, that will never value or regaird these few lines of cautions or of advice, which he setteth down in the end of his book. He might well have known that the setting up of that Governement would have been (as he may now see with his eyes) matter of joy &amp; Gladnesse unto all the prophane rabl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> in the land, &amp; matter of lamentation &amp; grief unto the godly &amp; pious. He might well have known that by that govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, godly pious &amp; conscientious able Ministers of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, should be persecuted &amp; thrust to the door, &amp; prophane lazy &amp; every way unfit men should be put in the Ministery, who can do nothing else but read the service book &amp; a homily. He might well have known that by that governement such as were no Church officers should have the management of disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, such as <hi>Chancelours</hi> &amp; their assistants. Yea he might well have known that if that government had been set up againe, the whole work of reformation should be demolished &amp; cast to ground, as he may see it done to day, &amp; his eye may affect his heart, if he be a kindly son of <hi>Zion,</hi> &amp; a lover of the work of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation which God owned &amp; carryed on wonderfully to the Amazement of all: &amp; might not these things have deterred this learned man from venting his notions, when he might as easily have seen, as he might have opened his eyes, that the consequences thereof, should have been bitter lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; wo to the poor Church of <hi>Christ</hi> in <hi>Britaine</hi> &amp; <hi>Irland?</hi> &amp; what he can pretend to counter vaile this damage is not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable: For all his pretensions of peace &amp; union evanish at the first appearance of these destructive, &amp; irremediable incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences. And finally it is yet more wonderfull &amp; strange how this learned man hath been so bewitched &amp; blinded with his own phancies, as to be in paine untill he were delivered of
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:65203:143"/>

His principles will not suffer him to say that Presbyterian governement is utterly unlawfull, &amp; that Episcopall governement is necessary: &amp; his learning will soon discover a validity in a Covenant about things not sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, though not absolutely necessary: &amp; his piety will grant that conscience should be made of such oathes: And now when the Kingdomes were under the oath of God to set up a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment most agreable to the Word of God; And to endeavour the extirpation of Prelacy, could there be a more unseasonable time for venting this his notion, touching the indifferencie &amp; lawfulnesse of either Presbyterian or Prelaticall? For suppone his notion were a truth, of what use could it be now, when the Churches hands were bound up, by a solemne vow &amp; Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant from following their liberty? Sure his disputing so much for the liberty of the Church in such a case, at this time, sayeth that in his judgment the oath of God is of no value, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise at least he would have casten in this clause of exception some where, &amp; so have stated the question as a case in <hi>Utopia,</hi> if so be it was as a fire within him that could not be keeped in. And now indifferent readers may judge whether <hi>intentio operit</hi> (I shall not say <hi>operantis)</hi> was union, peace &amp; edification. To teach people to break Covenant with God, &amp; to null their oaths &amp; vowes, is no way to the good &amp; edification of the Church; Such an union by perjury, will be nothing else but
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:65203:143"/>
a sinfull conspiracy; Peace in such away, will be but dreadfull security when the judgments of God are at hand: And such edification is nothing but destruction. But it seemeth his si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in the matter of the Covenant all alongs, sayeth that in his judgment, the obligation of the Covenant is null, &amp; so this <hi>weapon-salve</hi> of his, must be strong, that will eat thorow the bones of a Covenant, but because it is so dangerous &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive unto the substantials &amp; vitals of Religion, it is the lesse to be valued, whatever vertue he allaigeth it hath for cureing wounds in the flesh. Did he think that tender Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians would get the Gordian knot of a Covenant oath &amp; vow so easily cut as to think themselves at liberty to choose what forme of governement they pleased? Or if he did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suppose this, of what use, did he think his book would be? Though it were to be wished that this learned man had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed his talent more for him who gave it; Yet seing he would not forbear the publishing of his notions &amp; conceptions, he might have spoken his minde concerning the obligation of the <hi>solemne League &amp; Covenant:</hi> For so long as that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant standeth in force, his notion will evanish as a cloud with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out raine.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Such reasons or objections as are allaidged for tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp; against refuseing of the oath of alleagiance, as it is called, Answered.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BEfore any other particular be entered upon, or this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the oath, which is called (though falsly) the oath of alleagiance, passed from, there are some few objections which would seem to militate against the refuseing to swear &amp; subscribe the oath, as it was tendered, which must be rolled out of the way; And these are either such as concerne the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill part, &amp; so seem to weaken the grounds of scrupling at the oath upon that account, which were laid downe <hi>Sect.</hi> 10, &amp; 11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or such as concerne the Ecclesiastick part, &amp; so seem to weaken the grounds of scrupleing at the taking of the oath upon that account, which were mentioned &amp; prosecuted <hi>Sect.</hi> 12, &amp; 13.</p>
               <p>First then as to the civill part it will be <hi>objected.</hi> 1. That there was no ground of scrupleing at taking of the oath upon that account. Because it was but the acknowledging of that very power, which did properly belong to him before, &amp; which former Parliaments had recognosced as his due, viz. the 18. <hi>Parliament</hi> of King <hi>Iames</hi> the <hi>V I.</hi> which did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge <hi>his Soveraigne Autherity, Princely Power, Royall Prerogative, &amp; Privilege of his Crown over all Estates, persons &amp; causes whatsomever. Ans.</hi> This Objection was sufficiently obviated above, <hi>Pag.</hi> 126. where it was showne that these were but Parliamentary flourishes &amp; complements, grounded upon personall qualifications: And indeed the act seemeth to raise this structure upon his Maj. being put in possession, as the righteous inheritour, of the famous &amp; renowned Kingdomes, of <hi>England, France &amp; Irland</hi> which far surpasse the wealth power &amp; force of the dominons of his progenitours Kings of <hi>Scotland,</hi> &amp; thereby having a greater increase of care &amp; burden, &amp; with
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:65203:144"/>
all upon his extraordinary graces, most rare &amp; excellent ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, where, with he was endued for the discharge of that trust. Now any man of understanding may see that the increase of his extensive power &amp; authority, or of personall qualifications, is no sufficient ground for the increase of his intensive power, or for the enlargeing of the privileges of the crowne. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over it is said expresly in the act that they <hi>ratifie approve &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually confirme the same, as absolutely, amply, &amp; freely, in all respects &amp; considerations, as ever his Maj. or any of his ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yall progenitours, Kings of Scotland in any time by gone, posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, used &amp; exercised the same.</hi> Whence it appeareth that they gave no new power, only they did recognosce what he &amp; his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitours had before. Now, as was showne above, neither he nor any of his progenitours had such a supremacy over parliaments, as is now allaidged to belong unto the crown: For as to that first <hi>act parl. 8. Anno</hi> 1584. it was showne above <hi>Pag.</hi> 125. how notwithstanding of the supremacy there granted unto the King, the privileges of Parliament remaine intire, as they had been continued past all memory of man, without any altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or diminution whatsomever: And after this <hi>Anno</hi> 1587. in the 11. <hi>Parl. act.</hi> 33. the ancient order, dignity &amp; integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the parliament is restored, &amp; particularly <hi>act.</hi> 40. the King doth faithfully promise to do or command nothing which may directly or indirectly prejudge the liberty of free voteing of the Estates of Parliament.</p>
               <p>But 2. It will be <hi>objected,</hi> That all this supremacy was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by the <hi>Parliament 21. Anno</hi> 1612. when the Acts of the Assembly at <hi>Glasgow Anno</hi> 1610. were ratified, among which this was one, that Ministers should swear the same oath which was tendered by this Parliament, &amp; which is there set down. <hi>Ans.</hi> It is true it was appoynted by that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Assembly that Ministers at their entry, or admission to the Kirk should, <hi>Testify &amp; declare, that the King was the only supreme Governour of the realme as well in matters Spirituall &amp; Ecclesiasticall, as in things temporall, &amp;c.</hi> And it is true this Parliament did ratify &amp; approve this deed, so that it had the force of a law. But 1. There is a great difference betwixt
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:65203:145"/>
such a civill sanction as this is, &amp; an other Act of Parliament, other Acts stand in force untill they be repealed, but, when the Church constitution, which is the ground &amp; <hi>Basis</hi> of the civill sanction, ceaseth, the sanction ceaseth, &amp; the Act perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>, without any formall repeall: The Act ratifying &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveing the deed of a Church judicature, standeth in force no longer, then the deed of the Church judicature standeth in force, &amp; the deed of a Church judicature may be altered without any respect had unto the civill sanction, or notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that the civill sanction is not formally removed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the civill sanction did follow &amp; depend upon the Church Act, &amp; the Church Act doth not depend upon the civill san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. 2. It is not incumbent unto a Church judicature to determine the limites of the King's civill supremacy, far lesse to determine the same in the first place: &amp; this pretended Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly was more anxious about the King's Ecclesiastick suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, then the civill, &amp; it was his supremacy in Church matters which was here intended by them, &amp; approved by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And therefore it is added, <hi>And that no forraigne Prince, State nor Potentat hath or ought to have any jurisdiction, power, superiority, preheminence or authority Ecclesiasticall or Spirituall.</hi> 3. What ever civill supremacy may be supposed to be here inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, there is no supremacy over Parliaments acknowledged; But any civill power that is here recognosced as his due, is in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to forraigne Princes, States, or Potentats, &amp; not to Parliaments within the Kingdom. If it be said that the oath tendered by this <hi>Parliament, Anno</hi> 1661. being every way correspondent unto that oath which is recorded <hi>Parliament 21. Anno<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 1612. can import a recognosceing of no more civill power then that <hi>Anno</hi> 1612. &amp; therefore might lawfully have been sworne. It is replyed. That the oath <hi>Anno</hi> 1661. is more expresse for civill power &amp; supremacy, then that <hi>An.</hi> 1612. But if there had been no more, then the words of the oath <hi>Anno</hi> 1661. there had not been very great ground of scrupleing at the taking thereof upon the account of the civil part: for it is not the words of the oath, that ground that scruple upon that account, so much as the glosse put upon the words, by their other acts
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:65203:145"/>
particularly by the act for acknowledging his Maj. prerogativ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es which as a commentary, explaineth what they meane by his being supreme governour over states civil, &amp; in all causes civil: Now the like of this was not done by the parliament <hi>Anno</hi> 1612. Or any other before or since that time, till this parliament <hi>Anno</hi> 1661. which hereby hath put another glosse upon the civil part of the oath then ever was done before.</p>
               <p>But. 3. It will be <hi>objected</hi> May not Parliaments give more civil power unto the King then he had before &amp; so enlarge even <hi>intensivè</hi> the privileges &amp; prerogatives of the crown &amp; so denude themselves of that in whole or in part, which did formerly appertaine unto them: And when the Parliament hath done this &amp; annexed such &amp; such power unto the crowne, can it be unlawfull for privat subjects to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that the King hath indeed so much power. <hi>Ans.</hi> in poynt of law it will be a very great question, whether Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments who are but trustees intrusted by the people, whose commissioners they are, &amp; virtually if not expresly bound to maintaine their rights &amp; privileges, may betray their trust, &amp; give away the iust &amp; ancient privileges of Parliament &amp; there with the just &amp; ancient liberties of the people. It will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>great question if they at their own hand, may alter the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall lawes of the land, without the consent of these whose commissioners they are. And it will be a greater que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion in law; if this Parliament might have sold or given away the privileges of Parliament, &amp; liberties of the people, seing so much in poynt of law may be objected against its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a free Parliament, if the want of freedome of election in shires &amp; brughs, if prelimitation, if the election of such as were not capable, by the foundamentall constitution of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp; practice of the Kingdome, &amp; other informalities, of that kinde, may have any place or weight in the anulling of Parliaments. But. 2. In poynt of conscience, it is clear that Parliaments may not now give away &amp; according to their pleasure dispone of the rights &amp; privileges of Parliament, for in the third article of the league &amp; covenant, all the people of the land, &amp; Parliaments among the rest, are sworne
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:65203:146"/>
to maintaine in their severall places &amp; capacities; &amp; so Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in their Parliamentary capacitie, the rights &amp; privileg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of Parliament. 3. Though the Parliament not with standing of the bonde of the covenant, should denude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of their privileges; yet now seing every particular mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Kingdome is sworne, according to his place, &amp; sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to maintaine the rights &amp; privileges of Parliament, they may not assent unto such a deed of the Parliament, &amp; by their oath &amp; subscription, approve of such a wrong; for that is the least that private persons, who desire to minde &amp; make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of the oath of God, can do, at such a time, viz. to refuse to give an expresse, clear &amp; positive assent, unto such a wrong done to the rights, &amp; privileges of Parliament, contrary to the covenant. But 4. All this is to little or no purpose; for there is not the least syllabe in all the Acts of this Parliament which doth import any new deed of gift, but all alongs they speak of these prerogatives as formerly inherent in the crown yea as essentiall to it, &amp; hence it is, that they condemne the actings of the Parliaments &amp; Kingdome of <hi>Scotland,</hi> these many years by gone, because done in such away as was an actuall &amp; insolent (as they say) incroachment &amp; invasion upon the privileges &amp; prerogatives of the crowne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 4. The acknowledging of the prerogative is dist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inct from the oath of allegiance &amp; therefore seing they were not put to take that acknowledgement, they could not refuse the oath upon the account of these consequences contained in the acknowledgement. <hi>Ans.</hi> So is the <hi>Declaration</hi> dated <hi>Sep.</hi> 2, 1662. Set down as distinct from the <hi>Acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> &amp; yet who ever sweareth &amp; subscribeth the <hi>Acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> doth sweare &amp; subscribe the <hi>Declaration</hi> upon the matter: so is it here, who ever taketh the oath of alleagiance doth upon the matter take the acknowledgem. also; for it is not possible to see any discrepancy betwixt them, save such as is betwixt the text &amp; the commentary; for the acknowledgm. is nothing else upon the matter, then an explication or <hi>Exegesis</hi> of the oath, &amp; in the acknowledgem. the same thing is said &amp; assirmed in plaine full &amp; clear tearmes, which is but in generall affirmed in the oath.
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:65203:146"/>
By their Acts they declare what things they account privileges of the crowne, &amp; all these they comprehend under his supremacy, &amp; so in their account his supremacy over all persons, &amp; the prerogatives royall, or privileges of the crowne, are all one, Therefore they could not acknowledge this supremacy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they could not acknowledge the prerogatives royall: See this objection further answered above, <hi>Pag.</hi> 168.</p>
               <p>In the next place, there are objections of another nature, which must be answered; as. 1. <hi>Obj.</hi> Such as refuse this oath of alleagiance declare that they are not dutyfull &amp; loyall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, which Ministers &amp; Christians ought not to do <hi>Ans.</hi> It hath been showne at the beginning of the tenth Section, what diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there is betwixt this oath, &amp; the oath of alleagaince, &amp; there is no Minister or Christian who would scruple at the tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the pure oath of alleagiance: Yea they would account themselves obliged to take the same, if there were any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity or just suspition of disloyalty in them, which might occasion the same. King <hi>Iames</hi> in his book called <hi>God &amp; the King</hi> sheweth that those treacherous persones, who occasioned the frameing of the oath of alleagiance, were the Pope's bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy emissaries following the principles of <hi>Rome</hi> &amp; practiseing unparalleled treacherie against King, Queen, &amp; Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, among whom, none will have the fore head to reckon such as did now refuse the oath, as it was tendered. It is the supremacy in Church &amp; state, which only was scrupled at, &amp; the acknowledging of this supremacy is no part of alleagiance; for one may acknowledge, his father to be his father though he should not say that he hath power, as a father, over his soul &amp; conscience: one may acknowledge the King of <hi>Britane,</hi> lawfull King of his dominions though he should not acknowledge him to have as much dominion &amp; power over them, as the great <hi>Turk</hi> usurpeth over his dominions: And therefore letnone so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret that passage of the <hi>Apology</hi> for the ministers of <hi>England. pag.</hi> 2. Where they prove that, they cannot be, challenged as guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Laese Majestie,</hi> because they acknowledge that the <hi>King is defender of the faith in all causes, &amp; the supreme head &amp; Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; over all persons as well ecclesiastik as civil,</hi> as if they
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:65203:147"/>
would assert that all in <hi>Scotland</hi> who do refuse this oath &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement, were guilty of <hi>Laese Majesty,</hi> merely upon the account of their refuseing of the oath, seing, as hath been showne, their case &amp; the case of <hi>Scotland</hi> is not every way the same, &amp; though they give out this as an evidence of their loyalty, yet they do not pitch upon it as <hi>proprium quarto modo</hi> unto a true loyal subject.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Obj.</hi> Will you allow his Maj. no power in Church mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. <hi>Ans.</hi> yes., Even all that power which the first confession of the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> doth allow, viz. <hi>tho conservation, &amp; purgation of religion, the maintenance of the true religion,</hi> &amp; <hi>the suppressing of idolatry and superstition</hi> as also all that which the later confession concluded by the Assembly of divin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es at <hi>Westminster</hi> doth allow: As also as much as sound reformed divines grant unto him, according to the word of God: He hath power over the <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>3. <hi>Obj.</hi> Why then was this oath refused seing no more was required thereby? <hi>Ans.</hi> More, yea much more was requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as appeareth by what hath been said, &amp; cleared from their Acts &amp; actings, especially from their refuseing of the sense given in by these <hi>Ministers</hi> who were detained so long prisoners in the Tolbooth &amp; thereafter banished, which was large enough, &amp; possibly larger then some of these who gave it, afterward upon second thoughts would approve: It is beyond questioning, that this Parliament giveth unto the King by vertue of this prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative &amp; as annexed to the crown far more then ever the confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of faith of that Chuch or any other protestant reformed Church, did give. And as they give, so he taketh more, as might be evidenced by his letter unto the Archbishop of <hi>York</hi> if it were now at hand.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Obj.</hi> But whatever they assume to themselves it is not

                  </gap> put to affirme, that so much power doth belong unto him, &amp; the oath tendered hath not so much in it, <hi>in terminis, Ans.</hi> When an oath is contrived in such generall &amp; comprehensive termes, as may take in much &amp; when there is no other way to finde out the iust latitude &amp; meaning of it; but by their Acts &amp; actings who tender it, it is of much concernment to know, what sense their actions will put upon it, for by their actions, the true sense must be learned: For it is a received &amp; known principle, that oaths must be taken according to their known sense &amp; meaning of the words, who tender the same; because oaths were first invented for their security, &amp; therefore whosoever would deal honestly &amp; Christianly in taking an oath, must take it in the very sense that it is understood in by such as tender it: Otherwise the holy name of God shall be taken in vaine, &amp; the takers of the oath shall deal deceitfully in frustrating the end of the oath, &amp; the designe of the tenderers thereof To take an oath <hi>Quatenus, Eatenus,</hi> in fo far will not satisfie as worthie <hi>D. Voetius</hi> judgeth <hi>de Pol. Eccl. p.</hi> 283.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Obj.</hi> This shienesse were good in case the oath as word<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed could bear such a sense as is supposed to be meaned by the tenderers. But it is not so here. <hi>Ans.</hi> It is certane the oath (as to the part controverted) is conceived in generall termes: It is certane that their sense who tender it, is not sound: &amp; it is certane that there is nothing in the oath contradicting their sense &amp; meaning: Yea it is certane that the very oath it self, as worded, will take in all their sense &amp; meaning; For it giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to him a supremacy of power both over Civill &amp; Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick persones &amp; causes, <hi>all persons,</hi> &amp; <hi>all causes</hi> will take in both, &amp; <hi>supreme Governour over all these persons, &amp; in all these causes,</hi> will take in a great power, &amp; a very large su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy: Yea the very grammaticall construction of the oath will bear this large sense fully enough. Any of understanding may easily see these three things here. 1. That the King is the same way supreme Governour over Church men, as he is over Civill men. 2. That he is made the same way Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in Church causes, as in Civill causes. And 3. That he is the same way Governour over Church men in their Church
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:65203:148"/>
capacity, or in their Church causes &amp; actions; as over Civil men in their civil capacities, &amp; in their Civill causes &amp; actions.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>Obj.</hi> The sense can be no other then this, That he is supreme Governour over all persons what ever action they be about, as if he were in a ship he should be supreme Governour over all the persons there, what ever their trade or occupation were, &amp; of the Governour of the ship among the rest; And yet it will not follow, that he is the supreme Governour of the action of guideing the ship, but only that the Governour of the ship, while he is guideing her, is a subject: And just so is it here, as to Churchmen. <hi>Ans.</hi> Even his supremacy over civill persons in civill causes is much to be questioned as hath been said; But to wave this here, their Acts &amp; deeds which are more authentick interpretations of the oath, then any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat conjectures, speak some other thing: were the oath worded thus, <hi>he is supreme Governour over all Persons,</hi> this objection would have some colour, but when it is said <hi>in all causes,</hi> yea <hi>&amp; in all causes,</hi> all is wrong. Next it is certane from what hath been said Sect. 10, &amp; 11. that they intend more as to the civill part, then that he is supreme Governour over civill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons &amp; that they remaine subjects while about civill Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; For he is made supreme Governour over civill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, &amp; in civill causes; And must it not be so likewise, as to the Church part, seing the oath puteth no difference lesse or more betwixt them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. One maine end of the oath was to shoulder out the Pope &amp; his power &amp; this was an immediat cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of Church affaires, &amp; a power not only over persons, but over causes; And what was taken from the <hi>Pope</hi> with the one hand, was devolved on the <hi>King</hi> with the other. 4. The <hi>simile</hi> is a plaine <hi>dissimile,</hi> as it is set down: but make the paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel run thus. There is a forraigner within the ship challenging power of making lawes to all persons within it &amp; particularly to the pilote, &amp; power of judging him in his actions as pilote, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt whom &amp; the Prince the debate cometh to that height, that he is ejected, &amp; to the end, he may never be re-admitted, the Prince imposeth an oath upon all within the Vess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="263" facs="tcp:65203:148"/>
him to be their only supreme Governour, &amp; in all their actions &amp; causes. And then any of ordinary capacity may discerne whether or not the pilot be not bound by his oath to acknowledge some thing more then that he is a civill subject while he is about his calling &amp; work. But all this is to no purpose now seing their Acts &amp; actings make the bussinesse clear enough as is shown above.</p>
               <p>7. <hi>Obj.</hi> Where a Civil Magist. is affirmed to be Govern. of his dominions, by common intendment this must be understood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of a civil government, &amp; may not be extended to that of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kinde. <hi>Ans.</hi> With all due respect to the reverend author of this reply, viz. Bishop <hi>Vsher</hi> in his speach concerning <hi>the oath of supremacy in the Starre Chamber</hi> in <hi>Irland.</hi> This doth not satisfie; because by the same reason, might one who were clear for the primacy of <hi>Scotland,</hi> lawfully swear, that the Archprelat of <hi>Saint Andrews</hi> were supreme Governour of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> over all persons &amp; in all causes; because, by parity of reason, when the governement of a Church officer is spoken of, by common intendment, this must be understood of an Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastick governement &amp; may not be extended to that of another kinde. And yet no doubt, this oath would be scrupled at, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding of that common intendment. But 2. Their acts &amp; deeds destroy that common intendment, &amp; respect must be had to their intendment, &amp; not to the common intendment. 3. Even as to this common intendment in respect of the civil part it hath been showne what just ground of scruple there was.</p>
               <p>8. <hi>Obj.</hi> No other thing can be understood, for he is capable of no more, &amp; the predicat can agree no further to the subject, then its capacity will permit. <hi>Ans.</hi> This is a shift for Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, but for none else: For. 1. Such subjects are seen to assume to themselves more, then they are truely, by any law of God, capable of. 2. By this meanes one might swear that the civil Magistrat were <hi>Head, husband, King &amp; saviour</hi> of the Church without all hazard of perjurie for these predicats can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to him no further then he is capable: As also one might law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully swear that the <hi>Pope</hi> were supreme civil judge of the King's Dominions, yea &amp; swear the greatest untruths imaginable; but such <hi>Salvo's</hi> will prove too narrow to cover perjury in the day
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:65203:149"/>
of accounts. 3. Oaths are the end of controversies, but this oath should then decide no controversie: For the King's pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er should be as uncertaine, as ever it was, for all this oath. 4. The question is not so much what power doth really ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine unto the civil Magistat, but another thing founded on this, viz. what power may one lawfully say &amp; swear doth indeed belong to him: And will any be so prophane &amp; grosse, as to say, It may be acknowledged by oath, that he hath more power then indeed he hath? Such like metaphisicall distinctions, will not defend from the wrath of God, in the day when he shall be a swift witnesse against all false swearers.</p>
               <p>9. <hi>Obj.</hi> Is it faife to contend with heigher powers about such things, &amp; bring on such sad sufferings? <hi>Ans.</hi> Christians should be most taken up with duty, &amp; should not value suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: They should buy the truth, &amp; by no means sell it, &amp; this matter under debate is no small bussinesse, whatever some may think. Not to mention here the sad consequences of this oath, as to the civil part thereof, if the Ecclesiastick part therof be only noticed it, will appear to be a matter of greater moment then every one will beleeve; as may appear from the reasons men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. <hi>Sect</hi> 12. Men who would be accounted loyal subjects unto a King of clay will think it their duty to stand &amp; contend for a small &amp; inconsiderable bit of a thing, going under the name of a privilege of the crown, to the hazard of life &amp; all; &amp; shall any Christian accounte such things, as are reall privileges of the crown of Christ, frivolous, And not worth the hazarding of any thing for? The asserting of <hi>Christ</hi> to be <hi>head</hi> &amp; <hi>King</hi> of his Kingdom, which is distinct from all other Kingdoms upon earth, &amp; that he alone hath power to rule this his Kingdom, with his own lawes, &amp; by his own officers; And that none may rob him of his crowne &amp; scepter, or of any part or pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicle thereof, seem to be no small matters. Who will condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne the generation of the righteous who like valiant souldiours, have stood for the defence of their master's prerogatives, &amp; would not give their consent, unto the spoiling of his crown, no not in the least, even when condemned to death therefore, &amp; banished out of the land of their nativity: The words of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous

That Christ is tho head of his Church. 2. That she is free in her governement from all other jurisdiction except Christ's are the speciall cause of our imprisonment being now convict as traitors, for maintaining thereof.

Howbeit the matter as set forth by you seem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable; yet as comprehended in the oath, it seemeth very inconsiderable: Were these things expresly affirmed, there were some colour of reason for refuseing to acknowledge the same; but seing they are only your inferences &amp; groundlesse feares there is lesse reason to refuse the oath. <hi>Ans.</hi> It is no new thing, for sufferers to be blamed as faulty: This is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, &amp; every one may see it, that the temptation is stronger for taking then for refuseing of the oath, there being much more outward &amp; worldly advantage to be had by taking then by refuseing of it; and therefore such should be Christianly sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathized with seing the matter they stand upon, is not t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="266" facs="tcp:65203:150"/>
standing upon their ground; &amp; to be willing for the interest of their Lord &amp; master to lose their liberties, yea &amp; their lives too But. 2. It is sufficiently manifested already that neither these inferences nor their feares, were groundlesse, so that it were superfluous to adde any more here for cleareing of the same.</p>

But the Parliament or Councell would give li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to persones to explaine themselves, &amp; to expresse what their meaning of the oath was, &amp; in what sense they would take it: Why was not this favour accepted? might they not have taken it in their owne sense, seing no doubt, that would have been a saife sense? <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Some indeed reporte that this favour &amp; courtesy was conferred on them in private, and therefore they had no scruple to take the oath: but all had not this in their offer. 2. Others as wise &amp; judicious, would have looked upon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> such an offer as no savour or courtesie at all, &amp; indeed it deserveth not the name of a favour, to give li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to any to mock God, others, &amp; themselves; Such a liberty could be nothing else but a snare to the conscience: For, by words, to put a glosse upon a written or printed oath, which in strick construction it will not bear, &amp; then sweare it &amp; subscribe to it, is to mock the most high who will not be mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. To subscribe an oath <hi>in terminis</hi> as it is offered, &amp; set down in write or print, after it is mentally or verbally glossed, is to stumble the truely godly, &amp; to harden the wicked in the age present; &amp; to mock posterity, who shall see the oath <hi>in termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi> subscribed, but neither see nor hear of the glosse, which as a <hi>salvo</hi> was cast in; yea &amp; it is to deceive themselves by intangle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves into the bonde of a sinfull oath, with faire speaches &amp; plausible apprehensions, or rather dreames. But. 3. Why would they not suffer such as they required to take the oath, to set down their sense in plaine tearmes before their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription? And why would they not rest satisfied with that which the Six or Seven forementioned ministers did? Sure, if it had been tendered upon any other account then as a snare to the conscience, this would have been granted; but it is true, the taking of the oath after that manner, would not have serv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their purpose so well as now it will, when subscribed as set

Because in the oath it self, truth is required; but a proposition having an indefinit and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous sense, before there be a distinction used for clearing, is no true proposition, yea it is not a proposition at all; for a proposition, (as children know by it's d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Because of him who ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth the oath, for the proper end of an oath, is that he in whose favours it is taken should have some certainty of that whereof he doubted before, but there can no certanty be had, out of words which have no certaine sense. 3. Because of him who sweareth who if he take such an oath on these termes, either stumbleth his neighbour or else spreadeth a net for his own feet; For to what else should such collusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on tend then either that by our example others (though against their conscience) may be induced to take it, &amp; this is to lay a stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling block before them; or that afterward by vertue of that oath some thing may be required of us which is either unlawful or hurtful &amp; this is to lay a snare for our selves.

Every sin even the least must be shuned upon any hazard; Yea all are commanded to abstean from every appearance of evill. It may be suffering for righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse sake, in the eyes of God, which men may account suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for needlesse serupulosity. If they had been of the same judgement with such divines (called so at least) who now a dayes publish to the World, their new found out principles, whereby all oathes may be loosed, or broken rather as rotten ropes; They might have taken &amp; digested a cartfull of oaths (to use the expression, which some who now have renunced that oath &amp; Covenant which once they swore, did utter, when minded of their former oaths) &amp; never once enquired whether lawfull or unlawfull (&amp; to say this on the bye it is no small matter of admiration to think what security, such can expect from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by oaths who themselves professe &amp; publish the Art of loos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the bondes of oaths; but it would appear that, this is not the thing designed, but rather this that seing they know such as they have to deal with are men of conscience, they would have them either ensnared, in the same guilt, &amp; drawn unto the same excesse of wickednesse &amp; Atheisme with themselves, or else exposed to their fury &amp; cruelty) but they love not such principles of prophanity &amp; Atheisme, but rather desire to feare an oath knowing that God is jealous, &amp; will not hold such guiltlesse as take his name in vaine. 2. If this be the oath of alleagiance, it is very farre changed from what it was, as was showne above Sect. 12. &amp; it is not faire to change it so as to make it worse. 3. In the matter of oaths, reason &amp; religion would require, that the meanest who are concerned in it, should be condescended unto: Rulers should follow the lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable example of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who did condescend unto his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant in the matter of an oath, which he was tendering unto <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

before they be imposed; Be examined againe &amp; againe, and so worded, as none, no not the meanest, who is endued with understanding in those matters, may have the least reall ground of scruple. And as to this oath, they are not a few conceity &amp; self willed persons, who scruple at it, but if Impartiall search be made, it will be found that the most und<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erstanding, faithfull conscientious &amp; Zealous in the land, both Ministers &amp; others, do stumble at it, &amp; that not upon imaginations &amp; feares, but upon reall &amp; evident grounds.

But. 4. If they would not alter or change the words of the oath, might they not have published such a sense of the oath as none might have scrupled at, there are seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall acts of Parliament explicatory of former acts, &amp; why might not this have been explained by a new act? 5. What these grounds of state policy are why they would neither helpe the oath &amp; worde it other wayes, nor yet give a sound glosse there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, &amp; make it as publick as the oath it self, is not very need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to enquire; yet there are some so obvious &amp; conspicuous that he who runneth may read them, viz.

               </argument>
               <p>WHen by these wayes forementioned a great number, even the third part of the Ministery of <hi>Scotland,</hi> was put from preaching the Gospell, &amp; banished from their own, parish Churches: There were a number of naughty base men who had denyed the faith which once they professed; &amp; renunced that covenant which they had sworne with hands lifted up to the most heigh God; Men for the most part of flagitious lives, corrupt both in their principles, &amp; in their conversation, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to have the privilege of Church members, in any well go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned Church, let be to be officers in the house of God: And men who will willingly comply with any course which Satan &amp; his instruments can set on foot, thrust in upon the people, sore against their wils, having presentations from patrons, &amp; collations from the prelats, &amp; no more, for a call. And there are others, alas too too many, who being in the Ministerie before, have basely betrayed their trust, &amp; complyed with those abjur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed prelats, &amp; gone contrary to that covenant which both them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves did sweare, with hands lifted up to the most high, &amp; which they caused all within their severall congregations to sweare, in a most solemne manner, as hath been showne above: And now did the tryall come near to the doors of the poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for there was an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament, I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And Every burges to lose the liberty of merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizeing, tradeing, and all other privileges within brugh—&amp; the fourth part of their moveables—and such other corporall punishments, as the Councell shall think sit.</hi> And yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of this act, faithfull &amp; honest Christians were constrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in conscience, to withdraw; &amp; could not yeeld obedience unto this act; but resolved rather to suffer affliction, what ever it might be, then countenance such as had intruded themselves without a call, &amp; had made such defection from the truth &amp; cause of God; &amp; for this cause many have suffered, &amp; many are put to suffer dayly, whom no tender hearted Christian will or can condemne, if these few particulars be considered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To yeeld obedience unto this act enjoyning them to hear such men alwayes &amp; to attend all the ordinary meetings for worship, &amp; so to countenance them as lawfull pastours, were to comply with the sinfull defection of the time, as appeareth from these two particulars. 1. It were a countenanceing of these men who have broken covenant, &amp; overturned the whole work of reformation, &amp; an approving of them in the same; for themselves look on all such as obey that act, as their friends, &amp; the act it self sayeth that <hi>a chearfull concurrence, countenance &amp; assistence given to such Ministers, &amp; attending all the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry meetings for divine worship, is an evidence of a due acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of, &amp; hearty complyance with, his Maj. Government ecclesiae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall &amp; civill, as now established by law within this Kingdom,</hi> for in order to this last, the act sayeth that this Maj. doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the former; And experience proveth much of this to be true, viz. that such as do countenance them after this manner do indeed approve of them, &amp; by the contrary they look on others, as disaffected persons, so that obedience to the Act is the very badge of complyance; And therefore upon that account cannot in conscience be yeelded; for in such a case many things which otherwise might be lawfull or indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent cannot be lawfully done, as being most inexpedient, &amp; what is not expedient, in so far as not expedient, is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, &amp; un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </hi> sayeth, 1 <hi>Cor. 10: v.</hi> 23. 2. It were some way also the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:65203:153"/>
of the power &amp; authority of Prelats: And so contrary to the league &amp; Covenant, &amp; the reason is, because, these men come forth, from the Prelat having no other call or warrant, but what the Prelat giveth: And so a receiving of them is a receiving of the Prelat, as a refus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ing to owne them, will be accounted a slighting of the Prelat &amp; his power. These things will be clearer, if two things be considered 1. That now there is no door opened for getting any wrongs redressed, &amp; cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions in the ministery, which creep in &amp; abound, remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; There is no accesse for grieved persons to presente their grievances; Corruption &amp; defection is carryed on with such a heigh hand, that there is no liberty once to speak or object against such &amp; such corruptious; Yea all these corruptions are approved: So that all possibility of getting any redresse made, is away: And in such a case as this, when privat per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons have not accesse to propound their objections, against such or such a man's exerceing the ministeriall function, or no hopes of getting a hearing; But by the contrary such persons as they would objecte against, would be the better liked; And these things, which they might objecte as hainous crimes, would be accounted vertues &amp; matter of greater commendation; what can they do else, but withdraw &amp; not countenance such vitious &amp; naughty persons, nor do any thing which may import, a consenting unto, or an approving of these grievous wrongs &amp; enormities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Especially considering. 2. How there is now no other way left for persons to exoner their consciences before God &amp; the world, &amp; to declare their Non-conformity unto this wicked &amp; corrupt course of defection: All other doors are barred by law, so that now they must either give testimonie against this course of defection this way by refuseing to give obedience unto this Act, &amp; to countenance these men (whose chief qualification is perjurie) as Ministers of the gospel; or else they must be accounted consenters: For how else shall their dissatisfaction be known. There is no patent door now, for any legall exoneration of their consciences by remonstranc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, &amp; protestations, the Parliament haveing declared such Actions to be treasonable: Yea there is not so much as liberty
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:65203:153"/>
granted for petitioning or supplicating against any such abuse: And of necessity, they must some way or other give publicke testimony against these courses (for they must not partake of other mens sinnes) as are carryed on, contrary to the word of God, to the Covenant, &amp; to their former resolutions: And there is no other way so harmlesse &amp; Innocent as this, though suffering should follow thereupon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By giving obedience unto this Act, they should be in hazard, not only of falling away unto a detestable neutrality &amp; indifferency in the matters of God; but ere long, they should be in hazard to fall away in heart &amp; affection, from the cause of Christ, &amp; from the work of reformation sworne unto, and owned so much; for there is no other way now apparent, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the difference shall be keeped up, betuixt such as honestly minde the covenanted work of reformation: &amp; the corrupt prelaticall, &amp; malignant party, but this of refuseing to give obedience unto this Act. So that, as it is already too too apparent that some who had no scruple to hear these men, and withall thought to abide constant to the cause of God, were ere long found to be deceived; for piece &amp; piece the edge of their Zeal was blunted, &amp; their affection to the work of God cooled, &amp; they at length were brought to condemne it: So dangerous a thing is it to suffer the standing difference to weare out of sight: So that let a Man once beginne to countenance those men, as lawfully called &amp; authorized Ministers, &amp; by this meanes, keep up no standing difference, he shall, ere he be aware, slide into their campe, &amp; side with them in all things: Therefore it is best to keep up this distance &amp; standing difference by with drawing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By giving obedience unto this Act, they should quite undoe &amp; betray their posterity: For though now the honest party be not in a capacity, to transmit the work of reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto their posterity, in such a manner as were to be wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it being now defaced &amp; overturned, by this course of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which is so violently carryed on; yet they may, &amp; should do something for keeping fresh the memory of the good old cause, that it be not bury<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>d quite in oblivion, &amp; this must
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:65203:154"/>
be, by keeping up some footsteps of a standing controversy, for <hi>Zions</hi> interest, &amp; the work of God against the common enemies thereof, the prelaticall &amp; malignant faction: But now take this weak &amp; inconsiderable appearing in the fields against these corruptions, away, what appearance of a standing controversie shall posterity see? Shall not they conclude that the day is lost, and the cause gone when they see that this generation hath fled the field or rath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er sold &amp; betrayed the cause, by owneing, countenancing &amp; complying with the enemy, &amp; that there is no standing testimony against corruptions, or nothing seen in the practices or carriage of their fathers, that may in the least signifie their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfaction with these courses. Where as if there were but this much of a standing difference, betwixt the people of God, &amp; the common enemies of <hi>Zion,</hi> to be seen, posterity would in some measure, be keeped from being deceived, &amp; would see the interest of <hi>Christ</hi> not killed, nor buried quicke; but living though in a bleeding condition: &amp; this would occasion their engadging for Christ &amp; interessing themselves in the quarrell: And it is far better to see the cause of <hi>Christ</hi> owned, though by suffering &amp; blood, then sold &amp; betrayed by base flenching &amp; complyin gwith persecuters.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is not a more ready way to harden &amp; encourage the enemie in their wicked &amp; malicious way of opposing the work of God, then thus to countenance them in obedience to this act. This is a way to strengthen their hands in their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed courses; for then, they encourage themselves in evill when they see how they are countenanced by all, &amp; that there is no disrespect put upon them, nor dissatisfaction evidenced against their courses, then they conclude that they are approved of all, &amp; this hardeneth them, so that they never once think of the evill of their wayes: Whereas were they disowned, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding of the act, it would cool their courage, &amp; possibly occasion some reflecting thoughts upon their courses, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time or other; And who knoweth what might follow? It is more then probable that the people of God, are not freed from seeking the conviction, repentance, &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>dfiication, even
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:65203:154"/>
of these their malicious enemies: And it is certane they may not encourage them in their evil wayes, nor do any thing which may really tend to harden them in their wicked courses. And therefore if obedience to this act will in all probability have this effect, it ought to be forborne.</p>
               <p n="5">5. By giving obedience unto this act, they should stumble the truely tender in conscience, by encourageing them to do contrary to their light &amp; conscience, after their example; when they are not clear to hear them, they are imboldened or stirred up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thereunto, when they see others doing so, &amp; thus they are ready to halt in the wayes of the <hi>Lord,</hi> &amp; this is a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous sin, to seek to destroy those for whom Christ died. But it will be objected. That hearing the word, is duty, &amp; so, if any stumble thereat, it will be but a scandall taken, &amp; not given. <hi>Ans.</hi> The question is not whether it be a duty to hear the word or not, but whether it be a duty to hear the word out of such mens mouths, &amp; that in obedience to the act; or so as the act doth enjoyne, &amp; if this be not a necessary duty, the objection falleth to the ground, for it is not at hearing of the word, that men do stumble, but at hearing of such men preach who are not lawfully called. This solution will be cleared by considering what is the Apostle's answere in matters of meat &amp; drinke, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14: &amp; 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8: &amp; 10. He would have them forbeareing such or such meat, at such or such a time, when there were hazard of stumbling thereat, &amp; for his part he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved never to eat flesh rather then by eating thereof he should stumble any weak Christian, &amp; yet it is an indispensable duty to eat meat, there is a command for it, &amp; the command doth alwayes oblige though not <hi>ad semper</hi> to all times. So then though it be a commanded &amp; necessary duty, to eat meat; yet it is no necessary &amp; indispensable duty, to eat such or such a sort of meat, as fish or flesh, nor is it necessary to eat alwayes at such or such a time, but both may be forborn for the scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall &amp; offeńce of the weak: So the parallel will run clearly, it is a duty to hear the Gospell preached; but it is not a necessary &amp; indispensable duty to hear such or such a man alwayes; &amp; so in this case, scandall may have place, as well as in the case of
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:65203:155"/>
meats; &amp; <hi>Paul's</hi> arguments are of force here. And therefore Christians should be tender of those for whom Christ died, &amp; be loath to occasion their stumbling, by doing that which is not a necessary &amp; indispensable duty, as it is circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated.</p>
               <p n="6">6. By yeelding obedience unto this act they should cast themselves into snares &amp; temptations, &amp; that because many of those intruders, if not all of them, do teach false doctrine, tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to seduce the hearers, crying up the lawfulnesse of prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, &amp; venting bitter invectives against presbyterian govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, inveighing against the covenant, &amp; so teaching &amp; incour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aging people to follow them, in open perjury, &amp; condemning the work of reformation, as being nothing else but treason &amp; sedition, which were blasphemy: Beside some poynts of <hi>Arminianisme</hi> &amp; <hi>Popery,</hi> which some of them are venting, now &amp; then. Seing then there is such false Doctrine held forth, &amp; taught with such boldnesse, &amp; impudencie, can it be lawfull for simple people to attend such, when their souls are in such ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard to be seduced thereby, &amp; when the Spirit of God sayeth <hi>cease to hear the instruction that causeth to erre from the words of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge? Prov. 19: 27. Beware of false Prophets)</hi> is a command that is of force now, as well as of old, <hi>Iohn</hi> in his second Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle v. 10: 11. sayeth <hi>that if there come any unto you &amp; bring not this Doctrine, receive him not unto your house neither bid him God speed, for he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> it is sure then <hi>Iohn</hi> would never advise people to goe constantly or ordinarily to hear such deceivers who bring not with them the Doctrine of <hi>Christ.</hi> He who would not have the lesse done would never consent unto the more. <hi>Paul</hi> writting to the <hi>Romans Chap. 16: v,</hi> 17, 18. sayeth. <hi>Now I beseach you bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren Marke them which cause divisions &amp; offences contrary to the Doctrine which yee have learned &amp; avoid them, for they that are such serve not our Lord Iesus Christ, but their own belly &amp; by good words &amp; faire speaches deceive the hearts of the simple.</hi> Here is a clear warrand for avoiding (&amp; that will at least include a refuseing obedience to this Act) such as teach things contrary to the Doctrine which hath been already received, &amp; Learned out of
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:65203:155"/>
the word, &amp; do thereby cause divisions &amp; offences &amp; have nothing before their eyes but their own belly, &amp; not the glory of Christ. And how well this agreeth unto those men now spok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en of, any who know them may judge. And therefore se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is their designe &amp; intended work to deceive the hearts of the simple, by their bold &amp; consident assertions, &amp; to cause them beleeve things contrary to the Doctrine which they have already learned &amp; received, it must be a necessary duty for poor simple people to avoid such. So the Apostle writting to <hi>Titus cap.</hi> 1: 14. forbiddeth <hi>to give head to jewish fables &amp; comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of men that turne from the truth,</hi> &amp; who are these who teach such things? See v. 10, 11. <hi>unruly, vaine talkers, &amp; deceivers, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucres sake.</hi> It cannot then be lawfull to obey this act. So writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Philippians cha.</hi> 3: 2. He sayeth <hi>beware of dogs, beware of evil workers beware of the concision</hi> by whom the false teachers of these times are to be understood. Now he commandeth to <hi>beware</hi> of those, that is, shun them, forbear to hear them, follow them not: And againe v. 17: 18, 19. he sayeth <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren be followers together of me, &amp; Marke them which walk so as ye have us for ensample, for many walk of whom I have told you oftin, &amp; now tell you even weeping, that they are enemies to the crosse of Christ, whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, who minde earthly things.</hi> So he would have them following such as taught as he did, &amp; walked as he walked, &amp; not such as were enemies to the crosse of <hi>Christ:</hi> And certanely when <hi>Paul</hi> would have the <hi>Ephesians cap. 4: 14. No more carryed about with every winde of Doctrine, by slight of men &amp; cunning craftinesse, whereby they lie in waite to deceive</hi> he would not have them following or attending the Ministerie of such, concerning whom the question is. So when he willeth the <hi>collossians cap. 2, v. 8. to beware least any man spoile them through Philosophy, and vaine deceit, after the tradition of men after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ,</hi> he would not have people give obedience unto this Act, &amp; to attend the Ministery of such who teach false Doctrine, By slight &amp; cunning craftinese, whereby they lie in waite to deceive &amp; seek to spoile people of the truth
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:65203:156"/>
by their Philosophie (such as it is) &amp; vaine deceit after the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of men &amp; not after Christ &amp; seek to beguile with enticeing words. So in his first Epistle to <hi>Timothie cap. 4. v.</hi> 1, 2. He sayeth <hi>that in the later times some shall depaire from the faith, giving head to seduceing spirits, speaking lies in Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie having their consciences feared with a hote yron.</hi> It must then be hazardous &amp; most dangerous to give head to such se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceing spirits, as speak lies, &amp; have their consciences seared with an hote yron, as being the cause of departing stom the faith; so that such as will guaird against departing from the faith would take heed whom they heare. So in his <hi>second Epistle</hi> to <hi>Timothie cap. 3, v.</hi> 5. he speaketh of some whom he would have all honest people turne away from, &amp; these he describeth first from their corrupt conversation, <hi>v.</hi> 2: 3, 4, 5. thus <hi>men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous boasters, proud, blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, disobedient to parents, unthankfull, unholy, without naturall affection, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of these that are good, treatours, heigh minded, heady, lovers of pleasures more then lovers of God</hi> much time needs not be spent in shewing how fitly all these agree unto the persons now spoken of, such as know them can best judge. But then secondly he describeth them from their Doctrine, <hi>v, 6, 8, 13. They creep into hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and lead captive silly women; us Ia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p n="7">7. If it were lawfull to hear these in obedience to this Act, it would be also lawfull, upon an Act, to attend the Ministerie of <hi>Anabaptists, Antinomians, Socinians, Arminians,</hi> or <hi>Iesuits:</hi> And if it would not be lawfull to do this, no more can it be lawfull to attend the Ministerie of these in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, who seek to pervert the right wayes of the Lord, &amp; la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to subvert the simple people, &amp; to turne them away from the truth.</p>

8. Such as their Doctrine is such are the prayers, not only stuffed with errour, but larded with blasphemy, as might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silie be shown, were it fit here to mention what their expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are: As their Doctrine tendeth to reproach the work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation &amp; the power of godlinesse, so do their publick prayers, as such as hear them can showe, They pray for a blessing on the prelats, under the name of <hi>Reverend,</hi> &amp; <hi>right Reverend fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> &amp; on their wayes &amp; courses (which God will curse &amp; blaste) not to mention their unsound &amp; parasitick expressions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King's supremacy calling him <hi>head of the Church</hi> &amp;c. Now seing tender consciences can not joyn with them in those prayers, how can they attend their Ministerie? Are not all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent bound to joyn in prayer with them who should be the mouth of all the congregation unto God &amp; pray with them? &amp; when out of the corruption of their heart they ordinarily utter expressions savouring of blasphemy &amp; errour; can godly tender consciences goe alongs with them,? And seing they cannot, how can they be bound to attend their Ministerie? There are snares in <hi>Prayer</hi> no lesse then in <hi>preaching.</hi> Yea particular persons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre more with the minister in prayer then in preaching; &amp; there fore they may more saiflie hear errour preached then joyne in an erroneous prayer, for in the one they are purely passive, But in the other they are some way active: &amp; therefore unquestionably there is sin in constant attending the Ministerie of such, with whom if they concurre in prayer, they must sinne.</p>

an accepting of them as Ministers lawfully called notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they want the election of the people, &amp; have nothing for their warrand, but a presentation from the patron: And so this would be nothing else upon the matter but a consenting unto this incroachment; And a joyning with such as wronge &amp; spoile the Church: To say that people in that case should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test against these incroachments, &amp; so exonere themselves, were to put them, to run their heads against a wall: &amp; next their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuseing thus to obey the act, is, upon the matter a protestation, &amp; if after their protestation they were bound to hear them &amp; att<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end their Ministerie, they should undoe their own protestation, by their after carriage; for by their protestation they declare, that they cannot look upon them as Ministers having a lawfull call, according to the lawes of Christ, &amp; by their after carriage, in constant attending of their Ministerie, they should declare to all, that they owne them as lawfully called Ministers; And thus their practice should belie their protestation. Nor will it be of any force to say that their fore-fathers did submit unto the Ministerie of such as had no other call but the patron's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation: For there is a vaste difference to be put butwixt a time wherein the Church is advanceing in a course of reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; &amp; a time wherein she is declineing &amp; slideing back from that degree of reformation unto which she had already attained: In a time wherein the Church is but coming out of darknesse, &amp; the day is but begining to break up, many things may then be comported with &amp; tolerated, which may not be submitted unto, after the Church hath gotten all these abuses reformed. Every beleever, &amp; every Church is bound to stand fast in that which they have attained unto, &amp; not to cede in a hoof: So that Christians living in a time wherein the Church is but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining to wrestle up, from under the heap of errour &amp; cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, may be allowed to do many things, which must not be done, when the noontide of the day is come. In the time of the reformation begun by <hi>Luther</hi> &amp; others, many things might have been comported with in the Church, (refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation being a graduall motion that hath but small be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginings &amp; riseings) which now since the reformation
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:65203:157"/>
hath been carryed on, through the blessing of God, to that degree it was advanced to, cannot be allowed: When God hath wonderfully by his mighty power &amp; out-streached arme, brought a Church to a great length in reformation, it will be the duty of that Church &amp; of the members thereof to adhere to that degree unto which they have attained, with all perseverence. It will be lawfull for the Church which is but coming up the hill to stand at such a step untill they gaine another; when yet it will not be lawfull for the same Church, to goe backward after they have advanced. The truth once bought should never be sold: so then the consequence is null, Their fore-fathers stumbled not, nor did scruple, at the doing of such or such things. therefore these in this generation, who have advanced, through the blessing of God, unto a further degree of reformation, should not scruple either: It is a poor consequence to say, The posterity may return backward, because their fore sath. Is could not advance further: Much more may be seen when the sun is up then in the twilight. Therefore the scrupleing of honest people now, doth no way condemne their fore-fathers: But on the contrary, the stedfastnesse of their fore-fathers, in stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the degree, to which they had reached, &amp; their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to advance, will condemne this generation for back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sliding. In their dayes those abuses &amp; corruptions were not remedied, the Church was not then freed of that yoke of oppression. And furder their after consent unto such Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters made up this defect; But those in this generation are not at liberty to give or grant their after consent, because they are engadged to stand to the work of reformation, &amp; to owne it in all its parts, whereof this is one, vis. the putting away of the usurpation of patrons, &amp; the putting the Church in possession of her own privileges, &amp; this they must owne upon any haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, if they would not betray their trust. The right way of Election was not setled by law in their fore-fathers dayes, &amp; so they were groaning under that oppression, &amp; constrained to make the best of that ill bargan they could: But it were utterly intolerable for those in this generation to consent unto the wreething of that yoke, which hath been once loosed
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:65203:158"/>
from their Lawes, about their necks againe. Nor will it be of any force to say, within few ages, yea or yeers, such a thing as this will never be scrupled at: for if defection be carried on, with as great vehemency, as it hath been these few yeers by past, it is like, grosse popery shall not be scrupl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at ere long, except by such as now do scruple to countenance these intruders. And what ever the following posterity may be allowed to do, to prevent worse, it will plead nothing for these in his generation; because it is their part to stand in the gap &amp; leave their dead bodyes there, rather then give way un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any degree of defection, which may cause posterity to curse them. More is expected of a standing army, then of stragling souldeours; these may make some shift after the army is broken, to get as good quarters, as they may, when it were basenesse &amp; utterly unlawfull for any to do so; while the army is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broken. Small things should be stood at, in the time of the begining of an apostasie: when the watters of corruption are begining to break in, the least hole should be stopped, &amp; watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over.</p>

By giving obedience unto this act, they should, upon the matter, iustifie &amp; approve of, &amp; consent unto the violent &amp; cruell thrusting out of these whom God had setled in those places, &amp; whose labours he had blessed, &amp; thus they should consent unto this terrible act for persecution of the godly &amp; faithfull Ministers of the Lord: And therefore they could not do it in conscience. The antecedent is cleared thus. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause to imbrace &amp; encourage such, were to approve of the ground, upon which they enter, &amp; that is, their comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the sinfull defection, &amp; their submission &amp; obedience unto the sinfull injunctions of the time: And what were that else, but a condemning of the honest Ministers who could not in conscience so comply, nor submit, &amp; an approving of the sad sentence gone out against them. He who willingly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth unto an usurper, &amp; accepteth of him as a lawfull su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour, by yeelding all active obedience, doth thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that the right of the usurper, is good, &amp; better then his

It may be questioned, as to some of them, whether they be Ministers at all or not; for as they have not the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications required by the Apostle, neither as to life, nor abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, being scandalous in their life &amp; conversation, to the view of all onlookers; &amp; as to doctrine, being either cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, or utterly insufficient, having none of the qualifications requisite: So nor have they any thing like a solemne ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or setting apart for that office, having no imposition of hands of the Presbytery, with fasting &amp; prayer, according to the order of the Gospell; but the sole warrand &amp; mission of the prelat: &amp; therefore it cannot be lawfull to countenance such, &amp; to look upon them as lawfull Ministers. It is true, privat Christians may not set themselves up into the chaire, &amp; judge of the enduements &amp; qualifications of Ministers &amp; what nulleth their office &amp; what not; yet every private Christian, hath the use of the judgment of discretion, and that way may judge whether such an one, appear qualified according to the rule of the word, or not. It is certaine there may be times wherin such men may be set up into that office as have few or none of all those qualifications required in the word: Such corruption may overgrow the Church, (as by past experience hath abundantly evinced in the times of popery) as that the most unfit men imaginable shall be installed in the office of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery: Yea &amp; now likewise some such might be instanced, if it were fit.

It is likewise certane that privat Christians

It would be considered, for furder confirmation of
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:65203:162"/>
the last particular. That the maine thing which <hi>Christ</hi> is pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing upon his hearers here, is that they would beware to follow the practices of these <hi>pharisees,</hi> for all that heigh place which they took upon themselvs in the Church, &amp; on the by, as it were, he speaketh anent their receiveing of their true doctrine, by way of concession, or of their doing &amp; observing, whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they delivered as sitting in <hi>Moses's</hi> seat, whereof they were presently in possession, by their usurpation, &amp; while there were no other ordinarily occupying that seat at that time. So that these things being considered it will appear, that this place mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no way for the attending the Ministery of such men, there being no command here, to heare the <hi>Pharisees</hi> at all, let be to heare them alwayes &amp; constantly, only a command there is, to do &amp; observe what they, from <hi>Moses</hi> law, bad do &amp; observe, which may import a hearing of them expounding the law of <hi>Moses</hi> while there were no other ordinary teachers of the law: But if this place prove not (which it will never do) that the Ministery of these scribes was to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly attended, it will speak nothing against these who could not obey that act.</p>
               <p>It will be objected in the next place. That refuseing to give obedience to this act, will be separation from the Church &amp; ordinances, which are not, nor yet can be corrupted by the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of administrators. <hi>Ans.</hi> For clearing of this, let these things be considered. 1. Corruptions in administrators are of two sorts: some personall, &amp; these alone, it is true, cannot defile the ordinances in their hands, &amp; make them no ordinanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es: others are, to speak so, Ministeriall, or such as affect the office. And these againe are either of smaller moment &amp; lesse dangerous, or else such as cut the very throat of the office &amp; make one no officer: &amp; without all question those corruptions that destroy the office, in it's essentials, &amp; make the man no Minister, do corrupt the ordinances in his hands: he who is no minister cannot baptize, nor administrat the sacrament of the Lord's supper, nor preach with authority, as a Minister, &amp; he can do no Ministeriall act: &amp; it is past questioning, that such may be shunned without all hazard of separation, &amp; of
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:65203:162" rendition="simple:additions"/>
this sort it may be, some of those now spoken of, are. 2. When personall faults are very grosse, &amp; palpable, open, &amp; avowed such may be shunned without any hazard of separation, because that man's being an officer, <hi>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ram deo,</hi> is much to be question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed &amp; there is great probability that <hi>ipso sac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>o,</hi> in the court of God, he hath forsaulted the same, though such should be the corruption in a Church, that notwithstand of all this, he may be maintained. But. 3. <hi>separation</hi> is one thing &amp; not-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such or such a man is a far other thing; there may be many just grounds of exception against such or such a particular person why he should not be countenanced as a Minister, or why people may refuse to countenance him, without any hazard of separation or joyneing with separatists in their principles. Every not-hearing is not separation: a man may many a time, be absent from hearing, &amp; yet cannot be justly charged with separation: Yea separation is one thing, &amp; refuseing to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Ministerie of such or such a man, is another thing. A man may never hear such or such a man preach; &amp; yet be no separatist from the Church, wherein he liveth; for he may joyne with the ordinances in another congregation; &amp; so testifie that he hath no prejudice against the Ministerie, not against the ordinances of <hi>Christ,</hi> nor against the Church; but only a prejudice against such or such a man in particular. 4. So then, so long as the refusers to obey that Act do not cast at the ordinances but are willing to run many miles to enjoy them though they should be inhumanely used, by the way, by soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, led forth of purpose For that end; Nor cast at the Church as no Church (though they sadly feare that God shall be provoked by this dreadfull defection, which is carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on by these men &amp; their favourers, to give her a bill of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce) Nor at the ministerie, for they love these who stand by their principles, dearly; &amp; are most willing to hear them ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in publick or in privat, what ever inconvenience or suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering may follow thereupon. 5. It is granted by all such as write against separatists, that separation from a Church is lawfull, when the case so falleth out that union cannot be keeped up with her, with out sin, much more will a forbearing to hant

Where he is laying down some considerations, about the degrees of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, sheweth us, That there is <hi>a separation negative,</hi> or <hi>a non union,</hi> as That in <hi>Augustin's</hi> time, when the faithfull did separate from the <hi>Dona<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>sts,</hi> which is lawfull, &amp; landable: now if there be a separation here, it can only be a negative separation, &amp; not a positive separation. He sheweth us againe <hi>ibid.</hi> That there is a separation from the Church in the most &amp; worst part, &amp; a separation from the least &amp; best part, &amp; that these who separate from the worst &amp; greatest part, do notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing remaine a part of, &amp; a part in the visible Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they do not separate from the Church according to the least &amp; best part thereof; as the godly in <hi>England</hi> who refused the <hi>popish cerem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Moreover he sayeth <hi>Pag.</hi> 254: 255. That there may be causes of <hi>non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union</hi> with a Church, which are not sufficient causes of a separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as, before the jewes came to blaspheme openly, (as they did <hi>Act 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>: 44, 45, 46, &amp;</hi> 18. 16.) there was no just cause why any should have joyned to the Church of the jewes, seing there was a cleaner Church to which converts might joyne themselves Act 2: 40, 41, 42. And whether or not the reasons

formerly laid down, will be a just cause of <hi>non union</hi> (which is all we plead for) let the reader judge. Lastly, he tels us <hi>ibid Pag. 255.

Hence it is aboundantly clear, that such as refused to obey this Act cannot be accused as guilty of sinfull separation.</p>
               <p>It will be <hi>objected thirdly.</hi> That by refuseing to obey that Act they declare they look not on these men as Ministers, &amp; if they account them no Ministers, they must say that their bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizeing is no baptizeing: &amp; also that the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> now is no organicall Church.

Though it were affirmed positively (as it is not) that all of these men were no Ministers; Yet it would not follow that the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> were no organicall Church; because all these ministers, who are now violently restrained from exerceing their Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall function, are Ministers &amp; officers of the Church of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> though bound up from exerceing their office: for as no deed of a Magistrat can loose a Minister's relation, (so long as his life is in him) unto the Church universall; so no deed of the Magistrats can loose a Ministers relation to the nationall Church whereof he is a member, so long as he remaineth <hi>

Whatever may be thought ofsome of these men, (whose being reall officers in the Church of God (as was said) may much be questioned) &amp; what sad consequences may follow upon the nulling of their office, let these see to it who either send such forth, or imploy them. Yet as to all of them, this forbearing to yeeld obedience unto this Act, will not ground the consequence alledged: For there is a difference betuixtthe not owneing &amp; dis-countenanceing of a man as no Minister at all, or no Minister of the Church universall: And dis-owneing, or dis-countenanceing him as not being their minister in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, or as pastor of such a particular flock.

It is certane, a man's relation unto such or such a particular flock may be Changed by transportation, when his relation unto the Church univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall abideth: And so it is certane that a denying of one to be a Minister of such or such a particular flock will not, by any good consequence be a denying of him to be a Minister at all; Many things may lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Or be it so, that they were most vitious &amp; outwardly loose &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, Yea &amp; persecutets, there is nothing here warranding a constant or ordinary hearing of them, or an owneing of them as lawfull Ministers of Christ: all that is here, is a rejoyce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the gospell was spreading, though Sathan &amp; Sathan's instruments were imployed therein far against their intentions. There is nothing which can import <hi>Paul's</hi> approveing of such, as lawfull Ministers; for as judicious <hi>Calvin</hi> sayeth on the place <hi>Though he did rejoyce at the gospels advanceing: Yet if it had been in his power, he would never have ordained such to be Ministers of the Gospell.</hi> So, though the godly now would rejoyce if they saw the Kingdome of Christ prospering, by the mighty power of God, carrying on the same, far contrary to the intentions &amp; designes of such as now call themselves ministers of the Gospell (which, as it doth not sensibly appeare unto them so it altereth the case far) yet it will not follow that therefore they are bound to owne such, as lawfull Ministers of the Gospell, for as <hi>Calvin</hi> sayeth on the place <hi>we must rejoyce when God bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth any good to passe, by wicked instruments, &amp; yet therefore such are not to be put into the Ministerie, nor to be accounted law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

Ministers of Christ:</hi> So that this place can prove nothing, but that Christians should rejoyce when they see the gospell pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveing in the hands of wicked instruments coutrary to their intention &amp; purpose, through the mighty power of God out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shooting the devil (as we say) in his bow: And not that they should owne such as lawfull Ministers of the gospell, &amp; constantly attend their ministerie when they may profite more another way, &amp; when their countenanceing these men so, shall harden their hearts in their evill wayes, shall stumble the truely godly, shall wrong their own souls, &amp; dishonour God. Rejoyceing at the gospel's prospering is one thing: And countenanceing, encourageing, receiveing &amp; approving of every one who giveth out himself for a Minister thereof, be he otherwise never so vitious &amp; insufficient, is a far other thing; And the one will no way inferre the other; as any, with half an eye, may see: Therefore whatever these preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were, whether such as sought praise of men, preaching out of envy that <hi>Paul</hi> might not get all the glory, and with all indirectly accuseing <hi>Paul</hi> for rashnesse &amp; imprudence, &amp; as justly suffering upon that account, to the reproach of the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell &amp; scandall of the weak, as <hi>Aretius</hi> on the place thinketh: or such as desired to procure his death, That <hi>Nero,</hi> through their preaching, hearing of the generall disperseing of the doctrine taught by him, might be thereby enraged to take away his life whom he had now in bonds; as the <hi>English</hi> annotators think: Or both: there is nothing here that can with any shew of probability plead for hearing of, &amp; owneing as Ministers lawfully called, such as are spoken of in this debate.</p>

                  <p>It is lawfull for such Ministers as are banished from their flocks to preach, wherever they be, either in publick, or private.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>WHen thus the honest Ministers, whose labours God had singularly blessed among the people, are thrust from them by force, &amp; insufficient scandalous &amp; naughty men, are thrust in upon them, sore against their will, their trouble &amp; tryall, is made to grow dayly, for now their meeting in any quiet place to hear any honest man, preach the gospell of Christ, is called a conventicle &amp; diligent search is made after such, to the end, that both they &amp; the Minister whom they heare, may be apprehended &amp; punished, according to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of these persecuters: And thus the honest &amp; Zealous ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Christ, are either put from making mention of the name of the Lord at all, whether in publick or in private: Or brought into great trouble &amp; hazard thereby. Is it not a very sad &amp; astonishing thing, that when whole countrey sides, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most laid waste, people wandering from place to place seeking the word of the Lord, &amp; Thousands are perishing for want of knowledge, &amp; multitudes deluded with false teachers; such Ministers as were driven from their own flockes might not lay out themselves for the good of perishing souls &amp; do what they could for instructing, strengthening, &amp; comforting of the poor afflicted &amp; persecuted people of God? May not this be matter of admiration, that any upon this account should be put to suffer? And certanely none with any shew of reason, will condemne those Ministers if they take notice of these few particulars following.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Though they were banished by the sentence of a civill judge, Yet they remained still Ministers; no such sentence of a civil Magistrat can depose a Minister from his office: The spirit of the prophets, as to this, is subject to the Prophets only.
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:65203:166"/>
It is true, it followed upon their banishment as a necessary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, that they could not exerce the Ministeriall function in that place out of which they were banished: But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of any Act of banishment they remained Ministers; for there is no such connexion betuixt their being Ministers, &amp; their being in such a place. And all the sentence of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strat reached only to their being, or not being, in such a place. All this will be beyond disput with such as are not grosse <hi>Erasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> for no reformed divine will acknowledge that the civill Magistrat can immediatly depose a Minister; far lesse can he do it by the sole Act of banishment. So then this is clear, that those Ministers who were banished from their owne parishes, remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed still Ministers of the gospell, yea &amp;, as hath been said in the fore-going section, Ministers of the Church of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It is no lesse clear unto all such as have not drunken in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent principles. That all such as are Ministers, have a relation unto the Church universall, and unto the natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Church wherein they are, and so may, wherever they are, discharge the duty of Ministers, in preaching &amp; admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strating the Sacraments.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Not only may they do so, but there is a necessity laid upon them to preach the gospel, &amp; woe is due unto them, if they do it not, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9: 16. If once they have given up themselves unto <hi>Christ,</hi> as serva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

They have a divine command <hi>to preach in season, and out of season,</hi> &amp; to lay out themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves, to the yondmost for <hi>Christ,</hi> and his interest. This will also be undenyable: especially considering in the next place.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That there was never greater necessity, for their bestirr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of themselves as faithfull Ministers of the gospel, then now, when there are so many thousands left destitute: &amp; so many led away with false guides, who make it their work to deceive people, &amp; to pervert the right wayes of the Lord: &amp; so many ready to faint under persecution &amp; sore affliction. Is

Are there not many honest followers of <hi>Christ</hi> lying under sore oppression &amp; bondage their spirits being griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, &amp; their souls wasted with hearing &amp; seeing what they do hear &amp; see? And have not these need to be comforted &amp; cheered up under the crosse? Doth not God allow consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to such? &amp; is he not calling on his servants to speak com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably to such? Are there not many almost fainting by reason of their weaknesse, &amp; the continuance of the tryall &amp; should not Ministers minde that command, 1 <hi>Thes. 5: 14.

Great then is the necessity that poor people are into, &amp; double must the woe be, that abideth such Ministers, as are silent, at such a time, when all things call upon them to lift up their voice like a trumpet; &amp; to shew people their transgressions, &amp; their hazard, &amp; to be burning &amp; shineing lights, that such as walke in darknesse may see their way &amp; be comforted.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Such a practice is aboundantly warranted by the <hi>Apost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi> &amp; other Church officers, in the primitive times: For they went to severall places &amp; preached the Gospell; When they were persecuted in one city, they went unto another, &amp; still preached the gospell where ever they came: The history of the acts of the Apostles, aboundeth with instances of this kinde, so that it is needlesse to cite any. If it be said that these were
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:65203:167"/>
extraordinary officers <hi>Apostles, prop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ets,</hi> &amp; <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> who were not fixed to any one place, as the ordinary officers were. It is answered. That preaching of the Gospell was not the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctersticke of unfixed officers, but common to them with fixed pastors &amp; doctors: &amp; preaching unfixedly was not alwayes their note &amp; essentiall mark, because in times of persecution, pastors &amp; doctors might have preached, wherever they came, as the officers of the Church of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> did, who, being scattered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad upon the persecution of <hi>Stephen</hi> act. 8. 1. <hi>Did goe every where preaching the word, v.</hi> 4. Those who were scattered behoved to be the fixed officers of the Church of <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> for it is not probable, that the Apostles would have left that Church of <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> so long without <hi>preaching officers</hi> fixed for preaching &amp; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrating the sacraments, seing they had instituted <hi>Deacons</hi> who were lesse necessarie, <hi>Act</hi> 6: 1, 2, 3, 4. &amp; seing themselves were not fixed there, but were to goe thorow the world, according to <hi>Christ's</hi> appoyntment, &amp; the direction &amp; guideing of the Spirit.</p>
               <p n="6">6. So is it warranted by the practice of the faithfull &amp; honest servants of <hi>Christ</hi> in all ages, who through persecution being thrust from one place, went &amp; preached the gospell in another: both in the time of the first ten persecutions, through occasion of which, the Gospell was spread far thorow the world, &amp; at severall times since. The honest servants of <hi>Christ</hi> in Queen <hi>Mary</hi> her dayes went abroad preaching the Gospell: So did the zealous servants of <hi>Christ</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> when banished, or compelled to flee preach in <hi>England, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>rance</hi> &amp; <hi>Holland,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any new ordination, or any thing like it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. There is some necessitie lying upon them to preach, as occasion offereth that they may not stumble the poor ignorent people, who upon their silence are ready to think that the civil Magistrat hath power to depose Ministers formally: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if there were no more but this it were enough to provoke them to preach, that the world might see, that they put a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt the power of the Magistrat, &amp; the power of the Church; And that when they submit unto the Magistrat, keeping within the compasse of his calling, &amp; exerciseing that power which formally agreeth to him, though he should mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:65203:168"/>
as to the application: They will not submit any further, to the wronging of the privileges of the Church: And so will let the world see that they are still Ministers of the Gospell, though banished from their particular flocks.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Their silence in such a case would be stumbling unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who look upon it as an evidence of fainting, &amp; fear in them, who dar not open their mouth, nor appear for Christ &amp; speak to the edification &amp; encouragement of sufferers, least it offend the Magistrat: And when such are so faint-hearted how doth it discourage others, &amp; strongly prevaile with some to goe over the belly of their own light &amp; conscience, yea moreover it hardeneth the wicked in their evil courses, &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courageth them to persecute more &amp; more, when they see such fainting &amp; discouragment among the followers of Christ.</p>
               <p>So then when these particulars, are considered, It will be found that such Ministers do but their duty, &amp; that they would come short in their duty, if they did not so preach the Gospell.</p>
               <p>If it be <hi>Objected</hi> here. That to preach in such a disorderly way would be a breaking of the established order of the Church viz. a preaching within such a Bishops dioecy without his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense, &amp; so it would be a course not approved by the God of ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. It is. <hi>Answered.</hi> 1. That ceremonies or matters of mere order must be passed by in times of necessitie, such as this is. 2. Such an established order as tendeth to the ruine of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, is but iniquity established by law, for that is not an order of God's appoyntment which is destructive to the maine bussi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, viz. the edification of souls, &amp; therefore such an ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which is to destruction &amp; not to edification, is not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gairded, 3. Where is there any warrand for such an order or appoyntment in all the Gospell? Did the <hi>Apostles</hi> ever aske li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty from the corrupt <hi>Clergy</hi> among the <hi>Iewes,</hi> to preach <hi>Christ,</hi> in such or such a place? Where is there any warrant for such as are Ministers called of God &amp; orda<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ned, to suspend the exercise of that function till they have the license &amp; good will of a prelate? This is that popish leaven which the former <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:65203:168"/>
Prelats</hi> had from <hi>Rome:</hi> preaching the Gospell is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly commanded to all who are Ministers, &amp; there is not the least syllabe, for their going to a Bishop, who is nothing else but a creature of man, to seek license: And certanely none can think that these Ministers might have gone to the prelat, to obtaine liberty; seing that would have been a cleare acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging of them &amp; their power, contrare to their vow &amp; cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. So then it was better to take the way of the Apostles, &amp;c to obey God rather then men; &amp; to preach at God's command, when man forbiddeth, as well as to preach truth when man commandeth the contrary, seing he hath no power from God for that effect more in the one case then in the other.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It may be possibly further <hi>objected.</hi> That how ever they remaine Ministers &amp; so may preach as they have a call; yet to seek corners &amp; hideing places to preach in, to separated congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions cannot be allowed in a constitute Church: <hi>Ans.</hi> If they be Ministers of the gospell, they may lawfully preach the gospell, where God in his providence giveth them a call to preach. 2. Since they cannot have liberty to preach the gospel in publick, they may &amp; must do it in private, when the necessity of the people calleth for it. <hi>Christ</hi> &amp; <hi>his Apostles</hi> did not alwayes get the publick places to preach in, but were content of privat roomes: Many a time did <hi>Christ</hi> preach by the sides of mountaines, by the sea side, &amp; in such by-wayes; And so did the Apostles: <hi>Paul</hi> could get no better at <hi>Ephesus</hi> then the school of <hi>Tyrannus:</hi> and two full yeers he preached in his own hired house at <hi>Rome Act.</hi> 28: 30, 31. &amp; therefore this practice of theirs cannot be condemned; for. 3. As the Church was then <hi>in fieri,</hi> so is it now in a decaying condition, &amp; therefore though it were granted (which is not yet clearly proved) that in a Church rightly constituted, such private preachings, were not lawfull; yet when a Church is fallen from her right constitution, &amp; is upon the decaying hand (at without all doubt, the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> is this day) many things may be allowed, as they are, in a time when the Church is but <hi>in fieri:</hi> &amp; as to this particular in question, a time of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution (as this is) is alwayes excepted; so that it is lawfull
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:65203:169"/>
enough now, so long as this persecution lasteth, to preach the gospell in private when no liberty can be had to do it openly. 4. These Ministers are gathering no separated congregations, but only preaching to all who will come &amp; hear the word of truth, in such quiet &amp; retired places, where they may get it done most saifly &amp; may be most free from distraction &amp; trouble of their enemies, who are waiting to finde them out, that they may haile them to prisons. Who then can condemne their cariage in this.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If any should further <hi>object</hi> &amp; say. That this would be an open contempt of the Magistrat's lawfull authority, &amp; disobedience to his lawfull commands; For though it be true, that he cannot take away the office of a Minister or the power of order, &amp; so degrade him; yet he may take away the exercise of his Ministeriall function, at least, he may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the exercise of the same, within any part of his Kingdome or dominions <hi>Ans.</hi> Whether there be such an expresse prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or not is not certanely known, nor whether or not the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection doth suppone, that the Magistrat's Act of banishing of them out of their own parishes, or out of the bounds of their respective presbyteries, doth include a discharge of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>erceing the Ministeriall function, any more, within the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. If the objection goe upon this supposition it is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently answered above. But next, suppone there were such a command expresly prohibiting them, they were not bound to give obedience. Because to inhibite &amp; discharge the Actuall exercise of the function of the ministry is a spirituall censure, it is reall suspension, which is a sentence that can lawfully be passed only by a Church judicature: &amp; the civill Magistrat can no more suspende from the exercise, then he can depose from the office; for the one is a degree unto the other: See <hi>Apoll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de jure Maj. circa sacra: pars 1, pag.</hi> 334, 335, 336. And <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therfurd's due right of presbyteries, pag.</hi> 430: 431. And therefore though the civill Magistrat should passe such a sentence, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious Ministers ought not to obey; because, the civill Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrat, in passing such a sentence, is not keeping within his sphaere but transgressing the limites of his calling, &amp; when the civill Magistrat is usurping the power that doth not belong
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:65203:169"/>
unto him, obedience is not to be yeelded, neither is he to be countenanced or encouraged in that. Therefore though there were no more, this is sufficient to call all Ministers to give testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony against such an usurpation, by refuseing to obey any such Act, or by preaching, when God giveth a call, in his providence, in any place they come<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>e, of another case: And it is concerning such as either are, or shall be suspended, or deposed by the prelats or their Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods: And it may be; some may think, that though they be not bound to be silent upon the sentence of banishment passed against them, by the civil Magistrat: Yet being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally silenced or deposed by the Bishop, or his Synod, they cannot lawfully contraveen that Act &amp; sentence, it being the act &amp; sentence of a Church judicature, or of such as have formally Church power &amp; authority. But the serious pondering of these six things, will cleare that notwithstanding thereof they are bound to look upon themselves as Ministers, &amp; so not only may but ought to exerce their Ministery as God shall put opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in their hands.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Submission unto such a sentence would be an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging of the <hi>prelate</hi> &amp; of his power, &amp; this is contrary to
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:65203:170"/>
their oath &amp; covenant: Such officers as prelats, were cast out of that Church, &amp; abjured, &amp; now submission unto their sentence, would be an expresse owneing of them, &amp; acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging them to be really cloathed with Church power, &amp; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly with power over <hi>preaching presbyters;</hi> &amp; so they should acknowledge another officer in the Church, then Christ hath instituted, which no true Christian ought to do. If the <hi>

                  </hi> should take upon him to depose or suspend any Gospell Minister, would not that Minister acknowledge the power of the <hi>Pope,</hi> if upon the receiving of such a sentence he should leave off the exercise of his Ministery? And when the civil Magistrat taketh upon him to depose a Minister immediatly, if that Minister should upon such a sentence, be silent &amp; sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, would he not thereby acknowledge that the Magistrat had power to depose Ministers formally? Sure none could doubt of this: So then it is beyond all question that to submit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to such a sentence, would be a clear acknowledging of their power, &amp; this is diametrically opposite unto an endeavour to extirpat them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If it were lawfull to submit unto their sentence, it were undoubtedly lawfull to compeer before their court <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> before a lawfull court, &amp; answere unto any accusation given in against them, for if one may acknowledge the lawfulnesse of the sentence of such a court, they may also ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it lawfull to answere before them, &amp; so lawfull to owne them as a lawfull court. Now seing conscientious Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters could not have clearnesse to compeer before the <hi>prelat</hi> or his <hi>Synod,</hi> when summoned; can it be expected that they should counter-act their own testimony &amp; condemne themselves, by submitting unto their sentence?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Such a submission would prove very stumbling unto the godly for. 1. It would encourage them to owne the prelats as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Church officers, to compeer before them, to obey their acts, &amp; so to owne &amp; acknowledge them as lawfully impowered; for if they be owned &amp; acknowledged in one particular, why not in all? 2. it would wronge the peace of the godly, who have hither<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="307" facs="tcp:65203:170"/>
ing, when they should see ministers submitting to their sentence, as to the sentence of any uncontroverted lawfull Church judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Who ever condemne this non-submission, sure such, as of late, thought they could not in conscience submit (&amp; also all such as did approve them in that particular) unto the sentence of deposition or suspension, passed against them by a controvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>assembly,</hi> because they looked upon it as no lawfull <hi>Generall assembly,</hi> being not lawfully constituted; cannot condemne this; but according to their principles, must preach; for no doubt the power of <hi>prelats</hi> is much more to be questioned; then the power of such <hi>assemblies,</hi> &amp; even many who will stand to the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying of that <hi>assembly</hi> will never justifie the power of <hi>prelats,</hi> &amp; therefore it cannot but be expected that such as thoughte the sentence of that controverted assembly null, should now look on the sentence of a prelat, as null and of no effect and therefore as little, if not lesse, to be regairded &amp; submitted unto.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Beyond all question, it is a sentence proceeding from such as have no power, &amp; therefore ought not in conscience to be submitted unto. A minister who is called of God must not lay aside his office or the exercise of his office &amp; power, upon every man's desire: But if he be exauctorated at all, it must be by such, as have lawfull authoritie for that effect, unto whom he is bound in conscience, to subjecte himself; And so he shall have peace though the sentence be passed <hi>clave errante, unjustly.</hi> There will no man quite any of his goods upon a sentence come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from an incompetent judge; And shall a Minister quite with his Ministerie, which should be dearer unto him then any thing else, upon a sentence proceeding from an incompe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent judge, ora privat person? this in reason cannot be expected.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If so be they should submit unto this sentence &amp; account themselves no Ministers, It would follow that though the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats</hi> were all away, they might not preach nor exerce any ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall Act, untill a Church judicature would take off the sentence againe, &amp; then not only they, but the Church judicature also, in so doing, should acknowledge the validity of the sentence
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:65203:171"/>
and consequently the lawfulnesse of the power from which it did slow.</p>
               <p>But it will be <hi>objected.</hi> 1. That that sentence cometh not from the <hi>Bishop</hi> alone, but from a <hi>Synod</hi> whereof he is only the moderator. <hi>Ans.</hi> Though the sentence be given out at the meeting of such as are underlings to, &amp; complyers with him; Yet the sentence is only his sentence, &amp; this he is pleased to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie unto all, at their meeting, left they should forget it, &amp; so mistake him &amp; themselves both; And he indeed maketh a fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of asking their votes, to the end they may be partakers of the guilt, &amp; of the <hi>odium</hi> with himself; But he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth them to have no power, unlesse it be to give their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell &amp; advice. But. 2. It hath been showne above that such meetings are no lawfull Church judicatures, no presbyterian meetings, but prelaticall conventions &amp; conventicles, set up of purpose, for his ends &amp; for the carrying on of his designes. And their not compeering before these meetings sayeth they did not acknowledge them to be lawfull meetings, &amp; therefore they cannot now acknowledge their sentence.</p>
               <p>It will be <hi>objected.</hi> 2. That though they ought not to be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto as <hi>prelats</hi> or <hi>co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And thus It is still clear that this sentence should not be submitted unto, if it were no
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:65203:171"/>
more but for this one cause, because it should be an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeing of the Magistrat's power in the matter of Church censures, which is an assertion unto which no sound reformed divine will assent.</p>

That seing it is certane such shall be put from their Ministerie ere long however, for if they sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit not unto the sentence, the civil Magistrat will either ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish or imprisone, or some other way put them from it, whether they will or not, were it not faifer then to prevent further suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to themselves &amp; theirs, by submitting in time? <hi>Ans.</hi> It is true, that in all probability the civill powers will not suffer such to preach long, after such a sentence is dissobeyed; But yet it is the duty of all, so to carry themselves, when suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is at hand, as that they may have most peace of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, &amp; quietnesse under the crosse: And it is certane they shall have far more peace, who continue preaching as oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity offereth, notwithstanding of any such sentence, untill some phisicall restraint or what is equivalent, be laid upon them; Then such as shall willingly submit unto an unlawfull sentence, proceeding from an unlawfull judicature, deriveing power from an empty fountaine, &amp; thereby give offence &amp; great scandall both to good &amp; bad.</p>
               <p>It will be <hi>Objected.</hi> 4. That submission to judicaturies established by law, is necessarie; Either obedience active or passive is necessary, otherwise there shall be no order. <hi>Ans.</hi> Whatever may be said anent <hi>submission,</hi> or <hi>non-submission</hi> unto the unjust sentences of lawfull judicatures; Yet it will be clear, that no submission should be yeelded unto the unjust sentences, of unlawfull judicatures.

This much, saying <hi>we plead not for submission to officers, &amp; judicatories, not of Christ's own institution, such as, not only, popes, but prelates,—&amp; were no lawfull Church officers so that here their arguments conclude not, taken from the practice of Ministers, not submitting to the sentences of prelats in the Church.</hi> So that then all the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as to this particular, it seemeth, was of one judgment and
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:65203:172"/>
thought that Ministers should not submit unto prelats passing a sentence of suspension or deposition against them, these prelats being no lawfull Church officers: &amp; so it is clear that this <hi>non-submission</hi> in this case, is no new thing in that Church, but was the practice of severall worthy &amp; precious men before, as the book before mentioned sheweth, which instances are worth the noticeing now.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>It is lawfull for the people, to hear those suffering Ministers, &amp; to meet for prayer &amp; other Christian exercises, in private.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>WHen the poor people cannot in conscience attend the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry of such as are thrust in upon them against their will; for the reasons already given; their temptation groweth double upon them; &amp; their trouble increaseth; for now when they goe to hear such Ministers, as they may lawfully hear, either in publict or in private, it is a cause sufficient for perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution: yea or if they meet two or three together, in any privat place, for prayer, conference, or any other Christian exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise, they are in hazard to be hailed to prison &amp;, punished as keepers of conventicles.</p>
               <p>Doubtlesse, it cannot be very necessary, to speak much, for the justification &amp; defence of those, who either have suffered, or may hereafter suffer upon that account; seing few who owne Christianity, or know the sweet of Christian exercises, and of Christian fellowshipe, will condemne such as value the good &amp; advantage of their souls beyond their bodies; yet lest some should be moved to think that at such a time, such wayes should be forborn, a little must be spoken to justify both those courses.</p>
               <p>And <hi>first</hi> for their going to heare, either in publick or privat
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:65203:172"/>
such Ministers, as are still lawfull Ministers, what ever sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence hath passed against them; &amp; have given a faithfull testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony unto the truth, by adhereing to their principles, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding of all the sufferings they do, or can meet with, much needeth not be said, seing,</p>
               <p n="1">1. They are so expresly &amp; often commanded to heare the word of truth, to heare what is the minde of the Lord; for by the Ministery of his servants doth God manifest his minde unto his people. <hi>The priests lips should preserve knowledge and the people should seek the law at their mouth, who are the messingers of the Lord of hosts:</hi> It is their duty to waite at the posts of wisdomes doors, this will be undenyable.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is an innate desire in the saints, after the word of truth, <hi>as new born babes they desire the sincere milk of the word that they may grow thereby, 1 Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> 212. So that, any who are offended with them, for this, must be offended with them for being Christians, &amp; must be offended with new born babes for desireing the breast; &amp; is it not cruelty to smite &amp; punish poor young babes for seeking the breast? What cruelty must this be then, to punish such for this, to which their nature as Christians, leadeth them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They have oftentimes, through the breathing of the spirit of God upon such exercises, found a rich in-come: as they gote life &amp; quickening grace that way, at the first, so have they oft found their souls revived, &amp; their hearts enlairged, their eyes inlightened, their drouping spirits encouraged, their feeble knees lifted up, their doubts answered, &amp; cleared, and their souls lifted up in the wayes of the Lord, &amp; strengthened to turne the battell to the gate, &amp; to stand against cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, &amp;c. And can any blame them for seeking after those watters that they have been so often refreshed by, formerly?</p>
               <p n="4">4. There was never greater necessity; for upon the one hand temptations abound, darknesse, fainting, discouragment grow: And upon the other hand, they have no other to goe to, unlesse they would resolve to drink of fouled watters, which their soul abhore: let none say that they thereby drive at sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:65203:173"/>
for they desire not to separat from the Church, not from the publick ordinances, whereever they can have them without sin; they love the ordinances, only they can not owne such men as their Ministers, who have so palpably betrayed their trust, nor can they attend the ordinances<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> here they cannot enjoy them to edification, &amp; the sheep must be a lowed to choose wholsome food, &amp; not to take poison.</p>
               <p>But is it not a strange thing that they will not suffer Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to meet together for prayer? It would seem they look on that <hi>God</hi> to whom the saints do pray, as their enemie, &amp; that they are afrayed of prayer: And indeed the time hath been when the prayers &amp; fasting of the saints of God have been terrible to the great enemies of God in that land, yea more terrible then Ten thousand men, as themselves have professed. But what is this else then to banish Christianity, to professe enmity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Christian exercises? And sure no Christian will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne Christians for flocking together, as birds of one feather do, for prayer &amp; other exercises in this evil time: seing,</p>

               <p n="4">4.

                  <p>The unlawfulnesse of compeering before the high Commission Court, demonstrated.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>TO the end that the forementioned persecution of the saints &amp; servants of God might be the better carryed on, There is a <hi>high commission</hi> court erected consisting of the two arch prelats, &amp; some other prelats, &amp; of some noble men, some Magistrats of brughs, &amp; some souldiers &amp; others: And this number or any five of them, a prelate being alwayes one of the five, have power granted to them from the King who appoynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them by vertue of his prerogative royall &amp; supremacy over all persons in all causes ecclesiastiek, as was shown above <hi>Sect. 12. To suspend deprive &amp; excommunicate, as also to punish by fineing, consineing, committing &amp; incarcerating all keepers of conventicles, all Ministers who contrare to the lawes &amp; acts of Parliament &amp; councell, remaine, or introduce themselves upon the exercise of the function of the Ministery, in those parishes &amp; bounds inhibited by those acts; all preachers who come from</hi> England &amp; Irland <hi>without sufficient testimonialls, or leave of the Bishops of their dioceses, all such persons who keep meetings &amp; fasts at the administration of the sacrament of the Lord's supper which are not approven by authority: All who speak, preach, write or printe to the scandall, reproach, &amp; detriment of the Estate, or government of the Church &amp; Kingdom, as it is now establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: All who contemne molest, &amp; injure ministers who are orderly setled: All who do not ordinarily attend divine worship, administration of the word &amp; sacraments, performed in their respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive parishes by ministers legally authorized, for taking the cure of these parishes: All such who without any lawfull calling as bussy bodies, goe about houses, &amp; places for corrupting, &amp; dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affecting people from their alleagiance, respect &amp; obedience to the lawes: And generally, without any prejudice to the particulars specified, all who expresse their dissa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

by contraveening the acts of Parliament &amp; Councell in relation to Church affaires, etc.</hi> This court appeareth terrible unto the godly, for the persecution of whom, &amp; of none else, no not the most flagitious &amp; prophane, it is erected; &amp; seemeth to be as a new court of inquisition. But that which is more lamentable is this: That there lyeth hid here a dreadfull snare for tender consciences; For it is such a court, as tender hearted Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians cannot but scruple to acknowledge, or compeer before, without a declinature, the giving in of which, would be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted <hi>laese Majesty,</hi> &amp; therefore in such a case, such as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to keep a good conscience, in this day of tryall &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, saw a necessity of withdrawing, &amp; of not compeering at their summonds, even though they might have pleaded them selves innocent of any crime laid to their charge.</p>
               <p>Now if any would desire to know the reasons why such a court cannot in conscience be owned, acknowledged or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto, as a lawfull judicature, let him consider these particulars, &amp; lay them together, &amp; he shall see clear reason for either declineing or withdrawing.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This is a judicature meddling with censures purely eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastick, such as <hi>suspension,</hi> &amp; <hi>deposition of Ministers,</hi> &amp; <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication</hi> both of Ministers &amp; people, &amp; therefore must be acknowledged to be a Church judicature. Now there is no warrand for any such Church judicature, in all the new te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament; nor is there any precedent of the like, to be found in the Gospell: &amp; Christians must acknowledge no Church judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature but what hath a speciall warrand from Christ's law &amp; te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This is a Church judicature having its rise, power &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission only from the King, &amp; the King granteth this power to this <hi>Commission</hi> &amp; authorizeth this court, by vertue of his <hi>royall prerogative over all persons, and in all causes, as well ecclesiasticke as civil.</hi> So that none can acknowledge this court but withall they must acknowledge the Kings prerogative roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, &amp; supremacy in all causes, &amp; over all persons; &amp; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly they must acknowledge that pure &amp; proper church pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, doth properly reside in the person of the supreme Magistrat,

&amp; that he hath proper power to <hi>suspend</hi> &amp; <hi>depose ministers</hi> &amp; also to <hi>excommunicate,</hi> &amp; so hath power to Commi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p n="4">4. In this judicature, ecclesiasticke persons have power of civill matters &amp; civill punishments, for the court hath power to <hi>fine, co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But that Church officers should me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with civill matters, is diametrically opposite unto Christ's word, <hi>Mat. 20: 25. Luk.</hi> 22: 25. where he forbiddeth all the exercise of any such power as was exercised by Kings and civill powers on earth, saying <hi>the princes of the gentiles exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise dominion, and they that are great exercise authority, but it shall not be so among you</hi> so that the very exercise of the power is prohibited, &amp; if any should think that he meaneth only the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Luk</hi> doth sufficiently take away this objection when he useth the simple words <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="319" facs="tcp:65203:176"/>
concerning primacy &amp; power, and not concerning the abuse of the power. So then whoever do acknowledge this court do approve in so far of this contradiction to Christ's command.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The acknowging of this court, would be upon the matter a justifying of all the Acts of persecution exercised against the worthles of old, for avouching the Kingly office &amp; power of Christ, &amp; declineing the civill courts, in Church matters; &amp; so a condemning of the Zeal of those worthies, who hazarded life &amp; all which was dear to them, in giving testimony, against the incroachments made upon the crown and privileges of Christ as King: But certanely a Christian tender of the glory of God, &amp; of his cause, which hath been, &amp; is hated &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted by his enemies; would scarre at this.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Particularly the acknowleding of this court, would be a condemning of worthy &amp; precious <hi>Mr Rutherfoord,</hi> &amp; <hi>Mr Dickson</hi> who declined the <hi>High commission,</hi> and refused to passe from their declinature on any termes, wherein they were singularly &amp; eminently owned of God, &amp; approved by his testimony to their spirits: And what tender Christian could do this?</p>
               <p n="7">7. The acknowledging of this court, is a clear breach of the first article of the league &amp; covenant, in severall particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars as. 1. the acknowledging of this court, is an overturning of all the principles of Presbyt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>rian Government, &amp; so contrary to that oath whereby every one is <hi>sincerely, really, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly, through the grace of God, to endeavoure the preservation of the reformed religion of the Church of</hi> Scotland <hi>in doctrine wors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hipe, discipline and government:</hi> And that because. 1. It is contrary to the principles of presbyterian Government to have Church power derived in whole or in part from any prince or potent at upon earth, but only from <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> the sole King &amp; head of his Church. 2. It is contrary to the principles of pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian government to have Church censures dispensed by any except Church officers. 3. It is contrary to the principles of presbyterian government to have Church officers medling with civill affairs. 4. It it contrary to the principles of presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:65203:177"/>
government to have any other Church judicatories, then such as are allowed by the Gospell. 5. It is contrary to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of presbyterian government to have Church power &amp; civill power confounded, &amp; in-distinct. 2. The acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging of this judicature, would be a condemning of the work of reformation in part; for this is one piece of the doctrine of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> &amp; one piece of the reformation viz. That Church officers should not meddle with civill power or places, &amp; this was much looked to, at the begining of the late work of reformation, &amp; condemned both by Church and state, <hi>Anno</hi> 1638, 1639, &amp; 1640. And therefore tender Christians could not do this, &amp; sinne against God.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The acknowledging of this judicature is a breach of the second article of the same league &amp; Covenant. Upon this account that it is an acknowledging of the power of prelats in the highest degree of that power which ever they had in <hi>Scotland.</hi> And next upon this account that it is an approving of that which is contrary to sound doctrine, &amp; the power of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, &amp; so a partaking of other mens sinnes, &amp; a runing the hazard of receiving of their plagues; expresly contrary to that article.</p>
               <p n="9">9. As to the civill part of this court (for it is a monster of judicatories, viz. two distinct bodies under one head) The ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging of it, would be a crossing of the third article of the league &amp; Covenant upon a two fold account. 1. In that it is a wronging of the rights &amp; privileges of Parliaments, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>o owne a judicature not approved &amp; established by any Act of Parliament old or late. 2. In that it is a wronging of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the Kingdome, to consent unto an arbitrary power, assumed by the prince over them, contrary to the fundamentall lawes of the land, in setting up what judicatories he pleaseth without consent of Parliament, without whose speciall warrant &amp; authority the meanest fixed court cannot be erected.</p>

                  </gap> &amp; therefore they being essentiall members of the court, it is impossible to compear, &amp; protest that in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing you do not acknowledge their civil power, without a self contradiction; for in your protestation you have them vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually laid by, as no constituent members, &amp; if they be no constituent members there is no court, yet your compearance sayeth that they are a court; &amp; so it would be a palpable contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to protest against these as no constituent members &amp; yet stand before them &amp; answere, as before a court: But as to the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> the case is far different, for when the prelats are there laid aside there is a full compleet court remaineing, before which, you may stand &amp; answere for your selfe: the <hi>Parliament</hi> hath been, &amp; may be, a full &amp; compleat <hi>Parliament</hi> without prelats but the <hi>high commission</hi> never was a court without prelats, &amp; may be a court with full power &amp; authority, when there are no other constituent members beside prelats.</p>
               <p>Some may <hi>object.</hi> in the third place, &amp; say This <hi>High com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission court</hi> doth not meddle with Church censures, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be looked on as a Church judicature, meddleing with Church causes &amp; Church censures; but is only a civil court med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leing with civil causes, viz. the putting of the Acts of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to execution. <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Though this were granted; Yet there is ground enough of scrupleing at the owneing of the same, as may be seen in the 4, 7, 9, 10, &amp; 11. reasons formerly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. But. 2. It is not very materiall to consider either how little or how much of their power they do put unto execution; but the maine thing is to see what power they may exerce: Now the best way to finde out this, is to look to their commission, which will abundantly cleare us in this: Their commission sheweth how far their power doth reach, or what actions or causes fall within the compasse of their power; And by this we
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:65203:179"/>
can best take up the nature of the judicature: So that if their commission give them power to suspende, depose &amp; excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, every one must look upon them as a judicature hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that power, whether they should alwayes, or never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erce it: And that their commission granteth to them this power, will not be denyed by any who hath ever seen the same; And that part of it which was cited, doth cleare it suffeciently: And therefore it is a mixed judicature, being as well Ecclesiastick as civil.</p>
               <p>If it be replyed. That properly they have no power of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spending deposeing &amp; excommunicating immediatly: But the meaneing is, they are to cause the respective Church ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatures to suspende, depose, &amp; excommunicate; for the Act or commission containeing their power, sayeth they have <hi>power to appoynt ministers to be censured by suspension, or dep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ion</hi> It is. <hi>Answered</hi> 1. They have power to appoynt Ministers to be censured by suspension or deposition, the same way that they have power to appoynt them &amp; others to be punished by fineing, confineing, committing &amp; incarcerating: but this power they execute not by putting other civil judicatures to do it, but they themselves immediatly do it; &amp; therefore so have they power granted to them to do the other immediatly, the ground of the answere is clear from the very words of the commission, which putteth no difference betuixt the way of their appoynting Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters to be suspended or deposed &amp; the way of their appoynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others to be fined &amp; confined or incarcerated, &amp; we must not distinguish where we have no ground: And therefore it is said more clearly in the former part of the commission, that they have power for the causes specified to <hi>suspend deprive</hi> &amp; <hi>excem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate</hi> &amp; these words make the matter as clear as can be, 2. This co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>t is raised of purpose to put the Acts of Parliament in execution, immediatly; for so sayeth the commission it self That <hi>they are to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> put in vigour and in impartiall execution</hi> Now as for this end they immediatly execute the lawes for fineing, confineing, &amp;c. So have they power also immediatly to execute these lawes that are
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:65203:179"/>
for suspending &amp; deposeing of Ministers. 3. The end why this court was erected sheweth further that it is in part a Church judicature; For it was erected to keep the peace &amp; order of the Church &amp; the governement thereof by Archbishops &amp; Bishops: &amp; to punish such as presume to violat, contemne, &amp; disobey the Ecclesiastick authority. 4. That which doth put the matter yet more out of doubt, is the <hi>Basis</hi> or ground on which this <hi>High commission</hi> is reared up, viz. <hi>his Maj. prerogative roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; in all causes, and over all persones as well Ecclesiastick as civil:</hi> Now if they looked upon this court, only as a civil court, haveing power to meddle only with civil punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, his prerogative royall in causes civil had been a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Basis</hi> for this. Therefore the expresse mentioning of his prerogative royall in <hi>causes Ecclesiastick</hi> putteth it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all debate, that they have proper Church power granted unto them, &amp; so may immediatly depose &amp; sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In the last place, Some may <hi>object</hi> against the arguments brought from the unlawfulnesse of Church men their taking upon them civil places; And say That though they will prove it unlawfull now for Ministers to take upon them such plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; Yet they will not prove it unlawfull for any to compea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> before them when instaled in those places; More then it can be unlawfull to come before a judge who possiblie hath come'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> to the place, by unlawfull &amp; indirect meanes: that is his fault, &amp; others are not concerned therein: so here it is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates their fault to take upon them these places, &amp; private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sones are not so much concerned therein. <hi>Ans.</hi> There is a vaste difference, betwixt the prelates in this court, &amp; other judges in other courts, though comeing to these places by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct meanes; For. 1. These other courts &amp; places of judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature are unquestionably lawfull; But the <hi>High commission</hi> is not a court so unquestionably lawfull. 2. Other courts are not affected, in the poynt of lawfulnesse or unlawfulnesse by the quality of the persones: But it is otherwise here in the <hi>High commission,</hi> the very lawfulnesse of the court is questioned upon the account of the prelats being members thereof <hi>sine qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

non.</hi> 3. These vices or indirect meanes, used by others for attaineing of such or such a place in a judicature, are for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>he most partsecrete &amp; not clear &amp; undeyable or obvious unto all. But that which is objected against the prelats is notour to all who read the gospell, where they are expresly discharged by, Christ to meddle in such a manner with any civil place or power. &amp; so. 4. That which is objected against the prelates is such a thing as affecteth the very person &amp; incapacitateth him for the place, but in the other cases instanced, these vices affect only the manner of entry, but do not incapacitate the person, a man may be one fit enough for such or such a place in a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature as to be a judge or a justice of peace or thelike, though he use indirect meanes to come by the place; but the prelats as prelats (if so be they will be accounted Church offic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers) &amp; because they are Church men, are uncapable of such a place, &amp; therefore though it will not be unlawfull to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a judicature unquestionablie lawfull, notwithstanding of some secret corruption in the entry ofhim who is in possession ofthe place: Yet it will be unlawfull to acknowledge a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature in it selfquestionable (at best) whether lawfull or not, when such persones are made constituent members thereof, yea &amp; members <hi>sine quibus non,</hi> that by the expresse law of Christ are uncapable ofsuch a place: and the acknowledging of this judicature cannot but be an approveing of that corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Because the very acknowledging of the judicature say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the persons who are constituent members thereof, are really &amp; legally capable of the place: as the compearing before &amp; acknowledging of a court made up of mere civil persons hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power to <hi>try, ordaine, rebuke, depose</hi> or <hi>excommunicate</hi> Ministers; should be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> acknowledgeing of civil persons, their having Church power, contrare to the lawes of the gospell. Therefore the arguments brought from the unlawfulnesse of Church men taking upon them civil places, are still in force.</p>
               <p>By those particulars, It is abundantly clear that that <hi>high commission</hi> court, is a most sinfull court, even as to it's constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; how dangerous it is to compear before it, upon any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count

Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is clear for peoples standing to their oaths which they have sworn in the Lord. They are to swear <hi>in truth, in judgment and righteousnesse, Ier.</hi> 4: 2. They must <hi>not take the name of the Lord in vaine,</hi> Which if done at all, is done by fore swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or swearing falsly. It is the qualification of one who is to inherite heaven <hi>Psal.</hi> 15. That <hi>though he swear to his own hurt he will not change.</hi> Such false sweareing is expresly against the minde of <hi>God</hi> as these scriptures do cleare, <hi>Levit.</hi> 6: 3. &amp; 19: <hi>v. 12. Numb. 30: 2. Ier.</hi> 5: 2. &amp; 7: 9. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16: 59. &amp; 17: 16, 17, 18. <hi>Hos. 10: 14. Zech.</hi> 5: 3, 4. &amp; 8: 17. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3: 5. Many precedents in scripture cleare it to be duty to stand to oaths: As these <hi>Gen,</hi> 21: 31. &amp; 24: 9. &amp; 25, 33. &amp; 26, 31. &amp; 31, 53. &amp; 47, 31. compared with <hi>Cap.</hi> 50, 5.

So <hi>Ios. 9: 15, 20. 1 Sam. 24: 21, 22. 2 Sam.</hi> 19: 23. compared with, 1 <hi>King. 2: 8. 1 Sam.</hi> 20: 17. compared with, 2 <hi>Sam. 21: 7. 1 Sam. 30: 15. 1 King. 1: 13, 30. Neh.</hi> 5: 12. Now shall Christians make no more of all these, them <hi>Sampson</hi> did of the new ropes? Shall neither law of nature, law of nations, nor yet the law of God be of any binding force? If so, they declare themselves not only to be no Christians, But to be no men. Sure then it must be a hainous iniquity for any who are engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this Covenant, to cast it behinde their heels, &amp; contradict what they have there sworne. It is a great sin to break a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, but it is a greater sin to break an oath; because an oath is a greater ground of security, &amp; in an oath the dreadfull name
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:65203:186"/>
of <hi>God</hi> is invocated to attest the sincerity of the promises &amp; pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses of the promisers &amp; this maketh the obligation stronger, &amp; so the breach of this bond must be the sader.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is in this, a clear breach of a vow, for in these covenants there is a promise made unto God, &amp; that is a vow. Now the obligation of a vow, is no lesse then the obligation of an oath; For in every vow there is an implicit calling of God to witnesse, &amp; a vow is of the like nature with a promissory oath, &amp; so should be performed with the like faithfulnesse (say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the confession of faith, at <hi>Westminster cap. 22. Sect.</hi> 5.) That lawfull vowes ought to be observed with all carefulnesse, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny both precepts &amp; precedents in scripture do cleare as <hi>Num. 30: v. 2, 4, 8. 1 Sam. 1: 21, Deut.</hi> 12: 11. &amp; 23: 21, 23. <hi>Ps. 76: v. 11. Eccles. 5: 4, 5. Gen. 28: 20. Numb.</hi> 6: 21. &amp; 21: 2. <hi>Iudg.</hi> 11: 30. compared with, <hi>Levit.</hi> 27: 28, 29, Ps. 132: 2. &amp; 22: 25. &amp; 56: 12. &amp; 16: 5. <hi>Prov. 20: 25. Isa. 19: 11. Iona.</hi> 1: 16. &amp; 2: 9. <hi>Nah.</hi> 1: 15. So then the sin of violating these oaths or covenants, being likewise the violation of a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne vow, made unto the Lord, after which it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full so much as to make inquirie, must be great.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is in this, a clear breach of a Covenant made with man, for in the <hi>league and covenant,</hi> The <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Parl.</hi> &amp; the <hi>people</hi> of the three Kingdomes, do mutually covenante each with other, for the performance of those things which do concerne them in their severall stations, either as to the work of reformation, or as to the preservation of each others mutuall rights &amp; privileges. <hi>King and Parliament</hi> do Covenante to preserve the <hi>peoples liberties: King</hi> and <hi>people</hi> Covenante to preserve the privileges <hi>of Parliament: Parliament,</hi> &amp; <hi>people</hi> Covenante to preserve his Maj. <hi>person honour</hi> &amp; <hi>authority.</hi> And all the people stipulat &amp; engadge each to other; so that here with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all doubt, there must be a clear breach of a Covenant, and this must be a grievous sin; for very heathens looked upon the breach of a Covenant as a hainous &amp; uncouth thing, &amp; did ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominat the same. Hence <hi>Collicrates</hi> did disswade the <hi>Ach<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="339" facs="tcp:65203:186"/>
Because it would be a breach of the Covenant which they had made with the <hi>Romans:</hi> see <hi>Liv. lib.</hi> 41. To break Covenant is a sin against the law &amp; light of nature, &amp; so condemned amongst very heathens <hi>Rom.</hi> 1: 30. &amp; for which the Lord gave them up to a reprobat minde, v. 28. The obligation of a Covenant is the highest assurance, &amp; greatest ground of security that natures light could finde out, betwixt nation &amp; nation, or betwixt man &amp; man, in matters of greatest concernment: And this ground of assurance is generally rested on, by all, unlesse they have to do with a <hi>Hannibal,</hi> or with the <hi>Samnites,</hi> whom no Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant could binde. Hence is that saying <hi>sides supremum rerum humanarum vinculum est] faith is the highest assurance in humane matters.</hi> It is spoken to the dishonour of <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don] that none could call him a good King, because that usually he despised oaths, and broke his promise upon any light occasion, so that no mans promise was lesse esteemed of]</hi> &amp; of <hi>Hannibal [that in warring against</hi> Rome <hi>he did wadge warre more against his owne faith and promise; and rejoyceing in lyes and deceit, as so many excellent arts, he resolved to leave behinde him a notable memory, of himself, but so as it should be uncertane, whether as of a good man, or of an evil man.]</hi> The <hi>Trojans</hi> accuse themselves of this iniquity <hi>apud Homer:</hi> As rendered by one, thus.</p>

The subject or the person, who did first enter into this Covenant; was the body or universality of the people themselves, &amp; then their Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in their Parliamentary capacity, like the oath of <hi>Iosua</hi> &amp; the princes which did binde the people in all time coming, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding of what they might have said for themselves, as not owneing the same, but murmureing against it. Yea the <hi>King</hi> in his princely capacity sitting on his throne, with the crowne on his head, in the day of his solemne inauguration: &amp; this though there were no more, will make it a reall Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, binding the people according to that, <hi>imperator foedus percussit, videtur, populus percussisse Romanus.</hi> As King <hi>Zede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah's</hi> oath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the King of <hi>Babilon,</hi> did oblige the people: Now then seing where either the body of a land, their Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or their prince, in their severall capacities, do Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nante; the Covenant becometh reall &amp; perpetually obligeing; much more must it be so, where all these three are, &amp; so these<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oaths being Regall oaths, Parliamentary oaths, &amp; nationall oaths &amp; covenants, they must be covenants perpetually obligeing; so that as long as <hi>Scotland</hi> hath a <hi>King</hi> or a <hi>Parliament;</hi> Yea though there should be none of those, this obligation would stand, because <hi>mutato capite, maneret idem corpus:</hi> The subject would be permanent, &amp; therefore the faith of <hi>Scotland,</hi> being Engaged: so long as <hi>Scotland</hi> is <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment standeth &amp; will not be dissolved.

               <p>Memorable is thehistorie of the persidious dealing which <hi>Iohn Husse</hi> did meet with (as it it recorded by <hi>Sleidan</hi> in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Fol. 43. Edit 1559.) who in October An. 1414. Was called by <hi>Sigismund</hi> unto the Councell at <hi>Constance</hi> having the publick faith engadged for his securitie, or a saife conduct granted to him, &amp; within three weeks after he came thither, was made prisoner, with which <hi>Sigismund</hi> was offended, it being done in his absence: But being informed how there was no faith to be keeped unto hereticks, he not only misregarded the petitions of the <hi>Bohemians</hi> requesting him to keep his promise; but also condemned the said <hi>Iohn Husse</hi> to be burnt, &amp; his ashes to be scattered on the river of Rhine: Thus did that Emper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our make shipewrack of his good name, who in another case said <hi>facilius rerum quam famae jacturam subibo. i. e. I shall lose all before I lose my credite:</hi> And moreover there was a canon
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:65203:194"/>
made that no promise should be keeped unto hereticks, or to such as were suspected of heresie notwithstanding that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour should engadge his publick faith, for their saiftie, when called to any Councell: But what followed upon this perfidious dealing? When the report of the execution of <hi>Iohn Husse</hi> &amp; <hi>Ierome</hi> of <hi>prague</hi> spreadeth thorow <hi>Bohemia,</hi> there ariseth great tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults which draw to a war under the valient &amp; renouned <hi>Iohan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Zischa,</hi> which was so bloody &amp; cruell that <hi>Sigismund</hi> was forced to implore help of the Empire.</p>
               <p>Memorable is that passage in the <hi>Turk's</hi> historie, concerning the Covenant betwixt <hi>Vladislaus</hi> King of <hi>Hungary</hi> &amp; <hi>Amurath</hi> for Ten yeers peace, &amp; the consequences of the breach thereof. This <hi>Vladislaus</hi> was moved by great Kings &amp; princes, as well Mahumetans as Christians, &amp; also by <hi>Iohn Palaeologus</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> &amp; by <hi>Francis</hi> the Cardinall of <hi>florence</hi> generall of the Christian fleet, who shewed him, how low <hi>Amurath</hi> was brought, &amp; what faire advantages the Christians had; &amp; Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by <hi>Iulian</hi> the Cardinall, who had a long speach to this end, pressing him to break that Covenant, &amp; having ended his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, in name of the <hi>Pope</hi> he disannulled the league &amp; absolved <hi>Vladislus</hi> &amp; all whom it might concerne; Whereupon the war was renewed against the <hi>Turks</hi> &amp; when battell was joyned, near to <hi>Varna,</hi> the victory began to incline to the Christians, so that <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath</hi> was thinking to flee, but was stayed by a privat souldier<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; when he saw the great slaughter of his men, beholding the picture of a crucifix in the displayed banner of the Christians, he plucked the paper out of his bosome which did containe the late league, &amp; holding it up in his hand, with his eyes cast up to heaven, said. <hi>Behold thou crucified Christ, this is the league, which thy Christians, in thy name, made with me; Which they have without cause violated: Now if thou be a God, as they say thou art, and as we dreame, revenge the wrong now done unto thy name, and me; and shew thy power upon thy perjurious peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who in deeds deny thee their God.</hi> A little thereafter <hi>Vla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dislaus</hi> is killed, &amp; his head is stuck up upon the poynt of a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>are, his army is broken, <hi>Iulian</hi> the Cardinall is found mortally wounded by the way side in a desert; Scarce the third part of

               <p>It is reported of <hi>Rodolphus</hi> duke of <hi>Suevia</hi> that being instigat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Pope,</hi> he waged ware against <hi>Henry</hi> the 4th Emperour of <hi>Germany,</hi> contrary to his oath, having a crown sen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

all by-gones, but thereafter he treacherously killed the nobles, at a feast unto which he had invited them. But what followed upon this? The body of the Land rose up in armes against him, &amp; he was killed in battell. Thus did God pursue him for his perfidy. It is recorded by <hi>Buchan:</hi> on the life of <hi>Gregorius</hi> that the <hi>Britans</hi> after they had made a peace with the <hi>Scots,</hi> did break their Covenant, &amp; invaded the <hi>Scots;</hi> But divine vengeance pursued them for this; for they were broken &amp; defate by <hi>Gregory</hi> at <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Though
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:65203:198"/>

Let this be given, though it cannot be granted: Yet this case will not help his cause; because it can hold good in no other things, but such, in which the inferiour is subordinat to the superiour, &amp; is by the law of God subject unto him, as the doughter, in the matter of her marriage, or the like, is subjected unto her parents; &amp; the married wife, in the disposall of domestick goods &amp; affaires, is subjected unto her husband: but in matters of religion &amp; in morall duties, no wife is so subjected unto her husband nor doughter unto her parents, as that they can loose the obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their vowes &amp; promises; Yea in this case it will be easily ganted that inferiours may vow &amp; Covenant, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without, but even against the command of superiours, for it is alwayes better to obey God then men; Now it hath been showne above that these Covenants are about morall duties &amp; matters of religion wherein inferiours are not to waite upon

Ios. 24. Deut.</hi> 29: 3. By this meanes this author would take away this piece of God's worship &amp; service, of vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp; swearing unto him, for it must either be about things necessary or about things indifferent: But he will have no oath
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:65203:199"/>
or vow made about things necessary, because (sayes he) that is needlesse; nor will he have any oath or vow made about things indifferent, as shall be seen afterward; &amp; so if he speak truth, there ought to be no vowes or oaths, at all. 4. But why may not people look even to the Covenant obligation, in things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the word? Doth not God lay the breach of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant oftentimes unto the charge of his people? &amp; doth not this say that they were bound to look to their promises &amp; obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations? It is true that oaths &amp; Covenants should not be the only ground upon which to plead the lawfulnesse of such or such things; yet these promises vowes &amp; Covenants, ought to have their own secondary place. So then, it is a poor thing to say that such as plead, for the standing force &amp; obligation of the Covenant, must suppone that <hi>Episcopacy</hi> is <hi>a</hi> thing indifferent; for by this same reason, they must suppone also that the other great duties, which are engadged to, in that Covenant, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to true religion &amp; a holy life, from which (himself sayeth, Pag. 37.) no power on earth can loose, &amp; to which they are indispensably tyed, are of an indifferent nature; which were most reasonlesse &amp; absurd. 5. This is a hard case unto which this author would bring the Covenanters, viz. That either they must quite the obligation of the Covenant, or else say that all those particulars sworne to, in the second article: (which is the article he mainely instanceth) are but matters of indifferency and consequently say, that not only prelacy in it's height, as <hi>Hierarchicall,</hi> but <hi>poperie heresie, schisme,</hi> &amp; <hi>every thing which is contrary to sound doctrine</hi> &amp; <hi>the power of godlinesse,</hi> are matters of indifferencie. But would he say so in his own case. If one who had taken the oath of alleagiance, or fidelity, to his law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full prince, or the oath <hi>de fideli administratione,</hi> in some of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice or other, should afterward alledge that these bondes did not binde him, for either the matter there obliged to, was a thing indifferent, &amp; if so, he was not bound to wrong his liberty, or else duties antecedent to the oath, &amp; then the oath, hath no force on him, &amp; he is no way perjured, though he crosse a hundered of those oaths: Now what will this author reply in this case; hath he not (as it is usuall for such as plea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

for error) in seeking to wound the Covenanters, killed himself, &amp; what evasions he findeth out for subjects to reject all the bondes of oaths imposed by superiours, every one seeth: And whether in so doing he doth his Maj. good service, &amp; Acteth the part of a loyall subject, and faithfull casuist, any may judge.</p>
               <p>But to proceed in the examination of the case set downe 4. Let this also be given unto this Author, though it may not be granted, he will not gaine his cause for let it be supponed that <hi>Episcopacy</hi> is a thing indifferent, will it thence follow that the Church may not determine, in a matter of indifferencie, concerning Church government, without the supreme Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrat's expresse consent? Whether is the Church or the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrat, the fittest judge of that government, which best suiteth the Church, &amp; tendeth most to edification, &amp; is most expedient? whether are the Churches that live under the <hi>Turk,</hi> more able to judge of the most expedient edifying way of Church govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or the <hi>Turk</hi> himself? If he reply That he speaketh of Christian Magistrats. It is answered That heathens are as es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentially Magistrats, as Christians are, &amp; that text <hi>Numb.</hi> 30. groundeth no more an analogy for Christian Magistrats, then for heathens: And if that be a law, then he would remember that <hi>non est distinguendum ubi lex non distinguit,</hi> &amp; that Christians may be subjects unto heathen Magistrats, is beyond all quest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion: And therefore if this argueing hold good, a Christian Church living under the <hi>Turk,</hi> might not vow to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and follow such a forme of Church government, as they judged most agreeable to the word of God, most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious for the ends of government, because, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth, it were a prejudging of the right of the great <hi>Turk</hi> their superiour. If he reply that the case is altered because of the <hi>Turk's</hi> granting liberty unto these Churches, to do in these things as they think meet <hi>Ans.</hi> Then the <hi>Turk</hi> is a better friend unto the Church, then the Christian Magistrat; &amp; it were better for the Church to be under the <hi>Turk</hi> then under a Christian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strat. 5. Let all this be yet granted, by way of supposition, he will not gaine his poynt, for their oath in this Covenant doth
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:65203:200"/>
not prejudge the right of the superiour; because they sweare only to endeavour, in their severall places &amp; callings, such &amp; such alterations, &amp; what incroachment can this make upon the superiours right? May not a wife or a doughter sweare, in their places, &amp; according to their callings, to endeavour the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of such or such a thing in the family, &amp; yet never attempt it, without the consent of the parent or husband? May not here oath be lawfull, &amp; binde h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

So that what ever he be pleased to say, of the way of <hi>Scotland</hi> their carrying on that businesse (in which how sowlely he er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, may be showne hereafter) were it granted to him, will make nothing against the Covenant, concerning the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which, is the difference now. Till then he make it appear that the Covenant, as worded, did directly prejudge the right of the superiour, his alledgiance is frivolous. &amp; ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse. 6. This might be granted to him also (which yet cannot be done) &amp; his cause gaine no advantage, &amp; that for this reason; Because that place <hi>Numb.</hi> 30. Exponed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his owne glosse &amp; commentary, maketh for the Covenanters every way: For. 1. They had no open dissent declared: It is true there is mention made of a proclamation declareing it unlawfull to enter into that Covenant but <hi>Mr Crofton</hi> in his <hi>Analepsis Analephthe. Pag.</hi> 120. sayeth that it was not regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, being done without the advice of his Councell, who are vailed by the session of Parliament, &amp; sheweth also how it was a breach of privilege. But as to that, this may satisfie. That as that proclamation did not anull the act, but only prohibite it, so it did not concerne them in <hi>Scotland.</hi> Now if the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent or husband hold his peace, the oath is confirmed <hi>requiritur</hi> (sayeth <hi>doct Sanders. de jur. prom. obl. prael. 4. §. 6.

This dissent must be presently testified in the very day he heareth thereof; if one day passe, the oath is ratified; for (sayeth the forcited <hi>Doct.

This dissent must be constant (as sayeth the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited author) for if at any time thereafter he yeeld, the oath standeth in force; for his former dissenting did not make the oath no oath, nor loosed its obligation; But only hindered the execution, &amp; so now the impediment being removed, the oath should be followed forth; &amp; what is promised therein should be performed: And the Covenanters have this to say, That the King gave his after consent unto the oath when he said in his soliloquies. <hi>That good men should least offend God &amp; him in keeping of it.</hi> But to put this out of all doubt, The King who now is (as was showne above) did solemnely owne this Covenant, &amp; approve of all that was done in carrying on the ends of it, &amp; promised that he would look upon the friends of the Covenant, as his only friends; &amp; the enemies there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of as his enemies. And now, <hi>quod semel placuit amplius dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicere non debet, that which once pleased cannot againe displease him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to this the author replyeth thus. <hi>It would be considered if it was the Lord's minde in that law, That if Children or wiver having vowed, should by some meanes drive their parents or husbands out of the house,—and bargane with them either to ratify their vowes, or never to enjoy these comforts, that then the consent so obtained should be irrevocable.

But what was there in either of those diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from this oath? all the question is about <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> &amp; was not Episcopacy abolished fully by act of Parliament, &amp; by an act of Parliament ratified &amp; opproved by King <hi>Charles</hi> the first himself, being personally present <hi>Anno</hi> 1641? &amp; so, was not this a received &amp; an approved law, as full &amp; formall, as ever any law made by any Parliament in <hi>Scotland</hi> was? And what wrong was it then to put this <hi>King</hi> to sweare to rule them by their owne approved &amp; allowed lawes? By this, it may be seen that Reverend &amp; learned Mr <hi>Crofton</hi> &amp; the authors of <hi>the Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters plea,</hi> are mistaken through misinformation, when indirec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, at least, they alledge, or take it for granted that the Scots dealt uncivilly &amp; disloyally with their prince in this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse? &amp; the reader must be intreated to look on that escape, as flowing from no ill will which they carry unto the Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of <hi>Scotland,</hi> but meerly from want of information, though it had been wished that they had forborne to have vented in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lik any such reflexion, untill they had been better informed.

               <p>But this author goeth on &amp; sayeth. <hi>It would be considered whether this be</hi> de jure naturali, <hi>that a consent of a superiour once given to the vow of an inferiour, he hath no power to revoke his consent upon reasonable causes, and to make void the vow: Lessius thinketh the precept is</hi> eatenus <hi>judiciall Ans.</hi> He would gladly put to his <hi>Amen</hi> unto this if he did not feare to be hissed at: What <hi>Lessius</hi> or any of his stamp say, is not very materiall: But whereas he thinketh that that part of it is judiciall, he had done better if he had given one word of reason for it: But if he thinketh that that part of it is judiciall, what if others think that the rest of it is judiciall also, &amp; so it be wholly laid aside as judiciall? But who ever these great schollers are who think that the supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour may revoke his consent, it is too too apparent that they are not great divines, who would teach people thus to falsify their oaths &amp; promises, nor are they good royalists, who with Matchiavell (who sayeth <hi>Princes should not have vertue, piety, faith, religion or integrity; yea that it is dangerous to them to use those alwayes, &amp; that it is necessary sometimes for them to do contrary to their faith and promise and turne with the winde)</hi> would teach Kings to take their word againe when as.

If this doctrine of his hold good, It shall be hard to know what matter it should be, about which, an oath should be taken; for he said before, that an oath hath no force in matters mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally good; and it is granted by all, that an oath hath no force in matters sinfull, for it cannot be <hi>vinculum iniquitatis;</hi> &amp; here he sayeth a man may not sweare in things indifferent, if they be such as come under the compasse of legislators, and thus he doth much to banish all religious oaths out of the world, 4. Will no oath binde, which is against the lawes of the
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:65203:203"/>
land? then what if a man in straite for money, shall borrow &amp; promise with an oath, to give more annual-rent therefore, then the law of the land will allow; will not his oath binde him?

This oath (even as to the 2. Article which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>is most controverted) was not against, but conforme unto the wholesome lawes of the land; for befor that the league &amp; cov. was sworne there were standing lawes against prelacy, &amp; acts ratified &amp; approved with all formalities, &amp; pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished with all usuall solemnities, according to the King's own command &amp; warrand; &amp; therefore this case doth not come home to the case in hand. But he sayeth <hi>it is not materiall whether the lawes be made before, or after the oath.</hi> And that is a very

                  </gap> taken in a particular about which there is no law yet made, can not be an oath against a wholesome law of the land: And to' say that a law made afterward may loose the obligation of an oath, is a very ready way for opening the door to all perjury, &amp; to cast all oaths loose; for when once a man hath sworne to his own hurt, &amp; would gladly be rid of his oath he hath no more to do, but acquant his superiour, &amp; he will make a law for the contrary, &amp; so he is at liberty; But will such sigleaves cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the nakednesse of perjurie? Or will such shifts satisfy in the day of reckoning? Dreame of those things who will, God will not be mocked?

Though it were granted (which will not be) that inferiours could not take an oath in those matters that fall under the power of legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to enact lawes about, or if they did sweare, were not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to performe, what they swore; yet if legislators them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves sweare that such a thing (suppon it be but indifferent) shall never be enacted in a law, will not this oath binde those legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slators? What will this advocat invente in this case, as an open door at which, both King &amp; Parl, may escape, for both King &amp; Parl. in their kingly &amp; parliamentary capacity have abjured pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy? 8. Why may not inferiours sweare when they finde any law grievous &amp; burdensome, to endeavour according to their place &amp; power to have such a law or Act altered? &amp; why may not such an oath oblige? This is not an oath properly against a law: &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause here the dominion of superiours over inferiours is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently reserved, this cannot be condemned. 9. He mistaketh that case of casuists <hi>quando res non permanet in eodem statu.</hi> When he applyeth it to the purpose in hand; for prelacy is the same now which it was when first abjured, there is no conveniency or law

And yet the oath must be keeped, this law being a particular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, &amp; so far only, to binde the conscience, as it might be obeyed without any breach of the morall law; as in <hi>Rachab's</hi> case it is evident (as sayeth, <hi>Mr Iackson</hi> in his annotations on <hi>Ios.</hi> 9: 18.) How will this advocat reply to these things? If he stand to his principles, he must condemne <hi>Iosua</hi> for keeping that oath. Moreover was not the oath of <hi>Zedekiah</hi> against the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall lawes of the land, seing it was tendered to him, <hi>that the Kingdom might be base, Ezek.</hi> 17: 14. &amp; yet being taken it must be keeped.

                  </hi> as much to say, for the looseing of himself from his oath? <hi>viz.</hi> that the keeping of the oath did hinder him from performing that duty to his Kingdome &amp; countrey, unto which he was pre-obliged' But this new coined divinity was not of force in those dayes, &amp; his bare word will not make it passe now with tender consciences. 5. What is the greater good which it will hinder? <hi>It will hinder</hi> (as he thinketh) <hi>their obedience to the civill Magistrat.</hi> But are all bound to obey the Magistrat in all things that are indifferent? Doth every law of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strat binde the conscience? subjection, it is true, is necessary: but not obedience Active, &amp; subjection may consist with obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:65203:205"/>
passive, that is, in suffering the penalty, when Active obedience cannot be given to the command: passive obedience is consistent with the publick peace, &amp; doth no way hurt the majesty, honour or credite of the ruler. So that though standing to this oath, may now hinder Active obedience unto that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Magistrat, enjoyning, a countenanceing of, &amp; a concurring with the abjured prelacy; yet it will not hinder subjection or passive obedience, &amp; this is all, which in those po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive indifferent things they can be said to be obliged unto, unlesse he would say (which yet he darre not) that the prelacy which was abjured, is a government commanded of God to be perpetually practised in the Church. 6. It would be considered al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so that their standing to this oath doth no way hinder their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Magistrat, in any thing commanded of God, or in any indifferent positive thing, save in this one particular (if so be this must goe under that name of indifferent things) &amp; then the true question is not; whether is it a greater good to disobey Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrats, then to keep an oath? But whether is it a greater good to obey the Magist. in this one particular of imoraceing that prelacy which was abjured, or to stand to the oath? And that will come to this, whether is it a greater good for Church or common wealth to have prelats, then to want them? &amp; if this advocat will make this the question, there will be some found who shall willingly undertake the disput. But if what is past, &amp; what is present be called in to give judgment in this matter, the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion will quickly be decided, yea &amp; appear to indifferent beholders, to be already determined: If the persecution of godly faithfull Ministers of the Gospell; If the laying of countreysides waste &amp; desolate; If the feeding of people with winde &amp; lies; If the great increase of atheisme, armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianisme, popery, ignorance, &amp; prophanity of all sorts: If the persecuting of the godly &amp; of godlinesse; If the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of the exercise of religion &amp; Christian dueties, &amp; the like, may have any weight in casting the scale. 7. As for the preaching of the Gospell, it is true, it is the duety of Ministers to be mindeing that; But God hath need of no man's sin to worke his work, he calleth no man to preach the Gospell, by
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:65203:206"/>
the way of perjury; yea their suffering now for truth tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to the furtherance of the Gospell, as, <hi>phil.</hi> 1: 12. &amp; is much more edifying then all their preaching could be, after they had proclamed their perjury unto the would. 2. Whose fault is it, that Ministers cannot have liberty to preach the Gospell? Is their keeping of the oath the thing which stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the way? Is there no other way for one to have liberty to preach the Gospell, but by breaking his oath? what influence hath the conscientions observing of the oath upon non-preaching? What if that iniquity, which is established for a law, were taken out of the way? Would there not be preaching of the Gospell, notwithstanding of a conscientious observation of the oath? there is no doubt of this. So that it is not the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the oath, which hindereth the preaching of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, otherwayes it would alwayes have done it, &amp; will alway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es do it, which is false: But some other thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; now let the blame of not preaching the Gospell, lye where it should lye, for there it will lye, whether he will or not. Yea the conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious observation of this oath is so far from lying in the way of preaching the Gospell, that on the contrary, the breach of the oath doth incapacitate a man for preaching of the Gospell both before God &amp; men: perjury is no qualification of a minister be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, &amp; who can trust or commit their soulls unto a perjured man? How can such an one who hath once so pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pably perjured himself presume ever to set his feet within a pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit againe? And thus it is clear that this case maketh noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against the Covenanters, &amp; so the first assault which he hath made upon the Covenant is repulsed very easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>The next ground which he layeth down is this. <hi>That if the Covenant be not rigidly interpreted &amp; strained, it will not hind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er a complying with the present prelacy,</hi> &amp; that upon these two grounds. 1. <hi>At the time of the taking of the Covenant there was no such Church officers in Scotland, as are mentioned in the 2. Article; &amp; therefore Scotland did not need to swear to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour their extirpation.</hi> And 2. <hi>The Parliament of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land the giver of this oath, intended nothing lesse then the extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

of all kindes of prelacy &amp; Bishops in the Church,</hi> &amp; for this he bringeth in the authors of <hi>the Covenanters plea, Mr Baxter, Mr Gataker,</hi> &amp; <hi>Mr Vines</hi> as confirming this notion of his. Unto all which a short answere may suffice, for though it might be easily demonstrated that those men mentioned by him, do not approve of that species of Episcopacy which is no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ch will speak out their judgment of the complyance of the. 2. Article of the league &amp; Covenant with the <hi>Scottish</hi> Episcopacy, yet it doth not much concerne these in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to search &amp; to try narrowly what is the judgment of any particular divine how eminent soever in <hi>England,</hi> concerning prelacy. Nor what sense or glosse they put upon the Covenant, or upon any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular article thereof; Though it is very probable that they will not put such a favourable interpretation upon that article, as shall make it an interpretation, not <hi>aequitate temperatam,</hi> but <hi>Gratia corruptam.</hi> Yea nor is it of much concernment to these of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to search after the sense or glosse, which the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> did put upon it (though no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence can be apprehended betwixt their sense, &amp; the sense of the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland)</hi> seing they did not tender that oath unto <hi>Scotl.</hi> but they are to look rather unto the sense &amp; glosse which the Church &amp; state of <hi>Scotland</hi> in their publick meetings did put upon it, &amp; it is clear that they intended no complyance betwixt the Covenant &amp; this prelacy. Though, it is true, at the taking of the Covenant, there was no such officers as are there named, in <hi>Scotland.</hi> (Which is all the weak ground he goeth upon as to this particular) yet, albeit <hi>Scotland</hi> had gotten those un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hallowed plants plucked up &amp; cas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>en out, they were not out of all fear of them. The dangerous Estate of the Church &amp; Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> at that time, said they were not without feares that these plants might againe take rooting, if the popish prelaticall &amp; malignant faction had prevailed in the Kingdomes. And therefore they were called to fortifie themselves against those plagues &amp; evills, by a solemne league &amp; Covenant. But moreover doth not the very words of the second article expresly exclude the prelacy which
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:65203:207"/>
is now in <hi>Scotland?</hi> Is not the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> at present governed by two Archbishops and by tuelue other bishops? Have not those bishops their deanes, their arch deacons, &amp;c. And is not the 2d. article expresly against such a government by such officers? Who that hath eyes in their heads can doubt of these things? Moreover will he suppose that the Church and state of the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> were such <hi>ignoramuses,</hi> as to set down contradictories in the Covenant, &amp; that when they had sworne to maintaine the discipline &amp; government of the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> (which himself will confesse was presbyterian) in the first article, &amp; in the second article had abjured a government in the Church, inconsistent with presbyterian government; should be thought with all to consent &amp; yeeld unto such an episcopacy, as should be inconsistent with presbyterian government? Which were in effect to say, They swore to maintaine presbyterian govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment &amp; yet might receive another government distinct from, &amp; inconsistent with presbyterian government: And though they abjured prelacy; yet not every prelacy, for they might for all that, accept of one sort of prelacy which yet should be incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with presbyterian government. But possibly this advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat saw he would be ashamed of such things, &amp; therefore went to <hi>England</hi> to seek such help as he could finde, but all the help he hath gotten there, hath made little to his purpose. Finally this author would do well to follow D. <hi>Sand.</hi> his advice <hi>ubi sup. prael.</hi> 2 § 9. where he discourseth thus <hi>when I say an oath is</hi> stricti juris <hi>that is to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>When thus he hath spent his master pieces, against this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, he cometh, in end, to try what his third &amp; last device will do, &amp; that is, to muster up some stragling faults which he espieth either as to matter or manner; which though granted to him, would not much advantage his cause, or say much for looseing the obligation of the oath, now after it is taken: Yet because he vapoureth much in his expressions here, &amp; would gladly deceive the simple, who are not well acquanted with the nature of oaths, but are ready to think that the least escape in the manner of entering into an oath, is enough to dissolve its obligation, after it is taken, not knowing that <hi>quod sicri non debuit factum valet,</hi> nor knowing well how to guaird against this deceit, which he hideth with a multitude of words; his challenges must be answered.</p>
               <p>All which he sayeth on this head, is some thing to these three particulars. 1. The want of authority, in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseing. 2. The generality of the termes in which it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. &amp; 3. Some incongruitie in the 3d article.</p>

But by his favour they must first be convinced of the errour ere they can say that they have erred, and ere they be convinced of an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in that Particular, they must see more cogent arguments then any which he hath yet brought: For as for that committee of Estates which he sayeth did carry on that Covenant in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> it had power for that effect from the convention of Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates, &amp; their deed was approven in all poynts by the next meeting of Parliament, <hi>Anno</hi> 1644. the lawfulnesse of which convention &amp; Parliament hath been shown above (and as for the Parliament of <hi>England, Mr Croften</hi> &amp; <hi>Timorcus</hi> have suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently spoken to that) and as for <hi>Scotlands</hi> entering into a lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue with <hi>England</hi> without the King's consent, it hath been vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated before: So hath it been showne how the Parliaments of <hi>Scotland</hi> do partake of the soveraignity with the King and have power of warre, &amp; so all which he here sayeth is answered already: Only because he desireth some examples of the like among <hi>Iewes</hi> or <hi>Christians,</hi> though there be no great necessity for this businesse, yet some few instances shall be brought &amp;

That in <hi>February</hi> 1547. the nobles of <hi>Boheme</hi> meeting at <hi>Prague</hi> entered into a Covenant among themselves for the defence of their liberty, whether <hi>Ferdinand</hi> would or not.</p>
               <p>The second particular is about the generality of the termes wherein the Covenant is expressed. The summe of what he sayeth here is this. <hi>The Covenant was purposely framed in generall and homonymous termes that all the sects might lurck under it; And so the Sectarian army when they invaded Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land did pretend the Covenant; And presbyterian Government was no way secured, it not being once named, but wrapped up in generall, under the reformation in doctrine, worship, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline &amp; Government, unto which independents &amp; separatists might assent, purposeing to preserve the same against the common enemy, yea even such as entered into the Covenant could not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in its sense as may be seen in the Parliament of</hi> England's <hi>baffling the Scottish Commissioner's declaration; Anno 1647. &amp; other papers. Ans.</hi> 1. To say that the Covenant was purpose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly framed in generall termes, that severall parties might be fast united against prelacy, is a base &amp; slanderous imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, But suteth him well who pleadeth for such a cause; If the Covenant, for the most part, be thus conceived in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall &amp; ambiguous termes, how cometh it to passe, that he
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:65203:209"/>
produceth not instances thereof, no not so much as one? Was it not as cleare as the sun shineth at noon day, that the reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed government of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> at that time, was presbyteriall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And did not himself say a little before, that at that time there was no such officers in the Church of <hi>Scotl.</hi> as are mentioned in the second article of the league &amp; Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant? And whereas he sayeth that severall sects did lurk under the lap thereof, doth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>he think this a cogent argument to prove it's ambiguity? What sect is it which doth not plead scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? Shall scripture therefore be accounted ambiguous <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> No not at all. Let men of corrupt mindes &amp; principles wrest words in the Covenant as they please, the Covenant, to any who shall reade it, is plaine &amp; clear enough, &amp; he who will wink, may wander at noon day: let men imagine &amp; put what glosses they will on scripture, It is plaine, &amp; hath but one sense. But what will all this make to the businesse? Will the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Covenant, in which some men think there lyeth some ambiguities, be loosed upon that account? This must be proved ere it be received off his hand, as a truth: neither he, nor any of his party hath hit hertill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> attempted any such thing. Lastly is there any ambiguity in the second article? <hi>Yet</hi> (say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth he) <hi>were it not better to lay aside (when now it is disclamed, by Ki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

not to protect others from the wrath &amp; vengeance of God.</p>
               <p>The last particular which he exaggerateth is the limited or conditionall preservation of the King's Maj. person &amp; au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, viz. <hi>in the preservation &amp; defence of the true religion, &amp;c.</hi> He enquireth whether this was right or not? And if difference in religion loose a people from their duty to the King? To which a short reply will suffice. 1. Though it were granted that there were some thing wrong here, this will not ground the non-obligation of the Covenant in other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, &amp; what hath he gained then? 2. What ever wrong may be in wording this article thus, The blame is not be laid upon the first authors of this league &amp; Covenant; For in the nationall Covenant (which was subscribed at first by King <hi>Iames</hi> &amp; his houshold, <hi>Anno</hi> 1580. And in obedience to an act of Councell together with an Act of the Generall Assembly, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of all rankes, <hi>Anno</hi> 1581. And againe subscribed by all sorts of persons, <hi>Anno</hi> 1590. 1591.) The Covenanters duety towards the King is so qualified in these words. <q>We protest &amp; promise with our hearts under the same oath, hand write, &amp; paines, that we shall defend his person &amp; authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, with our gear, bodyes &amp; lives, in the defence of Christ's evangell, liberties of our contrey, ministration of justice; &amp; punishment of iniquity, against all enemies within th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> realme or without.</q> So that if he annull the leagué &amp; Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant upon this account, he must much more annull the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall Covenant, whereof King <hi>Iames</hi> was the author: For in that there is more add<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>d to the qualification of their duty to the King, viz. his <hi>minisiration of justice and punishment of jui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi> So then this clause in the <hi>league</hi> being consonant unto that in the <hi>nationall Covenant</hi> needeth not be so much quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled at. 3. It is like he is displeased with any such qualification, but his reason is not very forceable <hi>viz.</hi> because <hi>it would insinuat that they were no otherwayes bound to defend him,</hi> for it will only insinuat that the Covenanters are to preferre, that which is of greater moment unto that which is of lesser concernment, &amp; that they are to preferre the end unto the mean leading to the end; That is, when the King is in direct op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:65203:210"/>
unto the cause &amp; work of God, it becometh them to preferre the interest of <hi>Christ</hi> before man's, &amp; not to help the mighty against the Lord, but the Lord against the mighty: And when defending, promoveing, or any way advanceing the authority of the King, shall directly tend to the ruine of the interest of Christ, &amp; religion, no Christian is bound to concurre: And this was granted even by the Parliament, <hi>Anno</hi> 1648. So that the question betwixt the Parliament &amp; the Church, at that time, was not whether religion, &amp; the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests of <hi>Christ</hi> should be preferred to the interest of the <hi>King;</hi> or not: But whether the Engadgement, which was then car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed on, was not a preferring of <hi>Man's</hi> interests to <hi>Christ's<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Was it found Doctrine to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuat (to the sense of intelligent men) that we were not otherwise bound to defend him? Was it well by such a clause to give occasion to wicked men to think they were no furder obliged to him then he should desend that which they accounted religion.]</q>  And that the folly of his consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesmay furder appear, it would be considered that there is a clear difference betwixt these two: Owneing of the King, &amp; defending his authority, never, but when he is actually owne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp; active for the cause &amp; interest of <hi>Christ:</hi> And owne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the King, &amp; defending his authority, alwayes, but when he is in actuall opposition, &amp; in a stated contradiction to the work &amp; interest of <hi>Christ,</hi> So is there a difference betwixt these two. Non-concurrence in defending &amp; promoveing of the King's authority, when he is opposeing the work of God: And actuall anulling, diminishing, or utter overthrowing of his power &amp; authority when he is so stated: And so when the Covenanters say That they are not bound to contribute their power in their places &amp; capacities, to promove or defend his Maj. power, &amp; authority; when he is in a stated opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the work of God, &amp; when the advanceing of him to his full power &amp; authority, would cetanely tend to the ruine &amp; desruction of the cause &amp; people of God: yet they do not say, that they are never bound to defend him, but when he is actually promoveing &amp; advanceing the work of God, according to his full power &amp; place; Nor do they say, that when he opposeth the work of God, they are at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to destroy his person, or to spoile &amp; rob him of all his just power &amp; authority: And therefore both that clause in the
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:65203:211"/>
Covenant, &amp; their proceedings may be abundantly justified without laying down any ground for the taking away of the late King's life; &amp; without clashing with, or contradicting the confessions of protestant Churches, or of their owne; so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> still they acknowledge that difference in Religion doth not make void the Magistrat's just &amp; legall Authority, not free the people from subjection: But that this may be a little more clear, let this example be considered: A Father turneth phrenticke &amp; mad, &amp; seeketh to destroy the whole family, calling for a sword, &amp; liberty to execute his cruelty; His sones rise up &amp; binde his hands, &amp; withhold the sword from him, &amp; withall sweare to stand together in their own defence, &amp; to defend their Father's just right &amp; power in the defence of the family: Now, in this case, can any say that they were undu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull children; or that their covenanting so, &amp; adding that clause in the Covenant, sayeth, they were free to cast off the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is betwixt him &amp; them, except he guide the family, in all poynts as they would have him doing? No in no wayes. Here then it is clear that their refuseing to put the sword in their Father's hand, while under this distemper, is no act of undutifulnesse; It is no lessening of the Father's just power over the family, nor doth it say that they thinke themselves not bound to owne him as a Father, except when he is actively, promoveing the good of the family, &amp; far lesse doth it say, that they think, because of this distemper, they may destroy him, or that the relation betwixt them &amp; him is broken up for ever. So then, though this Advocat thought he had a faire sield to walk upon, &amp; a faire occasion to vent his anger against that Church, &amp; to make her odious to all Churches about, yet wise men, who easily see that there is no such strong relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt King &amp; subjects, as betwixt Parents &amp; Children, will acknowledge that his ranting is without reall ground; And that <hi>Scotland</hi> in their treaties with the King at the <hi>Hage,</hi> &amp; at <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> &amp; in their actions at home did nothing but what they may hold up their faces for, both before God &amp; Man, doing noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herein; which either contradicteth their own confession of faith, or the confession of faith of other Churches. Not
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:65203:212"/>
their own confession of faith; For if the large confession of faith be viewed (which was approved by the Parliament &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert in their registres.) In that head of the civill Magistrate these words shall be found, <hi>We confesse and avow, that such at resist the supreme power doing that thing which appertaineth to his charge, do resist God's ordinance, and therefore cannot be guiltlesse: &amp; furder we affirme that whosoever deny unto them their aide coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell and comfort, whiles the Princes and rulers vigilantly travell in execution of their office, that the same men deny their help support and counsell to God, who by the presence of his lifetenant doth crave it of them.</hi> So that all the resisting which is there condemned, is resisting of him while doing his duty &amp; executing his office, &amp; not, while he is seaking to destroy Religion, &amp; the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests of <hi>Christ.</hi> Nor the confession of other Churches, for in the former confession of <hi>Helvetia,</hi> upon that head of the civill Magistrate, they say (as it is in the English edition) <hi>We know that though we be free, we ought wholly in a true faith, holily to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ourselves, to the Magistrate, both with our body and with all our goods, and endeavour of minde also, to performe faithfulnesse, and the oath which we made to him, so far forth</hi> (N.

That these Ministers who rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned with the Doctors of <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> denyed indeed, that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacy was expresly &amp; specifically abjured, in the later part of the Covenant, which was the addition containeing the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation unto the present times; But did never say that it was not abjured in the negative confession, or nationall Covenant: Now it was about that application &amp; addition, that the debate arose betwixt these Ministers &amp; the Doctors; The Doctors never refused to subscribe the negative confession, as it was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, or the Covenant drawne up <hi>Anno</hi> 1580, &amp; 1581. for when the privy Councell did emit a declaration, enjoyning all to take the Covenant, as it was taken <hi>Anno</hi> 1580, 1581, &amp; 1590, &amp; 1591. as others did not, so neither would they have scrupled at the same: But they alwayes refused to subscribe to that part which was added, and one of the grounds, why they did scruple at the subscribeing of that, was this. They thought that by that addition, they should be bound expresly, directly, &amp; specifically to abjure Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, &amp; the ceremonies of <hi>Perth,</hi> which (as they sayd) they could not in conscience do; Because then they should not have liberty to vote freely, according to their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Concerning those things, in the Generall Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly: And unto this the Ministers answered: that the words of that addition were purposely so contrived as none might scruple upon that account; And indeed as to Prelacy the words run thus <hi>that they should forbear the approbation of the corruptions of the publick Government of the Kirk.</hi> And the reason was, because there were severall honest &amp; well minded people in the land, who could not distinctly &amp; clearly see, that the ceremonies, &amp; the Government of the Church by prelats, were directly, contrary to the confession of faith, &amp; abjured therein; But were waiting for light in those mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, from the ensueing Generall assembly, who, they knew, could give most clearnesse in the matter of fact; And could best show what was the Government of the Church, at that

time when the nationall Covenant was first subscribed; And also what was the meaning of the reformers as to severall parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars in that Covenant. So then, though it be true, that by taking of the oath, or swearing that additionall explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Anno</hi> 1638, No man was bound up from reasoning &amp; debateing, nor from free voteing in the matter of prelacy in the nationall Assembly: Yet it will not follow that prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy was not abjured, by the negative confession or nationall Covenant; for though the sense &amp; meaning of the oath <hi>Anno</hi> 1581, Was not alike clear unto all, <hi>Anno</hi> 1638. Either as concerning prelacy or ceremonies: Yet the Covenant did strick against those as was afterward cleared. The Covenant hath still one sense &amp; meaning, though such as did live fifty &amp; eight yeers after it was first drawn up, could not alike see it &amp; discerne it. It was but little wonder that at such a distance of time, after so many revolutions, the true sense &amp; meaning thereof could not be so obvious unto all, As to overcome all doubts &amp; scruples; And therefore it was prudently resolved, to suspend their approbation of those particulars, till they were tryed in free assemblies: And indeed so soon as the Assembly 1638 Did search into the businesse, &amp; cleare the true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Covenant, according to the sense of the reformers all scruples were loosed, &amp; the people did chearfully assent unto the Assemblies determination; For then they saw that by that Covenant, The Ceremonies of <hi>Perth</hi> Assembly, &amp; the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church by prelats, were abjured. And it may be supposed, that this author will not be so bold as to say that ever after that assembly, wherein that businesse was cleared, any said that such as took that Covenant, were left at liberty to vote for prelacy, or for the ceremonies. So then this author bewrayeth much ignorance or maliciousnesse, or both; when he thus argueth as he doth: Let him read the answers of those Ministers in these places cited by himself, &amp; he shall be able, if he will, to see his mistakes.</p>
               <p>One of the grounds whereupon the Assembly 1638. did determine that Episcopacy was abjured by the Covenant which was sworne, <hi>Anno</hi> 1580. &amp;c. was taken from these words in

the Covenant <hi>his wicked hierarchy,</hi> as may be seen at the end of their act sess. 16. And to this he answereth, thus. <hi>This imports not the abjuration of the office of a Bishop, more then the office of a presbyter, or deacon, which are parts of the hierarchy, as well as Bishops; but only the abjuration of the hierarchy so far as it was the pop's; as it abjureth the five bastard sacraments, So far at he maketh them sacraments: So then the dependence of these offices on him as the head of the Church under Christ, is abjured, &amp; also the corruption adhereing to these offices, and as they flow from him and are his, as is his blasphemous priesthood: And not the offices themselves: And therefore the office of a Bishop among pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants (Bishops being now loosed from that dependence upon the sea of</hi> Rome) <hi>is no part of the pope's hierarchy.</hi> This is the summe of his long discourse, and it may be shortly answered thus. That if the abjureing the hierarchy import the abjureing of the offices which are parts of the hierarchy, in so far as they depend on him, &amp; are corrupted by him, then it will fully im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the abjureing of prelats; Because prelats depend on him, as well <hi>in esse</hi> as <hi>in operari,</hi> &amp; therefore they must be abjured with this wicked hierarchy. It is well known that at the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> the Pope would not suffer it to be debated, whether Bishops were <hi>juris divini</hi> or not, &amp; the Historian <hi>Peter Suave,</hi> addeth the reason, viz. lest if it should be determined that they were <hi>juris Divini</hi> they should not so depend upon him, as they did, &amp; he would have them continueing to do: So that hence it is clear, that the <hi>Pope</hi> acknowledgeth that they depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himself alone, even in their being, &amp; have no other ground to stand upon, &amp; therefore when his hierarchy is abjured, they in their essence &amp; being are abjured. It is true, if he, or any of his fraternity, had ever demonstrated out of the word of God, that Christ or his Apostles did ever institute such an officer, distinct from a preaching presbyter, as in the prelate, as may be done concerning the <hi>Presbyter</hi> &amp;c the <hi>deacon,</hi> &amp; as himself will readily grant; Then indeed it would follow that the abjureing of the <hi>pope's hierarchy</hi> would import no more then the abjureing of those corruptions which Attend those officers, as these which attend

So that, till he demonstratively cleare, That Christ or his Apostles did institute <hi>Bishops</hi> distinct from <hi>preaching presbyters,</hi> he must acknowledge a difference betwixt them &amp; <hi>presbyters</hi> &amp; <hi>deacons,</hi> as to the matter of abjureing them: And so when all those three are abjured, they cannot be abjured after one &amp; the same manner: But the office of <hi>presbyters</hi> &amp; <hi>deacons</hi> are abjured in respect of their abuse, that is, the abuse &amp; corruption which adhereth to these officers, as they are made parts of the hierarchy, is abjured: But when <hi>prelats</hi> are abjured, not only is their abuse, or the corruption ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hereing to them, abjured; but the very use is abjured; for the use of an officer not appoynted of Christ, is an abuse, and <hi>Prelats,</hi> as to their being, depend only on the <hi>pope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But (sayes he) <hi>Bishops now being loosed from that dependence from the sea of</hi> Rome, <hi>&amp; the</hi> Pope, <hi>who as head of the Church, claimed a plenitude of power over the whole Church, &amp; made all Christian Bishops and Ministers, but as his slaves &amp; vassels, portioning out to them such measure of jurisdiction, as he thought sit, as their stiles in this countrey imported of old.</hi> Ego N.

and canonization of saints, or dedication of Altars</hi> So that the Bishops their casting off the <hi>Pope</hi> as the head of the Church, will not bring them out from among the officers, &amp; parts of that wicked <hi>hierarchy.</hi> In so far as protestant Churches admit of prelats, in so far they are unreformed from popery, this being one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

It was the prelates their depending on the <hi>Pope</hi> that made the scottish refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers condemne them, as his <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> otherwise they should have condemned all the other articles of popery, only in so far as they did depend on him, &amp; no otherwise: And so should have yeelded, that if the King, by vertue of his headshipe over the Church, should command, &amp; enjoyn the practice of any of those articles condemned in the Covenant, they might be done in obedience unto him, if they were abjured, only as they had dependence on the <hi>Pope</hi> &amp; came from him. But this is false, for they are condemned as being a part of <hi>a contrary religion and doctrine, damned and confuted by the word of God and Kirk of Scotland:</hi> &amp; so, upon the same account, are the Prelats abjured, whether they depend upon an ecclesiastick <hi>Pope,</hi> or upon a civill <hi>Pope,</hi> whether they be <hi>Apostolicae sedis gratiâ Episcopi,</hi> or <hi>Iacobi,</hi> or <hi>Car ligratiâ Episcopi,</hi> they are damned &amp; confuted by the word of God, &amp; are not <hi>Christigratiâ Episcopi:</hi> And so are abjured as unwarranted officers in the house of God; even as ordination &amp; marriage are degraded from being sacraments; so are they from being Church officers.</p>
               <p>But to put a close to this second particular, it would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, that in the Covenant, the office of prelats is abjured, when the <hi>hierarchy</hi> is abjured, the same way that <hi>confirmation</hi> &amp; <hi>extreme unction</hi> are abjured, when the five bastard sacraments are abjured; that is to say, both the use &amp; the abuse is abjured; for they both want warrand in the word, &amp; therefore ought not to be: &amp; to maintaine either, is to maintaine false Doctrine, &amp; poynts of Popery condemned in the word.

               <p>But he goeth on pag. 32. &amp; would make his reader beleeve. That King <hi>Iames</hi> the enjoyner of that Covenant did never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the abjuration of the office of Episcopacy, &amp; that for these reasons. 1.

not change in Nine or Ten Yeers time, specially it being a time of reformation, when light was breaking up more clear dayly. But next this is a more pregnant demonstration, to say King <hi>Iames</hi> intended no such thing <hi>Anno</hi> 1580. because <hi>Mr Iohn Craig</hi> had no such intention Nine Yeers before. Is not this well argued? But to the matter: It is true there were such things concluded at that meeting, but whether, with the unanimous consent of all, or not, who can tell? But be it so, that this honest man was oversweyed with the rest, by the violence of the court, &amp; some nobles who designed the <hi>Tulchan</hi> Bishope (a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Andrews</hi> two moneths thereafter, took notice of these articles &amp; did appoynt some of their number to examine them, so great was the exception which they took at them. And <hi>Anno</hi> 1572. there was a protestation against these innovations. &amp; 1573. the Assembly determined, that whatever Bishops there were, they should have no more power then the former superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendents had, &amp; censured some as the Bishops of <hi>Dunkell</hi> &amp; <hi>Galloway:</hi> And to this same purpose were there acts made <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> 1574. And <hi>Anno</hi> 1575, the office both of Bishops &amp; of superintendents came to be questioned, &amp; debated, &amp; a little thereafter they signified to the Regent, that they would not agree unto that polity condescended on at <hi>Leth,</hi> but some of their number were appoynted to draw up the second<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> book of discipline which book <hi>Anno</hi> 1577. &amp; 1578. Was fully approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: &amp; having proceeded thus far they caused severall of the Bishops subscribe severall articles denudeing themselves of their episcopall power. Now when the Church is at all this work<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> shall it be thought that this honest man (even supposeing he had been of that judgement, which cannot be proved) was still of a judgement contrary to the judgement of the Church: And did not all this time alter his minde, especially seing the Church did look upon him as a faithfull friend for presbyterian government, &amp; therefore did appoynt him with other five to

consult with, Mr <hi>Alexander Hay</hi> about the modell or plot of presbyteries? But it is not much matter to debate what was the penman's judgment at the time: the Covenant it self, &amp; the words thereof are to be considered, &amp; the meaning of the land, in taking that oath, is much to be regairded, &amp; what that was, shall be showne by &amp; by.</p>
               <p>But. 2. He sayes, pag. 33. as to King <hi>Iames.</hi> It could not be his intention to put away Bishops, <hi>Because at that time</hi> Anno 1580. <hi>there was no other Government known <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Though the King &amp; Councell had presented the confession to the Assembly to be subscribed by them, &amp; by the people, in their paris<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Now it is not probable that the King &amp; Councell, if they intended to abjure episcopacy by the confession, would within six moneshs confirme that agreement at Leth. Ans.</hi> 1. It hath been shown but just now, that severall yeers, before the yeer 1580, The Generall assemblies of that Church were declare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves against prelats, &amp; their power, &amp; were acting so far as lay in their power, (and that was much, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what opposition they did meet with) for presbyterian go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. 2. It is certaine that Church Government by prelats, was never approved by any of the generall assemblies, in those dayes. 3. Though before the yeer 1580. The Assembly did not formally passe an act against Episcopacy: Yet was it not equivalent when <hi>Anno</hi> 1577. &amp; 1578. The second book of discipline, which overturneth the Government of the Church by Bishops, was approved? 4. This same act of the Generall As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly at <hi>Dundee</hi> was before the subscribeing of the Covenant; For it was in <hi>Iuly,</hi> &amp; the Command for subscribeing of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, came not forth till the 2 <hi>March</hi> thereafter, &amp; that 2d.
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:65203:217"/>
of <hi>march</hi> was said to be, <hi>Anno</hi> 1580. as well as <hi>Iuly</hi> before, because at that time, the denomination of the new yeer did not begin in <hi>Scotland,</hi> untill the 25 of <hi>March</hi> &amp; so it is his mistake to think that the Covenant was enjoyned to be subscribed, six moneths before the Act at <hi>Dundee.</hi> 5. Whereas he sayes that, <hi>An.</hi> 1580. there was no such thing in <hi>Scotland</hi> as government by presbyteries, if he meane that that government was not setled thorow the whole Kingdom, he speaks truth; but nothing to the purpose; but if he meane, that in no part of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey there was any such government, he is mistaken; for at the assembly, <hi>Anno</hi> 1578. there was mention made of presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, for amongst the articles which this assembly drew up, to be subscribed by those prelats, whom they had caused cite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them; this was one, viz the 6. that they should not <hi>Empire over elderships but be subject to them</hi> &amp; the 7. was that they <hi>should not usurpe the power of presbyteries:</hi> So that there were presbyteries in the land, at that time: Yea the narrative of the 131.

Moreover at the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, 1579. there was a motion made about a generall order to be taken, for erecting of presbyteries in places where publick exercise was used, untill the policy of the Church were established by law: &amp; it was answered <hi>that the exercise may be judged to be a presbytery.</hi> So that the Kingdom at that time was not without presbyteries: Yea their frequent nationall assemblies, shew that the Church was governed presbyterially. 6.

               <p>But in the next place, as touching the assembly 1638. their declaration of the sense of the Covenant, he hath some what to say as. 1. <hi>That it seemeth strange that any assembly should take upon them to declare, what was the sense of the Church in taking a Covenant, when few or no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>em were members of that assembly 1638. as,</hi> juramentum est vinculum p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>rsonale; <hi>so, no man or company of men can take upon them to define, what was the sense of dead men, in taking an oath, unlesse they can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce some authentick expresse evidence that such was their meaning in taking the oath. Ans.</hi> 1. By this argueing, the sense &amp; meaning of a Covenant perisheth with the Covenant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>rs. 2. It is true <hi>juramentum</hi> or <hi>foedus personale est vinculum personale;</hi> but there is another Covenant that is called <hi>foedus reale</hi> (of which kinde this nationall Covenant was) &amp; the <hi>vinculum</hi> of this, is more then <hi>personale,</hi> it obligeth moe then such as did personally take it. 3. Therefore this Covenant being a nationall reall Covenant, obligeing the land in all time coming, posterity is called to search &amp; to see very exactly &amp; narrowly into the sense &amp; meaning of the Covenant, they are obliged to know the nature of that Covenant by which themselves stand bound before God. 4. Who is more fit to give the sense of the Church in taking a Coven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>nt, then a Generall assembly of the Church? 5. It was shown before, what was the constant judgement of the honest Ministers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the sense of this Covenant, even in the time when prelats were heighly advanced, out of this same author; &amp; so the true sense of the nationall Covenant, hath come down from father to son, amongst the honest partie, even in the most corrupt times: &amp; then, the Assembly at <hi>Glasgow</hi> was so much the more <hi>in tuto.</hi> 6. The Assembly at <hi>Glasgow</hi> did produce authentick expresse evidences, that such was the meaning &amp; sense of those, who first entered into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
               <p>To this, he is pleased to say. <hi>That all that which they produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:65203:220"/>
amounts to nothing more then this, that before; Iuly 1580. The Church had been labouring against Bishops, who notwithstanding countinued till thereafter, but all their citations prove not that Episcopacy was abjured by the Covenant or any words in it. Ans.</hi> 1. This is certaine, that in that Covenant, some Government or discipline was sworne to be continued in, &amp; defended, as the expre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>e words, before cited, do shew. 2. It is certane, that this discipline or government of the Church, was either prelacy, or presbyterian Government (there not being a third competitour) &amp; if it was prelacy, presbyterian governement, was abjured, &amp; if it was presbyterian governement, then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy was abjured. 3. It is certane, that if it were once clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, what that governement was, which the Church of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in &amp; about that time, did owne, as the only governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, it would soon be cleared what that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement was, which by this covenant they were bound to owne &amp; to continue in; &amp; consequently what governement was abjured thereby. Therefore all the difficulty is to know what that government was, which the Church did owne; &amp; yet there is no difficulty here, for it is as clear, as the sun at noonday, that it was Church governement by presbyteries, Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, &amp; assemblies, which they, both before, at, &amp; after that time did owne &amp; defend, till it was violently taken away: And if the citations of the assembly 1638, will amount to this, they will sufficiently declare that Episcopacy was abjured, at that time: And whether their citations shall do so or not, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different reader may judge, when he hath considered &amp; laid to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether these two &amp; twenty particulars, into which, the citations shall be branched forth. 1. When the Church had been wre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp; could not prevaile against Bishops, from the yeer 1571 unto the yeer 1575, &amp; being continually wearied with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints given in against them, they entered at last into a search of the office it self, &amp; did agree in this, that the name <hi>Bishop</hi> was common to every one, who had a particular flock, to which he preached &amp; administrated the sacraments; &amp; so it could not designe a distinct officer. 2. <hi>Anno</hi> 1576. the assembly did censure such prelats, as had not betaken themselves to some
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:65203:220"/>
particular flocks. 3. In the assembly 1578 the second book of discipline was unanimously agreed upon. 4, At ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther assembly, that same yeer, the moderator told <hi>Montrose, Chanceler Seaton, &amp; Lindsay. That they had drawn up, out of the pure fountaine of God's word such a discipline as was meet to remaine in this kirk.</hi> 5. At that same assembly, it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained that such as were called Bishops, should be content to be pastours of one flock; should usurp no criminall jurisdiction; should not vote in Parliament without a commission from the kirk; should not Empire over their particular elderships; &amp; should not usurpe the power of presbyteries. 6. <hi>An.</hi> 1579 The assembly judgeth that every meeting for exercise might be accounted a presbytery. 7. <hi>An.</hi> 1580. after deliberation, it was found that the office of prelats was pretended, &amp; had no warrand in the word: And they ordained that such should dimit, &amp; Leave the samine, as an office, unto which they were not called of God, &amp; this was before (as was said above,) the subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Covenant. 8. The same assembly sendeth some commissioners to his Maj. desireing that the book of policy might be established by an Act of Councell, untill the meeting of a Parliament. 9. In the assembly 1581. At <hi>Glasgow</hi> the Act of the former assembly at <hi>Dundee</hi> was explained, &amp; i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> was showne that thereby the Church did condemne the whole state of Bishops, as they were then in <hi>Scotland.</hi> 10. At this assembly the confession of faith was presented, &amp; the plot of presbyteries, with the King's letter to the noblemen &amp; gentlemen of the countrey, for furthering the erection of presbyteries: &amp; thus at the very presenting of the confession to the assembly, to be subscribed, the King &amp; the assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly agree in one judgement, as to the governement of the Church, viz. That it should be presbyteriall, &amp; according to this harmonious desire, presbyteries were erected in severall places. 11. In that same assembly, The second book of discipline was insert in the registres of the Church, &amp; immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after, the Covenant was insert; That all posterity might see that the governement, which they swore to maintaine &amp; owne in the confession or Covenant, was the same which was
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:65203:221"/>
contained in the book of discipline, &amp; thus that book of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline &amp; the confession or Covenant did harmoniously accord, 12. <hi>Anno</hi> 1581. The assembly would not suffer <hi>Mr Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomery</hi> Minister at <hi>Sterlin</hi> to become bishop of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> but commanded him to waire on his Ministery at <hi>Sterlin</hi> under the paine of excommunication. 13. In the same assembly, it was acknowledged that the Estate of Bishops was condemned by the kirk, a commission for erecting of moe presbyteries, was granted, and a new ordinance made for subscribeing the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; can any man now doubt, what that government was which the Church in those dayes owned by that Covenant? 14. <hi>Anno</hi> 1582. a new commission was granted, for erecting of moe presbyteries, &amp; Mr <hi>Montgomery</hi> for usurping the place of a bishop, was ordained to be excommunicated; for presbytery &amp; prelacy are incompatible. 15, In another assembly that same yeer, commission was given to some presbyteries to try &amp; cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure such as were called bishops, and some were sent unto the Councill to desire their approbation of an Act, for establishing of presbyteries, Synods &amp; assemblies; did the Church incline any thing to prelacy then? 16. <hi>Anno</hi> 1586. It was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined at an assembly that there are no other Church officers set down in the scripture, beside <hi>Pastors, Doctors; Elders</hi> &amp; <hi>Deacons</hi> that should be in the Church now. 17. <hi>Anno</hi> 1587. It was ordained at an Assembly, that the admission of Mr <hi>Montgomery,</hi> suppose but to the temporality of the bishoprick of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> should be annulled with all possible diligence, that slander might be removed from the Church. 18. In the same Assembly, there was a letter drawn up unto his Maj. shewing that <hi>they found the office of bishops not agreable to the word of God, but damned in diverse assemblies, 19. Anno</hi> 1590. when the confession or Covenant was subscribed universally of new, the assembly desired <hi>a ratification of the liberties of the Kirk, in her jurisdiction</hi> &amp; <hi>discipline in presbyteries, Synods, and generall assemblies.</hi> 20. It was ordained also, that all intrants should subscribe the book of discipline, especially the heads contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, &amp; also all who were presently in office, under the paine of excommunication. 21. In the assembly, 1591. the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:65203:221"/>
Act was renewed. 22. <hi>Anno</hi> 1592. commissioners were sent to attend the Parliament, &amp; to desire a rescindeing of the Acts of Parliament, <hi>Anno</hi> 1584. made in prejudice of of the Church, &amp; a ratifying of the discipline of the Church, both which were granted: now the reader may judge from these particulars, what was the sense of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> at that time, of the confession or Covenant; &amp; whether these citations amount to any thing or not; And whether or not, this author had any reason to slight, &amp; undervalue, so far as he doth, the paines taken by that reverend Assembly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to cleare the oath, according to the sense of those who first took it.</p>

That his doctrine should be examined by the meeting, &amp; if it were sound unsound, he should lose his place. That his power should only be the power of <hi>order</hi> &amp; not of <hi>jurisdiction.</hi> That withall, he should have insp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ction over moe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes, &amp; that every Minister who was to enter, should have his approbation, &amp; the approbation of those Ministers who were to be joyned with him, &amp;c. But when the assembly did meet in <hi>May</hi> thereafter, these were not assented unto. But it was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concluded That the, bishop, being a pastour, as other ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Ministers, should be tryed by the presbytery &amp; Synod, in matter of doctrine &amp; conversation; And be subject unto the Generall assemblies: &amp; when the commissioners, who were sent from his Maj. did hear of this, they dissented, &amp; protested, that nothing concluded should stand in force; seing th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>

<pb n="410" facs="tcp:65203:222"/>
where that was concluded which this author mentioneth, &amp; withall they did proceed to set down the order of the presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries: Now, lest any should stumble at this change in the Assembly, let it be considered, That two yeers before this, there was a strange change at court; for <hi>Arran</hi> ruled all, nobles were banished &amp; ministers were forced to flee, others imprisoned, &amp; then the Prelats got up their heads, <hi>Montgomerie</hi> was made Bishop of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> &amp; one Mr <hi>Adamsone</hi> made Bishop of <hi>Saint Andrews:</hi> And Ministers were compelled to promise, under their subscription, obedience unto them, &amp; to consent unto many other acts of iniquity, under the paine of banishment, confinement, imprisonm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>nt, deposition, &amp; sequestration of stipends, &amp; this course continued till near the end of the year 1585. When the exiled nobles returned, though a new Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was called, the King would not repeale any act, which was made in prejudice of the Church, the yeer before; Yet at length he professed some desires to have the Church settled &amp; called for that conference at <hi>Halirudhouse.</hi> Now what wonder was it, that when all was overturned, &amp; Prelats established by Parl. in their full power, that the Church should take little ere she wanted all, &amp; should condescend to some things, of purpose to get the power of prelats hemmed in, hopeing when this furious tempest was fully blowne over, that she should be in a better capacity to promove her work; And withall it may be seen, that she holdeth as much as she can &amp; mindeth the work of the presbyteries, notwithstanding of the lawes of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> land, as yet unrepealed, standing against her. So that, hence it appeareth, that they never once thought of retracting the act at <hi>Dundee</hi> (as he would make his reader beleeve.). And it would be considered likewise, that at this Assembly there were severall of these Ministers present, who <hi>Anno</hi> 1584. had subscribed unto the prelats: And further it is considerable, That for as great a length as they went: Yet <hi>Sess.</hi> 6. They declared that there were only these Church officers, <hi>Pastors, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, Elders,</hi> &amp; <hi>Deacons;</hi> And that the name <hi>Bishop</hi> should not be taken as in the time of popery, but is a name com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all pastours: and <hi>Sess. 10. &amp;</hi> 11. They declared

that by a <hi>Bishop</hi> they meane only such as the Apostle doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe.</p>

                  </hi> Glasgow, <hi>after the Covenant was taken by the body of the land, could not oblige all the takers of it, to owne their declaration of the sense of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which was not at first imposeing the oath, declared unto them.</hi> To let passe his bitter refl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The like where of would make him &amp; all his fraternity to tremble. <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The Assembly at <hi>Glasgow</hi> did impose no sense of theirs, upon any man, either who took the Covenant before, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; only because to them, as the representative of the Church, the publick &amp; judiciall interpretation of the Covenant or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>aith, did properly belong, they made search after the true sense &amp; meaning of the oath, &amp; did declare &amp; make it appear to all, by undenyable arguments (as hath been showne)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they had found out the true sense &amp; meaning thereof, &amp; what was the sense of the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> when it was first imposed: And was there any wrong here? 2. Such as had renewed that Covenant at that time, &amp; had taken it with the explicatory addition, did swear to forbear the approbation of Church Government by prelats, untill the Generall Assembly should try whether that Government was abjured by the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant or not: And was not that a sufficient impowering of the Assembly, to declare the true sense thereof? But what would this author gather from all thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>? He concludeth that, <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Assembly at</hi> Glasgow <hi>did after the Covenant was taken by the body of the land, could not oblige all the takers thereof, to owne their declaration of the sense of the Covenan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <pb n="412" facs="tcp:65203:223"/>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Though their deed could not oblige the body of the land to owne their sense, yet the Covenant it self did oblige them, &amp; the body of the land did then see themselves obliged, by the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the true sense of the Covenant, which they gave: And what necessity was there for more? The Assembly never of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to give a sense of their own, which had not been heard of before; For that had been intolerable, but according to their place &amp; duty, they, for the good of theland &amp; satisfaction of the Covenanters, search, out of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>hentick records of the Church, what was the sense &amp; meaning of the Church, at that time, when the Covenant was first taken, which every privat person could not be so able to do, &amp; which necessity did require to be done; because of severall doubts which were raised there about.</p>
               <p>He addeth, <hi>&amp; the body of the land hath not indeed abjured E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacy by that nationall Covenant. Neither the Covenant nor ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded interpretation, doth import any such thing. Ans.</hi> This is a strange thing: how can this be seing the body of the people of the land, took that Covenant, by which (when first taken by the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the land) prelacy was abjured? It is true, some who took the Covenant then, being unclear in a matter of fact (which had been done some fifty or sixty yeers before, &amp; in trying &amp; searching out of which, there was some difficulty) whereby one article was unclear to them, at that time, could not think that prelacy was undoubtedly abjured: Yet others did, &amp; those same who at first did doubt, received light by the assemblies declaration, &amp; then saw, that by the Covenant, when first taken by the Church, prelacy was abjured: And that by their taking of the Covenant, according to its true, genuine, native, &amp; first sense now discovered &amp; made plaine (though be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as to this particular, unclear) they had also abjured the same governement of the Church by prelats. 2. How the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant it self importeth the abjuration of prelacy, hath been showne above, &amp; the added interpretation needed not import any such thing.</p>
               <p>Next he sayes <hi>Nor hath the body of the people of the land, by any after deeds, owned that assemblies senseing of the Covenant. Ans.</hi>
                  <pb n="413" facs="tcp:65203:223"/>
Neither was it necessary that they should do so; seing by tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, they did owne it in its true sense, &amp; the Assembly did no more but declare which was its true sense, against which when declared, the body of the land did not protest, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by their silence, did sufficiently declare their owneing of that sense as the only true sense. And further the after Actings of the body of the land, in prosecuteing the ends of that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, did abundantly shew their owneing of that sense, &amp; of none else.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nor</hi> (sayeth he) <hi>was there any Act of that assembly ordaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that all should owne their determination of the sense thereof. Ans.</hi> And that, because there was no necessity for such an Act, their clearing of the true meaning of the oath, &amp; shewing how it could be understood in no other sense, was sufficient. All such as took the Covenant, by a native undenyable consequence, be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>

There is an Act enjoyning all, in time coming (for avoiding any further doubt or disput) to take it according to their deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, in the poynts then debated. And an other Act dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging any to take it, in any other sense. <hi>True</hi> (sayes he) <hi>but few did so &amp; if any did so they are to consider whether they have been too rashly carryed on, in the current of that time, without <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But why was it rashness to take a Covenant, &amp; a lawfull Covenant, in its true sense? Can this be an Act of rashness, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

which was imposed by lawfull authority, both by Church &amp; state; &amp; against which no exceptions of any force can be brought; the whole land standeth obliged against the governement of the Church by prelats: And whether there can be any clear ground or warrand, for abjureing of that Covenant, taken from any deed of the Assembly 1638, seing that assembly did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but cleare up the true sense &amp; meaning of the Covenant, out of the authentick records of the Church, &amp; their sense was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by his Maj. commissioner &amp; by an act of the privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell.

               <p>THus reader, thou hast a clear view of the present state &amp; condition of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> &amp; the true grounds upon which, she is now suffering: Thou seest, how the wayes of <hi>Zion</hi> do mourn, &amp; how the Lord hath covered her with a cloud, in his anger: how he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as if it were of a garden, he hath destroyed his places of the assembly, &amp; caused the solemne feasts &amp; sabbaths to be forgotton in <hi>Zion:</hi> how he hath cast off his altar, abhorred his sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary. &amp; given up into the hand of her enemyes the walls of her palaces; so that she is now made to cry out; is it nothing to you'all yee that passe by, behold &amp; see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow which is done unto me, wherewith the Lord hath afflicted me, in the day of his fierce anger; All who passe by, clap their hands at her, they hisse &amp; wag their head saying is this the city that men call the perfection of beauty, the joy of the whole earth; all her enemies have opened their mouth against her, they hisse &amp; gnash their teeth, they say we have, swallowed her up, certanely this is the day that we looked for, we have found, we have seen it:) And therefore they are consulting to cut her off, that she may; no more be a

nation. But which is worse, The anger of God is gone out against her; he hideth his face, &amp; testifieth his displeasure, against her, &amp; her c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>s; And in so doing just &amp; righteous is he; for she hath rebelled against him. It is the Lord who hath given her to the spoile &amp; to the robbers, even he against whom she hath sinned, for she would not walk in his wayes, neither be obedient unto his law, therefore hath he poured upon her the fury of his anger, &amp; the strength of battell, &amp; it hath set her on fire round about, yet she knew it not, &amp; it burned her, yet she laid it not to heart. Therefore let no man think, whatever apologie any make in her behalf, that she or they do intend to quarrell with the most high, for any of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations towards her; Nay he is just &amp; righteous in all his wayes, yea, though he should punish her yet Seven times more, it would become her to put her mouth in the dust, to be silent, &amp; to bear the indignation of the Lord, because she hath sinned against him, And as yet, she must say, that whatever wrongs her enemies are doing to her, &amp; how ever unjustly she be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering at their hands, yet the righteous God is doing her no wrong, but punishing her lesse then her iniquities do deserve; so that as to his dealing with her, she hath no cause to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine, for it is of the Lord's mercy that she is not consumed, because his compassions faile not.</p>
               <p>And yet it cannot but be expected, that such as have tasted of the cup of affliction themselves, &amp; have resisted unto blood strive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against sin, &amp;c have known by experience what refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hath been in the known sympathy of neighbour Churches, in the day of their tryall &amp; temptation, will minde &amp; make conscience of this Christian duty of sympathy towards the poor Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> now when her enemies are the chief &amp; prosper, &amp; have spread out their hands, upon all her plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant things, when her gates are desolat &amp; her priests sighe. It cannot be thought, that such Churches as owne Christ for their head &amp; husband, can look upon a poor bleeding sister Church which was once decked with ornaments, when her head and King took pleasure in her habitations; but now is striped naked &amp; exposed to shame, &amp; to the scorne &amp; contempt of her ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:65203:226"/>
&amp; not have their eyes affecting their heart. Shall it be thought that there are any of the reformed Churches who <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sau-</hi>like can look on the day of their sister, in the day that she is become a stranger, that can rejoyce over her in the day of her destruction, or speak proudly in the day of her distresse, or look on her affliction in the day of her calamity, or lay hands on her substance in the day of her calamity, or stand in the crosse way to cut off these of hers that escape, or deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver up those of hers that did remaine in the day of distresse? Nay, it is hoped, that as the elect of God, holy &amp; beloved, they have put on bowells of mercies &amp; kindenesse, &amp; have learned to have compassion, &amp; to love as brethren, &amp; to be pitifull, &amp; so cannot forget the afflictions of his people in those Islands, but do bear them on their heart when they have accesse unto the throne of grace, &amp; say, spare thy people o Lord &amp; give not thine heritage to reproach, that the heathen should rule over them, wherefore should they say among the people, where is their God? Seing it is the desire of that poor afflicted Church, that all would cry unto their God &amp; her God, that he would turne from his hote wrath &amp; displeasure, &amp; turne to her with healing under his wings: That he would heale her back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slideings, and love her freely: and that untill he be pleased to turne from the fiercenesse of his anger, his people may be blessed with Christian patience &amp; submission under the mighty hand of God, &amp; helped to hear the voice of the rode, &amp; who hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted it, &amp; to turne unto him who smiteth, that he may binde up &amp; heale that which he hath broken<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>That poor Church will be very far disappoynted of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

she shall meet with unbrotherly &amp; unchristian dealing at the hands of any, &amp; if there shall be any such as will be ready to condemne her, as suffering upon very slender &amp; inconsiderable grounds, as it will be no small matter of grief &amp; sorrow unto the already sorrowfull mourning Church, yea an addition un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her affliction, so it will yeeld these little comfort in the day when the cup shall passe over unto them, to reflect upon their unchristian thoughts, &amp; sharpe censures of a poor mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Christ's body, while lying under the feet of oppressours, &amp; such as said to her soul, bow down that we may goeover. It is true, the infinitly wise God hath thought fit to try that Church with more searching tryalls then he did <hi>England</hi> &amp; <hi>Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> &amp; it was the policy of her adversaries to beginne with such small things, to the end, they might get such as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired, drawne into their net, &amp; then they weresure piece &amp; piece to get them brought alongs, to countenance them in all their courses, as sad experience hath proved; For some, who at the first resolved to goe some length for peace cause, having no purpose to move one foot further, to whom if it had been then said, that, ere all were done, they would go such a length as now they have gone, with <hi>Hazael,</hi> they would have replyed <hi>are we dogs to do such things,</hi> are now going all the length desired, scrupleing at nothing which is a warning to all, to beware of the beginnings of a defection: And indeed for as great as the defection &amp; apostasie in that Church, is at present, &amp; for as great a conspiracy as is found among her prophets; If the tryall had been nothing more searching, then that wherewith the Neigh bour Churches were tryed, there would not have been so many that would have depairted from their former principles, as there are, this day: And therefore it was a mercy unto many in these Neighbour Churches, that their sieve was not more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row &amp; searching: it is no small mercy unto particular persons, when they see their enemies in their owne colours, &amp; the baite is not able to cover the hook, wherewith their adversaries think to catch them: And it is likewise a mercy (&amp; will be so found &amp; acknowledged in end) unto the Church of <hi>Scotl,</hi> that God hath followed such a way with her as shall prove most disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering

But now, let none blame those who have desired to keep their garments clean, &amp; to adhere zealously &amp; constantly unto their former principles, &amp; therefore have refused complyance in the least, &amp; would not willingly quite with a hoof, or sell a bit of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious truth of God: There is a time when such things are very momentous &amp; considerable, which at other times seem not to be of much concernment: Armies may yeeld more unto their enemies at another time &amp; place, then when they are keeping a considerable passe, the loseing of which would prove of great disadvantage unto themselves, &amp; an in-let unto all the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies forces: There is a time when such things must be stood at, which if abstracted from that time &amp; place, would signifie little or nothing, whether done or not done: The giving of a book or of a piece of paper out of the hands of the marty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, was at that time, &amp; as so circumstantiated, a maine busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, when they were upon the poynt of avouching truth for God: A little matter when it becometh <hi>Casus confessionis</hi> is of great moment: <hi>Mordecay's</hi> beck is no small matter: <hi>Daniel's</hi> closeing of his windowes, is a great businesse, as it was then circumstantiated: And doolfull experience, in all ages, hath made it appear what mischief hath followed upon yeelding unto the adversaries in small-like matters, in the begining of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, what through inadvertancy, what otherwayes: by little &amp; little the pope came to his throne, &amp; not in one day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by little &amp; little came prelats formerly to their height, in that Church; &amp; therefore as before, so now the honest party thought themselves called of God, to withstand beginnings &amp; not to cede in the smallest-like matters, when they saw that the opening of never so smal a passage, would be enough to occasion the drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all; as (according to the proverb) the brunt child doth scar the fire, so that Church cannot be blamed for keeping such a distance from that plague of prelacy, which formerly had brunt up &amp; consumed all the vitals of religion, &amp; the whole power of
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:65203:227"/>
Godlinesse, &amp; had made that Church to look like an harlot, &amp; not like the spouse of Christ; Especially after God had wrought such wonderfull deliverances unto her, &amp; had graciously deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered her from that yron furnace, &amp; with his out-stretched arme had brought downe all her enemies, Should they againe break his commandements, &amp; joyn in affinity with the people of those abhominations, would not God be angry with them till he had consumed them, so that there should be no remnant nor escape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? And it is very remarkable, that there are none who have hitherto rued their suffering upon that account, but rather they are all blessing the name of the Lord, for that he hath keeped them from yeelding in the least; And though their adversaries the prelats, be useing barbarous &amp; inhumane, let be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian, wayes, to afflict them still more &amp; more, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureing acts to be made, dischargeing any Charity to be extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to them or their families, who are now suffering for the cause of God; Yet they have no cause to compleane; God, for whose sake they are suffering, is provideing for them, &amp; with all is comforting them with the consolations of the Holy ghost, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting their spirits, keeping them from fainting, &amp; encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageing them, so that they resolve, through his grace, never to comply with these workers of iniquity, lest they partake of their judgments. Yea they are perswaded that if any members of the Christian Churches abroad who had the root of the matter within them, were in their souls stead, they would no more comply with this present course of defection, then they have done, or desire to do; So that, what ever can be looked for from men of corrupt mindes, &amp; such as are enemies to the truth &amp; to the power of godlinesse; Yet they are sure that such as know what it is to walk with God, to have a tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, &amp; to make this their exercise to keep a good conscience both towards God &amp; man, will be loath to condemne them in the least. Yea or if they saw what a deluge of prophanity, is now broken in upon these lands, what unparalleled wickednesse is there perpetrated, what abhomination of all sorts reigneth since this course of defection was begun; Their hearts would tremble, &amp; they would scar at such a course, as is so destructive
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:65203:228"/>
to the Kingdome of God within, &amp; so advantagious for the promoveing of the maine interest of Satan, &amp; never acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that to be a divine truth which is not after Godlinesse. Sure, there is a principle in all the godly which will incline them to affect that course best, which is most for promoveing the work of grace in souls, &amp; abhore that which openeth a gap to all prophanity &amp; licentiousnesse: And though they could disput none against such a course, this were enough to make their gracious souls abhore it. Let none say that such precisenesse, &amp; refuseing to cede in a little will prove destructive to the Church, by incenseing the civil Magistrat the more; For God's way is alwayes the best, both for particular persons &amp; for Churches; &amp; an instance cannot be showne where a Church by her faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full adhereing to the truth of God, standing to her prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, &amp; refuseing to goe back in the least, hath ruined her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; But upon the other hand it hath frequently been seen, how a Church by her yeelding unto the snares of her adversaries, through fear or prudence (falsely so called) hath brought ruine &amp; destruction insensibly upon herself: The yeelding unto a little in the beginning of a defection, hath proven the bane &amp; neck-break of Churches, cedeing to little formes at first, hath brought in the masse, at last.</p>
               <p>But now it is hoped that such as shall duely &amp; Christianly ponder the premisses, shall not account the grounds of the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of that Church &amp; people, punctilioes, or inconsiderable triffles whatever such as do not weigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And where are all those worthies, who set their faces against greater stormes, then any that hath appeared of late? And how is it that so many have out lived their own zeal, &amp; faithfulnesse, &amp; by silence at
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:65203:228"/>
such a time, when God, in his dispensations, did call upon th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And how is it, that this generation hath degenerated, so far as their predecessours might be ignorant of them &amp; not acknowledge them, &amp; have forgotten their former zeal? May not the world wonder at this? But what wonder is it, that it be so, when now their rock hath sold them, &amp; the Lord hath shut them up, when now the Lord hath been displeased and hath made them to drink the wine of astonishment, &amp; for their provocations, hath taken spirit &amp; courage from them, that they may know at length how evill &amp; bitter a thing it is, that they have forsaken the Lord their God?</p>
               <p>And therefore this dispensation of the Lord unto that Church, may &amp; ought to be improved by other protestant neighbour Churches, as a warning from the Lord to repent, &amp; returne unto him; for because of her backslideings hath the Lord brought all this upon her, &amp; he is a jealous God who will spar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Covenanting with the Lord will not hold off judgments, when conscience is not made of these covenants. And now it hath not been <hi>Scotland's</hi> Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with God that hath brought all this upon her: But <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> dealing deceitfully in the Covenant; For so long as she was with some singlenesse of heart, aimeing honestly at the

               <p>Finally, it would become all neighbour reformed Churches to be upon their guaird, for the same Spirit that troubleth that Church now; is the Spirit of <hi>Antichrist</hi> seeking to re-enter there after he hath been cast out, with all his appurtenances, in a most universall &amp; solemne manner, &amp; the door bar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
