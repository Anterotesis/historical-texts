            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>FOR thy better understanding the matters handled in this
treatise, I thought fit to premise somewhat by way of
Preface; and indeed the nature of the thing calleth for

but more particularly in the City of <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> that thou mayest

in it.</p>
            <p>Know then, that after <hi>the Lord</hi> had raised up the <hi>witnesses
of this day,</hi> and had opened in them and unto them <hi>the Light and
Glory</hi> thereof; diverse of them at sundry times were <hi>moved of
the Lord</hi> to come into these parts, &amp; unto the towne of <hi>Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deen,</hi>

of the devill, practising <hi>abominations</hi> under Colour of

denyers</hi> of the true <hi>Christ,</hi> of <hi>Heaven, Hell,

inconsistant with <hi>Magistracy,</hi> nothing better then <hi>John of Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
and his complices, This was the vulgar and familiar lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of the <hi>pulpits</hi> which was for a time received for <hi>unquesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable
truth:</hi> till about the yeare 1663. some sober and <hi>serious
Professors,</hi> in and about the said Towne, did begin to weigh these
things more narrowly, and find the savour of that life in the <hi>te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony</hi>
of that so much reproached <hi>people</hi> which some yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
had stirred in others, who were now come to a great <hi>losse</hi> and
<hi>decay,</hi> and this gave them occasion to examine the Principles and
wayes of that <hi>People</hi> more exactly, which proving upon inquiry,
to be far otherwayes, then they had been represented, gave them a
further occasion to see the <hi>integrity</hi> and soundnesse of that <hi>despised
People</hi> and of their <hi>Principles,</hi> on the one hand; and on the
other, to see the <hi>prejudic'd disingenuity</hi> and <hi>enmity</hi> of their
accusers. In these the <hi>Lord</hi> caused his <hi>word</hi> to prosper, (who
were few in number, yet noted as to their sobriety in their former way
of <hi>profession</hi>) and raised them up to own that <hi>People</hi> and their
<hi>testimony,</hi> and to become <hi>one</hi> with them: now their <hi>adversarys</hi>
finding nothing in these whom the Lord had raised, up in these parts
whereof to accuse them, as to their <hi>conversation,</hi> these <hi>Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi>
must bee cast upon <hi>strangers</hi> living some hundred miles distant,
where these <hi>untruths</hi> cannot be so easily disproved; but as to these at
home the tune must be turned: therefor <hi>George Meldrum</hi> who
hath more particulary espoused the quarrel against <hi>truth</hi> and its
<hi>followers,</hi> then any of his Brethren, begins to say that it is no
wonder to see Quakers forbeare grosse outbreakings, for that <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi>
have formerly come as great a length (but surely abstinence
from grosse outbreakings and a cleane outward conversation is no
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64468:3"/>
good Argument against the Quakers,) so now the clamour is,
though they have been <hi>Professors</hi> and that <hi>noted ones</hi> too, and
though they be honest in <hi>their conversation,</hi> yet they are <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded</hi>
and <hi>deceived,</hi> and are <hi>deceivers.</hi> And thus as of old,
the truth and the witnesses of it have alwayes been reproached by
those of the <hi>Pharisaical Spirit.</hi> So now; for sometimes they said
<hi>Christ</hi> had a <hi>Devill,</hi> sometimes the <hi>Apostles</hi> are drunck, and
other times mad. Since these things have thus occurred, there
hath been no little industry used, to suppresse this <hi>People,</hi> by
<hi>threatnings</hi> and <hi>persecution,</hi> (on which account divers of
our Friends have been cast into Prison, and some detained long in,
of the said towne,) and also by preaching and writing, of which
for thy information receive this account. There were 30. <hi>Queries</hi>
sent by the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Aberdeen</hi> (so called) to <hi>Alexander
Jaffray.</hi> Also about the same time, a paper of 3. or 4. sheets
subscribed by <hi>G. M.</hi> intituled, <hi>The state of the controversy
betwixt the Protestants and the Quakers:</hi> The 30 <hi>Querys</hi>
were, not long after, answered by <hi>G. K.</hi> in respect of <hi>A. J.</hi> his sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
at that time, and returned to him from <hi>A. J.</hi> and sometime
afterwards, <hi>George Meldrum</hi> his paper called, <hi>The state of
the controversy, &amp;c.</hi> was answered by <hi>G. K.</hi> to which papers
of <hi>G. K.</hi> somewhat was premised by <hi>A. J.</hi> which papers being
severall times called for, (but particularly in a letter, from
<hi>G. M.</hi> his own hand to <hi>A. J.</hi> wherein he intreats for an <hi>answer</hi>
that hee might know, as hee said, in what things wee did differ, or
in what things wee onely seemed to differ) were sent to him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
9. monthes after the receit of <hi>G. M.</hi> his papers Before all
which a sermon on Purpose was preached by <hi>G. M.</hi> against the
<hi>quakers</hi> in the ninth month 1666. wherein the summe of both
his papers was asserted, onely that it was digested in a <hi>Pulpit-way</hi>
and introduced with an insinuating <hi>discourse</hi> of his pretended
kindnesse for the persons of some <hi>Quakers,</hi> and his unwillingnesse
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64468:4"/>
to medle with them, were it not his <hi>office,</hi> and <hi>zeale</hi> for the <hi>truth</hi>
did ingage him to it, but if it had been so indeed, hee would have
said no more of them then the truth, whereas it is stuffed with lyes;
which are positively asserted to be the <hi>Quakers principles,</hi> by this
pretended Preacher of the <hi>Gospel</hi> from his <hi>chaire</hi> of verity, (so
called,) or rather of <hi>falsehood:</hi> whereas yet <hi>G. M.</hi> his <hi>Papers</hi>
afore-mentioned, were not so much as sent, far lesse answered,

he received this understanding, whilst he was ignorant of the
differences according to his <hi>owne Confession,</hi> he is not ashamed to
forge numbers of lyes, upon the Lords People: and as if they had been
<hi>truths,</hi> consisting in his <hi>knowledge,</hi> to vent them before a

to that <hi>innocent</hi> and <hi>pure principle,</hi> the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Christ Jesus</hi>
in thee, which beares <hi>testimony</hi> against all evil; that thereby
tbou mayest try, and examine what is here writ, and who are the
owners of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and who are the <hi>wresters</hi> of it, which thou
canst only, truly discover and discerne, by the <hi>Spirit</hi> from which the
<hi>Scriptures</hi> came, even that inward <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi>

AUTHOR.</head>
            <p>HAving taken a serious <hi>view</hi> of the <hi>Dialogue</hi> lately publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by thee, and having weighed and considered it, in
the fear of the <hi>Lord,</hi> I found it incumbent upon the, to
reply unto it, both upon the account of <hi>Truth,</hi> at which
it strikes, and for thy <hi>Soules sake,</hi> as also for others, that any <hi>simple
hearts,</hi> who have received hurt by it, may be undeceived, and thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faire
dealing may be manifested, in order whereunto, before I enter
upon the <hi>examination</hi> thereof particularly, I have some things to lay
before thee.</p>
            <p>And <hi>first,</hi> as to the manner and method of thy book by way of <hi>Dialo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue,</hi>
it is no wayes allovvable from thee, being but a meer shift, to

               </gap> large.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> the nature of this kind of wro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

to set dovvne, as largely, what could be said on the one hand, as on
the other, and to have brought in all the <hi>proofs,</hi> and arguments, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
by the <hi>Quakers,</hi> or at least the most considerable, but in that
thou hast done nothing so much as becoms <hi>a man</hi> far lesse <hi>a Christian,</hi>
as any who have converse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> principles,</hi> and

               </gap>t thy self occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

               </gap>nes of thy <hi>Cause,</hi> and thy <hi>weaknes</hi> in pleasing for it, is
that the <hi>substance</hi> of what thou hast said is nothing else, but that
which was writ, in the <hi>papers</hi> before mentioned, and so largely
answered already: Whereof thou art altogether <hi>silent</hi> and wouldst in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sinuate,
that what thou hast here writ, was never answered by any
<hi>Quaker,</hi> yea is unanswerable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly.</hi> In the beginning of thy <hi>Epistle,</hi> thou alledgest that thou
hast examined divers <hi>Opinions</hi> (of the people called <hi>Quakers</hi>) and after

               </gap>yall, found them to be <hi>naught,</hi> where as thou hast not so much as
mentioned, far lesse answered, the <hi>Arguments</hi> used by them, and in
the manner of signifying their <hi>principles,</hi> thou givest not their own
words, but couchest them, in such words of thy own framing as
may bear the most disadvantagious construction; hence thou sayst,
that they deny <hi>original sin,</hi> that they overturn the doctrine of the <hi>Saints
perseverance,</hi> that they call the <hi>ordinances</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> the inventions of
men, all which things as so conceived, are false.</p>
            <p>4. There hath appeared in thee, ane airy <hi>spirit,</hi> full of vanity
and selfe conceit, a thing which thou seemest much to cry out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>in others,</hi> and wil not see it in <hi>thy selfe,</hi> hence in thy <hi>Epistle,</hi>
thou boastest, that thou hast so succinctly confuted their errors,
highly commending the manner of thy writing, as that, which,
for ought thow knowest, was never done by any, who never hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
these things with greater plaines and <hi>condescendingnes</hi> to the
meanest <hi>capacity,</hi> and in so narrow a compasse, as thy owne words
bear. The signifying that it was the judgement of some, that the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing
of thy papers might tend to <hi>edification;</hi> the crying up of thy
<hi>Zeale,</hi> for the <hi>ordinances,</hi> and many other passages, too tedious to
relate doe very much evidence, an itching desire in thee to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
and applauded in thy enterprise.</p>
            <p>5. In the writing and framing of thy <hi>discourse</hi> thou hast introduced
thy selfe, most <hi>child<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

pages in thy book, as they are heerafter examined.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now more particularly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So soone as thou enterest upon the matter of debate Pag. 2. thou
beginnest with great <hi>disingenuity:</hi> an evidence of what may be expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
or will be found throughout the rest. For notwithstanding the
words of the <hi>Quaker.</hi> are of thy owne framing, and that they lye pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
before thee, yet thou hast not had so much honesty, in thy
answer as to subsume them aright. The <hi>Quaker</hi> sayes, I use not flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64468:6"/>
titles, and give thee not heathenish salutations and bowings,
least I should sin and be found an Idolater: in answer to which
thou beginnest with a false subsumption, saying thou wonderest
that he should call <hi>salutations</hi> and <hi>bowings</hi> heathenish, and Idolatrous.
Indeed it is no strange thing, that thou and others misrepresent us,
and belye us in repeating our <hi>words</hi> at a distance, when in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of writing thou canst not truly repeat, those words, which thou
placest for ours, when they be just written before thee. Is it not
one thing to say, that <hi>Salutations</hi> that are heathenish or heathenish
<hi>salutations,</hi> cannot be used without sin, and <hi>idolatrie,</hi> and another
thing to say, that <hi>salutations</hi> and <hi>bowings</hi> are heathenish, and i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous?
Who is so blind as not to see here a vast diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.
As to the first, who dares deny it to be a truth, that
vvill offer to call himselfe a Christian? to vvit, that <hi>salutations,</hi> and
bovvings, that are heathenish, cannot be used vvithout <hi>idolatrie</hi> and
sin? But as to the other that <hi>Salutations</hi> and bovvings are heathenish
and <hi>idolatrous,</hi> being taken in <hi>generall,</hi> vvas never said, nor judged
by the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and therefore to charge them vvith it, is utterly false,
and a lye, for such <hi>salutations</hi> as <hi>Christ</hi> commands, and the <hi>Apostles</hi>
practised, the <hi>Quakers</hi> dearly ovvne, and frequently use, and find
in them great refreshment becaus there through the <hi>life</hi> flovves, and
is communicated from one <hi>vessell</hi> to another, but such <hi>salutations,</hi>
thou art ignorant of, and of <hi>the life</hi> that is there through communicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
vvhich bears <hi>testimonie</hi> against all that is heathenish and <hi>idolatrous,</hi>
and leads out of it, and therefore in thy <hi>dark mind,</hi> vvouldst from
thence, plead for the customary <hi>salutations</hi> of the heathen, as appears
by the proofs thou bringest vvherein thy folly is very much mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested.
<hi>Christ,</hi> sayest thou, commanded his disciples, vvhen they
entred into a house to salute it, hee did so, <hi>and what more?</hi> And
if the house be vvorthy, their <hi>peace</hi> shall be upon it, to vvit, the
peace through the salutation intimated or offered, becaus they
brought to that house, the tender of the <hi>Gospell</hi> and glad tydings,
vvhich vvas a good <hi>salutation,</hi> but vvhat vvouldst thou inferr from
that? that vve ought to doe of our <hi>hats</hi> one to another, a thing
vvhich they never did, by vvhose example thou vvouldst presse us to
doe it, and it is knowne, that it is a thing unusuall in that part of the
world to this day. That other proof, alledged from <hi>Paul,</hi> saluting the
<hi>Churches</hi> makes as litle if not far lesse to the purpose, <hi>Paul</hi> in his <hi>Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:64468:6"/>
who was at a great distance, vvisheth grace and peace to the
<hi>Churches</hi> from <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Lord Iesus Christ;</hi> Ergo wee
ought to take of our hats. Can there be any thing more ridiculous? is
this the great esteeme yee put upon the <hi>scriptures</hi> to take the <hi>salutations</hi>
of the blessed <hi>Apostle Paul</hi> signified by the motions of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi>
vvhich vvas the very blessing of <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Churches</hi> or rather of the
<hi>Spirit</hi> through him, for to prove your doing off hats, one of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
customs of this vvorld. Is not this to make a mock of the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turs,</hi>
and a stretching them to plead for that, against vvhich is the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
tendencie of their testimonie. Next thou givest us <hi>Abrahams</hi> prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise;
but every practise of <hi>Abraham</hi> is not a <hi>rule</hi> to us, nor to you either;
the like may be said of that of <hi>Moses.</hi> Though <hi>Moses</hi> did obeisance to
his father in law that makes nothing against us, far lesse his kissing of
him, and asking him of his vvelfare, both vvhich things the <hi>Quakers</hi>
deny not. Thou acknovv ledgest that religious vvorship given to the
<hi>Creature</hi> is <hi>idolatrie.</hi> What is <hi>Religious</hi> Worship but that vvhich is given
to <hi>God?</hi> and is not the bovving of the body, and uncovering of the
head, the signification of your Worship to <hi>God?</hi> And if yee give the
same to the <hi>Creature</hi> also, where is the difference? for in the external
signification it is not distinguished, unles it be said to be, the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which if it be, wee shall have the Papists pleading the same, for
their adoration of <hi>images,</hi> and the <hi>relicts</hi> of the saints. And truly your
being found in these things gives them advantage in that matter. That
<hi>courtesie</hi> and <hi>Christianity</hi> are not repugnant, vvee deny not, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
for <hi>Christians</hi> to be <hi>Courteous</hi> one to another is very fit, vvhich in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
that the <hi>Apostle</hi> commands wee acknowledge: But that <hi>Courtesie</hi>
consists in taking off hats, and bovving to one another, that rests for
thee to prove. In the next place, to prove the indifference of using the
<hi>plurall number</hi> instead of the <hi>singular</hi> to one person, thou sayest, thou
art very confident, the <hi>Kingdome of God</hi> consists not in vvords so am I
too, yet I strange, thou shouldst say so, considering thy <hi>principles,</hi>
for vvhat is all your preaching but <hi>words,</hi> yea vvhat is the <hi>Scripture</hi>
it selfe, (I meane that vvhich yee have of it, to vvit the letter)
but <hi>words?</hi> And seing the very <hi>Gospell</hi> according to you, is but a
company of <hi>words</hi> being a declaration of vvhat past, many hundred
years agoe, hovv has thy zeale here to oppose the <hi>Quakers</hi> made thee
forget thy selfe in this matter? Thou sayest, that to vvhich the <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:64468:7"/>
number is agreeable, the <hi>plurall</hi> may be applyed to without
making a lye. The proofs alleged for that be <hi>Matth. 23. 37. Luk.</hi>
22. 31. 3 <hi>Epistle</hi> of <hi>Iohn,</hi> vers. 13, evince nothing in this matter, for
the Contexts being rightly considered vvill clearly make out, that
the vvords are not applyed to one single person only, exclusively of
others, and that of <hi>Luke</hi> is to a flock comprehending the disciples,
to vvhom hee vvas speaking just before, but there is no confounding
of the number, vvhere one <hi>single</hi> person is only spoken to, and that
vvithout understanding of any more. And though indeed it vvere
good, that the difference vvere not greater, yet the differences in
these things evidence that there be differences in greater matters.
And in respect that yee are estranged from the <hi>principle</hi> that leads out
of <hi>corruption</hi> in all things, therefor yee cannot see the vveight, that
is in these things vvhich is more then yee are avvare of.</p>
            <p>Pag. 3. Thou seem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t to take great advantage of these words.
Heretofore I walked according to my light, and the same I doe
still, and while in the integritie of my heart, I walked in the way,
thou art now in, I dare not say, but <hi>God,</hi> countenanced me in it.
Here thou makest a great stirr as if thou hadst brought the <hi>Quaker</hi> to
a great <hi>Dilemma.</hi> But to passe by thy examining of the weak <hi>objection,</hi>
which thou makest in the <hi>Quakers</hi> behalfe which I beleive was never
alledged by any of them unto thee, as that wherwith they either only
or cheifly defend themseves in this matter. To wit <hi>Salomons</hi> sacrificing
at <hi>gibion.</hi> As in many other particulars so in this thou statest the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi>
part, but too weakely, and faintly, yea disingenuously, for <hi>the
light,</hi> which wee walk according unto and desire to walk according
to it for ever, is <hi>the light of Christ in us,</hi> and not our <hi>light</hi> otherwise then
by the free gift of <hi>God</hi> which wee doe freely acknowledge did shine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <hi>in our hearts</hi> in some measure in the tyme, wee walked with you
(though wee did not so know it) and gave us some <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning</hi>
of things, and begot a measure of integrity and honesty of
heart towards <hi>the Lord</hi> in divers of us, and turned the <hi>bent</hi> of our
hearts truly towards him in measure. And <hi>the Lord</hi> countenanced and
visited and sometims refreshed us <hi>secretly</hi> in these dayes, with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to that measure of integrity he found <hi>in us,</hi> and not becaus <hi>of,</hi>
or in respect unto that way of <hi>Profession</hi> wee then walked in, which
way was truly a hurt unto us and not advantage, and it was not <hi>your
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64468:7"/>
way,</hi> which wee walked in with you, that the <hi>Lord</hi> countenanced
but the <hi>integrity</hi> and <hi>uprightnes,</hi> which hee had begot in us, and
had placed in us, as a tender plant and as a root in dry ground, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the oppression of your way, which burdened it, and untill wee
were brought out of your way, by his <hi>arme</hi> which drew us, his
<hi>seed</hi> and <hi>plant in us</hi> suffered, and was oppressed as a <hi>cart</hi> with sheafes,
but after wee were delivered from yout <hi>way,</hi> and turned to <hi>the way</hi>
wee now walk <hi>in,</hi> the <hi>seed</hi> and <hi>plant,</hi> which suffered came to receive
<hi>strength,</hi> and be raised unto <hi>life</hi> and <hi>Dominion,</hi> as many <hi>are witnesses</hi> at
this day. Nor is this thy argument, any other, but that which
which the <hi>papists</hi> did throw against those who sometymes walked with
them in the <hi>popish</hi> vvay of profession some hundred years agoe vvhen
they came out from among them, vvhom the <hi>Lord</hi> visited, vvhile
they vvere among them, and at tymes refreshed them; till he
brought them forth to vvitnes against them; for the <hi>Lord</hi> hath a
people in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and hath his sheep, vvhich are scattered on the dry
and barren mountains of many <hi>sorts,</hi> and <hi>wayes</hi> of <hi>professions,</hi> vvho
have some tender breathings, and desires after him, and vvith a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to his <hi>breathing seed</hi> in them, hee visits them, and refresheth
them at tymes, vvhich yet proves not that they should remaine,
vvhere they are in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and upon the dry <hi>mountains</hi> of dead <hi>professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
and observations. For the <hi>Call</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> is unto them to come out
of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and his arme is stretched forth, to gather them, off from
all these hills, unto his owne <hi>holy hill, Mount Zion,</hi> that they may
feed and lye downe with them, who were as sheep going astray, but
are now returned unto the <hi>shepherd</hi> &amp; <hi>bishop</hi> of their soules. Also may
not those of the <hi>Episcopall</hi> forme object the same, against those who
have left it, upon a further discovery, and yet its like thou will not
deny, but some who have beene under the <hi>episcopall</hi> forme, had a
measure of integrity to <hi>God,</hi> while under it, and with a regard to
that the <hi>Lord</hi> at tym's refreshed them; <hi>God</hi> does not frequently discover
his will to his Children, all at once, nor lead them throughly out of
things, out of which, they are to come, <hi>in an instant,</hi> and yet
that hee countananceth them in there travel cannot, be denied, did not
the <hi>Lord</hi> countenance <hi>Cornelius,</hi> before <hi>Peter</hi> came unto him? As
appears by <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 4. And yet this was no argument, that <hi>Cornelius,</hi>
should not owne the <hi>Apostles and Christians,</hi> and did not the <hi>Lord</hi> counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64468:8"/>
the disciples, though even, when they wer following him,
they were ignorant of many things, and in some things wrong,
and whither did not the Lord countenance <hi>Luther</hi> in his testimony a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Pope,</hi> as well in the <hi>first,</hi> as in the <hi>last</hi> steps of it, although
it appears: that when hee first began to preach, against <hi>indulgences,</hi>
hee intended, not such a thing as afterwadrs followed, but things
opened more and more unto him, till they came unto that <hi>period,</hi>
they were brought unto, befor his <hi>death;</hi> and who of you will say,
that God did not countenance him from the beginning whilest he held
many things, which hee himselfe came to see to be wrong, and
erred very grossly in the matter of <hi>Consubstantiation.</hi> The like may be
said of <hi>Iohn Husse</hi> and others, whom you acknovvledge to have beene
<hi>Martyrs:</hi> at last thou endest it, vvith a <hi>question,</hi> asking vvhither it
be safe, to leane to the <hi>audience</hi> of that <hi>light,</hi> vvhich one vvhile
sayeth that such a vvay is the vvay of <hi>Christ,</hi> and another vvhile thou
must come out of it, for it is the vvay of <hi>Antichrist:</hi> To vvhich,
vvhat is above mentioned, ansvvers sufficiently, yet further I may
easily retort the <hi>Question</hi> thus, upon the most of all the <hi>nationall Minis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi>
in Scotland, vvho are novv licking up, that vvhich they hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
cryed out against as Antichristian and vvith fire and svvord per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
those vvho offered to plead for that vvhich novv they both
practise, and avovv themselfs in. Novv as the fault of this cannot be
ascribed to the <hi>scripturs,</hi> which is the rule, whereby they pretend
to be guided so neither can any mans instability that pretends to be
guided by the light (if any such thing could be showne) prove the
<hi>light</hi> a <hi>guide</hi> not to be followed.</p>
            <p>To prove that <hi>Christ</hi> is not <hi>in</hi> all men, thou arguest thus. <hi>Christ</hi>
is not <hi>in</hi> all men, becaus the Scripture speaks of a being without <hi>Christ</hi>
in the world, to which thou addest the <hi>Reason,</hi> the unconverted must
needs be without <hi>Christ,</hi> becaus they want the <hi>uniting principle,</hi> vvhich
is <hi>faith;</hi> to ansvver, that <hi>Christ</hi> is <hi>in</hi> them, but not in <hi>union</hi> vvith
them, thou sayest is a fond <hi>distinction</hi> becaus the <hi>Scripturs</hi> vvay of
expressing peoples <hi>union</hi> vvith <hi>Christ,</hi> is by asserting <hi>Christ</hi> to be in
them, vvhich thou takest for granted, and from thence dravvest thy
<hi>conclusion,</hi> but if it be found to be false, then the vvhole <hi>fabrick</hi>
Falls, to the ground (as indeed fals it is): For even according
to the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> the <hi>in being</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> in men sometimes signifies
<hi>union,</hi> and sometimes his <hi>existence</hi> in them vvorking and operating
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64468:8"/>

               </gap>fe, and <hi>judgment,</hi> as also by vvay of call and
<hi>invitation,</hi> to prepare for <hi>union</hi> vvith him. As appears by the very
first <hi>Scripture</hi> cited by thee, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 15. 4. 5. vvhich ansvvers not thy
mind. For vvee say not, that vvhere there is no <hi>union,</hi> fruit can be
brought forth unto <hi>God,</hi> but mark the last part of it, hovv much it
makes against thee, vvithout me sayes <hi>Christ,</hi> yee can doe nothing.
For how becoms an unconverted man a convert, but by having <hi>Christ</hi>
to vvork vvith him? &amp; vvhere does <hi>Christ</hi> cooperate? Does hee not
there vvhere the vvork of <hi>Conversion</hi> is wrought; and is not that
<hi>within?</hi> So that <hi>Christ</hi> must needs be <hi>in men,</hi> before they be in
<hi>union</hi> with him, whereby the faith may be wrought, by which
they are united to him and as to that other Scripture, 1. John. 3.
24. these and other Scriptures which might be cited hold forth that
<hi>in being</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> which is by union, but say nothing, against his
<hi>in being</hi> in them, where the <hi>union</hi> is not, for he is <hi>in them</hi> who

            <p>Pag. 7. <hi>Thou sayest all men have not saving and sufficient light in them,
becaus the Scripture saith that some men are brutish in their knowledge, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>erem.</hi>
10. 19. <hi>But why didst not thou cite these words, For the pastors are become
brutish, and have not sought the Lord, therfor they shall not prosper.</hi> Wee
see the proofe of this, at this day, but from thence, how makest
thou it appear, that some men want <hi>Saving light:</hi> the <hi>pastors</hi> are now as
<hi>brutish,</hi> as they wer then, and it is becaus they turne their backs upon
that <hi>light,</hi> and will not follow it: therfor wee have the more need to
bear <hi>testimony</hi> unto it, and against their brutishnes, who reject and
despise it. Next thou citest <hi>Rom. 3. 11. There is none that understandeth.</hi>
But, will that inferre that there is not any <hi>saving light</hi> in them? Why
understand they not, but becaus they are not turned to the <hi>light</hi> that can
give them understanding? <hi>It is supposed sayest thou, that the light in some
may be darknes.</hi> So it may indeed, to wit, that <hi>light,</hi> that is gathered,
from the carnal and earthly wisdome, which is from below, where it
takes the <hi>letter</hi> of the <hi>Scripturs,</hi> and ads thereunto its <hi>commentaries
and consequences,</hi> setting up this in them, as their only <hi>light,</hi> wee
find that <hi>light</hi> proves but <hi>darknes;</hi> but that will not inferre that the
true <hi>light,</hi> which coms from <hi>Christ,</hi> is or can be <hi>darknes</hi> unles in
that sence, as the day of the Lord is called darknes, in Scripture,
for even the true light, unto them, who reject it, is as <hi>darknes,</hi> in
that it gives them not that <hi>comfort</hi> and <hi>joy,</hi> which it giveth unto them,
who <hi>love it,</hi> and <hi>owne</hi> it, but troubleth and affrighteth them, as the
<hi>night,</hi> and the <hi>darknes.</hi> So that these <hi>Scriptures</hi> stand in good <hi>unity</hi> with
the Principle of all mens having <hi>saving light</hi> in them. Next thou objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
<hi>that having of sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ing light, and grace presupposes Conversion;</hi> But that
I deny, for on the contrary, <hi>Conversion</hi> presupposeth <hi>having light and
grace,</hi> by which and to which men are to be <hi>converted,</hi> So that before
a man be converted hee must have <hi>Saving grace</hi> in order to convert
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64468:10"/>
him, even as, the being healed of a wound, presupposeth the plaister,
or salve, but not on the contrary, for, the application of the plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
presupposeth not, the being healed. But whereas, thou sayest,
what need is there of his turning, when men are in this <hi>state</hi> already?
thou misrepresentest us, for wee doe not say, that all men are in a
state of <hi>light</hi> and <hi>grace;</hi> to be in a state of grace, is to stand in <hi>grace,</hi>
which the wicked doe not stand in, yet this hinders not, but that
<hi>grace</hi> is communicated unto them, whereby they may come to a <hi>state,</hi>
or standing in it, while the day of their <hi>visitation</hi> remains.</p>
            <p>Againe thou undertakest to prove, <hi>that all men have not sufficient light,
two wayes;</hi> first, <hi>that all men, have not the Spirit of God.</hi> jud. 19. to
which I <hi>answer,</hi> that there may be a sufficient <hi>light</hi> in men, who may
be said after a certaine manner, not to have the <hi>Spirit,</hi> as being such,
vvho, though the Spirit be in them, to invite, call, and dravv them
unto <hi>God,</hi> yet resist his dravvings, and so separate themselves from
it, so continuing untill the day of <hi>Gods visitation</hi> unto them, come
to an end, concerning vvhom it is true, that then, they have
not the <hi>Spirit</hi> so much as to invite and call them, unto <hi>God,</hi> or to
give unto them, the least tender of his <hi>love.</hi> And though all have not
the spirit bringing forth the fruits thereof in them, to vvit <hi>love, mecknes,
gentlenes, &amp;c.</hi> as no vvicked persons have, yet all, even the vvicked
in a certaine day, have the <hi>Spirit</hi> in them, to reprove and convince,
yea to call upon them: and strive vvith them, in order unto their
<hi>Conversion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> for the <hi>Spirit of God reproves the world of sin.</hi> John. 19. 8. and
<hi>Acts. 7. 50. Yee stiffe necked and uncircumcised, yee doe alwayes resist the holy
Ghost, and</hi> Gen. 6. <hi>My spirit, shall not always strive</hi> vvith (or in) man
and many more to that purpose.</p>
            <p>For a <hi>Second</hi> reason of its insufficiency, thou sayest, <hi>it reveales not Iesus
Christ a saviour, in respect, it gives not a discoverie, of his incarnation,
passion, resurrection,</hi> &amp;c. Citing, 1. Cor. 2. 2. and from this
place, thou wouldst inferr, that the Apostle <hi>preferred the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Christ, as crucified outwardly, to all other knowledge. Answer.</hi>
Though wee willingly acknowledge, that to know him, even as
he did outwardly come, and was crucified, &amp;c. Is a <hi>Good knowledge,</hi>
and of great profit, and comfort to them, who believe, yet wee
deny, that the knowledge of him, as <hi>outwardly crucified,</hi> is the
best, of all other knowledge, of him, or to be preferred to all
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64468:10"/>
other wayes of knowing him, nor does that Scripture. 1. Cor. 2. 2
prove it. For <hi>Paul,</hi> is not speaking there, of <hi>Christ,</hi> as crucified
<hi>outwardly in Iudea,</hi> but of him, as hee was <hi>inwardly</hi> crucified <hi>in the
Corinthians,</hi> when <hi>Paul</hi> first came unto them, to preach the <hi>Gospell,</hi>

               <hi>That there is no other name under heaven, wherby any can be saved but

vvee knovv the <hi>inward</hi> is the maine thing, and vvher it is enjoyed,

true faith is not a blind faith.</hi> Answer. It is granted, but this blood is
knovvne and felt within, to wash and purge the conscience, for <hi>Christ</hi>
as hee is <hi>within,</hi> is not without his <hi>blood,</hi> which is spirituall, even the
pure blood of the <hi>vine,</hi> and is that wine of the kingdome which is
<hi>inwardly</hi> felt to wash, and to refresh, which hee givs to them, who
know not distinctly the outward sheding of the blood, as it was
many hundred years agoe, and which many are ignorant of who
have heard much of the outward shedding of his blood, but know
not the blood, as shed and poured forth <hi>in them</hi> to sprinkle their
consciences from dead works, for it is a <hi>mistery</hi> sealed up from all
who stand in opposition to his <hi>light within.</hi> But there, marke thy
owne words, <hi>The plaister must be applyed, ere the sore can de healed.</hi>
Must not then saving grace be applyed ere, the soul be converted,
or healed? Contrary to thy other assertion, Pag. 7. <hi>that having of
saving light and grace presupposeth conversion, that is healing.</hi>

            <p>As for thy deceitful insinuation, to render us odious, <hi>That if our
principles were generally owned the nations in one age, or two, would be
overspread with as palpable darknes, as the heathen nations at this day are.</hi>
Seeing it has no just ground, wee returne it upon thee, as false and
malicious: for It is the owning the <hi>light</hi> &amp; other <hi>principles</hi> held by us,
therein, which will make these nations, and all others who owne
it, and them, to overflow with the true and saving knowledge of
<hi>God</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi> but so long as they follow such blind guides as thy
selfe, who oppose the <hi>light,</hi> darknes will cover them, as at this
day, notwithstanding all their professions, and confessions of him,
while in works they deny him, and remaine estranged from his <hi>light</hi>
in them. The reason, thou addest is blind and unreasonable, <hi>For accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to you</hi> (thou sayest) <hi>the light within us, is a sufficient teacher, take

which who doe, it will lead them to read and make use of the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
and will lead them to the assemblies of <hi>Gods</hi> people, and to
heare and receive the ministrie of those, whom God sends, yea to
love and esteem them greatly, for their works sake, and it will
lead them to owne <hi>Christ,</hi> and the benefits of his <hi>death,</hi> and
<hi>sufferings</hi> in the outward, and give them an understanding, how
to conceive, and use a right those things, as opportunity is given them.</p>

               <hi>Pag.</hi> 10. Thou sayst, <hi>Christ is a light, who communicateth light to
all men, but where find you, that the light communicated to all men is
Christ himselfe? wee must not confound the light giver, with the Light or
enlightening given.</hi> Answ. Wee doe not confound them, but wee
must not divide, or separate them, as thou and you doe, for where
the <hi>light</hi> or <hi>enlightening</hi> from <hi>Christ</hi> is, there is <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe; hee is
not separated from it, but is in <hi>it,</hi> and with it: wee must not be so
grosse, as to conceive that <hi>Christ</hi> enlightens men, in such a way of
outward distance, as the body of the Sun, being so many thousand
miles above the clouds, <hi>enlightens</hi> our naturall eyes, but comes not
neare us otherwise then by its influence, and rayes; for Christ
is near unto every one, no lesse then his influence, for in him
wee live and move and have our being. And this nearenes of
his unto <hi>all men,</hi> in a day, is more then that generall presence, in
respect vvhereof, hee abides, vvith <hi>all the works of his hands,</hi> for as
much as hee is in them to enlighten them, that they may beleive
Joh. 1. 9. compared vvith 7. Verse. <hi>Pag.</hi> 11. Here because thou
canst not deny, but <hi>that there is light in all men, thou sayest it is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
called the light of nature, and that some remainders of knowledge, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of good remaine in man, after the ruins of Gods Image in him, as when
a city is demolished, some foundation of houses doe still romaine.</hi> But
how is this consistent, with what you say, to wit, that there is no
good thing at all <hi>in men</hi> unconverted, and that man fell wholly from
<hi>God,</hi> and that <hi>Adams</hi> fall was not <hi>in part</hi> but wholly, as to <hi>all things,</hi>
that are good? And that wee derive nothing from him, but that,
which is corrupted, and defiled? But the <hi>Scriptures</hi> testimony is
plaine, that since <hi>the fall, the free gift</hi> or <hi>grace</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> is come upon
all, unto <hi>justification of life.</hi> It is not said, justification is come
upon all: but the free gift or grace of God, is come upon all
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64468:12"/>
unto justification, so that all may be justified, if they did close
with it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 8. And <hi>God so loved the VVorld, Iohn. 3. 16. And this
is the condemnation of the VVorld, that Light is come into it,</hi> Vers. 19.
Which is after the fall. And what ever any may conceive that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
<hi>in man</hi> of the <hi>Image of God</hi> after the <hi>fall,</hi> that could not have
any povver to convince man of evil, or enable him to doe any thing
that is good, if it were not visited and influenced a new from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> but it would remaine as a thing without all
<hi>Life</hi> and <hi>vertue,</hi> as a candle extinguished. For by the <hi>fall, the lamb,</hi>
the witnes came to be slaine and remained so, until the <hi>Spirit of life</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
was sent from <hi>God</hi> into it, to give it <hi>life</hi> and <hi>power,</hi> to witnes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

for salvation.</p>
            <p>Now as to the word <hi>Nature,</hi> if it be rightly understood there shall
be no great difference about it. For if by <hi>Nature</hi> thou understandest
the <hi>Nature</hi> that is corrupt and fallen, and that which simply is derived
from <hi>Adam,</hi> then wee deny, that, that <hi>Nature</hi> can claime any right to
this <hi>Light,</hi> or that it can be said to proceed, from that <hi>Nature.</hi> But if
thou understandest by nature, the nature, that is spiritual and
heavenly, and is derived from <hi>Christ,</hi> the second <hi>Adam,</hi> the
quickning Spirit, the Lord from Heaven, then I say the <hi>Light</hi> may
properly be called the <hi>Light</hi> of that <hi>Nature,</hi> in which sense, is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
that place of the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. v. 14. cited by thee,
where hee sayeth, <hi>The Gentiles which have not the Law did by nature the
things contained in the Law.</hi> For who will be so grosse, as to say that
the <hi>Gentiles</hi> by the corrupt <hi>Nature</hi> could doe the things contained in
the <hi>Law,</hi> which is <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>Holy?</hi> But by that <hi>Nature,</hi> which is one
with the <hi>Law,</hi> towit, <hi>divine</hi> and <hi>heavenly,</hi> they might doe them. So
that thou canst not, but still be accounted, a wilful enemy to the <hi>Light,</hi>
whilest thou opposest it, and dost not turne to it, and by it, come to

<hi>legal duty,</hi> and in condescendence to the <hi>Iewes</hi> manner? for it was in

worship;</hi> for one man to take the <hi>bible,</hi> and speak upon it, and all
the rest to be excluded from speaking, while hee pratles, his owne
barren empty <hi>notions</hi> about it? shew me where that was the practise, or
order among the <hi>Apostles</hi> and primitive <hi>Christians:</hi> In the churches way
1. Cor. 14. there is no such thing, but on the contrary vers. 29.
<hi>let the Prophets speake two or three, and let the other judge, if any thing be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
to another that sits by, let the first hold his peace for yee many all prophecy,
one by one, that all may learne, and all may be comforted.</hi> By which it plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

of the maine inventions brought in, in the <hi>Apostacy,</hi> wherby barrennes
and drynes hath entred and wherby the quickning <hi>unlimited life</hi> has
beene stopped from flowing through many vessels. It is true the
<hi>Apostles</hi> at times cited <hi>Scriptures</hi> out of the <hi>law,</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> to
shew their fulfilling, or to open the mind of the <hi>Spirit</hi> concerning
them, which is frequent is our meetings, to cite <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and
open them in the same <hi>life and Spirit</hi> that gave them forth, in the order
of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> but not in the order and way of mans <hi>wisdome</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi>
as is your way, which savours more of Aristotles <hi>School,</hi> then of the
<hi>Church of Christ. Secondly</hi> as to what thou sayest that it is not our way
to encourage the People to read the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and to try <hi>doctrines</hi> by
them, 'tis utterly false, for wee desire that all may come to try doctrines
even by the <hi>Scripture,</hi> but wee bid them also come to the <hi>light</hi> in them,
to read and try <hi>doctrines,</hi> and understand the true sence of the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>

the heart; the <hi>inward command</hi> is never vvanting in the due season,
to any duty, as it is vvaited for, and the outvvard testimony or
signification of the command, vvee regard in its place. Is it not a
regarding the outvvard to mind the <hi>inward unction and spirit,</hi> to vvhich
it directs? vvhich invvard teacheth all things, and leadeth into all
truth. 1. <hi>Ioh. 2. 27. 1. Cor 14. 15. Iohn.</hi> 16. 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea, doe not
such more regard the outvvard, then they vvho under a pretence of an
<hi>outward command</hi> doe run about these things in their ovvne <hi>natural will
and Spirit,</hi> neglecting to vvait upon the <hi>Lord,</hi> for the leading and
help of his <hi>Spirit.</hi> Thy comparing us <hi>to servants, who will not be moved
to work, by their masters letter, &amp;c.</hi> is vaine and riduculous nor doth
it reach us, for our <hi>Masters</hi> letter is vvritt <hi>in our hearts,</hi> and ther wee

are, vvho use to vvrite <hi>letters</hi> to servants to set them on vvork,
while they are absent, and cannot help them by their presence, for
our <hi>Master</hi> is alvvayes vvith us, and hee requires us to doe all our

great duty, of <hi>wayting upon the Lord, in silence,</hi> out of all thy ovvne
<hi>thoughts</hi> and <hi>words,</hi> and art trampling it under foot, thou lookest,
upon it, as <hi>mispent time or a meer looking upon the ground;</hi> vvhereas if
ever thou comest to knovv the <hi>Scriptures</hi> a right, or to confer a
right, concerning them so as to proffit, thou must first come to that

               <hi>Thou</hi> canst not but smile, thou sayest, that a man of understanding, should
grant the Scriptures to be a declaration of Gods mind, and yet deny them to be
Gods VVord, for what is a VVord but a declaration of ones, mind.</p>
            <p>Ansvv. Here thy lightnes appears, vvhich darkens thy understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding:
if thou must needs smile, doe it, at thy impertinent reason,
for though a mans <hi>VVord,</hi> be the declaration of his mind, yet every
declaration of his mind, is not his <hi>word:</hi> for signes may be a declaration
of a mans mind, without his <hi>word,</hi> and people usually distinguish
betwixt a mans <hi>VVord,</hi> and his <hi>writ.</hi> And so though the <hi>scripture</hi> be a
declaration of <hi>Gods mind,</hi> yet it is not his <hi>VVord,</hi> properly nor can
those properties which are declared of the <hi>VVord,</hi> belong to the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
as hath oft beene demonstrated, but to that <hi>inward and living
VVord,</hi> as it doth declare it selfe whether in the heart, or in the
mouth. The <hi>VVord of God</hi> is like unto himselfe, spirituall, yea <hi>Spirit
and life,</hi> and therefore cannot be heard, or read, with the natural
externall senses, as the <hi>Scriptures</hi> can, nor does the <hi>Scriptures</hi> cited by
thee, as <hi>Hosea. 1. 1. Ioel. 1. 1. Isaiah. 38. 4. Ieremiah.</hi> 14. 1.
prove thy intent. For that <hi>VVord,</hi> vvhich came unto the <hi>Prophets,</hi>
vvas that from vvhich the <hi>scriptures</hi> vver given forth, vvhich <hi>VVord</hi>
you confesse vvas immediate from <hi>God,</hi> but you say, it is ceased to

Word? Thou mightest ss vvell reason thus, that vvhen it is
said, the <hi>Spirit of the Lord</hi> came upon such a one or to such a one,
that therefore the <hi>scripture</hi> is the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and so deny all <hi>Spirit,</hi> but
that vvhich, is the <hi>Scripture</hi> as some doe, in other <hi>Sects,</hi> calling the

through them, as the <hi>living VVord</hi> declared it selfe, vvas the <hi>VVord of
God,</hi> but not, the <hi>letter,</hi> or vvriting. And vvhereas thou sayest <hi>it is
all one to say, the scripture saith, and God sayeth. Answer,</hi> by vvay of
inference and collection, it may be said, they are one, becaus of
their agreement, yet the <hi>living VVord</hi> and speech of <hi>God,</hi> is not the

the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and seemed to esteeme them much, though they

Scriptures,</hi> as <hi>Pasor,</hi> translateth them, But wee doe acknowledge,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64468:15"/>
the <hi>Scriptures</hi> are to be searched, but are not to be rested in, which

they may prove an occasion of stumbling, as they did to the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees:</hi>

consequently Spirits, 1. <hi>Iohn. 2. 20. 26. Thirdly,</hi> thou sayest, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly,
there are strong delusions,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ans.</hi> there are so indeed. But
was there any more strongly deluded, then the <hi>Pharisees?</hi> Yet how
much did they lay claime to the <hi>Scriptures?</hi> how came they then to
be deluded who wer so skilled, in the <hi>Scriptures?</hi> according to the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64468:16"/>
letter of them? and the poor People, who were not so skilled, so
rightly to hit the matter?</p>
            <p>And as to thy <hi>question, what way, shall the delusion, be tryd, if you
neglect the VVord of God, and look only within?</hi> Answ: As for the <hi>VVord
of God, nor</hi> yet the <hi>Scriptures testimony</hi> wee neglect not, but what way,
thinkest thou shall the <hi>delusion,</hi> be tryed? If you neglect the <hi>Spirit
within?</hi> and look only upon the letter, and words vvithout you?
if the <hi>Delusion</hi> be strong in the heart, will it not twine, and vvrest the
<hi>Scriptures</hi> without, to cause the <hi>Scriptures</hi> to seeme for it? and suppose
a man be deluded with a <hi>Spirit of delusion,</hi> what can help him, but
<hi>God</hi> whose <hi>Spirit</hi> searcheth all the deepest things of <hi>Sathan,</hi> and can,
and doth dscover them, to those, vvho love to be undeceived and
are faithfull to <hi>God,</hi> in what they certainly know. And though the
same <hi>deluding spirit,</hi> who deceived first, may deceive over againe,
that makes nothing against the insufficiency of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> to discover,
the delusion, but if a man be deceived either first, or againe
he is to blame himself for his defect, in not being duely watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and faithfull, in what is discovered to him of <hi>God</hi> tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and certainly; Consider the tendency of thy argument
which strikes not only, at the certainty of the <hi>Saints faith</hi> now, from
the <hi>Spirit within,</hi> and the assurance of knowledge, there from, but
also strikes at the very certainty and assurance of all the <hi>Faith,</hi> and
knowledge the <hi>holy Prophets,</hi> and men of <hi>God</hi> had, from the <hi>Spirit
vvithin,</hi> when Seripture was not. Wee are in no greater hazzard to
be deceived now, then they were then. You that set up the <hi>Scripture,</hi> as
your only <hi>rule,</hi> the many <hi>sects</hi> of you, what jangling and contesting is
among you, while one pleads for his sence, and another for his?
which all proceeds from their wandring from the <hi>Spirit,</hi> that gave
forth the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> And as to satisfying of others, wee refer &amp; recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
them to the same <hi>Spirit in them,</hi> to receive their satisfaction from
that, which only can, and will satisfy them, who wait for it in singlenes.</p>
            <p>Pag. 18. And whereas thou sayest, <hi>the Saints, are led and guided by the
Spirit, but it is according to the Scriptures.</hi> So say wee too, But it doth not
therefore follow, that the <hi>Spirit</hi> hath so tyed and limited himselfe to
the use of the <hi>scriptures,</hi> as alwayes to use them, in every particular
step, of his guiding the <hi>Saints;</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> is free to use, or not use the
<hi>scriptures,</hi> at his pleasure, and guideth the <hi>Saints</hi> in many particular
steps of their life, for which, there is no particular <hi>scripture,</hi> either
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64468:16"/>
to approve, or disprove them in. As for <hi>the more sure VVord of Prophesy</hi>
wee grant it is the <hi>rule,</hi> but deny, that that <hi>more sure VVord,</hi> is the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
but it is that <hi>VVord</hi> in the heart, from which the <hi>Scriptures</hi> came,
and in, and by, which the <hi>Scriptures</hi> are to be interpreted; and is it not
grosse blindnes &amp; darknes, to say, the <hi>Scripture</hi> is more sure, then that
<hi>VVord, light, life,</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> from which they came? Had not the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>
all their sureness, from the <hi>inward testimony of the spirit?</hi> How then
can they be more sure? Thy example of the <hi>Schoolmaster,</hi> &amp; the <hi>coppy,</hi>
servs <hi>not</hi> thy turne, for the <hi>Spirit</hi> is unto the <hi>Saints</hi> both their <hi>teacher,</hi> &amp;
their <hi>Coppy.</hi> And they need not goe forth, for a <hi>Coppy;</hi> &amp; if they vvalk
according to this, by looking upon it, &amp; eying it, they shalbe good
Schollers &amp; Proficients, hee writes them, a living <hi>Coppy</hi> in their <hi>hearts,</hi>
engraves it on <hi>fleshly tables</hi> whereas they who looke upon no other <hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,</hi>
but the <hi>VVords</hi> without them, are those, <hi>who are ever learning, but
never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Pag. 19. Thou askest, <hi>why wee disjoine the Spirit and the Scriptures?
citing Isaiah 50. 21. Answ.</hi> Wee are not to disjoine, what the <hi>Lord</hi> put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
together, somtimes the <hi>Spirit</hi> joineth, or concurreth, with the
<hi>Scripture VVords</hi> and sometimes not, how many preach and pray,
and read the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and talke of them, without the joint concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of the <hi>Spirit?</hi> Which wee say, they ought not to doe, the
<hi>Scriptures</hi> should never be used to preach, and pray, &amp;c. But in the
concurrence, and assistance of the <hi>Spirit;</hi> for they are not of true
use, to any without the <hi>Spirit,</hi> but yee disjoine them, who would
have praying <hi>in the letter,</hi> and useing of it without <hi>the motion of the
Spirit;</hi> to such the <hi>Scripture</hi> is indeed but <hi>a dead letter,</hi> and it is nowayes
a reproach unto them, to be so called. Yea what are the best of men
without the <hi>Spirit,</hi> but <hi>dead men?</hi> and this is not a reproach to them,
but their <hi>Glory,</hi> so, nor is it to <hi>Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thou sayest, <hi>they are said to be a killing letter, and this shewes,
that they are not dead. Answ.</hi> A poor argument indeed! Can not dead
things kill, if men feed upon them? If thou feedest upon <hi>sand, gravell,
stones, shells</hi> will not these things kil thee though they be dead? And
if thou feedst upon the <hi>letter,</hi> without thee, and not upon the <hi>life,</hi>
thou canst not live; yea if one that lived, did depart from feeding upon
the <hi>life,</hi> to feed upon the <hi>letter</hi> it would kill him. And as for that
<hi>Scripture</hi> cited by thee, it makes very much against thee, to wit.

it say that the <hi>VVords, God</hi> shall put into their <hi>mouths</hi>

<hi>justification</hi> thou makest a large step, in that crooked path, of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt,
wherein? Thou hadst too much traced from the beginning,
but now more abundantly then ever, thou displayest the <hi>Banner</hi> of
thy disingenuity, and gatherest all thy forces together, it should
seeme, resolving to give the <hi>Quakers</hi> a finall, over throw; And
to make the matter misty in the very entry of it, thou raisest
Dust to thy self venting thy own filthy <hi>imaginations,</hi> under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of coming from them, applauding thy endeavours, as if thou
wert studying to preserve pure, the principle of <hi>justification,</hi> in a

a litle further <hi>Pag.</hi> 20. 21, having given a very scant account of their
doctrine, in this matter, couching it in most disadvantagious
terms, thou takest great liberty to extend thy selfe, in a foolish, and

discovered them to be either turned, or turning rank <hi>Papists,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

<hi>Secondly</hi> shew what vast difference is betwixt us, and the
<hi>Papists,</hi> therein.</p>
            <p>And <hi>thirdly,</hi> make manifest, how much nearer of kin yee are to
the <hi>Papists,</hi> even as to this particular, and the things relating there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto

and was made manifest, in the flesh, at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and also as
hee is made manifest, and <hi>revealed in us;</hi> and thus, wee doe not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
<hi>Christ,</hi> nor his righteousnes, <hi>without,</hi> from his righteousnes
<hi>within,</hi> but wee doe receive and embrace him, wholly and undivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<hi>THE LORD OVR RIGHTEOVSNES. Ieremiah.</hi> 23. 6. 1. 30.
By which wee are both made and accounted <hi>righteous</hi> in the sight of
<hi>God</hi> and which ought not, nor cannot be divided. And the manner
and way, wherby his righteousnes, and obedience death and
sufferings without, become profitable unto us and is made
<hi>onrs,</hi> is, by receiving him, and becoming one with him, <hi>in our
hearts,</hi> embraceing and entertaining that <hi>holy seed,</hi> which as it is
embraced and entertained, becometh a <hi>holy birth in us,</hi> which in
<hi>Scripture</hi> is called, <hi>Christ formed within; Christ within the hope of glory.
Gal. 4. 19. Coloss.</hi> 1. 27. By which the <hi>body</hi> of <hi>sin</hi> and <hi>death</hi> is done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
and wee cleansed, and washed, and purged, from our sins,
not imaginarily, but <hi>really;</hi> and we really, and truly made righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
and holy, and pure <hi>in the sight of God,</hi> which righteousnes is
properly enough said to be <hi>the righteousnes of Christ,</hi> for it is immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly
from him, and stands in him, and is as unseparable from him,
as the beams are from the sun, and it is, through the union, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
him, and us, (his righteous life and nature brought forth <hi>in
us,</hi> and wee made one with it as the branches are with the vine) that
wee have a true <hi>Title,</hi> and right to what hee hath done and suffered
<hi>for us,</hi> for, being so closely united to <hi>Christ, his</hi> righteousnes beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
<hi>ours, his</hi> obedience <hi>ours, his</hi> death, and suffrings, <hi>ours:</hi> thus
wee <hi>know hiw and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his
suffrings, being made conformable to his death, Philip.</hi> 3. 10. By which
nearnes, and fellowship, wee come to know, an <hi>unity</hi> with the
suffring seed, both <hi>in our selves,</hi> and others, and therein to travell,
for its raising, and deliverance; which yet no wayes derogats from
the worth of the sacrifice, hee offred up unto <hi>God,</hi> without the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
of Jerusalem, while hee humbled himselfe unto death, even
unto the death of the crosse, tasting death, for every man. This is
an honest, and plaine, and true account of our beleife in this
matter, and is in substance one, and the same, with that, which
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64468:18"/>
at sundry tymes, <hi>thou</hi> and <hi>thy brethren,</hi> hast received from us; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the bare, scanty, and disingenuous account thou givest
of us in this matter. <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to the vast difference, that lyeth
betwixt us and the <hi>Papists,</hi> any who are not willfully blind, may see
it, who know <hi>their</hi> Doctrine, and <hi>ours,</hi> in this thing.</p>
            <p>It is not the works, of <hi>Christ</hi> wrought <hi>in us,</hi> nor the works
which wee work, <hi>in his Spirit, and power;</hi> that wee rest and relye
upon, as the <hi>Ground and foundation,</hi> of our justification; but it is
<hi>Christ himselfe,</hi> the worker, revealed <hi>in us,</hi> indwelling <hi>in us,</hi> his
<hi>life,</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> covering us, that is the <hi>Ground of our justification,</hi> and
wee feeling our selvs <hi>in him,</hi> feeling him <hi>in us,</hi> and <hi>his Spirit, his life</hi>
covering us, wee feel our <hi>justification</hi> and peace with <hi>God in him,</hi>
and through him, the alone <hi>Mediatour</hi> betwixt <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Man.</hi> Now,
this manner of justification by the indwelling of <hi>Christ,</hi> in the <hi>Saints,</hi>
and of his <hi>Spirit,</hi> is not held by the <hi>Papists,</hi> but is expressly denied by
them, and disputed against, particularly by <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> And <hi>Christ
Iesus</hi> himselfe is both <hi>first</hi> and <hi>last</hi> our <hi>justification</hi> and <hi>foundation</hi> of it;
and as to being <hi>justified by works,</hi> the <hi>Scripture</hi> is plaine for it, and so
wee may not deny it, but plead for it, according to the true sence
and mind of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> as wee are taught of him. But to be justified
<hi>by him,</hi> is more then to be justified <hi>by works,</hi> and therefore are
wee justified <hi>in our works;</hi> which wee work <hi>in him,</hi> because,
wee are <hi>in him,</hi> and work them <hi>in him,</hi> and because the <hi>Lord</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth
and justifieth us, <hi>in him;</hi> therefore hee accepteth and
justifieth, <hi>our works,</hi> wrought <hi>in him,</hi> and accepteth and justifieth,
<hi>us,</hi> in relation to these works; and though it hath beene said, by
us, that Good works, which are wrought in <hi>Christ,</hi> and are rather
<hi>his,</hi> then <hi>ours,</hi> are <hi>meritorious,</hi> yet wee understand it not any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes,
then thus; that all their <hi>Merit,</hi> or <hi>worth</hi> is from <hi>Christ,</hi> and
seing they are said in <hi>Scripture</hi> to have their reward; and Reward,
and Merit, are relative terms, inferring one another, in that sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
wherin they are said to be <hi>rewarded,</hi> they may also be said to be
<hi>meritorious;</hi> which yet hinders not, the freedome of <hi>Gods grace</hi> in
justification, for wee doe verily beleive, and confesse; that both
the <hi>VVorks</hi> and the <hi>Reward,</hi> are of the <hi>free grace</hi> of God, and that the
<hi>Lord</hi> giveth us all things, not of <hi>Debt,</hi> or as being in our <hi>Debt,</hi> but
of <hi>free gift</hi> and his infinite goodnes and <hi>VVisdome</hi> hath seene it meet to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:64468:18"/>
promise a <hi>Reward</hi> to good works; and so hee doth reward them,
becaus of his goodnes, and faithfulnes, and not because he is
addebted unto any of us, otherwise then as hee hath bound himselfe
by his <hi>promise,</hi> And this is contrary to that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>alse <hi>Popish Doctrine,</hi>
which affirms, that men deserve a <hi>Reward</hi> from <hi>God,</hi> for <hi>good works,</hi>
upon the account of <hi>strict justice,</hi> without respect to the <hi>Promise.</hi> And
if it be <hi>answered,</hi> that all <hi>Papists</hi> doe not say so, but are more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
well then, I say If some of them be moderate, and passe from
the erronious opinion of <hi>Popery,</hi> and speake that which is true, if
others speake what is true also, <hi>in that particular,</hi> should the <hi>truth,</hi>
be accused, and condemned for ranck <hi>Popery,</hi> because, some <hi>Papists</hi>
at times confesse to it. You your selvs know, that <hi>Papists</hi> contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
one another in divers things, and where men directly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
one another, one of the sides, must speake true; But as to
that, wherin the <hi>justification</hi> stands, and on which it is <hi>grounded,</hi> to
wit, <hi>Christ himselfe</hi> as in dwelling <hi>in the Saints,</hi> none of all the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,</hi>
for ought wee ever heard, or read, doe owne it, but are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it. Againe as to the works by vvhich the <hi>Papists</hi> seeke to be
justified they are such, as vve beleive, none <hi>can</hi> be justified <hi>by</hi> viz.
their <hi>outward</hi> observations, their <hi>invocation</hi> of Saints, bovving to <hi>ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi>
saying <hi>Ave maries,</hi> telling their Beads, their <hi>Pilgrimages,</hi> their
<hi>whipping</hi> themselvs, their keeping <hi>Lent,</hi> and many other such like
works of <hi>voluntary humility,</hi> by which they seeke to be justified,
though they are evill vvorks, as not done <hi>in the faith,</hi> and povver of
God: nor does it serve thy turne to say, that <hi>Papists</hi> think not that
vvorks considered <hi>as evill and sinfull,</hi> are sufficient to justify them,
for that is not the question vvhether the Papists think to be justified
by vvorks sinfull and evill, but this is the <hi>Question,</hi> vvhether the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi>
think to be justified by <hi>VVorks,</hi> vvhich are really sinfull and evill,
(hovvever they may imagine them to be good) and herein I say,
vvee differ vastly from <hi>Papists,</hi> they think and seek to be justified by
such <hi>VVorks,</hi> as are evill, in the sight of <hi>God,</hi> vvhereas vvee beleive
that by no such vvorks can any man be justified. Other vveighty dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences

other things, So in these, relating to justification. <hi>First</hi> doe yee not
say, that yee are not justified by <hi>Christ</hi> in dvvelling <hi>in you?</hi> so say the
<hi>Papists. Secondly,</hi> Doe yee not say, that the vvay to attaine to a state
of justification, is not by beleiving in the <hi>VVord of faith,</hi> vvhich is <hi>in
every man,</hi> and in the <hi>Light,</hi> vvhere vvith Christ has enlightned eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man, that coms into the vvorld? And so say the <hi>Papists:</hi> vvho
though they talk of <hi>universall Grace,</hi> yet they deny that this <hi>Vniversall
Grace,</hi> is an <hi>Evangelicall principle of Light;</hi> by beleiving in which,
men can attaine unto a state of <hi>justification</hi> immediatly. 3. Doe yee not
say that <hi>Gods</hi> act of <hi>justification</hi> is not an immediat <hi>testimony</hi> of his <hi>Spirit,</hi>
declaring or pronouncing men righteous? And so say the <hi>Papists.</hi> 4.
Doe yee not say, that men are not to know their justification, or that
they are in a justified state, by an immediate testimony of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> in
them by vvay of object, for this vvere to assert <hi>immediate revelation?</hi> so
doe the <hi>Papists.</hi> So by these fevv. instances given here and by many
other instances given by others, in other particulars try your selvs,
and first clear your selvs, of <hi>Popery,</hi> before you, or thou doest
throvv it upon us.</p>
            <p>Now wher as thou alledgest, <hi>that the Apostle in the matter of justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
excluds all works, even those of Christ his working in the Saints, and
which they work in him,</hi> 'Tis falfe, nor doe the <hi>Scriptures</hi> cited by thee,
prove thy intent, as Rom. 3. 20, gal. 2. 16. Tit. 3. 5. thou sayest,
the <hi>Apostle</hi> speaks of works in generall without any limitation. But
herein thou contradictest the very expresse <hi>Scriptures</hi> cited by thee,
for all these <hi>Scriptures</hi> speake of works, with a <hi>limitation,</hi> as Rom. 3.
20, <hi>by the deeds of the law, there shall no fllesh be justified, and Gal.</hi> 2. 16.
<hi>knowing that a man is not justified, by the works of the law, here, the
works of the law</hi> are excluded, but not <hi>the works of Christinus,</hi> which
are not of the <hi>law;</hi> for the <hi>law</hi> or <hi>first Covenant</hi> was weak, and gave
not strength, to them, who wer under it, to fulfill righteousnes,
but these who were in <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> witnessed <hi>the righteousnes of the
law fulfilled in them, who walked not after the flesh, but after the spirit.</hi>
And as for that other <hi>Scripture Tit.</hi> 3. 5. though it exclude works of
mens doing, as of themselves yet it excluds not all works, nor <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
righteousnes</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> but expressely includs it, <hi>according to his
mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the holy
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64468:19"/>
holy Ghost;</hi> thou cauldest not have brought a more plaine proof against
thy selfe; for thou citest this <hi>Scripture</hi> as holding forth <hi>justification.</hi>
Now the Apostle sayeth, he saved us according to his mercy by the
<hi>washing of regeneration, and renewing of the holy Ghost,</hi> and is not the
washing of <hi>regeneration,</hi> and renewing of the <hi>holy Ghost,</hi> a <hi>vvork,</hi>
which comprehends many particular <hi>works,</hi> of the <hi>Spirit of Christ, in
the Saints?</hi> And is not <hi>regeneration,</hi> and the renewing of the <hi>holy
Ghost,</hi> a righteousnes wrought <hi>in us?</hi> How is it then, that thou art
not ashamed to charge us, with rank <hi>Popery,</hi> for saying, wee are
justified by a righteousnes wrought <hi>in us,</hi> seeing the very <hi>Scripture</hi>
cited by thee is expresly for it? May wee not pertinently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
these words upon thee, which thou misappliest to us, <hi>Oh,
tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the Streets of Askelon, &amp;c.</hi> That a
man, who pretends to teach others aright, in the matter of <hi>justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
hath so confounded himselfe, that to prove that <hi>justification</hi>
is not by a righteousnes wrought <hi>vvithin,</hi> bring a <hi>Scripture,</hi> which
speaks expresly of a righteousnes <hi>vvithin,</hi> to wit, that of <hi>regeneration</hi>
and renovation by which wee are saved. And if any should say the
vvords doe not say, vve are justified by the vvashing of <hi>regeneration</hi>
and renevving of the <hi>holy Ghost;</hi> but vvee are saved therby, as inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<hi>sanctification,</hi> and not <hi>justification:</hi> I <hi>answer,</hi> This helps not,
the <hi>Author</hi> out of the ditch, for he brings this <hi>Scripture</hi> forth applying
it to the matter of <hi>justification:</hi> But againe, if these vvords, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
<hi>all works</hi> generally, and vvithout any limitation, then they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
<hi>all works,</hi> vvhich are vvrought by the <hi>Spirit of Christ,</hi> from
<hi>sanctification,</hi> as if men, vvere sanctified by no vvorks of the <hi>Spirit of
Christ within them;</hi> or if it be said, that vvorks of our ovvne doing,
<hi>selfe-righteousnes,</hi> are only excluded, from having place in our <hi>sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification,</hi>
but not the vvorks, vvrought <hi>in,</hi> and <hi>by the Spirit of Christ;</hi>
then I say, vvhy may not the same distinction, have place in all these
other <hi>Scriptures,</hi> vvhich say, vvee are not <hi>justified by vvorks, &amp;c.</hi>
and indeed in all these Scriptures, it holds true no lesse concerning
<hi>sanctification,</hi> then concerning <hi>justification.</hi> As thus, <hi>by the deeds of the
Law, there shall no flesh, be sanctified,</hi> knovving, that a man is not
<hi>sanctified by the works of the Law,</hi> &amp;c. but it vvere vaine to infer from
this that men at <hi>Sanctified,</hi> by no vvorks of righteousnes, wrought
<hi>in them,</hi> by the <hi>Spirit of Christ</hi> therefore it is as vaine to infer that
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64468:20"/>
men are <hi>justified</hi> by no vvorks of righteousnes, wrought <hi>in them, by
his Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag</hi> 22. Thou sayest, <hi>wee can shift of popery with this, that they are
not our good works, which deserve and merit justification, but the good works
of Christs working in us.</hi> yea I say, wee doe justly cast of the accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Popery,</hi> as having the expresse testimony of <hi>Scripture,</hi> that
wee are justified by works, to wit, such as are wrought <hi>in Christ,</hi>
and by him <hi>in us, Iames. 2. 24. you see then, that a man is justified by
works, and not by faith only, compared with Tit.</hi> 3. 5. before-mentioned
and as for the <hi>Papists</hi> works, by which they seeke to be justified, wee
doe not acknowledge them to be such works, as whereby or wherein
any can be justified.</p>
            <p>And vvhereas thou pleadest, that the good vvorks of Christs
vvorking <hi>in us,</hi> are ours, citing <hi>Isai. 26. 12. Matth.</hi> 5. 16. &amp;c. Wee
grant it, but they are not <hi>ours</hi> in that signification, as vvhere it is
said, <hi>hee that is entred into his rest hath ceased from his owne works,
Hebr.</hi> 4. 10. There are works, which are so <hi>ours,</hi> that they are not,
the works of the sanctifiing renevving <hi>Spirit of Christ in us,</hi> and such
are works both of open unrighteousnes and of selfe fained righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
vvhich has no better root to bring them forth, then mans
ovvne <hi>will</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> and by such vvorks, vvee deny to be justified,
yea vve deny all such vvorks, and the <hi>justification</hi> by them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to stand in a continual denyal, unto them, and forbearance from
them: But againe, there are such vvorks, vvhich are so <hi>ours,</hi> that
they are <hi>Christs also,</hi> vvho vvorks them <hi>in us,</hi> and by <hi>us,</hi> and are <hi>ours</hi>
by his <hi>free grace,</hi> and by such <hi>works,</hi> vvee affirme men are justified.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 23. Thou pleadest, <hi>That men cannot be justified by any works of
Christs working in them, because they are imperfect.</hi> And for their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection,
thou instancest, 1. <hi>Faith;</hi> becaus it is said, <hi>O yee of
litle faith, why doubt yee. Answ.</hi> By this thou mayst as well exclude
faith, from <hi>justification,</hi> every way, as vvorks, if it vvere granted,
that their <hi>faith</hi> vvas imperfect; but that <hi>Scripture,</hi> nor no other, speaks
not of imperfect <hi>faith,</hi> but of little <hi>faith.</hi> Novv little <hi>Faith</hi> is perfect
in the measure of it, as a little <hi>Gold</hi> is perfect <hi>Gold.</hi> And though the
<hi>Disciples,</hi> had <hi>doubting,</hi> yet the <hi>faith,</hi> vvas not the <hi>doubting,</hi> nor vvas
it made impure by it, for the least measure of true <hi>faith</hi> can never be
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64468:20"/>
defiled, othervvise it could not purify the heart, it is like the fire,
vvhich cannot be defiled, vvith the impurities of those things, it
vvorks upon: And as for the <hi>Disciples,</hi> at that time, as they vvere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
part, justified, or approved by the Lord, in relation to their
<hi>faith,</hi> so were they reproved, and not justified of him, in relation,
unto, or becaus of their <hi>doubting.</hi> But this <hi>Scripture,</hi> nor none other,
provs not, that <hi>faith</hi> was, or is alwayes accompanied with <hi>doubting;
Abraham</hi> beleived <hi>Gods</hi> promise, without <hi>doubting;</hi> and was strong <hi>in
the faith, giving glory to God, and it was imputed to him for Righteousnes,
Rom.</hi> 4. 20. 21. 22. And said James, <hi>His faith was perfected by works,
Chap</hi> 2. 22. For that which is <hi>perfect</hi> in a lesse measure, can be
further <hi>perfected</hi> in a greater. Secondly, Thou pleadest that <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>
is imperfect, becaus the <hi>Apostle</hi> saith, <hi>VVe know, but in part,</hi>
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 9, But the Apostle does not say, our knovvledge is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect,
or impure: Wee may knovv a thing in part, and yet that
vvhich vvee knovv of it, vvee may knovv perfectly. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Thou
pleadest for the imperfection and uncleannes of the <hi>Saints</hi> obedience,
from <hi>Eccles.</hi> 7. But that place is not to be understood, concerning
all men in all states and times. There is an <hi>earthly</hi> unrenewed state
and while men are here, there is not a just man among them, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.
<hi>ver. 10. There is none righteous, no not one,</hi> and there is a <hi>heavenly</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
state, wherein <hi>a Man is borne of God, and sinneth not, Ioh,</hi> 3.
<hi>ver.</hi> 9. And said the Apostle, <hi>Let no Man deceive you, hee that doth
righteousnes is righteous;</hi> which imports that there are righteous Men,
who doe good; and said the Lord to the Servants that used their ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents,
<hi>VVel done, good, and faithful Servant, Matth. 25. ver.</hi> 21. 23.
And that other Scripture, thou citest <hi>Isai.</hi> 64. 6. Servs nothing thy
turne: For the <hi>Prophet</hi> sayeth not, <hi>all our righteousnes,</hi> which is of
thy working, in us, vvho are Saints, <hi>is as filthy rags,</hi> but <hi>all our
righteousnes,</hi> vvhich vvee, even the best of the Saints, can performe,
<hi>of, and from themselves,</hi> are as filthy rags, mans best works, his best
righteousnes, which is of, and from himselfe, is filthines, and
unrighteousnes before God; and hee is to cease from all his
ovvne works, <hi>Hebr. 4. ver.</hi> 10. And it is plaine that vvhen the
Prophet in that place sayeth, <hi>VVee are all as uncleane, and there is none,
that calleth upon thy name</hi> he does understand the multitude of the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vves,
vvho generally vvere a carnal People, and relyed upon their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvard

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:64468:21"/>
but did not understand it of all, and every one, among
them; for hee himselfe did call upon his <hi>Name;</hi> and that, the Saints
vvere vvashed, and cleansed, see 1. <hi>Cor. 6. 11. But yee are walked,
are sanctified, are justified, in the Name of the Lord Iesus, and by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of our God.</hi> And <hi>Ioh. 15. 3. Now yee are cleane, through the word,
which I have spoken to you.</hi> And <hi>Ezeki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

cleanse you, from all our iniquities, I shall also cause the cities to be inhabited.</hi>
Which imports a tyme upon earth, vvherein they should be made
cleane, from all their iniquities. And hovv art not thou, and you
ashamed to affirme, that the best vvorks of the <hi>Spirit of Christ</hi> in his
Saints, are as a filthy rag? Does not <hi>the Apostle</hi> say, that <hi>a meek and
quiet Spirit is an ornament, which is of a great price, even in the sight of
God;</hi> hovv then can it be, a filthy, or menstruous rag? A filthy
and menstruous rag, is good for nothing, but must be throwne
avvay, upon all accounts, and if that holynes, and righteousnes
and meeknes, vvhich is of Christ his vvorking in men, be as filthy
rags, then according to your doctrine, men should throvv them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvay,
as being not only unprofitable to justification, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t to any

as an <hi>Ornament,</hi> of great price, not only in the sight of the
<hi>Saints,</hi> but even in the sight of <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 24. Thou pleadst, though that the good works of <hi>Christ</hi> in the <hi>Saints,</hi>
are defiled &amp; imperfect because the <hi>Saints</hi> who are subservient, &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentall
in them, are uncleane, and who can bring a cleane thing
out of an uncleane? <hi>Iob. 14. 4. Answ.</hi> It is granted that the <hi>Saints</hi> are
subordinate co workers with <hi>Christ</hi> but yet it follows not, that his
works <hi>in them,</hi> aud <hi>by them,</hi> are defiled, and though it be said,
who can bring a cleane thing, out of an uncleane, this hinders not,
but that the <hi>Lord,</hi> can, and doth make Cleane, those<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who have
beene uncleane, and so out of them, who are made cleane, bring
forth, cleane things. And though, every one, in whom the work
of sanctification is begun, be not wholly cleansed, but that there
may be an <hi>uncleane part in them,</hi> for a time, yet there is also a <hi>cleane
part in them;</hi> who are in the least measure sanctified, and so these
who work with the <hi>Spirit of Christ;</hi> work with him, according to this
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:64468:21"/>
cleane part, and it is the cleane part <hi>in them,</hi> which hee maketh use
of, as his instrument; and as for the <hi>uncleane part,</hi> it is not to
worke vvith <hi>Christ,</hi> but to be chained dovvne, and fettered, and
bound up from working, to the end it may be vvrought upon, that
it may be cleansed, and thus by degrees, the <hi>cleane part</hi> encreaseth,
and the <hi>uncleane</hi> is diminished, till all the uncleannes be vvrought
out, and vvher the <hi>uncleane part,</hi> is let loose to vvork, the pure <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Christ,</hi> doth never joine in vvorking <hi>with it,</hi> but judgeth, and
reproveth it, and therefore, in so far, as the <hi>uncleane part</hi> vvorketh
in any, that man, in whom it worketh is not throughly justified,
and approved by the Lord, but there are who vvitnes the cleansing
from all the uncleannes; and so, as cleane vessels, and instruments
throughout, bring forth <hi>cleane things, cleane works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The example, hovv that <hi>cleane water passing through an uncleane
pipe, receivs a tincture of uncleannes, hits not the case:</hi> For the <hi>Spiritual
VVater,</hi> is not, like the common grosse outvvard <hi>VVater,</hi> vvhich,
an uncleane pipe can defile, but like the fire, and the light vvhich
though it touch uncleane things cannot be defiled by them: Every
thing of the Spirit, is undefilable, as the Spirit is, vvhich no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane
thing can defile. And if thou vvert vvel skilled in the outvvard
creation, thou mightst find an <hi>outward water,</hi> so pure that passing
through an uncleane pype shall not be defiled vvith it; but if thou
knovvest not, these earthly things, and beleivest them not, as
Christ said, <hi>Ioh. 3. 12. How shalt thou believe, if vve tell thee heavenly
things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 25. Thou chargest us, <hi>VVith erring grievously in confounding
justification and sanctification. Answ.</hi> Justification is either taken, for
<hi>God</hi> his adjudging a man, unto <hi>eternal Life,</hi> and in that sence it is
not to be confounded vvith <hi>Sanctification,</hi> yet it is not be separated
there from, for <hi>God</hi> adjudgeth no man, but the <hi>sanctified</hi> unto <hi>eternal
life,</hi> or happines; or it is taken, for the making a man righteous,
and then it is all one, vvith <hi>Sanctification:</hi> And that thou sayest the
vvord is <hi>most frequently used in Scripture, in that sence of adjudging, being
opposed to condemnation;</hi> doth imply, thou hast not the confidence to
assert, that it is alwayes so used as indeed it is not.</p>
            <p>And wheras thou citest <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 9. to prove, <hi>that the choisest Saints
upon earth have disclaimed all righteousnes, wrought in them, by which they
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:64468:22"/>
chould be justified;</hi> I say, that Scripture provs no such thing, and thy
observation to prove it, is insufficient; to wit, that the <hi>Apostle</hi> doth not
speake of his righteousnes, whilest he was a Pharisee, for that he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned,
<hi>ver.</hi> 6. 7. for admitting it, yet hee was still to deny and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owne
the work, and righteousnes, which could proceed from his
owne <hi>will,</hi> and <hi>Spirit;</hi> even all the willings, and runnings which can
arise from a mans <hi>selfe</hi> though he be a <hi>Saint,</hi> without the immediate
operation of the <hi>Spirit of Christ,</hi> the <hi>Saints</hi> have this to watch against,
to keep downe the active and working <hi>selfe-will</hi> and stop it from wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the <hi>selfe-righteousnes,</hi> which if it be not watched against, and
stood against, will fall a working its righteousnes, which <hi>God</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
not, as being but the bare righteousnes of man, and this is
that righteousnes, which <hi>Paul</hi> denyed to have, which hee even cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
the righteousnes of the <hi>Law,</hi> but this, (<hi>which is of the Law,</hi>)
thou cunningly omittest, (becaus it made against thee,) it seems.
Now what that righteousnes of <hi>God,</hi> through faith, was, which hee
desires to have, hee plainly expresseth, <hi>ver. 10. that he might know
him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings,
in being made conforme unto his death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, is not the knowledge of him, and the power of his <hi>resurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
a work of the <hi>Spirit of Christ</hi> in the <hi>Saints</hi> by which, they are
justified? according to that; <hi>by his knowledge, shall my righteous ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
justifie many:</hi> and is not the fellowship of his suffering, or the
suffering with him, a work of his <hi>Spirit?</hi> &amp; <hi>Lastly,</hi> is not the conformity
unto his death, a work of his <hi>Spirit</hi> in the <hi>Saint,</hi> comprehending the
whole work of <hi>mortification?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 26 Thy last argument, from 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21, is most absurd
and impious, for accordingly, it would follow, that <hi>as Christ was
made sin for us, or suffred for our sins, who himselfe had no sin, no not in
the least;</hi> So wee may be made <hi>righteous</hi> before <hi>God,</hi> though wee have
<hi>no righteousnes, no holines, no faith, no repentance, no mortification, no
good thing</hi> wrought <hi>in us.</hi> And doth not this strengthen, the wicked,
ungodly and profane in their presumption, to have title to <hi>Christ</hi>
his <hi>righteousnes?</hi> And so to returne thy misapplied instance in another
case, Suppose some of the profane, who plead a right to <hi>Christs righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes,</hi>
having lost some of their number, should happen to hear
thee disputing against all good works, as being profitable to justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:64468:22"/>
might they not say concerning thee, and thy brethren, who
teach such doctrine, <hi>wee have not only gott the lost sheep, but the lost
shepherds and the cheifest of them too, on our side,</hi> let us rejoice, wee have
found them? Wee find, the <hi>Apostle</hi> maks a farr better inference from
<hi>Christ</hi> his dying <hi>for us, 2. cor. 6. 15. he died for all, that they who live
might not any longer live to themselves, but to God;</hi> yea and every where
hee holdeth forth <hi>inward holiness and righteous,</hi> as that without which
no man, can lay claime to <hi>Christ; if any man be in Christ hee is a new
creature,</hi> but he doth not say, <hi>God</hi> reputes him a <hi>new creature,</hi> though
hee be not really renewed. And though it be said that wee are made
righteous <hi>in him,</hi> this hinders not, as thou vainly inferrest, <hi>that wee
are not made righteousnes, by an inward righteousnes;</hi> for hee is in the <hi>Saints</hi>
aud fulfills the righteousnes of the Law in them; <hi>that the righteousnes of
the law might be fulfilled in us, Rom.</hi> 8. 4. Therefore that 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21.
is thus to be understood, that <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> who knew so sin, was
made to be sin <hi>for us,</hi> that is suffered for <hi>our sins,</hi> that wee who had really
sinned, and so deserved <hi>wrath,</hi> might partake of the <hi>love</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> by
him, and through the workings thereof, be made the righteousnes
of <hi>God in him</hi> for that the Apostle understood here, a really being
made righteous, and not a being esteemed or held as righteous, while
indeed impure, is very evident, by the whole following chapter,
but especially towards the end, <hi>what fellowship hath righteousnes with
unrighteousnes, wherefore come out from among them, touch not the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Now to be received of the <hi>Lord,</hi> is to be justified of him, and
here wee see plainly, that in order thereunto, there is required a

            <p>And whereas thou sayest, <hi>that the holiest actions of the Saints, becaus of the

the <hi>Apostles</hi> sin in writing the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> in preaching <hi>Christ,</hi> and
gathering the <hi>Churches?</hi> Whither their being the instruments made
these things sinfull, which were done, not only by the command,

or corruption, as they came forth, from the <hi>Spirit</hi> of

               <hi>Pag. 26. Thou blamest it as an unsutable thing for a Quaker to say that
that people to whom hee is joined, are the most Christ-like Christians this day
upon the earth;</hi> and yet will any of you, say lesse of your way?
for if yours be not the best way, why doe yee plead so much for it?
Why doe yee preach it up? Why doe yee study to draw people to
it, and complaine of those who have left it? Now is not a good
<hi>Principle,</hi> a ready way to lead people to good practises? And are
not these who are in the right way, of the flock of <hi>Christ?</hi> And is
not <hi>Christs</hi> flock, like unto him? Can it therefore be an unsutable
thing for one who supposeth himselfe to be of <hi>Christs</hi> flock, to say,
the flock with whom hee is, is likest to <hi>Christ?</hi> Will any of you say
lesse, except yee grant your selves not to be of <hi>Christ's</hi> flock?
Wee ar not the most <hi>Christ-like people, sayest thou, by what wee out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly

by what wee inwardly feele, becaus others different from us, have felt as
much.</hi> As to the first, thou hast shewed thy ignorance of the very
appearance of <hi>Christiantiy:</hi> for the appearance of <hi>Christianity,</hi> is not in

to have dealing vvith the <hi>Spirit</hi> of it, and yet to keep to the, <hi>meek, low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

is to be like unto <hi>Christ,</hi> vvho did not retire himselfe unto a <hi>Hermits</hi>

and let the <hi>light</hi> in all <hi>consciences</hi> judge, vvho are likest to <hi>Christ. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
to evidence, that some different from us, have had as much
<hi>inward feeling,</hi> thou sayest, <hi>thou canst tell us of some, who have had so
much of the feare and dread of God, upon their hearts, that they durst not
adventure upon sin,</hi> by this thou seemest to grant, that there are
invvard feelings and enjoyments among the, <hi>Quakers, saying, what
good is it that you truely feell, that persons different from you have not felt?</hi>
And hovv doeth this consist, vvith your judging the <hi>Quakers</hi> fallen
into <hi>Apostacy,</hi> and delusion, of the devill? And that they are pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
vvith the divell? can such have invvard feelings and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God? for my part I am glad to hear, that any such have
beene, vvho have had so much of the fear and dread of God upon
their hearts, that they durst not adventure upon sin, and I should be
glad, and so I knovv vvould any of the <hi>Quakers</hi> be glad to meete vvith
them; But novv such vvho have so much of the fear of God upon
their hearts, that they durst not adventure upon sin, vvold they not
love to be perfect? vvould they dispute against perfection, and
conclude it impossible? vvould such, vvho dare not sin for a vvorld,
sin every day, yea every moment, as you say, yee doe? if they
dare not sin, vvould they not refrainse from sin, and cease from it?
and vvould they make use of that poor evasion, vvhich thou addest,
that therefore they vvould not vvillingly sin for a vvorld? As long,
as the dread and fear of <hi>God</hi> remains, and stands over the <hi>heart,</hi> sin
is shut out, and the minds vvill is to fear <hi>God,</hi> and not to <hi>Sin.</hi> Thou
<hi>canst tell us of others,</hi> (thou sayest) <hi>who many years lived in the sweet sence of
Gods favour, and have gone most triumphantly out of the world, with strong
perswasions, of their eternal vvel-being.</hi>

<hi>that singing of Psalms is an ordinance of Iesus Christ;</hi> vvhereby if
thou understandest that singing of <hi>Psalmes</hi> was used by the <hi>Saints,</hi> that it
is a part of <hi>Gods VVorship</hi> vvhen performed <hi>in his will,</hi> and by <hi>his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
and that yet it may be, and is vvarrantably performed among the
<hi>Saints</hi> it is a thing denied by no <hi>Quaker,</hi> so called, and it is not unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall
among them, wherof I have my selfe beene a witnesse, and
have felt of the sweetnes, and quickning vertue of the Spirit therein,
and at such occasions ministred. And that at times, <hi>Davids VVords</hi>
may also be used as the <hi>Spirit</hi> leads thereunto, and as they sute the
condition of the <hi>party,</hi> is acknowledged without dispute but that
without the <hi>Spirit,</hi> in <hi>selfe-will,</hi> not regarding how the thing sutes
their condition, for a mixt multitude to use and sing the expressions
of blessed David, wee deny. For that was not the method, the
Apostle spoke of 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 15. when hee said, <hi>I will sing with the
Spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also,</hi> therfore though sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of <hi>Psalms,</hi> in the true use of them, be allowable, yet as used
by you, it is abominable; and is a <hi>mock worship,</hi> becaus yee cannot
deny, but that the persons using it, are a mixed multitude, knowne

praise <hi>God,</hi> for they are dead in their sins, and it is the <hi>living,</hi> that
praise him, and not the <hi>dead.</hi> Next, all lying is abomination, but

the same thing, but as to you that use them, are false &amp; untrue. I say, as
thou doest, <hi>that though every Psalme does not sute our condition, yet in
every Psalm, there may be meditaion, for edification:</hi> but this no wayes
meets the case for there is a great difference betwixt meditating upon
a <hi>Psalme,</hi> &amp; singing one vvhereby vvee apply ourselves to the <hi>Lord,</hi>

an ordinance of Iesus Christ,</hi> for which thou givest as a reason, <hi>First, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
John baptised with water, and was really sent of God;</hi> Which thing
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:64468:25"/>
is not denyed, because <hi>Iohns baptisme</hi> vvas a <hi>Baptisme,</hi> vvith <hi>VVater;</hi>
But that that vvas the <hi>Baptisme,</hi> vvhich vvas to continue is the matter
in question: to prove vvhich, thou bringest in thy <hi>Second reason,</hi> that
<hi>the baptisme of Christ and the baptisme of Iohn differed only in circumstance,
and not in substance, because they agree in the Author, in the Matter, and
in the End.</hi> To which I answer, that though they agreed in the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,</hi>
that will not conclude them to be <hi>one,</hi> because by the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
it might be said, that the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> and the <hi>New</hi> are <hi>one,</hi> or
that <hi>Circumcision</hi> &amp; <hi>Baptism</hi> are one, for that <hi>God</hi> was the <hi>Author</hi> of both.
As to the matter, they are not one neither, for the one was a <hi>Baptisme</hi>
with <hi>VVater,</hi> and the other, a <hi>Baptisme with the Spirit,</hi> and <hi>with fire,</hi>
as Iohn himselfe distinguisheth them. <hi>Mark.</hi> 1. 8. Now in respect
<hi>baptisme with water</hi> can be administred, where the other, to wit, with
the <hi>Spirit,</hi> is not, therefore they are not one in <hi>Substance.</hi> They also agree
not in the end; for the end of the one, to wit, <hi>Baptisme</hi> with <hi>VVater,</hi>
is but to point or shew forth the other, So that as the <hi>shadow,</hi> and
the <hi>Substance</hi> differ in their ends, in like manner doe these two: for the
end of the shadow is but to point to the substance: the end of the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi>
in this thing being to cleansc, and purifie the heart produce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that effect to such as it is truly administred unto, but the <hi>shadow</hi>
is frequently administred, and the heart not cleansed, therfor they
differ in their ends. Now to shew, that they differ in <hi>substance,</hi> it is
written, Acts. 19. Vers. 2. 3. 4. 5. that there were of the <hi>baptisme</hi> of
<hi>Iohn, who had not so much as heard of the holy Ghost,</hi> far lesse received it.
Now had the <hi>Baptisme of Iohn,</hi> and the <hi>Baptisme of Christ</hi> beene <hi>one</hi>
they could not have had the one, and beene altogether ignorant of
the other. For a <hi>Third</hi> Reason, <hi>thou sayest, that Iesus Christ commanded,
and enjoined the Disciples to baptise, and that baptising they used water,</hi> But
wher hee commands them to <hi>Baptise,</hi> Math. 28. there is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
to baptise them with <hi>VVater,</hi> or into vvater, but <hi>into the name
of the Father, Son, and holy Spirit,</hi> So here is the baptisme into the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
but not into <hi>outward water,</hi> and the <hi>Apostles</hi> vvere <hi>Ministers</hi> of <hi>the
Spirit,</hi> and ministred the <hi>Spirit</hi> unto those vvho beleived. And
though they used the <hi>water baptisme</hi> at tymes, yet it rests to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that they did it in obedience to that generall command,
Math. 28. and not in condescendence to the people, vvho had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:64468:26"/>
a great esteeme of Iohn, and vvere so nursed up, vvith <hi>outward
Ceremonyes,</hi> that it vvas hard, suddenly to vveane them from such,
as they did the like in other cases, vvhich also servs for ansvver to thy
<hi>Fourth Reason,</hi> vvher thou instancest <hi>Peter his baptising Cornelius</hi> after <hi>he
received the Spirit,</hi> for Peters vvords imply no command, but only
that at that occasion the thing might be done, <hi>Can any man, said he, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
water, that they may not be baptised Acts.</hi> 10. 47. And though it be
said, Vers. 48. <hi>that hee commanded them to be baptised in the name of Christ</hi>
yet it holds forth no command from Christ, only the thing being
agreed upon, that it might be done, he bid doe it, but that the
<hi>Apostles</hi> received no commission to <hi>baptise</hi> vvith <hi>water,</hi> is clear from
that of <hi>Paul,</hi> vvhere he sayeth, <hi>I thank God, I baptised none of you but
Crispus, and Gajus, and the houshold of Stephanus, &amp;c: for</hi> said he, I
<hi>was not sent to baptise, but to preach the Gospell,</hi> 1. Cor. 1. 16. 17. Novv
it is not questioned, but his <hi>Commission</hi> vvas as large, as any of the
rest, for he himselfe said, that hee vvas not inferiour to the cheifest
of the Apostles: but, that hee thereby denied, hee vvas sent to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
the <hi>holy Spirit,</hi> vvhich is the <hi>baptisme of Christ,</hi> is absurd to
think: for a <hi>Fifth Reason,</hi> thou sayest, <hi>it is the will of Christ, that this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
should</hi> continue and <hi>abide in the Church, because hee promised to
be with his Ministers to the end of the VVorld;</hi> To which I answer, that
this promise related to the <hi>Baptisme of the Spirit,</hi> which is <hi>Christs Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme</hi>
is granted, but that it related to the <hi>Baptisme of water</hi> is denied:
for hee was with <hi>Paul,</hi> who yet professed, hee was not sent to <hi>baptise
with water.</hi> And whereas some give their meaning to <hi>Paul</hi> his words,
that hee was not sent only, or principally, to baptise with water,
this is an addition to the Scripture Words, for which they can shew
no sufficient ground: And if men will take a liberty to adde to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Words, from their owne <hi>Spirit,</hi> they may wrest the Scriptures, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
the worst of opinions, as when it is said, <hi>Thou shalt not bow downe
to them, nor VVorship them,</hi> one should put this meaning upon it: thou
shall not bow downe to them, not Worship them principally, and
therefore would averre that graven Images may be worshiped, this
were a most perverse abusing of Scripture. Sixthly, Thou sayest,

expressions. Ans.</hi> I hat such who cast off the <hi>Baptisme of Christ</hi> by the

               <hi>Spirit,</hi> may incurre that hazard, it is granted, but that any such thing
will follow from the not useing of <hi>water</hi> is denyed: as shall appear
by examining the Scripturs cited. The <hi>first</hi> is, <hi>Act. 2. 28. Repent
and be baptised every one of you, for the remission of your sins. Ans.</hi> Here is
no mention made of <hi>outward VVater,</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> and Remission of
sins may be, and are found without it, and where it is, both these
are frequently wanting: But though it should be understood of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
water, it is spoke but to particulars, and is no universal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.
The <hi>Second</hi> is, 1 <hi>Pet. 3. 21. The like figure whereunto, even bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
doth also save us:</hi> But the very follovving vvords doe give an
ansvver to that, and clear the meaning, not to be of Water baptisme,
saying, <hi>Not the putting away the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good
conscience towards God, by the resurrection of Iesus Christ.</hi> The <hi>Third</hi> is,
<hi>Act. 22. 16. Arise, and be baptised, and wash away thy sins.</hi> But that a
being baptised vvith vvater is a vvashing avvay of sin, thou canst not
from hence prove, seeing the contrary is abundantly vvitnessed, and
suppose Water-baptisme vvere here to be understood, it being but
spoke to one, infers no universal command. The <hi>Fourth</hi> is <hi>Ephes. 5.
ver. 26. That hee might sanctifie and cleanse it; with the washing of water.</hi>
But by vvater cannot here be understood <hi>outvvard VVater,</hi> but that
of the <hi>VVord</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> for the next Verse speaks of <hi>presenting it vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
spot, or vvrinkle:</hi> Which the <hi>outvvard VVater</hi> cannot doe, see the like
place <hi>Iohn. 3. 5. Vnlesse a man be borne of the vvater, and of the Spirit,
hee cannot enter into the Kingdome of God.</hi> Novv if by Water here, vvere
to be understood <hi>outvvard VVater,</hi> it vvould inferre that <hi>VVater baptisme</hi>
is absolutely necessary to <hi>Salvation,</hi> vvhich thou sayest, thou canst not
affirme vvith <hi>Papists. Lastly,</hi> thou citest, <hi>Gal. 3. 7. For as many as
have beene baptized into Christ have put on Christ;</hi> But <hi>VVater Baptisme</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be here understood, because many vvho are baptised vvith <hi>VVa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
never put on Christ, nor bear his <hi>Image,</hi> but the <hi>Divells,</hi> and are
found doing the Divels vvorks; So that none of these Scriptures
prove the <hi>VVater Baptisme</hi> to be of continual necessity, in the Church,
for it being but a figure, it vvas to give place to that <hi>one Baptisme,
Eph.</hi> 4. 5. And vvhereas, it is said by some, that the Water Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,
and the Baptisme by the Spirit is but one, because of that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
betvvixt the signification of the Water, and the Spirit,
thereby signified; this is a vvresting of this Scripture, as much, as if
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:64468:27"/>
one should say, rhat all the <hi>tipes figures,</hi> and <hi>shadowes</hi> of the <hi>old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
were one with the <hi>substance</hi> signified by them, and consequently
that these <hi>Tipes</hi> are all now to be upheld and used, whereas indeed, the
coming of the <hi>Substance</hi> ends the <hi>figures,</hi> among which are the <hi>divers
Baptisms,</hi> for so should the place be translated, <hi>Heb. 9. 10. which were
imposed untill the time of Reformation,</hi> but are no longer binding, since
the Reformation is come.</p>
            <p>Thou endest this matter, vvith asserting, <hi>That thou canst safely say,
that the Spirit of God concurring with, and blessing this ordinance;</hi> It is a
profitable meane to further our <hi>Salvation:</hi> but if so be it be no ordinance
of Christ, as heretofore is proved, then wee cannot expect, that
the <hi>Spirit</hi> will concurre with it; but indeed that hee is provoked by
it, considering the abuses in your <hi>administration</hi> of it: as <hi>First,</hi> in admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistring
it to <hi>Infants,</hi> for which yee have no command, nor example
in <hi>Scripture:</hi> Next, in causing ignorant people to promise and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
before God, that the <hi>Children</hi> shall forsake the <hi>Divel,</hi> the
<hi>VVorld,</hi> and the <hi>Flesh,</hi> while they themselves be slaves to all the
three, and many more abuses, as that vvhereby yee pretend to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roule
Children as Members of the <hi>Church of God,</hi> which is <hi>pure</hi> and
<hi>holy:</hi> it being oftentimes an occasion, of excesse and drunkennesse;
and is indeed, rather like an inrolling under the <hi>Divels banner,</hi> seeing
it is for most part accompanied with doing his work, therefore it is
so farre from being hazardous to contemne such an ordinance, of man,
that it cannot be, but hurtfull to continue in it.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Third place, Pag. 39. thou comest to prove, that the Lords
Supper so called, is an Ordinance of Iesus Christ:</hi> For which thou
bringst, as a <hi>First Reason,</hi> that <hi>Jesus Christ was the Author, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainer
of it,</hi> but that proves not; That it was to be of perpetual
continuance. Nor thy <hi>Second Reason,</hi> for though, <hi>the Disciples were
bid doe it, in remembrance of him, they were not bid doe it alwayes:</hi>
Neither will, <hi>Act. 2. ver.</hi> 42. which thou bringest as a <hi>Third Proofe,</hi>
serve thy turn, for by comparing it vvith <hi>Verse</hi> 46. it is evident,
that their breaking of bread was their ordinary eating, for it is said
<hi>they continued daily with one accord in the Temple, and breaking bread
fro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singlenes of
heart,</hi> so that this was a daily eating, <hi>from house to house,</hi> and not
at all such an eating, as years is, which you have but once, or
tvvice, or thrice in a year, or at such set tyms, as you appoint to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:64468:27"/>
your selves; whereas theirs was an eating from <hi>house to house,</hi>
wherein they received food sufficient to their bodily nourishment:
your eating is not so: You vvil not have your Sacramental Bread
and Wine, so called, to be used in private Houses, or, Familiies,
and your eating, is rather a mock-eating, vvherein you doe not
eat, that which is sufficient to the Bodily nourishment (as these did
<hi>Act.</hi> 2. 42. 46.) every one of you taking a little bread about the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of a Beane, vvherein you have no example from the Saints, but
rather from the <hi>Papists,</hi> vvho have their vvafers.</p>
            <p>Againe, this eating mentioned <hi>Acts. 2. ver.</hi> 42. 46. is conjoined
with this, <hi>that they sold their possessions, and had all things in com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>on,</hi>
and so they did eat together daily <hi>in common,</hi> which is not like
your eating; Now if you would make their example, and
and practise, your Rule, why doe y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e not sell your possessions,
as th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y did, and have things in com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>on? also why doe yee not
abstaine from eating blood, and things strangled, as they did?
and why doe yee not wish one anothers feet, <hi>which they were as so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
commanded to doe,</hi> as to take and eat, &amp;c: <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13. 14.
15. If you say, these things were but to continue for a time,
what ground have yee to affirme, that these were not alwayes
to continue, and those of Water-Baptisme and breaking bread
were to be alwayes continued; For a Fourth Reason thou sayest
<hi>Paul recommended the practise of this to the Church of Corinth. Cor.</hi> 11. 23.</p>
            <p>Answ. that hee recommended it unto them by way of command,
wee deny, for hee delivered unto them no command to practise it,
but that which hee delivered unto them was the Relation of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of fact as what the Lord did in the night, wherein hee vvas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed;
Thou sayest, <hi>The Apostle doth not only here relate the matter of
fact, but like wise warrants the frequent use of this ordinance:</hi> it is one thing
to warrant the use of it and farre another to command the use of it,
wee doe not deny but the use of it, vvas lavvfull, and vvarrantable
at that tyme, but vvee say, it vvas not commanded unto them,
but left, or permitted to them, as these vvords import, as <hi>often
as yee eat,</hi> &amp;c. and againe, <hi>let a man examine himselfe and so let him eat;</hi>
the vvords imply no command, but only that they vvere in the
use, or practise of it, and being therein hee gives them direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
hovv they might use it, so as not to receive hurt there by
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:64468:28"/>
Now that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were weak in many things, and did many
things by permission, is clear by the whole straine of that <hi>Epistle</hi> to
them. For a <hi>Fifth</hi> Reason; thou sayest, <hi>thou readest not in Scripture, where
Christ, and his Apostles did abolish it,</hi> Answ: if it were so, that then
there was no absolute need, for the very institution intimats the
abolishing thereof at Christ his coming, as to any necessity by way
of command, though afterwards it might have beene used by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
being gradually to passe away, as did other things, for
<hi>Circumcision,</hi> was abolished by the coming of Christ; yet it was used
after his coming, together with divers other <hi>Ievvish coremonies;</hi> But
as concerning the abolishing or ending of it see 1. Cor. 10. 15. 16. 17.
<hi>I speake as unto vvise men, judge yee vvhat I say, the cup of blessing vvhich
vvee blesse, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? the bread vvhich
vvee breake is it not the communion of the body of Christ?</hi> And then hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
to shew, what that bread was, for (saith hee) <hi>vvee being
many are one bread.</hi> Now what is that <hi>one bread?</hi> is it the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvard,</hi>
or is it the <hi>invvard</hi> and <hi>spiritual?</hi> if it be the outward, then
there is no inward and Spirituall bread, Or if it be the inward, and
Spirituall, which is that one bread, then that outward bread, (as
being, but a figure) is ceased from being of use, as to any necessity,
and this hee spoke unto the wise who saw beyond the <hi>shaddovv,</hi> and
<hi>figure,</hi> unto the <hi>substance,</hi> the end of it; which was that <hi>heavenly bread</hi>
and refreshment, which <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe giveth unto these <hi>souls</hi> to feed
upon, who know the mistery of his indwelling in them; which
<hi>bread</hi> is indeed his body. So that now the <hi>bread</hi> being <hi>one,</hi> which is
the <hi>body</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> the outward <hi>bread</hi> hath no place in the <hi>supper of the
Lord;</hi> for then there should be not <hi>one bread,</hi> but <hi>tvvo:</hi> for the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<hi>bread,</hi> and the inward are <hi>tvvo,</hi> and not <hi>one bread</hi> and if any
say, the outward <hi>bread,</hi> though it be not properly the <hi>body of Christ</hi>
and thing signified, yet it may be said to be one vvith it, because of
that agreement, betwixt the <hi>signe,</hi> and the thing signified.</p>
            <p>I ansvver, that is not sufficient, vvhy the outvvard <hi>bread</hi> should
be called the <hi>one bread,</hi> or one vvith the thing signified, othervvise by
the same evasion one might plead for the continuance of all the <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices</hi>
and <hi>offerings,</hi> of <hi>Ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>s,</hi> and <hi>Bulls</hi> and <hi>Goats,</hi> and say they are one
vvith that <hi>one offering of Christ,</hi> mentioned <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10. 14. becaus they
signified that one offering: Now were not this an abominable
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:64468:28"/>
vvresting of the <hi>Apostles words,</hi> to say, all these outvvard of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
vvere the <hi>one offering,</hi> becaus they did signify it? For
indeed hee does contradistinguish them, from this one offering,
that becaus of its being come, hee inferrs they were to passe away.
And so it is as plaine that the Apostle contradistinguished, betwixt
that <hi>one bread</hi> and the outward bread, together with the other <hi>Figures,
and shadowes,</hi> according to which, writing to the Colossians he
saith <hi>Coloss. 2. 16. 17. let no man condemne you in meat, or drink or holy
day, or New moone, or Sabbath days which are a shadow of things to
come, but the body is of Christ.</hi> And hee bids them seeke the things
above, and not the things, which the Apostle said, <hi>did perish in the
using, saying touch not, ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with <hi>Coloss.</hi> 3. 1. 2. which hee spoke, becaus they began to lay
too great a weight upon these things, and to hold them up as perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall,
which we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to passe away: for a <hi>Sixth Reason,</hi> thou sayest, <hi>the
Apostles, and Primitive Christians who did partake of the Spirit in a large
measure did use it.</hi> Ans. that they used it for some tyme is granted,
but that they used it as of necessity, or command, is denyed, nor
did they use it for themselves, but for the sake of the weake who
could not be suddenly weaned from it. Thy <hi>Seventh Reason,</hi> is, <hi>that
it is the mind, and will of God, that this ordinance should be continued in
his Church until the second coming of Christ to judgement,</hi> By which <hi>Second
coming</hi> thou, and you, understand his <hi>outward coming</hi> for which you
have no ground, to say, that hee bid them observe it, till his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
coming so many hundred years after: for the <hi>Scripture</hi> speakes
nothing so, but thus—<hi>yee shew forth my death, till I come:</hi> now
wee say, hee did come according to his promise in a Spirituall and
inward way of appearance in their hearts, feeding them, with the
<hi>heavenly food,</hi> and refreshment of his <hi>owne life</hi> and, <hi>Spirit</hi> which is
the <hi>substance,</hi> and concerning this coming hee spoke unto them, in
many places, particularly <hi>Iohn. 14. 18. I will not leave you fatherlesse, I
will come unto you. Yet a little while, and the world, seeth me not, but yet shall
see me: and ver. 23. If any man love me, hee will keep my word, and my
Father will love him, and wee will come unto him, and make our abode with
him:</hi> which coming was inward; according to <hi>vers. 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you in me,
and I in you.</hi> And those that witnessed him thus come, needed not out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
bread and wine to remember them of him, for his owne Spirit
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:64468:29"/>
would bring all things to their remembrance: they need not looke
upon the <hi>figure</hi> and <hi>shadovv,</hi> who have the <hi>Substance: Paul</hi> said, wee
looke not upon things, which are visible neither will Gods condes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendence
to their weaknesse, who were but newly redeemed from
out of a masse of heathenish <hi>superstitions,</hi> prove a command, or a rule
to the whole <hi>Church,</hi> or a warrant for any, now to be found in the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration</hi>
thereof; &amp; to hold up the outward <hi>figure,</hi> doe cloake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs,
by shutting out, , and denying the Spirituall appearance of
<hi>Christ,</hi> as hee doth immediatly reveal himselfe in his children, in whom
he has made manifest, the substance, which ends the shadow. For
an <hi>Eighth Reason</hi> thou sayest, <hi>that persons vvho cast off this ordinance, are
their soules great enemies, for they stand in the vvay of their soules Spirituall
good, in that this is a Spiritual nourishing, strengthening ordinance, where Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
food is offered, and delicate meat and drink, for strengthening believers, in
their journey to heaven;</hi> To vvhich I ansvver, that those vvho neglect
and despise having fellovvship and communion vvith God, and
laugh and scoffe at the usefull, and necessary duety of vvaiting upon
the Lord in silence, vvherein his children feele their soules nourished
with the <hi>Body,</hi> and <hi>blood</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and with <hi>spirituall Manna</hi> which des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cends
from heaven, and is distilled into their soules; not only, once,
or twice a year (which are the seasons, wherein that which thou
termst Spirituall food, is ministred among you) but daily, and
hourely, by the fresh <hi>incoms</hi> of <hi>life</hi> such indeed are to their souls, great
enemies, though they be sticking to the performance of some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
ceremonies wherein in former times, God (in condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to some, becaus of the simplicitie of their hearts) appeared,
and yet even then frequently, as much, and more, at other tymes.
But now the <hi>Sun is</hi> set upon those who will needs be upholding
the <hi>shadovv,</hi> in opposition, to the <hi>substance:</hi> therefore their <hi>table</hi> is
become polluted, and may more truely be termed the <hi>table</hi> of devils,
then the communion of the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> where a mixt multitude of
all sorts of wicked persons, living out of <hi>Gods fear,</hi> sit downe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
being seemingly in words excommunicated from approaching,
by the <hi>Preacher,</hi> and yet presently admitted to it, by the same: and
to turne away from such an <hi>Ordinance</hi> so called, is no sin, nor hurt,
but all who become obedient to the <hi>light of Christ</hi> in them, will find it
their place to forsake it, as being such an <hi>ordinance,</hi> vvhich the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:64468:29"/>
Apostle said, <hi>touch not, tast not, handle not, vvhich is all to perish vvith
the using.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the fourth place Pag: 41: <hi>thou vvilt prove, that the ministerie of the
vvord is an ordinance of Iesus Christ: becaus first Christ, appointed Ministers
and Pastors to be in his Church;</hi> But this cannot be asserted in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the <hi>Quakers,</hi> vvho grant the same. And vvhy citest thou, <hi>Eph.</hi>
5. 11. and. 1. for. 12. 8. which if they prove the contin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ance of <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
and teachers,</hi> prove also the continuance of <hi>Prophets, Evangelists,
and Apostles,</hi> vvhich yee deny. As to the <hi>second Reason</hi> that <hi>the Ministrie</hi>
is <hi>not common to all, but that there be some Pastors and teachers,</hi> is also ovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by us: Yet that hinders not, but that any at a time may speake,
vvhen the <hi>Saints</hi> are mett together, as the <hi>Lord</hi> moves by his <hi>Spirit.</hi>
according to 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 31. for it is one thing to be particularly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to the <hi>Ministrie,</hi> and another to be moved to speak at a particular
time: vvhich distinction that it vvas usuall among the <hi>Apostles</hi> in the
<hi>Primitive times</hi> is easilie observed, in the forenamed <hi>Chapter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> For a
<hi>Third Reason,</hi> thou sayest, <hi>whom God calleth to the Ministrie, he doth it
either immediatly, without the intervention of men, or mediatly by men
authorised for that purpose:</hi> but for this, thou bringst no proofe neither
art thou able to make out, that ever God called any under the
nevv covenant so mediatly to their <hi>Ministrie</hi> by men, as they vvere
not to have an immediate call in themselves: Though the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
of good and experienced men, in its place, is not denyed by
us, but dearly ovvned. <hi>Fourthly</hi> thou sayest, <hi>who ever pretends to an
immediate call they ought for the satisfaction of others to shew signes, and
tokens of their Apostleship<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> to which I ansvver. That those <hi>who come prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the Gospell not in speech only, but also in Power, and in the holy Ghost,
and in the evidence and demonstration thereof:</hi> As it is. 1. <hi>Thess. 15. and.</hi> 1.
<hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 4. give sufficient proofe that they are called of <hi>God,</hi> though
they come not vvith outvvard miracles. And though Paul came to
some vvith <hi>miracles,</hi> vvhere hee preached the <hi>Gospell,</hi> yet many
believed, vvho savv no outvvard <hi>miracle.</hi> Also many of the <hi>Prophets</hi>
vvrought no <hi>miracle,</hi> nor <hi>Iohn the Baptist.</hi> And though some miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
things came to passe about his <hi>Conception</hi> and <hi>birth,</hi> those doe not
of themselves prove him to be a Prophet, for miraculous things,
&amp; miracles vvere vvrought upon many, vvho vvere no prophets. If <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles</hi>
be necessarie to evince a man sent of God, hee must come vvith
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:64468:30"/>
these Miracles, before the people, vvhich <hi>Iohn,</hi> did not, nor did
<hi>Ionas</hi> come vvith any Miracle to convince the Ninivites, but simply
declared his message. And <hi>Iohn Calvin</hi> asserteth that there is no need
of Miracles, and yet hee maintaineth, that in his day, <hi>God</hi> raised
up <hi>Apostles,</hi> or <hi>Evangelists,</hi> saying, that it vvas needfull such should
be, to bring back the poor people, that had gone astray after <hi>Antichrist<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Lib. 4. Chap. 3. Inst.</hi> Neither did any <hi>Protestants pretend to doe any Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
they pleading against the Papists, that there was no absolute need of any
in respect they preached not a new Gospell, but that which was already confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with miracles by Christ, and his Apostles.</hi> And so thy plea against
us here, is the same, that vvas urged by the <hi>Papists,</hi> against the
<hi>primitive protestants. An evill and adulterous generation,</hi> said Christ,
<hi>seeketh after miracles;</hi> and though Miracles should be given, they
who will not beleive, the testimony of the Spirit of God in their
consciences, bearing witnesse to the truth, will not also beleive,
becaus of <hi>Miracles,</hi> as wee see plainly in the <hi>Jewes.</hi> And whereas thou
sayest, <hi>Iohns</hi> immediate call is evident by the special predictions both
of <hi>Malachy,</hi> and <hi>Isayas</hi> concerning him. So are there many speciall
predictions, concerning the Lord his pouring forth of his Spirit
upon many in these latter dayes, to prophecy or minister, as the
Spirit should putt words into their mouths, And as for these <hi>Scripturs
Tit. 1. 5. Ast.</hi> 14. 23. which thou bringst in the <hi>Fifth</hi> place they prove
not, that those Elders had not the <hi>Authority</hi> and call of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of
God in themselves. And whereas in the <hi>Sixth</hi> place thou sayest, <hi>though
Ministers be set apart, and ordained by men, yet their Ministry is not from
men, but from God,</hi> I answer; where the inward call and Authority
of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is not witnessed, it cannot be said to be of God.
And though <hi>Moses</hi> be said to consecrate <hi>Aaron,</hi> yet it doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovv
that <hi>Aaron,</hi> had no immediat call from <hi>God. Seventhly,</hi> thou
sayest, <hi>The ministry is so necessary, that it is the will of Iesus Christ, that it
should continue unto the end of the VVorld, Eph.</hi> 5. 12. 13. But thy proofe
from that Scripture is altogether impertinent as to you, vvho be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
not, that the Saints can be perfected in this life, seeing the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry
is given for the perfecting of them. And that this perfection
is on Earth, is clear, from the follovving verse, <hi>That hence forth, wee
be no more as Children tossed to and fro,</hi> for in the other life, there
is no hazard of being so tossed. And if the Ministry perfected not
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:64468:30"/>
men in this life, it no where perfecteth them, for in the other life it
hath no operation upon them. The <hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>Priesthood</hi> therof was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolished,
becaus it made nothing <hi>perfect,</hi> and if the <hi>Gospell Ministrie</hi>
should not make perfect it should also be abolished. And seeing your
<hi>Ministrie</hi> perfecteth not, it is not the true <hi>Ministrie</hi> of the <hi>Gospell;</hi> as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it is not, for it standeth not in the <hi>power of God,</hi> nor is it exercised
in the will &amp; motion of <hi>God,</hi> your Ministrie being such, that the whole
<hi>ESSE,</hi> or <hi>BEING</hi> of it, may be, without saving, <hi>grace:</hi> or true <hi>holines,</hi>
you expresly affirming that holines is not necessary, to the being of a
<hi>Minister</hi> but that a man may be a <hi>Minister</hi> of the <hi>Gospell,</hi> who ought to
be received, and heard, though hee have not the least graine of <hi>holines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Eighthly</hi> thou sayest, <hi>they who cast off the Ministerie of the word, wrong their
owne soules, &amp;c.</hi> Ansvv. if it be understood of the <hi>Ministry</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> it
is granted, but of yours, it is denyed.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Fifth place Pag.</hi> 44<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thou vvouldst prove <hi>that the Lords people,
are under a tye, &amp; engagement to keep the first day of the vveek for a Sabbath</hi>
For a <hi>First Reason,</hi> thou sayest, <hi>the Fourth commandement requires the
keeping holy of one day of seven;</hi> but as it requires the observation of
<hi>one day of seven,</hi> so it expresly instanceth that day to be <hi>the seventh,</hi>
vvhich day yee keep not: vvherfor as to the <hi>Second Reason, If the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
be morall and perpetuall,</hi> as thou callest it, <hi>it ought to be kept in every
point of it;</hi> vvhich yee not doing, therein condemne your selves,
but the outvvard <hi>Sabbath</hi> or the keeping <hi>one day</hi> of the vveek, for a

Reason,</hi> thou sayest, <hi>that Iesus Christ plainly intimates the continuance of
a Sabbath, becaus that speaking of the desolation of Ierusalem, he said,

but that <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> is neither here nor else vvhere said to be the <hi>first
day</hi> of the vveke. The Jevves vvere to fly at that time and <hi>Christ</hi> holds
forth their difficulties, that it should be grievo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the strictnesse of it, but as for any of your <hi>Sabbath</hi> keepers they are
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:64468:31"/>
not so strait-laced, but they will doe lesse necessary things, then to fly
from a danger on that day. And as the outward Jew, de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ireth, that hee
may not be putt to fly, on his outward <hi>Sabbath,</hi> so the inward <hi>Iew,</hi>
in <hi>Spirit,</hi> desireth much more that hee may keep his <hi>Sabbath,</hi> which
is his Spirituall rest in <hi>Christ,</hi> that the enemy oft seeketh to breake,
to cause him to fly on his <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> but this to you is a Mistery. Viz.
what the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> of them who beleive, is <hi>Heb. 4. 9. 10. There remaineth
therfor a Sabbatism, to the people of God, and hee, that is entred into his rest
hath ceased from his owne works, as God did from his.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that this <hi>Sabbath,</hi> or rest is not an outward <hi>day,</hi> is plaine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus
in the next <hi>verse</hi> hee saith let us labour therefore to enter into
that rest. But if it were an outward day it might be easily entred
into, but this is such a <hi>rest</hi> as none can enter into; who hearken not to
the voice of the <hi>Lord,</hi> by beleiving and obeying it. For a <hi>Fourth Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
thou sayest, <hi>though yee keep not the same day the Iewes did, yee have
the same authority for keeping your day, that they had for theirs. Hence this
day, that wee keep</hi> (sayest thou) <hi>is called the Lords day Rev. 1. 10. it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
set apart by the Lord for his service, and as a Special memorial of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,</hi>
Answ. but for all this, here is no probation at all, but meer
assertions. If yee have the same <hi>Authority,</hi> produce it, and let us see
it. <hi>Iohn</hi> was in the Spirit on the <hi>Lords day,</hi> therfor the <hi>first day</hi> of the
week ought to be kept, how hangs this together? Prove that <hi>Iohn</hi>
meant the <hi>first day of the week:</hi> wee read much in <hi>Scripture,</hi> of <hi>the day of
the Lord,</hi> which is the <hi>Lords day,</hi> but no where doe find it called the
<hi>first day</hi> of the week, or any other <hi>naturall day.</hi> For it is <hi>spirituall,</hi>
and as <hi>God</hi> called the <hi>naturall light, day,</hi> so hee calleth the <hi>Spirituall
light</hi> of his appearance (where the <hi>Sun of righteousnes ariseth with healing
under his wings</hi>) Day. And this is the day of the <hi>Lord,</hi> wherin his
people rejoice, and are glad. And whereas thou sayest, <hi>it is set apart by
the Lord, as a Speciall memoriall of his resurrection.</hi> This is thy naked as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion,
without any shadow of proofe &amp; if thou wilt say, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is to be a holy day, becaus hee rose on it. Is not this a faire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
to all the <hi>Popish</hi> holy Dayes? If yee keep one day for his Resurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
why not one day for his <hi>Conception,</hi> another for his <hi>Birth,</hi> another
for the <hi>Annunciation</hi> of the Ange, another for his being crucified, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
for his Ascension? &amp; then wee shall not want holy dayes in good
store. <hi>Fifthly</hi> thou sayest. <hi>who oppose the Sabbath day, sin against mercy,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:64468:31"/>
and equity, and Iustice. Answ.</hi> It is granted, bnt who oppose your day
which yee have made, or imagined, to be the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> doe not
sin against any of the fore-said, if in other things they keep
unto the rule of mercy, and justice. <hi>First</hi> they sin not against
mercy, if through <hi>all the dayes</hi> of the week, they be found in that,
which is for the good of themselves, and their neighbours. Not lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
too heavie burdens, upon their owne soules, by excessive care
and labour in outward things nor yet forcing their bodily strength,
beyond the rule of <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> nor imposing any things upon either
servants, or cattell, contrary to <hi>mercy.</hi> For if the Law required
<hi>mercy,</hi> even in these things, much more the <hi>Gospell,</hi> so that wee
grant, times of rest are to be given unto <hi>Servants,</hi> and <hi>Beasts,</hi> and
Mercy is to be shewed unto them, more then under the <hi>Law.</hi>
And thus is the end of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> answered, <hi>which was made for man:</hi>
yea, this is indeed to keep the <hi>Sabbath.</hi> To <hi>undoe every burden, and to let
the oppressed goe free,</hi> both as to the inward, and the outward. And
the <hi>Lords People</hi> have frequent times, more then once a week, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
laying aside their outward affairs for a season, they may and doe
meet together, to wait upon the Lord, and be quickned, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed,
and instructed by him, and worship him in his <hi>Spirit.</hi> And
may be useful unto one another, in <hi>exhortation,</hi> or <hi>admonition,</hi> or any
other way, as the Lord shall furnish; And such who find any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper
upon their minds, through letting them goe forth too much
upon outward things, may find the Lord allowing them any other
day, or time, no lesse then that, to gett their hearts reduced into
a right frame. And it were sad, if the Lord had only allowed, but
<hi>one day</hi> of <hi>seven,</hi> unto this effect. The <hi>Lord</hi> inviteth and alloweth the
weary, and distempered, (who love to be cured of their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>empers)
to come unto him every day: And as for those, who abide not in a
due care every day, to have their hearts ordered arights, but let
their minds goe forth excessively in outward occasions, all the week,
they provoke the Lord, to shut them out from accesse to him, upon
the <hi>First day.</hi> And our <hi>soules</hi> doe oft blesse <hi>the Lord</hi> in allowing us ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times of refreshment, and strengthning, to the establishing and
confirming us in his love and life, and disburdening our minds of
earthly things, much more frequently, then <hi>in one day of seven.</hi> And
as for sinning against Justice, they cannot be charged with it, who
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:64468:32"/>
give up unto the Lord, not onely one day of seven, but all the
seven, even all the dayes of their life unto his service: for equity and

               </gap>stide calleth upon us to spend all the <hi>seven</hi> in his service, that our
hearts may continually be exercised in his fear, and love, and what ever
wee doe, wee may doe, it to him, and in him. And as for the <hi>first day
of the week<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> we meet together even on that day, (as wee doe on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
dayes) according to the practise of the primitive Christians, to
wait upon the Lord, and worship him, but to plead so obstinately
as yee doe, that the <hi>fourth Commandement,</hi> bindeth to a particular obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of that day, and yet to be found so slack in the observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it, as you generally are, is such an inconstancie as the <hi>Quakers</hi>
cannot owne. And so whereas thou wouldst confine the Lord his gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
rest, and comfort to the <hi>souls</hi> of his people, and the falling of
the <hi>Manna,</hi> to the <hi>first dayes,</hi> calling them <hi>spirituall market dayes,</hi> as
if there were no other, wee cannot owne it, knowing that the <hi>Lord</hi>
giveth rest and comfort, every day, and causeth the Manna plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to fall every day, to those that walk in his fear, and wait upon
him; and hee has no such circumscribed Market day as thou drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest
of, but that yee, (I meane the Priests) make a Market day, of
that day (So that yee may call <hi>it your day,</hi> as thou sayest Pag. 44.
<hi>our day</hi>) wee know, wherein you sell, and vend your <hi>Babylonish,
commodities,</hi> and will be forceing, and compelling, all to come,
and buy of them, or if nor, to send you mony, whither they receive
ought, or not; or else yee will endevour by the help of the <hi>Magistrate</hi>
to have them punished. So that it is made manifest, that it is only
the inventions of men, that wee disovvne, and not any of the <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
of Iesus Christ.</hi>

lyes at the door of <hi>Infants,</hi> who never actually, sinned, vvee deny. For
a <hi>Second Proofe;</hi> thou citest <hi>Rom. 5. 12. Alleadging it should be rendred,
that in Adam all sinned.</hi> But it is no such matter: For the words,
however they be truly translated, can never be so rendred <hi>in Adam all
sinned:</hi> The strictest translation of the words is thus, [upon which
all have sinned, or in which all have sinned] Now, if the words be
translated. [<hi>Vpon which all have sinned.</hi>] They hold forth, hovv that
<hi>Adam,</hi> by his sin gave an entrance to Sin in the World, and Death by
Sin, and so upon this occasion, all others, have sinned, to wit, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
in their ovvne Persons, so that all vvho ever sinned ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually,
it was upon the occasion of Adams sin. For the Apostle is
here speaking, not of <hi>Infants,</hi> who are not capable of any <hi>Law,</hi> but
of such, as have a <hi>Law,</hi> and act against it. Yea from the Apostles
words in the other following Verse, it is plaine, that sin is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to <hi>Infants.</hi> For saith hee, Sin is not imputed, where there is
no <hi>Law.</hi> Now there is no <hi>Law</hi> given to <hi>Infants</hi> as such. For they are
not capable of it. What the <hi>Law</hi> sayeth, it sayeth to them, vvho
have in more or lesse some exercise of understanding, which <hi>Infants,</hi>

unto, and obeyed, it killeth: and so <hi>in this seed</hi> all have sinned, who
ever did actually sin; and as for the verse 18, of <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. which is
commonly used to prove infants guiltie, and under condemnation, it
is not tightly translated for the word judgement, or condemnation,
or guilt, is not at all in the Greek, but those, who have drunk in
this imagination, have added this word, to the Scripture so bending
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:64468:33"/>
and bowing the Scripture to their false opinion. And whereas tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
sayest. <hi>wee were all in the loins of Adam,</hi> and therfore wouldest inferre,
<hi>that infants are sinners in him, or guiltie of his sin.</hi> I say, It followes not,
more then to say, wee are guiltie of all the sins of our Fore-fathers,
becaus wee have beene in their loins; again thou labourest to prove
that <hi>Infants</hi> are sinners becaus they are subject to pains, and diseases,
and death. But this proveth them not to be sinners, as it proveth
not that the <hi>Earth</hi> is a Sinner, or that the <hi>Herbs,</hi> and <hi>Trees</hi> of the
field are sinners, for even these things have suffred, by <hi>Adams</hi> fall, a
great decay: And as for the <hi>outward Death</hi> of those that are saved
from <hi>eternal Death,</hi> it is rather a <hi>sleep,</hi> then a <hi>Death,</hi> as <hi>Christ</hi> said,
concerning <hi>La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

not Dead, but sleepeth.</hi> And therefore, that Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6: 23.
cannot be applyed, to them, who dye not, or perish not eternally:
for though the <hi>Saints</hi> lay downe the outward man, it is not as the
punishment or reward of their Sins, which are forgiven, and from
which they are delivered. And so the <hi>sting of Death,</hi> being taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
in those who are saved, it is not <hi>that Death, which is the wages of
Sin,</hi> and seeing the <hi>Apostle</hi> said unto the Saints, that all things were
theirs, even Death, it cannot be that their Death should be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
the wages of their Sin, how many of the blessed <hi>Martyrs</hi> have
looked upon their suffering a most violent Death, for truth, and
righteousnes as a <hi>Gift</hi> of <hi>God?</hi> How then could it be said to be the
wages of their Sins; which implye as if their Sins were not all freely
forgiven?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag. 48. From this doctrine,</hi> thou sayest; <hi>it will follow, First, that
all Infants, that die in their infancy, are saved, and though charity may be
pleaded for this opinion,</hi> (thou sayest) <hi>yet what Scripture can be alledged
for it?</hi> Answ. If, I should bring that Scripture, <hi>Suffer little Children
to come unto me, for of such is the Kingdome of Heaven,</hi> It will much more
naturally flow from the words, then that they ought to be sprinckled,
which is the meaning yee put upon them. And whereas some ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
it is not said <hi>of them,</hi> but of <hi>such.</hi> I answer, but that such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth
<hi>them,</hi> and all others, who are like them, in harmles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:
otherwise if they had beene excluded hee would not have given
it as a reason, why hee bid suffer them to come unto him: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
the 18. <hi>Chap. ver. 20. of Ezekiel,</hi> is a plaine proofe, <hi>The soul

that the <hi>Son</hi> be found acting the same iniquity, and continuing in it;
for then <hi>hee visits the iniquities of the Fathers upon the Children.</hi> Now thou
hast produced no <hi>Scripture</hi> to prove, that any <hi>infants</hi> doe perish, and
indeed there is nothing in <hi>Scripture</hi> for it, but against it. <hi>Secondly</hi> thou
sayest, <hi>it would follow, that infants dying in their infancy, stood no in need of
Christ, as a Saviour; for hee is a saviour to save his People from their sinnes.</hi>
Answ. Hee is a <hi>Saviour</hi> not only to save <hi>from sins,</hi> but also from the
<hi>consequences of sin,</hi> and not only from the <hi>fruits</hi> and <hi>branches</hi> of it, but
from <hi>the seed:</hi> and they are saved from <hi>sin,</hi> who are not suffered to fall
into it. And so these <hi>infants,</hi> whom the <hi>Lord</hi> takes away in their <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancie,</hi>
that they might not sin, are saved from it. It is <hi>salvation,</hi> to
be kept from falling into a pit, as truly, as to be taken <hi>out of it,</hi> after
the falling in. And as for that Scripture, it maketh against you,
<hi>Math.</hi> 1. 12. For it speaketh of a <hi>salvation</hi> from <hi>sin,</hi> wheras you dreame
of a salvation <hi>in your sins:</hi> Nor doeth <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 24. Speake of <hi>infants,</hi>
so thy citing it here is impertinent. And though there be a time,
wherin there is a crying out for deliverance from the <hi>body of sin, and
death,</hi> yet there is also a time of deliverance from it; even before the
laying downe of the <hi>outward body,</hi> as is plaine from <hi>Rom. 6. 6. 7. Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this that the old man is crucified, and hee that is dead, is freed from sin.</hi>
Yet wee acknowledge there is great occasion to be low, and to be

who fall away, never attained unto the <hi>Regeneration,</hi> and so were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

it, they fall, and cannot but fall away: And as for <hi>Ierem.</hi> 32. 40. ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by thee, it should be translated thus, <hi>I will putt my fear into their
hearts, that they may not depart from me,</hi> so <hi>Iunius</hi> and <hi>Tremellius</hi> ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
or <hi>not to depart from me,</hi> as the Septuagint hath it. Now to say, <hi>that
they may, not depart,</hi> is one thing, and to say, <hi>they cannot depart,</hi> is
another. Yet where the <hi>fear of God</hi> coms so to be raised and established
in <hi>the heart,</hi> over all, wee beleive such <hi>cannot depart,</hi> but every one,
is not attained to that <hi>State,</hi> where yet the <hi>fear</hi> of <hi>God</hi> may have some
place. And as touching these other <hi>Scriptures. Ioh.</hi> 10. 27. 28. 29. And
<hi>John.</hi> 13. 1. and. 1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 2 19. they speake of those, who are come
to a <hi>through Regeneration,</hi> who (wee doe beleive) can never fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;
as being be got into the perfect <hi>Nature</hi> of the elect <hi>sheep</hi> and <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi>
Nor doth it follow, from this that one may be a <hi>Child</hi> of <hi>God</hi> to
day, and a <hi>Child</hi> of the divell to morrow, for these, who are once,
properly the children of God through a true and <hi>through regeneration,</hi>
can never become the children of the <hi>divel,</hi> nor be cast out of <hi>Gods</hi>
speciall love, that hee beareth to his owne children. For to end this
matter, <hi>thou sayest it is safer to question the truth of the graces of those that
fall away, then the doctrine of the perseverance of the Saints.</hi> But doest
thou looke upon the <hi>Quakers,</hi> as having fallen away? if thou doest,
how comes it, that thou bespeakest them in thy <hi>Epistle,</hi> as those,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:64468:34"/>
who have had reall Grace, saying to them, did yee attaine to that
knowledge of, and acquaintance with God, which yee have, in
the use of ordinances? and againe, yee did run well, who did hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
you? And againe, why should they asperse these ordinances,
which have beene the means of their conversion? Or are these words
only a <hi>Ioabs</hi> kisse, by vvhich thou vvouldest kisse the <hi>Quakers,</hi> vvhile
in the meane tyme, thou hast a svvord hid under thy cloak to strike
them thorough, under the fifth rib. But the <hi>Quakers</hi> are avvare of
thee, and having on the armour of God, are out of thy reach.</p>
            <p>In the last place. <hi>Pag.</hi> 50. thou undertakest to prove, that our er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
(as thou callest them) <hi>tend to irreligiousnes, and Atheism;</hi> becaus
they tend to take avvay the vvorship due to <hi>God,</hi> but it hath beene
heretofore proved, that vvee deny not true <hi>VVorship,</hi> but only
your <hi>idolatrous superstitious worships,</hi> vvhich cannot truly be called the
<hi>VVorship of God.</hi> Our vvay (thou sayest) <hi>tends to irreligiousnes;</hi> becaus
frequently, <hi>wee goe to meat, and come from it,</hi> vvithout seeking a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
or returning <hi>thanks;</hi> which is to deny <hi>God</hi> a part of that Worship,
vvhich is due to him. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 4. 5. Ansvv. to receive the gifts, and
benefits of <hi>God,</hi> vvith thanks giving and to vvitnes it blessed, and
<hi>sanctified to us, by the word, and prayer,</hi> is ovvned by us: and to
knovv this so, vvithout taking off the hat, or using of formall speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of vvords, (though it be a thing frequently used by us also)
tends to no irreligiousnes:, for it is a thing usuall among us, vvhen
vvee sit dovvne to eat, to vvait upon the Lord, <hi>for some time</hi> that
vvee may feel his presence, and knovv ourselves stated in his fear,
to vvhich the blessing is<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and as vvee there stand, if any outvvard
expressions, be required of any, then in <hi>Gods fear,</hi> they may utter
them, and this is to knovv, the blessing indeed, and to be in the
place, that is blessed. But for people that are conversing, out of
Gods fear, stated in a Light airy Spirit, not only many tym<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s
laughing and scoffing, but some times even blaspheming, present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
so soone as the meat cometh, to clap off their hats, and speake a
fevv vvords in a custome, and so soone, as they have done, fall to
their former vvork againe: is not this Atheisme, and irreligiousnes?
for if such did think of <hi>God</hi> aright, and knovv, vvhat it vvere to
fear him, they vvould be far from addressing themselves in such <hi>pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>
unto him, neither could they be so impudent, as to expect a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:64468:35"/>
from him, while they stand in that condition, to which the curse
is annexed.</p>
            <p>In the second place. <hi>Pag.</hi> 51. Thou sayest, <hi>Doth not the taking men
off from prayer, tend to Irreligiousnes, and Atheisme? Now you teach, wee
must not pray in private, nor in families, without an impulse therefore.</hi>
Answ. This is no sound argument; to take men off from prayer,
tends to irreligiousnes, is granted, but to say, that a man cannot,
nor ought not to pray, without the Spirits, drawing, and motion
which you commonly name by impulse (a vvord, vvhich common
people doe not understand) hath no such tendency, or, that it takes any
off from prayer, truly so called is denied. For hath that a bad tendencie
which take's men off from such <hi>Prayers,</hi> as are abomination, &amp; are not
true Prayers, but <hi>hypocritical,</hi> and deceitful? As all such Prayers are that
are performed without the help of the Spirit. Wee say, whosoever can
pray to the Lord indeed, let them pray, wee are not to forbid them,
but, that any can pray without the Spirit that wee deny, according to
1. <hi>Cor. 14. 15. I will pray with the Spirit, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26. like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
also, <hi>The Spirit helpeth your infirmities, for wee know not, what wee
should pray for, as wee ought:</hi> Now if wee know not, what to pray for,
without the <hi>Spirit,</hi> how can wee pray without it? <hi>Paul</hi> durst not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
upon this duty, without the assistance of the Spirit (yea, hee
said, no man could say, that Jesus is the Lord, but by the <hi>holy Ghost</hi>)
but here, an arrogant generation will needs by praying without
it, which yet is not <hi>Prayer,</hi> and such families where this only is used,
cannot be truly said to call upon <hi>God,</hi> while such truely may be said
so to doe, that wait upon the <hi>Lord,</hi> and stand in his <hi>fear,</hi> and bring
forth the fruits of righteousnes, though they be not, so much in the
external signification of words, which also at times is found in our
families, as the Lord requireth it, and giveth utterance. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
thou sayest, <hi>That thou beleivest it will be found, that some of us, for the
space of a whole Yeare have not so much, as once bowed a knee to call upon
God in their families.</hi> What ground hast thou, for this thy beliefe?
May they not bow their knees in their families, though it be hid from
the observation of malicious eyes, who may so asperse them? May
they not pray in secret, and be seene of the Father to pray<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> according
to <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 6. Though they cannot be seene by the eyes of malicious
Spyes? And where a publick testimony in words is required, it is
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:64468:35"/>
also given, nor doe wee know any friends of truth, who have any,
whom they can joine with in Prayer, in the family, but doe meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the family, and wait together, breath together, and pray
together, and that much oftener, then thou insinuats, sometimes
without, and sometimes with the outward signification of words,
so that wee returne this thy charge as false and malicious. Thou sayest,
<hi>If this impulse be denyed for Years, men all that while (according to us)
must not pray.</hi> But here thou speakest as one, wholly unacquainted
with the wayes, and motions of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> to suppose such a case,
which cannot be; for the breathings, and motions of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and
especially unto Prayer, are very frequent, unto those who wait for
them, and are as necessary unto the <hi>Children of God,</hi> as their dayly
bread, yea and more, which the Father withholdeth not, but giveth
in due season. But many times, the <hi>Spirit of Prayer,</hi> is felt to move,
and is answered, when there is no liberty given, to speake words,
in the hearing of others; nor is thy other supposition lesse vaine, and
foolish, that <hi>if aman, were at the gates of death, and in danger of present
drowning, yet without an impulse,</hi> (as thou callest it) <hi>hee must not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
to cry to God for mercy, and help;</hi> for suppose he did cry,
vvithout all help of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> vvhat vvould it avail him, vvould it
have any acceptance vvith <hi>God?</hi> Shew us, vvherever a <hi>spiritlesse</hi> pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer,
vvas accepted of <hi>God,</hi> or required: Nay, it is a <hi>vaine oblation,</hi>
vvhich is expresly forbidden, and it is expresly commanded,
that praying be alvvayes <hi>in the spirit. Eph.</hi> 6. 18. And as for the <hi>Saints,</hi>
vvhen they are dying, or in any difficulty, wee know, the <hi>Spirit</hi> of
prayer will never be wanting, to breath through them, at such occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;
and to give words, as there is a service for them.</p>
            <p>But further, thou alledgest, <hi>that this Principle of ours, leadeth to
woefull security, for what need you be d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

God</hi> (thou sayest) <hi>or any other piece of service, seing you have salve
at hand to heal this sore, and that is, the want of an impulse.</hi> Answ. If
any fall into security and refraine prayer, it is not, that our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
leadeth into it; for our Principle leadeth out of all security,
into continuall <hi>watching unto prayer,</hi> and wating upon the motions of
the <hi>Spirit of God;</hi> now if any feel not these motions, they are nothing
the lesse guilty, becaus by their neglect, they provoke the Lord to
withhold them, and render themselves out of frame to feel, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:64468:36"/>
them, and thus who neglect the <hi>worship of God,</hi> are justly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
condemnation, and if they have peace, it is but a false peace, which
will faile them; and as for our peace, wee have found it, to be great
peace, but wee have not come by it, after such a way, as thou doest
falsely, and rashly judge: as by neglecting the <hi>worship of God,</hi> and
stopping the mouth of conscience, but by being turned to that <hi>living
VVord</hi> and <hi>Law of God</hi> in our hearts, by loving it, and cleaving to it
yea by receiving the reproofes &amp; chastisements of <hi>God</hi> through it, and
submitting to the judgement of it, when it hath beene <hi>as a hammer,
and as a sword, and as a fire in us, breaking in pieces, and destroying all
that false unsound peace, wee had created to our selves, in the day of our alien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
from the light of God in us.</hi> And unto peace wee are come,
through great tribulation of soule, even such, as thou art a stranger
unto, being ignorant both of the one, and the other, and so hast
therein shewed thy folly in judging what thou knowest not. And as
for woefull security, wee know not, where it more abounds, then
among hypocriticall professors, who, with the <hi>VVhore</hi> in the <hi>Proverbs,
offer up their sacrifices of morning and evening prayers,</hi> and thereby create a
peace to themselves, though they let their hearts goe a whoring af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
their lusts all the day: did not the <hi>Pharisees</hi> pray much outwardly,
and were much in orher outward practises of devotion, and so created
a false peace, and esteeme unto themselves? And can you deny, but
that there are many such among you, who make up a false peace, to
themselves by leaning upon their outward performances? Now what
If I should charge this upon your <hi>Principle</hi> wouldst thou think it fair
dealing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Pag. 52. Thou sayest, <hi>Doth not that opinion, tend to Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isme,
which rendreth mortification of sin</hi> (even in this life) <hi>useless, &amp;c.</hi>
Answ. Here thou dealest disingenuously. Is <hi>mortification</hi> of sin use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
where the end of it, is attained? And is not <hi>perfection</hi> the end of
<hi>mortification?</hi> Againe thou sayest, <hi>The opinion of a sinles perfection,
wounds the very vitals of Religion?</hi> Answ. Who could have expected,
that one, that pretends to Religion, would have beene so brazen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced,
as to put such an expression in print? What is the end of true
Religion, but to lead out of sin? Do the vitals of Religion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
in sinning, or in not sinning? If it consist in sinning, then they
that Sin most, are most religious: But if it consist in not sinning and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:64468:36"/>
keeping the commandements of God, without sin, then to plead for
such a thing as attainable, hurteth not the vitals of Religion? What!
Cannot the Saints live better without sin, then with it? Yea surely,
they can live well without that, which is a burden, and as Death
unto their life: they whose life is in sin, cannot live but in sin, but
the <hi>Saints life</hi> is not in sin, but in <hi>righteousnes:</hi> And thy consequences
are vaine and foolish, as 1. <hi>That men need not pray for pardon of sin,</hi>
2. <hi>That they need not the Blood of Christ, to cleanse them from sin, 3. That
they need not repentance:</hi> For wee grant, that all have sinned, and so
need those things, by which they may attaine unto perfection, and
who witnesse perf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

being turned from them unto righteousnes, which is the fulfilling of
repentance. And vvhereas thou sayest, <hi>Bring me to the particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
that is sinlesse, and I shall apply to him, that of the Apostle. 1. Ioh.</hi> 1. 8.
Thou shevvest openly thy confusion, for by thy applying to him, that
of the Apostle, vvouldest thou inferre a sinlesse man to be a sinning
man? That is a contradiction, but though vvee should bring a man
to thee, that is made free from sin, by the <hi>power of God;</hi> Thou couldest

be acceptable to the wicked, but most impleasing to <hi>hypocrits,</hi> who can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
the one, but not the other But now, let us examine, whither your
<hi>Principles,</hi> or ours, be most acceptable to the wicked, and <hi>hypocrits.</hi> 1. Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
men, and Hypocrits love well to hear that they can never be free from
their sins, in this life, and that they must alwayes sin. 2. They love well to
hear, to be justified by <hi>Christ without</hi> them, and his righteousnes without,
but not by him, and his righteousnes <hi>within them.</hi> 3. They love well to hear,
that the words without them, are the only Rule, which they can wrest accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their owne corrupt inclinations, but they love not to hear, that the
word, and <hi>light of God within,</hi> is to be their rule, which they cannot
wrest, nor bend. 4. They love well, to hear, that they may use the fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and customs of this world, bow, and cringe and give, and receive the
honour of this world. they love to hear, they may use sports, and games,
and playes. 6. To wear laces and ribbons, and gold rings, and other super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity.
7. They love well to hear, that men must not expect to hear God
immediatly, being such as those who said, let not God speake unto us. 8.
They love well to hear, that water baptisme, giving of bread and wine,
are the ordinances of God, and the true Baptisme and Supper, for then they
think they are Christians if they partake of these outward things, and they are
mad against us, who call them shadowes: and as for their observation of that
called the Sabbath, wee find, none more plead for it, then profane light men,
and women, for they can easily dispence to hear a man talk for an hour, or
two, and then have all the rest of the day, to spend in idlenes, vaine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,
and frequenting the <hi>alehouse,</hi> and decking themselves with vaine
apparell. 10. They love well to hear, that they may be <hi>members of the
Church,</hi> though they have no infallible evidence of holines. 11. They love to
hear of your doctine of <hi>election</hi> &amp; reprobation. 12. And of your doctrine once
in grace, &amp; ever in grace, wherby they feed themselves in presumption, &amp; care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesnes.
Many other particulars could be mentioned, but these may serve
enough to shew, that your Principles are pleasing to the wicked and <hi>hypocrits,</hi>
and our displeasing. Next to come to expecience: where are the <hi>drunkards, the
swearers, the whore mongers, the envious licentious persons, the scorners, the mockers,
whither are they yours, or ours?</hi> If our Principles be so acceptable unto them,
why doe they not inrolle themselves among us, why doe they oppose us at
our meetings, at Aberdeene, and else where, and curse, and rant, and use all
manner of filthy communication and are ready to stone us on the streets: And
none more found so doing, then that young fry, and spawne of the <hi>Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,</hi>
who are bred at your nurseries of learning. Now whose <hi>Church mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi>
are those, yours, or ours? is not the <hi>proverb,</hi> verified of you: Foules of
one Feather, fly together.</p>

saying, <hi>follow with they blessing, that which WE have beene about.</hi> Meaning the
<hi>Quaker</hi> and thy selfe, but it was none of the <hi>Quakers</hi> work; the Dialogue not
