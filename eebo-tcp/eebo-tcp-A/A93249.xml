            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Now as it is the wiſdom of God in bringing about his own deſigns, to raiſe up fit, and ſuitable inſtruments, for the work of every Generation. So it is alſo the gratious diſpenſation of <hi>God,</hi> to put ſeaſonable words into the mouths of thoſe his Servants, who by faith, do fix their <note place="margin">Prutitus diſputandi ſcabies eccleſiae.

            <p>That the ſouls of his hearers being captivated with the inward beauty and glory of Chriſt, and being led into an experimental knowledge of heavenly truths, their ſpirits might not evaporate, and diſcharge themſelves in endleſs gainleſs, ſoul-unedifying, and conſcience<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perplexing queſtions: For as it is in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a man that hath taſted the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of honey, will not eaſily be perſwaded that honey is bitter. But he that hath only taken it up upon credit, may ſoon be baffled out of it, becauſe no act can go higher then its principle; and ſo it is in Religion; for thoſe good ſouls that have imbraced the truths of Jeſus Chriſt, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſupernatural principle, and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimented not only the truth but the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of them, in their own ſouls, they are the <hi>clinched chriſtians, the good hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt

Whereas thoſe that have only a form of godlineſs, a ſlight tincture, who have only out of novelty and curioſity, or pride and ambition, or other ſelf ends, profeſſed Religion, will prove giddy and unconſtant, like Clouds carried about with every blaſt; and while they promiſe themſelves liberty, be a prey to the net of every fancy and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
            <p>To the ſound and practical Christian that is not ſqueeſie ſtomacked, will the truths in this treatiſe be grateful, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing therefore, and deſiring, if thou are not, thou may'ſt be ſuch a one. Here is offered to thy conſideration, a divine and heavenly Diſcourſe betwixt <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> between a <hi>ſoul-burthened ſinner, and a burthen-removing Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thou may'ſt here ſee how diligent <hi>Mary</hi> is to ſeek, how ready <hi>Chriſt</hi> is to be found. <hi>Mary</hi> hath her heart brim full of ſorrow, <hi>Chriſt</hi> Comes as it were <hi>leaping over the Mountains</hi> with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
<pb facs="tcp:170043:4"/>
and bowels of compaſſion. <hi>Mary</hi> was in a ſtrong pang of affection; nay her affections were wound ſo high, that her expreſſions ſeem broken, and her acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons might ſeem to ſavor of irregularity, were it not to that excellency of the object, did warrant the height of her affection, and the compaſſion of Chriſt was large enough, not only to interpret for the beſt, but alſo to pardon and cover all her infirmities. The woman was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at her affections, then expreſſions. <hi>They have taken away my Lord,</hi> ſhe ſpeaks at random, names no body, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Jews, or Diſciples, or Souldiers. But ſee the ſtrength of her faith, ſhe is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to call him Lord, even in the loweſt ſtate of humiliation, though Chriſt be reproached, perſecuted, deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, rejected, dead, buried, yet he ſhall be <hi>Maries</hi> Lord. Again, I know not where they have laid him, ſhe dreams of a bodily aſportation, and reſting of Chriſt ſomewhere, and ſpeaks with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, as if ſhe looked upon it as an indignity, or incivility, nay of cruelty, <hi>Saevitum eſt in cadavera, ſaevitum eſt in oſſa, ſaevitum eſt in cineres. Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>

of the Roman Emperors cruelty, to remove a dead body. What was done to Chriſt, <hi>Mary</hi> takes it as done to her, and good heart ſhe thinks ſhe hath ſo much right to him, that he ſhould not be ſtirred without her knowledge. And <hi>I know not where,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now while <hi>Mary</hi> is ſeeking Chriſt, <note place="margin">Ideo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſa eſt, quia an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geli aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rexerunt praeſentiae Chriſti. Gerfon. <gap reason="foreign">

Sometimes a poor ſoul wants the ſight of comfort, more then matter of comfort, and is like <hi>Hagar,</hi> weeping for water, when the well is hard by: ſeeking of Chriſt is the ſouls duty; but Chriſt manifeſting himſelf is the ſouls comfort. <hi>Mary</hi> turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her ſelf, and ſhe ſaw Jeſus. <hi>Gerſon</hi> ſaith the Angels roſe up at the preſence of Chriſt, which <hi>Mary</hi> ſeeing, made her turn about; but omitting that conjecture, The original word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> is ſometimes uſed for a turning of the face; but moſt frequently for a turning of the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: but to put it out of doubt here, it is ſaid exegetically, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb facs="tcp:170043:5"/>
back. Many times Chriſt hath his face towards us, when we have our backs upon him, and therefore if thou wouldeſt finde Chriſt, turn thy ſelf to him.</p>
            <p>Again, here thou may'ſt ſee the true <hi>Joſeph,</hi> he knowes <hi>Mary,</hi> when ſhe knows not him, but takes him for the <hi>Gardner.</hi> Chriſt is alwayes before-hand with us in his grace, he loves us before we love him, and calls us before we call him. <hi>Mary</hi> travails with deſires to find Chriſt, and Chriſt is full of yernings towards her: like <hi>Joſeph,</hi> he could refrain no longer, and becauſe the general manifeſtation of Chriſt wrought little, he calles her by her name <hi>Mary,</hi> and ſhe being a <hi>ſheep of Chriſt, knowes his voice,</hi> and anſwers him with a title of dignity, <hi>Rabboni,</hi> that is to ſay, my Maſter.</p>
            <p>We may ſee here, that diſcoveries of grace are not fruitleſs, they ſtir up in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, reverence, and obedience. Let us ſin becauſe grace abounds, is the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils application of Chriſts Doctrine.</p>
            <p>Theſe and ſeveral other particulars, are with much brevity, ſpirituality, and perſpicuity handled in this Treatiſe, and
<pb facs="tcp:170043:6"/>
with that livelineſs that they ſhew they come from one, whoſe own heart ſavored what he taught to others. The largeſt part of this Book is ſpent upon that ſweet Doctrine viz. <hi>A Believers intereſt in God as a Father,</hi> and the comforts that flowe from that ſweet relation. The foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of our relation to <hi>God</hi> is here handled, and how <hi>God</hi> is firſt a Father to Chriſt, and in him to us. What can be more comfortable in this <hi>earthly intereſt ſhaking,</hi> disjoynting confounding age: then to clear up to our ſouls an intereſt in <hi>God: Tolle meum, &amp; tolle Deum,</hi> as he ſaid, it were better for me there were no <hi>God,</hi> then that he ſhould not be my <hi>God,</hi> this will be thy comfort, that when thou canſt not ſay, my ſtate, my liberty, my Houſe, my Land, my friend, my Trade, thou may'ſt be able to ſay, <hi>my Father, my God.</hi> If therefore thou ſavoreſt the things of God, this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ſubject will be acceptable and grateful to thee, and if this Treatiſe may be any wayes inſtrumental, for putting thee upon ſtudy how to get it, or upon practice how to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it, or in caſethy ſoulſits in darknes,

            <p>His firſt apparition of all was made to <hi>Mary,</hi> the woman out of whom he had caſt ſeven Devils. She was much beholding to him, and therefore loved much. No Sex may diſcourage any ſinner from Chriſt. She expreſſeth her love to Chriſt, by her deſire of finding him, by her ſeeking &amp; weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, notwithſtanding all impediments before ſhe found him. As ſhe wept, ſhe ſtooped down and looked into the Sepulchre, and there ſaw two Angels in white, a colour of glory, purity and joy, becauſe it was a time of joy; they were one at the head, and the <note place="margin">Exodo 25. 20,</note>other at the feet. As in the Law, when the Mercy-Seat was made, two Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims were alſo fram'd and placed, one at the one end, and the other at the other end thereof, with their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces looking one towards another. And
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:170043:8"/>
when Chriſt was riſen, there were two Angels, one at the head, another at the feet, to ſhew that peace was to be expected in the true propitiatory, Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>One at the head, the other at the feet of the body of Jeſus. And they ſate there; it was a time of peace; peace was made between Heaven and Earth, God and man, and here is a poſture of peace, <hi>They ſate quietly.</hi> In Chriſt, Angels, and we are at one, God, and we, and all. There is a reca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulation, and gathering of all things <note place="margin">Col. 1. 20.</note>in Heaven and Earth.</p>

            <p>Now beſides the apparition of the Angells, here is the ſpeech of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels Woman why weepeſt thou? they knew ſhe had no cauſe of weeping; for Chriſt whom ſhe ſought, was riſ n a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
            <p>She anſwereth, becauſe they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him. If it had been as ſhe ſuppoſed, there had been cauſe enough of her weeping, if her <note place="margin">Preſence of Chriſt comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</note>Lord had been taken away; for when the Lord is taken away, what remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that is comfortable? And if the Lord be not taken away, it matters not what is taken away; for he is all in all. Carnall people, ſo they have their wealth, and friends, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts in the world, they care not what is taken away. But ſhe is of another mind. They have taken away my Lord, and what comfort can I have, if
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170043:9"/>
my Lord be taken away.</p>
            <p>But it was but the ſpeech of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, ſhe did but think it. And there were two things might lead her, <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>probability,</hi> which is the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of opinion. <hi>Probability,</hi> he is not here, therefore he is taken away. <hi>Truth</hi> Chriſt promiſed he would riſe again, therefore he would take away him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. There was certain truth to <note place="margin">weakneſſe of faith now ſeen.</note>ground faith, and weak probability to ground opinion; yet ſuch is the nature of weak perſons in diſtreſs: if there be probability &amp; certain truth, yet they will be ſure to cleave to their probabilities. Oh theirs be great ſins, I, but there is greater mercy for faith to lay hold upon. So the preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſinner faith, God is mercifull, I, but God hath excluded thee from Heaven, thou art an adulterer, a ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, a filthy perſon, thy opinion is <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 9.</note>grounded ſcarce upon probability. God is mercifull, but not to ſuch ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as live in ſins againſt reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as thou doſt. Therefore when one hath but probability to ground opinion, and the other certain truth to ground faith, be ſo wiſe for our
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:170043:10"/>
ſouls, as to take the beſt, and leave the other. If ſhe had remembered his promiſe, to raiſe himſelf out of the grave, ſhe needed not to have doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.</hi> They have taken away, ſhe inſtanceth none.

            </p>
            <p>It is partly to try and exerciſe our faith, and other graces, and therefore God doth ſeem to withdraw himſelf <note place="margin">Reaſons why God defers mercy.</note>in the ſence of his love.</p>

A notable paſſage there is of this, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3. 16. The ſoul ſought Chriſt, and ſought long, and ſought in the uſe of all means; but at length ſhe waited, and in waiting ſhe found him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Chriſt doth this for to ſet a greater price upon his preſence, when he comes to make his preſence highly valued, when he doth diſcover him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:170043:20"/>
in every particular of this life. And therefore God to ſet a greater price on his preſence, and that he would be held more ſtrongly, when he doth reveal himſelf, he defers a long time. That is one reaſon why he did defer revealing himſelf to <hi>Mary,</hi> that ſhe might have the more ſweet content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in him, when he did reveal him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as indeed ſhe had. Long deferring of a thing doth but inlarge the ſoule. Want inlargeth the deſire, and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the ſoul, ſo doth love. Now when we want that we love, that emptieth the ſoul marvellouſly much, it mortifieth affection. When God keeps off a long time, and we ſee it is God only muſt do it, then the affection is taken off from earthly things, and the heart inlarged to God by love, and the want of the thing we love. And therefore we ſet a price on the thing; ſo that we are wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully pleaſing to God. It is very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall to our ſelves. What loſt <hi>Mary</hi> by it? ſo ſhall we loſe nothing.

When things are kept long from us, &amp; God only muſt diſcover. When the heart is kept from ſecond cauſes, the heart is inlarged. Certainly, this comes from God, and God ſhould have all the glory of it. God is wiſe, and therefore makes us to ſtay a long time for that we do deſire.</p>

Then certainly we loſe Chriſt wonderfully, and not againſt our minds, but willingly by our own ſlighting of him, and by our own undervaluing of him, or by our negligence, and preſumption.

The Holy Ghoſt knoweth the ſecrets in the breſt of God, and in our own hearts. Now the Holy Ghoſt only can reveal the particular love that lyeth in Gods breſt, to our particular ſouls. And therefore we ſhould deſire God, that the holy ſpirit may be ſent to ſeal to us our particular ſalvation, and never be quiet till we be ſealed in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular aſſurance, that we be they, whom Chriſt came to ſave. This we ought to labour for, if we labour for it, we ſhall have it, ſometime or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for God loveth to be familiar with his Children. He loveth not to be ſtrange to them, if they ſeek his love, but to reveal himſelf firſt or laſt. And few ſeek it, but God revealeth himſelf by his ſpirit to them, before they die; if he doth not, they are ſure of it in Heaven. And therefore they that be againſt particulars, they are enemies to their own ſalvation. <hi>Mary</hi> regarded not, while Chriſt ſpake of generalls.

But ſaith he, touch me not in ſuch a manner, this is not a fit manner for thee to touch me in, now I am riſen again. In a word, ſhe had a thought to converſe with Chriſt, in as familiar a manner, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when ſhe powred oyntment on his head. He was the ſame perſon, but the caſe is altered; that was in the dayes of his humiliation, now he was <note place="margin">Senſe much affects carnal men.</note>riſen again, and it was the firſt degree of his glorification. There was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner of converſe due to him, and therefore, <hi>touch me not.</hi> Thou thinkeſt to touch me as thou didſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <note place="margin">Chriſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection is to be touched by faith, and not by ſenſe.</note>but thou muſt not do it. She was too much addicted to his bodily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. 1. It is that, that men will labour after, and have laboured for, even from the beginning of the world, to be too much addicted to preſent things, and to ſenſe. They will wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip Chriſt, but they muſt have a picture before them They will adore
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:170043:26"/>
Chriſt; but they muſt bring his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy down into a peece of bread, they muſt have a preſence. And ſo inſtead of raiſing their hearts to God and Chriſt in a heavenly manner, they pull down God and Chriſt to them; this the pride, and baſe earthlineſs of man will do. And therefore ſaith Chriſt, <hi>touch me not,</hi> in that manner; It is not with me now as it was before. <note place="margin">The Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate knoweth no man, no not Chriſt himſelf after the fleſh.</note>We muſt take heed of mean and baſe conceits of Chriſt.

Chriſt was of ſuch a Tribe, Stature, had ſuch gifts and qualities. What is that to me? Chriſt is now Lord of Lords, and King of Kings. He is glorious in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and ſo I conceive of him. I know no man after the fleſh, no, not Chriſt himſelf. I forget what he was on earth, and think of him, what he is now in Heaven. Therefore to bring him down to our baſe conceits, to ſenſe, and the like, this is the humour of men, that labour to croſſe the ſcope of the Goſpel. For why are men ſo addicted to outward things, outward
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:170043:27"/>
complements? It is pride, it is ſata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall pride; they think that God is delighted with whatſoever their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is delighted withall. Becauſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt <note place="margin">Joh. 4. 24.</note>men, there muſt be a deal a doing: therefore they think God is well pleaſed with ſuch things. God is a ſpitit, and though outward things be neceſſary, yet all muſt not be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed outward, as in Popery. We muſt not bring God down to our fooliſh conceits, as if he were delighted, as we are.</p>

The Devill ſhall not take him from Chriſt, and make him one with himſelf. It is a ſtrange word in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall, Thou claſpeſt about me, thou doſt more then touch me, thou cling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to me, and wilt not leave me, as if I would go preſently to the Father; but I am not yet aſcended to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

That is one part of the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>But there is farther then that, <hi>I am not yet aſcended to the Father, touch me not.</hi> That is, it is another manner of touch that I look for, better for thee, and in ſome regard for me, to touch me by the hand of faith when I am aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended to the Father, then touch me, and take thy full of touching me. But for the preſent I am not aſcended, I have not done all.

So
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:170043:29"/>
the beſt communion with Chriſt is to believe, till we come to Heaven to have eternall communion with him. This touch will do thee little good, and it pleaſeth me as little. When I am aſcended to the Father, then touch me at the full, ſo you ſee what Chriſt meaneth.</p>
            <p>The life of a Chriſtian here, and the manner of the diſpenſation of Chriſt here, is by promiſe, and by his ſpirit that we ſhould live by faith, and not by ſenſe. The life of ſight is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for another world, when we are fitted for it. She was not fit for a life of ſenſe, but was to expect the Holy Ghoſt from Heaven, to be filled with that, and then to be filled with faith and love, and then to have an holy Communion with him in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. But I <hi>am not yet aſcended.</hi> Thus you ſee the meaning, touch me not.</p>
            <p>There be two reaſons of Chriſts prohibition. 1. Her reſpects were too carnall and ordinary, conſidering he was in the ſtate of glory. And then 2. for that there will be time enough: do not ſtand imbracing of me. There

As if he would have his own ſacrifice <note place="margin">Charity.</note>neglected, rather then we ſhould not be reconciled to others. And ſo a work of charity and love is preferred before an officium and complement to himſelf.

And all have ſome comfort in it, as their nature is digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and that he took not on him the nature of Angels, but the nature of man, his ſpouſe, his Church it is, that hath the comfort of it.

            <p>Our hearts are too narrow a great

deal to imbrace the whole comfort that this word affords unto us. That Chriſt ſhould own us as his Brother after his Reſurrection; for that ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a reconciliation. Brother is a tearm of friendſhip, nay more then a tearm of reconciliation, for a man may be reconciled to an enemy; but it is a tearm of amity, to ſhew that when we believe in Chriſt, and are one with him, our ſins are quitted, death is overcome, Satans head is cruſhed when God is reconciled. What have they to do with us? they <note place="margin">By faith in Chriſt both ſin, death and hell are overcome.</note>are only to ſerve our turns to bring us to Heaven, and fit us for it.

glory of a chriſtian. When they told our Saviour Chriſt, that his Mother and Brethren were to ſpeak with him; ſaith he, they that hear my word, and do it, they are my Brother and Siſter, and my Mother. This is the excellency of a chriſtian that he is of ſo near a kin to Chriſt.

Nay it is more, he preferreth Mother, before Mother, Brother, before Brother; ther; Mother in ſpirit, before Mother in the fleſh, and Brother in ſpirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all other Brothers. Therefore an excellent thing to be a chriſtian.</p>

            <p>Let us oppoſe this to the diſgrace of the world, and to all temptations of diſcouragement whatſoever. What

What can diſcourage a man that is thus apprehenſive of this Excellency upon good tearms.

               <hi>Go to my Brethren.</hi> When doth he bid her go? now after his Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and humility of Chriſt.</note>when he was to aſcend to Heaven.

Chriſts <note place="margin">Chriſt ſpeedy in comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note>love is a quickening love, and the fruits of it are very ſpeedy. There is more then angelicall ſwiftneſs in Chriſt, when there is need of him. God helpeth at need, in the moſt ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable time, and he knoweth the time beſt of all. He did but riſe in the morning, and the very ſame day, <hi>Go tell my Brethren:</hi> ye have <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. that Chriſt cometh leaping upon the Mountains, when he was to help his Church, he leaped over the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, as in the eight verſe. The voice of my Beloved, behold he cometh leaping upon the Mountains, skipping upon the Hills. He cometh from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Earth, from the Earth to the Grave, and now he is riſen, he is all in haſt, he maketh no ſtay, becauſe his manner of diſpatch, is, to help and comfort by the Miniſtry of others.

Anſw. Beloved, where is the fault? Is it in Chriſt? you ſtand out at ſtaves end with Chriſt, you will not imbrace comforts when they be offered, or elſe you be not ſufficiently humbled; for he is wiſe, as he is ſwift, he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth which be the beſt times.</p>
            <p>You ſee then, that Chriſt (as ſoon as ever it is fit for him) he will come. If he ſhould come ſooner, he would come too ſoon; if afterward it would <note place="margin">Chriſt takes his ow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If thou want comfort, humble ſoul, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thou art, wait his leaſure, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he knoweth the beſt time, and when the time is come, he will come.

            <p>Now as he ſent her in all haſt, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring it before any Complement to his own perſon; ſo it is a conſtant love: as it is a quick love, that God bears to his Children, ſo it is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, invincible love. They had dealt <note place="margin">Chriſts love conſtant.</note>moſt unbrotherly with him; for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one had forſaken him, and <hi>Peter</hi> had denyed him: yet <hi>go, tell my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:170043:43"/>
One would think this water would have quenched this fire, this unkind, and unbrotherly dealing would have quenched this love in Chriſts breaſt. It is true, if it had been the meer love of man, it had been ſomething; but it was the love of an infinite perſon, that took our nature out of love, and therefore it was a conſtant and invincible love; nothing could conquer it, not the thoughts of their unkind dealings, no not their denying and forſaking of him. But ſtill, <hi>go, tell my Brethren. Love is ſtrong as death.</hi> Death could not hold Chriſt in the grave, but love held him on the Croſſe. When he came to the work of our Redemption, love then held him on earth; but when he was in the grave, it brake through all there. Indeed, it was ſtronger then death in Chriſt.</p>

Beloved, let us not loſe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the conſtancy and immutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Chriſts love. Let us conceive that all the ſweet links of ſalvation are held on Gods part ſtrong, not on ours, the firmneſs is on Gods part, not <note place="margin">The links of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hold firm on Gods part.</note>on ours. Election is firm on Gods part, not on ours. We chuſe indeed as he chuſeth us; but the firmneſs is of his chuſing: ſo he calleth us, we anſwer; but the firmneſs is of his action. He juſtifieth, we are made righteous, but the firmneſs is of his imputation. Will he forgive ſins to day, and bring us into Court, and damn us to morrow? no, the firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is of his action. We are ready to run into new debts every day; but whom he juſtifieth, he will glorifie. The whole chain ſo holdeth, that all the Creatures in Heaven and Earth cannot break a link of it; whom he calleth, he will juſtifie and glorifie: therefore never doubt of continuance, for it holds firm on Gods part, not thine, God imbraceth us in the arms of his everlaſting love, not that we imbraced him firſt. When the Child falleth not, it is from the Mothers holding the Child, and not from the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:170043:45"/>
Childs holding the Mother. So it is Gods holding of us, knowing of us, imbracing of us, and juſtifying of us, that maketh the ſtate firm, and not <note place="margin">Gods love <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The ſight of the Sun varieth, but the Sun in the Firmament keepeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes his conſtant courſe: ſo Gods love is as the Sun invariable, and for ever the ſame. I only touch it, as the foundation of wonderful comfort, which they undermine that hold the contrary.</p>
            <p>The next point is, that Chriſt choſe <hi>Mary</hi> to go tell his Brethren, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſweet title of Brethren, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver this ſweet meſſage, <hi>I am going to my Father and your Father, to my God, and your God.</hi> He telleth them the ſweeteſt words in the worſt times.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">In darkeſt times Chriſt is near to comfort.</note> This point differeth from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer thus. The former was, that Chriſts love is conſtant, and alwayes the ſame; but now Chriſt moſt ſheweth his love when we are moſt caſt down, in the worſt times, if our caſting down be with repentance. He never ſaid <hi>Brethren</hi> before, but reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the tearm of <hi>Brethren</hi> for the

The poor Diſciples were not only in affliction, being the ſcorn of the world, the Shepheard being ſmitten, and the ſheep ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but their inward grief was greater, they were inwardly confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and aſhamed to ſee Chriſt come to ſuch an end, they were full of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, though Chriſt had told them, he would riſe again, they could not believe; and ſo what with fear, and what with doubt, and what with grief for their uſing of Chriſt ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly, and leaving him, certainly they were in a perplexed and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate condition: yet now, <hi>go and</hi>

And it was in his mind, it was certainly ſo to be; and therefore he ſpeaks of it in preſent. It is the phraſe of faith, to ſpeak of things to come, as if they were preſent, faith makes them ſo to the ſoul; for it looketh on the word, and all things, as they are in that word, who will make good whatſoever he ſaith. And therefore it is the evidence of things that are not yet, yet they be evident to a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſoul. If we could learn this aright to make things to come preſent, what kind of people ſhould we be? could we think of our Reſurrection and aſcenſion, and glory to come, as preſent, they would be preſent to our faith: the things preſent, or ſenſe, could not withdraw us. If we could ſet Hell before us, could the pleaſures of Hell bewitch us? if the time to come were preſent, could any thing in the world withdraw us? it could

               <note place="margin">Saints look for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as Chriſt did.</note> He <hi>aſcendeth,</hi> he implyeth, that he was riſen, that was paſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he nameth it not. All Chriſts mind was on aſcending. Thoſe that are riſen together with Chriſt, their mind is all on aſcenſion, all on Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. And this is one main reaſon, becauſe where any thing is imperfect, there the ſpirit reſteth not, till it at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to that perfection, that it is deſtinated unto. When any thing hath a proper element and place, where it muſt reſt, it reſteth not till it be in its proper place and Element. The perfection of the ſoul is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to ſee Chriſt face to face, and God in Chriſt. Heaven is the Element of a Chriſtian, it is his proper Region, he is never well till there, and there is his reſt, his ſolace and contentment, <note place="margin">Till we come to Heaven, our deſires are unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied.</note>and there all his deſires are ſatiated to the utmoſt. Till we be in Heaven, we be under deſires; for we be under imperfections. All the while we are in imperfections, we are in an uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable eſtate, and while we be ſo,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:170043:52"/>
we are not as we would be. And therefore whereſoever any are parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of Chriſts Reſurrection, they mind the aſcenſion as preſent. Where any grace is, there the thoughts are for Heaven preſently.</p>
            <p>Let us take a ſcantling of our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions from hence. There be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that think it good to be here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, they never think of aſcending. If they could live here alwayes, they would with all their heart; but it is not ſo with a Chriſtian, it is his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be where his happineſs, his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, his God, and Father is, where his Country and inheritance is; and therefore he mindeth aſcenſion, and things to come. When any thing is done, he thinks, that what is done, is not yet enough. <note place="margin">Simile.</note>As your great Conquerours in the world, they forget what they have conquered, and remember what they have yet to do. So Chriſt, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving got conqueſt over death, he thinks now of aſcenſion, to conquer in the eyes of all; for it is not enough to conquer in the field, but he will conquer in the City, he will conquer

               <hi>Reſol.</hi> Partly, we may know it by our former courſes. Chriſt, when he was riſen, all the Clothes were laid together in the grave, he left him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, and roſe with an Earth-quake, there was a commotion, and after his Reſurrection he minded Heaven. So if ye be riſen with Chriſt, your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer vile courſes lie in the grave, your Oaths are gone, prophaneſs and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of life gone. Tell you me, you are riſen, while you carry the bonds of your ſins about you? your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:170043:53"/>
wretched, ſwearing, ungodly perſons, filthy ſpeakers, that have an heart more filthy, vile in body and ſoul, can they have any part in Chriſt? where is that, that bound you before, you carry it about ſtill: therefore you be in the bonds of the Devill, you be in the grave of ſin, there is no ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. Reſurrection is with commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there was an Earth-quake when Chriſt aroſe, and there is an heart-quake when the ſoul riſeth; can the ſoul riſe from ſin without commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? In the inward man there will be diviſion between fleſh and ſpirit, without any adoe at all; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they that find nothing to do in their ſpirits, where is their riſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain?</p>
            <p>But that which is proper to the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion in hand, is the third, where grace is begun, there will be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward proceeding and aſcending with Chriſt. How ſhall I know therefore whether I aſcend?</p>
            <p>Firſt, by minding things above, the Apoſtle telleth us directly, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 1. Mind things above, be heavenly minded in ſome ſort, live the life that
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:170043:54"/>
Chriſt did, after his Reſurrection; all his diſcourſe was, after his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Kingdom of Heaven, and his mind was on the place, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Heavenly minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note>he was to go, and ſo a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian indeed, that is truly riſen, his thoughts and diſcourſe is, (when he is himſelf) heavenly. Other things he uſeth as if he did not, as while we be in the world, we muſt deal with worldly things; but we muſt deal with them, as that which is not our proper Element, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 37. <hi>They uſed the world as if they uſed it not; and they married, as if they did not; for they knew the faſhion of this world paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth away.</hi> And therefore they that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect earthly glory, carnal affections and delights, they cannot think of theſe things with any comfort. They be moles which grovel in the Earth. Some make a profeſſion, and they <hi>aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend higher as Kites do;</hi> but they <hi>look lowe:</hi> they make high profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but their aims are low. The true <hi>Eagles</hi> that aſcend to Chriſt, as they aſcend, ſo they look upward, and upward ſtill; they do not mind things below, they do not take a high
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:170043:54"/>
pitch, and ſtill continued arthly mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but they look high, as well as aſcend high: therefore let us not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our ſelves.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Yet more particularly, thoſe that aſcend with Chriſt, they that are in Heaven, and they that are on earth do the ſame things, though in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent degrees and meaſure. What do they in Heaven? there they meddle <note place="margin">Converſe with the world, be not defiled with the world.</note>not with defilements of the world, and ſo though a Chriſtian be on earth, he defileth himſelf not with the world, or ill Company. He will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with them, but not defile him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with them. They that be in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, are prayſing of God, and ſo be they much in prayſing of God here. They that be in Heaven, love to ſee the face of God, they joy in it. And they that be heavenly-minded here, joy in the preſence of God, in the world, the Sacraments and his Children. If they be aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in any degree and meaſure, this they will do. And then they will joy in communion with God, all they can, as they do in Heaven: you have ſome carnal diſpoſitions, that are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver themſelves, but in carnal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:170043:55"/>
like themſelves. If ever we mean <note place="margin">Heaven injoyed on earth.</note>to be in Heaven, we muſt joy in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, on Earth, that is, in them that be heavenly in their diſpoſitions. If we cannot indure them here, how ſhall we ever live with them in Heaven?</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Quaere.</note> What was Chriſt to aſcend for? what is the end of his aſcenſion?</p>
            <p>The end of his aſcenſion was to <note place="margin">Reaſons of Chriſts aſcenſion.</note>take poſſeſſion of Heaven in his body, which had never been there before.</p>
            <p n="1">1. And he was to take poſſeſſion of Heaven in his body, for his Church, that is, his myſtical body. So he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended to Heaven, carried his bleſſed body (that he took in the Virgins womb with him.)</p>
            <p n="2">2. And likewiſe he aſcended to Heaven, to take up Heaven in behalf of his Spouſe, his Church, as the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band takes up Land in another Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, in behalf of his Wife: therefore he did aſcend.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And likewiſe he aſcended to leave us his ſpirit, that he might ſend the Comforter. He taketh away himſelf that was the great Comforter, while he was below. He was the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom, and while the Bride-groom
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:170043:55"/>
was preſent, they had not ſuch a meaſure of the ſpirit, Chriſts pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence ſupplyed all; but Chriſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended to Heaven, that his departure from them, might not be prejudicial to them; but that they might have comfort through the God of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, the ſpirit of comfort, the Holy Ghoſt. <hi>I will ſend the Comforter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though there was no loſſe by the aſcenſion of Chriſt, they might fear by loſing of Chriſt, that all their comfort was gone. I, but Chriſt tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them, <hi>I go to prepare a place for you.</hi> He goeth to take up Heaven for his Church, and then to ſend his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. What a bleſſed intercourſe is there now, ſince Chriſts aſcenſion, between Heaven and Earth? Our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is in heaven, and the ſpirit of God is here on earth. The fleſh that he hath taken into heaven, is a pledge that all our fleſh and bodies, ſhall be where he is ere long. In the mean time we have the ſpirit to comfort us, and never to leave us till we be brought to the place where Chriſt is. This is great comfort, and this is the main end why Chriſt aſcended to the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:170043:56"/>
Father, that he might ſend the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter. And comfort might well come now in more abundance, then before, becauſe by the death of Chriſt all enemies were conquered, and by <note place="margin">Our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, and God appeaſed by Chriſts reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note>the Reſurrection of Chriſt, it was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, that God was appeaſed. The Reſurrection of Chriſt manifeſted to the world what was done by death, and now all enemies being conquered, and God being appeaſed, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains but the ſweeteſt gift next Chriſt, the Holy Ghoſt. And that is the reaſon why the holy Ghoſt was more abundant after Chriſts Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, becauſe God was fully ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; and declared by the riſing of Chriſt, to be fully ſatisfied, and all enemies to be conquered.</p>
            <p n="4">4. One end likewiſe of his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection was, <hi>to make a ſhew of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt.</hi> There is a double victory over the Enemy.

And then there is triumphing <hi>in Civitate Regia,</hi> a triumphing in the Kingly City. So Chriſt did conquer in his death, and ſhewed his Conqueſt by reſurrection; but he did not lead
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:170043:56"/>
captivity captive, and make ſhew thereof till he aſcended, and then he made open ſhew of his victorious tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph <hi>in Civitate Regia.</hi>

One ſpecial end likewiſe why he would have this Meſſage ſent, that he was to aſcend, was that he might appear there in Heaven for us, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. <hi>He appears for ever in Heaven for us, and maketh interceſſion for us.</hi> When the high Prieſt was to enter into the holy of holies, (which was a type of Heaven) he carried the names of the twelve Tribes ingraven in ſtones up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his breſt. Chriſt our true high Prieſt being entred into the true Holy of Holies, carried the names of all his Elect in his breaſt into Heaven, and there appeareth before God for us. He carrieth us in his heart. Chriſt doth fulfill that which in <hi>John</hi> 17. he prayeth for; appearing in heaven <note place="margin">Chriſts blood ſpeaks mercy and pardon.</note>before his Father, by virtue of his blood-ſhed, and that blood that ſpeaketh better things then the blood of <hi>Abel,</hi> it ſpeaks mercy &amp; pardon, the blood of <hi>Abel</hi> crieth for vengeance &amp; juſtice; but the blood of Chriſt ſaith, here is one that I ſhed my blood for.
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:170043:57"/>
And when we pray to God, God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of our prayers, and by virtue of Chriſts blood-ſhed, there is mercy and pardon, and favour procured; which is ſprinkled by faith upon the ſoul, God manifeſting to the ſoul by his ſpirit, that Chriſt dyed in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular for ſuch a ſoul; which ſoul praying to God in the name of Chriſt, that blood not only in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but ſprinkled upon the ſoul, ſpeaketh peace there.

As Chriſt in Heaven appears, and intercedeth for me, ſo the ſpirit intercedeth in mine own guilty heart, that always ſpeaks diſcomfort, till it be ſatisfied with particular aſſurance. Chriſt dyed for me, and God is mine, and Chriſt is mine. Thus particular faith ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the blood of Chriſt upon the ſoul. So that now my ſins are not only pardoned in Heaven, but in my ſoul. There is not only interceſſion
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:170043:57"/>
in Heaven, but in my ſoul. My ſoul goeth to God for pardon and for mercy, and rejoyceth in all the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies it hath, and hopeth to have. What is done in Heaven, is done in a mans ſoul by the ſpirit in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>

I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, I ſhall be damned, ſaith the guilty heart; till the ſpirit of God hath brought it under, and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it of Gods love in Chriſt. Say not, <hi>who ſhall aſcend up to Heaven? for that is to bring Chriſt down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>

And what an injurious thing is <note place="margin">Rom. 10, 6. 7.</note>it to bring Chriſt from heaven, to ſuffer on the Croſſe. This is a great indignity, though we think not of it, to doubt of our ſalvation, and not caſt our ſelves on his mercy? For as verily as he is there, we ſhall be there. He is gone to take up a place for us; he is there in our name, as the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band taketh a place for his ſpouſe. And if we doubt whether we ſhall come there, or no, we doubt whether he be there, or no. And if we doubt of that, we doubt whether he hath wrought ſalvation, or no; and ſo we bring him down to the Croſſe again. Who ſhall deſcend to the deep? that is, to bring Chriſt from the dead a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: ſuch is the danger of a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſtful heart. So that by Chriſts aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending into Heaven, we may know all is done and accompliſhed, all our enemies are ſubdued, God is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed and fully ſatisfied, Heaven is taken up in our room, and therefore labor for a large heart anſwerable to the large unchangeable grounds we have, for faith to pitch and bottom it ſelf upon.</p>

               <note place="margin">Think on Chriſt as aſcended with him.</note> but if we would have the comfort of it, we muſt think of it, as our ſelves aſcending with him.

And ſo God before e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver we were born provided a place, and paradiſe for us in Heaven, that we might end our dayes with greater comfort. We may be ſtreightned here, many a good Chriſtian hath ſcarce where to lay his head; but Chriſt is gone to prepare a place for them in Heaven. And this may comfort us in the conſideration of all our ſins; for ſin paſt, and for corruption preſent, and for any ſin that we may commit for time to come; for any thing that is paſt, if we confeſſe our ſins to God, he will forgive them: the blood of Chriſt cleanſeth us from all ſins, even for the preſent corruptions that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend on us. We have one that ſtands between God and us as a ſurety, &amp; he will give us his ſpirit to ſubdue our
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:170043:63"/>
corruptions, and at length make us <note place="margin">Epheſ. 5. 20.</note>like himſelf, a glorious ſpouſe. If we were perfect men, we needed not a Mediator, and this may teach us com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, rather becauſe we are ſinners, and daily ſubject to offend God. We have one to make our peace; for time to come, if we ſin, we have an <note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 1. Mat. 6. 12.</note>Advocate. When Chriſt taught us to pray, forgive us our daily tueſpaſſes, he ſuppoſed we would daily run into ſins. We have an Advocate in Heaven every day to ſtand between God and us, to anſwer God, to undertake that at length we ſhould ceaſe to offend him, and for the preſent, we are ſuch as he ſhed his pretious blood for, and he appeareth for us by vertue of his death, which is a marvellous comfort. We think if we commit ſin, there is no hope; but what needs a Mediator, but to make peace between the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties diſagreeing? If all things were made up between God and us, what need of an interceſſor? but God know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth well enough, we run into daily ſins, by reaſon of a ſpring of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in us, which is never idle.

            <p>There is not a Chriſtian but will be in himſelf apprehenſive of being thrown into Hell every day. There is a ſpring of corruption in him, and ſhould God take a forfeiture of his daily rebellions, his conſcience tells him, it were juſt. And therefore we muſt every day live upon this branch of his prieſtly office, his mediation. We muſt live by faith in this branch <note place="margin">To rely on Chriſt is to feed upon him.</note>of Chriſt, and make uſe of it continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally; for this will keep us from hell. And therefore if we ſin every day, go to God, in the name of Chriſt, and deſire him to pardon us. This is to feed on Chriſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhould more willingly come to the Sacrament. When we be in heaven, we ſhall need a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor no longer; for we ſhall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly holy. We cannot think of theſe things too much, they be the life of Religion, and of comforts, and it may teach us to make a true uſe of Chriſt in all our conditions. Poor

ſouls that are not acquainted with the Goſpel, they think God will caſt them into hell for every ſin, and they live as if they had not an high Prieſt in Heaven to appear for them.</p>
            <p>The matter of the meſſage is, Chriſt aſcendeth to God, as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Father, and God to him and them. He doth not ſay, I aſcend to <note place="margin">God is firſt Chriſts God and Father, and then our God &amp; Father.</note>the Father, that were no great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; for what were that to them? or to my Father only: neither doth he ſay, I aſcend to our Father, for that is true in the order of it; for he is not in equal reſpect the God and Father of Chriſt, and the God and Father of us. And therefore he ſpeaks of himſelf in the firſt place. <hi>I go to my God and your God.</hi> For he is firſt, and ſpecially Chriſts Father, and Chriſts God, and then ours; as we ſhall ſee in the particulars. We have a common Father, and a common God, with Chriſt. God the Father is Chriſts Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by eternal generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as he is God and man: we have therefore the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <note place="margin">How God is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Chriſt.</note>of Chriſt, ashe is God and man.</p>
            <p>There is this difference between Gods being Chriſts Father, and the Father of any elſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:170043:65"/>
Firſt of all, God is Chriſts Father from eternity, God had a being, and was a Father from all eternity. There is no man of equal ſtanding with his Father, he is born after his Father cometh to be a man; but Chriſt is of God from all eternity, his generation is eternall, and therefore there is a grand difference.</p>
            <p>Then Chriſt is coequal with the <note place="margin">Chriſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal with his Father.</note>Father in glory and majeſty every way. The Sun is not coequal with the Father, but Chriſt is with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Again, the Son in other Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons comes of the Father, and is like the Father, taken out of his ſubſtance, but of a different ſubſtance from the Father; but Chriſt and the Father, both the perſons are in one ſubſtance, in one eſſence. The eſſence of the Father differeth not from the eſſence of the Son. We muſt remember this to give Chriſt the prerogative, and preheminency, that God is his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in another manner then ours. He is his Father by nature, ours by adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. What he is by nature, we are by grace: though Chriſt was intent
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:170043:65"/>
upon his aſcenſion, yet he forgetteth not this grand differrnce here, but mentioneth it. <hi>Go to my Brethren.</hi> We muſt not call him brother again, we may think of him as our Brother; but <hi>my God and my Lord,</hi> as <hi>Thomas</hi> ſaith. <note place="margin">Joh. 20. 28</note>If the greateſt perſon ſhould call us Brother, yet it is moſt behoveful for the inferior to ſay, <hi>my God, my Lord,</hi> to acknowledge Chriſt as a great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and to make uſe of his love to ſtrengthen our faith, not to diminiſh our reſpect to him in any way. It is his infinite mercy to tearm us Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; but when we go to him, we muſt have other tearms.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee how to conceive of Chriſt after his Reſurrection. When he hath triumphed over all his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and reconciled God by his death, then <hi>I go to my Father, and your Father.</hi> Then he is a common Father by virtue of Chriſts ſatisfaction to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine wrath and juſtice, and victory and triumphing over all his enemies. So we muſt not conceive of God as our Father; but in reference to Chriſts victory over death. God is our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by vertue of Chriſts ſatisfaction
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:170043:66"/>
to juſtice, and conqueſt over all our enemies. <hi>The God of peace,</hi> (ſaith the holy Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> in the concluſion of that excellent Epiſtle,) <hi>that brought you from death to life through our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</hi> How cometh he to be the God of peace to us, which brought us from death to life, by our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus? why? the Reſurrection of Chriſt makes him the God of peace. Who raiſed him? He raiſed himſelf. But who together with himſelf? The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther raiſed him. And could the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther raiſe him, if he were not reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led? But now he is the God of peace; <note place="margin">1 Col. 20.</note>for peace is made by the Croſſe and blood of Chriſt, the great peace-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of heaven and earth; now we may conceive of God under the ſweet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of a Father.</p>
            <p>Now this Relation of a Father teacheth us, as what we may expect from God, ſo what we ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to God again, and how we ought to carry our ſelves one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p n="1">

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:170043:66"/>
a Child may expect from a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. God taketh not upon him emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty names. He ſaith, he will be a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not only called a Father; <hi>but I will be your Father,</hi> and you ſhall be <note place="margin">All com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is from God reconciled to us in Chriſt.</note>my Sonnes, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. <hi>ult.</hi> All the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood, and all the kindred in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth, that is ſpiritual: the comfort of it cometh from God the Father, reconciled to us in Chriſt. The word in the original is ſo ſtrong, that we cannot expreſs it in <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Fathers on earth are but poor Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and they be but beams of the Fatherly affection that is in God.

The true reality of Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood is in God. And therefore when we hear of the name of Father, think of whatſoever lieth in the bowels of a Father to a Child, and that we may expect from God our Father, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite more. It is a great indulgence; <note place="margin">Mal. 3. 17.</note>as a Father pittieth his Child, <hi>Malac.</hi> 3. ſo God will pitty us. Will a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſt off his Child?

               <note place="margin">Father is a tearm of indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</note> take away our abominations, and purge us when we defile our ſelves: it is becauſe of an eternal relation he caſteth us not off; we may expect from him indulgence, and it is an indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of indulgence. God needed no Sonne, when he made us Sonnes; yet he had his Sonne, and angels to praiſe himſelf withall. Can we pitty and pardon a Child, and will not God pardon and pitty us? why ſhould we conceive worſe of him then of our ſelves? will we give pitty to a Father? and not pitty to the Father of all bowels and compaſſion? and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore think not that God will caſt us off. God pardons us, and healeth our infirmities, and pittieth us, as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pittieth his own Child, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. It is a name under which no man muſt deſpair. What? deſpair under the name of a Father? deſpair of mercy when we have a Father to go to? The poor prodigal when he had ſpent his patrimony, his body, his good name, had loſt all, and nothing <note place="margin">Luk. 15. 18</note>left, yet he had a Father, and <hi>I will go to him.</hi> And ſo when we be at the laſt caſt, and have ſpent all, we have a

So that it is a name of indulgence.</p>
            <p>You have his diſpoſition ſet down by the Father of the prodigal.

will give us grace to ſanctifie his name, and do his will, and forgive us our ſins. Expect all from our Father, which is the ground of all.

We are to honour him as our Father. This one word is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to expreſſe our duty to a Father, and that is a word of reverence; for it includeth a mixt affection of fear and love. And it is an affection of an inferior to a ſuperior. He is great, <note place="margin">Fear God for his greatneſs, love him for his goodneſs.</note>therefore we ought to fear him. He is good, therefore we ought to love him. There is with him beams of Majeſty, and bowels of compaſſion. As there is beams of Majeſty, we ought to fear him as bowels of compaſſion, we ought to love him, ſo that fear and love mixt together, is the affection we owe to God, as our Father. If we tremble, and are afraid to go to him, we know not he is loving. If we go to him over boldly, and ſawcily, we forget that he is great: therefore we muſt think of his greatneſs, that we forget not his goodneſs. We muſt ſo think of his goodneſs, that we forget
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:170043:69"/>
not his greatneſs: therefore go bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to him, with reverence to the Throne of Chriſt. In the word <hi>Father,</hi> there is more ſaving power then in ten thouſand, it toucheth his very bowels, when a Child wanteth any thing, and is in diſtreſs, let it but ſay, Father, or Mother, and the bowels of the Parents yearn upon him. If God be our Father, go to him boldly; but with reverence, go with affyance to his bowels. Oh it is a <hi>perſwaſive word.</hi> What cannot we look for from that Majeſty, that hath condeſcended to be called <hi>Father,</hi> and to be a <hi>Father</hi> to us in all our neceſſities? either we ſhall have what we want and lack, or elſe we ſhall have that which is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; he is a wiſe Father, he anſwereth not alwayes according to our wills, but alwayes according to our good.

            <p>Come to him boldly therefore, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of a Father, that he may move his bowels, and ſurely will hear us.

He was our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before we had a Father in the world; and he will be our Father, when we ſhall ceaſe to be in the world. They be but Inſtruments un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God, to bring us into the world, God is our true Father. Our other Fathers are but under God, to give us a being, to fit us for Heaven. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videth the beſt inheritance and pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity for us in Heaven. And therefore <note place="margin">God keeps the beſt things till the laſt.</note>never be diſconſolate, but remember, <hi>I go to my Father, and your Father;</hi> which is a word of eternal comfort.

               <hi>yet can I not forget thee, thou art writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the palm of my hand. God</hi> hath us alwayes in his eye.

               <hi>The Keeper of Iſrael neither ſlumbereth nor ſleepeth.</hi> And this is our comfort in all times, and for eternity. And therefore we ought to carry our ſelves to <hi>God</hi> reverently, and go bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to him, and alwayes make uſe of him.</p>
            <p>And this we ſhould learn likewiſe to maintain a ſweet frame between <hi>God</hi> and us; ſhall <hi>God</hi> open ſuch an advantage to us? ſhall <hi>God</hi> be our <note place="margin">Faith and prayer fetcheth all from God.</note>

And therefore be incouraged to make intercourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thee and God; conſidering we have a Brother in Heaven, our nature is there, and our ſpirit is below, we have the beſt things in Heaven, next Chriſt, on earth, and God hath our fleſh in Heaven, by Chriſt; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore why ſhould we not be much in prayer, and much in prayſes in all our neceſſities.

God is a Father, and of the mercies of God, though they do not ſee they be intereſted in them.

               </hi> as a Father.</p>
            <p>I deſire you therefore to remember this, it is the firſt Sermon of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſt, after his Reſurrection, and therefore forget not to think of <hi>God</hi> as a Father, and Chriſt as a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Indeed whatſoever comfort is in any relation, <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> have taken it on them. A Father is more comprehenſive then any other Title, <hi>Chriſt</hi> is <hi>Father,</hi> and <hi>Husband,</hi> and <hi>Spouſe.</hi> And <hi>God</hi> is our <hi>Rock</hi> and <hi>Shield,</hi> and whatſoever is comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, he hath taken on him; and in Chriſt we may command him to be ſo. And if we had ten thouſand Worlds, they could not be compared to the comforts that ariſe from hence, that we can call <hi>God</hi> Father. It is more to us, if we could improve it in our ſpiritual Trade for Heaven, then
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:170043:74"/>
if we had a thouſand worlds, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in dayes of affliction, and in the hour of death.

When no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe will comfort, this will comfort, if we can ſay to <hi>God,</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Though we cannot make a diſtinct prayer, yet if we can ſay, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>God</hi> can pick matter out of our broken Language. Now Chriſt is aſcended up to Heaven, he doth us more good then he did, when he was <note place="margin">Simile.</note>upon the earth. The Sun in the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament yieldeth us heat and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; but if it were nearer, it would do us hurt, or if further off, it would not do us ſo much good. God hath placed it (being a common light of the world) high, to inlighten inferior bodies, and to convey influence by means into them. And ſo Chriſt the Son of righteouſneſs being aſcended, and advanced to Heaven, doth more good then on earth. And therefore ſaith he, <hi>it is for your good that I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend.</hi> It is for our good that we have Chriſt in Heaven to appear there for us.</p>

Chriſt might well ſay, <hi>I aſcend to my Father</hi> now; for he was riſen again, and was mightily declared to be the Son of God, by his Reſurrection from the dead. <hi>Thou art my Son, this day</hi>

And he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth our love to him, which is in ſome meaſure.

It is an eternal relation. <hi>Dum percutis pater es, Dum Caſtigas, pater es,</hi> ſaith <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> while thou ſtrikeſt us, thou art our Father, whilſt thou correcteſt us, thou art our Father.

            </p>
            <p>But if this be ſo, let us learn of <hi>God</hi> to be indulgent. If it were to ſpeak to <note place="margin">The Law neceſſary to be teached.</note>Miniſters, I ſhould be large to adviſe them to preach the Law and the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. The very Law is preached in mercy. The Lord taketh a ſevere courſe; but it is to order us. All <hi>Gods</hi> ſeverity is reducible to mercy, and Chriſt: all his afflictions, humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and abaſements, do they come from unfatherly affection? no; but
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:170043:78"/>
to draw us home to him. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore never be terrible to any; but with a bowel of compaſſion, but with a mind that they may ſee themſelves, and ſee the comforts they have in Chriſt: We ought to be of his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the great <hi>Paſtor</hi> and <hi>Biſhop of the Church.</hi> And ſo for ordinary Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, they ſhould be indulgent one to another. Some are alwayes cutting in Ulcers, always wounding and tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves with ill uſage, and miſconſtruction, keeping themſelves from growing up in a better life, by obſerving the infirmities of them that be better then themſelves. Oh, <hi>but go tell my Brethren,</hi> that my Father own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them for his Children, which may be a uſe of marvellous comfort to us.</p>
            <p>Shall a Child be always prowling <note place="margin">Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in all condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be laboured for.</note>for it ſelf? we think there is neither Father nor Mother, to take care for it, your heavenly Father knoweth what you need. We ought to labor for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in all conditions; for <hi>God</hi> is our Father. And for others, if <hi>God</hi> be our Father, let us look to others, that be our brethren, own them, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry our ſelves to them as brethren. Let the ſtrong carythe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves lowly to the

Many account it great commendations on their part to be cenſorious, and to be ſevere; I but that is the greateſt part of their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, if they have any goodneſs in them. For who was more indulgent to the Diſciples then Chriſt, who ſaw their weakneſs? He bore with all their infirmities. Where we ſee any goodneſs, let us bear with many weakneſſes, we ought to be peaceable men, <hi>Beati ſunt pacifici,</hi> they that be appeaſed in their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, in ſenſe of their own pardon, are ready to ſhew mercy to others.

            <p>If God be a Father, and we are Brethren, it is a levelling word, it bringeth Mountains down, and filleth up vallies.

            <p>If I were to ſpeak to perſons of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and great parts, as I am to ſpeak to mean, let them be put in mind of their condition. Nothing ſhould raiſe us up ſo high, as to forget the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting relation of Brother. Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity ſhould not ſo far prevail with us, as to forget that which the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God have to eternity. And for other perſons more eminent, if he be a King, let him not ſo mind that, as to forget all other. For all relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons determine in death, and muſt be laid in the duſt: all muſt ſtand on equal ground before Gods Barre, and they that have moſt to anſwer for, have the higheſt accompt of all: and therefore it is ground of humility to all. Let them that are in greateſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency conſider this; <hi>Paul</hi> after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 16.</note>could ſay, <hi>henceforth know I no man after the fleſh.</hi> There is a great deal of humanity in the World, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement is very ordinary, which is the Picture and out-ſide of humanity; but Chriſtian love, which is, a degree above humanity: the Apoſtle calleth

               </gap> brotherly love, that is the ſcorn of the world. They will own a Brother in office; but owning them in the ſweet bonds of Brotherhood, as they are the Sons of God, here is Heaven, make much of them in that kind, that is a ſtrange thing in the world; but we muſt know what it meaneth, before we come to Heaven, we muſt reſpect a Chriſtian, be he what he will be, under all his infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, if he hath a good ſpirit in him, which God the Father ſeeth, and Chriſt ſeeth. We muſt bear love to all Saints. Some will make much of an eminent man, that hath excellent parts, becauſe there may be ſome countenance from ſuch perſons; but here is ſincerity that beareth love to <note place="margin">Love to the Saints the higheſt mark of ſincerity.</note>all Saints. He wraps them up all in the general tearm, <hi>Go tell Peter,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt, that hath offended, more then the reſt.</p>
            <p>If you will know whether you be true Brethren or no, or Sons of God, or no; make a uſe of tryal, by what is formerly delivered. I ſhall inlarge my ſelf in that point, becauſe all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth upon it. God is the Father
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:170043:80"/>
of all by creation; he is the Father in a general Covenant, of all that receive the Sacrament, and are baptized. But if they have no other relation to God but ſo, they may go to Hell, as <hi>Judas</hi> and others did: therefore we<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> muſt know whether we may claim this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Father, on good grounds or no, elſe it is an uſurpation.</p>

               <note place="margin">Notes of adoption.</note> 1. Thoſe that belong to God, the ſpirit of God witneſſeth to them, that they are Sons. They that are adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, have the ſpirit of adoption in ſome degree, God ſendeth his ſpirit into their hearts, that aſſures them, that they be Gods Children. And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever this is the firſt, yet God giveth ſome intimation by his ſpirit, that they look to God in another familiar manner then before, and he looks on them in a Fatherly manner, ſo there be ſome intimations, and inſinuations, and hints, though the ſpirit of adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion witneſſeth not fully, and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to the ſoul always, becauſe we are not fitted for it; but ſometimes in great afflictions, and deſertions. Where the ſpirit of God is, there is Communion with God in the ſpirit
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:170043:80"/>
of adoption. And when the voice of the ſpirit of adoption ſpeaks not lowdly, yet there is a work of the ſpirit: there is ſomething in us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed by the ſpirit, there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the new Creature. When a Chriſtian cannot hear God ſay to his ſoul, I am thy ſalvation, yet a man may ſee a work of grace: there is a love to God, to the Ordinances, to the people of God, a mourning becauſe <note place="margin">God may be our God, though we cannot alwayes, make it</note>he cannot mourn, a ſighing, becauſe he hath not an heart plyable. He is diſcordant with his condition, when he is diſconſolate, ſo that there is a work of the ſpirit helpeth him in his worſt condition.</p>
            <p>Beſides, there is a ſpirit of ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in ſome meaſure, though he cannot make ſet diſcourſes to God, yet he can in a ſweet manner lay o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen his ſorrow and grief to God, and leave them in his boſom. They be broken words perhaps; but God can pluck ſenſe out of them. God know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the meaning of the ſighing of his own ſpirit, though broken ſpeeches. So that where there is any tongue for God in a man, there is a ſpirit of
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:170043:81"/>
prayer, there is not a ſtrangeneſs of God to go altogether by; but the ſpirit hath a kind of acquaintance with God, and it goeth to God in a familiarity, and layeth forth grief, and putteth forth Petitions, in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner then the World doth.</p>
            <p>Again, a Chriſtian in the worſt condition; God not only ſhineth on him through the Cloud, but there is a ſpirit in him that ſigheth, to go through all thick Clouds to God. There is a ſpirit of ſupplication, and of love in ſome degree, for that is promiſed. <hi>The ſpirit ſhall help our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, when we know not how to pray:</hi> the intercourſe and Communion <note place="margin">Even ſighs &amp; groans pierce through thick Clouds get to God.</note>with <hi>God</hi> is never broken off, where there is any ſpirit of adoption. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Jonas</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and the reſt, though they could not pray, yet they ſighed to <hi>God,</hi> and would not leave him. If they could not imbrace Chriſt, they would touch the hem of his garment. They will not yield to the ſtream altogether, but ſtrive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. And though they be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away with the ſtrength of the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:170043:81"/>
ſtream, and ſee no goodneſs in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yet they that be with them, ſhall ſee a ſpirit ſtriving to another condition, then they are in. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Chriſts, ſomething of Gods ſpirit there will be in them. And take them at the worſt, they will appear better then the civil man, that thinks himſelf a glorious man, though he hath nothing, but for ſhew and faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who would be in ſuch a mans condition, without ſome brokenneſs of heart, ſome ſighs?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Likewiſe we may know it by our ſympathy and Antipathy. Our ſympathy with them that be good, and antipathy to that which is naught. There is a love of that which is good. So things, good things are connatural to a good man. There is a <note place="margin">Good things connatural to good men.</note>reliſh in good Company, and good things. As there is ſweetneſs in the beſt things, ſo there is ſomething in the Children of God, that is anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the God whom they ſerve. He is never ſo out of taſt, but he findeth his chief comfort in this thing; and he is never himſelf ſo much, as when he is converſant in theſe things,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:170043:82"/>
though in different meaſure, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more, and ſometimes leſſe. There is an inward antipathy to God in a proud carnal man, that hath not his heart ſubdued by grace, there is a contrariety to the power of that grace, which outwardly he profeſſeth, and a ſympathy with the world, and the ſpirit of the world. Take a good Chriſtian at the worſt, he is better then another at the beſt. I beſeech you therefore, examine our diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, how we ſtand affected to things of an higher nature, then the things of the world, to ſpiritual things, how we can reliſh ſpiritual things, Gods Ordinances, &amp; any thing that is holy; ſurely, if there be the life of God, and Chriſt in us, there will be a kind of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>naturalneſs, &amp; ſuitableneſs of taſte to the ſweetnes that is in holy things.</p>

            <p>This is a weighty point for direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our devotion, that we may

See God loving us; but look on it in Chriſt, who is <hi>Sedes amoris.</hi> The next thing to God, is his Son, and he loveth none, but in him. When we conſider of any ſpiritual bleſſing, ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>Bleſſed be God who hath filled us with all ſpiritual bleſſings in Chriſt.</hi> Otherwiſe we do not know <note place="margin">Epheſ. 1. 3.</note>our ſelves, nor God. Whatſoever is derived from God to us, is through Chriſt: all promiſes are his firſt, they are made to him, and to our nature in him, and they are performed for his ſake; he taketh them from God
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:170043:83"/>
the Father, and they be performed for his ſake. He is the true <hi>Aaron,</hi> we are but the skirts, the Oyl that is power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon his head, runneth down to his skirts, it runneth to the meaneſt Chriſtian; but the Oyntment of grace is firſt powred on his head. <hi>Of</hi>

               <hi>his grace we receive grace for grace, and of his fulneſs.</hi> The firſt fulneſs is God himſelf, the ſecond receptacle of all, is Chriſt, God-man, the third are we; we have it at the third hand.

            <p>And it is for our comfort that it is ſo, that Gods love is to Chriſt firſt. There is a firm foundation, when God loveth us in his Son, and we are Children in his natural Son, in whom we are adopted, then our ſtate is firm. O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

There is not the leaſt finger of Chriſt, the leaſt deſpiſed member of Chriſt; but God looketh on him with that ſweet eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal tenderneſs, with which he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon his Son, preſerving the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of the head. Oh this is a ſweet comfort, that now all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent priviledges of a Chriſtian are ſet on Chriſt, and then on us: and therefore we ſhould not loſe them; for Chriſt will loſe nothing. When the favour of a Prince is founded on his Son, whom he always loveth, the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is unalterable on the Son; and therefore the caſe is good. So Gods favour to us is fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:170043:84"/>
to do that that belongeth to us. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect all from God through Chriſt, and do all to God through Chriſt, love God in Chriſt, and Chriſt in God, our ſelves in Chriſt, and our ſelves in the love of God. Chriſt is in God, and God is in Chriſt.

It is a ſweet communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and myſterious to us. How ſweet is the communion between the ſoul and the body, the ſoule being ſo ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, and the body a peece of earth. But what is this to the myſtery of myſteries, when God takes clay and duſt into unity of his perſon, and all <note place="margin">Clay and duſt taken into unity of the perſon of God.</note>this is for this union.

He took our natures, that he might convey his Fatherly goodneſs and love, and ſpirit to us. The ſweet union of the two natures of Chriſt, is to confirm union between the Father and us, and Chriſt and us. And we

            <p>Our bleſſed Saviour fetcheth the comfort of our <hi>Father</hi> from this, that God is his Father firſt, and ſo to joyn both together, That God is our God, becauſe he is his God firſt.

Be ſure to take <hi>Benjamin</hi> with us when we go, &amp; come cloathed with the Garments of our elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and do not doubt when we come with Chriſt; for elſe we diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour Chriſt: ſhall I come in the ſweet name and mediation of my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, that hath perfected ſalvation, and not be accepted of God, when God hath ordained him for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe? If we ſtagger, and doubt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any thing at Gods hands, we wrong not only Gods bounty, but Chriſt the Mediator; carry this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all along with us, do all in him, and deſire God to pardon all for his ſake, and God will regard us.</p>

God is firſt the Father of Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is our Father, and firſt the God of Chriſt before he is our God, and that all our good is dependent upon what God is to Chriſt firſt; then doth not this follow from hence, <note place="margin">Bleſſe God for Chriſt as well as for our ſelves.</note>that we ſhould not only thank God for our ſelves; but thank God for whatſoever he hath done to Chriſt; not only comfort our ſelves in it, but let God have the glory of it.

            <p>To come to the words. Firſt Chriſt ſaith, God was his God, and our God, becauſe his God. In what <note place="margin">How God is Chriſts God.</note>ſenſe is God Chriſts God? As media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:170043:87"/>
as man, both in regard of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and in regard of his office, God is Chriſts God every way. See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. which is a Pſalm of Chriſt, <hi>David</hi> being but a type of him in it, Thou art my God from my mothers womb, and ſo God is Chriſts God in his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſon from his Mothers womb. For firſt, God was Chriſts God, when by his holy ſpirit he ſanctified him in his Mothers womb, and brought him out into the world. Let the fooliſh diſputes of Fryars, and dreams, and dotages of dunſical times go. But thou art my God from my Mothers womb.</p>
            <p>And 2. He is Chriſts God, becauſe he ſaved him from the maſſacre of the Infants. Our Saviour Chriſt makes that prayer in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. on the Croſſe, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi>

God, as Chriſt was<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>man: take Chriſt as mediator, God is the God of Chriſt; for God the Father hath by his Authority put on Chriſt whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he hath. The Father hath ſent him into the world. The Father ſealed him, the Father ſet him out as a propitiation for our ſins. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath declared him, and annoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and all theſe tearms of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, whereby the Father hath ſhewed himſelf to be Chriſts God, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in his office of Mediatorſhip. So in regard of the care of his perſon, from his Mothers womb, and for ever, and in regard of his office as Mediator, he might well ſay, <hi>I go to my God.</hi> In regard of the intimate familiarity, and acquaintance, maintained even on the Croſſe, he might ſay, <hi>my God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the comfort of it lyeth in the ſecond clauſe, That as God is the God of Chriſt, ſo he is our God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is the God of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>What is it to be a God to any? In a word to be a God, is to be all-ſufficient, to any, to be ſole-ſufficient, and to be ſelf-ſufficient.</p>
            <p>To be a God, is to be all-ſufficient for every Creature, to be all-ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:170043:88"/>
when nothing elſe can be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. And to be ſelf-ſufficient, to be ſufficient of himſelf, and therefore to reduce all back again to himſelf. Now God is a God of himſelf, for himſelf, and by himſelf. God is all-ſufficient, ſelf-ſufficient, ſole-ſufficient; and whatſoever the Creature hath, it hath it from him. There is (in a word,) in God, a ſufficiency for all good and happineſs, and an efficiency to apply that ſufficiency for the good of the Creature. And in particular to be a God to any, is to do that for a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that no Creature in the world can do but God. To make it of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, to free it from miſery, that it is beſet withall, when no other can free it, to recover it again. God is <hi>Jehovah,</hi> that hath a being of himſelf, giveth being to the Creatures, that can make the Creature of nothing, and being ſomething, can make it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>Now, if God be a God to any, he is not only to give being to us, in a certain rank of Creatures, as we are advanced above other Creatures, as to have a being, or a life of growing,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:170043:88"/>
or a life of ſenſe, or to advance us to a life of Creatures indowed with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whereby we are common in that faſhion with Angels, and underſtand God himſelf. Alas, this were a poor priviledge, if it went no farther, then to ſet us in that rank of Creatures, though a great favour. But conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us in a lapſed eſtate, it is a poor favour to leave us here. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God is ſaid to be our God now in a ſtate of grace, when he advanceth us to an higher being and life, then all this, to a life of grace here, and of <note place="margin">God our God in the ſtate of grace.</note>glory hereafter. When out of his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty and power, he reduceth all to help forward his main end, the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his in peculiar. So God is a God in peculiar of ſome that he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth out of baſe mankind. There is a world taken out of the world, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> uſeth to ſpeak. And thus he is a God not to beſtow a life of grace, and ſupernatural being here, but a glorious condition hereafter in Heaven; and to make all things ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to that, that we may ſay, <hi>all is ours, becauſe we are Chriſts, and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 22, 23.</note>
               <hi>Chriſt is Gods.</hi> So that whatſoever
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:170043:89"/>
befalleth a Chriſtian, is ſerviceable, and conducible to the main and laſt end. And that is for God to be God indeed, to make us his in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, to give us a new Creation, and a new State, better then at firſt.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace founded on Chriſt.</note> Now, what is the foundation of this, that God is our God in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace? we ſay it is founded on Chriſt, God is Chriſts God, and then our God, and that is the reaſon why Chriſt is called <hi>Emanuel,</hi> which is as much as to ſay, as it is expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>God with us.</hi> Not only becauſe when he took our nature on him, there was God and man in one perſon; but the meaning of the word is, Chriſt is <hi>Emanuel,</hi> God with us, by being God in our nature, and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying divine juſtice in our nature, hath brought God the Father, and us together into a ſweet Covenant. So that God may be our God, and our Father, notwithſtanding his juſtice; becauſe all is ſatisfied by Chriſt, who took our nature to die for us. Chriſt is <hi>Emanuel,</hi> becauſe he hath made God and us one. So that God is our God, and not only ſo, but our Father
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:170043:89"/>
in him. Thus you ſee how it cometh to paſſe, that God is our Father by Chriſt, who came to bring us again to God; as his whole office was to bring a few that had been ſingled out of mankind to God again, from whom they fell; for we all had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God in <hi>Adam,</hi> but we loſt it, and now muſt be brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to God, which muſt be done by Chriſt, God and man.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the foundation of the point, That God is Chriſts God, and God in Chriſt is our God, to do all things for us, to bring us to an happy condition here, and an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting happy condition in Heaven.</p>
            <p>We ſee here, it is brought as a ground of comfort, and ſo indeed it <note place="margin">By vertue of Chriſts reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, God is not only our Father but our God.</note>is. And we may obſerve from hence, That now by the Reſurrection of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, God is not only become a Father to us, but a God. This is a ground of many co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forts, <hi>go tell my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi> now I am riſen again, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore juſtice is ſatisfied, and now they may have lively hope of a better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition hereafter. For God is my God, that hath raiſed me up, and who will raiſe up mine too: ſo that now we
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:170043:90"/>
are copartners with Chriſt, ſharers with him in the Fatherhood of God, and God is God in common with Chriſt and us.</p>
            <p>This may well be brought as a point of comfort, if there were any comfort in the world of ſweeter effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy then this, our Saviour would have ſent it to his Diſciples. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort being his main Office, and his main end, he would have the beſt comfort after his beſt Reſurrection. And he picks this from amongſt them all. <hi>Go tell them, I go to my Father, and their Father, to my God, and their God.</hi> And therefore it is a pregnant comfort, and indeed no heart can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the comfort of it, that we have intereſt together with Chriſt in God, and with the Fatherhood of God. And both theſe the Scripture joyneth together, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 6. <hi>I will be your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and your God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">God our God in covenant with Chriſt.</note> To unfold the comforts more, God is ſaid to be our God in Covenant in Chriſt. He is the God of Chriſt, and therefore of us; becauſe he hath made himſelf over to us. A thing is ſaid to be another mans, when the Title is
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:170043:90"/>
paſt to another man. Now God hath as it were, paſt over himſelf to his believing Children, and Members of Chriſt. He hath made over him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to them to be their God, as he was the God of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> and all the <hi>Patriarks, Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles:</hi> ſo he is of every good believing Chriſtian, to the end of the world. God maketh himſelf over to be theirs, and (as the Scriptures ſtile is) he is their portion and their Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, a bleſſed portion, a bleſſed inheritance, more to us, then if all the world were ours, then if Heaven were ours, then if ten thouſand worlds were ours; for he is our God that can create millions of worlds more then this, if it were needful. <hi>Habet omnia, qui habet habentem om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</hi> He hath all things, that hath him in Covenant that hath all things. And therefore when the Scripture ſaith, <hi>I go to their God,</hi> it implyeth, I go to him, that is, all in all to them, that is larger then their hearts can be; for what heart can conceive the fulneſſe of the comforts ariſing from hence, <hi>that God is our God.</hi> Many know they
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:170043:91"/>
need comfort of ſuch a tranſcendent <note place="margin">Intereſt in God great comfort.</note>nature. The heart of man is ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſtful, ſo faithleſs, and the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is ſuch a clamorous thing, and therefore he cannot think this is too much. I beſeech you therefore, do not loſe the comfort of it, that in Chriſt God is our God; though we can ſay of nothing elſe it is ours, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps we cannot ſay, great houſes are ours, or great friends are ours, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritances ours, that is no matter, we can ſay, that is ours, which is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more then that. We can ſay, God is ours in Chriſt. Nay, being exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſay by the ſpirit of faith, that God is ours in Chriſt, all things in the world are ours. As you have it in that place of Scripture, <hi>All things are yours,</hi> why? <hi>becauſe you are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods.</hi> Whether things preſent, or things to come, <hi>Paul, Apollos, Cephas,</hi> life, death, all is <note place="margin">Even af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions &amp; Satan him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires to make us happy.</note>yours, you are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods, that is, all things muſt by a command from God, conſpire to make us happy, affliction, or Satan, or death, or trouble of conſcience, or deſertion, or every thing to help us to
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:170043:91"/>
Heaven. The curſe is taken away, and there is a bleſſing hid in every thing that befalleth a Chriſtian, to bring him to Heaven: therefore it is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of infinite extent. All is yours, becauſe God is yours.</p>
            <p>You ſhall ſee the extent of the comforts further by retail, as it were. If God be ours, then all is ours too; what be they? the Scripture telleth you, and I ſhould ſpend too much time in unfolding of them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If God be ours, his wiſdom muſt needs be ours, to find out wayes to do us good; for his infinite wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom hath found out a way in Chriſt by ſatisfaction of his juſtice to bring us to Heaven. He can make us go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all the policy of our Neighbors; for his wiſdom is ours.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If we be in danger, his power is ours, to bring us out.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If we have ſinned, his mercy is ours to forgive us. He himſelf being ours, his mercy muſt needs be ours. The whole being ours, it followeth out of the ſtrength of reaſon, that the parts alſo muſt be ours.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In any want, his allſufficiency is
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:170043:92"/>
ours, to ſupply it, or to turn it to good, and make it up in a better kind.</p>
            <p n="5">5. In a word, God being ours, whatſoever is in God, whatſoever God can do, whatſoever he hath is ours, becauſe himſelf is ours. And therefore I beſeech you, make this uſe of it, to get into Chriſt by faith, to be one with Chriſt, that ſo God may be our God. Get faith above all graces, the grace of union, and the grace of communion, that being one with Chriſt, we are one with him. God being ours, all is ours, yea the worſt thing in the world is ours.</p>
            <p>If God be not ours, it is no matter what elſe is ours. Alas, all things muſt be taken from us, we know not how ſoon, and we taken from all things elſe. What if we ha d a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as <hi>Saul</hi> had, if we be forſaken of God, as he was. What if we had Paradiſe, if we offend God, we ſhall be caſt out? What if we had the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to be Apoſtles, if with <hi>Judas</hi> we have not God, what will all come to? What if a man ſhould enjoy all the world, if out of Chriſt, it would
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:170043:92"/>
yield him no comfort. As the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror ſaid, I have gone through all varieties of conditions, <hi>Et nibil mihi prodit:</hi> but it hath done me no good. If we had all what is it, but <hi>vanity of</hi>

               <hi>vanities,</hi> and not only ſo, but <hi>vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Now when we have God to be our God, he is able to fill the ſoul. He is larger then the ſoul, and he is able to quiet the ſoul, he is the reſt of the ſoul, the ſoul is quiet, in him is the Center, as the place of quiet. If God be ours, then the ſoul reſteth in it; for God filleth the ſoul, and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets the ſoul, and hath alwayes freſh comforts for the ſoul, infinite ſtill to all eternity. There is nothing in the world, but we do as it were <hi>deflorare,</hi> take away the flower of it by uſe, and it becometh ſtale. Though a man continue many thouſand years in the world, yet he will be weary of all things in the world, becauſe there is no freſhneſs in them. It is finite, and the ſoul is larger then the comforts of the world. But in God is a ſpring of freſh comforts to everlaſting. Conſider the things that inable him to be our God, to fill the ſoul, and to
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:170043:93"/>
be larger then the ſoul, to quiet, and calm the ſoul in all the troubles of it, and then to have freſh ſprings of comforts, what a comfort is this to have God, for our God?</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Never reſt till God be made our por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> Let it therefore raiſe up our ſouls to labor after our God, and never reſt till we have ſome intereſt in this great portion of God, to be our God. When we can by faith go out of our ſelves to Chriſt, and lay a right and juſt claim to God to be our God: this is a comfort that reacheth from everlaſting to everlaſting. It giveth us forgiveneſs of ſins, when we had loſt our ſelves, becauſe we are in Chriſt he hath forgiven us. In all extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and troubles, when no creature can comfort us, it is his glory to ſhew himſelf a God. It reacheth to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the body; God is <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams,</hi> and <hi>Iſaacks,</hi> and <hi>Jacobs</hi> God, when dead, becauſe he was the God of whole <hi>Abraham, Iſaack</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> and therefore of ſoul and body. And it reacheth from all favours of this world, ſo far as is for our good, to all eternity, being our <hi>God,</hi> he will protect us from all extremities in
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:170043:93"/>
this world, he will ſpeak comfort to our ſouls, which nothing can do but God. When we be dead, he will raiſe up our duſt, becauſe he is our whole God, the God of our ſouls and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and we ſhall be for ever with the Lord.

Theſe be mutual, whereſoever they be, whereſoever <hi>God</hi> is <hi>God</hi> to any, they by the ſpirit ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by Chriſt, have grace to make him ſo to themſelves.

Time may be, that he may be ſo; but till by the ſpirit of God we be brought to ſee an emptineſs, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in the Creature, and a nothing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in all, in compariſon of <hi>God,</hi> that we can ſay, <hi>whom have I in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven but thee?</hi> We have not comfort, becauſe we do not make him ours by a ſpirit of mutuallity.

Since this is the ſpring of all obedience, we ought to labor to make it good, and often to examine our ſelves, as before, what we make our God, and what we pitch our affections on. Alas, is our ſoul for any thing but God? hath not God made us for himſelf? and will our hearts reſt in any thing but God? why then ſhould we love va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and beſot our ſelves? when

            <p>Who giveth us a being to be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, to have a new nature, to have a good being, but God? who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth and preſerveth that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but God? and who keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and preſerveth us, till we get into a glorious being in Heaven; but God, who is all-ſufficient, ſelf-ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, ſole-ſufficient, only ſufficient, this God is our God now in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>God is to us in a more ſpecial ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular manner, then to other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, becauſe he hath raiſed us to a more excellent being, not only as men, we being in the higheſt rank of Creatures next the Angels, and ſo he is a God to us, more then to inferior Creatures, that have a more circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:170043:96"/>
and narrow being. Man hath a large being, a reaſonable ſoul, and is fitted by nature to have communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God, who is wiſdom it ſelf, and with Angels; but all this were little comfort, unleſs we had higher degrees of being then this. If God be our God in Chriſt, we have a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual being, which is as much above the dignity and prerogative of our ordinary being, as our being by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is above the baſeſt Creature in the world. And ſo God ſetteth a ſtile upon us ſutable to the excellency of our ſpirituall being: there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing excellent in the world, but we are learned by it. Now to let out the advancement and excellency of the dignity we have from God in a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner, to be <hi>Sons, Jewels,</hi> his <hi>Portion,</hi> his <hi>diadem,</hi> to be whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you can imagine, that is glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and excellent. An excellent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, though ſpiritual, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from the world. Gods Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are concealed men, as you ſhall ſee afterward, they be hidden men, the world taketh no notice of them, becauſe their excellency is ſeen with
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:170043:96"/>
another eye, then the world hath. The God of the world blindeth the eyes of worldlings. They cannot ſee into the excellency of Gods Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, no more then they can know <hi>God</hi> himſelf, and Chriſt himſelf. So you ſee what it is to be a <hi>God</hi> in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and in grace, to be all in all unto us, to have our whole ſubſiſtance, and dependence in him, <hi>in him we live and move, and have our being,</hi> and well-being.</p>
            <p>In this, our excellency conſiſteth, that <hi>God</hi> is our <hi>God</hi> in Chriſt, who was <hi>God,</hi> and that he might bring <hi>God</hi> and us to good tearms together, that he might make <hi>God</hi> our <hi>God,</hi> he was <hi>Emanuel,</hi> God with us, to make God with us in favour and love. The God-head is neareſt the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <note place="margin">Humane nature nearer to Chriſt then the nature of the Angels</note>of Chriſt, of any Creature, it is nearer to Chriſt then to the Angels; for God hath not taken the Angels into hypoſtatical union to be in the ſame perſon; but God in Chriſt is ſo near our nature, that there is an hypoſtatical union, they make one perſon, our nature being taken into the ſecond perſon. By reaſon of this
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:170043:97"/>
near union of the God-head to our nature cometh that comfort and near union between God and our nature, whereby <hi>God</hi> hath ſweet communion with us in Chriſt. <hi>God</hi> by his ſpirit, though not hypoſtatically, yet grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly is one with us, and hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with us now as his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: ſo that ſweet entercourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>God</hi> and us now, is founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the nearneſs of the god-head to our nature in Chriſt, in whom it is neareſt of all, in whom it is advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced above the angelical nature. And therefore our bleſſed Saviour might well ſay, <hi>I go to my God, and your God,</hi> to his <hi>God</hi> firſt, and then to our <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now we may ſay, <hi>God</hi> is our <hi>God,</hi> and upon good grounds, becauſe <hi>God</hi> is Chriſts <hi>God,</hi> and in him our <hi>God,</hi> which is a point of ſingular comfort, and therefore I will inlarge my ſelf further in it.</p>

If we have the field, we have the pearl in the field. And therefore the wiſe Merchant in the Goſpel, ſold all for the field, wherein the treaſure was. We have the field it ſelf in having God, and we have all that God is, or can do for us for our good, even as we have Chriſt, and all that Chriſt is, or hath done, and ſuffered, and injoyeth, <hi>all is ours, becauſe we are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith, ſo that having God, we have all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we have him that poſſeſſeth all, the Creator of all, and preſerver of all, and diſpoſer of all.</p>
            <p>But to clear an objection a little, if <hi>God</hi> be ours, and all things elſe,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:170043:98"/>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> I anſwer, it is our own fault for the moſt part, we want faith to make uſe of, and improve this comfort.

by an invincible ſtrength in the worſt condition that can be. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this is true, that <hi>God</hi> is our <hi>God</hi> in all conditions.</p>

reacheth, they will take Gods part in themſelves againſt themſelves, and in the world too. I will not inlarge the point, becauſe it cometh in by way of tryal, and I cannot but touch it as a tryal. Thus you ſee how we may know whether we be Gods or no, by owning his cauſe, and ſiding with him: you have ſome expreſſions in Scripture to this purpoſe. <hi>Micah</hi> 4. 5. <hi>All people will walk every one in the name of his God, and we will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever.</hi> Every man will walk and converſe in the name of his God, they will own their God, and take part with him, and we will walk in the name of our God for ever and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and own his cauſe at all times, and conſtantly for ever, and ever.</p>
            <p>And likewiſe in <hi>Eſay</hi> 44. ſpeaking of gratious times there, when men ſhall be bold for the Lord, as in all times ſome men will. One ſhall ſay I am the Lords, and another ſhall call himſelf by the name of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and another ſhall ſubſcribe with his hand to the Lord, and tearm himſelf <hi>Iſrael.</hi> God ſhall have his tongue, his hand,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:170043:104"/>
and all. He ſhall ſay I am the Lords, he ſhall call himſelf by the name of God, he ſhall ſubſcribe to it, and own the cauſe.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Again, if we would know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God be our God, we muſt know whether we may lay juſt claim to our God, as a peculiar God to us, or no, and that way in which God ſheweth himſelf to be a God in pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar reſpect to us.</p>
            <p>

He that hath a humble, believing, lowly <note place="margin">The hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent then the proud.</note>heart, hath more then all the world beſides; for he hath Gods peculiar gift.

good, he doth that which in the iſſue, ſhall further his accompt at the day of judgement, and there is the love of God ſhewed in his ſpecial fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
            <p n="2">2. So the love of God eſpecially, ſhall be a ſpecial peculiar comfort, that the world is ignorant of, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in times of extremity. Inward peace of conſcience, inward joy, and <note place="margin">Peace of conſcience inward joy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, ſigns of love.</note>inward comforts, theſe are ſigns of love, that God beſtoweth upon a man when he will own him in the worſt times, and ſpeak peace to his ſoul, when nothing in the world will ſpeak peace. When the Lyons roar, the great Lyons of the world roar in extremity, he hath inward peace and joy, and comforts of the holy Ghoſt, that inward intercourſe of God with the ſoul, is a ſign of Gods peculiar love, when God ſpeaketh peace to the ſoul, when he ſheweth the light of his countenance, which <hi>David</hi> in the 4th <hi>Pſalm</hi> prefers before all outward comforts whatſoever. Gods revealing of himſelf, as the Scripture calleth it. When God revealeth himſelf to his, to be theirs, with peace and joy, and
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:170043:106"/>
comfort, accompanying it, this is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Again, a peculiar favour and love-token of God, as to have ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and ſanctifying correction. To have corrections when they be ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, when we be in a way of ſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and God will bring us home by correction, and when we have ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying correction, we find by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that all is turned to our good. If I find any thing turn me to my God, I know I am his: if my Croſſe be ſeaſonable, and ſanctified, he is my God; for he takes that courſe with me, which he takes with his own people. Theſe be ſingular ſigns of Gods love, when he beſtoweth the graces of his ſpirit, his comforts, peace and joy, though not largely, yet ſo much as ſhall ſuſtain the ſoul. And then when he ſeaſonably meeteth us, and will not ſuffer us to thrive in an evil cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſe. Oh it is a judgment of judgements, to be hardned in ſinful courſes of life: how can it but end in deſperation at length? and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is a great favour to be chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, it ſheweth, we are Sons, and

               </gap>. Thus we ſee how we may lay juſt claim to this, that God is our God in a peculiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <p n="5">5. To name but one more, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh a ſpirit of preſumption, from a ſpirit of faith and truth, that God is our God, is this.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If we have grace to anſwer his dealings towards us. When we can eccho to Gods dealings; God hath choſen us, if we have grace to chuſe him for our God. We may know he hath called us effectually, when we anſwer Gods call: when he biddeth us believe, he giveth us an influence of power, to be able to ſay, <hi>I believe, Lord</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mark 9. 24</note>
               <hi>help my unbelief.</hi> We may know, he loveth us when we reflect love again, and love him; we may know he compaſſeth us, when we imbrace him; we may know he delighteth in us, when we can delight in him, and his Servants. Whence is the ſtrength of this Argument? from hence. All good things, whatſoever we do from God, is but by reflection. God ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on us firſt, God owneth us for his firſt, and God muſt do ſo in the order
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:170043:107"/>
of cauſes. God being the ſpring of all goodneſs, he muſt begin, we love him becauſe he loved us firſt, elſe we could never love him: therefore if we love him and his truth, he loveth <note place="margin">Pſal. 73. 25.</note>us, that is ſure. <hi>VVhat have I in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven but thee, and in earth in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of thee?</hi> ſurely he owneth us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in order of cauſes, we can have nothing but from him firſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And then again, out of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of conſcience, if we can go bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to him as a reconciled God, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding guilt of conſcience, it is a ſign he hath obtained peace of conſcience, becauſe it is the nature of conſcience, if it hath not peace from God, not to dare to appear in Gods preſence. So then, when there is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward peace and love, anſwering to Gods love, choice anſwerable to <note place="margin">Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Gods ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning upon the ſoul.</note>Gods choice, apprehending of him, anſwerable to his apprehenſion, this reflection and return, and rebounding back to God, is an invincible argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that God hath firſt ſhined upon that ſoul. God ſometimes will let us ſee things in the effect, and hide them in thecauſe. Perhaps he wil not perſwade b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Caution.</note> Therefore beloved, let us make uſe of this, and let us take heed of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious uſurpations, that we do not uſurp upon Gods houſe, or God in a peculiar reſpect.

And therefore they that live in courſes of rebellion, and reſolve not to mend, they take the holy things of God, as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks, <hi>Pſal</hi> 50. in an holy indignation, <hi>what art thou that takeſt my word in thy mouth, ſince</hi>

The Devils works you do, and will do; can we not take the word of the Covenant into our mouths, and ſhall we take the ſeal of the Covenant? therefore reſolve to amend, elſe have nothing to do with God, do not add one ſin to another. It is Childrens food, and not for Doggs, it belongeth to them of the family. If thou be none of the Family, what haſt thou to do with them? If thou be of the Family, whatſoever thy infirmities are, thou

maiſt come boldly; for the ſeals are to ſtrengthen our weak faith. When <note place="margin">Simile.</note>the Father is Father of a Child, the Father will not caſt away the Child for breaking out with deformity, or lameneſs; when God hath taken us into his Family, infirmities cannot diſcard us. But I ſpeak of them, that in a wilful oppoſite courſe of ſin ſhew they never had to do with God in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar entercourſe, God never gave them a ſpirit to alter their natures. Propriety and proportion, and ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of diſpoſition go together, propriety joyneth with ſuitableneſs; where God owneth any man, he makes them like himſelf by his word and ſpirit, that their natures ſhall be even and agreeable to holy things, ſhall have a taſt of holy things. And <note place="margin">Propriety, by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Let us not deceive our ſelves; but if vve

find ſome beginnings of grace, and can ſay without arrogancy, or uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, <hi>doubtleſs thou art our Father, our God,</hi> we be not worthy to be thine; but we be thine. If we finde ſomething that caſt-awayes cannot have, ſome grief of heart for ſin, ſome faith, ſome little meaſure of love, ſome love of truth, and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the beſt things, then we may come boldly to increaſe our familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and communion with God; but otherwiſe it is dangerous to come to <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 29 Eſa. 33. 14</note>God, we approach a conſuming fire, <hi>who ſhall dwell in everlaſting burnings?</hi> ſay they in <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and if God be not in covenant with us, oh he will be conſuming fire, everlaſting burnings, and we but ſtubble, &amp; it will increaſe ſpiritual judgment in us, hardneſs of heart, and going on from ſin, to ſin, till we be accurſed for ſin: therefore it is a fearful thing to be given up to hardneſs of heart, they that do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in ſin, God giveth them up to hardneſs of heart, to be inſenſible of his dealings with them.</p>

            <p>And therefore let us learn to ſingle out of God whatſoever may help us to be in covenant with him.

And therefore we deſerve not the names of religious perſons, if we do not ſtudy what he is to his Creatures in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace.

is to ſeal that God is our God in particular, and that Chriſt is ours, <note place="margin">Sacrament ſeals God to be ours.</note>as verily as the Bread and Wine are ours.

will not be ſaved but by his own foolery. A man that hath a bitter ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit againſt the power of grace, that is a common blaſphemer, that carrieth a ſpight againſt Religion, for him to ſay, <hi>God is his God,</hi> the Devil will as well ſay ſo.

For a man to live in ſins againſt Conſcience, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them, oppoſe all that oppoſeth his ſins, and yet claim an intereſt, while that diſpoſition ſtandeth in him, it is more then ſatanical impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, and it is extream hardening of the heart againſt all goodneſs; for how many thouſands in the Church periſh, and ſink to Hell under this preſumptuous conceipt, <hi>I am Gods, and God is mine,</hi> when the title is falſe, and the evidence falſe. And therefore is is a point deſerving throughly to be examined continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what thoſe evidences of graces be, that we venture our ſouls and ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon.

<pb n="205" facs="tcp:170043:111"/>
be ours, there will be a ſeparation, where there is an owning of God for our God; There will be a ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from all that is not his, as well as a gathering to them that be his. The work of Gods ſpirit in his Children, is like fire, which hath two proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to ſever all heterogeneal and ſtrange ſtuffe and droſſe, and the like, and gather all the homogeneal ſtuffe of one nature. And ſo the works of the ſpirit gathereth to the ſoul ſo much as is good, and refines that, and ſevereth that which is contrary. That ſpirit of God, that telleth them that <note place="margin">Gods ſpirit both a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering ſpirit, and an uniting ſpirit.</note>they be Gods, it is is a ſevering ſpirit, and a uniting ſpirit, it ſevers contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and it uniteth things of the ſame nature, there is a joyning to what is good, and a ſeparating of what is evil.</p>
            <p>I will add this farther, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever on good title, we can ſay, <hi>I am Gods,</hi> there is a reflect act of the ſoul to ſay, <hi>God is mine.</hi> God hath <note place="margin">Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in mutual office of duty.</note>put a light of reaſon and friendſhip into man. Now friendſhip ſtandeth in mutual office of duty and gift, where this is not, there is no friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:170043:112"/>
no reconciliation, no owning on good tearms. The end why God ſaveth a company of men, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them to Heaven, the body of Chriſt, which we call the Church, it is, that he may have eternal commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with them in the Heavens, as he hath with the bleſſed Angels, and in Chriſt a nearer communion, then he hath with them. Now how can this communion be, unleſs we turn to God, unleſs we have ſomething to anſwer Gods love.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Doct.</note> Again note, God is ours, becauſe Chriſt is ours, the Covenant is firſt made with Chriſt, and then with us. Whence we ſee a ground of particular application of that which we call particular faith, a ground of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar application, by a ſpirit of faith of God to us, and Chriſt to us, that God in Chriſt is my God, and your God.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">God to be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended as he offers himſelf.</note> The ground of this is, as God of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth himſelf, we muſt apprehend him; but Chriſt offers God, and he knoweth how to offer him. He teacheth us how God is to be preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and he preſenteth him as our God,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:170043:112"/>
and our Father, and therefore let us entertain him, as ours. Thus you ſee a good ground of particular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of God the Father, and Chriſt to us in particular, in two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, <note place="margin">Particular applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt how grounded.</note>not only that every one in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ought to have a particular faith, and not to think a general faith is enough to believe, as the Church believeth; but to have a particular faith of the object, not only of the ſubject, but of the object, that, that is his in particular, <hi>I go to my Father and your Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God is the Father, and the God of all the Elect, and only the Elect, and of every one of the Elect, as we ſay <hi>in ſolidum:</hi> that is ſaid to be <hi>in ſolidum,</hi> when every one applieth the whole to himſelf, without diminution of any part. The ſum is <hi>in ſolidum</hi> to every one that will make uſe of it, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten every Creature that ſhutteth not his eyes. As a common Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain is no mans in particular; for no man can ſay this is my Fountain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and yet every man can ſay this is mine: ſo that every Saint can ſay of God, he is mine <hi>in ſolidum,</hi> though
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:170043:113"/>
he were alone, he may ſay God is mine. If ten thouſands have him, yet God is his God. <hi>god careth for all, as if there were but one, and for one, as if none but he.</hi> God offers himſelf, not only to his whole Church, but to every one in particular, and therefore of every one he ought to be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended.</p>
            <p>This is founded in all the great points and myſteries of Religion. As for inſtance, what is the ground of all the Petitions in the Lords Prayer? <hi>Our Father.</hi> What intereſt have we to all the Petitions, and to every Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the Creed, if there be not a particular application? <hi>I believe God the Father to be my God, Jeſus Chriſt my Saviour, the Holy Ghoſt my Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier, remiſſion of ſins, and life everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is mine.</hi> We do no more then the Devils. Now every truth in Scripture is written for our comfort, and ſhall it be no more comfort to us, then to the Devils? doth the Scripture in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend us no more comfort then the Devils? yes; but the Devil may ſay for the Church, there is remiſſion of ſins, and a God and Saviour; but not
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:170043:113"/>
for me, and that is his torment, he cannot come to particulars. So the Sacraments are to ſeal a particular faith, as every one in particular taketh the bread and wine, ſo by a particular <note place="margin">Sacraments ſeal a particular faith.</note>faith, every one may ſay, Chriſt is mine, his death is mine, blood-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hed mine, remiſſion of ſins and intereſt of Chriſt is mine. It doth not ſeal a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral faith in the Clouds, but a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular aſſurance, that it belongeth to every one. And ſo in the words of the Catechiſe, the miniſterial queſtioning of ſinners, is intended, that every one that believeth, ſhould apply it. If thou believeſt, and if thou believeſt, thou ſhalt be ſaved, and thy ſins ſhall be forgiven thee. So that if we regard prayer and faith, if we regard the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, or the uſe of the Catechiſe, all inforce a particular faith. If we have not particular faith, we loſe the vertue of all. So it is for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements; put caſe, no man is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in particular, yet every one ought to ply in particular, that they ought to abſtain from ſuch a ſin, and perform ſuch duty; if they do ſo, they ſhall be glorified, if not, they ſhall be
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:170043:114"/>
puniſhed. And there is the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in faith, as in obedience. A man is condemn'd in Law, though not named in Law, becauſe the general is ſet down here, and every man ought particularly to apply it, I ought not to have done ſo, and ſo. So that it overturneth the end of all, if a man labor not for a particular faith. To go farther. Now if I diſablethis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of particular faith of Gods love, and Chriſts love, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And therefore I beſeech you, let us comfort our ſelves in this, labouring for a particular faith, and then labor to maintain our intereſt notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our infirmities and faults, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:170043:114"/>
our ſins paſt. Let not Satan rob us of our claim, that God is our God, and Father in Chriſt. Let us learn of Chriſt, we cannot have a better pattern. What doth Chriſt on the Croſſe, when he had the ſins of all the believing world upon him, and had there been ten thouſand times more, it had been all one, to ſo infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite a perſon <hi>God-man,</hi> he had made full ſatisfaction to Gods juſtice. But having ſo much upon him, did it take away his claim of God, as his God? It did not, but ſtill he ſaid, <hi>my God, my God.</hi> Was it a claim that did him any good? was it a uſeful claim? yes, for it was made good by his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and Aſcenſion, and therefore he might well ſay, <hi>I go to my God, and your God.</hi> I have overcome the wrath of God due for ſin, and therefore <note place="margin">If Chriſt hath ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for us notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, we may call God our God.</note>when I that had all the ſins of the world upon me, acknowledged God, to be my God, and underwent the burden of Gods wrath, and ſatisfied for all ſin, you may well ſay my God, not only from the pattern of Chriſt, becauſe he did ſo, but as a cauſe; I may ſay ſo, now becauſe Chriſt ſaid
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:170043:115"/>
ſo then; for he hath fully ſatisfied his Father, who had laid that burden on him: you therefore that have particular burdens of your own ſins, and have not that other; but have a conſcience troubling you, it is for good, becauſe if you believe, that is taken away. But put caſe you had the guilt of your own ſins, and of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſins beſide, what is that to this of Chriſt, who had the guilt of all ſin? And therefore let no guilt hinder you from a ſpirit of faith, to ſay, <hi>my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and my God.</hi> Is Chriſt aſcended to Heaven, to be a mediator of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to appear before God; for whom? is it not for ſinners? what work is there in Heaven for a media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, if we were not daily ſinners? Chriſt that hath ſatisfied for ſin, bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth us after ſatisfaction, to think of God as a Father, and to think of his aſcenſion, even for this end, to appear before God for us as our High-Prieſt, to make daily peace for us. His blood is of everlaſting efficacy. And <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 24.</note>if <hi>Abels</hi> blood cried for vengeance, the blood of Chriſt crieth for mercy. As the appearing of the blood of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi>
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:170043:115"/>
ſpake for vengeance, ſo the very appearing of Chriſt ſpeaks enough for mercy to the ſinner.</p>
            <p>It is a comfortable clauſe, that in <hi>Hoſea</hi> 2. 19. where God ſaith, <hi>He will marry them in everlaſting mercy:</hi> ſo that mercy is part of the joynture of the Church. God will marry them in mercy; in what mercy? in pardoning <note place="margin">Mercy part of our mariage portion.</note>mercy; as the Husband is to bear with the wife, the weaker Veſſel, not to put her away for infirmities. Shall we attribute mercie to men, and not to God? Can a friend bear the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of a friend, and a Huband of a Wife? &amp; cannot Chriſt bear the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of his ſpouſe? and therefore never think that our infirmities may hinder our claim: you ſee it did not here. But, <hi>go to my Father, and your Father.</hi> This comfort we ſhall be <note place="margin">Object.</note>driven to make uſe of ſometime or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; therefore make uſe of it now. <note place="margin">Anſw.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But you will ſay, this is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort for common ſort of Chriſtians, it is not, and I intend it not for them. It is Childrens bread, and it muſt not be caſt to Doggs: therefore they that have not God for their God, and live in any ſin, they can lay no claim to
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:170043:116"/>
him; for they ſerve another God in their hearts, their vile courſes are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of their God, and in their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections above their God: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let them not think any promiſe belongeth to them in that courſe. Let them think of God, as a conſuming ſire, as everlaſting burnings, while they be ſuch, and that their peace is as the peace that the ſoul hath when the ſtrong man holdeth all in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. When the conſcience is ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and God hath given them up to hardneſs of heart, which is a deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate peace. This belongeth to them, that are reſolved not to live in any ſin, that have given themſelves up to God: and yet by reaſon of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of corruption, are driven to make uſe of that Petition, which <note place="margin">Uſe.</note>Chriſt bids them to pray, <hi>forgive us our daily ſins.</hi>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Aſſurance.</note> Hence iſſueth this truth, that a Chriſtian may be aſſured of his ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this world. For firſt of all grant, that we ought particularly to apply, as God offers himſelf to us, and that no infirmities, nor ſins hinder this claim, then what followeth? but a
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:170043:116"/>
Chriſtian believing, and repenting of his ſins daily, may be aſſured that he is in the ſtate of grace, becauſe there be grounds of particular application, that therefore which ſeems to diſable that intereſt, hinders not at all. And therefore labor to maintain that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable ſtate of aſſurance, by all means; the grounds of it is, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar application, notwithſtanding all ſins and infirmities whatſoever, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Satan envieth it moſt, becauſe it is a ſtate wherein we honor God moſt.</p>
            <p>I will not enter largely into the point, becauſe I have ſpoken of it in other Texts; but for as much as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth this time, we muſt labor for that, without the which we cannot go through that which God calleth us to.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There be many duties and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions that God requires, which we cannot be in, without aſſurance of ſalvation on good grounds; what is that? God bids us be thankful in all things, how can I know that? unleſs I know God is mine, and Chriſt is mine, can I be thankful for that which I doubt of, and think I ought to doubt of? therefore it is ſuch a
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:170043:117"/>
ſtate, without which I cannot perform other duties, and particularly the grand duty of thankfulneſs. And what a pittiful ſtate is this, that a man ſhould not be thankful for Chriſt, nor Heaven, nor for the ſtate of another world, that there ſhould be ſuch great matters, and yet they cannot thank God for them.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <note place="margin">Joy ſprings from knowledg.</note> 2. Again, God enjoyneth us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce. <hi>Rejoyce, and again I ſay, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce.</hi> Can a man rejoyce, that his name is written in Heaven, and not know his name is written there? The Diſciples were very weak now, and yet notwithſtanding all their infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, they loved Chriſt, they caſt themſelves upon him, and had not choſen another Saviour. Therefore <note place="margin">Luk. 10. 20</note>
               <hi>rejoyce that your names are written in Heaven,</hi> and how can a man rejoyce, that knoweth it not to be ſo? By Gods writing of the Law in a mans heart, he may know his name is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Heaven. Can a man alwayes rejoyce, if he hath not grounds why?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Again, God requires chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, God loveth a chearful giver,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:170043:117"/>
and a chearful doer. It is the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, <note place="margin">Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice muſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note>that is required in every thing, give me thy heart in every thing thou doſt. Alas, how can I perform chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſervice to God, when I doubt whether he be my God, and Father, or no? ſhall not I labor for a heart to yield chearful obedience, doth it not come deadly off? ſurely it doth. We ought to comfort our ſelves, and how can a man comfort himſelf in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition full of uncertainties, no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts are comfortable without this, That God is our God, and our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, unleſs we know this; comforts themſelves are not comfortable unto us. None of the comforts we have, the comforts of this life, are not comforts to us, when the ſoul ſaith, perhaps God feeds me to ſlaughter, and perhaps I have theſe mercies as my portion in this world, <note place="margin">No world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts can ſatisfie the ſoul.</note>and how can he be comfortable, when he apprehendeth not, that they iſſue from a ſpring of love, alas, comforts themſelves are uncomfortable. And therefore ſhall not I labor for that, without which I cannot be comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, eſpecially it being a diſpoſition
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:170043:118"/>
for our good, to be thankful, and chearful, and joyful, and large heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p n="4">4. God requires a diſpoſition in us that we ſhould be full of incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, and ſtrong in the Lord, and that we ſhould be couragious for his cauſe, in withſtanding his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and our enemies. How can there be courage in reſiſting our corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Satans temptations, how can there be courage in ſuffering perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and croſſes in the world, if there be not ſome particular intereſt we have in Chriſt, and in God, it cannot be ſo? unleſſe we will denie obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to all duty injoyned, we muſt <note place="margin">Aſſurance earneſtly to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bored for.</note>have this aſſurance which enters into all, which is the ſpirit that quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, and enliveneth all. Therefore labor for it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Elſe we ſhall take away the grounds that God inforceth good duties from in Scripture, as he doth <note place="margin">3 Col. 12.</note>inforce duty from this ground. <hi>As Elect, ſee ye put on bowels of compaſſion.</hi> I beſeech you <hi>by the mercies of God, Rom.</hi> 12. <hi>offer your ſelves as a ſacrifice
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:170043:118"/>
to God</hi> Alas, I know not whether I ſhall have mercy or no; why take away your ground, and overthrow your principles. And therefore ſhall not we labor for that ſtate of ſoul wherein we are fitted to be in that diſpoſition, and to perform duty as God would have us. I therefore beſeech you la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor for aſſurance of ſalvation.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Grounds of aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note> That we may maintain it the better, ſee the grounds of it. It is not in our perfection, for then the poor Diſciples, where had they been? Alas they had dealt unfaithfully with Chriſt; but the ground of firmneſs is on Gods ſide, the certainty is on Gods part, not ours. Tell them <hi>I go to my Father, and my God, and their Father and their God.</hi> Though we make breaches eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, yet God breaketh not, as <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. <hi>Verily I the Lord am not changeable, and therefore you are not conſumed.</hi> We change, ebbe and flowe, are to and fro, up and down every day, varying in our diſpoſitions, though there be ſome root and ſeed of grace in us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, yet there is a change in our diſpoſitions every day, but it holdeth
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:170043:119"/>
on Gods part; and therefore Chriſt nameth not any qualification in <note place="margin">Aſſurance maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us on Gods part.</note>them to build comfort on, but <hi>my God,</hi> and <hi>your God,</hi> will yet maintain the relation of a Father to you, that have not dealt as you ſhould do, and maintaineth the relation of a God, notwithſtanding your fall. So that we maintain not our aſſurance on any part in us, but on Gods love. <hi>Whom he loveth, he loveth to the end.</hi> Our God <note place="margin">John 13. 1.</note>unchangably loveth us, in whom there is not ſo much as a ſhadow of change. And therefore in the laſt of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi> it is called an everlaſting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. <hi>The God of peace that brought</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Heb. 13. 20</note>
               <hi>again from the dead our Lord Jeſus the great Shepherd of the ſheep, through the blood of the everlaſting Covenant.</hi> By the blood of Chriſt there is an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant, God will be our God to death, and in death, and for ever. For this relation being on Gods part, extendeth it ſelf from forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſins to life everlaſting. It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, the blood of Chriſt is the blood of an everlaſting Covenant. I will marry thee to me for ever. It

holdeth ſure on Gods part. <note place="margin">Hoſ. 2. 18.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Let us therefore labor to maintain this aſſurance of ſalvation from Gods love.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But for our comfort, we muſt do our parts too, though it begin with God. It beginneth on Gods part.

            <p>That we may further maintain this Relation, that God is our God; Let us labor to get into Chriſt, for it is in him that God is our Father, and to grow up in Chriſt, to growe more and more, to grow up in faith, and in all grace.</p>
            <p>A gratious Chriſtian never wanteth arguments of aſſurance of ſalvation; It is the dead-hearted Chriſtian, the careleſs Chriſtian: therefore labor, as to be in Chriſt, ſo to grow up in the knowledge of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And ſo to know God in Chriſt, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor to ſee the face of God in Chriſt, for in him are all the beams of his love, as the beames of the Sun in a <note place="margin">Simile.</note>glaſſe are gathered, ſo the beams of all Gods love meet in Chriſt. So lovely is God in Chriſt, whatſoever we have in Chriſt, it is from God in Chriſt. And whatſoever we have from God, it is through Chriſt, therefore growe in the knowledge of Chriſt, in faith in Chriſt. To this end are the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that we might growe up in
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:170043:121"/>
him, and be fed into Chriſt. And then we may make right uſe of it, as the Ordinance that God hath ſanctified for this end. And as God doth take us out &amp; ſet a ſtamp upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> us, ſo labor to make choyce of God more &amp; more, &amp; choice of God in Chriſt; for there be the 2. ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of our faith &amp; love.

He ſetteth us apart from other men, taking us out, and appropriateth us to himſelf, chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth us for his Jewels. I beſeech you labor daily to chuſe God to be your God. If we ſay, we are Gods, let us make choyce of him at the ſame time, and appropriate him with our choyce. He is mine in particular, there is renunciation of all others. I have ſerved other Gods heretofore, the world, and the fleſh, and the favor of man have been my God, but they ſhall be my God no more: If we chuſe him not, and appropriate him as ours, and renounce all other, and give our ſelves to him, we cannot ſay he is <hi>our God:</hi> this we ſhould practice every day: In the ſolicitation of ſin, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair

            <p>If when we be moved to any ſin by Satan, or our own fleſh, which is a Devil within us: this is contrary to my Covenant, this is contrary to the <note place="margin">The fleſh a Devil within us.</note>renewing of the Covenant, ſo often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in the Sacrament, &amp; therefore I will not commit it. It is contrary to the State I am advanced to, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to my relation, God is my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and my God; and therefore I muſt be his, and what have I to do with ſin? what hath pride to do with a heart bequeathed to God? what
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:170043:122"/>
hath luſt and filthineſs? what hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, or any thing elſe that is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, to do in a heart that hath dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and conſecrated it ſelf to God, who hath given up himſelf, and all he can do, and to whom we have given up all we have, and ſhall we give our ſtrength to ſin and Satan, his enemies?</p>
            <p>Thus we ſhould grow in aſſurance, exerciſing the increaſe and knowledge of our intereſt. I beſeech you therefore let us uſe theſe and the like things to make God our God. And if any temptation for ſin be joyned, as Satan cannot but ſolicit to ſin; ſo he labor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth when we have ſinned, to tempt to deſpair for ſin; for they be the two wayes by which Satan prevails.

therefore anſwer Satan; I ought not to abuſe and break off, and deny my intereſt in God, as my Father, and my God, for any ſin, becauſe the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples did not ſo; and Chriſt hath taught how to make uſe of God, and to acknowledge him for my comfort. We cannot have a better guide then God, and therefore never think of God, but as <hi>our God</hi> and <hi>our Father,</hi> and labor to anſwer all Satans temptations in that kinde from hence.</p>

Again, this aſſurance that God is our God in Chriſt, and our Father, is wrought by the ſealing of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and ſanctifying of us: therefore take heed, we grieve not the ſpirit of <hi>God. Gods</hi> ſpirit moveth our hearts often times in hearing the word, or reading or praying, when we have any good motions, or when we enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them, and therefore do not grieve the ſpirit of <hi>God,</hi> whoſe office is to ſeal us to the day of redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to aſſure us <hi>God</hi> is our <hi>God,</hi> and our Father in Chriſt.

            <p>This is the way to maintain aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that God is our God. For men may be led with a ſpirit of preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſay, God is my God. But if Conſcience telleth them, they live in ſin againſt Conſcience, and the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the ſpirit, and ſuppreſs them and kill them, as birthes that they would not have grow in their hearts, then they cannot ſay, God is my God, but conſcience telleth them they lie. And therefore I beſeech you, labor for an holy life. That faith that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth this claim, that God is my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.</note>It is a faith quickening the ſoul, a faith purifying, a faith cleanſing.

We muſt know our diſtances: there muſt be reverent cariage to God. A looſe <note place="margin">Pſal. 2. 11.</note>Chriſtian can never injoy the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of God.

we ought to love him with fear, and rejoyce with trembling. Humble thy ſelf to walk with thy God, where there is a great deal of humility, it maintaineth friendſhip. We cannot walk with God, as a friend as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> is ſaid to be Gods friend. We muſt acknowledge our ſelves to be duſt and aſhes, know him in his greatneſs, and our ſelves in our meanneſs, if he will maintain this to our hearts, that God is our God. If we be careful to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this, ſurely he that delighteth himſelf in the proſperity of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, will delight to make himſelf more and more known to us, that we may be aſſured of our ſalvation.</p>
            <p>All that hear me, are ſuch as have not yet made choice of God, to be their God, or have made choice.

He muſt be friend or enemy, there is no third in God. God and the Devil di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide all mankind, they ſhare all. If thou be not Gods, and canſt not ſay ſo, on good titles, thou art the Devils.
