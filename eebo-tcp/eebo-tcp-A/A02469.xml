            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And yet, lo, these matters of weight, this worde of power, thys
<pb facs="tcp:12774:3"/>
gospell of newenes of lyfe is made so gamesome a thynge, that in steppeth Danus and Syrus to determine bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene doctours. I speake not now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the libertye of good profession, in any estate or degree, least it myght be saide, I spake againste the knowen trueth. Trueth and sooth it is, that God may be &amp; is glorified by the riche pore, high low, yong olde.

Wherefore let vs thinke it (as it is) a piece of duetye to speake within a compasse, consideringe that if our owne name and fame be by any man rashlye impugned, we accoumpt it vyolence, we complayn that we are
<pb facs="tcp:12774:3"/>
iniuried. Namely if I should beginne with your beginning (M.

Onely I meruayle who is mayster of the workes in Louayne, that suffreth euery pratyng pioner and inferior la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer to vse his tongue for a pytche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forke, and to bestowe such durty dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynges vpon men of renowmed lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and worthy authority. But that you shall not thinke you haue cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye man into an agonye, I sende you word from Cambridge, that nothing is so heauely taken, as the whole is vnseemely in a man of your occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. A labourer quoth you? not in al <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasmus de copia</hi> so fitte a title. Euen so (as you haue shewed your selfe) for al the worlde, is <hi>operarius</hi> taken <hi>in Tullie 1. de oratore.</hi> There were in Tullyes time, in tharte of Rhetorique certaine vpstartes, which of that excellent sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

When such artificers steppe in, they geue men occasion to scowre olde rusty prouerbes such as these: A sowe gaue a leape, a popyniay pyped, an asse braied, a match made betwene an Egle and a Iackedawe, a Sowrer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue his latchet. &amp;c.

And so doth he. He deceyueth now his deare frin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des on both sides, as well the learned as thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned. But it could not otherwise be, and his epistle was not eyther at the first compiled, or at the last translated so much for argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t as for eloquence. Forsoothe in the vertue of the seuen sciences, they will openly vanquish &amp; confou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de this new founde arte of gospellinge.

And all this shall come <hi>De profundis.</hi> Yet there is more, and that I gesse by mayster Shacklocks nedeles translation.

but shalbe matched with a contrary printe, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wag but it shalbe seasoned on, nothinge so soone set out, but it shall haue an onset. And all in haste, in speede: or elles were all disgraced. Then must the ghospell nedes fall downe, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistry be hoysed vp and restored againe, rowme made for Idolators througheout all Inglande, letters flye in haste from the M. of the Postes, the sincportes all be spread open, shyppes pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,<note place="margin">

               </note> and a syde winde knytte fast in a woolsack to be ready at an howre. All this may be. For, I tell you, an impossybylitee with a Papyst is no straunge thinge. That is, is not: and that is not, is. And that cannot be, shalbe. And many things are there, that passe our symple wittes. As for example: the Popishe Byshoppes wear endew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with byshoprikes, and were thereof lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye defeated, and our Byshoppes are nowe in possession, by as good authority royall warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and yet are the Papisticall Byshoppes the dewe owners, yea no man may say, nay: and it hath bene pleaded by the common lawe.

And yet doubt I not (by the grace of god and pacience of the reader) streight way to proue a contrarye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.

            <p>AFter that by the naughty perswasion, and Bedlem boldnes of some, men for soke that religion whych from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles time, euen to our age hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued inuincible, that they myghte walke in that path, whych with a shew of licenciousnes did draw foolishe and vnaduised men vnto it, I say, after that thys new deuised religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was spred abroade by meanes of many sedicious ser<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mons, and erronious bookes, wee haue seene shamefastnes sodenly to be shaken of, honestye to be chased out of the countrye, man hys lawe and God his law to be troden vnder foote, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things to be prophaned, godlines to be iested at, boldnes euery where to scape scotfree, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamefastnes☞ to be maynteyned, many opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s contrary one to the other, to be scattred abrode, the vnitye of Chryst to be torne wyth sutes of diuers sectes, and in euerye place where these mad me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue come, the fier of horrible discord to haue ben blowen vp.</p>
            <p>Out of thys root haue sprong deadly displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,☞ often vprores, perilous dagger drawin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: hereof many bloudye battelles haue bene fought, manye slaughters done, manye spoyles commited, many mennes possessions destroyed wyth fyer and sword.</p>
            <p>What crueltye appeareeth in many of them, which haue ben the authors of these opinions, wyth what disdainfull arrogancy do they iette vp and down, with what malipertnes and cur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sed
<pb facs="tcp:12774:9"/>
speaking they rayle vpon good men?</p>
            <p>☞Adde now hereunto, the breach of lawes, the contempt of rule, the hatred of kingly authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the vnmercifull treasons whyche these men most diuelyshly deuise against Princes. Recke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> here also, their secrete whisperings, when they cast their heades together how to destroy and vndo their kings, whylst most shamefully they worke their wo, for whose wealth and good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, they ought to serue and cal vpon God.</p>
            <p>☞All these people pleasers, for so much as they te men of no wysedome or discretion, but be led with an inordinate desier of libertye, they loue not law, they defye iusticers, they wish in their hearts that kinges were at the deuil, that they wythout controlment might liue as they lyst.</p>
            <p>☞They couet to be set fre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> law &amp; order, that they may be bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d slaues to their own wil &amp; nau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ghty affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, is there any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can deny this?</p>
            <p>☞Doth not euery man see that they shoote all at this marke, that Princes beinge dispatched out of the way, there might be none left which should once say, blacke is their eye? Therefore some kings they haue poisoned, some they haue attempted to kil with the sword, and haue cast manye mischeuous fetches, howe to pull them out of their seat.</p>
            <p>It is the entent and meaninge of this newe deuysed religion, by hooke or by crooke to seke the death of those Princes, which wyl not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake the religion in whych they haue bene ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuously and wysely brought vp, to come to the
<pb facs="tcp:12774:9"/>
lure of the madde people.</p>
            <p>The ende of this secte, is ouermuche lyber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, whiche can be kepte in no order, then the whiche, nothinge can be more contrary to the office and regiment of kynges.</p>
            <p>The ignoraunte people, so sone as they haue gotten people pleasing captaines, which with their rayling sermons may puffe them vp as it were with windye blastes, and raise mightye waues of folly and madnesse, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>At the last being growne to a headd, it wyll☞ pull kynges oute of their throne, and so when it is to late, they shall se that they haue bredde their owne bane, whiche they shall not be able to remedy when they wolde.</p>
            <p>Doth not this sect euery where styrre vp se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition?☞ doth it not breake the bandes of al ius<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and lawes? doth it not resist rule &amp; kynge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly regymente? doth it not put al men in hope of to muche lewde libertie? For where is rule most despised? where are the Prynces had in most derision of the common people? surely in those places where this pestilent learning doth gett the vpper hande. Therfore if this madde enterprise taken mischeuously in hande of these people pleasers, and vnaduysedly winked at of Prynces, shall grow to a ripenes, which way so euer it taketh, it wyll quite ouerturne al the☞ defence and strength of kyngly estate.</p>
            <p>This sect is the vndoinge of common weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes,☞ the marring of good manners, the spoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge of kingedomes, and the destruction of all

kyngly honour.</p>
            <p>What manner a fellowe was this Luther? surely that I maye speake the beste of him, he was a man neither sobre, neyther dyscrete, but ☞hedlonge, rashe, mischeuous, seditious, and of al other the greatest people pleasure, and what manner of men were they whiche afterwarde spronge out of his schole as out of a well? vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doughtedly, bolde, standinge in their own co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyte, puffed vp with pryde.</p>
            <p>How commeth it to passe that god now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his accustomed manner, should ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hip symple and humple men, and shewe theim this newe and straunge light, whiche haue no ☞sparke of shamefastnes or modestie?</p>
            <p>How commeth it to passe, that these fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es who as it appereth by many tokens, be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to worldly delightes, haue onely most wit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tely spied out that which was vnknowen to so holy fathers.</p>
            <p>They whiche are not to be reuerenced for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny notable vertue, be not able to performe that whiche they do pretende.</p>
            <p>O These be men worthy to be wondred at, &amp; with cap and knee to be worshipped.</p>
            <p>They forsoth, haue mortified all their sences with fayth, they haue parted the foule from the body, neither do they onely defye man his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ☞but also they despise all the authorities of holy men.

<pb facs="tcp:12774:10"/>
but god, and that they may make none other of their councell but the holy ghost.</p>
            <p>If theyr shameful doinges, do disproue their shameles sayinges, shall we beleue them, so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as they make their vaunt that they follow onely the worde of God?<note place="margin">Proue your selfes by this rule.</note> for if in all their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inges they do according to God his word, then they followe not couetousenes, hatred, wrath, ambition, but they be al together made perfect with vertues whiche springe out of the worde of God. If they be not indued with suche hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly vertues, then do they lie in sayinge, that they only and altogether do frame them selues to the worde of God, for wyckednes and the worde of God can not dwell together. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore eyther they direct not theyr lyffe after the worde of god, eyther they do not commyt any abhominable or shameful sinne, for if they sinne shamefully, and abhominably, vndoughtedly they be not squared to the worde of God.</p>
            <p>They committ many heynouse offences and synnes, as all the worlde can witnes, therfore☞ it is false to saye that they be gouerned with God his worde, and the inspiration of the holy ghost.</p>
            <p>Nowe then, I wold wyllingly heare of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whether these many yeres they haue wrought any notable feate, whiche maye inforce vs to confesse that they ground onely vpon the word of God.</p>
            <p>O say they, we will rushe in to those how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, in whiche holy virgins being inclosed, day
<pb facs="tcp:12774:11"/>
and night do singe hymnes to the glory of god, and praye to Christ for the good estate of kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and prynces,<note place="margin">Many fair wordes, where in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede was the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary</note> and for the sauegarde of the whole communaltie. We wyll pull downe the fences of shamfastnes, we will breake open the inclosures of charitie, and we wyll no longer suffer well fauoured vyrgins to be barred of their solace and pleasures, to lacke the comfort and ayde of their chyldren, and to spende theyr younge yeares in sorrowfull solytarynes, and myserable vnfrutefulnes.</p>
            <p>We will make a lawe for Monkes, or solita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye lyuers, whose howses we will pull downe likwyse, or let theym out to hyer, it skilleth not to what lay men, and charge them vnder paine ☞of deathe that hereafter, none presume for reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious sake, to wrastle continually agaynst hys lecherous lustes. For why? It is an heynous offence, and in no sauce to be borne withall.</p>
            <p>Who doeth not see, when the religious rules whiche be conteyned in the Popes constytuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, be taken awaye, that all feare is putte to fiyght, and lycencious lyuing doth reigne with out controlment? As who wold say (say they) we shote at anye other marcke, then to pull all feare out of mennes myndes? For we be the ☞patrones of perfect liberty, and it is so farre of, that we will suffer those whiche be our descy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, to stande in awe of anye thinge, that wee will quite sette them free from fearing of God. For the whiche thinge verely our scollers are muche beholdinge to vs, for it was to sore an

hart breake day and nyght to feare god, and by that meanes, to pine awaye with consuminge carefulnes. Therefore we haue commaunded all those that beleue in Christ, to sette cocke on☞ hoope, and cry care away. For we beare theym in hande, that fayth is of such force, that laying once hande of it, though he be neuer so mische<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous a lyin of the Deuyll, yet he may warrant himselfe the fauour of Christe, and blesse euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastinge.</p>
            <p>I pray thee, who euer was suche a people☞ parasite, so seruiceable to please the madnes of the common sorte, that he durste be so bolde as to encourage men from fearing of god.</p>
            <p>Such people pyke thanckes, haue oftentymes reiected y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rule of princes, haue disanulled law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es whiche abridged and restrayned the people of their wanton wyshes, with promising them to lyue as they lyste.</p>
            <p>None of them all dyd once open hys mouth,☞ or make any proffer to perswade the people.</p>
            <p>These men from true religion, haue fylched all feare, whiche might kepe menne within the lystes and bowndes of their dutye.</p>

            <p>Moreouer, all men may see that the profyte of wholsome repentaunce, is taken away, that the ardente loue of charitye is made key colde, when menne take this for a sure staffe to leane on, that their synnes be not forgeuen, for theyr mournynge, for their godly sorrowing, for any holy working, but rather that in so doing, they heape newe synnes vpon their olde.</p>
            <p>☞They take it to be a sinne to lament for their synne, and they holde that no good worke can be done without synne.</p>
            <p>What reason is it, that I for the synne which I dyd not of myne owne accorde (for I was constrained of necessity to do it) shoulde suffer euerlasting paynes? or what ryghte is there, that I shoulde be rewarded with euerlastinge ioy, for that fayth which I kepte onelye enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and spurred forwarde of god, without any wyll or diligence of my parte?

            <p>THus, reading M. Shacklockes tryumph in the behalfe of Osorius and other hys leaguelowlers, ioyned with so vniuersall disabling of all gospellers and namely D. Had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, I thought good to make this search, which I haue here set before all mennes eyes, takynge the beginning therof at Osorius his first propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition or entrance vnto his mattier, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuinge the chase vnto his pytyfull conclusion. Which collections runne so much on one figure called <hi>Rixa</hi> or <hi>Conuicium,</hi> &amp; are such declama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie and generall stuffe, that a man maye trulye say, they haue one especial property, that is, they may serue more martyrs then one. For euen so, as he in these his centons or fragmentes impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth our religion, might he thunder against He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rostrotus for burning the Temple of <hi>Diana,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen so against the wilfull murther of Orestes, Nero, Mithridates, Cambises: euen so against the sensualitye of Xerxes or Sardanapalus: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst whom and what he pleased, euen so. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that in diuers places he merueilously mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taketh our doctrine, beating downe manfullye that we neuer set vppe, like a counterfeyt <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules,</hi> making monsters vnto him selfe whiche

he may easely vanquish, and so losynge his dayes labour to the greate pitie and compassion of the godly reader. thus much (and what so euer elles) whether it may bee trulye saide or no, let other men iudge. This I dare depose, that there is not halfe so much here vttered, as is forced by thim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of his <hi>Subscriptor</hi> M. Shacklock.

You are (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse) in wordes and sentences a lykely workeman, and thervpon haue presumed accordyngly, that you a pryuate man, disneighbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from vs by sea and lande, &amp; in our affayres vnacqueynted, haue so homelily opened your mouthe
<pb facs="tcp:12774:21"/>
vnto the Quenes highnes, strey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the aucthoritie of our lawes, &amp; charged our whole realme with a certaine vngodly &amp; lothed new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Wherfore you must of reason pardon mee, that I an Englishe man borne, one of the quenes ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>iesties suppliauntes, &amp; enfourmed in my countrie fashions, do make you aunswere, and vse my penne somwhat franckely, not so muche vpon an angry pange, or a bytter contentious harte, as to correcte this your mistaki<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g of the englishe state, spro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge of false surmises, and to restore the truethe vnto them, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> peraduenture this your let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath peruerted. And to geue you plaine vnderstanding that I am not blowen vppe with anger, but of duetie moued, I confesse

your kynd of writing worthy sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation, and besydes gyue you thankes that (beyng so well endewed) you haue extolled our renowmed Quene, whose ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie althoughe it farre sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount the heapes of your praise, yet a forraine testymonie beauty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with eloquence, no doubte is very plausible.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of knowledge, &amp; reason deepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the choyse of Religion, but sir, in both you haue a foule fault, that is, ouercharging &amp; beatinge our eares with thynges vulgare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowne, and plentie of proofes where no doubt is. This waye fyrst taken, your penne by stealthe crepeth on to the purpose, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:12774:22"/>
to rifle such religion as (by your saying) we haue receyued. And, lo, howe in the very entrance you wittingely trippe, or rather take a cleane fall throughe grosse ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of our English customes, fatherynge vpon the multitude &amp; common people the ratefyinge of our Religion authorised by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like decree, and feyning the exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Royall estate from af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres of the Churche.

any man haue whispered in your eare, then are you both in faulte, he for his lowde lye, and you for swift credit. But if you haue buil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded this out of your own braine, to disfygure our lawes as rawe &amp; halting, inuented of peasauntes, I may saye it was doone of small curtesie, before you haue geuen vs halfe a tast of your matter, to blow out vpon our englishe law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es so heynous a slaunder. Then followeth a weyghty and strong supplication to the quenes grace, that if you can by sounde reason and open profe lay before hereies in religion what is pure &amp; vnlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uened, that then her grace wolde not be so stif and vnmoueable, but yelde her selfe, acknowledge the blasing light of the trueth, and be

You step in with a deadly complaint, exag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerate with most select and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wordes, how certaine routes
<pb facs="tcp:12774:23"/>
of men (God knoweth who, and where they be) haue reuolted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the apostolike trueth, and fetched in a newe fayth, a straunger vnto vs, craking of lybertie, yea suche a one, as is moste pestilente, swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with the waues of mischifes out of all number. Then fall you vppon the authours therof, ouer whom you thunder and lyghten with suche thicke flasshes &amp; taun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting terrible clappes, as though they were in earthe of all other most detestable. Where are these your monstrous babes of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? whiche be they? howe longe haue they contynued? or howe might I come to the knowledge of them: where are such wonders to be founde vnder the shape of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? what do they, how do they?
<pb facs="tcp:12774:24"/>
howe did you fyrst knowe them? Certifie vs of the thinges, pointe to the persons, subscribe the time leaue not out one circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stance, that we maye haue some sure grounde to pitche vpon, and so to susteine your encountringe. You hallowe as loude as you can againste reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with her capitaines you will fyghte, you speake bitterly vnto both, and are content to shew vs neither of them, what it is, wher it is. This your accusation is to be pitied, which if I dashe in the teethe with one contrary worde, must nedes commend it felfe vnto silence. You crye, naye you make an outcrie, and that ful ruthfully, that there is a fourine of religion newely admitted, accursable, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable, abhominable, whose au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours
<pb facs="tcp:12774:24"/>
are vnhallowed persons, ruffyans, sorcerers, vndoers of common wealthes, and professed enemyes of mankynde. I on tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther syde do depose that there is nothinge lesse, I credite you not, I demaunde your proofe. Nowe what saye you? what proue you? You crye with open mouth, there is no wyckednes but you haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> termes of it, which (I smell) you had gathered together, therwith to deface your imagined Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and to wounde suche persons as no man knowethe but your selfe. Nowe surely, to disquiete with suche chaunge of tauntes, euen to the princes face, the most famous Isle in Christendome, to you vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne, vpon the false ianglyng either of our ilwillers or your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasites,

and not to determine ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the cryme or persons, argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in a man small aduisemente, &amp; foule mispending of time in bely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge of other. But to go further: you terme this our Secte by the name of a people pleaser, cauilling that they do not subdue vices, but set men on fyre with sensualitie, yea with madnes, and that there are examples enough of their sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerie and treason against princes. A horrible allegation, yea a dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable kinde of men, if there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny suche liuinge. If there be no such at all, then great is the rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of thaccuser, in an estate whol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>somly setled, to rayse suche vppe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rores. Mary (to speake a trueth) now that you haue vncouered vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to mee this platte of poysoninge
<pb facs="tcp:12774:25"/>
and conspiracies, looking a lyttle backe vnto the recordes and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories of our predecessours, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne to call to mynde Henry the fourth of that name, Emperour, vnto whom a Moncke of mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous and wicked monckysh cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie, euen in their late godefyed Eucharist ministred poison, wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vpon he died, and whose counsell was intermedled herein, the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories do tell. By the lyke accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed enterpryse of the like ghostlye person, was king Iohn of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande murthered, as our Crony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles do testifie. But to sticke in the recitall of particulers, especiallye vnto you, is nedeles, who borde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynge nearer vpon such practises then I, maye of likelyhod, with more speede learne out of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisters
<pb facs="tcp:12774:26"/>
of your neere neighbours, what poysoned drafts haue wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked too and fro, betwene the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural demigods and proude patrones of the Romish churche, and howe or by whom the pryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cypall seede of warres haue bene sowen throughout all Realmes christened. But I wil not procede in accusatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s as you doe, nor vrge you with suspicions, but in moste humble sort wyll lift vp my han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des vnto the euerliuing god, sou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge out vnto hym all thankes possible, that hath vouchesafed to putte a side the depe mistes of the former tymes, with the sonn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyght of hys gospell rysen vppe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs, through thignoraunce whereof, and former affiaunce in blinde superstition we wallowed
<pb facs="tcp:12774:26"/>
in the syncke of synne wythout any remorse, thinkynge all to be raunsomed, what so euer we did in our lyfe wickedlye, by a leaden charter of popish pardon, and the muttringe of prayers whiche we vnderstoode not. Then came the authoritye of the holy scriptures, thundrynge at the doore of oure eares, and sente into our conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces such shiuering and feare, that nowe we fixe our whole trust and ankerholde in the free mercye of God, all humaine inuentions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected and set a part, alwaies ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge an eye to the counsell of the Prophete, to fashyon &amp; shape our conuersation vnto holynesse and righteousnes. Whiche being so, I meruaile what should be thende of your tedious discourse vnto the

Queene wherein you wyshe all Prynces to prouide and to bee in continuall watche, least throughe this newe borne secte (not yet by you well expressed) they treade a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wry. Doubt you not but that our Royall Queene is surely enough planted in al prosperity, &amp; louyng her people is eftsones loued, fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge not one breath of these stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes which you harp vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon welthes haue taken their rest, and presentlye I truste are in quiet. I knowe nothing vnto the contrary, vnlesse you obiecte the late broyle in Fraunce, whiche now is appeased, and whence the firste blaste thereof came it is a thinge sone toulde. but sithe you name nothing, let it goe. There ensueth in your treatise a vulgare
<pb facs="tcp:12774:27"/>
and olde beaten quarrell of the frailetie of this present lyfe, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che your aduise is to contempne, &amp; to make a way vp into heauen, to set the world farre from vs, to thende we may attaine vnto euer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lasting felicitie. Then fall you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to admiratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that herein we wil cleaue vnto newe shepeheardes, where as in your mynd, the olde may suffice. yet are you contente to suspende your verdicte, &amp; that inquiraunce be made of our grene Pastors newely chopped in, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che wil in no wise be cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fangled, taking vppon them (the schooleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s drowsy dregges wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped away) to scoure &amp; clense the Churche, and to trymme it vppe according to thinstitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, so to represente vnto all
<pb facs="tcp:12774:28"/>
Christendom the veritie founded in the gospel of Iesus Christ, this longe tyme ouermaistered by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetise and ambitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to blase with the starry brightnes of holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture gods glory so darkned with mannes dreames and fansies, to vndoe the yoke of superstition, &amp; fynally to reedifie the sincere wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>shyp of god after thauncient rule &amp; discipline of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> primitiue church. These mennes profession you so well lyke, that you loute &amp; scorne their enterpryse: these be they whom you vex and tosse at wyll, one while scoffing, another while fuming, nowe cryinge, and then yellyng out. Very well. Now at length I see what new secte you meane, againste whom you haue so busylye discharged and let flye
<pb facs="tcp:12774:28"/>
all this eloquence. I haue nowe espied your aduersaries, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you must needes haue pruned of, and cast on the dounghill, as the very poyson of a common wealth. Me thinckes on the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary side, that these preachers of the gospell are the seruantes of the hyghest god, sent euen of God him self, to quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken our assedlike slouth in these slyppery tymes and latter cast of the world, to spurre our loytring, to refute our falshode, &amp; to checke and taunte our wickednes. And therfore such men ought to be ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched out of the prynce, and had in estimation througheout the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth. Se what differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is betwene your opinion &amp; myne. Wherfore we must march on, and consyder what you, (a graunde
<pb facs="tcp:12774:29"/>
doctour for a prynce forsothe) can eyther alledge truely, or vntruely forge against gods reuerende mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters and seruauntes. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though (as it may be,) this slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der procede of some other: yet shal you beare double blame for rashe credite, and more rash puttyng of the same in wrytyng. I wyll not trauise all the corners of your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation, which almost powreth out nothinge but an vnfruitefull ringing in peinted wordes. One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I wyll runne ouer your chiefe pointes, and, if I be able, shake the verie pillers of this your accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation. Fyrst you say there muste be note taken of the persones, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they promise franckely, and tryall made what their habilitie is, what pith they haue, what is
<pb facs="tcp:12774:29"/>
their vertue and integritie of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge. Then you demaund whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in godly life they be more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute then Athanasius, Basill, Ambrose, Hierome, &amp; Augustin weare. I wis there are many of them of incomparable learnynge and most godly demeanour, and I see nothynge you brynge, why they may not be equal with these auncient sages. But to bring you out of your odyous comparisons, me thincke you moue an vnreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable question in an vnfyt place. For I auouch that these our prea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chers whollie agree with those reuerende fathers, treade in the same pathe, and exhibite all one tenour of Religion. If this be so, then make you a vaine compary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son betweene them that be fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
<pb facs="tcp:12774:30"/>
if it be otherwise, enfourme vs wherin they disagree. S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth that his time was so drowned with flouddes of cere<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>monies, that christians were the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in worse case the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were the iewes before them. Saincte Hierome wyssheth that the sacred scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, whiche were in your churche so locked vp &amp; smoothered, should be learned by harte both of weo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and children. S. Basill em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed all possible leysure vppon that good worke of learning and also teachinge the gospell. And if the pampered Monckes of oure tyme had lyued in sainct Basiles order, they had not ben once tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched. Athanasius his creede stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in ful estimation, &amp; betwene hym and our men no squarynge.
<pb facs="tcp:12774:30"/>
But I thincke I maye be boulde to kepe these our auncients in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence, vntyll you brynge contra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry euidence. Of those auncient fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the churche, seinge your selfe able to bringe nothinge but their naked names, remembryng your self, you passe ouer vnto the men of our age, and leaping firste vpon Luther, you teare the dead man in pieces, firste callyng hym blinde hassard, then a people plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ser, &amp; last (for your pleasure) starck staring madde. This man of god whom you so falselie charge with frenseie, in open auditorie and in presence of Charles themperour, exhibited a sober &amp; discrete soome of his faithe. This franticke fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe in spite of all the wyseste of your Churche, stoode all salfe and
<pb facs="tcp:12774:31"/>
haile the space of .xxx. yeere, they notwithstanding all raginge and cauing for his deathe. Erasmus giueth this lunatike man no base record of innocencie in these wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des: Luthers doctrine many doe defame, his life al men extol with one consent. You say moreouer he was popular. How expound ye that? If you call hym popular that carketh &amp; careth for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples health, then no man is more. If you meane a prycker of rashe lightnes amonge the communal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, reade his booke wherein he controuleth and taunteth the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rores in Germanie, &amp; leaue your slaundering. And that men may not thincke you haue played this naughtie parte onely in Luther, you recite other as though, after
<pb facs="tcp:12774:31"/>
you haue spoken the worde, they were straighte way transformed out of pereles godly me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into most vyle vyllaines. Emong other I wil name you two principall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessours of the gospell, Martine Bucer, and Peter Martyr, which of goddes good gyfte, arryued in this Ilande: Let all our cankerd enemies laye together their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des. Let se what one thing euen malice it selfe can note in these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerend graues amisse. O golden couple of greyheadded fathers of most happye memorie, of whose learninge right good witnes we haue, euen the bookes by them compiled. whose pure conuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion so many commende, as euer happened into their company. Wherfore (if you be wise) temper
<pb facs="tcp:12774:32"/>
your tongue, and stay your style, and take heede of inconuenience. Deeme not them so largely to be presumptuous persons, vnaduy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and lofty, sithe there is a nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of theim well knowne, then whom nothing can be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, more milde, sober, and aduised. Two I haue named, the like testimony mighte I geue of whole hundre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes. But the sobre conuersation of two persons, bruted farre and nere, maye plentifullye refell one particular mans rash and shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les cauillation. Then againe you make transition vnto our mens doctrine, mislykinge therein that they vrge nothing but scripture, they call to counsaile nothing but the holy ghost, reiectynge and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoning all humaine authory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
<pb facs="tcp:12774:32"/>
who if they dyd as you saye, they shoulde therin treade in the very steps of our sauiour Christe, thapostels, and olde fathers that were in the infancy of the church. But it is farre otherwise. They do sorte and chuse out the asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of al approued interpretours of all ages, as declare their boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, whiche are able vnto all the worlde to detecte this your false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. You scoffe graciousely, and (in your own fansie) prosecute an inuincible reason against such per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fectnes of liuing, as our men take vpon them selues, which you say by their abhominatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is hourely reproued. Vntrue it is that they presume any iote beyonde manns strengthe, and thother is an olde slaunderous cast, to defame men,
<pb facs="tcp:12774:33"/>
not opening any one spot of theyr vncleannes. Name it if you can, what so euer it be, worthy this your stormie and veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t replie. If you can not, leaue for shame, so pestilently to tatle against the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of moste graue persons. You require to haue it specifyed, in what one pointe our men haue refourmed thestate of the church. I neede not tell you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you name enough your selfe, sauing that we differ in meaning. You laye vnto our charge that Nunnes &amp; Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes cloystered to attende the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God, &amp; to continue in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitie, are now let out and fully li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenced to all wyll: that their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laices are openly cried to sale, and howe lawes are come forth, that vnto luste there be no let in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
<pb facs="tcp:12774:33"/>
O hoorishe impudencie in lyeng, and wyll lawles beyonde measure. We graunte, and that freelie, that vpon aduertisement of our pastors, we let fal vnto the ground those dennes of stincking poyson, wherin were pestered vp young wenches and syllie boyes, to suche ruine of vertue in theim, as for shame I can not discouer. What was there in those shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full shoppes of synne, but onely a pharisaicall length of seruyce in a strau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge tongue? as for other their misteries they most liuelily resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled vnto vs the droncken hollie daies of Bacchus. Wherevppon God (no doubte) stirred vppe the mindes of our countrymen, that these infynite routes &amp; swarmes shrowdynge in secrete corners of
<pb facs="tcp:12774:34"/>
abhomination should be rowsed, by their exhortations, from slepe to worcke, from vice to vertue, &amp; from their horryble practyses of fornication vnto lawful wedlock. Not that we enioin any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>straint of maryage, but plucking our con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sience out of the yoke of mannes traditions, we restore the lyber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gospel, wherin the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of Iesus christ hath planted vs, by the warrant of his worde. Of their howses there were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed to good and godlye vse of scholes, vniuersities &amp; hospitals. with the reste lawfull order was taken, leste the swynishe genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion shoulde once agayne tumble in their durtie dunghilles. This was a worthy &amp; singular blessing of god, wherby there is more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridged
<pb facs="tcp:12774:34"/>
of the hellishe tyranny of Sathan, then by al your canons, layinge them all together. You weepe ouer the pluckinge downe of ymagerie and tableworke, whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che monumentes once displaced, you affirme that ther is nothing lefte to enflame our spirites vnto the contemplacion of heauenlye thinges. We on thother syde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring the grosse ignoraunce euen of late tymes, sorely mistrust dotage in idolatrie, agaynste the whiche there are playne textes, yea the gospel geueth vs a watch worde concerning ymages.

spirite, and that they stand in the right way of praier that worship in spirite and trwethe, and suche beadmen the Lord loueth. This is the moste wholesome waye of praying, if we consider eyther the originall or ende of it, which nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not thundersettinge of these outwarde ceremonial thinges, so to clime vppe vnto the throne of God the father. Nay while our outward Adam is to much occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied, about these superficial stuffe, the inward ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> waxeth keiecold, drincketh in the venemous ioice of a basterdlie Religion, forgoeth the sounde fruite of heauenly me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation. Let vs bind vp al with examples: The former auncient churche of apostles and martirs had none of these your costly iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elles,
<pb facs="tcp:12774:35"/>
&amp; yet was there most whot zeale burnynge in their breastes. In baser times of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by fote and foote in stepped peintrie, and so died in the former loue of gods seruice y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was so kendled in mens harts.

knowledge of god is in his worde, and sincere worshyppinge in spyrite. As for your pyctures, where the spyrite is present they neede not, where that wanteth they auayle not. It were a tedious matter for you to make of euery thyng a seuerall discourse, and therefore with one breath you say that all holly seruice, ceremonies, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes ar by vs cleane sacked and destroyed. What is it that I heare? Is there lyuing any such broode of diuynes, that spoyleth and destroyeth all holly seruice, al ceremonies, all sacramentes? Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is so, orels muste this bee, as it is in deed, a shameful excesse in lying. For forreine Churches I can gage nothinge, but I haue a good opinion of them? Of our
<pb facs="tcp:12774:37"/>
orders in diuine affayres I wyll make you a briefe acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt, not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fring you eyther to be ignoraunt youre selfe, or to bewytche other. First (bycause fayth commeth by hearing) we send into al coastes of the Realme Preachers to edifye the people in their duties toward God, and to enstructe them in the true worshipping of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue we an order of commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er collected out of Scriptures, by Parliament (for so we terme the consent of the three estates of our Realme) authorised, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che we suffer no man to wander, forseing (wyth all diligence) two pointes, fyrst the holy ghost to be obeyed, warning that whosoeuer open his mouth in the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, speake the worde of God, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
<pb facs="tcp:12774:38"/>
that in al things be found an vnity wythout dyscorde. The sacramentes we cause to be mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred very precisely after the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script of holy writ, and the liuely paterne of the former Churche, wherin the Lorde Iesus Christe first in his own person instituted them with his Apostles. And all these are propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vulgare toung, for that it is a brutish folly and plainly excepted in the testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the presence of God to clatter out that wee vnderstande not our selues. The geuing of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, hallowing of wedlock, chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of childwiues, visitynge of the feble, and burying of the dead corses, we execute with solemne and publike rites according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> veritye in the Gospell, whych we
<pb facs="tcp:12774:38"/>
spice with ceremonies so far forth as al things may procede in order and decently within oure Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as we are certainly aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed out of the gospel. Of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> times, places, dayes &amp; other circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, we haue made no alteration, neither in the whole body of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion innouated anye thing, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> eyther abhorred from all reason, or was stayned wyth open impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Thus haue I rypped vp vnto you the rites and manners of our Churche, whych you see is cleane strypped neyther of holy seruice, sacraments nor traditions, but of eche sort hath reserued so muche, that who so chargeth vs to bee voyde of all, wantinge in dede no parcell requisite vnto the peculier anauncement of Gods honor, shal
<pb facs="tcp:12774:39"/>
shal offer vs vnreasonable iniury. You saye we haue shyfted of the yoke of the imperial Bishop, and you saye well. It was to heauy and broosyng, for either vs or our fathers before vs, any lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine. Neither acknowledge we any one high superintendent, but only our lord Iesus Christ, which honor the scriptures assigne vnto him alone. And herein do we not part Christs coate (as you gesse) but wee touse and hale the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes gaberdine, neyther vnlocke we the doore vnto sedicion, but stoppe the hyghe waye, wherein vpon his lawlesse bulles of leade we rode stepe downe into perdici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. You rake together many vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and therof packe vp an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that in any wise there must
<pb facs="tcp:12774:39"/>
be in the Church one spiritual so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereigne or hyghe regent. What nedes that? sith euen in the soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest age of the Church there was one God, one fayth, and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding had Peter one pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uince, Paul another, and Iames another, and diuers other had se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall charge, whereas the seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s was no breach to the vnity in fayth. In sequele of time, diuerse prelates of Rome were holy Martirs, put to death by heathen Princes, vsurping no other crowne but the crowne of martirdome. As for this extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary popish regalty, they knew it not, and S. Gregorye by name doth defie it. Wherfore if the most floryshinge tyme of the Churche were voyde of thys your Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,
<pb facs="tcp:12774:40"/>
we also may wesleaue if out, nay we ought so to do, not onely for the streight charge of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but also the suggestion of all good reason. We cannot abide to haue the head so far distant from the body, especially hauinge thys souereigne power (for the which you labor so harde) here at home in England, that no nede it is to seke any abrode. We haue the full authority of a regall power, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyning the whole vertue of king lye iurisdiction ouer the whole Realme. But thys, this is it that you cry away withall, thys hath set you in such a glowinge, that vnto Princes you impute sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, bicause they extend their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritye ouer the Ecclesiasticall lawes, &amp; dare auenture to touche

Hieronimus, come out of thys traunce, fie vpon this impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience, in a professed wyse man, let in a littell breath, &amp; chere vp your spirites, you shall se al things in a cleare case. The Quenes maiesty reygneth ouer all her subiectes of Englande. And reason it is. So haue the Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>chmen theyr French king, and the Scottes their scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish souereigne. Yea, but she pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth in vnto church matters. Not a whytte. Al politike affayres, ar gouerned by ciuill magistrates, &amp; spiritual matters by bishops.

and not by the Romish de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, by whose Canons I heare say whole routes haue bene enri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, but a scle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der sort trayned to dread God rightlye.

Not knowing thys our cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, you bewayle the ruine and decay of the decrees, which (so far forth as they varie not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Gods worde) stand with vs in full ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and force.

sooth. If verye nature did teache the gentilles thys, then had you nede beinge a Christian, to looke with both eyes, what it is like a sycophant with scoffinge to try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph agaynst Chryst. But to the purpose, we are contente (wyth Sainct Paule) to build vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that liberty wherin Christ hath plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vs. And this libertye of the spirite we qualifye in suche sorte, that we make exception agaynste the libertye of the fleshe, as S. Paule againe teacheth. We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gospell, that euerlasting death is farre from them whych are graffed in Christe Iesus (ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge also that foloweth in the same treatise) whose walkinge is not after the fleshe, but after the spirite. I do not roue out of the

Let vs subscribe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, and in no wyse let vs dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate from the gospell one iot: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry this is to be learned out of the same leafe, by a lyuely and chary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table fayth. These two thus lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked together if we doe holde and maintaine, (as no doubte we do) you ought not to diuorse them, &amp; reply vppon a maisterles errour, which hath no Patrone except it be your selfe. It is no gentlemans practise (that I may vse the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of the Ciuill lawe) to catche thone ende of a statute, and there by to iudge the whole matter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:12774:44"/>Mangle not our doctrine thus, but repete it as it is. Which done, there shall ye see good worckes standing in their due reputation, &amp; store or graue exhortacions vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to penitence, and laste of all proue that (for lacke of an aduersarye) you haue made a verye wyse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicte with your owne shadowe. Forthe ye goe in your lycencyous stile, horriblye cryinge out, that through this dulnes, nai madnes of our men, all mannes reason is clogged and tied vp, free wil hath no scope nor liberty, and all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde made so bare and so blynd, that there is lyttle dyfference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene a man and a stone, that they make god thauthour of sinn, and bring al thinges to confusion and distemperaunce. Finally that
<pb facs="tcp:12774:45"/>
it argueth iniustice in god, to take vengeaunce of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whom he hym selfe hath depraued. Suerelie I doe not commonly yelde to any pange: But this once I must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des be bolde with you. You haue vttred not onely a dissardlye and vnskilful cauillation, but blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous withall, and suche one, as the very stones wherof you talk, if they coulde speake, woulde not cast out agaynste our preachers. Dippe your witt and vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge in a little scripture, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim your error. God the father chose vs in Christ before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the worlde were laid, that we might be hollie &amp; blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les in his sight. You heare recy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of the gospell this diuyne election, which you in wordes so
<pb facs="tcp:12774:45"/>
greuousely detest, and you heare the time also. Neither is that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny necessary fruite of thelectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to breake downe the pale vnto all lustes and abhomination (as you scoffe most vnreuerently) but to make vs appeare hollye and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible before the face of god by charitie, as is worde by worde expressed in the gospell. God it is that worketh in vs bothe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good will and the worke of good wyll. In fewe wordes hath S. Paule clogged and captyuated all our strength and power. How now? is there no difference betwene vs and stones or stockes. O headde made of a blocke that so woulde gather. S. Paule againe calleth vs ioynct workers with Chryste, and commaundeth vs to labour
<pb facs="tcp:12774:46"/>
about our owne sowles health in feare and tremblynge. Howe can that bee (wyll you saye) sithe we leaue all in gods handes: Learne howe in .iii. wordes. I can do all things in Christ which doth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie me. And S. Austine in other wordes compriseth the selfe same sentence very eloquentely. God crowneth in vs his own workes. Now sir. Marck ye well the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and twise holly purpose of god, surely fensed with the bulwarkes and rampiers of the Scripture? And can ye yet conceiue how we make the prouydence of God not the mother of synn, but the nurce of all obedience? Let vs haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course vnto the very fountaynes, whiche not withstandynge that they flowe w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> streames as sweete
<pb facs="tcp:12774:46"/>

And that I may haue ineuitable processe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst you, I will recite the very worde of the gospell. The chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren being yet vnborn, when they had done neyther good nor euyll, that the purpose of god by electy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on might stande, not by reason of their workes but by grace of the caller, it was saide, the elder shal serue the younger, as it is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

there any vnrightuousenes with god? that doth S. Paule defye, Hieronimus Ossorius will abyde by it. God by his owne mouthe saide vnto Moises: I wyll haue pitie vpon whosoeuer I take py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and wyll haue compassion v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon whom so euer I take compas<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Wherunto S. Paule addeth that it is neyther in mannes will nor cunning, but in the free mercy of God. and this doth he stablish with the example of Pharao, and maketh finall euidence, that god where he wyll taketh pitie, and whom he wyll he maketh harde harted. What saye we hereunto? forsothe we let downe the saile of our owne iudgement, and bowe vnto theternall prouidence of god lying so open in the scripture, and
<pb facs="tcp:12774:48"/>
taking S. Paules counsell by the way, remember that we are crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Neyther doe we chop lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gique with our creator, but walke in our vocation, betake our selues vnto our bounden duetie, day by daye craue with submission the grace of the hollie ghost, permytt the residue vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> botomles mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of god, &amp; in his misteries wade no further, then we haue placket. What saies Hieronimus Ossori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us? Suerly (saith he) if humaine reason be so clasped vp, al free de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation forspoken, and our wil hath from euerlasting bene gods prysoner, it must needes followe that the whole ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is cleane shri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of all iudgemente, yea of hys senses, that he is no better then a stone, yea god is made the author

Do I belie one sillable of your wordes, do I misalleage one heare? do ye recognise the words of your own lippes, other starke false orelles blasphemous? you are he, that proude pecocke, checkemate with god, whose sollen stomacke sainct Paule bitterly taunteth and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth down, you being but an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then vessell lately purtraited out of moulde and claye, wyll knowe of the potter to what vse he hath tempered you.

with freshe wordes, but all your puissau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce leaneth vnto olde &amp; stale vices, such as be common vnto all sortes of men. You chyde their pryde, you bid auaunt with their impudencie, you finde them giltie of robberies, poysonynges, high treason, you bring vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so long rowles of enditement as neuer did Cicero vpon Verres, &amp; in thend you frame a reason, that the good vertue of their doctrine sheweth it selfe vnto all mennes eyes in their execrable conuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For (say you) of wholsome doctrine buddeth out amendme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of manners, whiche rule because now it faileth, this fruitles &amp; dry diuinitie of right shoulde be roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out. False is this your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption of their loose liuynge,
<pb facs="tcp:12774:51"/>
whiche if it were true, yet should it neuer be gathered of your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses. There hath euer ben dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel mingled with the wheate, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was there seede sowen but it hath had dyuerse successe, some choked vppe with thornes, some parched with the heate of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> son. The Prophetes were gaine saide by false prophetes. Our sauyour Iesus Christ founde a cruel Cay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas. the apostles were neuer free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the tyranny of Nero, no more were the Martyrs of latter yeres salf from deuilishe Decians. But these proofes are too auncyente. Com home I pray you vnto your owne church. In your own chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is there not trippinge co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? Nay is there not frailtie open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie? yes, (saye you,) then, say I,
<pb facs="tcp:12774:52"/>
repeate your owne reasons, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch are either as weake as water, orels preiudiciall vnto your selfe, and your pretensed church. This thus agreed on, if you aske where is the perfection of Aungelles, if you exact innocencie as white as snowe, in vaine seeke you in this vale of myserie, the spirite with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fleshe. But if you wyll stand to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parison of the lyuinge of our men and yours, or way their learning and knowledg in equall ballances, wee are at your becke, go too, compare theim from the toppe vnto the toe. And for a brea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing while charme your tau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting tongue, so like a wanton lauyshe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge braineles brawles, dumme &amp; mum in graue argument, nothing tastinge of Scriptures, not ones
<pb facs="tcp:12774:52"/>
smellyng of doctours, onely run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge in mayne streames of reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable good wordes, but of sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious pithines welnigh destitute. Of the same stampe is that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of yours, which you haue so curiously framed. On the one side wherof you recken vppe in a rancke thapostles, whose renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vertue and doctrine (as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is) you haue garnyshed with pretie pearles of wordes and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences. On the other syde haue you placed our spiritualtie, whose outragious naughtines you curse as lowe as hell pitt. Which pein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted pageauntes of your eloquence (had you ben as wyse as you are taken) you shoulde haue hurded vpp vntill some other seasonable weather, for at this presente you
<pb facs="tcp:12774:53"/>
haue lost a fayre long tale. As for vs althoughe we maye without pricke of conscience affirme that the doctrine of our churche com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth lineally from the apostles, and also the scryptures beare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde that thapostles them selues sometimes stombled, and shewed theim selues to be but men, yet graunte we that in eche respecte they farre ouerwent the common frailtie of mannes nature. They were scholemasters picked out by gods owne wysedome, they had our sauiour Christ amonge them euen in their dayly conuersation, they were first possessed of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ghoste, and therefore are theyr names vnto vs as names of dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie and reputation. Come vnto latter tymes, one degree lower.
<pb facs="tcp:12774:53"/>
Let your churche shewe her face, and there let truthe trye whether of bothe is neerer cosyn vnto the apostles churche, be it for integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of lyfe or doctrine. This bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine made, we wyll forthwith, sewe our processe w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in geue you a large lice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to make the rewes of your comparisons (if ye will) one hundreth folde. But I auaile not, I find you nothing reasonable, you die if you be bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red bytyng and backbityng, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiously stretching your wynde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipe against our gospellynge, and therein settinge abroche all your sower eloquence. Storme vntyll you stare, crie out while your iaw<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>es wyll holde, yet shal you not by importunitie proue any other sede sowen by our preachers, saue one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:12774:54"/>
the liuely auncient and syncere gospell. In the whiche poynt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept your Romishe See bethinke it selfe, by calamitie and fatall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation it shall once learne, at the time when we shal all appeare at the dreadful assise of gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; in our owne person geue an heauie accompte of our fayth, not out of decrees or decretalles, which be your owne sweete dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linges, neyther oute of Iulius or Bonifacius his popishe pedlerye, (whose autoritie so pleaseth you) but euen oute of this golden gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, which you so sawcely deride, whiche you so longe whyle peste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in your darke dungeons, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is by gods good inspiration, &amp; the chiualrie of our souldiours restored againe vnto all Chrysten
<pb facs="tcp:12774:54"/>
Realmes. At that dolefull daye what wil betide you, which haue set your teeth so deepe in vs, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che haue laide violent holde vpon the Prophet Ieremie, &amp; by force of armes, after much strugglynge and kicking, brought him to geue euidence against our men. Let vs here that man of god whom you haue cyted, and vpon his prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie examine the truethe: beware, saith he, how you geue care vnto Prophetes preaching pleasaunte thinges and beguiling you, vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the fansie of their own hart, and not brynginge their message from goddes mouthe, for so they speake which dyshonor me, peace shalbe with you, and vnto those which walke after their own har<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes lusts, they haue said, no harm
<pb facs="tcp:12774:55"/>
shall befall you. Here you triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ph like a conqueroure, here you crye we are taken halfe oute halfe in. And I crye againe as loude that herein your visardes are pulled of your faces, and how it may so be, I will discrie it to all the worlde. In your temples reignethe this reastie peace, in your synagoges, and in none elles, encampeth and kepeth sleeping holliday this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelishe drowsynge, wherein you haue so hushed and rocked vp all other, and then layde your selues downe by them, that neyther you see the poynt of the sword leueled at your owne harte, neyther crye vnto other to eschewe the deadly stroke. The office of publike prea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chinge, so straightly requyred in the gospell, you haue wholly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed
<pb facs="tcp:12774:55"/>
to certaine silly &amp; fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les fryers, who on prescript daies declaime within their compasse, further forth they speake not one word. In their exhortatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s they vse suche a lengthe, with so small suite and chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, that they much sooner seale vp their eyes whiche be wakinge, then styrre theim vp that are on sleepe. O how quyet they be at their seruice and sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes. Firste the people muste stand without the rayles of their roodeloftes, then syr priest whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth vppe all in a tongue that no man vnderstandeth. Howe shall the people knowe to addresse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues to battaile, when no man knoweth the sound of the trump. These are the wordes of s. Paul. Looke vnto the masse, that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb facs="tcp:12774:56"/>
&amp; sweete marrowe of all your hollines. No man hath any part in that playe but the priest, as for the poore people they may see for their loue. The Scripture doth not there ouercharge any manne wyth hearynge, but husheth on sleepe all hir exhortations. Ones in a yeare is the lordes supper ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated, wel censed with ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, God knoweth wyth what troubled conscience. And there lac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>keth one chyefe point which chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes institution requireth, namely that hys death shoulde be had in remembraunce vntill his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What maladyes of synne soeuer haue poysoned your foldes, you apply no open soul sa<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>e Priuate satisfaction is made by whispe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe in the priestes eare, and if it
<pb facs="tcp:12774:56"/>
be more then a veniall trespasse, the popes leade<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bul must be way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed downe with siluer. Of ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies there are so many, so sutable, so pompouse shewes, that to the outwarde manne there can be no suche paradise, but for the sowles slender edefyinge, nay nothinge but staruinge cheare. Thus are your hollye orders displayed and layed open. Nowe may it please you to heare ours. Fyrste haue we according to the very veine of the gospell dayly preachinges, whose authority eyther with the threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and menacynges of the lawe breaketh our stubburne synnefull harts, or for the precious treasure of gods promises, doth allure vs vnto vertue. Which if any lewde personnes more rechles then the

rest, do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temne or set light by, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth the Magistrate by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>straint driue vnto diuine seruice, there to attend, not vnto mannes glosses, but vnto the certein voyce of god the father &amp; our Sauiour Christ, one whyle terrefying vs and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in feare the vyle leprousye of our synfull fleshe, another whyle spreading vpen vnto vs the wide gates of mercy. Here vnto are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded so many Psalmes &amp; Himnes, and such variety of readinges out of both Testamentes, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer among so heauenly peales of solace &amp; comfort, cannot conuey awaye one lyne for his owne lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, is to be thought of all other most vnhappy. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> followeth the last supper of our lord, of most wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thy &amp; vnspeakeable reuerence, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:12774:57"/>
no festiuall daye excluded. There doth the minister wyth an audy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble voice cal forth al such as haue deuoutlye prepared theym selues vnto so heauenly a Table. Forth come the therunto minded, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blinge them selues on their knees seuerally, in the face of the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and at a moment by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke confession renownce all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlie wayes, &amp; in vnity of praier betake theim selues vnto goddes mercy. The minister pronounceth vnto them certeine principall and chosen sentences of scrypture, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shootinge at them the thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derboltes of goddes vengeaunce for their polluted wayes, or ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the flowinge fountaynes of goddes clemencye, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municantes of that heauenlye ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb facs="tcp:12774:58"/>
maye oftentymes quake and tremble, and at the laste refreshed againe with hope of pardon, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue a sweete comforte. If there be any whose defamed lyfe maye shewe a perilous example of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialitye, or whose wickednes may no longer be borne, those doe we excommunicate, that shame and destitution maye reclayme theym vnto their duetye. Here haue I good occasion to frame a counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point, as you did before, which if I wold do, I could haue as good store of wordes to polishe and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourne the same. Lastlye I wolde moue a question whether of both diuine seruices more pricketh and galleth all wickednesse. Where is that husshinge at open impietye, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the prophet speaketh of, where
<pb facs="tcp:12774:58"/>
is that depe silence &amp; mumming? and on thother side what galling is to be seene of polluted conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? with what nippinge wordes are they wounded vnto the hart? what percing sentences are there to stirre vp their slowe blouddes? But I wyll leaue all vndone, I haue profered a tast of the matter, let him be iudge that wyll. This (to conclude) I wyll be bolde to say, that in one assemble at the ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly Communion, there are deeper syghes &amp; sobbes, then in sixe hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth of your riotous Massinges. Wherfore it was labor more then neded, out of the Prophet once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to inculcate, that no earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man hath bene of gods counsel, that no man hath seene or harde hym open his mouth. But thys
<pb facs="tcp:12774:59"/>
pryde is a birde of your owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, as I declared before. you it is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> laboureth to be one of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des pryuie councellours. As for this controuersie, whether tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth his tale out of goddes booke, you or we, the lykelyhood surely enclineth to vs warde, which be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually serching and tourning the scrptures. Your champions waueringe with the wyndes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the wyde seas of glosses and interpretacions, and totterynge as it were in a slyppery grounde, walk in the wide deserts in great perill of loosing their way. Well ones againe you make bold with Ieremy, not permitting the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rende prophet to rest. First you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage these words of his: If they had walked in my wayes or had
<pb facs="tcp:12774:59"/>
declared my wil vnto my people, surely they had reuoked them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theyr euyll waies, and from their wicked ymaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. Very wel. Let vs begin with Ieremy, who was a famous Prophete, and no man wyll say the contrarye. Did he scare all the Iewes from their vyces: did he bowe theyr backes, and winne them all vnto vertue? wey and consider the whole time of his prophecienge, and ponder wythal the mourneful gronings and wailing of his lamentacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. with the forechose<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> people of god, this man of god easely preuailed, (for my shepe here my voyce saith the gospel) as for the residue they were hardened. Dyd not Paule proue the like in the Romains &amp; the Corinthians? Peter in the
<pb facs="tcp:12774:60"/>
churches of Asia, and our Sauy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chryst in infynite numbers of the Iewes, and namely in the Capernaites? Wherfore let Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my goe, and leaue youre trifling. Paul planteth, Apollo watreth, but God geueth thencrease. And (as s. Paul witnesseth) this shal be an infallyble rule: God kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth hys owne. We must labour wyth all intent, but what good gyfte so euer befalleth vs, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from aboue, and desce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth downe vnto vs, from the father and god of light. But you still fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe the chase, inculcating the lewdnesse vnmeasurable of oure men, that is, you inculcate youre owne cankred charitye, and that whyche hath done you so muche good seruice in this Epistle, a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guler
<pb facs="tcp:12774:60"/>
sprite of slaundering. I say slaundering, sythe the most part of our men walketh in most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect wayes, and associateth vnto the true worshypping of god ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thousa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, &amp; as much abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that accursed conuersatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of you pretended, as thys your talk is void of all shame and modesty. And if you wyl do that is chiefly to be done, conferre w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the light of our gospell the palpable mistes of your times, and consider what difference there is. Youre last be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuolence is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our whole co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy swimmeth in sectes, &amp; hath made vnlawfull conspiracies to pull in peces all due worshipping of God. But notwythstandinge your cauil, they are linked in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect vnity, whych if you doubt, I
<pb facs="tcp:12774:61"/>
betake you vnto thapologie set foorth in the face of all Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as an open and vndoubted pledge of our Religion, disgrace it if you can. But you can not for your lyfe, nor any of all your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices and adherents, howsoeuer within these few daies one good man hath made hys barkynge brags. Our men (God wotteth) entend no ouerthrow of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, beleuing certainly in thimmorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytie of our soules. If there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny realme christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not throughly persuaded therin, turne your tale vnto them: and if ye be not thus satysfied, call to minde that oure men haue geuen earneste of their profession, not alonely with their tongues and pens, but wyth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yle, nakednesse, pyning, yea wyth
<pb facs="tcp:12774:61"/>
spe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding their bloud &amp; life. Which suerly they wold not haue done, if the grim terrors of this present lyfe could haue foyled theym, or crased their constancye in maine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining the knowen trueth. But you say you haue made lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you minded. Yea truly much longer then beseemed you, especially in the heari<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g of a most learned and prudent Pryncesse. Whose subtilitye in iudgement might haue put you in some ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest feare if you had considered y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground of her good gifts. Whose highnes continually is addict vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to the reading of scriptures, the comparyng of the most approued expositors, &amp; drawyng out of the opinions of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> best deuines, whose grace hath atteyned an excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb facs="tcp:12774:62"/>
in the tounges, ioygned wyth readines and quicknes of reason, &amp; all thys she so gouerneth with Princely wisdom, as in a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vneth is credible. She gladly fre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quenteth publique sermons &amp; by continual reading &amp; hearing is so wel applied, that her grace is no lesse able to instructe you then she nedeth your instructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Were you euer in hope that such a princesse, of al other most godly &amp; prudent, might by your smooth tale be cor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rupted, or with sugred words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled? It is nothing so, it is far otherwise, &amp; they haue fowly abu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sed this your kindnes, whosoeuer se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t you in for an ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> accuser, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially vnto the queenes presens. But now haue at your conclusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wherin I thinke you wyll neuer
<pb facs="tcp:12774:62"/>
conclude anye thing. One flinge more you must haue at the fruits of our doctrine. As for the perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s themselues, those you require to be loked on, and bi them must the religion be valued. What fruites (in Goddes name) misseth youre church in vs, that sinagoge of all other most fruitelesse. But we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse no chale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, your wil be done. Compare England in what case it nowe is, feeding on the sweete Mannah of Gods worde, wyth that whych was so monstruous to behold before, wyth ougly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formityes of humain tradicions. Let vs serch the chronicles, let vs discusse y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Chronographie of our times, let the Quenes hyghnesse sit in iudgement, and, conferring both tymes, geue sentence accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinglye.
<pb facs="tcp:12774:63"/>
This offer if you refuse, then learne at my handes the pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sent estate of Englande, and here after seale vppe your eares at the vnhonest babling of our enemies. A Princesse we haue of absolute power royal, in al pointes incom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>parable. Whose court is destitute of no ornament, touchinge either the honor of thestate souereigne, or the saulfegarde of the common wealth. The Archbishops &amp; Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops in their owne persons per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourme the offyce of preaching, &amp; laye theyr owne handes vnto the gouernement of their Churches, alway reside<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in them. No vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is ther among the nobility, no breache of dutye in subiectes, peace and tranquillitye through out the whole Realme. In these
<pb facs="tcp:12774:63"/>
things perchaunce you haue ben misenfourmed. But your fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero putteth you in minde, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man speaketh hys pleasure, but nedeles it is to credit euerye man. These our fell frendes loue well to blowe out not that they knowe to bee true, but that they wish to be true, bicause our good successe and felicity is vnto them a grieuous eyesore. Therfore syr, cheare your selfe, and set a parte thys sorrow so depely prynted in you brest for our sake. Take hede you stryde not out of all pacience, cast not your selfe down I say. If all be well in Portugall, care not for Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. But it is no meruail that you take these paines, syth we are of alyaunce and kynred. Surelye what knot of kinred so
<pb facs="tcp:12774:64"/>
euer is betwene oure kingdome and yours we gladly embrace it, and desier hartilye to be nearer cosins, knit euen in an heauenlye league. But (I pray you sir) if we be so deare friendes, as you saye, and I beleue you, what toye of frendship is it, thus vnto the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry crowne to heape vs vp with accusatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. How dare ye say that through vs men are diuorced fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that ryght auncient &amp; pure religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which was ratifyed by christs bloudeshed &amp; euer sence hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued vntill these dayes, and led aside vnto an other kinde of rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion both execrable and horrible. Do you thinke as you say? wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubte you doe not. For in those auncient and flourishing ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes their was no Papacy or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes
<pb facs="tcp:12774:64"/>
holynes, no leaden graces, no purgatory martes, no worshippi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g of Images, no gadding pilgrima<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges, no sacrifyces for the quicke &amp; the dead in Masses, nor any such trumpery. These misshapes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion what tyme they spronge, &amp; who begat them you cannot but knowe, but that you dissemble &amp; speake to please. Therefore not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstandinge the terrours that you thu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der in the Quenes eares, wyth commemorations of Gods maiestye &amp; the latter iudgement, your long tale so inflammed with fierye wordes, hath not thautho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritye that followeth truth and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacye. For why? into a malicious harte entreth no wisdome. As for your malice how sauage it is and hartbent, it is euident not onelye

Wherfore in my mind (good may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Hierome) you may do muche better in these religious matters, to see what diuynes can doe, and to take vppe your place againe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge Philosophers &amp; oratours,
