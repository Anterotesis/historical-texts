            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60237:3"/>
praiſed and renowned be his holy Power and Arm, by which he hath reached unto us, and brought Salvation near us: For he hath ſound us out, and hath heard our ſolitary Cryes, the deep and mournful <hi>Supplications of our bowed Spirits,</hi> when we were as the little filly Dove without its Mate, and the lonely Pelican in the Wilderneſs; when we were ready to cry out, <hi>Is there none to ſave, is there none to help! O when ſhall the Time and Times and Half a Time be finisht! when ſhall the One Thouſand, Two Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and Sixty Days be accompliſht! and when ſhall the Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that ſtands in the Holy Place, be caſt out! when ſhall the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity of the People be turned back!

And when ſhall the Law go forth out of</hi> Sion, <hi>and the VVord of the Lord out of</hi> Jeruſalem! <hi>VVhen ſhall</hi> Sion <hi>become the Joy, and</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>the Praiſe of the whole Earth! And when ſhall the Earth be covered with the Knowledge of the Lord, as the VVaters cover the Sea!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friends,</hi> The Lord of Heaven and Earth hath heard our Cryes, and the full time is come, yea, the appointed time is come, and the Voice of the Eternal Spirit in our Hearts hath been heard on this wiſe many a time, <hi>Awake thou that ſleepeſt, and I will give thee Life: ariſe out of the Duſt, and ſhine; for thy Light is come, and the Glory of the Lord is riſen upon thee.</hi> And the Lord God hath given us that Light by which we have comprehended the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in our ſelves and in the world: and as we have believed in it, dwelt in it, and walked in it, we have received Power to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Evil one in all his Appearances in our ſelves; and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully &amp; boldly to teſtifie againſt him in the World. And the Blood of Jeſus in this holy way of the Light have we felt in our Souls, to cleanſe us from Unrighteouſneſs; and given us to know the Myſtery of the Fellowſhip of the Goſpel one with another, which ſtands in Life and immortality. And here we become an <hi>holy houſhold</hi> and <hi>family unto God,</hi> that live in his Preſence Day and Night to do his Will, as becometh his redeemed and ranſomed Children by the moſt precious Blood of his Son, and no more to return to Folly.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Friends,</hi> Let it never paſs out of our Remembrance, <hi>what our God hath done for us, ſince he hath made us a People:</hi> Hath any
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60237:3"/>
Weapon formed againſt us, proſpered? hath he called us, and not protected us? hath he given Power to conceive, and not to bring forth? hath he not ſheltered us in many a ſtorm? did he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver leave us under the Reproaches and Contradictions of men? nay, hath he not ſpoken <hi>Peace</hi> to us? were we ever caſt out by men, and he forſook us? no, the Lord hath taken us up: were we ever in Priſon, and he viſited us not? hungry, and he fed us not? naked, and he cloathed us not? or have we been ſick, and he came not to ſee us? when were the Jayles ſo cloſe, that he could not come in? and the Dungeons ſo dark, that he cauſed not his Light to ſhine upon us? O nay; he hath never left us, nor forſaken us; yea, he hath provided richly for us; he hath brought us into the VVilderneſs, not to ſtarve us, but to try us; yet not above our meaſure: For he fed us with Manna from on high, with pure Honey and Water out of the Rock, and gave his good Spirit to ſuſtain us: By Night he was a Pillar of Fire to us, to comfort us; and by Day a Pillar of Cloude to hide and ſhelter us. He was the Shadow of a mighty Rock, that followed us; and we never wanted a Brook by the way to refreſh us. Was God good to <hi>Iſrael</hi> outward? much more hath he abounded to his ſpiritual <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the proper Seed and Off-ſpring of himſelf. O the noble Deeds and valiant Acts that he hath wrought in our day for our Deliverance! He hath cauſed One to chaſe Ten, and Ten an Hundred, and an Hundred a Thouſand many a Time. None hath been able to ſnatch us out of his Hands, who abode in his Truth. For though the Winds have blown, and the Sea hath raged, yet hath he rebuked the VVinds and the Sea for his Seed's ſake: he hath ſaid to the VVinds, <hi>Be ſtill:</hi> and to the Sea, <hi>Thus far ſhalt thou come, and no farther.</hi> He hath caſt up a high VVay for his Ranſomed to walk in, ſo plain, that though a Fool he ſhall not err therein. This is the Light, in which all Nations of them that are ſaved muſt walk for ever.</p>
            <p>And therefore, <hi>Friends,</hi> Let us ſtay our Minds in the Light of the Lord for ever; and let the Awe, Fear and Dread of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty dwell in us; and let his holy Spirit be known to be a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering to us, that from the ſpirit of this World we may be chaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kept and preſerved unto God, in the holy Light and ſelf-deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Life of Jeſus, who have offered up himſelf once for all, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60237:4"/>
us an Example, that we ſhould alſo follow his ſteps; that as he our dear Lord and Maſter, ſo we his ſervants and Friends and Children might by the eternal Spirit offer up our ſelves to God in Body, in Soul and in Spirit, which are his; that we may be his VVorkmanſhip, created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good VVorks, to the Praiſe of him that hath called us; which Calling is an high and an holy Calling by the eternal Light and Spirit in our Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. O that it might for ever remain in high Eſtemation with us; and that it may be the daily VVatch and Travel of us all, in the Preſence of the holy and Living God, that hath called us, to make our great Call and Election ſure, which many have neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do (who have been convinced by the bleſſed Light and Truth of Chriſt Jeſus revealed in their hearts, and who for a time have walked among us) have been overcome by the Spirit of this VVorld, and turned their hands from the Plough, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted the Camp of the Lord, and gone back into <hi>Egypt</hi> again, whereby the Heathens have blaſphemed, and the VVay and People of the Lord greatly have ſuffered.</p>
            <p>Therefore, O my dear Friends and Brethren, in the Senſe of that Life and Power, that God from Heaven ſo gloriouſly hath diſpenſed amongſt us, and by which he hath given us multiplyed Aſſurances of his Loving-kindneſs unto us, and Crowned us to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with heavenly Dominion, and in which my Spirit is at this time broken before the Lord, do I moſt earneſtly intreat you to watch continually, leſt any of you, that have taſted of the good VVord of God, and the Powers of the VVorld to come, fall by Temptation; and by Careleſneſs and Neglect tempt the living God to with-draw his fatherly Viſitation from any of you; and finally, to deſert ſuch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the Lord our God is a jealous God, and he will not give his Glory unto another. He hath given to Man all, but Man himſelf, and him he hath reſerved for his own peculiar Service, to build him up a glorious Temple to himſelf; ſo that we are bought with a Price, and we are not our own.</p>
            <p>Therefore let us continually watch, and ſtand in awe, that we grieve not his holy Spirit, nor turn his Grace into Wantonneſs: But all of us let us wait, and that in an holy travail of Spirit, to know our ſelves ſealed by the Spirit of Adoption, unto the Day of our compleat Redemption; when not only all our Sins; but
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60237:4"/>
all Sorrows, Sighings and Tears ſhall be wiped away from our Eyes; and Everlaſting Songs of Joy and Thankſgivings ſhall me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodiouſly fill our Hearts to God, that ſits upon the Throne, and to his bleſſed immaculate Lamb, who by his moſt precious Blood ſhall have compleatly redeemed us from the Earth, and written our Names in the Book of Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friends,</hi> The Spirit of the Lord hath often brought you into my Remembrance, ſince I have been in this deſolate Land, and with Joy unutterable have I had ſweet and precious Fellowſhip with you in the Faith of Jeſus, that overcometh the World: For, though abſent in Body, yet preſent in him that is Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent. And I can truly ſay, you are very near and very dear unto me; and the Love that God hath raiſed in my heart unto you, ſurpaſſes the Love of Women. And our Teſtimony, I am well ſatisfied, is ſealed up together. And I am well aſſured, that all that love the <hi>Light</hi> ſhall endure to the End throughout all Tribulations, and in the End obtain Eternal Salvation.</p>
            <p>And now, <hi>Friends,</hi> as I have been travailing in this dark and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Land, the great Work of the Lord in the Earth has been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten preſented unto my view, and the Day of the Lord hath been deeply upon me, and my Soul and Spirit hath frequently been poſſeſſed with an holy and weightly Concern for the Gloty of the Name of the Lord, and the ſpreading of his everlaſting Truth, and the Proſperity of it through all Nations, that the very Ends of the Earth may look to him, and may know Chriſt the Light to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to them for their Salvation: And when the ſenſe of theſe things hath been deeply upon me, an holy and ſtrong Cry God hath raiſed in my Soul to him, <hi>That we, who have known this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly Viſitation from on High, and who have beheld the Day of the Lord, the Riſing of the Sun of Righteouſneſs, who is full of Grace and full of Truth, and have beheld his Glory, and confeſſed it to be the Glory of the only begotten Son of God; and who by Obedience to his appearance are become the Children of Light, and of the Day, and as the Firſt Fruits to God after this long Night of Apoſtacy, might for ever walk and dwell in his holy Covenant, Chriſt Jeſus, the Light of the VVorld; becauſe in him we have alwayes Peace, but out of him comes all the Trouble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whilſt this heavenly Senſe reſted with me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <hi>Lord God,</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:60237:5"/>
that made me, and called me by his Grace unto Salvation, laid it upon me, to viſit you in an holy Exhortation. And it is the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation of my life at this time, in the earneſt and ſervent Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Power and Spirit of Jeſus, to beſeech you all, who are turned to the Light of Chriſt, that ſhineth in your hearts, and believe in it, That you carefully and faithfully walk in it, in the ſame Dread, Awe and Fear, in which you began; that that holy Poverty of Spirit, that is precious in the Eyes of the Lord, and was in the dayes of your firſt love, may dwell and reſt with you; that you may daily feel the ſame heavenly Hunger and Thirſt, the ſame Lowlineſs and Humility of Mind, the ſame Zeal and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, and the ſame Sincerity and Love unfeigned; that God may fill you out of his heavenly Treaſure with the Riches of Life, and crown you with holy Victory and Dominion over the god &amp; ſpirit of this World: That your <hi>Alpha</hi> may be your <hi>Omega,</hi> and your <hi>Author</hi> your <hi>Finiſher,</hi> and your <hi>firſt Love</hi> your <hi>laſt Love;</hi> that ſo none may make ſhipwrack of Faith, and of a good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, nor faint by the way. And as in this ſtate we are kept in holy Watchfulneſs to God, as in the beginning, the Table which our heavenly Father ſpreads, and the Bleſſings with which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſeth us about, ſhall not become a Snare unto us, nor ſhall we turn the <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Mercies</hi> of the Lord into Wantonneſs; but we ſhall eat and drink in an holy Fear, apparelour ſelves in Fear, buy and ſell in Fear, viſit one another in Fear; keep Meetings, and there wait upon the Lord in Fear: yea, whatſoever we take in hand to do, it ſhall be in the holy Fear of God, and with an holy Tenderneſs of his Glory, and Regard to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity of his Truth: yea we ſhall deny our ſelves not only in the unlawful things, but in the things that are even lawful to us, for the ſake of the many Millions that are unconverted to God.</p>
            <p>For my Friends and Brethren, God hath laid upon us (whom he hath honoured with the beginning of his great Work in the World) the care both of this Age, and of the Ages to come; that they may walk, as they have us for Examples, yea, the Lord God hath choſen you to place his Name in you; the Lord hath entruſted you with his Glory, that you might hold it forth to all Nations; and that the generations unborn may call you Bleſſed.</p>

               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:60237:5"/>
Therefore, let none be Treacherous to the Lord, nor reward him evil for good; nor betray his Cauſe directly by willful wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs nor indirectly by negligence, and unfaithfulneſs: But be zealous and valiant for Truth on Earth; let none be ſlothful, or careleſs: O remember the ſloathful Servants State: And let the loving-kindneſs of the Lord overcome every Soul to faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs; For with him are Riches and Honour, and every good thing, and whither ſhould any go? he hath the words of Eternal Life. O, let none looſe their Teſtimony, but hold it up for God; let thy gift be never ſo ſmall; thy Teſtimony never ſo little. Through thy whole Converſation bear it for God; and be true to what thou art Convinced of: And wait all upon the Lord, that you may grow in your heavenly Teſtimony; that Life may fill your Hearts, your Houſes, and your Meetings, that you may daily wait to know, and to receive Power to do the Will of God on Earth, as it is in Heaven.</p>
            <p>And O! that the Croſs of Jeſus may be in high and honourable Eſteem with every one; that the Liberty of all may ſtand in the Croſs, which alone Preſerveth; for it is the Power of God, that Crucifieth us to the world; and the world to us. And through Death, way is made unto Life and Immortality; which by this bleſſed Croſs, the Goſpel, the Power is brought to Light: So ſhall the Seed of Life that God hath ſown in our Hearts, grow; and in that Seed ſhall we all come to be bleſſed, unto whom God hath appointed the Dominion over us: and it is good for all to live under the Holy Government of it; for the ways of it are the ways of pleaſantneſs, and all its Paths are Peace, and all that are born of it, can ſay, <hi>Thy Scepter is a Scepter of Righteouſneſs.</hi> And, O! That all Friends every where, may continually bow unto his righteous Scepter, and keep to his holy Law, which is written in their Hearts; that it may be a Light to their Feet, and a Lanthorn to their Paths. So ſhall they come to witneſs that holy Promiſe made good unto them, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 59. <hi>That the Spirit, which I have given unto him, the verſ.</hi> 21. <hi>Seed; and the words, which I have put into his. Mouth, ſhall not depart from him, nor from his Seed, nor from his Seeds Seed unto all Generations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore Friends, redeem the time, becauſe the Dayes
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60237:6"/>
are Evil, God hath given you to ſee, they are ſo: and be ye ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated more and more, yea, perfectly diſentangled from the Cares of this World. And be ye not cumbred with the many things; but ſtand looſe from the things, that are ſeen, which are Temporal.</p>
            <p>And you, that are poor, murmur not; but be Patient, and truſt in the Lord, and ſubmit to his Providence, and he will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for you, that which is convenient for you, the days of your appointed time. And you that are Rich, keep in the moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſtrive not to multiply Earthly Treaſure, nor to heap up uncertain Riches to your ſelves; but what God hath given you more than what is convenient for your own Uſe; wait for his VViſdom, to employ it for his Glory; that you may be faithful Stewards of this worlds Mammon, &amp; the Lord God ſhall reward you into your Boſoms, of the riches of that Kingdom, that ſhall never have an end.</p>
            <p>O my Friends and Brethren, whether Rich or Poor, in Bonds, or at Liberty, in whatſoever ſtate you are; the Salutation of the univerſal Life of Jeſus is to you. And the Exhortation is, to bow to what is made known unto you; and in the Light, by which ye have received in meaſure the Knowledg of God, watch and wait diligently to the further Revelation of the Mind and Will of God unto you, that ye may be endued from on High with Power and Might in your inward Man, to anſwer the call and requirings of the Lord, that ye may be enabled to make known to the Nations, what is the Riches of the Glory of this bleſſed Myſtery in the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> which is Chriſt Jeſus the Light of the World in you the hope of glory. For this I have to tell you in the Viſion of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, that the Day of the breaking up of the Nations about you, and of the ſounding of the Goſpel-Trumpet unto the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Earth, is juſt at the door: And they that are worthy, who have kept their Habitation from the beginning; and have dwelt in the Unity of the Faith, that overcometh the world; and have kept the Bond of Peace: The Lord God will Impower and Spirit you to go forth with his Everlaſting Word and Teſtament to <hi>awaken, and gather Kindreds, Languages, and People to the Glory of the riſing of the</hi> Gentiles <hi>Light; who is God's Salvation unto the ends of the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I muſt tell you, that there is a Breathing, Hungring,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60237:6"/>
Seeking People, ſolitarily ſcattered up and down this great Land of <hi>Germany,</hi> where the Lord hath ſent me; and I believe it is the like in other Nations: And as the Lord hath laid it upon me with my Companions to ſeek ſome of them out; ſo have we found ſeveral in divers Places. And we have had many bleſſed Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities amongſt them, wherein our Hearts have greatly rejoyced; having been made deeply ſenſible of the love of God towards them, and of the great openneſs and tenderneſs of Spirit in them to receive the Teſtimony of Light and Life through us. And we have a ſtedfaſt belief, that the Lord will carry on his Work in this Land effectually; and that he will raiſe up thoſe, that ſhall be as Miniſters of his eternal Teſtament amongſt them. And O! our deſire is, that God would put it into the Hearts of many of his faithful Witneſſes, to viſit the Inhabitants of this Country, where God hath a great Seed of People to be gathered; that his work may go on in the Earth, till the whole Earth be filled with his Glory.</p>
            <p>And it is under the deep and weighty ſenſe of this approaching VVork, that the Lord God hath laid it upon me, to write to you to wait for the further powrings out of the Power and Spirit of the Lord; that nothing that is Careleſs, Sleepy, Earthly, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted, may get up, whereby to diſpleaſe the Lord? and cauſe him to with-draw his ſweet and preſerving preſence from any that know him: But let all keep the King of Righteouſneſs his Peace, and walk in the ſteps of the Flocks of the Companions: For withering and deſtruction ſhall come upon all ſuch as deſert the Camp of the Lord, or with their murmuring Spirit, diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et the Heritage of God: For they are greater Enemies to <hi>Sion's</hi> glory, and <hi>Jeruſalem's</hi> Peace, than the open Armies of the <hi>Aliens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it is a VVarning to all, that make mention of the Name of the Lord in this Diſpenſation he hath brought us to. That they have a care how they let out their minds in any wiſe to pleaſe the luſts of the Eye, the luſts of the Fleſh, and the Pride of Life; which are not of the Father, but of this VVorld; leſt any be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted in a liberty, that maketh the Croſs of Jeſus of none effect; and the offence thereof to ceaſe: For ſuch will become as Salt that hath loſt its ſavor; and at laſt will be trod under the Feet of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60237:7"/>
God and Men. For the Lord will withdraw his daily preſence, and the Fountain will come to be ſealed up; and the Well of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation be ſtopped again.</p>
            <p>Therefore, as all would rejoyce in the joy of God's Salvation; let them wait for the ſaving Power, and dwell in it; that, knowing the Myſtery of the work of Regeneration, Chriſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in them the hope of their glory; they may be able in the motion of him, that hath begotten them through death to life, to go forth and declare the way of Life and Salvation.</p>
            <p>And all you, that are young Convinced of the Eternal Truth, come into it; and then you will feel the Vertue of it: And ſo, you will be Witneſſes; otherwiſe <hi>Vain Talkers, Wells without VVater, Clouds without Rain; for which ſtate is reſerved the Blackneſs of Darkneſs for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore gird up the loyns of your minds, and be ſober, and Tempt not God; but receive the Day of your Viſitation, and walk worthy of ſo great love, and delight to retain God in your Knowledge; and grieve not his holy Spirit, but joyn to it, and be led by it; that it may be an earneſt to you of an Eternal Inheritance.</p>
            <p>And take up your daily Croſs, and follow Chriſt; and not the Spirit of this World. He was meek, and lowly, he was humble and plain; he was few in Words, but mighty in Deeds: He loved not his Life unto death, even the reproachful death of the Croſs; but laid down his life, and became of no Reputation; and that for the Rebellious. <hi>O the height, and the depth, the length, and the breadth; yea, the unſearchableneſs of the love of God in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore, while it is to day, hearken to his Voice, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den not your Hearts; and make no bargains for your Self, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſult with Fleſh and Blood: But let the Lord be your Light, and your Salvation; let him be the ſtrength of your life, and the length of your Days. And this know aſſuredly, that none ever truſted to the Lord, and were confounded.</p>
            <p>Wherefore hold up your Teſtimony for God; as ye would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the Increaſings of his Life and love: And let your Light ſhine, and confeſs him before the whole World; ſmoother not his appearance, neither hide thy candle, God hath lighted in thee,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60237:7"/>
under a buſhel: For Chriſt walketh among his Candleſticks of pure and tryed Gold: Wherefore ſet thy light upon a Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick, and ſhew forth thy good Converſation in meekneſs and godly fear, that thou mayſt become a good Example; and others beholding thy good VVorks, may glorifie God. But for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious, the Fearful, and the Unbelieving, the Day haſtens upon ſuch, that the things, that belong to their Eternal Peace, ſhall be hid from their Eyes forever.</p>
            <p>And all you my dear Friends and Brethren, who are in Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for the Teſtimony of Jeſus, and a good Conſcience; look up to Jeſus, the Author and Finiſher of your Faith; who for the Joy, that was ſet before him, endured the Croſs, and deſpiſed the ſhame; and is ſate down at the Right Hand of the Father in the heavenly Place; into which, if you faint not, you ſhall all be received, after the Dayes of your Pilgrimage ſhall be at an End; with a <hi>VVell done, good and faithful Servant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though theſe afflictions ſeem not joyous, but grievous for the preſent; yet a far more exceeding weight of glory ſtands at the Door.</p>
            <p>VVherefore count it all Joy, you fall into theſe Tryals, and perſevere to the end; knowing that he that ſhall come, will come, and will not tarry, and that his Reward is with him. Remember the Martyrs of Jeſus; that loved not their lives to the death for his Names-ſake, that had called them. And Jeſus himſelf, that made a good Confeſſion before <hi>Pontius Pilate;</hi> who hath conſecrated through his Blood a new and living way for all, that come unto God by him, who is made a high Prieſt, higher than the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, one that can be touched and moved; and is daily touched and moved with our VVeakneſs and Infirmity; that through him we may be made ſtrong in the Lord, and more then Conquerors through him that hath loved us.</p>
            <p>VVherefore let it not ſeem, as if ſome ſtrange thing had happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to you, for all theſe things are for the Tryal of your Faith; which is more precious than the Gold that periſheth. 'Tis the old quarrel, Children of this World, againſt the Children of the Lord; thoſe that are born after the fleſh, warring againſt thoſe that are born after the Spirit: <hi>Cain</hi> againſt <hi>Abel,</hi> the Old World a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Noah, Sodomites</hi> againſt <hi>Lot, Hagar</hi> againſt <hi>Sarah, Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:60237:8"/>
againſt <hi>Iſaac, Eſau</hi> againſt <hi>Jacob, Egyptians</hi> againſt <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> the falſe Prophets againſt the true Prophets, as <hi>Iſaiah, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah, &amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> under the Profeſſion of the Letter of the Law againſt Chriſt, that came to fulfil the Law, and all his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual followers and Diſciples: And all the falſe Apoſtate Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans againſt the true and Spiritual Chriſtians, and Martyrs of Jeſus.</p>
            <p>So, your conflict is for the Spiritual Appearance of Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus againſt thoſe that profeſs him in words, but in Works and Converſations every day deny him; doing Deſpight to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of grace in themſelves, and thoſe that are led by it. But though <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> ſhall gather themſelves together to lay waſte the City of God; yet the Lord hath determined their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and he will bring it to paſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wherefore rejoyce, O thou little Hill of God, and clap thy Hands for Joy; for he that is faithful and true, Juſt and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and able to deliver thee, dwells in the midſt of thee: VVho will cauſe thee to grow and increaſe, till thou becomeſt a great Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; till thou becomeſt the praiſe of the whole Earth, and the whole Earth be filled with thy Glory,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to you all, who are the followers of the Lamb of God, who was dead, but is alive, and lives for evermore; who is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen in your Hearts, as a bright ſhining light, and is leading you out of the Nature and Spirit of this World, in the Path of Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. I have this to ſay by way of holy Encouragement un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you all; the Lord God eternal that was and is, and is to come, hath reſerved for you the glories of the laſt Dayes; and if ſo be, that the Followers and Martyrs of Jeſus in Ages paſt, when the Church was going into the Wilderneſs, &amp; his witneſſes into Sack-cloth, were notwithſtanding ſo Noble and Valiant for the Truth on Earth; that they loved not their lives unto the Death, and ſuffered joyfully the Spoiling of their Goods for the Teſtimony of Jeſus, how much more ought you all to be encouraged unto Faithfulneſs, who are come to the Reſurrection of the Day, which ſhall never more be eclipſed; in which the Bride-groom is come, to fetch you his Spouſe out of the WILDERNESS to give you Beauty for Aſhes, and the Garment of Praiſe for the <hi>SPIRIT</hi> of <hi>HEAVINESS</hi> who will cover you with his Spirit, and adorn you with his fine Linnen, the Righteouſneſs

of the Saints, lean upon his Breaſt for ever.
