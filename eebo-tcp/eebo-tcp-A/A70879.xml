            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

OBSERVATIONS
upon his Majesties late Answer to
the Declaration, or Remonstance of the Lords
and Commons of the 19. of May, 1642.</head>
            <div type="statement_and_commentary">
               <head>Pag. 1. Or of following the advise of our Councell of Scotland.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Ur case is not as Scotlands was in all points,
though in many it be very like, for our malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
party here is far greater and stronger, and
more inraged against us, by their owne great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and more animated by our weaknesse. Yet
we desire but the same satisfaction which Scotland had, without
so much reluctance given them by the King. For their <hi>Militia,</hi>
and all other subordinate power in that Kingdome, is setled in
such hands as are publikely confided in, and yet this is utterly
denyed us. And our holding <hi>Hull</hi> is not like their holding
<hi>Newcastle,</hi> yet their Honour is saved, whilst we are called unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raralel'd
Traitors, and they are restored to all demanded rights
and securances, whilst we are charged of unpardonable Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and satisfaction is not offered to us, but required from us,
in the most approbrious language that can be, yet still we will
not refuse the Councell of the Scots Lords, in yeelding to a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification,
nor depart from the example of them, in the manner
of securing the same.</p>

               <head>Pag. 2. That we should fancy and create dangers to Our Selfe.</head>
               <p>We have little cause to think that the same malignant party
which hath shed so much Protestant blood in Ireland, and about
the same time plotted a villanous massacre in Edenborough, hath
been supinely snorting in England all this Parliament, since
their vigilance is more concerned here, then in either of these
Kingdomes; and since they have advantages to doe mischifes
in England, far greater than in Scotland, and almost as great as
in Ireland, and for the Plots themselves, divers of them have
not been invisible, and yet if the King had not concealed, and
did not yet conceale, some passages (as being below him) they
had been more visible; but iealousie in such cases is not unpoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique,
and the lesse iealous the King is, the more we have cause
to be so: Ireland a few dayes before its ruine, had lesse ground
of feare then we have had; some of our Treasons here have not
been planted in Traines and Mines, so deep and dark, nor so
much resembled the Cockatrice eye, as that of Ireland, and if
the King be not privy to the Plots, yet as long as the Plotters
having aymes beyond him, plow with his heifer, and act by his
power, our condition is the more desperate and remedilesse, and
since the King cannot see into the breasts of those his followers,
whom we suspect, hee ought not so far to despise the publique
iealousies of whole Nations, or the distractions or insecurity of
such considerable multitudes as he doth; but the King appeales
to Gods all-searching eye, and we doe the same, imploring of
him to be the more vindicative in this case, the more destitute<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
we all are of any other recourse or redresse upon earth.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="statement_and_commentary">
               <head>Pag. 5. Wherein they usurp the word Parliament.</head>
               <p>The King frequently vowes to maintaine Parliaments in
their Priviledges, yet his Papers many wayes derogate from
them; For first if hee please to sever himselfe, those great
Councels are not to bee named Parliaments. Secondly, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65569:2"/>
name is due, the vertue of publique representation is
denyed them, they are not to bee lookt upon as the whole
Kingdome, and this is destructive to the essence of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Thirdly, if the concurrence of both Houses, <hi>Nullo
contradicente,</hi> be of some sanctity and authority, yet the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ior
part of both Houses is not so vigorous as the totall,
and here is another devise to frustrate all Parliaments.
Fourthly, if the maiority shall binde, and the mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
acquiesce therein, yet if it bee obiected that some
few factious spirits mislead and befoole the majority, all is
void, Parliaments thus are made ridiculous Assemblies, and
all Justice at the last resort is to be expected from the
Kings sole breast, or else no where; for if the King will
withdraw himselfe, all Courts as well as Parliaments are
thus defeated and disabled, and then if the King assumes
not sole power to himselfe, all Government is expired, and
no way is left for the Kingdome to preserve it selfe, and
what can be more unnaturall? In policy then, if wee are
growne weaty of Parliaments, and will dissolve them into
nothing, we ought to erect some other Court above them,
or in their stead, or else to resigne all into the Kings sole
boundlesse discretion, for any forme of Rule is better then
none at all; and before we demolish old structures, we ought
to be advised of the fashions of new.</p>

            <div type="statement_and_commentary">
               <head>Pag. 6. And whose advise we are resolved to follow.</head>
               <p>But what if the major and better part of the privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
concurre with the King, if Parliaments must down, that
Rule is better then Anarchy; But hitherto neither both
Houses, nor the Judges, nor the Lords of the Councell
have concurred, but if the concurrence of Parliaments be
not necessary, how can any other seeme but unnecessary,
and at meere discretion, hath not the King the same right
to shake off inferiour Councels, as that which is supreame,
or shall he have cause to confide in the knowledge of lesse

Honourable Courts, more then of that which is the quintes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of all his Subiects, which is indeed the very Throne
it selfe whereon he sits so sure, and whose consent and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
is that very Diadem which inriches his Temples, and
that Mace which armes his hands; who would have thought
in time of Parliament to have heard the name of Privy
Councellor cited to the lessening of Parliaments, yet here
nothing but the very name too is cited, nor no compsiance
promised but arbitrary; so many wayes are Parliaments
blowne away like bubbles, yet none is so much insisted on,
as that which seemes most incredible, that Master <hi>Pym,</hi> and
foure or five of his consorts should besot and stupifie two
or three hundred Gentlemen chosen out of the flow<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e of
the Kingdome, when as the King hath in Parliament some
spirits as Mercuriall, and heads as watchfull, and hearts as
resolute, without some extreamly violent Magicke, may
seeme incredible, nay, were it certaine that Master <hi>Pym</hi>
were the greatest Nigromancer living, and the deepest read
in black infernall arts, I should hardly trust the efficacy of
his spells in such expedients.</p>

               <p>That the Irish Rebels by their successe are now intentive
to roote out the English, is probable, but their first ayme
and cause of commotion might be some other more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular

               <head>Ibidem. As they have invaded that power of ours over the
Militia.</head>
               <p>The Question is not to be put indefinitely, whether or
no the King ought to order the <hi>Militia</hi> in times of no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
danger; our case is now upon supposition, if
the King in extraordinary danger will not yeeld to such a
Posture as the Kingdome thinkes most safe, whether the
Parliament may not order that Posture of themselves, so
the Parliament puts it. But the King puts it thus. If the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
invades his power over the <hi>Militia</hi> causelesly, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they may not as well seize any Subiects estates. That
question then which must decide all, is this, whether that
Posture which the Parliament chuses, or that of the Kings,
be most safe for the Kingdome at this time, and who shall
iudge thereof most properly. Till now that the ancient
Pillars of Law, and Policy were taken away, and the State
set upon a new basis, no evill was to be presumed of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative
body of the Kingdome, nor no Justice expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
from a King deserting his grand Councell, but now
every man may arraign Parliaments, &amp; they which under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
no reason, must have reason, not authority to rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
no King was ever yet so just but that Parliaments have
in some things reduced them from error, nor no Kings so
unjust that Parliaments did seduce into errour, yet Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are now charged of being enemies to Religion, laws,
liberties. And the King to preserve these, absents himselfe
from Parliaments, but since we must dispute for Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
first we say they must in probabilitie be more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then any other privadoes; Secondly, in regard of their
publike interest, they are more responsible then any other,
and lesse to be complayned of in case of errour. Thirdly,
they have no private interest to deprave them, nothing can
square with the Common Councell but the common good,
and if 500. of the Nobilitie and Gentrey should ayme at
an Aristocraticall usurpation, or any other power of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
they could never compasse their ends, it were folly
in them. Some such objections have beene made against


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65569:4"/>
this Parliament, but finding little credit, at last some few of
the Parliament are pitcht upon, as if it were credible that all
the kingdome in whose hands all reall naturall power con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
would inslave themselves to 500. or those 500. volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily
become slaves to five men. (good God) the King is
presum'd to have the hearts of the majority, and to bee
trampled upon by some few, and yet the magicall incanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is so strong, that neither the Kings Authoritie, nor the
justice of his cause, nor the oppressed Commonaltie can
prevaile against the Parliament, or the Parliament it selfe,
against such an inconsiderable number in Parliament. O
that some Mercury would reconcile my understanding in
this Court Logick, or give me some clew of thread to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingage
me out of this blind Labarinth; but to come more
particularly to the <hi>Militia</hi> it selfe, now setled by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the King excepts against the Parliaments ordinance,
for two reasons, first because it excludes him for the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of it, and secondly from determining it at his pleasure,
but we must know that the Kingdome trusts the King with
Armes as it doth with the Lawes, and no otherwise, and
since the King in Person is not most fit alwayes, nor can in
all places be present, to execute either military or judiciall
offices, therefore the maine execution in both is intrusted
to substitutes; the end of all Authority in substitutes is, that
the kingdom may be duely and safely served, not that the
Kings meere fancy may be satisfied, and that end is more
likely to be accomplished where the Kingdome, then where
the King chuses, but whosoever chuses the substitutes, the
King is not excluded thereby, for the King hath more cause
to confide in men recommended by his highest Court, then
the people have in men preferred meerely by the King,
against the consent of his highest Court; and if it were not
so, vet the confidence and assurance of the people, in times
of distractions, is more requisite then the Kings, but in this
new <hi>Militia,</hi> the King is not so much excluded from his
generall superintendance, and supreame influence, as he is
in subordinate Courts of Justice, and yet even in the Kings
Bench, where the King in Pleas of the Crowne may not sit


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65569:4"/>
as Judge, he may not bee said to be excluded, neither is it
any prejudice to the King in the second place, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
determine these new Commissions at his pleasure with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
publik consent, except upon misdemeanour, for though
all men naturally desire absolute command, and to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controleable
in things that are bad as well as things that
are good, yet this is but the exorbitant desire of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
nature, and wise men doe not seeke alwayes to
satisfie it, but rather to suppresse it. In case of misdemeanor
no mans commission shall justifie him agains the King, and
where no misdemeanour is, what would the meere power of
determining the commission availe the King. For wee see
in divers Monarchies and free States, some Princes which
are limited from evill are not the more disabled from good,
and if they be sometimes, that nation is perhaps happier,
which intrusts Princes too little, then that which intrusts
them two farre, and yet neverthelesse I desire to see no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation
in our English Monarchy, neither if this King
shall upon this or that emergent occasion yeeld to some
temporall restraint, would I wish to see it perpetuall, except
in things onely tending to evill, for example, the King had
a Prerogative to discontinue and dissolve Parliaments at
pleasure, and the abuse of this Prerogative was the cause of
all our late sufferings, but this Prerogative being restrayned,
what injury is likely to follow eyther to the King or State,
for in such restrictions, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> are from greater evills, but from
lesse good, the King ought not to be difficult, and in such
restrictions which may disable from good, as well as evill,
the people ought not to be importunate; but it is further ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected
that by the same power Parliaments may disseise
both the King and Subiects from their estates, as they make
ordinances for the <hi>Militia,</hi> but in truth is not this a strange
result, the Parliament have power to doe good offices by
the consent of the people, &amp; therefore they may have power
to doe ill offices against the consent both of King and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
it is of dangerous consequence to suppose that Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aments
will do any iniustice, it looseth one of the firmest

and People, from whom all their power is derived, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall:
and whereas the King claymes an interest
in the <hi>Militia</hi> as legall and proper as ours are, in our
Lands or Tenements, we must avoyd mistakes herein; for
in our goods and inheritances we have not so pure and
unconditionall a right, but that it is inconsistant with
the common right also, and in this respect the Kings posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
are not priviledged more then a subiect, for the
States proprietie cannot bee excluded out of eyther,
the same man also may have severall proprieties in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
things, for that propriety which the King hath in a
Subiect, is not the same, nor so intire as that which he hath
in his horse, for that right which he hath as a Prince, is by
way of trust, and all trust is commonly limited more for
the use of the party trusting, then the partie trusted; in some
cases also there are mutuall proprieties, and so the King
ownes us as his Subiects, and wee owne him as our King,
but that ownership which we have in him as our King, is of
a farre more excellent and high nature then that ownership
which the King hath in us as his Subiects; that occasionall
interest which the Scots had in <hi>Newcastle,</hi> or the Parliament
in <hi>Hull,</hi> did not wholly drowne the Kings interest, nor the
Particular owners, such temporary possessions may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
happen without the utter disseisin or dissinherison of
each other, and we see in a breach of peace, the Constable by
force takes my sword from me, and in such manner as hee
may not take my cloake, although my interest in my Sword
is as good as in my cloake, and yet my property in my
Sword is not altered by that propertie which the officer sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
to himselfe; and doubtlesse had the same arguments
beene pressed against disseisin of <hi>Lesley,</hi> as have beene
since against Sir <hi>Iohn Hotham,</hi> they would have beene

                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:65569:5"/>
taken by Sir <hi>John Hotham,</hi> upon an extraordinary necessity of
State so declared by the Judgement of Parliament, for the
preventing of civill Warre; and consequently for the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of great dis-service, both to King and State; the same
thing, as the violent intrusion of a private dis-seizor upon the
just inheritance of his Neighbour: he which confesses, That the
King hath a true and perfect interest in the Kingdom, doth not
deny, That the Kingdom hath a more worthy and transcendent
interest in it self, and in the King too: This is so far from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction,
that he is farre from reason, that so conceives it.
And he which doth not conceive that that which is the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the major part in Parliament, is the sence of the whole
Parliament; and that which is the sence of the whole Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is the judgement of the whole Kingdom; and that
which is the judgement of the whole Kingdom, is more vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
and sacred, and unquestionable, and further beyond all
appeal, then that which is the judgement of the King alone,
without all Councell, or of the King, with any other inferiour
Clandestine Councell, most raze those rocky Foundations,
upon which, this State hath been so happily settled, for so many

pleads retractation &amp; satisfaction, his
retractation is an acknowledgement,
that it was a casuall single mistake;
yet in forme only; for the grounds of
his charge when they shall be publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
he assures us, will satisfie the
world; But in the mean time, these
grounds are kept unpublished, contrary to the desire of the
Parliament, and the whole Kingdom, and till that publication
the world remains unsatisfied, nay it is most wonderfull, that
so desperate and horrid a plot, as that yet seems to be, should
be so long neglected, to the Kings vast dis-advantage, and the
peoples miserable disquiet, if cleer satisfaction could be so
easily given, every man sees, that the charge, if it had not good


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65569:6"/>
grounds did stab furiously at the heart of all Parliaments, and
at all Liberties in Parliament, but till publication of these
grounds be, no man will presume to judge; yet it is of great
concernment to His Majesties honour, and the Kingdoms
peace, that it be not too long delayed. But in the next place,
the King conceives, That the Parliament hath been injurious
to him in Vindication of Parliament priviledges, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ought to be satisfied; the Parliament still begs for that
publication, for nothing else can make them appear to have
been injurious; and till they appear to have been injurious;
they ought not to be condemned as injurious, for <hi>de non entibus
&amp; de non apparentibus eadem est ratio;</hi> As for the Kings coming
into the House of Commons so armed, till publication of the
cause of that coming, the circumstances cannot be duely

               <p>By this Law the Subjects of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>

Law, I think every man sees that the English mans liberty, and
share in the grand Charter, is a thing easily deseasable, for it is
as likely, That the King may justifie and protect His Ministers,

Nay, though he disavow the sheltring of ill Ministers, yet he

it is the same thing to conceal, as to shelter a Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent;

yet may truly say, there is not
the same zeal exprest, as was against
the Scots, though the case be farre
different, for the Scots were Protestants, and had been greatly
agrieved, and were not imbrued willingly in bloud, and yet
the English Nation against their wills, were most rigorously
hastned, and inforced to Arm against them; but now, when
the English Nation and Scots too, were moved to indignation,
and horrour, against the most bloudy perfidious ingratefull
villaines in the world; their proffered supplyes are retarded,
and opportunities are neglected, and nice exceptions framed,
and the cursed reproaches of the Rebels themselves, calling
the Parliament disloyall and Traytors, are countenanced and
seconded.</p>
               <p>The depositions taken concerning

evince beyond all doubt, that any
such agitation was with the Kings
privity; but according to humane judgement, which do not
alwayes proceed upon certain appearances of things. Some
such things were in agitation, and some presumption there is
of the Kings privity, and if in other cases such presumptions
as these do not alwayes passe, for good and strong proofs; yet
I in my experience, did never here before, that they were reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as light discourses, though the King now contemn them so;
Neither is the meer miscarriage of the plot without the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
of the Parliament, any good argument that no such

which they failed to surprise, for treason were no treason, if it
were not more obscure and hard to be discovered, and that as

and how farre theeves, and boutifures intermingled themselves

Parliament is as desirous to have justice seasonably done there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
as the King; But sure, the English Nation, nor the City,
nor the Parliament, cannot be suspected of having any intent
to raise Arms against the Kings Person, or His Children: this
were a great scandall and unmerited, and if the Kings flight
was for fear of any cursed Assassinates; for which the English
have not been infamous, His ordinary Guard had been as safe

and Arbitrary subjection; this sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
is inconsistent with one of
the most sacred and venerable pillars
of all Law and policy; and yet here
it is insisted upon, Let all Chronicles be searched, and let one
Story be cited of any Parliament, which did tyrannize over
King and Subiect, or ordain any thing to the mischief of both;
yet Kings I think will not make the same challenge, the best of
them have done Acts of oppression, and the Reasons are appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
for it; but no Reasons can be given why Parliaments
should usurpe, or how they can usurpe; yet the Kings inference


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65569:7"/>
runs against all Parliaments: He doth not say this Parliament
tyrannizeth, and therefore he resides from them, and pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
their Votes invalid, but because Parliaments may tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize;
therefore they have no power in their Votes at all, at any
time whatsoever, further then the King ratifies them. The
Parliament sayes not so much; they say he is now seduced by
wicked Councell, and therefore rejects their requests, to the
danger of the State: In such cases they conceive there is a
power in them to secure the State without his concurrence:
At other times, when the Kings are not seduced, they ought
to do nothing without their consent; for <hi>non recurrendum est

Councellors which suggest advice to him, as his late papers
carry in them, they are the malignant party; and their study
is, That some way may be found out, so to master and quell
this Parliament, as that is may president future times to do the
same. Nothing is more visible, then that Parliaments are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
to Court parasites; and the same disposition which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continued
them so long, and dismissed them so often, still la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours

Traytors: for seeking their own defence, for enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
any jealousies, or for mentioning any plots: what
late change there is in the King, or alienation from the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors

they do truely represent him and his Councellors to us, we
may doubt that Parliaments are not gotten into better grace
at Court, then they were in my Lord of <hi>Straffords</hi> time; and
yet it is undoubted, That if we suffer in the Rights of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
no other rights can be done us: And as we were better

such who are more to be trusted, then our selves, few Cases are

               <p>How the King is to given an account

and that publike consent of such, and such Nations, as to such

by common consent, can neither set limits, or judge of limits set
