            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Why / his meaning in writing vnto you / was not that you should take the paines to seeke for him. Did you thinke that he did not know where he was himselfe? Or did you thinke him to haue bene cleane lost / that you sought so dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently for him? I thanke you brethren / I can be well though you do not send to knowe how I do. My mind towards you / you shal from time to time vnderstand by my pistles.

I may do it / for you haue broken the conditions of peace betweene vs. I can do it / for you see how I am fauored of all estates (the puritans onely excepted.) I haue bene entertayned at the Court: Euerye man talkes of my worship. Manye would gladly receiue my bookes / if they coulde tell where to finde them. I hope these Courtier<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> will one day see the cause tryed betweene mee and you. I haue manie sonnes abroad / that will sollicit my suite. My desire is / to haue the matter tryed / whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your places ought to be tollerated in any Christian commonwealth. I saye they ought not: And I say / Iohn Canterburie and all / ought to be out of his place. Euery Archbishop is a petty Pope / so is euery Lord bishop. You are all the pack of you / eyther hirelings or wolues. If you dare aunswere my reasons / let me see it done. Otherwise / I trow / my friends and sonnes will see you one day deposed.</p>
            <p>The Puritans are angrie with me / I meane the puritane preachers. And why? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I am to open. Because I iest / I iested / because I delt against a worshipful iester. D. Bridges / whose writings and sermons tend to no other ende / then to make men laugh. I did thinke that Martin shoulde not haue beene blamed of the puritans / for telling the trueth openly. For may I not say / that Iohn of Canterbury is a pettie pope / seing he is so? You must then beare with my ingramnesse. I am plaine / I must neede call a Spade a Spade / a Pope a Pope. I speake not against him / as he is a Councellor / but as he is an Archbishop / and so Pope of Lambeth. What will the Puritane seeke to keepe out the Pope of Rome / and maintaine the Pope at Lambeth? Because you will do this / I will tell the Bishope how they shall deale with you. Let them say that the hottest of you / hath made Martin / and that the rest of you were consenting there vnto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

By this meanes M. Wiggington / or such as will refuse to take an othe against the lawe of the land / will presently be founde to haue made Martin by the bishops / because he cannot be gotten to sweare that he made him not: And here is a deuice to fynde a hole in the coat of some of you puritanes. In life sort / to fynde the Printer / put euery man to his othe / and fynd meanes that Schilders of Middleborough

            <p>For the rest that will needs haue my bookes / and cannot keepe them close: I care not how the bishops deale with such open fellowes. And bishops / I woulde I could make this year 1388. to be the woonderful year / by remoouing you all out of England. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin hath tolde the trueth / you cannot denie it / that some of you do iniuriously detayne true mens goods / as Iohn of London: And some haue accounted the preaching of the word to be heresie / as Iohn of Canterburie / &amp;c. All of you are in an vnlawfull callng / &amp; no better then a broode of pettie Popes. It will be but Follie for you to persecute the Courtier Martin / vntill you haue cleared your selues (which you can neuer do) of the crimes he hath layd to your charge.

               </gap>ooke he hath now performed: wherein he hath behaued himselfe verye scholerlike. His stile is as smooth as a crabtree cudgell. The lieader cannot chuse but haue as great delight therein / as a Iacke an Apes hath in a whip: he hath so thumped the cause with crosse blowes / that the puritans are like to haue a good and a sound cause of it as long as they liue. In this one thing I dare preferre him before any that euer wrote: to wit / that there be not 3. whole periods for euery page in the book / that is not graced with a verie faire and visible solacism. O most excellent and surpassing eloquence. He speaketh euery thing so fitly to the purpose / that he neuer toucheth the matter in question. A rare gift in a learned writer. He hath vsed such varietie of lerning / that very often he hath translated out of one mans writing / 6. or 7. pages toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther / note here a newe founde manner of bookemaking. And which is more strange / he bringeth those testimonies for his purpose / whose very words translated &amp; set down by him / are as flat against the purpose whereto he bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them / as fire in quallity is contrary to water. Had not he a right vse of his wits think you / while they were thus bestowed? Not to stand long in this place of those qualli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in him / whereof before I haue made some mention to his praise in the former Epistle. Whatsoeuer might be for
<pb facs="tcp:12604:4"/>
the ornament and furthering of an honest cause / he hath in this booke so defied them all / that elsewhere you are to seeke for them / for here they are not to be found. Wherin he hath very wisely and prudeutly obserued the <hi>decorum</hi> of the cause in hand. Like lips like Lettice / as it is in the prouerbe. The goodnes &amp; honestie of the matter he hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led / required such good &amp; honest proffs as he brought. Let those that handle honest and godly causes / labor to bring good prooffs and a cleare stile. Presbyter Iohn defended our Church gouernement which is full of corruptions / &amp; therefore the stile and the prooffs must be of the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that the cause is. The priest leaues not so much as the title of the Discourse vnexamined. The title forsooth is <hi>A learned discourse, &amp;c.</hi> A sawcie title / but what sayth the lerned Bridges vnto it. O you know he is good at a stale iest / euer since he plaide my Lord of Winchesters foole in his sermon at Sir Maries Church in Cambridg / &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he iesteth at the title. I vs / the puritans haue nothing to doe with that sermon: why should they hit their bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the teeth therewith? he hath made their betters to laugh at him for his Sermon since that time. And whye should he not? for his grace will allow him / because he is content that bishops should be Lords: he hath subscribed / weareth a corner cap and a tippet / &amp; woulde gladly come to the honor / to weare that which might make him a lord spirituall / and if it were a shauen crowne / or a coxcombe / which his grace his articles would enioyn him to weare / what hurt could that do vnto him?</p>
            <p>Now I wonder what our brethren will say to this / that their booke is scoffed at / at the first dashe. I am sure their noses can abide no iest. What say they man / do you make anye question of that? I warraunt you they will affirme that the author of the Learned Discourse / and 500. green heads more that are on their side / within 2.

            </p>
            <p>It is a hard matter I tell you / to conceiue all the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domnes of this syllogisme. For if you marke the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition very well / you shall therein finde the errors (as M. doctor accounteth them) of Peter and Paule / verye notablie ouerthrown. The one of them calleth <note place="margin">1. Peter 2.13.</note> the ciuill gouernement / an humane ordinaunce: the other <note place="margin">Ephes. 4.12. rom 12.8. 1. cor. 12.28.</note> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth our sauiour Christe to haue ordayned euery mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster and Church officer / that were at anye time to be in the Church / and to haue tyed the ministerye vnto two ordinarie functions / of pastors and doctors. But his worship lighting vpon william Woodcockes diuinitie / putteth in the propositions / both / that the Church go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment is an ordinance of man / inuented and orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by man / and also that there may be as many sortes of ministers in the Church (if the magistrate will haue it so) as there be degrees of ciuill officers in a common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. For the Church gouernement is no more prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in the word (sayth the deane) then the ciuill gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is.</p>
            <p>You may see then / how headie and peruerse these our brethren are / that had rather sticke vnto a poore fisher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and Tentmaker / Peter and Paule / in a matter of trueth / then imbrace the manifest falsehood of so plaine an vntrueth / with a fat deane / and all the braue spiritual Lordes in the lande. Well fare our cleargie men yet / (who being like the priest whereof Iohn of London ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth mention of / in his foresaid booke / page 32. line 3.<note place="margin">Another course at you brother London.</note> that sware by his priesthood / that if the Trinitie were not in his portesse / he would not beleeue it) will allow of nothing / but that which is in the B. of Canterburies Articles / be it neuer so often read in Paules writings.</p>
            <p>And I trow M. doctors reasons following / wil make

And his grace admonisheth the puritan preachers often inough / that howsoeuer they haue trueth of their side: yet they must not runne beyond a law / and without law: if they doe / though they haue Peter and Paule to speake for them / yet by your leaue / hee hath in his hande that whiche will tame them and all their fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It suffizeth that suche orders as are not prescribed in the word / as things necessarie to saluation / be they ciuill or ecclesiasticall / bee onely foulded vp within those that are prescribed / and to make them as things expedient to edification / order and comelines / for obedience sake / al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be none of those things that appertaine to any necessity of our saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / or to any absolute necessity of our obedience. But such is the Church gouernement as it is not prescribed in the word / as necessarie to salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion / or of any absolute necessity of our obedience. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is sufficient that the Church gouernment be one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foulded vp within the things prescribed in the worde / and be of the nature of the thinges that onely belong to edification / order and comlines.</p>
            <p>I was neuer so affraid in my life that I shoulde not

come to an end / till I had bene windlesse. Do you not see how I pant? Our brethren now are to come to their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere / Concerning necessarie to saluation / then say they / we woulde knowe brother Bridges / &amp; thrise learned bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bridges / we woulde know what you meane: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther such a necessitie / as without which / men cannot bee saued. I meane euen the same (sayth M. deane) as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth page 60. line 21.22. of my booke: then we replie that nothing is of this necessity / but only iustifieng faith / and we denie the sacraments to be of this necessitie. For the theefe on the gallowes <note place="margin">Luke 23.43.</note> was saued without them. And we thinke moreouer / that your impietie and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance (M. deane) to be outragious / and intollerable (say they) in that you go about to teach the holy Ghost what he shall prescribe in the word: because by this proposition of yours / nothing should be prescribed therein? concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the sacraments: for they are not there prescribed / as things necessarie to saluation / in such sort as men cannot be saued without them.</p>
            <p>But if you ment not this necessitie / then wee woulde knowe / if you can tell your selfe what you woulde haue / (forsooth brethren / a bishoppricke he would haue / and all such troublesome fellowes as you are / bannished y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> land) Hoe yon meane such a necessitie / as euerie Church is not bounde to obserue the same order vpon their obedience.

That euery Church is not bounde to haue a pulpit 4. foot high / for they may without sin haue one lower or higher / if expediencie &amp; edification require

the same. That is euen my moaning in deede / and so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> would / page 59. (saith M. dean:) <hi>That these things should be vrged no otherwise, then Paule doth vrge them: that is, not placing the perfection of religion in them, or making them orders necessarie for the building, but rather for the ornaments of the building, and so squaring them all accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto the rule: Let all be done honestly, and by good order.</hi> Is this your meaning (M. doctor) you haue spun a fayre thred. Can you tell your brother Marprelat with all your learning / howe to decline what is Latine for a goose. Why this euery one of your brethren his selfe wil graunt to be true / and they neuer denied it at any time. But this is not the question. For it is neither concerning Churche officer / office / or anye part of Church gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment / whereof the question is instituted: but it is concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning matter of circumstance. Yet (brother Iohn) what do you meane by these contrarieties in this point. For you haue heard / page 59 / you meane by things necessary to saluation / matters of indifferencie: and page 60. line 21 / 22. you meane an absolute necessitie / without which / men cannot be saued. Do you think that you can answer men / by saying that you in deed wrote / page 79. But D. Perne wrote page 60. the which you had no leysure to ouersee.

And warned M. doctor / saye the puritanes / we will giue you leaue to take eyther of these 2. necessities to be your meaning. If you meane / as page 59. be necessarie to saluation / then they denie the assumption. And yet they will haue one course more at the proposition before they goe / because it came from home: and will bring foorth a Iesuit / vnlesse betimes it be had to the house of correction. They say the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that you still ioyne with Bellarmine. For in the state of
<pb facs="tcp:12604:11"/>
the question / concerning tradition: He hath the same ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill / cap. 3. lib. 2. against Caluin / Luther and Kemnitius / which you haue concerning comdines / and order in this place / against your brethren. What a sawcie fellow was that Bellarmine / that must needes publish his worke for the Pope / one iust yeare before you published yours for the Archbishop? Could he not keep it in / vntill both your books might be published together. For now these puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans do shake you very shrewdly / for borrowing popishe stuffe from Bellarmine / &amp; ouerthrowing her Maiesties supremacie: whereas I am perswaded / that although Bellarmin had neuer written / yet the master that taught him / would in time haue fully instructed you / in all these points that are forged vpon his Anvil. And although (as I thinke) he saued you a great deale of studie / yet I pray you let D. Perne write vnto him / that he may know his fault / and you be certified when hee writeth againe / that both your bookes may come forth together.</p>
            <p>Nowe if in your assumption (saye our brethren) if you meane by necessitie to saluation / that without which men cannot be saued as before: it is true / that the Church go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment is not of this necessitie / for in that sence as was sayd / the sacraments are not necessarie to saluation / or of a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Your mastership 3. maner of wayes shew the place they alleage / to make nothing for their purpose. First say you / Paule speaketh of diuers functions / there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nothing of Ecclesiasticall gouernment. This reason brethren is a very sound one / if you should denie it / then in deede / I must thinke you not to be altogether so lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denheaded as your brother Bridges. For do you thinke that a man entreating of the Maior of London / the two Shiriffs and their offices / speaketh by &amp; by of some part of the order &amp; gouerment of the citie of London? or of som of the gouernours of the citie. As though my L. Maior &amp; the two Shiriffes were now become to be any of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours of the citie of London / or their offices any part of that gouernment. Who seeth not by this example / the folly of our precise brethrens reason euidently declared. The Apostle (say they) speketh of Apostles / prophets / E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelists / pastors / doctors / and their functions (for this M.D. confesseth) therfore he speaketh of some ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call gouernours / and of some part of ecclesiasticall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement.
<pb facs="tcp:12604:18"/>
Apostles / prophets / pastors and doctors / are church gouernours with them / and their office a part of ecclesiasticall gouerment. Let them learne / let them learn simple siginnes as they are / that the Apostle speaketh in this place / of ecclesiasticall functions / and not of any part of ecclesiasticall gouerment. For so M.D. in this 61. pag compare line 17. with line 22. teacheth vs to speake Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish: making an ecclesiasticall function / to be a thing alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether differing in nature / from euery part of ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call gouernment.

of the persons Lord. You saye he doth not. No doth not? Then out of your owne grant he speaketh nothing of ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall gouernment and gouernors. Because euerie ecclesiasticall gouernour must needs be a Lord / and so ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall gouernment / a lordly gouernement. If this be not true / aske my brother Bridges. For should God ordaine great men / and great Lords to be rulers in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealths / ouer whome hee hath not so great care as he hath for his Church / and ordayne none but beggerly fellowes (not able to spend 200. markes by the yeare / nay nor 20. neither) to beare rule in his Church?</p>
            <p>I grant in deed / that you brethren puritans / saye the trueth as it ought to be / that bishops or ministers ought not to be Lords in any wise / eyther as ministers / or as ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill magistrates. Thus in deed it ought to be / I and my brethren the Bb. do grant vnto you. And you knowe we would it were so. But you know also that our laws will haue Church gouernours to be Lords / and what? should our Bishops (good noble men) refuse that which the law would haue them to take? Get you the law to be against their lordly callings / and see whether they will not giue ouer their Lord bishopdomes / whensoeuer lawe compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them. And whensoeuer they giue ouer / they shall haue no cause to thanke suche enuious brethren as you are. Howsoeuer it be / you see the Apostle / speaking of all sorts of ministers / by your owne confession: speaketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of any Lord / or Lordly gouerment among them all / and therefore speaketh nothing of Church gouernment. Againe / all those functions whereof the Apostle maketh any mention / (as my brother Bridges hath well noted) are ordayned to the buylding of the bodie of Christe / in the vnitie of fayth and knowledge. Nowe I would anye puritan of you all / durst say that our Church gouernors: that is / our venerable and worshipfull Lord bishops / are ordained of God / for the building of his bodie / which I

I know you will not. And what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is it then / that you should require Bb. to be ordinary preachers / seeing euery bishop is a ciuil gouernour. I tel you true / I am so far from thinking / that bishops ought to be ordinarie preachers / seeing they are ciuill gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours / that I hold it a sin for them to preache ordinarily. And brethren / you doe not well therefore / in vrging ciuil gouernours to preach / especially seing you your selues / in your platformes / are against this point. And because it shall be seene that I deale vprightly betweene you and the P.P. prelates.

I hope by this time you see it

plaine that Bishops sinne / both because they are ciuill gouernours / and being ciuill gouernours / because they are bishops.</p>
            <p>Your 2. reason is / page .61. line <hi>39. Paule speaketh of these gifts and of this building, and of the orders and ends thereof: therefore he speaketh nothing of ecclesiasticall gouernment.</hi> This is put home I trow / and ouerthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the puritans out of all cesse.

M.D. 2. reason to shew that the place of Paul maketh nothing for ecclesiastical gouernment / is after this sort. <hi>Paul in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning vp these gifts, referreth all to the vnitie in doctrine of fayth, and to the holy conuersation of life. Ergo he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth no mention of Ecclesiasticall order of gouernment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That were a pitifull hearing in deed sir / that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle should speake of ecclesiastical gouernment / and speak not a word of any lordlike gouernment: that the Apostle should make any mention of ecclesiasticall gouernours / &amp; not name a Lord among them all.

            <p>But in good sadnes (saith the puritans) presbyter Iohn Bridges / will this place of Paule prooue no part of this gouernment which you oppugne? will it not prooue that God hath ordayned pastors / and doctors / to continue in his Church vnto the worlds end?

This I speake / to the ende you should not crie out (as some of you haue done) that our bishops haue no better warraunt for themselues then the pope hath / for their gouernement. I grant in deede / that if you should take M. deane at the worst / you might saye that he might herein / reason as well for the Masse / as he doth for the established gournement.

But he suffered it to continue a long time / &amp;c. Therefore he thought it not to be a false worship. I say you must not mistake M. doctor in this sort / but knowe that he delt after the manner of the schooles / wherein it is lawfull (as Thomas Cartwright who hath bene pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessour of diuinitie / both in Cambridge and in Gene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Parsou Bridges / page 68. saith / there are more giftes and callings then 4. pastors / doctors / elders and deacons remayning / because sayth he / page 69. <hi>the gifts of doing miracles, prophesie, the gifts of healing, diuers among the papists haue and do enioy, and especially, the gift of tongs, not attained vnto by studie, had diuers of them, as Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, &amp;c.</hi> Anthonie among the papistes / had the gifte of tongs without studie: Now what a goodyeare was that Anthonie?

            <p>As for the matter contayned in the 70.71.72. pages / M.

A Sermon vpon the 1. Cor. 12. printed by Robert Walde-graue: say our brethren / why there was neuer any sermon vpon that tert / printed by Robert Walde-graue. M. D. belike meaneth the sermon vpon Rom. 12. Tush brethren what should you tell vs of M.D. meaning / he meaneth the sermon vpon 1. Cor. 12. If you doe not beleeue me / looke the 255. page of his booke / and there you shall see the sermon vpon 1. Cor. 12. twise cited. M.D. if he were more beetleheaded then he is / could not possible misse so often in the naming of the sermon / vpon Rom. 12. which is so commonly knowen. It may be in deede / you neuer saw any sermon extant vpon that text: but I warraunt you Deane Iohn knoweth the way to Salisburie / so doe not many thousands of you puritans. Whye / you neuer sawe the Syriacke Testament translated by Iunius (for that which is abroade / was done by Tremelius alone) but M.D. hath quoted Iunius his Syriack Testament. Why then may he not aswell finde a sermon vpon 1. Cor 12. printed by Robert Walde-graue / as a Syriacke Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament of Iunius his trauslation? Now say the puritans what a notorious blocke is this deane / who inasmuch as he hath heard that M. Tremelius / and M.

But what then / should you therefore take him vp for it / as though he were the veriest asse in a countrie. Learned men may easily commit such ouersights / especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally quoting authors vpon other mens reportes / as M. D. hath done.
