            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>
               </hi> Need not tell you again what may be ſeen in my Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
to the Readers before my book of the ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
of the oath of the Kings Supremacy, how I
was induced to compoſe and publiſh it, conceiving it to
be a work of charity, to others, and a neceſſary duty
to my ſelf, as circumſtances then concurred. I have
found not a little fruit of my labor therein, by ſatisfying many that
I know, and more (as <hi>I</hi> am told) whom <hi>I</hi> know not, of the lawfulneſs
of taking ſuch oaths, as are therein aſſerted, and thereby preventing
the ruine of themſelves and families; though <hi>I</hi> find by the oppoſition
of ſome, that it hath proved an offence to others, inſomuch that <hi>I</hi> was
told, that <hi>I</hi> had thereby given occaſion of the alienation of many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds
from me, of whoſe peace and welfare <hi>I</hi> was, and ſtill am, very
tender. Beſides, what exceptions have been made in private confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
(which <hi>I</hi> have in ſuch conferences endeavoured to remove)
<hi>Richard Hubberthorn, Samuel Fiſher,</hi> and ſome others, have in
print oppoſed that writing. <hi>Richard Hubberthorn</hi> intitles his writing,
<hi>Antichriſtianiſm reproved,</hi> as if my book had contained <hi>Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianiſm:</hi>
which is a term that affrights many weak Chriſtians, and
is therefore by thoſe that craftily endeavour to uphold, and further
diviſions put upon thoſe actions, doctrines and writings, which they
would ſcare leſs diſcerning ſouls from, and ſo ſeparate them from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb facs="tcp:119289:3"/>
and faſten them to their party, though it be for the moſt part
but a frivolous imputation, and a groſs calumny. <hi>Antichriſtianiſm</hi>
according to the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> (who only of all the holy Writers, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
the term <hi>Antichriſt</hi>) being a greater matter then ſome er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
or evil in ſome points of practice, to wit, <hi>a denial of the father
and the ſon,</hi> 1 John 2. 22, 23. <hi>not confeſſing Jeſus Chriſt come in
the fleſh,</hi> 1 John 4. 3, 4. 2 John 7. of which ſort my defending the
lawfulneſs of ſome ſwearing is not. And to omit his nonſenſe, in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>the doctrine of Chriſt and his Apoſtles is juſtified againſt ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi>
meaning my doctrine of ſwearing, where he ſaith, that <hi>it is
there proved according to the Scriptures, that all my ſix Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for the lawfulneſs of ſwearing, are both againſt Chriſt and
his Apoſtles doctrine;</hi> It muſt needs be falſe, ſith he hath not
brought any Scriptures againſt the three laſt Propoſitions. As for
his Epiſtle to me, that which he inſinuates by his expoſtulations
with me, <hi>of dividing my ſelf from mine own people, of teaching
people to ſwear firſt one way, and then another; of my being long
a hiding my ſelf under ſo many falſe covers,</hi> is the foam and froth
of his railing ſpirit; of which he, and others of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> ſeem by
their frequent venting reproaches, unjuſt cenſurings and revilings, to
have gotten an habit, and are more like <hi>Antichriſtianiſm,</hi> then any of
my doctrines, who preach not up that which Chriſt and his Apoſtles
deny, but endeavour to clear their words from miſtake. Nor was
my writing indigested, <hi>as if God did not brook it,</hi> though <hi>I</hi> confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
in reſpect of the compoſure of it, there was want of ſuch accurate
digeſting, that is, framing in reſpect of words, method and matter, as
the thing required, by reaſon of my ſhortneſs of time, and yet there
was no cauſe for <hi>Samuel Fiſher</hi> to term it a <hi>toy,</hi> as he doth in the
margin of his Epiſtle to the Reader, before his impetuous, though
impotent book, intitled the <hi>Ruſticks alarm to the Rabbies,</hi> ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> Mr. <hi>Danſon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Richard Baxter,</hi> and my ſelf.
<hi>I</hi> confeſs <hi>I</hi> had an intention (and began to draw up a writing to that
purpoſe) to publiſh a fuller Treatiſe about ſwearing, having in Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chetical
Lectures, ſomewhat largely handled the general nature of an
Oath, the ſeveral forms and rites of ſwearing, the lawfulneſs of
ſwearing, the ſorts of Oaths, the rules, obligation, urging, diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Oaths: But my late continual moleſtations, impriſonment, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint
from my Miniſtery in the place where I was ſeated thirty years
before, and the uncertainty of my dwelling, have hindred me from
<pb facs="tcp:119289:3"/>
proſecuting thereof, and other works, which <hi>I</hi> hoped to accompliſh for
publique good: nor am <hi>I</hi> yet ſecured from the like moleſtation and
uncertainties, and therefore know not what <hi>I</hi> ſhall do, or reſolve to do
therein. Wherefore <hi>I</hi> have, being requested thereto, publiſhed this
little Supplement, whereby my aim is to benefit others, though <hi>I</hi> find
(as <hi>I</hi> have always done) the cleering of truth in this, to have occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
many hard cenſures of me, and much injury to me, which the
Lord forgive. Yet <hi>I</hi> hope <hi>I</hi> ſhall truly ſay with the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.
12. 15. And I will very gladly ſpend and be ſpent for you, though
the more I love you, the leſs I be loved.</hi> As for thoſe that find any
benefit by my labors in this matter, or any other, <hi>I</hi> requeſt them
that they would return thanks to God for it; and that all would
in their prayers to God for me, help me, who am</p>

<hi>Bellarmine</hi> would ſeem to impugn, ordained for
making a difference between the civilly obedient
Papiſts, and the perverſe diſciples of the Powder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaſon.

1615. by <hi>King James his ſpecial priviledge and command, p.</hi> 27. is
thus ſaid. The matter or main ſubject of this Oath, which is the
principal thing whereof I conceive you deſire to have a more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
and full underſtanding, may to this purpoſe be reſolved into
theſe enſuing aſſertions.</p>
            <p>1. Our Soveraign Lord King <hi>James,</hi> is the lawful King of this
Kingdom, and of all other his Majeſties Dominions and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>
            <p>2. The Pope neither by his own authority, nor by any other
authority of the Church, or of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor by any other
means, with any others help can depoſe his Majeſty.</p>
            <p>3. The Pope cannot diſpoſe of any of his Majeſties Kingdoms
and Dominions.</p>
            <p>4. The Pope cannot give authority to any forraign Prince to
invade his Dominions.</p>
            <p>5. The Pope cannot diſcharge his ſubjects of their allegiance
unto his majeſty.</p>
            <p>6. The Pope cannot give licence to one or more of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to bear arms againſt him.</p>
            <p>7. The Pope cannot give leave to any of his ſubjects to offer
violence unto his Royal perſon, or to his Government, or to any of
his Majeſties ſubjects.</p>
            <p>8. Although the Pope ſhall by ſentence excommunicate or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
his Majeſty, or abſolve his ſubjects from their obedience, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
they are to bear faith and true allegiance unto his
Majeſty.</p>
            <p>9. If the Pope ſhall by ſentence excommunicate or depoſe his
Majeſty; nevertheleſs his ſubjects are bound to defend his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and Crown againſt all attempts and conſpiracies whatſoever.</p>
            <p>10. If the Pope ſhall give out any ſentence of excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or deprivation againſt his Majeſty; notwithſtanding his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
are bound to reveal all conſpiracies and treaſons againſt his
Majeſty, which ſhall come to their hearing and knowledge.</p>
            <p>11. It is heretical and deteſtable to hold, That Princes being
excommunicate by the Pope, may be depoſed or murthered by their
ſubjects, or any other.</p>
            <p>12. The Pope hath not power to abſolve his Majeſties ſubjects
from their oath of allegiance, or any part thereof.</p>
            <p>When Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi> diſguiſed under the name of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaeus

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:119289:6"/>
               <hi>James</hi> his <hi>Apology for the Oath of Allegiance,</hi> and would have it
believed, that by that Oath was intended the denying the Popes
Eccleſiaſtical power, which he claims, and is with Papiſts an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of their Faith; <hi>Lancelot Andrews</hi> then Biſhop of <hi>Chichester,</hi>
after of <hi>Ely</hi> and <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> then very eminent for his learning
and repute at Court, anſwers him in his book intitled <hi>Tortura Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti,</hi>
in words in Latin, which I have Engliſhed thus.</p>
            <p>Art thou well in thy wits who babbleſt theſe things? That thou
an <hi>Italian,</hi> ignorant of our language, ſhouldſt underſtand the Oath,
that the Author who is skilled in the language, as being his own,
native, proper, ſhould not underſtand it? Whence art thou to us
a new interpreter of Laws? yea whence art thou an interpreter
of our Laws, which thou didſt not make? It belongs verily to them
to interpret to whom it belongs to make Laws; yet I ſay not
that only, but this alſo. Is there for this reaſon any mortal man
that underſtands the intention of the Law, and the Law-maker
himſelf, (for the ſame perſon was author of the Law and of the
book, nor waſt thou ignorant of this) the Law-maker (I ſay) him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
ſhould not underſtand his intention concerning his Law?
Thou wilt never bring it to paſs, that he ſhould be ignorant of that
which he himſelf would to himſelf, when he made the Law, when
he made the Oath. He is beſt privy to his own intention. But
his intention was that he might be ſecure of the fidelity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
of his own ſubjects, yea this was his only intention, no
other man knows this, (for the hearts of men he knows not) only
he who hath known the Law, knows what he requires in his
Law.</p>
            <p>King <hi>James</hi> in his <hi>Catalogue of</hi> Tortus <hi>lies,</hi> at the end of his
<hi>premonition to all Chriſtian Princes,</hi> ſaith, The Puritans do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
the Oath of Supremacy, but do daily take it, neither ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
it. And the ſame Supremacy is defended by <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf,
<hi>Inſtit. lib. 4. cap.</hi> 20.</p>
            <p>Biſhop <hi>Andrews</hi> in the book forenamed, <hi>p.</hi> 110. The Puritans
of their own accord take the Oath of Supremacy, and have often
profeſſed, and that in books publiſhed by themſelves, that this is
a meer calumny, that they abhor the Oath of Supremacy, neither
did they ever decline that Oath. But if there were at any time
any ſcraple in them, it was about the term, it was not about the
thing. The head of the Church ſith it is ſaid of Chriſt, ſeemed
to them a higher title, then that it might be given to any mortal
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:119289:7"/>
man: ſo for a while they ſtuck at the giving that title, now they
ſtick not: Concerning the thing it ſelf, concerning the Kingly au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
they have always fully profeſſed.</p>

lawfulneſs of ſome ſwearing, yet</hi> Samuel Fiſher <hi>in his book, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled</hi>
The Ruſticks alarm to the Rabbies, Exercit. 1. chap. 3. p. 48.
<hi>ſaith,</hi> I ſhould (God knows) pleaſe my ſelf much more to ſit down in
ſilence. p. 61. I affirm here before God and all men; <hi>and the humble
petition of ſome called</hi> Anabaptiſts, <hi>priſoners in</hi> Maidſtone, <hi>dated</hi>
January 25. <hi>ſaith thus; Yet</hi> (God is our witneſs, who is the ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
of all hearts) we deny not this Oath, becauſe we would not yield
due ſubjection and obedience unto thee and thy authority; for this we
ſay, in the preſence of him that ſhall judge the quick and the dead,
we do without any deceit, promiſe to live peaceably under thy Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and in caſe any thing ſhould be by thee commanded in ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
matters, wherein we cannot obey, we ſhall not then take up any
carnal or temporal weapon againſt thee or thy authority, but pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
ſuffer ſuch puniſhment as ſhall be inflicted on us for our conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
<hi>But the uſing of theſe ſpeeches</hi> [God knowes, <hi>I</hi> affirm before
God, God is our witneſs, this we ſay in the preſence of him that ſhall
judge the quick and dead] <hi>as an appeal to Gods conteſtation, is
plain ſwearing. So that while theſe men, and more of the ſame
mind do ſpeak againſt all ſwearing, they indeed practice ſome
ſwearing. And thoſe of</hi> Maidſtone, who offer an engagement ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
before ſome Juſtice of the Peace in a ſolemn manner, with calling
God to witneſs of the truth of <hi>what they ſay, do offer to ſwear or
take an oath. The lawfulneſs of which, and particularly the Oaths
of Supremacy and Allegiance, and my writing about the former, I
ſhall now endeavour to vindicate from the writings and ſayings
againſt them, which have occurred to me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Richard Hubberthorn</hi> having recited my firſt Argument for my
firſt Propoſition, thus, That is not wholly evil, about the uſe of
which ſome directions are given by God; but God giveth dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
about the uſe of ſwearing, <hi>Jer. 4. 2. Ergo:</hi> Anſwers, <hi>By the
ſame argument may it as well be proved, that the Chriſtians and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
in Christ may be circumciſed, offer incenſe, burnt offerings
and ſacrifices, becauſe for the uſe of it God gave ſome directions, and
therefore it is lawful. But as circumciſion, incenſe, burnt offerings
and ſacrifices of the law, is ended in Chriſt; ſo is the oath which was</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:119289:7"/>
               <hi>among the Jews, in him ended alſo to the believers, and by him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden:
for as it was ſaid in old time thou ſhalt ſwear, and ſhalt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
thy oath to the Lord; but Chriſt in the 5. of</hi> Mat. <hi>making men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Jews oath which God gave once direction for, yet ſaith,
Swear not at all. Here Chriſt puts an end, not only to frivolous &amp; vain
oaths, but to the true oaths, which the Jews was once commanded
of God to ſwear, for theſe oaths are they which Chriſts words hath
relation to, for he came to end the Jews worſhips and oaths, who is the
oath of God. Chriſt the truth and righteouſneſs of God ſaith, Swear
not at all, which ends the Jewes which was to ſwear in truth and
righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I reply, Had not <hi>Samuel Fiſher</hi> told me in the place
forementioned, that my book is anſwered by <hi>Richard Hubberthorn,</hi>
I ſhould not have thought it worth while to reply to it, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in it ſo much defect of ſenſe and reaſon, as makes it inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable:
But ſith he mentions my book, <hi>as ſcarce worth any further
anſwer then that of Hubberthorn,</hi> it ſeems he eſteems it of ſome
moment. And therefore I ſay, that 1. <hi>Richard Hubberthorn</hi> leaves
out of the proof of my minor [<hi>as in the third Commandment (which
is undoubtedly moral</hi>)] which words ſhew that I mean my <hi>major</hi>
propoſition of moral actions. 2. He ſuppoſeth that ſwearing allowed
by God in the Old Teſtament, which Chriſt corrects, was not
only frivolous and vain oaths, but the true oaths which the Jews
were commanded, and Chriſt was to end, who is Gods oath. But
he conſiders not that ſwearing was common to all Nations, as
<hi>Philiſtines, Gen.</hi> 21. 31. &amp; 26. 28. <hi>Syrians, Gen.</hi> 31. 53, &amp;c.
Nor is Chriſt any where termed in Scripture, <hi>Gods oath,</hi> nor an
oath made worſhip peculiar to the Jews; nor a ſhadow or cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
which might typifie Chriſt. Now my <hi>major</hi> propoſition
being (as the words ſhew I underſtood it) thus expreſſed, [That
action belonging to manners, common to all Nations, and not
proper to the Jews, about the uſe of which God giveth ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections,
is not wholly evil] is firm and unſhaken by the inſtances
of <hi>R. H.</hi> which are not of moral, but ceremonial Rites, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in Chriſt, but not ſo the moral commandment, of which ſort
ſwearing is, and ſo may be lawful.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>To my ſecond Argument, from</hi> Pſal. 63. 11. <hi>his anſwer is,</hi>
Only that David was in the old covenant of the law, but Chriſt in the
new Covenant bids; Swear not at all.</p>
            <p>Hereto I reply, This anſwer preſuppoſeth that an oath was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:119289:8"/>
to the Covenant of the law. But this is falſe, ſith it was,
in other Nations beſides Iſraelites, cuſtomary to ſwear even before
the law, as the inſtances in <hi>Geneſis</hi> and elſewhere ſhew. As for
his flings at <hi>hireling Prieſts and hypocrites,</hi> I let them paſs as being
only reviling, in general terms, in which is commonly guile &amp; ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
To the inſtances which I bring for the lawfulneſs of ſome
ſwearing, and urging to ſwear out of the Old Teſtament, he ſaith,
<hi>all theſe were under the firſt Covenant, and in that which Chriſt called
the old time,</hi> Mat. 5. <hi>and proves nothing that Chriſtians in the new
Covenant ſhould ſwear.</hi> To which I reply, 1. <hi>Abraham, Iſaac, Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,
Joſeph,</hi> were before the law, and they took oaths of Nations
which were not under the law. 2. In moral things the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
and examples of the old Teſtament, are rules to us ſtill,
<hi>Mat. 7. 12. Rom. 13. 8, 9. Epheſ. 6. 1, 2. James</hi> 2. 8, 10. 11.</p>
            <p>Nor doth he ſay any thing to the Angels ſwearing, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10. 6.
but this, <hi>that Chriſt ſaith, Swear not all,</hi> which doth not at all
avoid the objection, that the Angel knew Chriſts words do not
forbid all ſwearing, otherwiſe he would not have ſworn at all.</p>
            <p>But to the inſtances of <hi>Pauls</hi> adjuring and ſwearing, he writes
ſomewhat more. To the allegation of 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 27. where the
word ſignifies, I <hi>ſwear you by the Lord,</hi> he ſaith, 1. <hi>This is the long
and thick miſt of darkneſs, which hath been long kept over the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings
of people, that when the plain Scripture will not prove
their ends and intents, then they tell the people it is otherwiſe in the
Greek or Hebrew.</hi> I reply, 1. It is no darkning of peoples un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings
by latter tranſlations, to mend or to adde to former
tranſlations, ſith as in all other Writings and Arts, <hi>Dies diem
docet, One day teacheth another;</hi> latter Commentators and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters
without arrogancy, refine former. Nor doth this darken,
but inlighten mens underſtandings, nor give any occaſion to
doubt of the faithfulneſs of former Tranſlators, but only ſhews
the imperfection of their knowledge. Nor is there any juſt cauſe
why for this reaſon men ſhould waver in their faith, the main do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of faith and manners being by common conſent expreſſed
either in the ſame words, or words of the ſame meaning, and if
any ſhould deprave them, the variety of Copies and tranſlations
would remedy it.</p>
            <p>2. Saith <hi>Hubberthorn,</hi> Did <hi>not the Tranſlator of the Bible under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
Greek as well as</hi> John Tombes?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, and as <hi>John Tombes</hi> underſtood it, which he told
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:119289:8"/>
his Reader, that the Greek word was tranſlated, <hi>I charge you by
the Lord, or adjure</hi> you as it is in the margin.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Saith he,</hi> Or are we not to believe the Scripture, as it ſpoaks,
till again it be tranſlated by him?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes no doubt, and this place the rather, becauſe it is
tranſlated by him no otherwiſe then by the Tranſlators, only the
word [<hi>adjure</hi>] which is made an Engliſh word out of the Latin, is
explained, by, I ſwear you by the Lord, I urge, or put an oath on
you by the Lord, or as <hi>Samuel Fiſher</hi> ſaith, it ſignifies, I <hi>bind you
by oath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Saith he, <hi>It is I oblige or charge you in the preſence of God,</hi>
&amp;c. I reply, it is, I charge or oblige you by oath or ſwearing, not
only in the preſence of God, but alſo by the Lord.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Saith he,</hi> ſeeing <hi>John Tombes</hi> ſaith he ſwore them, he might
have declared in what manner they were ſworn, ſeeing Paul was at
Athens when he wrote to Theſſaloniea.</p>
            <p>I reply, He might underſtand how <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Athens</hi> could ſwear
them at <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> if he underſtood how <hi>Saul</hi> charged by oath,
or adjured, or bound by oath the people and <hi>Jonathan</hi> his ſon,
though abſent and ignorant, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 24, 28, 42.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>Saith he, John Tombes</hi> makes the like charge to be in 1 Tim.
6. 13. which according to the Greek he would make an oath; but it
is I injoin or command thee before God, not putting an oath on them,
or cauſing them to ſwear: And 2 Tim. 4. 1. not that he took him
ſworn, or put an oath on him, but did charge him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I reply, I ſaid not they were the ſame, but like charges, yet dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering,</hi>
1. <hi>In that the word</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>
               <hi>in the accuſative caſe, cannot be underſtood
any otherwiſe then thus [by the Lord] which is a form of ſwearing
more plain then that,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 1. <hi>though it be like it. But</hi> Samuel
Fiſher <hi>ſaith,</hi> nor doth <hi>John Tombes</hi> inſiſting on the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
1 Theſ. 5. 27. adde a jor to his proof; for howbeit it is ordinarily
us'd to ſignifie to adjure or bind one by oath, yet (being as ſome ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to confine, or (as ſome) of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a bound or limit) it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally
ſignifies to bind, limit, confine, oblige any way by word or
promiſe, as well as oath. And <hi>J. T.</hi> confeſsing Pauls charge in
that place, and 1 <hi>Tim. 6. 13. 2 Tim.</hi> 4. 1. to be alike, therein
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:119289:9"/>
confutes himſelf however. For the words <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
there uſed, are no more then to engage before ſome wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
(God or man) or ſolemnly to command or charge, and not to
ſwear one, and cannot be taken ſo ſtrictly as to adjure, though <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
may be taken in the moderate ſenſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> any way to oblige, as well as
in that rigid way of ſwearing.</p>
            <p>I reply, That the rule of expounding or interpreting words, is not
the derivation of the word, which often is very uncertain, but the
uſe (which is <hi>Vis &amp; norma loquendi, the force and rule of ſpeaking</hi>)
and there being no inſtance given by him of any place, where it is
uſed in any author of obliging, in his moderate ſenſe, without an
oath, and he confeſſing that, it is ordinarily uſed to ſignifie to
<hi>adjure</hi> or <hi>bind by oath,</hi> and it being I <hi>charge or adjure by the
Lord,</hi> it can be taken in no other ſence then ſwearing or binding
by oath; nor doth my alledging 1 <hi>Tim. 6. 13. 2 Tim.</hi> 4. 1. as
like charges, abate any whit the force of my proof, ſith I do not
call them the ſame, or the one as expreſs for charging by oath, as
the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In my fourth Argument I alledged,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 18, 23. <hi>and</hi> 11.
31. <hi>and</hi> 12. 19. 1 Cor. 15. 31. <hi>to prove the uſe of ſwearing by</hi>
Paul <hi>in Goſpel-times. To the firſt only</hi> Richard Hubberthorn
<hi>ſaith thus,</hi> Now thoſe that minds this Scripture, may ſee that <hi>Paul</hi>
doth only juſtifie Chriſts words in keeping to yea and nay, ſaying, that
with him it was not yea and nay, for ſaith he, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. but as God
is true, our word towards you was not yea and nay. <hi>And ver.</hi> 19. for
the ſon of God, Jeſus Christ, who was preached among you by us,
even by me and <hi>Silvanus,</hi> and <hi>Timotheus,</hi> was not yea and nay, for
all the promiſes of God in him are yea, and in him Amen. So that
this Scripture is ſo far from bringing people to oaths and ſwearing,
that he labours to bring them all to yea and nay in all things, and ſo
to Chriſt the ſubſtance, in whom all the promiſes of God are yea; ſo
that the Apoſtle might well uſe theſe words, that as God was true,
&amp;c. ſo alſo were they true to their yea and nay, the end of all
oaths.</p>
            <p>I reply. 1. <hi>Richard Hubberthorn</hi> in all this his pretended an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
doth not deny, the expreſſions 2 <hi>Cor. 1. 18. As God is true,
2 Cor. 1. 23. I call God for a record upon (or againſt) my ſoul,
2 Cor. 11. 31. The God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,
which is bleſſed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not, 2 Cor. 12. 19.
we ſpeak before God in Chriſt,</hi> to be forms of ſwearing. Surely the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:119289:9"/>
expreſſion, 2 <hi>Cor. 1. 23. I call God for record,</hi> is ſo plain an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing
to Gods teſtimony, which is the definition of an oath by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation
or conteſtation of God as true, and <hi>upon</hi> or <hi>againſt my
ſoul,</hi> by pawning or wiſhing a curſe to himſelf, if he ſpake not
true, and ſo appealing to God, not only as <hi>Toſtis</hi> or <hi>Witneſs,</hi> but
alſo as <hi>Vindex, the Avenger</hi> or <hi>Judge,</hi> if he ſpake not true, that I
find few or no expreſſions of ſwearing, more full then this, and
therefore do thence infer irrefragably, that <hi>Paul</hi> did ſwear, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently,
that he did not conceive Chriſt forbade all ſwearing,
and therefore it is but his conceit, that the preſcribing yea and
nay, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 37. was to put an end of all oaths. 2. Whereas
he ſaith, <hi>That this Scripture labours to bring them to yea and nay
in all things,</hi> and that <hi>Paul doth only juſtifie Chriſts words in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to yea and nay,</hi> it is ſo far from being true, that if the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of [<hi>yea and nay</hi>] were meant of uſing thoſe words without
ſwearing, as <hi>R. H.</hi> doth vainly imagin, the Apoſtle would be ſo
far from <hi>bringing them to yea and nay in all things, and juſtifying
Chriſts words in keeping to yea and nay,</hi> that he ſhould indeed do
the contrary, foraſmuch as he ſaith, <hi>Our word toward you was not
yea and nay,</hi> and, <hi>the ſon of God, Jeſus Chriſt, who was preached
among you by us, was not yea and nay.</hi> I know the meaning of
the ſpeech, <hi>Our word towards you was not yea and nay,</hi> is not about
the uſing of theſe terms, <hi>yea and nay,</hi> but of the conſtancy of his
ſpeech and actions, as I expreſs it in my <hi>Serious Conſideration, p.</hi>
16. But I only ſhew me ſillineſs of <hi>Richard Hubberthorns</hi> talk,
ſith what he alledgeth, if underſtood as he ſeems to underſtand it,
would make againſt him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But</hi> Samuel Fiſher <hi>againſt my allegation of</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 31.
<hi>ſaith thus,</hi> And as for his ſaying <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is a particle of ſwearing, I ſay it
is not neceſsarily ſo, but oft of affirming only as quidem, profecto,
truly, verily, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And however where Paul uſes it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 31.
he does not ſwear (as <hi>J. T.</hi> divines he did) for ſith he, and all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
none are to ſwear by any but God alone; <hi>Pauls</hi> ſwearing there
(had it been an oath) had been unlawful, it being not by God, but by
his and the Corinthians rejoycing.</p>
            <p>To which I reply, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Grammarians make a particle of ſwean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
nor hath <hi>S. F.</hi> ſhewed any inſtance, where having an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſative
Caſe after it, as here, it is a particle of affirming without
ſwearing, and until he do ſo, it is neceſſarily here a particle of
ſwearing. Nor is it againſt the Confeſſion, <hi>That none are to ſwear
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:119289:10"/>
by any but God only.</hi> For in this oath he ſwears by God, when he
ſwears by his and the <hi>Corinthians</hi> rejoycing, it being an oath by
oppignoration, pawning, or execration, in which God is appealed
to as Judge, or avenger, as well as witneſs, by pawning to him,
and wiſhing the forfeiture of his rejoycing, or glorying in Chriſt
Jeſus, if what he ſaith were not true; as when we ſay, On my ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
it is ſo, as God help me, &amp;c. which I hope to clear more
fully, if ever I finiſh and publiſh my fuller Treatiſe about ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
forementioned. Hitherto <hi>Samuel Fiſher</hi>'s oppoſition hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
my Arguments againſt himſelf. I return to <hi>Richard Hub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berthorn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To my alledging to prove</hi> Paul'<hi>s ſwearing,</hi> Rom. 1. 9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9. 1.
Gal. 1. 20. Phil. 1. 8. Richard Hubberthorn <hi>thus ſaith,</hi> Is this a proof
for men to ſwear and take oaths for men, or againſt men? hath not
the man here lost the understanding of a man? thus to compare and
call this the Apoſtles oath, when he takes God to witneſs, that he
prayes for the Saints continually; is this an oath to testifie the truth
of his writing againſt lies? Indeed this we deſire, that <hi>John Tombs,</hi>
and the reſt of the Priests in this Nation, would write nothing but
what God would witneſs unto the truth of; and that they would
ſpeak truth, and not lie, then they would not thus abuſe the Apoſtles
words, when as the Apoſtles intend no ſuch thing in their words here
aſſerted. And whereas it is again ſaid, that the Apostle took an
oath, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 8. Now let all honeſt and ſober hearted men conſider,
whether the truth of God and the Apoſtles that ſpeak it forth, be not
abuſed, that from a Novice that is lifted up in pride, and would do
or ſay any thing for his hire, ſhould bring thoſe Scriptures to plead
for ſwearing, and that lawfulneſs of oaths; in all which the Apoſtle
took God to witneſs his love to the Saints, and labour in the work of
his Miniſtry, ſignifying that all underſtand how that he ſpoke the
truth, and did not lie, and kept to his yea and nay, according to
Chriſts doctrine (and did not ſwear at all.)</p>
            <p>I reply, 1. Thoſe Texts were not brought by me as a proof for
men to ſwear and take oaths for men or againſt men, but to prove
that ſome ſwearing in Goſpel-times may be lawful, ſith the Apoſtle
<hi>Paul,</hi> a man moved by the holy ſpirit, even in his holy writings
and ſpeeches did ſwear: which is enough againſt <hi>R. H.</hi> and his
complices, who deny any ſwearing lawful in any caſe. 2. I ſay,
that theſe ſpeeches [<hi>God is my witneſs, I ſpeak the truth in Chriſt,</hi>
I <hi>lie not, my conſcience alſo bearing me witneſs in the Holy Ghoſt,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:119289:10"/>
behold, before God</hi> I <hi>lie not, God is my record</hi>] are forms of ſwearing,
it being the definition of an oath, which all Writers that I know
of agree in, that an oath is an appeal to, or invocation of God, as
joint witneſs with us of the truth of our ſpeeches, and therefore in
this I write nothing, but what God will witneſs the truth of, I
ſpeak truth before God, without abuſing the Apoſtles words in
pleading for the lawfulneſs of ſome ſwearing; and in this I dare
ſtand to the arbitrement of ſober, honeſt-hearted, intelligent men,
not fearing the cenſure of <hi>R. H.</hi> as if I were a Novice, who have
been a profeſſor of Chriſtianity above forty years, and a Preacher
of the Goſpel above thirty, and wiſh <hi>R. H.</hi> do not accuſe me as lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
up with pride, with the like ſpirit as it is ſaid, that <hi>Diogenes</hi>
trampled on <hi>Plato</hi>'s pride with greater pride, there being not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
branches of pride greater then this, to take on him to judge the
ſecrets of anothers heart, and to foretel what he will do, it being
to behave himſelf as if he were God. Sure they that know me,
and judge of me with a charitable mind, they that have had experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of my adventures and loſſes for aſſerting truth, will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<hi>R. H.</hi> in what he here ſuggeſts, that I would do or ſay any
thing for hire, Who would thank <hi>R. H.</hi> if he would ſhew what
hire I have taken, which the words of Chriſt and his Apoſtle al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
not, <hi>Luke 10. 7. 1 Cor. 9. 7, 10, 11, 13, 14. 1 Tim.</hi> 5. 17,
18. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 6. But if he think his tongue is his own, that he may
accuſe and reproach at his pleaſure, I think it my duty to tell him,
that his practice is rayling and falſe accuſing; and that his tongue
is ſet on fire of hell, and that without repentance he ſhall not inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
the kingdom of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9, 10. He proceeds in the
ſame vein of reviling, cenſuring and falſe accuſing in his ſpeech of
my fifth Argument, to which he makes no anſwer but this, That
<hi>to break Chriſts command is of no neceſſary uſe; that</hi> I <hi>might as well
have stated my Argument, That to break Chriſts command is of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
to humane ſociety, therefore to break Chriſts command is lawful,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>and might thus have proved it, that except we break Chriſts
command, we cannot preach for hire, nor ſue men at law for tithes,
nor live in pride, eaſe and vanity, nor keep our places of profit and
benefits, which is neceſſary for our ſociety of Prieſts,</hi> Ergo. <hi>But we
whoſe eyes God hath opened, do ſee that all his book tends to perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of people to ſwear when Chriſt hath ſaid, Swear not at all, and
that which he would now ſwear for again, would ſwear againſt for
the ſame advantage and profits which he hath in his eye, yea, or he</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:119289:11"/>
would perſwade all men not to ſwear, and bring ſcripture to prove it
upon the ſame account, ſo that what he doth in this kind, is becauſe
of advantage: for two years ſince he did not preach this doctrine, nor
write thoſe arguments.</p>
            <p>To which I reply, The Lord rebuke thee: there's none of thy
accuſations of divinations here, after thy rayling faſhion, brought
by thee, which thou canſt prove by me, and thoſe that know me,
know it to be falſe which thou ſuggeſts concerning my ſeeking
gain, and ſuiting my actions thereto, and changing my doctrin.
There is no doctrin in that book thou here oppoſeſt, or the other of
the inſufficiency of light in each man, which hath not been my
conſtant doctrine. What thou wouldſt have imagined as if no
ſwearing were of neceſſary uſe to humane ſociety, is contrary to
all experience of governors of Kingdoms and Commonwealths, and
the Apoſtles words alledged by me, <hi>Heb. 6. 16. An oath for confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
is to men an end of all ſtrife.</hi> That which <hi>Samuel Fiſher</hi>
ſaith, <hi>That what ſwearing was then allowed of, (as before a ruler it
then was to end a ſtrife among men, who are yet in ſtrife) is now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
among his Saints, who are redeemed out of ſtrife, and the reſt
of thoſe fleſhly works, which it is one of,</hi> Gal. 5. is a ſilly ſhift. For,
1. The Saints are men. 2. Thoſe of the old Teſtament were
Saints, and yet were to ſwear. 3. If men, not Saints, may
ſwear to end ſtrife, then it is not prohibited by Chriſt to them to
ſwear in ſome caſes, and, ſith the precept of not ſwearing is not
limited to Saints, if others may ſwear in ſome caſes, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that precept, Saints may ſwear alſo. 4. Saints are redeemed
from other works of the fleſh, yet are not ſo redeemed, but that
they may have envyings, wrath, emulations. However Quakers
imagine themſelves perfect, yet the Scripture doth not ſay, that
the moſt eminent Saint is ſo redeemed out of ſtrife, but that he
may be tempted to, and guilty of ſome unlawfull ſtrife, while he is
in the body. 5. There was ſtrife between <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,
Acts 15. 39. Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter, Gal.</hi> 2. 11. the <hi>Corinthians, 1 Cor.</hi>
1. 11. Who were termed <hi>Saints, ver.</hi> 2. 6. Quakers are guilty
of ſtrifes in oppoſing Preachers and reviling diſſenters from them,
and therefore if it be neceſſary to end ſtrifes of men, that there be
oaths, it is alſo neceſſary to ſwear to end ſtrifes with them. Do
not they ſeek to recover ſtollen goods, due debts? and if ſo, oaths
are neceſſary for them. 7. Oftimes Saints are found ſo guilty of
contentions among themſelves, that, were not Magiſtrates im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powred
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:119289:11"/>
to compoſe them, they would be endleſs and remedileſs.
The ſtory of the libels brought to <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great at the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene</hi>
Council, of one Biſhop and Confeſſour againſt another, and
burnt by him, ſhewes, how ill it would fare with the beſt Saints, if
Magiſtracy did not quiet them. Our own times have had too
much experience of this. 8. Saints live among men unholy, to whom
they owe duties of love and righteouſneſs, which cannot be done
without teſtifying the truth in many caſes, wherein they differ, to
end their ſtrife; and therefore Saints are bound, when the laws re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
oaths, and they are the only witneſſes to give in evidence,
out of charity and juſtice to ſwear for ending of ſtrife.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Richard Hubberthorn</hi> addes ſomething againſt what I argue in
proof of the fourth Propoſition, omitting any ſhew of anſwer to
my ſixth Argument for my firſt Propoſition, and paſſing over the
ſecond and third. I alledged to prove this Propoſition, [<hi>That the
King is the only ſupreme Governor in all his Dominions</hi>] the example
and rule of Chriſt, <hi>Mat. 22. 21. 1 Tim. 6. 13. Luke</hi> 2. 51.
which he ſaith, I <hi>bring to prove an oath of Supremacy to King</hi> Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar;
which is not true, it being brought to prove a ſupremacy over
all perſons, not an oath of ſupremacy, and ſo all his anſwer is
impertinent. The Argument ſtands good. Chriſt himſelf did
acknowledge ſubjection to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and his parents, therefore no
Prelate is exempt from the Kings government.</p>
            <p>Richard Hubberthorn addes, John Tombes <hi>ſaith, That</hi> Paul <hi>a
Saint was ſubject to the judgement of</hi> Caeſar, <hi>and appealed to him,
then he acknowledged him ſupreme,</hi> &amp;c. Ergo. Anſ. Paul <hi>was a priſoner
for the word of God, and teſtimony of Jeſus, and appealed to</hi> Caeſar <hi>for
juſtice, becauſe he was unjuſtly accuſed, and had not done any thing
worthy of bonds or of death; therefore according to their law he
ought to be ſet free; but</hi> Paul <hi>did not call</hi> Caeſar <hi>the Supreme Head
of the Church, and chief Ruler in Eccleſiaſtical things, for if</hi> Caeſar <hi>had been the ſupreme Head of the Church, of which</hi> Paul <hi>was a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
he would but have needed little appealing unto for ſetting him at
liberty; but in ſuch Arguments as</hi> Tombes <hi>hath uſed, is manifeſt
the ignorance of fooliſh men, wherein their folly appeareth to all men,
as the Scripture ſaith,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 9.</p>
            <p>I reply, 'Tis true, I alledged <hi>Pauls</hi> example, <hi>Acts</hi> 25. 8, 10.
to prove the King Supreme Governor over all perſons in his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
and <hi>Acts</hi> 23. 29. and 24. 5, 6, 8, 10. and 25. 8, 11,
19, 21. and 26. 2, 3. to prove him Governor in all Cauſes, or
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:119289:12"/>
Chief Ruler in Eccleſiaſtical things, not to prove <hi>Caeſar Supreme
Head of the Church,</hi> as <hi>R. H.</hi> miſrepreſents me. Now he ſhews
not any defect in my proof taken from matter of fact related in
the Text, but tels us, <hi>If</hi> Caeſar <hi>had been Supreme Head of the
Church, of which</hi> Paul <hi>was a member, he would have needed little
appealing,</hi> which is to alter the concluſion, and to ſay nothing to
that point which was in queſtion, nor to anſwer the proof at all,
which all that know the rules of arguing know to be ridiculous,
and indeed very fooliſh.</p>
            <p>Speeding no better in anſwering my Arguments, <hi>R. H.</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
to his wonted courſe of invectives againſt my perſon, which
I am neceſſitated to take notice of, becauſe they are impediments
to many, of receiving the truth I teach, and do ſo fill people with
prejudice, that their ears are ſtopped from hearkning to the cleareſt
demonſtrations, and they are carried away with the vain conceits
of Quakers, and other blind guides. He tels me, <hi>That my Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
if received would beget men from their holy and harmleſs ſtate
into tranſgreſsion of Chriſts command, and from the tenderneſs of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
into hardneſs of heart,</hi> and ſaith, When I ſay the Oath of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy
was impoſed for excluding of the Popes juriſdiction, &amp;c.
<hi>if ſo, why doſt thou preach it up to be impoſed upon the holy, harmleſs,
godly Chriſtians, who are redeemed from the Popes power and juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
that</hi> I <hi>am a miſerable comforter to tender conſciences, that
my end is ſeen, and therefore cannot deceive many, that thoſe holy
perſons who are tender of an oath, ought to be my teachers, who am
far from righteouſneſs or tenderneſs of conſcience, that it is a ſhame for
me to be an impoſer of oaths upon tender conſciences, who profeſs my
ſelf a Minister of Chriſt, that it is manifeſt my Miniſtry is to bring
people into condemnation,</hi> in which he falſly accuſeth me, that I <hi>am
an impoſer of oaths upon tender conſciences,</hi> that I <hi>preath it up to be
impoſed upon the holy, harmleſs, godly Chriſtians,</hi> becauſe to free
them from the ſnare, which the Law of the Land brings them into
by reaſon of their denying to take the Oaths of Supremacy and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance,
I have endeavoured out of compaſſion to their ſouls, to
prove to them, that ſuch ſwearing may be lawful: It is not I that
<hi>impoſe the Oaths on them,</hi> but the Law and the Officers that are
to execute it; nor did I <hi>preach it up to be impoſed on tender conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,</hi>
but after it was impoſed on them by others, and my Petition
with others to his Majeſty for the releaſe thereof without the deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
effect, I did upon adviſe and importunity, publiſh the writing
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:119289:12"/>
about it, to free them from miſtakes, who ſcrupled the thing, there
being then in appearance, no other way for the liberty and help
of many then impriſoned, and more liable to impriſonment for
their refuſal to ſwear, then by ſhewing them the lawfulneſs of
that, for denying of which they ſuffered, and therefore they
might without danger to their ſouls, and much benefit to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in their outward eſtate, take an expedite courſe for their
peace. Which charity (that <hi>thinketh no evil,</hi> that <hi>hopeth all
things, believeth all things, 1 Cor.</hi> 13. 5. 7.) if there had been
any in <hi>R. H.</hi> would not have conſtrued to have been done to
any evil end, but out of love and mercy to men for their good,
and for the great advantage of them that are of the ſame judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with me in point of baptiſm, that it may not be imputed
to them as their common tenent, that they allow no Oaths,
no not in judicial proceedings, which is interpreted as tending to
the overthrow of all civil Government, and ſo the perſons coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
intolerable, which hath cauſed, and is yet likely to cauſe
great perſecution to thoſe that hold the truth about baptiſm. In
which thing I bleſs God I have not been ſo <hi>miſerable a comforter,</hi>
but that I know my ſelf of many, and am told of more hundreds,
yea thouſands, who have had their liberty and their families, ſaved
from ruine, by reaſon of the clearing of the point to them in that
book; and, if ſome after their ſwearing have been diſquieted in
ſpirit becauſe of their Oath, it is not to be imputed to that book,
but their own weakneſs, or ſuch affrightments as <hi>R. H.</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
do put upon them. I refuſe not to be taught by <hi>R. H.</hi> or
any other, but, ſure I am, in this thing <hi>R. H.</hi> yields me no light
to rectifie me, but by his falſe accuſations of me, as <hi>far from righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
as bringing men into condemnation by my Miniſtry,</hi> &amp;c.
gives me occaſion to fear that he is led by an evil ſpirit, ſo veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
a tongue diſcovering a malicious poiſoned heart.</p>
            <p>My anſwer to the grand objection from <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 34, 35, 36,
37. <hi>James</hi> 5. 12. was, that there muſt of neceſſity be ſome limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Chriſts ſpeech, as of the next ſpeech, <hi>ver.</hi> 38, 39, 40, 41,
42. and many more places, which I then did not recite, but ſhall
now refer the Reader to ſome of them, <hi>Mat. 5. 29, 30. Mat. 6.
17, 19. 25. 34. Mat. 7. 1. Mat. 10. 28. Mat. 23. 3, 8, 9.
Luke 6. 30. John</hi> 6. 27. which with many more if they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
without limitation, would croſs other Texts of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and ſuch truths as are undeniable, and introduce ſuch evils
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:119289:13"/>
as are intolerable. And that <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 34, 35, 36, 37. is to be
limited, I proved it from the Angels and <hi>Pauls</hi> ſwearing and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring
after that precept, which ſhews they underſtood it with
limitation, and ſo are we to underſtand it, and that it is to be limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as I there ſet down, I proved from the words of the Text,
there and elſewhere. Hereto <hi>R. H.</hi> ſpeaketh thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Indeed it doth plainly appear, that thou muſt of neceſsity either
diſprove Chriſts words, or elſe deny thy own, ſeeing they are contrary
the one to the other: ſo therefore thou ſaiſt, that it was thoſe oaths
above mentioned, that was forbidden by Chriſt and the Apoſtles, and
I ſhall ſhew it plainly, that thou haſt no neceſsity to limit Chriſts
words to vain and prophane ſwearing; (but only that thou wouldſt
have thy words true, and his falſe) for Chriſts words in</hi> Mat. 5. <hi>do
not intend ſuch oaths, for he ſpeaks of the true oaths which was uſed
among the Jews, and ſuch oaths as Chriſt told them they were to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form;
for it was not ſaid in old time, that they ſhould perform vain,
light, prophane, unneceſſary, cuſtomary, and paſsionate oaths, but ſuch
as they were to perform betwixt the Lord and them, and the ſolemn
Vows and Covenants which they made in old time to their Kings, and
one to another, the Chriſtians now by the command of Chriſt was not,
to ſwear theſe oaths, neither any oath true nor falſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I reply, 'Tis true, Chriſt ſpake of true oaths to be
performed to the Lord, as the occaſion of his precept did lead him
to ſpeak: But it is true alſo, that our Lord Chriſt forbids not ſuch
oaths univerſally, nor as they were uſed in old time among the
Jews, and to their kings, and one unto another; but as the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees
and other teachers interpreted what was ſaid to them of old
time, that what was ſaid to them, did bind no further then not to
break their oaths, but to perform them to the Lord, otherwiſe
they might ſwear as oft as they would, and in what manner they
pleaſed: But this Chriſt denied, and determines they might not
ſwear frequently, unneceſſarily, with ſuch oaths as they uſed, and
conceits of the obligation of ſome, and not others, as the Text
leads us to conceive; and the reaſons by me given, prove the
words are to be limited, to which <hi>R. H.</hi> hath given no anſwer,
and therefore my anſwer and whole diſpute ſtands good, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the oppoſition of <hi>R. H.</hi> and <hi>S. F.</hi> And for the inſinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of <hi>R. H.</hi> that this is <hi>preaching of the lawfulneſs of ſwearing (or
ſinning) againſt Chriſts command,</hi> and that <hi>ſuch teachers are given
to change with every government, and that they preach as the falſe
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:119289:13"/>
prophets did for handfuls of barley and pieces of bread,</hi> they are but
a further continuation of his revilings, it being no teaching againſt,
but expounding of Chriſts command; nor have we changed our
doctrine or principles with change of government, but ſhewed
ſubjection to the powers that be, as <hi>Paul</hi> injoins, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1, 2.
Nor do we look at wages any otherwiſe, then we are allowe nor
conceive we are bound by any law of Chriſt or his Apoſtles, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
or neglect more liberal maintenance, be it by tithes or other
pay aſſigned by law, then that which is by meer alms or voluntary
contribution, which in moſt places is ſo ſcant, that perſons of
worth are neceſſitated to live in a ſordid manner, or people are
neceſſitated to take perſons of little worth, and thereby the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry
is debaſed, the people untaught or ill taught, ſuch ignorant
and corrupt men, as <hi>R. H.</hi> ſeems to be by his writing, creep in
among men, and pervert them.</p>
            <p>That which <hi>R. H.</hi> ſaith, the <hi>Jews ſware by the living God, but
the Apoſtates by the book,</hi> inſinuates, as if ſuch were apoſtates as
ſwear thus, and that they ſwear by the book, and not by the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
God. But neither doth he prove, that they who teach the
lawfulneſs of ſome ſwearing, are apoſtates from Chriſtianity, any
more then holy <hi>Paul,</hi> who hath left upon record in holy Scripture,
his oaths, after he was an Apoſtle; nor is this form of ſwearing,
<hi>So help me God, and by the Contents of this book,</hi> any other then
ſwearing by the living God, made known in that book, and paw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
our intereſt in his help, according to the doctrine and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
in that book, expreſſed by laying the hand on the book, as
formerly by <hi>coming before the altar, 1 Kings 8. 31. 2 Chron.</hi> 6. 22.
as a ſign of our abandoning our intereſt in Gods help, made known
in that book, if we ſpeak not truth.</p>
            <p>I find in an <hi>humble petition of ſome priſoners in Maidſton,</hi> da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>January 25.</hi> that <hi>they cannot acknowledge any authority that God
hath given the King in ſpiritual things or cauſes;</hi> and they thus ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue:
<hi>If thou haſt any power to be a Lord over our faith, or by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
force to impoſe any thing in the worſhip of God on our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
it is given unto thee as thou art a Magiſtrate, or as thou art a
Chriſtian; but thou haſt no ſuch power given unto thee of God as thou
art a Magiſtrate, appears, 1. Becauſe if Magiſtrates as ſuch,
have ſuch an authority, then all Magistrates in all Nations have
the ſame power: In</hi> Turky <hi>I muſt be a Mahometan, in</hi> Spain <hi>a
Papiſt; and for ever as the authority changes Religion, <hi>I</hi> muſt do</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:119289:14"/>
               <hi>the ſame. 2. Becauſe the Apoſtles refuſed to be obedient to their
rulers, when they were commanded to forbear that which they judged
part of the worſhip of God,</hi> Acts 4. 19. Acts 5. 29. 3.  <hi>All the
Scriptures of the new Teſtament that injoyns obedience unto Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrutes,
were written when the Romans had the Empire of the world,
whoſe Emperours were for the moſt part (if not all) heatheniſh ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters
for the firſt 300 years, until</hi> Conſtantine<hi>'s time; it therefore
cannot be ſuppoſed, that any of theſe Texts of Scripture that calls for
obedience to Magiſtrates, intends an obedience in matters of faith or
worſhip, for then the Chriſtians that lived under thoſe Emperours,
muſt needs have denied Christ, and worſhipped the Roman gods, as
ſome of the Emperours commanded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though in my <hi>Serious Conſideration of the Oath of the
Kings Supremacy,</hi> there is that ſaid which might have prevented
this objection, yet being willing to clear the truth more fully, I
ſay, 1. That it is not rightly ſuppoſed, That <hi>by outward force
any thing in the worſhip of God, may be impoſed on mens conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi>
For though by outward force, things may be impoſed on the
outward man, and the actions of ſome of the members, yet by
outward force a thing cannot be impoſed on the conſcience. For
then only is a thing impoſed on the conſcience, when the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is convinced, that he ought to do, or not to do it, which muſt
be done by doctrine, or ſome other way inſinuating into the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
the neceſſity or lawfulneſs of doing or not doing a thing, which
outward force cannot perform. 2. That it is a greater miſtake,
<hi>That the King in the Oath of Supremacy, is acknowledged to have
power to be a Lord over faith, or by outward force to impoſe any
thing in the worſhip of God, on mens conſciences.</hi> This miſtake
might have been rectified, if they had heeded the Oath, Proviſo,
Admonition, 37th. Article prefixed before my book, and the
explication of the 5th. and 6th. Propoſitions, which I gave con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formably
to the ſpeeches of learned approved men, by the Princes
that have been and are, which I find not yet any perſons in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
have diſallowed; and yet I conceive by their words in the
end of their petition, they were not ignorant thereof, ſith they
cite the proviſo of the Statute 5. <hi>Eliz.</hi> and the admonition, which I
preſume they found printed in my book. By which they might
have underſtood, that Kings are acknowledged Governors in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
things, as well, and no otherwiſe as in temporal things. Now
in temporal things they have not power to impoſe any thing on
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:119289:14"/>
mens conſciences by outward force, not is the King a Lord over
our faith in temporal things; ſo as that if he ſhould tell us we may
marry our brothers wife, or command us to fight a duel for our
honour, we may think we are bound in conſcience to do it, or
that we may lawfully do it, much leſs that he is Lord over our
faith in the things of God, ſo as to impoſe on our conſciences what
we ſhall believe concerning God, Chriſt, the Covenant of grace,
the doctrine of ſalvation, &amp;c. or to form the worſhip of God by
addition or diminution, otherwiſe then is appointed by Gods
word, but as Dr. <hi>Rainold</hi>'s Confer. with <hi>Hart, chap.</hi> 10. cites the
words of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> which I find in the ſeventh Tome of his
works, in the third book againſt <hi>Creſconius</hi> the Grammarian, <hi>chap.</hi>
51. more fully then in the fiftieth <hi>Epiſtle, For in this kings, as it
is commanded them by God, ſerved God as they are Kings, if in their
Kingdom they command good things, and forbid evil things, not only
which pertain to humane ſociety, but alſo which pertain to the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of God.</hi> And as they are not to govern in temporal things,
but according to juſt Laws of the Commonwealth, ſo neither in
the things of God, but according to the holy Laws of God; and
although they have more authority in making and executing Laws
in Civil things, then in Religious, yet in neither to make or exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
Laws contrary to Gods Laws, nor to uſurp that prerogative
which belongs to God to diſpenſe with his Laws, or to hinder the
doing of a duty impoſed in the firſt or ſecond table of the Law, or
to mould or urge doctrines of faith or worſhip, otherwiſe then
God in Scripture declares or appoints; nor do we acknowledge by
taking that Oath, that we owe them active obedience, if they urge
us by Laws and Edicts thereto, in things reſerved to Gods prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,
or ſuch as are contrary to his Laws in force, only we are
to yield paſſive obedience by ſuffering, and not reſiſting the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and authority thus abuſed. Nor is there any thing in the words
of Q. <hi>Elizabeths Admonition annexed to her injunctions,</hi> contrary
to this explication. For the Queen doth not ſay, that <hi>She chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged
by that Oath, ſuch a power as was challenged by her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
King</hi> Henry <hi>the eighth, which was, to burn his ſubjects at the
ſtake for their diſſenting from him in religious matters:</hi> But She
ſaith, <hi>That nothing was, is, or ſhall be meant or intended by the ſame
Oath, to have any other duty, allegiance, or bond required by the
ſame Oath, then was acknowledged to be due to the moſt Noble Kings
of famous memory, King</hi> Henry <hi>the eighth Her Majeſties Father,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:119289:15"/>
or King</hi> Edward <hi>the ſixth, Her Majeſties Brother.</hi> And again:
<hi>For certainly her Majeſty neither doth, ne ever will challenge any
other authority, then that was challenged, and lately uſed by the
ſaid Noble Kings of famous memory, King</hi> Henry <hi>the eighth, and
King</hi> Edward <hi>the ſixth, which is, and was of ancient time due to the
Imperial Crown of this Realm; that is, under God to have the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verainty
and Rule over all manner of perſons, born within theſe Her
Realms, Dominions and Countries, of what eſtate, either Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical
or temporal, ſoever they be, ſo as no other forrein power ſhall,
or ought to have any ſuperiority over them.</hi> Now if She had chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged
power to burn at a ſtake her ſubjects, for their diſſenting
from King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth in religious matters, then ſhe muſt
challenge power to burn all his Proteſtant ſubjects at a ſtake, and
therefore ſhe muſt be conceived to challenge only authority over
all perſons to govern them according to juſt Laws, excluding for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein
power. Whereto agree both the words of the 37th. Article,
ſet down in my former book, and the word of King <hi>James</hi> in this,
That in <hi>that Oath only is contained the Kings abſolute power to be
Judge over all perſons, as well Civil as Eccleſiaſtical, excluding all
forrein powers and Potentates, to be Judges within his Dominions.</hi>
Nor is it true, That by <hi>King</hi> Henries <hi>practice appears, that Q.</hi>
Elizabeth <hi>challenged power to burn diſſenters from King</hi> Henry <hi>in
matters of Religion.</hi> For ſhe did not challenge all the power, which
King <hi>Henry</hi> practiſed, for then ſhe ſhould have challenged a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to behead her mother, which he practiſed, and if the <hi>Queen
her ſelf exerciſed the ſame authority</hi> (though it be not to be called
authority or power truly, but an uſurpation or abuſe of power) <hi>in
putting ſome to death for their conſcience in Religion,</hi> yet doubtleſs
ſhe challenged no other power then what before <hi>had been or might
be lawfully exerciſed or uſed,</hi> as the words are in the Statute 1.
<hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 1. a little before the Oath of Supremacy, nor doth the Oath
acknowledge the King Governor, or to have any other power or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to be aſſiſted, defended or actively obeyed, then as it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and uſed or exerciſed lawfully, and therefore in anſwer to the
three Arguments of the Petitioners, I ſay, 1. That by the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement
of the Kings Supremacy in ſpirituals, as a Magiſtrate
neither is a man bound to change his Religion as the King doth,
nor to forbear Gods worſhip which he forbids, nor to deny Chriſt,
or worſhip other Gods becauſe he commands it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It followes in the</hi> Maidſton <hi>priſoners Petition.</hi> And now, O
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:119289:15"/>
King, that no man as he is a Christian, hath power to be a Lord
over anothers faith, or by outward force to impoſe any thing in the
worſhip of God, is as clear, 1. Becauſe the Lord Jeſus himſelf, nor
his diſciples, would never by any outward force compel men to receive
them or their doctrine; for when the diſciples of Chriſt (ſuppoſing
they might uſe violence as under the law) would have commanded
fire to come from heaven (as Elias did) to conſume them that would
not receive them; Chriſt turned and rebuked, ſaying, ye know not
what ſpirit ye are of, for the Son of man is not come to deſtroy mens
lives, but to ſave them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To be Governor in things and cauſes ſpiritual and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical,
is aſcribed to the King as King, and not as a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
for a Chriſtian as a Chriſtian hath not the Government of any
others beſides himſelf in any cauſes, and he is Governor in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical
cauſes, as well as temporal: But he is not governor in
temporal things as a Chriſtian, but as a King; although it is true,
that a Chriſtian is better fitted to govern in both cauſes, in that he
is a Chriſtian, his Chriſtianity by framing his ſpirit to wiſedom, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
clemency, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> producing more aptitude to govern, though not
more authority, and therefore were there not in this part of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
ſundry miſtakes, by which thoſe Petitioners incommodate,
and harm themſelves and others; and there ſeems to be ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
on my book of the Serious conſideration of the Oath of the
Kings Supremacy, I ſhould let this paſs: But for theſe reaſons I
ſhall a little examine what is ſaid.</p>
            <p>1. The miſtake is continued, as if by acknowledging the King
ſupreme Governor in ſpiritual things, he had a power given him
to be Lord over anothers faith, which were indeed to aſcribe that
to the King, which the Pope takes on him, to determine what a
Chriſtian is to believe, which <hi>Hart</hi> the Jeſuite imagined was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the King by that Oath, but was rectified therein by Dr. <hi>John
Rainold confer. with Hart, chap.</hi> 10.</p>
            <p>2. If [<hi>by impoſing by outward force, any thing in the worſhip of
God</hi>] be meant of impoſing on the conſcience, the ſame miſtake is
continued, which I have before diſcovered: But if [<hi>by outward
force impoſing any thing in the worſhip of God</hi>] be meant of
[impoſing by civil penalties on the outward man, ſomething
in Gods worſhip] there is need of much caution to determine of
their power. Civil penalties are greater, as death, baniſhment,
mutilation, impriſonment, ſpoiling of eſtate, liberty of trade, &amp;c.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:119289:16"/>
Or leſs, as ſome ſmall diminution of priviledges, office, &amp;c. The
things impoſed on men may be either the commands, or plain
inſtitutions of Chriſt, or ſome things deviſed by men, as Councils,
Fathers, Prelates, &amp;c. And theſe impoſitions may be either in
circumſtances of time, place, order, which are undetermined by
Chriſt, or in ſuch points of doctrine or worſhip, as are of greater
moment, and determined by Chriſt. The impoſitions may be ſuch,
as are termed by the Apoſtle, <hi>hay and ſtubble,</hi> or ſuch as over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
the foundation which is laid, <hi>which is Jeſus Chriſt, 1 Cor.</hi> 3.
11, 12. ſuch as are impoſitions tending to Idolatry, Superſtition,
Profaneneſs, hereſies of perdition, blaſphemy. The impoſition may
be on Teachers or Learners, ſtronger or weaker Chriſtians, to be
ſubſcribed to, or taught, or to be conformed to, or profeſſed, and
this to be done either by bare preſence, which infers no conſent,
or by ſome act which ſhews conſent. It cannot be denied, but
that Kings by reaſon of their errour and rigour, have very ſadly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried
in their impoſitions on Chriſtian brethren in matters of
faith and worſhip, there having been many miſtakes in the beſt
Councils, Fathers, Prelates and learned men, ſince the Apoſtles
days, who have ſeldome been ſo equal, as to permit thoſe they
have been prejudiced againſt, to debate freely and fully what they
hold; nor are they heard with that equanimity, which were requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite.
And therefore Princes, Parliaments, Republiques, have
made many hard Laws, and done innumerable unrighteous execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
to ſhedding of much innocent blood, and moſt heavy op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
of men, either guiltleſs, or not deſerving ſuch ſevere
penalties as they have indured. I think Kings and Parliaments
who ſee not much with their own eyes, but are fain to uſe the
judgements of Learned men and Prelates, who are often partial
through prejudice or intereſt, or not ſtudied in the points about
which they advice, do often ſtand in a very ſlippery place; and
that Law-makers and Officers of juſtice have need of very much
circumſpection and tenderneſs, ere they make penal Laws in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
of Religion, that they ſhould not make hereſie by the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
of any Councils ſince the Apoſtles days, nor urge ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions
and conformity under civil penalties, but in things
plainly ſet down in holy Scripture, that ſo much liberty to diſſents
and different uſages ſhould be given, as may ſtand with peace.
Yet that Kings ſhould uſe no civil penalties on men for any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
or errours in any matters of ſaith or worſhip of God, I am
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:119289:16"/>
not yet convinced by any thing I have read, much leſs by the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
of theſe Petitioners.</p>
            <p>Not by the firſt. For a King may do that which our Lord Chriſt
in his ſtate of humiliation would not do. <hi>He would not divide an
inheritance among brethren, Luke</hi> 12. 13, 14. and yet a king may
do it. For though Chriſt was King in right, yet he refuſed at
that time to take upon him, or to execute the office of a King, but
<hi>took upon him the form of a ſervant, Phil.</hi> 2. 7. And therefore a
King on his throne is not debarred from doing that which Chriſt
would not do in his debaſement. And yet even then the Lord
Chriſt <hi>did whip the buyers and ſellers out of the Temple, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw
the tables of the money-changers,</hi> John 2. 15, 16. Mat. 21.
12. I will not now diſpute, whether Chriſt did this <hi>jure zelota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi>
by the right that Zelots of the Law among the Jews, claimed
to themſelves; or <hi>jure Regio,</hi> by the right of a King, under which
notion acclamation was made to him when he rode on an Aſs into
<hi>Jeruſalem, Luke</hi> 19. 38. after which he did expel the buyers and
ſellers out of the Temple, <hi>ver.</hi> 45. nor whether this be a good
proof for Magiſtrates, to intermeddle in matters of Religion,
as it hath been argued by Mr. <hi>Cobbet</hi> of <hi>New England.</hi> It is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
for my preſent purpoſe, that the alledging of Chriſts ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
by theſe Petitioners, is ſo far from making againſt the
Kings power in Eccleſiaſtical cauſes, that it rather makes for it.
Nor is it againſt the Kings power in cauſes Eccleſiaſtical that the
<hi>Lord Jeſus himſelf, nor his diſciples, never would by any outward
force compel men to receive them or their doctrine.</hi> For, beſides
what is already ſaid of Chriſts example, there is a great difference
to be made between profeſſed infidels, and diſorderly Chriſtians;
between planting of the Goſpel at firſt, and reſorming Chriſtians
who have in ſhew received it, there may be reaſon to do the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
by civil penalties, though not the former, though men are not
to be made Chriſtians by civil penalties, ſith Religion is not to be
inforced, but perſwaded, yet being Chriſtians they may be corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by civil penalties. As the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> though he ſaid, <hi>what
have I to do to judge them that are without? 1 Cor.</hi> 5. 12. yet
did not exclude Eccleſiaſtical penalties on them that are within;
no more are they that are within, freed from civil penalties in ſome
things Eccleſiaſtical, becauſe they are within, though perhaps they
that are without, are not to be compelled to come in. And yet
it is not proved, that a King may not uſe ſome civil penalties,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:119289:17"/>
eſpecially denying of favours and priviledges to them that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
not the faith, or rather, it is certain, he ought ſo to put a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between Chriſtians and infidels, godly Chriſtians and
profane looſe ones, that the former may have that encouragement
and benefit, which others have not, according to <hi>Davids</hi> example,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 101. which a King ought to follow.</p>
            <p>As for the ſpeech of Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 54, 55, 56. it ſerves
much leſs for the Petitioners purpoſe.</p>
            <p>For 1. The reaſon of the diſciples deſire of calling fire from
heaven, was not their not receiving them or their doctrine as
Chriſtian, but as Jews. For the <hi>Samaritans did not receive Chriſt,
becauſe his face was as though he would go to Jeruſalem,</hi> ver. 53.
which ſhews, that their not receiving him, was out of the hatred
they bare to him as a Jew, and to the worſhip which was at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi>
according to what we read of the <hi>Samaritans, Joh.</hi> 4. 9,
20. &amp; 8. 48. And therefore this is not to the preſent purpoſe
of Chriſts denying power to the Civil Magiſtrate, to inflict civil
penalties on the non-receivers of his doctrine.</p>
            <p>2. The fact of the <hi>Samaritans</hi> was far different from the fact
of the Captains that came to take <hi>Elijah, 2 Kings 1. chap.</hi> For
they came to take <hi>Elijah</hi> to deſtroy him, theſe only did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
Chriſt, thoſe doubtleſs were worſhippers of <hi>Baal,</hi> and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to uphold idolatry, and to perſecute the
Prophets and Worſhippers of the true God, which made them
more juſtly objects of wrath and Divine vengeance then the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans</hi>
were.</p>
            <p>3. That which the diſciples would have had fall on the <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans,</hi>
was <hi>fire from heaven to deſtroy them,</hi> which was too great
a puniſhment for that neglect: But this doth not prove that a leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
and proportionable penalty, may not be inflicted on ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly
Chriſtians by a Civil Magiſtrate.</p>
            <p>4. The diſciples were but private perſons, and were carried with
a private and ſelfiſh ſpirit, even the deſire of private revenge, and
therefore Chriſt rebukes them, as not minding with what ſpirit
they were moved; which hinders not but that a publique Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
<hi>ex zelo juſtitiae,</hi> with a publique ſpirit out of zeal of juſtice,
may inflict ſome proportionable civil penalties on Chriſtians, who
are his ſubjects for ſome offences in ſpiritual or Eccleſiaſtical
things or cauſes.</p>
            <p>But, ſay the Petitioners, <hi>2. If any men under heaven have had</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:119289:17"/>
               <hi>any ſuch power in the dayes of the Goſpel, the Apoſtles and Elders in
the Primitive times muſt needs have had it, but this they diſowned.
The Apoſtle</hi> Paul <hi>in</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 24. <hi>ſaith thus, Not for that we have
dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy, for by faith
you ſtand; yea the Lord Jeſus when they ſtrove for Domination,
forbids it, ſaying, ye know that the Princes of the Gentiles exerciſe
dominion over them, and they that are great do exerciſe authority
upon them, but it ſhall not be ſo amongſt you,</hi> Mat. 20. 25, 26. <hi>even
ſo ſaith</hi> Peter, <hi>ſpeaking to the Elders, Feed the flock of God which
is amongſt you, taking the overſight thereof, not by conſtraint, but wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly;
not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind, neither as being
Lords over Gods heritage, but being examples to the flock,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.
2, 3. <hi>And in truth the Apoſtles and diſciples were not to uſe any exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
force to carry on their maſters work, but only by ſhewing the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
of the Lord were to perſwade men; and in caſe of reſiſtance to

what we ſhall believe, what not, ſo as that if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
not, we ſin againſt God, and are liable to his wrath, is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to Chriſt the great Prophet of the Church, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 22, 23.
To the Apoſtles themſelves, Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Mat. 23. 10. Neither
be ye called Maſters, for one is your Maſter, even Chriſt.</hi> Neither
the Pope, nor any Council of Biſhops or Elders, much leſs Kings
and Parliaments (who take not upon them to be teachers in the
Church) can preſcribe to us our Creed, or form of Worſhip of
God, any otherwiſe then Chriſt and his Apoſtles from him, have
delivered them to us. Nor doth the Oath of Supremacy aſcribe to
them ſuch power and authority, but it hath been diſclaimed, as is
before ſhewed. Nevertheleſs Princes may require thoſe under
their Dominions, to worſhip God in Chriſt, according to the
plain direction of the Scriptures of the new Teſtament; and if
they ſet up idols; blaſpheme the God of heaven, &amp;c. may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
civil puniſhment, they may forbid and puniſh the teaching of
ſome doctrines, tending to the reproach of Religion, deſtructive
of Chriſtianity, of Civil Government, provided they be very wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that they do not judge by any other then the plain declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the holy Scripture, and not by the authority of any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
or Fathers, ſith as it is in the 21. Article of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
General Councils have erred and may erre, in things pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to God,</hi> and the puniſhment be ſo proportioned and qualified,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:119289:18"/>
as may agree with juſtice, equity, prudence, clemency, and other
vertues requiſite in them that rule over others. Nor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> that which
is here alledged, of validity to diſprove it. For 1. <hi>It is not
rightly ſuppoſed, that Princes have not in the days of the Goſpel, a
power in matters of Religion, which the Apoſtles and Elders in the
Primitive times, had not.</hi> The contrary is proved in my <hi>Serious
Conſideration of the Oath of Supremacy,</hi> in the confirmation of the
4th. and 5th. Propoſitions. The Apoſtles and Elders, as meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
of Chriſt, and Paſtors of the Church, had their peculiar au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
which Princes are not to uſurp; and Princes have their
peculiar power and authority, to which <hi>every ſoul is to be ſubject:</hi>
neither have dominion over our faith; and, however Popes claim
it, our Princes diſclaim it. 2. The Text <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 25, 26. is
rightly urged by Proteſtants againſt the Popes uſurpation, as I ſhew
in my <hi>Romaniſm diſcuſſed, Art. 7. Sect.</hi> 8. but not rightly urged
againſt Chriſtians, being civil Magiſtrates, nor againſt Princes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
governors over all perſons in their dominions, in ſpiritual
things. That which is there forbidden, is rule in the Apoſtles
over one another, after the manner of the Kings of the Nations.
3. The Text, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 2, 3. is much leſs to the purpoſe, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only a precept to Teachers and Elders of the Church, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the exerciſe of their Eccleſiaſtical function, nothing to the
reſtraint of Princes from the exerciſe of their office, in things and
cauſes ſpiritual. 4. The Apoſtles only perſwading, ſhewing the
terrours of the Lord, ſhaking off the duſt of their feet, are ill
alledged to exclude Princes from their power of governing all
perſons in all cauſes. The Apoſtles and Elders did not bear the
ſword as Princes do. It would be of very bad conſequence, if in
caſe of reſiſtance they might do no more then the Apoſtles were to
do in caſe their doctrine were received or oppoſed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is added by the Petitioners, thus.</hi> 3. It is very plain, that
the Lord Jeſus himſelf in his parable of the tares and wheat, forbids
any force to be exerciſed upon falſe worſhippers, as ſuch; for by the
tares which he forbids the pulling up, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 29. cannot be inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the tranſgreſſors of the ſecond Table, ſuch as thieves, murderers,
&amp;c. becauſe all confeſs with one conſent, that the Magiſtrates au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
reaches ſuch, but thoſe that Chriſt Jeſus would have remain
amongſt his wheat, in the field of the world, are the children of the
wicked one through Idolatry and will-worſhip; this will further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
if the 28, 29, 30. <hi>ver.</hi> be compared with the 38, 39. of the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:119289:18"/>
ſame Chapter; and the reaſon the Lord Jeſus gives, why both tares
and wheat muſt grow together, (O King, that it were engraven with
the point of a diamond, and often laid before thee) is, leaſt in ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
up the tares, the wheat alſo be rooted up with them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Parables are a way of teaching, much uſed of old in the
Eaſtern Countries, as appears by <hi>Jotham</hi>'s parable, <hi>Judg. 9. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans</hi>
parable, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. and they are narrations of things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
never done, yet related as if they had been ſo acted as they
are told, that by the reſemblance, the thing intended may more
eaſily inſinuate it ſelf into the minds of the perſons to be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by the parable. Now there are in ſuch parables, two parts,
the one the deviſed ſtory, the other the intended doctrine to be
learnt by it, which is ſometimes opened, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. which we
term the application or explication, and ſometimes left to be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
by the auditors, as <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 16, &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 11, &amp;c.
and even <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 31, 32, 33, 44, 45, 46. In the deviſed ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
are many things inſerted, as lace in a garment, or carvings in a
building, or pictures in a Map, which are only for comelineſs in
the ſpeech, more handſome dreſs of the ſpeech, or filling it up, and
yet are not doctrinal, nor argumentative, as from the parable,
<hi>Luke</hi> 16. 23, 24, 25. it would be vain to teach men, that thoſe
in hell may ſee thoſe in <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome, and ſpeak one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And therefore it is a rule in Divinity, that ſuch ſymboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
expreſſions are not argumentative any further then their appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
explication or ſcope, appears to be. Now the parable,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30. being diſtinctly opened
by Chriſt, from <hi>ver.</hi> 36. to 44. it is unſafe to conclude any more
from it, then Chriſt hath done in his explication. I know this
paſſage, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 29, 30. hath been much urged for the tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of men, corrupt in matters of faith and worſhip by the civil
Magiſtrate, without civil penalties, ſpecially ſuch as are deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
of mens being. But, what ever be ſaid of the concluſion,
this Text ſerves not to the purpoſe. For 1. It is no part of the
application or explication, <hi>ver.</hi> 36. to <hi>ver.</hi> 44. and therefore is
to be counted only a filling up of the deviſed ſtory, and therefore
not doctrinal or argumentative. 2. There is no proof, That by
<hi>the children of the wicked one,</hi> ver. 38. are meant only Idolaters
and wil-worſhippers: Yea theſe reaſons ſeem to prove that others
are meant, to wit, wicked men, who are tranſgreſſors of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Table of the Law, as well as the firſt. 1. That the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:119289:19"/>
of the wicked one, are <hi>ver.</hi> 41. termed all <hi>ſcandals,</hi> or <hi>things
that do offend, and them that do iniquity, or that which is not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to Gods Law.</hi> 2. John 8. 44. 1 John 3. 10, 12. <hi>haters of
their brethren, and murderers and liars,</hi> are termed <hi>children of the
Devil, or wicked One,</hi> as well as Idolaters or will-worſhippers.
3. <hi>The children of the wicked One</hi> ſeem to be all ſorts of men, who
are of Satans ſowing. 4. All thoſe who are not <hi>children of the
Kingdome,</hi> but are <hi>to be caſt into a furnace of fire.</hi> Ver. 38. 42.
are termed <hi>tares,</hi> and theſe are not only Idolaters, will-worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
heretiques, but all other ſorts of ſinners, ſuch as are mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9, 10. and elſewhere. Nor are the reaſons valid,
here produced to the contrary. For 1. It followes not thieves
and murderers, and others, whom confeſſedly the authority of the
Magiſtrate here reacheth, are not here meant, therefore not other
tranſgreſſors of the ſecond Table, but Idolaters, will-worſhippers,
heretiques. 2. Nor doth it follow, Chriſt would not have thieves,
murderers, and other tranſgreſſors of the ſecond Table, remain
among the wheat, but to be plucked up; therefore they are not here
meant by the tares, but Idolaters and will-worſhippers, as if Chriſt
would have all tranſgreſſors of the ſecond Table plucked up, none
of the tranſgreſſors of the firſt, which is all one, as to ſay Chriſt
would have all liars, covetous, unrighteous perſons, in any kind
deſtroyed, not any Witch, Atheiſtical ſcoffer, Blaſphemer, Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>later,
profane perſon. 3. It is not proved, that by the <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of the houſholder,</hi> are meant the civil Magiſtrate, why not
the <hi>Angels</hi> termed <hi>reapers? ver.</hi> 39. Theſe Petitioners after
make them the Apoſtles: will they have them to tolerate Idolaters
in the Church? 4. Were it granted, that here were meant on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Idolaters, will-worſhippers, heretiques, how is it proved that
this is a precept to civil Magiſtrates. There is no ſuch precept
in the application or explication of the parable, and therefore it
ſeems to me not to note the duty of the civil Magiſtrate, but the
event of Gods providence, that God would permit the cohabita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the wicked in the world, with the juſt, as is alſo taught in
the parable of <hi>the net, ver.</hi> 47, 48, 49, 50. Not that Magiſtrates
or Miniſters ſhould permit them, and not by civil puniſhment or
Eccleſiaſtical, remove them out of the Church, or the world. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it follows not, Magiſtrates may not deſtroy Idolaters, will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers,
therefore they may not inflict any civil puniſhment,
<hi>from the</hi> ſpecies <hi>to the</hi> genus, <hi>negatively, an argument concludes not.</hi>

               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:119289:19"/>
               <hi>Theſe Petitioners further tell us,</hi> How ſad it is to remember
how in all ages ſince Chriſt, very ſtrange miſtakes have been on this
account; the Lord of life himſelf was put to death for ſuppoſed bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemie
and wickedneſs, and accuſed for being an enemy to <hi>Caeſar,
Mat. 26. 65. John</hi> 19. 12. and this done unto him by a people that
had the Law of God amongſt them, and were famous in the world for
their earthly wiſdom and knowledge. <hi>Stephen</hi> was ſtoned, and
<hi>James</hi> the Apoſtle killed with the ſword, ſuppoſed to be tares, or the
children of the wicked One, when they were the pretious wheat of God,
<hi>Acts 6. 13, 14. and</hi> 12. 2. The Chriſtians that ſuffered in the ten
perſecutions, were they not accuſed of being peſtilent fellows, movers
of ſedition, turners of the world upſide down, enemies to <hi>Caeſar, Acts
24. 5, 12. and</hi> 17. 6, 7. when the contrary was moſt true, and
they will be found to be the faithful martyrs of Jeſus? So in latter
times many of thoſe that have been put to death for hereſie and bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemy,
are by this age acknowledged to be the Saints of God. O
King, that our words might be acceptable to thee, conſider, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thy Self nor Counſellors, have the ſpirit of infallibility; if the
Apoſtles that had an extraordinary ſpirit of diſcerning, muſt not
pluck up the tares, leſt they root up the wheat alſo: how can any
Prince on earth undertake a work ſo dangerous? It is poſsible, many
of thoſe that are counted falſe worſhippers and hereticks, in this day,
may (at the time when God ſhall judge the world in righteouſneſs) be
ſervants of the moſt high God. Remember, we pray thee, that thoſe
that lived in the days of the Lord Jeſus, accuſed their fathers for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
guilty of the blood of the Prophets, ſaying, If we had been in the
days of our Fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in
the blood of the Prophets, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 29, 30. yet themſelves killed
the Lord of life. The Romiſh Church alſo ſaith, if we had lived in
the days of the heathen Emperors, we would not have been partakers
with them in the blood of the Chriſtians, yet puts to death many as
righteous as they were: and now many of thy ſubjects in this Nation,
are ready to ſay, If we had lived in the days of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> we would
not have been guilty with our Fathers in the blood of thoſe good men
that then ſuffered; yet ſuch a ſpirit of perſecution is now riſen up,
as (if not reſtrained) will terminate in the blood of many good men,
and ſo bring down the wrath of God upon this generation, and there will
be no remedy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw</hi> I could eccho out all this after them, were not this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
as a ground of their denial of the taking the Oath of the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:119289:20"/>
Kings Supremacy. It is a good wiſh that the King would deeply
conſider and remember all this; ſome acts of his give cauſe to
think he doth, and to hope he will remember it. I ſaid ſomewhat
to the ſame effect in my <hi>Serious Conſideration of the Oath of the
Kings Supremacy,</hi> and ſuch things as have lately hapned, give ſtill
cauſe to inculcate this, that his Majeſty, his Counſel, and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of juſtice, have need of very much circumſpection how they
impriſon, and other ways puniſh men for their diſſent from that
which is eſtabliſhed in matters of faith and worſhip, ſith this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of puniſhing for ſuppoſed hereſies, errours and ſchiſms, hath
been ſo unhappily and unrighteouſly managed, as gives cauſe to
fear, that it neither was, nor will, nor can be well uſed without
deſtruction of many innocent perſons. God forbid I ſhould juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
any abuſe, or neglect according to my power and place, the
ſeeking of reformation. Nevertheleſs all this amounts not to a
ſufficient ground or reaſon, to deny the Kings Supremacy in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituals,
ſith the like abuſes happen in temporal things, and yet
theſe Petitioners deny not the promiſe, yea and that indeed in
words of ſwearing of obedience in temporal cauſes. We might
make a Catalogue of <hi>Sauls, Davids, Solomons,</hi> and others oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
in temporal things, ſhall we therefore deny their regal pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in them? no, but acknowledge the power, and oppoſe the
abuſe; yet not by arms, or other unpeaceable ways, but by Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to the Rulers, prayers to God, patient ſuffering, which are the
weapons whereby Chriſtians conquer. For which reaſon, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
not againſt that which the Petitioners adde.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4. To inflict temporal puniſhmemts upon any of us thy ſubjects,
for not conforming to thy decrees, that reſtrain us from the worſhip that
we know to be of God; Is it not a breach of that royal law, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
thee, that whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do to you, do you
even ſo to them, for this is the law and the Prophets?</hi> Mat. 7. 12. <hi>And
we would in all humility offer to thy conſideration, if thy ſoul were
in our ſouls ſtead, wouldeſt thou be ſatisfied with the ſame meaſure, as
is now dealt unto us, when neither the God of heaven, nor our own
conſciences condemn us of any evil intended againſt thy perſon or
authority? Nor can the greateſt of our enemies make any due proof
of any combination or plotting with any upon the face of the earth, for
the diſturbance of the publique peace: And this we can with bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
ſay, becauſe we know our own innocency.</hi> Yet cannot this be
a ſufficient ground of denying the Kings Supremacy in ſpirituals;
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:119289:20"/>
nor is the proof of that Supremacy enervated by what follows.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But whereas it is objected, that the Kings of</hi> Iſrael <hi>and</hi> Judah, 
<hi>under the old Teſtament, had power in ſpiritual cauſes, and did pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
blaſphemy and Idolatry, which are crimes of the higheſt nature
againſt God, we confeſs they had ſuch power, which was given to
them in plain precepts, written in the law of</hi> Moſes; <hi>but the Goſpel
that we live under, is another diſpenſation, in which the Lord Jeſus
is the only Law-giver, who doth not (as</hi> Moſes<hi>) proceed againſt the
tranſgreſſors of his precepts, by external force and power, to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying
them in their bodies and eſtates in this life, but in long ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
waits on men, not willing they ſhould periſh, but rather that they
ſhould repent and be ſaved, 2 Theſ. 1. 9. 2 Pet. 3. 9. Acts 17. 31.
and when any continues in diſobedience to the Goſpel, his puniſhment
is eternal in the world to come. The Apoſtle</hi> Paul <hi>testifies of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
that he was a blaſphemer and pereſcuter, 1 Tim. 1. 20. And
if the mind of God had been, that he ſhould have ſuffered death in
that condition, how ſhould he have had repentance given him, and
been ſuch a glorious instrument in the Church as he was? Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
it is too well known, that the Jews are the greateſt blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
againſt our Lord Jeſus Christ, as are on the earth; yet it is
not the mind of the Lord they ſhould be deſtroyed from the face of the
earth, for how then ſhould the Scripture be fulfilled, wherein God
hath promiſed to call them, and to make them the moſt glorious Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the world? Oh how can they be converted, if they be not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
where the Goſpel is preached? We ſpeak not this in favour of
any blaſphemy, for our ſouls abhor it; but becauſe we would have
the lives of men as precious in thy eyes, O King, as they are in the
eyes of the righteous and moſt holy God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true, that I alledged in my <hi>Serious Conſideration of
the Oath of the Kings Supremacy,</hi> the power of the Kings of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
in ſpirituals, to prove the King to be Governor in ſpiritual
cauſes; I did not, nor was it neceſſary I ſhould aſſert the ſame
power every way, or the juſtice of proceeding now by the ſame
Laws, which were in many things appropriate to the policy of
that Nation, nor am I of opinion, that the judicial laws of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
bind us any farther then their common equity, nor do I think
it neceſſary we ſhould fetch our Laws from them, they being in
many things fitted to the policy of that people, which is different
from ours. Nor do I deny, that there is not the ſame reaſon of
puniſhing ſome idolatry and blaſphemy of profeſſed Chriſtians, as
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:119289:21"/>
was of puniſhing the idolatry and blaſphemy of the Iſraelites,
in the worſhipping of the golden Calf, <hi>Baal, Aſhtaroth, Molech,</hi>
there being ſuch ſpecial warnings given them before, ſuch great
things done by God for them, as made their engagement greater,
and their revolt to other gods, worſe, and more deteſtable then in
other people; and if it be true which Dr. <hi>John Burges</hi> in his <hi>rejoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to the reply to Biſhop</hi> Mortons <hi>defence of the three Ceremonies,
that the Popiſh idolatry is not ſo bad as the Iſraelites,</hi> then there
may be cauſe why that idolatry which the Papiſts uſe, ſhould not
be puniſhed with death, though the worſhip of the golden Calf,
<hi>Baal, Molech,</hi> and ſuch Idols were. And for ſome blaſphemies
againſt Chriſt, as the Meſſiah or Son of God, and ſome errours
or hereſies, which under the name of blaſphemies have been puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
with death, and perhaps by Laws in force are liable to the
ſame puniſhments, I dare not ſay that they are equally evil, or to
be puniſhed as the blaſphemy of the mungrel was, <hi>Lev.</hi> 24. 14,
15, 16. Nor do I take upon me to juſtifie thoſe Laws by which
death is awarded to heretiques, nor to avow the ſentences that
have been paſt againſt perſons, as heretiques, becauſe condemned
by Canons of Councils. He that ſhould now enact a law to put
men to death for breaking the Sabbath, becauſe God did ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
it, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15. 35. in the caſe of him that gathered the ſticks
on the Sabbath day; or ſhould make a law, that the father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of a ſtubborn ſon, ſhould bring him to the Elders of the City
to be ſtoned to death, as it is <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 18, 19, 20, 21. ſhould,
as it is ſaid of <hi>Draco</hi> the <hi>Athenian, write his laws in blood.</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
not but that in the New Teſtament, puniſhments are put off to
the laſt judgement, that Chriſt hath told us, <hi>Mark</hi> 3. 28. that <hi>all
ſins ſhall be forgiven to the ſons of men, and blaſphemies wherewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
they ſhall blaſpheme, excepting that against the holy Ghoſt,</hi>
that <hi>John</hi> 8. 7, 8, 9, 10. Chriſt (if that ſtory be genuine) would
not condemn the woman taken in adultery, but rather furthered
her eſcape from ſtoning, that <hi>the Goſpel we live under is another
diſpenſation,</hi> as the Petitioners ſpeak, meaning, that it is not ſo
ſevere and rigid a Covenant, as the Law was, that the <hi>Law was
given by</hi> Moſes, <hi>but grace and truth came by Jeſus Christ,</hi> John 1.
17. And therefore I count them too ſevere beyond Chriſtian mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
that inflict death, impriſonment, baniſhment for ſome
errours termed hereſies, for <hi>non</hi>-conformity to ſome forms of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
for ſome conceived blaſphemies: Some eminent Proteſtants
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:119289:21"/>
have been cenſured as too cruel, even by men of great underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for their ſeverity in theſe things. According to this deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
a prevention may be made of deſtroying ſuch a blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
as <hi>Paul</hi> or the Jews, and yet the Kings Supremacy proved
from the example of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> even in ſpirituals, which
may be exerciſed for publique peace, and common good, if good
caution be uſed, without ſuch direful and cruel perſecutions as
have been. A fathers power may be proved from the Law, <hi>Deut.</hi>
21. 18, 19, 20, 21. though that law ſtand not in force, and ſo
may the Kings power in cauſes Eccleſiaſtical be proved, from the
power of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> though it be denied, that he is to
puniſh Idolatry, blaſphemy, hereſie, as they did, or ſome would
now have it once more ſay the Petitioners;</p>
            <p>5. As it is no wayes lawful from the word of God, for Chriſtian
Magiſtrates to deſtroy and root out the contrary minded in religious
matters, (although Idolaters) ſo ſuch proceedings may many times
prove inconſiſtent with the very being of nations; for ſuppoſe any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
were wholly heatheniſh idolaters, and the word of God coming in
amongſt them, ſhould convert the chief Magiſtrates, and twentieth
part of the Nation more; muſt he with that twentieth part deſtroy

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> All this may be granted. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> practice in
deſtroying the <hi>Americans,</hi> is condemned by <hi>Bartholomew de Caſa,</hi>
a Spaniſh Biſhop, their practiſes in their bloody Inquiſition are
abhorred by all ſober people, that are not made drunk with the
wine of the whore of <hi>Babylons</hi> fornications; few men of good tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and wiſdome, do allow making war to propagate Religion: the
zeal of Princes and Biſhops, in perſecuting Chriſtians, adjudged
heretiques by them, is cenſured as madneſs by well compoſed
men. <hi>In the multitude of people is the Kings honour: but in the
want of people is the deſtruction of the Prince,</hi> Prov. 14. 28. <hi>Thou

and though he be not to deſtroy thoſe that remain infidel-idolaters,
nor to force them to be Chriſtians, yet he may have a power to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern

may be of great advantage to the Church of God, and is not to be

            <p>
               <hi>Afore the firſt ſheet of this</hi> Supplement <hi>was printed off, I met
with a little piece, intituled,</hi> A caution to the ſons of Zion, by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel
Hodgkin, <hi>in which he grants aſſertory oaths in judicial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
not to be forbidden by Chriſt,</hi> Mat. 5. 34. <hi>becauſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
in the law of</hi> Moſes, <hi>and overthrows the Quakers plea,
that no ſwearing is lawful, yet denies any promiſſory oath law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and therefore in that reſpect oppoſeth the oaths of Allegiance
and Supremacy, and ſaith he is impriſoned for that reaſon. In
that book, he firſt excepts againſt the definition</hi> Jeremiah Ives
<hi>gave of a</hi> ſacred oath, that it is a bond by which a man binds his
ſoul to the ſpeaking of that which is in it ſelf true, or the doing of
that which is in it ſelf lawful, unto which the living and true God is
called to witneſs, <hi>Numb. 30. 2. To which</hi> Samuel Hodgkin <hi>faith,</hi>
To this I anſwer, That every ſacred Oath by which God is called to
witneſs to the truth of a thing, or to the performance of a lawful
thing, is a bond whereby the ſoul is bound, but every calling God to
witneſs in lawful things, is not an Oath. As appears thus, if a bare
calling God to witneſs, be ſwearing by God, then calling the heaven
and earth to witneſs, is ſwearing by heaven and earth, for then <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
had ſworn by creatures, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 26. I call heaven and earth to
witneſs againſt you this day; And ſo likewiſe God himſelf, in <hi>Deut.</hi>
30. 19. I call heaven and earth to record against you, <hi>chap.</hi> 31. 28.
But it was ever unlawful to ſwear by creatures, therefore <hi>I</hi> conclude,
that a bare calling to witneſs; is not ſwearing.</p>
            <p>I reply, The concluſion is granted, and yet the definition of
<hi>Jeremiah Ives</hi> ſtands good, who did not ſay, that <hi>a bare calling to
witneſs, is ſwearing,</hi> but <hi>calling God to witneſs to the ſpeaking of
that which is true.</hi> And this to be an oath is granted by <hi>Samuel
Hodgkin</hi> himſelf, <hi>p.</hi> 16. when he ſaith, <hi>That calling God to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is not ſwearing; but when we read of the ſervants of the Lord
ſwearing in Scripture, we find that it was not only a bare calling God
to witneſs, but they ſwear by God, that they did ſpeak the truth, or
that they would do ſuch a thing.</hi> Now ſwearing by God at leaſt
in aſſertory oaths, can be no other then calling God to witneſs of
the truth of that we ſpeak, and in promiſſory of the truth of our
intention to perform what we ſay we will do. That which <hi>Samuel
Hodgkin</hi> ſaith, <hi>Now to ſwear by the Lord, is to ſay that they do
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:119289:22"/>
ſpeak the truth, or will do ſuch a thing by the Lord, as much as if
they ſhould ſay, that the Lord do help them in what they do, or that
they do it by his aſsiſtance: And hence it comes to paſs, that it was
unlawful for a man to ſwear by any creature, becauſe no creature
can help him to ſpeak the truth, or perform what he promiſed; and
hence it is that God took it ill when they did not ſpeak truth, becauſe
they did as much as ſay, that God did help them to ſpeak a lie, and ſo
they blaſphemed the name of God in the higheſt nature; and doubtleſs,
thoſe that made the oath we have in our common Law, did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
no leſs, and therefore they charge the witneſs, By the help of
God to ſpeak the truth,</hi> is a manifeſt miſtake of the meaning of the
phraſe [<hi>to ſwear by the Lord</hi>] which it ſeems he underſtands to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie,
not only that he that ſwears calls God to be a witneſs of the
truth of what he ſaith in aſſertory oaths, and of the truth of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
to perform what he ſaith in promiſſory oaths, but alſo,
that he calls God to witneſs, that he ſpeaks truth by his help, or
God helping him to ſpeak truth in aſſertory oaths, and that his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
is to perform what he promiſeth, by Gods help or aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.
So that according to this mans conceits, it is no ſwearing,
unleſs the perſon ſwearing do call God to be witneſs, not only of
the truth of his words and intentions, but alſo of his acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Gods help in ſpeaking truth in aſſertory oaths, and his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of Gods help to perform what he ſaith he will do in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſory;
which is a new and wild conceit. New, for none, as
far as I know, ever vented it before; but all Writers that I have
met with, have made the calling of God to witneſs the truth of
our ſpeech in aſſertory oaths, and of our intentions to perform,
what we ſay in promiſſory, without this addition of acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that it is by Gods help we ſpeak truth, or of expectation of
help from God to do, what we promiſe, to be ſwearing. And it is
a wild conceit. For 1. It is frivolous to call God to witneſs,
that he ſpeaks truth by his help, or that he expects his help to do
what he promiſeth, it being impertinent to the occaſion and end
of ſwearing; the occaſion of ſwearing being ſome uncertainty of
the truth of his words and intentions, and the end to take away
that, there is no queſtion or controverſie to be decided by whoſe
help he ſpeaks truth, nor by whoſe help he expects to perform
what he promiſeth. Every man knowes, that what is ſpoken or
done, is by Gods help, elſe it could not be; but whether it be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:119289:23"/>
true which he affirms, and his intentions true and real to
perform, the conſideration by whoſe help he ſpeaks, or expects to
do what he promiſeth, is not at all required or minded by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actor
of the oath, as belonging to the oath, but the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he ſpeaks truth by Gods help, is only a duty of thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
which is fitteſt to be done by the perſon ſwearing after the
oath is taken, and the expectation of help from God to perform
what he promiſes, is a duty of truſt in God, or dependance on
him to be done after the ſwearing. 2. If this were neceſſary to
an oath, then he were forſworn or unſworn, that did not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
that he ſpake truth by Gods help, or did not depend
on Gods help for performance of what he promiſed, and all infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels,
hypocrites, Saints that neglect their duty herein, let their
words or intentions be never ſo true, and their performance never
ſo punctual and exact, ſhould be perjured or unſworn. That which
he alledgeth for this conceit, is frivolous. For the <hi>unlawfulneſs
of ſwearing by any creature, is not, becauſe no creature can help him
that ſwears to ſpeak the truth, or perform what he promiſed;</hi> he
that informs him of the truth, may help the ſwearer to ſpeak truth,
though he be a creature, and he that will aid him with money, &amp;c.
may help him to perform what he promiſed; but becauſe God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is a witneſs of ſecret truths, and ſincerity of intentions, and
can only be his judge and avenger if he ſpeak not truth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
more fully oaths are expreſſed in ſuch forms as theſe, God be
my judge, witneſs, helper, &amp;c. Nor is the reaſon, why <hi>God takes
it ill that men ſwear falſly by his name, becauſe it is as much as to
ſay, that God did help them to ſpeak a lie,</hi> for then in promiſſory
oaths when they ſwearby God, he ſhould take it ill if they do not
perform their promiſe, becauſe it is as much as to ſay, that God
helps them to neglect their promiſe; which is a ſenſe no ſwearer
imagins his words bear, nor any reprover of perjury, did ever give
as the reaſon of the iniquity of the breaker of his oath: but becauſe
he by falſe ſwearing ſhews he either believes not, or fears not Gods
diſcovery, or avenging of his deceit. In the form of ſwearing in
our common Law, <hi>So help me God,</hi> the words are not in the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative
Mood, as if it were God doth help me, or will help me,
but <hi>ita me Deus adiuvet</hi> in the Imperative or Potential, let God
help me, may God help me, I pray or wiſh God may help me, or
not according as I ſpeak, truly or otherwiſe, nor is the charge gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:119289:23"/>
by the giver of the oath to the witneſs, by the help of God to
ſpeak truth, but he requires him to ſpeak truth, as he expects help
from God in other things, as his ſalvation, &amp;c. When the ſwearer
ſpeaketh the words, it is his pawning his help he expects from God,
as a voucher that he ſpeaks truth; not an acknowledging he ſpeaks
truth by Gods helping him only in that act of ſpeaking.</p>
            <p>As for what he alledgeth out of <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 26. and 30. 13. and
31. 28. to prove that <hi>all calling to witneſs is not ſwearing,</hi> it is
granted him. I eaſily yield, that men and inanimate things may be
taken to witneſs without ſwearing, as <hi>Gen. 31. 48. Joſh.</hi> 22. 34.
But nevertheleſs calling God to witneſs that we ſpeak truth, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
as we ſpeak is ſwearing: Even as though ſuch rhetorical
ſpeeches as are uſed, <hi>Iſa. 1. 2. Jer.</hi> 22. 29, &amp;c. are not prayers;
or invitations to hear, yet the words of <hi>Solomon, 1 Kin.</hi> 8. 28, 30.
are prayer, ſo though it be not ſwearing which is uſed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 19.
yet it is ſwearing which is uſed, 2 <hi>Cor,</hi> 1. 23.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Another thing which</hi> Samuel Hodgkin <hi>affirms, is,</hi> That all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſory
oaths are forbidden by Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 34. Jam. 5. 12. he
grants aſſertory oaths not forbidden, becauſe they were commanded
in the old Teſtament, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. 11. but denies promiſſory oaths to
be lawful, becauſe they are voluntary, and the occaſion of the precept
was about voluntary oaths, <hi>ver.</hi> 33. and therefore they are wholly
forbidden, but not aſſertory. Whence he infers, that the Oaths of
Allegiance and Supremacy, ſo far as they are promiſſory are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden.</p>
            <p>Concerning this opinion, I deny not, but that there are learned
men that conceive, that promiſſory oaths of ſecular matters, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
of ſmall moment, are forbidden, becauſe of the occaſion,
<hi>ver.</hi> 33. of the prohibition, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 34. But if promiſſory oaths
be forbidden univerſally, then the promiſſory oaths to the Lord are
forbidden, and not only oaths of ſecular matters between man and
man. And if all promiſſory oaths be forbidden, the ſwearing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to our common Law, not excepted againſt by <hi>S. H.</hi> ſhould
be unlawful. For thus uſually is the witneſs ſworn, <hi>You ſhall
make true anſwer to ſuch queſtions as ſhall be demanded of you: You
ſhall ſpeak the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth.</hi> The Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thus, <hi>You ſhall well and truly trie, and true deliverance make;</hi>
All which are requiring of a promiſe; and ſo exacting a promiſſory
oath. But that promiſſory oaths are not univerſally forbidden, I
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:119289:24"/>
prove, 1. From 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 27. where the Apoſtle urgeth the
<hi>Theſſalonians</hi> thus, I <hi>adjure you by the Lord, that this Epiſtle be
read to all the holy brethren.</hi> That this paſſage contains urging by
oath, hath been proved before in my <hi>Serious Conſideration of the
Oath of the Kings Supremacy,</hi> and in this <hi>Supplement</hi> in my Reply
to <hi>Richard Hubberthorn</hi> and <hi>Samuel Fiſher.</hi> But this oath which
he urgeth on them, was promiſſory, it being of a thing to be done
by them, to wit, <hi>the reading of that Epiſtle to all the holy brethren.</hi>
Whence I argue, That ſort of oath by which <hi>Paul</hi> adjured, bound,
or urged the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> was lawful, elſe the Apoſtle would not
have urged it, or them by it. But <hi>Paul</hi> adjured, bound by, or ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> by a promiſſory oath, therefore a promiſſory
oath is lawful in the new Teſtament.</p>
            <p>That which <hi>Samuel Hodgkin</hi> ſaith, That <hi>the Text ſpeaks not a
word of ſwearing,</hi> is not true, the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> ſignifies I <hi>adjure,</hi> or
<hi>urge you by oath,</hi> it is the ſame word that is uſed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 63.
which <hi>Samuel Hodgkin</hi> himſelf, <hi>p.</hi> 5. denies not to have been <hi>a
charging Chriſt to ſwear by the living God,</hi> ſaving that <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 63.
it is the compound Verb, but 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 27. the ſimple.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But ſaith</hi> Samuel Hodgkin, were it not more reaſonable to think,
that if the Theſſalonians did value <hi>Pauls</hi> charge, they would as ſoon
have read this Epiſtle without ſwearing, as to be ſworn to read it?
for doubtleſs, if they had not valued his charging them to read it, they
would not have valued his charging them to ſwear to read it.</p>
            <p>I reply, Whether the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> did value <hi>Pauls</hi> charge or
no, cannot be determined by us, but this we know, that adjuring
or urging by oath, being a ſtricter bond, then urging to promiſe,
or requiring without an oath, it may well be conceived, that the
Apoſtle had reaſon to charge them by oath, and not barely to charge
them without it.</p>
            <p>2. I urge that paſſage, <hi>Heb. 6. 16. An oath for confirmation, is
to men an end of all ſtrife,</hi> of which <hi>Samuel Hodgkin, p.</hi> 8. grants,
<hi>that it contains the end of oaths commanded,</hi> and ſo cannot in reaſon
deny, that thoſe oaths which are there meant, having the end of
ſwearing are lawful. But that paſſage ſpeaks of the end of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſory
oaths, (for ſuch was Gods oath, of which the Apoſtle there
ſpeaks, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. 15, 17.) and therefore they have the end of ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to take away ſtrife or contradiction, or doubt concerning mens
intentions and purpoſes one to another, and ſo are for a neceſſary
uſe, and conſequently, lawful.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:119289:24"/>
3. The Angels ſwearing, <hi>Rev. 10. 6. that there ſhould be time
no longer,</hi> was of a thing future, and therefore to be reduced to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſory
oaths, if the diviſion of oaths into aſſertory and promiſſory
be full, it cannot be reduced to aſſertory oaths, therefore it muſt
be reduced to promiſſory, and therefore promiſſory oaths are not
wholly forbidden.</p>
            <p>4. That which the Pſalmiſt makes a property of one that was
to dwell in Gods holy hill, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15. was moral, and ſo not unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
as abrogated in the new Teſtament, but when he ſaith, a perſon
making a promiſſory oath is not to change, that is, not to neglect to
keep it, <hi>though it be to his own hurt,</hi> he allows a promiſſory oath,
as in ſome caſes lawful.</p>
            <p>5. Add hereto, that a promiſſory oath if unlawful, is ſo, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
becauſe it is ſwearing, and then all ſwearing ſhould be unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
contrary to the grant concerning aſſertory oaths, by <hi>Samuel
Hodgkin,</hi> if as promiſſory, then all promiſes ſhould be unlawful,
and ſo all civil contracts unlawful, marriage, covenants, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>6. If no promiſſory oaths be lawful to a Chriſtian, then a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Prince may not confirm a league with another Prince or
State, nor any Magiſtrates, Officers of Juſtice, take promiſſory
oaths, no Souldiers, no Truſtees, Secretaries, &amp;c. are to make
promiſſory oaths of faithfulneſs, which would expoſe all affairs of
government and truſt, to ſuch hazard and uncertainty, as would
take away, as things and men are, much of that ſecurity men have
in their affairs, and haſten the ruine of States.</p>
            <p>That which <hi>Samuel Hodgkin</hi> ſaith, that <hi>there is no command for
promiſsory oaths,</hi> is ſaid without proof. For the precepts, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.
13. <hi>Deut. 10. 20. Jer.</hi> 4. 2. do include promiſſory oaths, as well
as aſſertory. As there is no difference made in the Text, ſo there is
as much if not more likelihood, that promiſſory oaths ſhould be
chiefly meant, becauſe the oaths of which we have examples in the
old Teſtament, are moſt of them promiſſory.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 33. ſpeaks of promiſſory oaths, but that the
prohibition, <hi>ver.</hi> 34. is limited to promiſſory, as forbidding
them only, and not aſſertory, or forbidding promiſſory oaths uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally,
ſo as to allow none of that ſort, is ſaid without proof, and
there is this in the text to ſhew, that it is meant not of thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſory
oaths, which are meant, <hi>ver.</hi> 33. to wit, ſpecial vows to
God; but of other oaths, whether promiſſory or aſſertory, which
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:119289:25"/>
are in our ordinary ſpeech, 1. That the forms of oaths, <hi>by the
heaven, by the earth, by Jeruſalem, by the head,</hi> there expreſſed,
are not uſed in ſpecial vowes, but in common ſpeech of one man
with another, and moſt likely in cuſtomary, light, needleſs, paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate
ſwearing. 2. The expreſſion [<hi>let your communication or
ſpeech</hi>] notes their conference one with another. 3. And ſo do
the terms, <hi>yea and nay,</hi> which are uſed moſt fitly in colloquies or
ſpeeches, wherein one anſwers another.</p>
