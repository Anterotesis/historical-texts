            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <head>A true and plain Account of the Discoveries made in <hi>Scotland,</hi> of the late Conspiracies against His Majesty, and the Government.</head>
                  <p>THE King's <hi>Majestie</hi> having, on certain great considerations, indicted a Parliament, to hold at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> 28 of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1681. Did render that Meeting the more illustrious, by nominating His Royal Brother Commissioner, to represent His <hi>Majesty</hi> in it.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Fanatical Party,</hi> who let no occasion slip, to promove their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs, and to disturb the settled Government, did at this time, use all their endeavours, to have as many of those infected with their principles, elected Commissioners for the Parliament, as the little power and Interest they had in the Nation could procure, and even where they could not hope to succeed, they had the insolence to attempt, thereby pursuing clos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what they constantly design, that is, pertinaciously to disturb, where they cannot alter, and to found a Reputation to their Party, by much noise, though to little purpose.</p>
                  <p>At the time of meeting of the Parliament, their first consult was to strick at the Head, and by invading the Right of the Monarchy, to pull it down so far, as to have the King, in the Person of His Commissioner, subjected to the same Rules and Inquisitions, with other subordinat Members. The King by His Laws, having prescribed Rules to those who Serve Him in that Great Court, and Council: They, according to the Laws of their Leagues and Covenants, propose that the Parliament should prescribe the same to the King, consonant enough to their beloved Design of Co ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in Power. Had this succeeded, they with this one Blow, had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown the Parliament, by laying the Commissioner aside: But as men oft-times design bold Treasons with abundance of Resolution, yet are frighted from the Execution, by the danger, as well as ugliness of the Crime, So this insolent Resolution dar'd not shew its Face, being strangl'd by their own Fears. And seeing they could not dissolve the Parliament, they, in the next place, resolv'd to disappoint the Design of it; and indeed, if the maintaining of an unjust Interest could warrand the action, they had reason so to do: For the <hi>Fanatical-Party</hi> having, by their own great industry, and the supine negligent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> (to say no worse) of these Trusted by the King, to suppress them, not only kept up, but encreased their pernicious Brood; So that they began to appear formidable, both to the King and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: and one of their great Hopes, whereby their Party increased, being founded on the short continuance of the Supply granted by the Nation, for maintaining the Forces, they could little doubt, but that all Loyal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects would not only continue, but also further augment them, rather then leave the Seditious, in a capacity to disturb the Government. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as a necessary expedient to preserve <hi>Fanaticism,</hi> they resolved by all possible means, to hinder any continuation of the Supplie. But they soon found, that the Votes of their Party had neither number nor weight.</p>
                  <p>These well-natur'd Subjects, finding that they could not disappoint, thought it convenient to perplex; and since they could not do what they would, they resolv'd to do all they could. And albeit the late Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi> and some others, who were under too great obligations to the King's <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,</hi> and <hi>His Royal-Highness,</hi> to appear on the side of their Friends in the good old Cause; whilst the opposition was so bare-fac'd, and the hope of success so little. Yet lest their little Flock should be discouraged, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55475:3"/>
then to animat them the more close, and (as they thought) undiscern'd methods. And now the Cause being in an apparent decay, they labour'd to refresh it, with its first milk, the Pretence of Religion.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore a new Security for Religion was proposed; And albeit our Laws had formerly provided, what was necessary for this; yet it could not be expected that those, who aimed at debate for Religion, should rest-sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with what settled it. So the Doctrine of the Church, the Canons of Councils, and the Laws of the Kingdom being all lookt upon as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: <hi>Argyle,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Cochran, Salton,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Tarras, Philiphaugh, Stairs, Gallowsheils,</hi> and others of that Crew, would needs provide a greater security than these afforded; and indeed it was congruous for those who were tainted with new Doctrines, to desire new Sanctions: For this end they pressed a Committee, for drawing an Act to secure the Protestant Religion, which was no sooner proposed then granted; accordingly a Committee was appointed, consisting for the most part of West-countrey men, who upon short deliberation prepared a long Act, which at its first appearance in the Articles, was soon discerned to be an Invasion upon the Prerogative, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of a Defence for Religion, and not to have many more Lines than Incroatchments upon the Royal Right: whereupon it was rejected; and in place of it a general and plain Ratification of all the former good Laws, which had past for security of the Protestant Religion, was drawn, approven, and acquiesced in, by the Parliament. But Fanaticks are not of a temper to give over, for notwithstanding of this good Law, Murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were heard, Clamors were raised, and open Protestations were made for f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rther security in Religion. Wherefore a new Committee was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, for preparing an Act to be drawn from the proposals for that end. The Party which clamored for the Protestant Religion (but in effect intending good Offices to the Fanatical party) did seek after what conduc'd to their by-ends, which as they were easily discovered, were as soon rejected: <hi>Argyle,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Cochran,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Tarras, Stairs, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liphaugh, Gallowshiels,</hi> and their adherents fall at last on an expedient, as they thought insuperable by the Kings Servants, and which would force them on the Dilemma of opposing Religion, or the Soveraignity.</p>
                  <p>In the first Year and Parliament of King <hi>Iames</hi> the sixth, when the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences betwixt Queen <hi>Mary</hi> and many of the Nobility were in their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est hight, and she forc'd to resign her Government, being a Prisoner; there were several Acts past in that, and some subsequent Parliaments, which incroached on the Prerogatives of the Crown, the King being then an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant; and amongst others, that wherein the <hi>Confession of Faith</hi> was insert, had in it several Clauses altogether extrinsick to a <hi>Confession of Faith,</hi> for which that Act by its Title was chiefly design'd: And tho these Acts and Clauses which derogated from the Rights of the Crown, were often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scinded, or corrected, and the Prerogative fully vindicated in many suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Parliaments: yet these who intended more disturbance to the State, nor security for Religion, took occasion after their other Proposals were rejected, to offer the renewing of the said Act of the first Parliament of King <hi>Iames</hi> the sixth, as an expedient for securing the Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as it is there profess'd; concluding, that if that Act were renewed, it would derogate from the pesterior Laws, which corrected what related to the Prerogative; or if the renewing of it were refus'd, they might take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion from that refusal, to impose on the People, that the Kings Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioner and the Parliament design'd not the security of the Protestant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But the Parliament defeated both these Projects, by taking into the Test not that Act, but the Protestant Religion contained in it; for the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament was far from reviving, much less for inserting in the Test any part of that Act, which did incroach on the Royal Prerogative, the Episcopal Government, and Policy, or whatever was extrinsick, or contradictory to the Protestant Religion contained in it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:55475:3"/>This, as all other disappointments, incited rage in those who resolved not to be satisfied; and those pretended Patrons of the Protestant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, will overturn it, and tear the securest Test that could be made for it, rather then permit, that Monarchy and it should stand together; and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that this Test, as it did absolutely secure the Protestant Religion, so in just consequence thereof, it knocked <hi>Fanaticism</hi> on the head: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to work they fall against it, with all the force of their imaginations; and none appeared more violent then those who formally with undiscreet violence had press'd it, whilst they hop'd to invenom it, with a mixture of the poison of the Covenant. But 'mongst them all, none acted with more industry, or more malice, then the late Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi> who being by Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Choice sufficiently <hi>Fanatical,</hi> yet having dissembled it for a while, thereby to keep himself in the Government, and to draw it to a concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in his particular designs, and oppressions, whereby he kept a great Estate, defrauding all Creditors, and bringing many Families to beggary; he found this Parliament pry a little into these Mysteries, for they having made some motion in doing right to the Earls of <hi>Errol, Marischal</hi> and <hi>Strathmore,</hi> whose Estates were exposed for <hi>Argiles</hi> Debt, whilst he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd his own Estate, without owning a relief to them: Therefore, albeit in the beginning of the Parliament, he professed a fervour for carrying on of the King's Service, yet (his zeal to the Old Cause, being prick'd on by this Invasion of his new Right) in the course of it, none was so active, or used more indirect ways to disappoint it.</p>
                  <p>But being over-power'd by the Loyal Members, who were Ten to One of the dis-affected; albeit he, and other Sticklers, were allowed to word the Test at their pleasure, and did accordingly add to it all those Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses which since hath given pretences of scruple to many who have refused it; yet no sooner was the Session of Parliament adjourned; but the said late <hi>Argile</hi> industriously, first at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and afterward in traversing several Shires, did insinuate all the prejudices he could devise against the Tenor of the Test: Thereby endeavouring (and not without some success) to increase the dissatisfied Party, and fit the Nation the more for Cumbusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: So passing home to the Shires of <hi>Argile,</hi> and <hi>Tarhet,</hi> he fix'd the Clergy and Laity thereof in these seditious Sentiments. Thereafter he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> giving it out openly, that he would not take the Test; but to make his refusal the more malicious, proposes to his Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and those of the Government, that he might be allowed to take it with his own Explanation, which Exposition he put in Writ, and disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it; being of that Tenor and Contryvance, as to cast all the Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons therein loose, making his Fancy the rule of his Religion, and his own Loyalty the standard of his Allegeance, according to which he was only to ty himself.</p>
                  <p>His <hi>Majesties</hi> Commissioner, and the Council, being well informed of his seditious Carriage, both in City, and Countrey, and fully confirmed in their Judgments, of his malicious Design in this his Paraphrase on the Test; and finding that thereby he had not only perverted the Sense of his <hi>Majesties</hi> Laws, contrary to their true Meaning and Intention; but that he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to shake the People loose from their Allegeance, and make all Obligations thereto illusory: and that by these Methods, he did with bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and impudence, found a Schism in the Church, and Faction in the State, publickly owning them in the face of Council: On which grounds he was most justly pursued by the Kings Advocat, before the Soveraign Justice Court, and there by Learn'd Judges, and a Jury, not only of his Peers, but many of them his nearest Relations; his Accusation was found relevant and proven, and judged a sufficient ground to infer the Pains appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Law for Treason.</p>
                  <p>Albeit his Father had been one of the most obstinate, and most perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious

Rebels against the Royal Family, and that he himself had been educated in these Principles, and had entered early into those Practices: and albeit it be notourly known, that his private Discontents and Debates against his Father, and the penury to which those had reduced him, were the Motives which made him joyn with <hi>Middleton</hi> in the Hills, bringing no Power with him to that Army, and acting as little in it; but by assuming the Honour of what was acted by <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>naughton</hi>: and that at last he was instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to break that Party by Faction; which though this was clearly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned by <hi>Middleton</hi> at the time, yet he judged fit to dissemble it, both for encouraging the <hi>High-landers,</hi> and giving reputation to His <hi>Majesties</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, upon which account also at <hi>Argiles,</hi> then Lord <hi>Lorn</hi>'s earnest suit he did give Testificates to him of his own wording, which those of undoubted Loyalty did not require, and indeed were only useful to such whose Actions and Principles needed vindication; yet under pretence of these, together with the great Assistance of the Duke of <hi>Lauderdail,</hi> having attained to so immense Donatives from His <hi>Majesty</hi> both in Estate and Dignity, it was not easie to believe, he should retain that hereditary Malignity, at least to such a degree as to become an open Rebel; <hi>but the</hi> Ethiopian <hi>cannot change his Skin</hi>; for albeit the Kings <hi>Majesty,</hi> and his <hi>Royal Highness</hi> were so far from any resolution of taking his life, that he was allowed all free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in Prison, even after he was found Guilty; and that no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prejudice was design'd to him, than to take from him those Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions and Superiorities, which he and his Predecessors had surreptitious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquired; and were used by him and them to destroy many honest and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Familes, sometimes by stretches of Law, and at other times by Violence and Force, but always under shelter and pretence of these Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions: And that some reparation might have been made to his just Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, and some Donatives to those, whom he and his Father had formerly rob'd and destroy'd, for their Fidelity and Loyalty to their King: And the <hi>Super-plus</hi> (if any were) was intended for his Lady and Children; which was the hight of Clemency, there being indeed more Debt upon the Estate then the whole of its value: Yet being more conscious of his own Guilt then his Prince did apprehend, he dar'd not rely upon that Clemency, whereof he had tasted so plentifully; but abusing the favour of his open Imprisonment, for verifying of his other Crimes, he added this one, of breaking the Prison, and flying from the Laws.</p>
                  <p>No King but ours could after all this think of favouring his Family, but His <hi>Majesty</hi> will not only favour but restore, and before it was known that the late <hi>Argile</hi> had more Debt then Estate, in a Royal <hi>Largese,</hi> He gifts more to his Children by thrice then their Father could lawfully give them, had he never been Forsault.</p>
                  <p>Could it have been thought that any Christian, or Gentleman, could have been guilty of Ungratitude to so benign and bountiful a Prince; and yet that the late Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi> did after the receiving so many Favours, and the profession and boasting of so much Loyalty; not only enter in a horrid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy for rising in Arms, but gave at least courage by his bold Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings to those who conspir'd the murther of His Sacred <hi>Majesty,</hi> and his <hi>Royal Highness</hi>; and this Conspiracy does demonstrate what was his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that Paraphrase upon the Test, which Fools and Knaves have justified as very Loyal and Orthodox.</p>
                  <p>But with what forwardness <hi>Argile</hi> and others did enter into a Conspiracy for overturning the Monarchical Government, destroying the sacred Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the King, and of his only Brother, and for pulling Ruine upon the three Kingdoms by a Civil War, the evident Proofs of unsuspect Witnesses, and the concurrence of many authentick Papers and Documents with these Depositions, will not only sufficiently prove, but amount to the quality of a Demonstration, all the pieces being considered together; and with what
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55475:4"/>
earnestness he acted, doth evidently appear from these following Evidences.</p>
                  <p>For shortly after <hi>Argiles</hi> escape, information was given from the West that he had caused secure the Militia Arms of <hi>Argile</hi> and <hi>Tarbet</hi> Shires, as also a considerable quantity of the Kings Arms were given to him in Trust, besides a little Magazine which he had of his own, and some pieces of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, and that he had employed some Merchants to bring Arms from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad to be landed securely in some of his remote High-land Castles.</p>
                  <p>And upon inquiry, one <hi>William Campbel</hi> Master of a Ship at <hi>Newport-Glasgow</hi> was found to be conduc'd for this end, as his Deposition taken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore some of the Officers of State doth clearly evince.</p>

is meaned the suddain muster of the Rebels; In the close of the Letter which says, <hi>Things are full as high as I tell you,</hi> is meaned that the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion was instantly to break out; And having met with <hi>Iohn Nisbet</hi> after his coming from <hi>Holland,</hi> the said <hi>Nisbet</hi> explained to him, that the Sense of the said Letter was, as is above-said.</p>

                        <p>In my last, or it precedent to it, I shewed you that <hi>Trading</hi> was very low here, and many breaking, which has made the Merchants (such as they are) to think that <hi>desperate Diseases must have desperate Cures</hi>; and while they have some Stock, it will be better to venture out, than to keep Shop and sit still till all be gone, and then they shall not be able to act, but let all go: Which resolution I thought a thing not to confide in, seing the most of them are <hi>Fire-side Merchants,</hi> and loves not to venture where storms are any thing apparent.

Friends, I mean Merchants, wrote to me, that after I had spoken to you, possibly you might come this way, the better, thereby to advise them what to do in this case, for I have signified somewhat of it to them, but not so far as this, because I thought to have seen you long ere this time: But I hope you will not misconstruct of my staying, seing in it I designed nothing but advancement of <hi>our Trade</hi>; but once this Week these Factors sent for will be here, and then matters will <hi>in instanti,</hi> either off or on, break, or go thorow.

                              <p>That Mr. <hi>Baillie</hi> of <hi>Ierviswood</hi> told him frequently, what Steps were made in this, and that the Lord <hi>Russel,</hi> &amp;c. had agreed to raise 5000. pound, and that they expected the other 5000. pound to be raised in the City, which failing, the <hi>Scots-men</hi> were to go beyond Sea, and that <hi>Baillie</hi> told him, he had advised the Earl of <hi>Argile</hi> to accept of this 10000.

                  <p>All these Depositions were taken in <hi>England,</hi> except <hi>Earlstons</hi> and <hi>Campbels.</hi> After this, one Mr. <hi>Spence,</hi> who past under the name of <hi>But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,</hi> being apprehended there, was sent to <hi>Scotland.</hi> Major <hi>Holms</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that <hi>Spence</hi> did pass under the name of <hi>Butler,</hi> that he came over from <hi>Holland</hi> with a Cargo of <hi>Argiles</hi> Books, to disperse them, that he landed at <hi>Harwich,</hi> that he could open <hi>Argiles</hi> Letters, and was the person who directed many of <hi>Argiles</hi> Letters to him.</p>
                  <p>These Proofs, with what occurr'd in <hi>England,</hi> were sufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince all men of the Truth of this Conspiracy; but the perversness of <hi>Fanatick</hi> humors will neither admit of Confession nor Amendment: For albeit the Evidence did fully convince Juries and Judges: albeit Parties confess Associations and Resolutions to amend the Government in their own Methods: albeit some acknowledge designs to surprize the Kings Guards, others to have a Parliament called (whether the King will or will not) to judge of the Government; and severals with great remorse reveal their own resolutions to murder the Sacred Person of the King, and his Royal Brother, and they adhering to this Confession; yet <hi>Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> will neither believe it, nor allow others to do so, but with unheard of Impudence treat so weighty a matter in Ridicule, as if they who before had acted all, which now could be feared should be now esteem'd inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to fall in the like Actions, albeit they openly avow the same Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples: and bold Pamphleters adventure to impose these clear Proofs as apert Falshoods upon the credulous World, and too many were so ill minded as to believe them. But it's hoped, that what follows will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince all good Men of the truth of what was discovered, and silence all Libellers, if Darkness must give place to Light.</p>
                  <p>AT the time of the Discovery of the Conspiracy in <hi>England,</hi> several Letters, with two Keys for opening some mystical Words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in them, were found with Major <hi>Holms</hi> and others, which Letters were known to be <hi>Argiles</hi> Hand-writ, by those who were acquainted with it, and afterwards being confess'd by the said <hi>Holms</hi> to be so; they were considered in <hi>England,</hi> and some imperfect Decyphers made of some of them there: many of which Letters, with the Keys, and these Decyphers were sent down to <hi>Scotland</hi>; but they appeared so perplex'd, what with Cyphers, what with other secret Contrivances in Writing, as that some who then had the chief management of Affairs there, by their supine negligence made but little procedure in discovering them: Until a Secret Committee was appointed by His <hi>Majesty,</hi> who considering that those Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters might contain Matters of importance; did apply themselves with earnestness to search into them; but finding them very intricate, and that the Decyphers which were sent from <hi>England</hi> did open nothing to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: They employed one Mr. <hi>Gray</hi> of <hi>Crichie,</hi> and gave him for the first Experiment, that Letter written by the Lady of <hi>Argile</hi> to her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, thereupon to make an Essay, which indeed proved more uneasie to unfold, then any of the rest; yet with much travel, he did very ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously discover, First, that every Cypher was made up of two Figures, Next, That every Letter of the Alphabet was denoted by three different Cyphers, which were promiscuously used in one and the same Word; As
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55475:7"/>
likewise that there was Mute-figures mix'd in with many Words, the more to confound the Discoverer: so that upon application of the triple Alphabet, hereafter set down, to this and several others of the Letters; it was found to open them exactly.</p>
                  <p>Of which first Discovery Mr. <hi>Gray</hi> having given an account to the Lords of the Secret Committee, they found it evident, and appointed the rest of the Letters, the <hi>English</hi> Keys, and all other Papers relating to that Business to be given him for his help in further Discoveries; all which being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, it was observed, that the middle Alphabet of that triple one found out in <hi>Scotland,</hi> was the same with that found out in <hi>England,</hi> which was made use of by <hi>Argile</hi> himself in his Letters; yet his way of using it in his Writings was so perplex'd by the interposition of a great many Mute-figures, that tho the Key was found out there, yet some of the Letters could not be opened: And in full evidence of this first Discovery, the said Letter is afterward set down, both as it was written in the Cypher, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so as it was Decyphered, to which is added the triple Alphabet, the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand thereof.</p>

It's a horrid way for any that bears the name of Christians to associat persons to Murder on the High-ways: There is an Story going here that there was a Ship put in to <hi>Newcastle</hi> which had some Box from Rebellious people in <hi>Holland,</hi> and when they came to Land, a Waiter came to search the Ship, and the Box was cast into the Sea, at which the Waiter called the Ship-Master to catch the Box as he would be answerable; so it's said, it was got and sent to the King, and that <hi>Io.

                        <p>I Came here on <hi>Tuesday,</hi> where I found a great Meeting, E. <hi>Perth,</hi> M. <hi>Mon.</hi> E. <hi>Marr. Gen. Dr.</hi> and the Advocat, four Lords of the Session; all the Lords came here to see W. F. and Q. and R. came with W. D. came by an order with all <hi>Fife</hi> Heretors and D's Troop. I never saw F. so vexed for D. countrey (here is in plain writing some Scots News till it came to this) I got not Write the last week, because poor <hi>Archie C.</hi> is sick; and I will not trust my Letters to every one, I have got nothing done in my affairs, our Trade goes ill on; but God I hope will help me to bear all. I am sory I can do nothing for W. I am this far on my way to <hi>Inveran</hi> and to see my dear H. I shall give L. account when I come back: and I fear till then I will not get Write, for my boy is sick. I sent the Letter to L. Mat. who I saw on <hi>Wednesday,</hi> D. told me he had received yours, but did not yet Read it, which I confess I thought a little strange, being at least eight
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55475:8"/>
dayes with him, I invited D. here to stay with W<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but D. would not, but said I knew it was not meet, fit, nor safe for D. to ly at this House; I said I thought none would be so ill, as to take that ill; D. came not, I said F. never stood to shew his constant kindness to W. and all that belonged to D. L. Matl. is very busie here doing what D. I hope hath no pleasure in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I hear for all D. does there is a warrant to L. <hi>Castlehill</hi> to get D. place; but L. M. knows not yet. There was never such work as has been here, it makes all in fear, some summoned for speaking with Intercommuned people the stile of their Horn. Eight years ago: F. hath so stickled for them all, that it hath procured him a great deal of love from the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and somewhat else from others, its the strangest thing, tho it could not be proven they could not get an absolvitor, they take the Test, and pay a great deal to <hi>Tam Gordon</hi> the Clerk, who gets too great a deal of Money, there was one here a Feuar of W. that lives in <hi>Salen</hi> that was most unjustly summoned here by one <hi>Paton</hi> for speaking Treason, I spoke to L. M. for D. but none befriended D. or appeared for D. but. F. who did bring D. off. The Treason was only good of W. The other tho the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorit of the Clerk was found a liar, and <hi>Iames Oliphant</hi> absolved, O but I could write a long Letter to W. who I think happy be others.</p>

                  <p>This Letter is Decyphered by the aforesaid Alphabetical Key, and by the Countess of <hi>Argiles</hi> Deposition, the Letter <hi>L,</hi> stands for <hi>Lorn,</hi> and the Letters <hi>L, M,</hi> for Lord <hi>Maitland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>MR. <hi>Gray</hi> of <hi>Crichie</hi> having considered these following Letters of <hi>Argiles,</hi> which after discovery, were found to comprehend the Designs more plainly, and finding such a perplex'd contexture and in-cohesion of the Words, as he had not observed, at any time before, in this way of Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: He concluded it to be a work of very great difficulty to open them; yet his success in former Discoveries, gave him encouragement to make an attempt. But in the mean time, having informed the Lords of the Secret Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, that it appeared from the Postscript of the long Letter (where <hi>Argile</hi> says, in plain Writing, that Mr. <hi>Butler</hi> (which is <hi>Spence</hi>) knows how to write to me, and understands my address, and to instruct you; and if not, he had lost six hours work) that the said Mr. <hi>Spence</hi> could do the business: And they finding, that what was already Decyphered, did give such evidence of a Conspiracy and Treasonable Designs against the King, and His Government, which being joyn'd with <hi>Earlstons</hi> Deposition, and the Letter taken upon him from <hi>Io. N.</hi> they judged themselves bound in Duty, to offer what was discovered to the consideration of his <hi>Majesties</hi> most Honourable Privy Council in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and thereupon, according to the Law and Practice of the Nation, did call before them the said <hi>Spence,</hi> and after all Arguments of perswasion and command were used, and these Passages in <hi>Argiles</hi> Letter, whereby it appeared he was instructed to open them, were represented unto him; yet (notwithstanding of his Duty and Alledgeance to his Prince, and that it was judicially declared, that what he Deposed, should not militate against him) he still refusing to open the Letters, or to depon that he could not; yea, not so much as to answer other Interrogators, which did arise from matter of Fact clearly proved against him. They afterwards proceeded to Torture, according to the custom of Nations, in the like Cases, which had its desired effect. For upon the day of <hi>August</hi> 1684, he not only acknowledged that he was the Mr. <hi>Butler,</hi> or <hi>M. B.</hi> mentioned in <hi>Argiles</hi> Letters; but also un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to shew the way of reading the following Letters, to the then Thesau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer Deput, now Lord Secretary, and to the Lord Register, upon their
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:55475:11"/>
promise not to divulge the same (which accordingly they performed) and so he gave in a Copy of the Letters opened. But Mr. <hi>Gray</hi> (after some pains taken) understanding from the Lord Register that all the Words of the Letters were significant Words, whereof he had formerly been doubtful; there being of 1024 Words in the long Letter, 800 Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syllab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, he did fall upon the way of opening these Letters, which not only did confirm the Sense Mr. <hi>Spence,</hi> had given of them; but made it a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration: so that by the way of Opening afterwards set down, the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was more clearly proved, then it could have been done by the attesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of many Witnesses: By which was discovered both the blackness of the Treason, and the great care taken for keeping it secret.</p>
                  <p>For, 1. Things were express'd under new words: so that indeed upon the matter it is a New Language. 2. These Words were written in Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers. 3. This Cypher consisted of a Triple Alphabet. 4. Many Words were intermix'd with Mute-Cyphers. 5. In some of these Letters all the Relatives were express'd by Figures, as in the Lady <hi>Argiles</hi> Letter, the Figure 43, or the Letter D, stands for the Relatives <hi>He,</hi> His, Him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 6. That tho Mr. <hi>Spence</hi> was instructed to shew the way of reading the following Letters, yet he knew nothing of the purpose contain'd in them, all the material Words being in Cypher. 7. The words in the long Letter were so ordered, that 254 Words in course were interposed betwixt the 1 and 2 Word in Sense, and as many betwixt the 3 and 4, and so forth to the last Word of the Letter: then beginning with the 2 Word there was 252 Words betwixt that and the next in Sense, and so forth till they came to the <hi>penult</hi> Word: again beginning with the 3 Word of the Letter, betwixt which and the next in Sense: there interveen'd only 250 Words, and so forward to the end. 8. In the short Letter 62 Words were interposed betwixt the first and second, and so to proceed as in the other. By which unequal destribution and gradual decresce of the interjected Words, the method of reading became the more mysterious and intricate; But the way fallen upon by Mr. <hi>Gray</hi> giving so clear and convincing evidence of the Method, it leaves no ground of doubt concerning the Matter: For in the long Letter there being 8 Colums, and each Column containing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>28 Words, <hi>Argiles</hi> way of using them is, he begins at the head of the first Column, and proceeds to the foot of it, then beginning at the bottom of the second Column, he rises to the head thereof, thereafter begins at the top of the 3 Column, and goes on after that manner till he come to the upmost Word of the 8 Column, which tho it be last Word in order, yet it is but the 8 Word in Sense: Whereby all the Words were plac'd in their right Sense and plain view, as the Letter both in its Mask and Decypher doth clearly evince; yet one Word being added or abstracted in the said order of the Words, the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter should return to its first <hi>Chaos</hi> of Nonsense. The Letters follow, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with their Decyphers, and ways of opening.</p>

I did truly in my Proposition mention the very least Sum, I thought could do our Business effectually, not half of what I would have thought requisite in an other juncture of Affairs; and what I proposed I thought altogether so far within the power of those concerned, that if a little less could possibly do the Business, it would not be stood upon: I reckoned the assistance of the Horse absolutly necessar for the first Brush, and I do so still: I shall not be peremptor to urge the precise number named, but I do think there needs very near that number effectually; and I think 1000 as easie had as 8 or 600 and it were hard that it stuck at the odds. I leave it to you to consider if all should be hazarded, upon so small a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer. As to the Money, I confess what was proposed, is more by half then is absolutely necessar at the first Weeks work, but soon after all the Sum was proposed, and more will be necessar, if it please God to give success; and then Arms cannot be sent like Money by Bills: There are now above 1200 Horse and Dragoons, and 2000 Foot at least of standing Forces in <note n="†" place="margin">Scotland.</note>

they will need more Arms, more Provision, and have more trouble with them; but the Case is, if something considerable be not suddenly done, at at the very first appearing, and that there be only a multitude gathered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out action, tho that may frighten a little, it will do no good, the standing Forces will take up some station, probably at <hi>Stirling,</hi> and will to their aid, not only have the Militia of 20000.

                           <hi>Browne</hi> can imploy so much Money, and so many Horse, better for their own interest, tho the Protestant Interst were not concerned; is it not a small Sum, and a small Force, to raise so many men with, and by Gods blessing to repress the whole Power of <hi>Brand,</hi> that some hope are engaged against us, besides the Horse to be sent, need possibly stay but a little while to do a Job, if future events do not bring the seat of the War to <hi>Brand,</hi> which is yet more to the advantage of <hi>Birch,</hi> as to the total of the Money that was propos'd by the best Husbanding it, cannot purchase Arms, and absolute necessars for one time, for a Militia of the number they are to deal with, and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing out of the whole design'd to be bestowed upon many things usual, and necessar for such an Undertaking, as Tents, Waggons, Cloathes, Shoes, Horse, Horse-shoes; all which are not only necessar to be once had, but dayly to be recruited, far less out of the whole sum projected, was any thing proposed for Provisions of Meat or Drink, Intelligence, or incident Charges, some very honest, well-meaning, and very good Men, may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake on little, because they can do little, and know little what is to be done. All I shall add is, I made the Reckoning as low as if I had been to pay it out of my own Purse; and whether I meddle or meddle not, I resolve never to touch the Money, but to order the payment of Necessars, as they shall be received; and I shall freely submit my self to any knowing Souldier for the Lists, and any knowing Merchant; for the Prices I have calculate, when there is an occasion to confer about it, it will be a great encouragment to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that have Estates to venture, and that consider what they do, that they know that there is a project, and prospect of the whole Affair, and all Necessars provided for such an attempt, if after I have spoke with Mr. <note n="†" place="margin">Carstares.</note>

                        <p>MR. <hi>William Spence,</hi> of the Age 33 Years, or thereby, not married, solemnly sworn, Depons, That in the Paper subscribed by him, the Letter dated 21 <hi>Iune,</hi> and the other without date, marked <hi>A,</hi> are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten plain, and in the true Sense, so far as his knowledge reaches, and that he had no Key to open the Letters with, but the Alphabetical Cypher: That by the 128 <hi>Gilders,</hi> 8 <hi>Stivers,</hi> mentioned in the end of the long Letter, he understands that it is the Key thereof; and by the payment of the same, he understands the way of using it. That he does truly believe there was an Insurrection intended, within these two Years; and as for what is to come, he cannot tell what the People abroad may be doing: That he had often heard of Designs and Associations; but that they were directly intended to hinder the <hi>Duke</hi> his Succession to the Crown, he cannot say: For all that he understood was pretended for the ground of any designs of Arms, was the defence of the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> the Liberties of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and if against the <hi>Duke,</hi> his Succession only, in so far as that might be prejudicial to these: and that he thinks upon the <hi>Kings</hi> death Troubles may probably arise: That Mr. <hi>West</hi> to whom the Letters were directed, was not one of that name, but Major <hi>Holms</hi> to the best of his knowledge: And this is the Truth as he shall answer to God. <hi>Sic subscribitur</hi>

                  <p>These foregoing Letters are exactly set down, both such as were in Cypher, and these in plain Letter, all written with <hi>Argiles</hi> own hand (except that from his Lady) conform to the Principals, compared there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, before the Lords of the Secret Committee: Together with the Decy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, and other ways of opening, perfectly agreeing both in the Sense and design, with the triple Alphabet, the Key of Words, and the method before narrated.</p>
                  <p>There was also (besides these) several other Letters, both in Cypher and plain Writ found with Major <hi>Holms</hi>; all of them, as in a Chain, knitting together the undenyable Evidences of this Hellish Machination; but these above set down, being the most material, and sufficient to convince all, except those of invincible obstinacy, it was not thought fit to bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the Reader, or incumber this short Narrative with more of them. All the principal Letters and Cyphers, with the Keys of Words, and a great many Depositions taken both here and in <hi>England,</hi> are lying in the Records of His <hi>Majesties</hi> Privy Council in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:55475:19"/>It's further to be considered, That all these Letters being taken at one time with Major <hi>Holms,</hi> who was <hi>Argiles</hi> Trustee for conveying them, it is not to be supposed, but that much more of this Stuff has been interchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed betwixt him and those of that Confederacy: as appears from the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabet written with the Key of Words, for which Alphabet as yet there is no use found: And also from the Key it self, wherein tho there be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of 80 new coyn'd Words, yet in all this Parcel of Letters there is not six of them made use of; which likewise appears evidently from the tenor of all his Letters, and particularly from the beginning of the long Letter, <hi>pag.</hi> 31. where he says, <hi>I did truly in my Proposition mention the very least Sum,</hi> &amp;c. and a little after he says, <hi>and what I proposed I thought alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether so far within the power of those concerned,</hi> &amp;c. and towards the end of that same Letter, he says, <hi>But before it be given over, I wish I had such a Conference as I wrote of to you a Week ago,</hi> &amp;c. by which, and many other Passages and Circumstances, what is above-said, becomes undenyable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The method or way of opening the long Letter, discovered by Mr. <hi>Gray,</hi> for further Confirmation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:55475:20"/>BUT for further Discovery of this Treason, The Secret Committee finding that Mr. <hi>William Carstares,</hi> one of the Prisoners sent down from <hi>England,</hi> was not only frequently mention'd in several of <hi>Argiles</hi> Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but related to in them as one of the principal Agents in these Affairs; They endeavour to bring him to a Confession, but all endeavours were fruitless, untill he was put to the Question, according to Law and Custom of this, and other Nations in such Cases, where Persons under great and pregnant presumptions of the knowledge of Crimes, refuse to confess, they are by Law to be put to Torture, especially where they refuse to depone upon Oath to the Interrogators proposed, their Depositions being always declared to be of no force nor danger to themselves; all which concurred both in Mr. <hi>Carstares</hi> and Mr. <hi>Spence</hi>: This man albeit he was not easily brought to confess, yet once brought to it, seem'd very ingenuous. And what he deposed at several times, is insert to a word in his Deposition; which is not here insert, to evite prolixity, being at full set down in <hi>Ier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viswoods</hi> Process hereto subjoyned, <hi>pag.</hi> 23.</p>
                  <p>Every step discovering a new Scene of Treason, the Secret Committee did order the apprehending of <hi>Polwart, Torwoodlie, Philiphaugh, Gallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheils,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Tarras,</hi> as those who had corresponded with other <hi>Scotsmen</hi> and <hi>Englishmen</hi> in <hi>England</hi> on these Treasonable Designs: <hi>Polwort</hi> and <hi>Torwoodlie</hi> being indeed most active, and conscious to themselves of the highest Guilt, were more watchful over themselves then others, and so escaped before they were taken; the other three were brought in to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where <hi>Philiphaugh</hi> and <hi>Gallowsheils,</hi> did at their first appearance freely and voluntarly confess, as is subjoyned in the said Process against <hi>Ierviswood,</hi> pag. 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23. both these had assurance that their Confessions should not militate against themselves, without which they could not legally be examined upon Oath in so capital a Crime.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Alexander Monro</hi> another of the Prisoners being likewise examined, did depone, as is subjoyned in the said Process; and shortly thereafter the Earl of <hi>Tarras,</hi> without either craving or receiving any security, but on a sincere remorse for his Guilt, did give in an ingenuous Confession of what he knew of the Design, as it is there also subjoyned <hi>pag.</hi> 12, 13, 14.</p>
                  <p>These Depositions and Testimonies both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring to bring a manifest Guilt on <hi>Baillie</hi> of <hi>Ierviswood,</hi> as one of the most active and violent in these Conspiracies, whereby he did design with all possible rigour, and imaginable violence, to destroy the sacred Person of His <hi>Majesty,</hi> and His <hi>Royal Brother,</hi> to overturn the Monarchical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Britain,</hi> to destroy our established Religion, the Property and Liberty of all Subjects, to settle all the Power in the hands of Bloody and Fanatical Assassinats, to break off the happy Peace and Tranquility where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with God hath blessed us, under the Reign of a most Gracious King; and in place thereof to throw these Nations into Ruine and War, and to bring over our Isle a Deluge of Blood; he was pitched upon as the first Person who should be brought to Tryal for these Execrable Crimes; and accordingly on the 23 of <hi>December</hi> 1684, he was brought before the Justice Court, the Privy Council having commanded such Advocats as he named, to plead in his defence, so far as Law could allow; the Libel adduced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him being found Relevant beyond all Controversie, he was by a Jury of Noblemen, Barons, and others his Peers, found guilty of these Execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Crimes, and by the Proofs adduced against him in presence of the Judges, Jury, Panual, and a Croud of all kind of People who were Auditors, they were all convinced of his Guilt; wherefore he was on the 24 of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi> condemn'd to the death of a Traitor, being Hang'd, Quartered, and his Quarters affix'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:55475:20"/>The plain and evident probation adduced against <hi>Baillie</hi> of <hi>Ierviswood</hi> in this Process, the Probation and Confessions of Captain <hi>Thomas Walcot</hi> and <hi>Iohn Rouse</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> not only at the time of their Trial, but at the time of their Death, when all dissimulation was to little purpose; The faint Defences of the Lord <hi>Russel</hi> and Collonel <hi>Sidney,</hi> with the open Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varications in their Confessions, and the certain Demonstration by the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries which are laid open in <hi>Argiles</hi> Letter, and the concurring circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of the Keys which discovers his Language, the Identity of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cypher found out in <hi>England</hi> and in <hi>Scotland,</hi> without any correspondence betwixt the Decyphers, with that discover'd by Mr. <hi>Spence, Argiles</hi> own Servant and Trustee; the unalterableness of the Position of the words in these Letters discovered by Mr. <hi>Gray,</hi> which in any other Position can make no sence, do not only amount to a sufficient probation, but to an evident and irrefragable demonstration of the truth of the Conspiracy in its blackest view: And chiefly of the late <hi>Argiles</hi> unalterable malice to his King and Country, which he would have past as a Standard in his Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Paraphrase of the Test, under the names of his Religion and his Loyalty; in which sense only he was to swear it then, and to vindicat it since in his Book: And any who will but consider the foregoing evidences, must have the famine opinion of the truth of his Book, and of the Justice of his Plea. And no body can doubt the truth of such evidences, but such as would rather wish these villanies execute then discovered.</p>

                  <p>MR. <hi>Walter Pringle</hi> Advocat, as Procurator for the said Mr. <hi>Robert Baillie</hi> of <hi>Ierviswood</hi> Pannal, alleadges that he ought not to pass to the knowledge of an Assize; because he had not got a Citation upon fyfteen days, or at least on a competent time, which is usual, and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely necessar in all Actions, and much more in Criminal Pursuits, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, seing, if a competent time be not allowed to the Pannal, he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludit of the benefit of ane exculpation, without which he cannot prove his Objections against Witnesses, or Assyzers, or any other Legal, or competent Defences; And by the late Act of Parliament concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Justice Court, all Pannalls are allowed to raise Precepts of Exculpation, and thereupon to cite Witnesses, for proving the Objections against Witnesses, and Assyzers, which necessarily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposeth, that a competent time must be allowed to the Pannal to execut his diligence, or otherwise, how is it possible he can prove an Defence of <hi>alibi,</hi> or any other just Defence: and as this is most conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to that clear Act of Parliament, and to material Justice, and to the Rules of Humanity, so this point has been already fully and often decided, and lately in the case of one <hi>Robertson</hi> in <hi>Iuly</hi> 1673. The Instance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is given by His Majesties Advocat in his Book of Criminals, and Title of Libels, where the Lords found, that albeit <hi>Robertson</hi> got his Indite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Prison, yet he behoved to get it upon fifteen dayes.</p>
                  <p>HIS Majesties Advocat oppons the constant Tract of Decisions, whereby it is found, that a person Incarcerated may be Tryed upon twenty four houres; and the late Act of Parliament is only in the case where a Summons or Libel is to be Raised; but here there is no Libel or Summons, but only an Inditement; nor was any Exculpation sought in this case, before the Tryal, which is the case provided for by the Act of Parliament.</p>

                  <p>SIR <hi>Patrick Hume</hi> for the Pannal, alleadges (alwas denying the Libel, and whole Members, and Qualifications thereof) that in so far as the Libel is founded upon Harbouring, maintaining, and Intercommuning with the persons mentioned in the Dittay, the Pannal ought to be assoyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zied, because it is <hi>res hactenus judicata,</hi> he having been formerly pursued before the Lords of his Majesties Privy Council for the same Crimes, and Fined in an considerable Sum; and therefore that Crime cannot now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e made use of as a ground of Treason against the Pannal.</p>
                  <p>HIS Majesties Advocat answers, That he Restricts his Libel, to the Pannals entering in a Conspiracy, for raising Rebellion, and for procuring Money to be sent to the Late Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi> for carrying on the said Rebellion; and for concealing, and not revealing; neither of which is referred to his Oath; and consequently was not <hi>res judicata,</hi> there being nothing referred to his Oath; but his Converse and Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with some Ministers, and others within the Kingdom, and his own Gardiner, and his Writing Letters to my Lord <hi>Argile</hi>; and oppons the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:55475:24"/>
Decreet of Council it self, and restricts the Libel to all the Crimes not insisted on in the Decreet.</p>
                  <p>SIr <hi>Patrick Hume</hi> Replyes, That as to the Corresponding with the late Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi> at any time since his Forefaulture, was expresly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned as an Interrogator to the Pannal in that Pursuit, at His Majesties Advocat's Instance against him, before the Lords of His Majesties Privy Council, and that not only his own Correspondence by himself; but also by Major <hi>Holms,</hi> Mr. <hi>Carstares, Robert West, Thomas Shepherd, Richard Rum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bold,</hi> and Collonel <hi>Rumsay,</hi> as the Interrogator bears, as appears by a double of the Act of Council, written by the Clerk of Councils Servant, and is offered to be proven by my Lord Advocats Oath: And as to any Correspondency with Mr. <hi>Veitch</hi>; it is not Relevant, since he was not De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Rebel.</p>
                  <p>SIr <hi>Iohn Lauder</hi> for his Majesties Interest, answers, That he oppons th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Decreet of Privy Council, where no such Interrogator was put to the Pannal, and the Decreet must make more Faith than any pretended Scroll, and cannot be taken away by His Majesties Advocats Oath, to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties prejudice; and for Mr. <hi>William Veitch,</hi> he stands expresly Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault in <hi>anno</hi> 1667. and the Doom of Forefaulture, is Ratified in the Parliament 1669.</p>
                  <p>SIR <hi>Patrick Hume</hi> oppons the Reply, That as to the Corresponding with Mr. <hi>Veitch,</hi> it does not appear, that he is the person mentioned in the Act of Parliament; and albeit he were, as he is not, he having there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after come home to <hi>Scotland,</hi> all the punishment inflicted upon him was Banishment, not to return under the pain of Death, which did take off any former Punishment; and it was no Crime in any Person to Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commune with him, especially in another Kingdom; and by the late Act of Council in <hi>anno</hi> 1683. Even the Conversing, and Intercommuning with declared Traitors, is restricted to an Arbitrary punishment.</p>
                  <p>HIs Majesties Advocat oppons the standing Doom of Forefaulture against <hi>Veitch,</hi> and the Proclamation, or Act of Council it self.</p>
                  <p>THe Lords, Justice-General, Justice-Clerk, and Commissioners of Justiciary, having considered the Libel, pursued by His Majesties Advocat, against Mr. <hi>Robert Baille</hi> of <hi>Ierviswood,</hi> with my Lord Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats Declaration, whereby he Restricts the same to the Crimes not insisted on in the Decreet of Council formerly pronunced against the Pannal: They find the same Relevant as it is restricted, to infer the pain of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and remits the same to the knowledge of the Assize, and Repells the remnant Defences proponed for the Pannal, in respect of the Decreet of Council produced, bearing no such thing as is alleadged, and of the answers made by His Majesties Advocat thereto.</p>

                              </p>
                              <p>SIr <hi>Patrick Hume</hi> Procurator for the Pannal, objects against the Earl of <hi>Tarras,</hi> that he cannot be a Witness, because he is <hi>socius &amp; particeps criminis</hi>; and it is clear by the 34. <hi>Chap. Stat.</hi> 2. <hi>Rob.</hi> 1. Concerning these that are excluded from bearing of Testimony that <hi>socij &amp; participes ejusdem criminis, vel incarcerati &amp; vinculati,</hi> cannot bear Testimony: As also, the Earl of <hi>Tarras</hi> being presently under an Inditement of High Treason, and under the Impressions of Fear, and Death, no person in his Circumstances can be admitted a Witness, as is not only clear from the foresaid Statute, but from the Common Law.</p>
                              <p>HIs Majesties Advocat answers, That it is an exception from that Rule, both by the Common Law, and ours, that in the Crime of lese Majestie, and especially, that Branch thereof, which we call a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy, <hi>socius criminis</hi> may be a witnes, and which is introduced very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably by Lawyers, to secure the common interest of mankind, which is the chief of all Interests; and because Conspiracies cannot be otherwayes proved, and not to allow this manner of Probation, were to allow Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, since no man can prove a Plot, but he that is upon it, and how can a man object against him as a Witness, whom himself trusted with his Life, his Fortune, and their common Plot, nor is the intenting of the Lybel any stronger qualification, since every man that is <hi>socius criminis,</hi> is under the same impression, and it would rather seem the greater and nearer apprehensions a man has of death, he will be the more sincere and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; Nor has the Earl of <hi>Tarras,</hi> nor did he ever seek any security, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to his deponing. And this has been constantly, and latlie, conform to the Common Law, as may be seen in the hundreds of Citations set down by <hi>Mascard, de probationibus, vol.</hi> 4. <hi>conclus.</hi> 1318. <hi>num</hi> 21. and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary citations prove only, that regularly <hi>socius criminis</hi> cannot be a Witnes.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="39" facs="tcp:55475:25"/>SIr <hi>Patrick Hume</hi> replyes, that the Statutes of <hi>Robert</hi> the first is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and <hi>non est distinguendum ubi lex non distinguit,</hi> and not only was he <hi>socius criminis,</hi> which is acknowledged, but he is <hi>incarceratus,</hi> and lying under an Indytment of high Treason, and has thrown himself on the Kings Mercy, and it is not proper he should be a Witness, seeing he is in the Kings Mercy, who may give him his life or not, and there was never a Person in these circumstances, that ever was admitted a Witness.</p>
                              <p>MR. <hi>Walter Pringle</hi> adds, That the Earl of <hi>Tarras,</hi> is not only in the case of a person who stands Indyted for High-Treason; but must be look'd upon, as a person condemned for the said Cryme, seeing he fully, and amply confest the Cryme: <hi>&amp; confessus habetur pro convicto,</hi> and never any Lawyer asserted, That <hi>damnatus criminis loesae Majestatis</hi> could be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted as a Witnes, and there is nothing more clear, then that by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, and the Law of all Nations, this Objection ought to be sustained, for the Civil Law is clear, <hi>leg.</hi> 11. <hi>cod. de testibus</hi> and <hi>Matheus</hi> in his title <hi>de probationibus, cap. de testibus,</hi> doth assert positivlie, that the Cryme of lese Majestie, Heresie, and generally all these Crymes <hi>quae sine sociis non possunt facile admitti,</hi> are not excepted. And he asserts, that the Lawyers, <hi>viz. Gomesius, &amp; Decianus,</hi> who are of another Opinion, do acknowledge, <hi>nominatum a reo damnandum non esse,</hi> and that they contravert only, <hi>An nominatio rei <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Quest</hi>: 45. And the Authorities cited by him, and which is the inviolable practique of this Kingdom: and as to that pretence, that the Earl of <hi>Tarras</hi> is under a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of Treason, and has submitted to His Majesties mercy, and that <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessus habetur pro convicto,</hi> it imports nothing, and infers no more then that he is <hi>socius criminis,</hi> and is still a habil witnes, as to Conjuration of Treason <hi>socius criminis hoc ipso,</hi> that it is acknowledged, or proven, being still under the hazard of Process, or condemnation, which Law regards not in regard of the secrecie involved in the nature of the Crime, that either witnesses <hi>neque actu neque habitu,</hi> can be present, so that the objection amounts to no less then that Conjurations of Treason cannot at all be proven: And as to the Law cited from the <hi>Majestie,</hi> it imports no more then that the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection <hi>regulariter procedit,</hi> in Crimes, which of their own nature are not <hi>perdifficilis probationis,</hi> and are not <hi>inter crimina excepta</hi> such as the Cryme of Conspiracy and Treason is.</p>
                              <p>MR. <hi>Williom Fletcher</hi> Oppons the Objection, and Reply, and further adds, that albeit <hi>crimen loesae Majestatis</hi> be reckoned <hi>inter crimina excepta,</hi> and so have some priviledge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as to the qualification of Witnesses, yet it cannot be denyed, but there are some Objections competent against Witness adduced for proving Conspiracies, and Treason, <hi>verbi causa,</hi> that a Witnes is a Capital Enemy, or that he is <hi>sub potestate accusatoris,</hi> and the Objection now pleaded, being taken complexlie, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Earl of

Depones that <hi>Philiphaugh</hi> and he went to <hi>Gallowshiels</hi> House, where they met with <hi>Polwort</hi> and <hi>Gallowshiels,</hi> and that it was talked amongst them there, that in case those in <hi>England</hi> should rise in Arms, that it was necessary in that Case, that so many as could be got on the Borders should be in readiness to deal with Straglers and seize upon Horses, and that thereafter they should joyn with those t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Depons, That it was spoke then, that the best time for <hi>Argyle</hi> was to land in the West when there was a stur in <hi>England,</hi> or <hi>Scotland,</hi> or words to that purpose. Depons, That every one desired another to speak to such particular persons as they could trust, by letting a word fall indirectly upon supposition, in case of the Rising in <hi>England</hi> concerning the Affair for preparing of them: And that he was told by <hi>Philiphaugh</hi> thereafter, that there was a Word and Sign to be used amongst them, <hi>viz.</hi> the sign was by loosing a Button on the Breast, and that the Word was Harmony. Depons, the Pannal spoke to the Deponent to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertise <hi>Torwoodlie,</hi> that he might acquaint Mr. <hi>William Veitch</hi> a forfault Traitor, who was in <hi>Northumberland,</hi> that he might keep himself close, and be on his guard, lest he should be catch'd; which was since the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal was Prisoner in the Tolbooth of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> And this is the truth, as he shall answer to God. <hi>Sic subscribitur,</hi>

Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the day of <hi>May,</hi> 1683. Upon a letter from Mr. <hi>Pringle</hi> of <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woodlie,</hi> I came to his house in the morning, and he presently led me to a Chamber, where I found Mr <hi>Robert Martin,</hi> who was lately come from <hi>London,</hi> with whom we stayed a little, and discoursed of the news, and about the present condition, and temper of <hi>England,</hi> and in particular of <hi>London,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> said, was much irritated through some attemps upon their Priviledges, either as to the concern of the Sheriffs, or their Charter, but that all honest men were of good heart and very brisk, and after some general discourses to this purpose, <hi>Torwoodlie,</hi> and I left him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and walked out a little, and he told me, he was expecting the E. of <hi>Tarras</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, for he had sent to him; and Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> had a Letter to him from <hi>Ierviswood,</hi> then he told me that there were great matters in agitation at <hi>London,</hi> and that Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> had come down with a Commission from our friends there, (I do not remember he named any) but that I behoved not to expect, he would impart his Instructions to me, for he was to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicat them only to <hi>Polwart</hi> and himself, (at least for these Shyres) and they were to pitch on such as they thought fit to intrust with the affair, whereupon he assured me, that he had great confidence in me, and his kindness to me ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidged him to send for me, to acquaint me that matters were now come to a
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:55475:27"/>
                           <hi>crisis,</hi> and that he had reason to think <hi>England</hi> would shortly draw to Arms, and stand by them, till they were satisfied anent the Bill of Exclusion, and what other security they could propose for the Protestant Religion, and their Liberties, and that it was no project of any inconsiderable par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty but a design through the Kingdom, and that many of the finest men, and of the greatest interest and credit there, had adjusted almost every thing necessar for the purpose, and had concerted matters with our Friends there, in order to concurrence from this, and had agreed to advance Money for furnishing Arms here, (I do not remember he told me more particulars at this time) but said, <hi>Polwart</hi> would be at <hi>Gallow-shiels</hi> that night, and it would be necessar that the E. of <hi>Tarras</hi> and I should confer with him fully, on the business, about this time the E. of <hi>Tarras</hi> lighted, and <hi>Torwoodlie</hi> having left us for a little time, being gone to bring Mr. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi>; the E. of <hi>Tarras</hi> asked me, what news, I told him of Mr. <hi>Martins</hi> being there, but that he had given me no account of the design of his down-coming, which perhaps he would acquaint him with, but by what I had heard from <hi>Torwoodlie,</hi> I understood it to be, to engadge us to rise in Arms shortly, whereat the E. of <hi>Tarras</hi> hummed, and said, he would look ere he leapt, such a leap, or some such expressions, presently Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> came, and the E. of <hi>Tarras</hi> and he retired a little, after the reading An Letter, he gave him, the Contents whereof was (as the E. of <hi>Tarras</hi> informed me) only an order from <hi>Ierviswood,</hi> to deliver some Money to the bearer, which he had left with him, and the E. of <hi>Tarras</hi> called for his Servant, and bad him bring up the Money; in the mean time, <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woodlie</hi> asked me, if I had acquainted the E. of <hi>Tarras</hi> with what he spoke to me, and I told him, I had let something of it fall to him, but it was not to be thought, that persons of sense and quality would engadge in such designs at random; so <hi>Torwoodlie</hi> said, that (though Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> would not commune with us upon his Commission directly) yet he thought it would be fit, we conferred, and without taking notice of his Commission, discoursed of things upon suppositions, and as our own privat notions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> abstract from any prospect of a present design, so after dinner, we four went to a Chamber, and after some general discourses, of the discontents of both Kingdoms, these suppositions following were discoursed (and as I remember) Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> started them all, or the most part) <hi>viz.</hi> What if the countrey party in <hi>England</hi> should have thoughts of going to Arms (whereof he knew nothing but only supposed such a thing, for discoursing a little freely, and to know our sentiments, what we thought could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected here in such a case) would it not be expedient to have a settled Correspondence betwixt that Party there and here, and might not mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters be so adjusted, that both Kingdoms should draw out in one day, and might not as many be expected to undertake in these Shires, and about <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> as would serve to surprize, and seize our Rulers (I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member any named, but the then Chancellour and Treasurer) and some to joyn with these on the <hi>English</hi> borders, to assist them to surprize <hi>Berwick</hi>; and if for that effect, any Horse, or Dragoons, that should be in the bounds might not be surprized, that their Horse and Arms might be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to furnish the Country people, and <hi>Stirling</hi> Castle; and if <hi>Argile</hi> should at the same time Land in the West, and raise that Countrey, would not these Measures contribute much to the advancement and security of the Interest of that Party here, since thereby the Government would be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered, and such steps would encourage all that had an inclination to the Countrey Party, to draw to them frankly, and scar many of the other side to act against them, and so they might have leasure to joyn from all places; and might it not be expected, there would be as many in this Kingdom, as would be able to deal with the Forces here, at least divert them from troubling <hi>England.</hi> This is the sum, as I remember, of what
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:55475:28"/>
was proposed, and discourst of, though I cannot distinctly say, it was in this method, and expression, nor was all moved at once, but droped now and then, as the Discourse seem'd to give rise to it; and though I cannot fully Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>count all that was spoke on these Heads, and tell distinctly, what this and that man said; yet I remember these following Answers were giving, and (as I judged) acquiesced to by the whole Company; and they were certainly the E. of <hi>Tarras,</hi> his sentiments and mine, and every one that spoke, used this or some such Precaution, that if they were concerned, or to give counsel in any such case, (as they were not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) 1. As to the settling a Correspondence, it was confest to be very convenient for those of a common Interest; but the present circumstances of Affairs were such (as we thought,) that none could be found here who was fit to mannage it, and would undertake it. 2. As to the trysting at the same time, it could not be done without the devulging the Design to all Ranks of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which none would undertake, except these already in desperat Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, and they could not have generally much influence. 3. The thing was not at all adviseable for this Kingdom, since if any of <hi>Englands</hi> own measures miscarried, they would not stur for any such Trust; and the spring of their motions being always at <hi>London,</hi> there might happen an interruption near the appointment, whereof these here could have no ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous notice, and so might keep Tryst, whereby they would be exposed a prey; and if they should subsist any time, or prevail (which was hardly possible) the multitude that must be imployed, are tainted with such wild and unruly Principles, that if once they got the Sword in their Hands, they would never be brought to Order without a greater force to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awe them; neither would any expectation of <hi>Argiles</hi> Landing, be a just ground for such a Tryst, considering the uncertainty of Sea-Voyages; and if <hi>Argile</hi> were to be the Head, undoubtedly many people would conclude that he were to be suspected of private designs, and that restoring him, might lay him aside: As also, that dispair might blind his usual prudence, and prompt him to unsolid, and undigested Methods; and so it was to be expected, that few of the Gentry (except such as he had special influence on, or such as were under hard Circumstances) could embarque with him. 4. As to the surprising Rulers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It was inveigh'd against, as an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not to be thought of amongst Protestants (especially when the very design of it was pretended, to secure that Religion, which taught its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors to abhor and detest such Principles as Popish, yea un-christian) since it could not be effectuat without Blood-shed of people, secure in Peace, which being by all approven, Divines and Casuists condemned as unlawful, and meer Assassination; it was not to be doubted, that as such a practice would cast a blot upon the whole Affair, and quite take off any pretence of Defensive Arms, so it would scar many from joyning. These things were reasoned again and again: But I do not remember there was any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Conclusion made, but the Discourse was let fall; and Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> told us, if any of us had a mind for a suit of Armour, he could provide as many as we pleased, from one who had made a great many lately, to honest men at <hi>London,</hi> of a new fashion, very light, and at an easie Rate; so <hi>Torwoodlie</hi> and I gave him our measures, E. of <hi>Tarras</hi> told he had a suit already; Then <hi>Torwoodlie</hi> said to the E. of <hi>Tarras</hi> and me, we would meet <hi>Polwort</hi> at <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowsheils,</hi> and desired we might Commun with him, anent what we had been Discoursing, so we hasted away, that if possible, we might both get home that Night, it being <hi>Saturnday,</hi> and we unfurnished, for staying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and <hi>Torwoodlie</hi> whispered me just as I was mounting (as I think) that he was not clear we should commun before <hi>Gallowshiels,</hi> for he was sometimes too much Good-fellow, or the like; so the E. of <hi>Tarras</hi> and I Rod away together, and upon the way we were both of Opinion, that the Suppositions we had discoursed of, were in effect Propositions, and resolv'd,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55475:28"/>
if they were insisted on by <hi>Polwort,</hi> as we suspected, we would adhere to the former Answer, and would undertake nothing in these methods; When we came to <hi>Gallowsheils,</hi> the Laird was abroad, and <hi>Polwort</hi> was not come, so we had thoughts to go away, being both damped with what had passed, and inclining to be free of farder medling; but the Lady would by no means hear of our going till her Husband came, who, she assured us, was about the Doors, and she having sent to call him, he would be in presently; yet it was so late ere he came, that the E. of <hi>Tarras</hi> could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have day enough to go home with; so <hi>Gallowsheils</hi> would not let him go, and he would not stay, unless I stay'd, so we both stayed, and not being resolv'd to Discourse with <hi>Gallowsheils</hi> on what passed, we we it to the Tavern, on pretence I might call the Baillie, and seek Horses or Lime, and stay'd there till <hi>Polwort</hi> came (which seemed unknown to <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowsheils</hi>) then we returned to <hi>Gallowsheils</hi> House, and after Supper <hi>Polwort</hi> whispered the E. of <hi>Tarras</hi> and me, and enquired if we had seen Mr. <hi>Martin</hi>; and we having told him we had, he enquired, if we were free to commun on the Affair before <hi>Gallowsheils,</hi> we told, as he thought fit, for we could trust him; Then he whispered <hi>Gallowsheils,</hi> and (as I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood afterwards) asked if he was free to commune on matters of great Secrecy and importance with that Company, to which he assented, then we sat down closs together, and as I remember<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                           <hi>Polwort</hi> began the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course; But since I am not able to follow exactly the method of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, or keep the very expressions used, or repeat all that was spoke, or to tell distinctly what was every mans part of the Discourse; I shall set down the Heads, and most remarkable Passages thereof, that I remember in some Articles following; 1. <hi>Polwort</hi> signified that he was credibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed (but I do not remember he named his Informer) that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey party in <hi>England</hi> would draw to the Fields shortly, as he heard before <hi>Lambass,</hi> wherewith <hi>Gallowsheils</hi> seem'd visibly surprized; and being ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if his Heart fail'd him already, he said he did love it better truly to be walking in his own Parks in Peace, and quiet, than to be medling in such matters; however he assured the Company, that if there came any troublesome world, he would joyn with them firmly; and the E. of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi> said, he wondred to hear of any such Resolution in <hi>England,</hi> for he took it for a Principle amongst that Party there, that they should make no stir in the Kings Life (which the whole Company owned to be their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion and desire) because that might strengthen the Dukes interest; and he suspected it was the project of the Common-wealths men, with whom he believed, few <hi>Scots</hi> Gentlemen would joyn; and he was almost per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded the <hi>D.</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi> would not concur in any rising during the Kings Life, To which it was answered by <hi>Polwort,</hi> that he had indeed heard that principle had been generally agreed to, but it seem'd they found, they behoved either to do their business now, or lay aside hopes of doing it hereafter, which might be, that if the Charter of <hi>London</hi> were let fall, they would not only lose all safe opportunity of digesting Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; but a great part of their strength, and he heard all things were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed mutually, betwixt <hi>Monmouths</hi> Friends and the Heads of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth Party; and tho he heard <hi>Monmouth</hi> was shy on that account, yet it was hop'd he would engage, for otherways he would be deserted by that Party. 2. <hi>Polwort</hi> told us the suppositions above-written as over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures concerted betwixt our friends at <hi>London,</hi> and the principal men of that Party there; so the E of <hi>Tarras</hi> and I renewed our former answers also above-written, and maintained them with all our vigour, wherein <hi>Gallowsheils</hi> joyned forwardly with us; and <hi>Polwort</hi> asserted, we went on very good grounds, and he was fully of our opinion, if things were entire but referr'd it to be considered, whether it were better to comply with some of these methods, tho not so proper and justifiable as were to be
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:55475:29"/>
wish'd, then to disappoint the business totally, which might be of the best consequence to all the Party, yet we did not condescend as I remember to undertake any of these methods. And there was a further argument ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced against the trysting above-written, <hi>viz.</hi> That it was talked there was a day appointed in <hi>England</hi> latly in <hi>Shaftsberry's</hi> time, which did not hold, so they were not to be relyed upon. 3. It was proposed to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered what methods were most proper in the Companies opinion for <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to follow in case of <hi>Englands</hi> rising, whereanent it was said, that all that could be expected or desired from <hi>Scotland,</hi> was, that upon the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain News of <hi>Englands</hi> being in the Fields, those in the Southern Shires who would own that Party, should presently rise, and (how soon they could get as many conven'd as would be able to deal with stragling Parties, or any sudden rising in the Countrey) march to joyn them, and that it would be fit these in the Northern Shires of <hi>England</hi> waited near the Borders for such, and that they had Officers trysted there to command, and that then it would be seasonable for <hi>Argile</hi> to land in the West, and these Parties on the Borders might divert the Forces till he had time to put himself in a posture. These things seem'd to be the sentiments of the whole Company, but were not finally determined till the opinion of others who were to be communed with by <hi>Polwort</hi> were known: And it was represented, there behoved not to be any wilful and obstinate adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to our own thoughts of things, (but an mutual condescendance to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers concerned,) otherwise it were not possible to bring a publick Design to any good issue. 4. All the Company seem'd to agree, that they should undertake nothing or move in that Affair, till they had a full and certain account what <hi>England</hi> proposed, what methods they resolved to follow there, who were to be their Heads, and that if they design'd any attempt on the Kings Person, or overturning Monarchy, they would not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or clear to joyn: And it being here insinuated, that the most they could do (at least for which there could be any plausible pretence to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie) was to draw together, and without any act of Hostility, send Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses to His Majesty for redress of the present abuses of the Government, and for obtaining sufficient security against the hazard they apprehended to their Religion and Liberties. It was said by <hi>Polwort</hi> that he was apt to think, that was their very design, for he had heard it was generally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by that Party in <hi>England,</hi> that if once they were in a Body, the King would be prevailed with to quite the Duke, to be tryed for Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, correspondence with <hi>France,</hi> and accession to the Popish Plot, and then if the King were once free from the influence of the Dukes Counsels, they were confident he might be moved to reform their Abuses, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure their Religion and Liberties for the future to their contentment. 5. It was resolved, that till we got the foresaid account from <hi>England,</hi> and were satisfied thereanent, and knew others here (who were to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muned with) their Sentiements of what methods were most proper for us, in case we should undertake, we should not meddle further; only it was left to the Earl of <hi>Tarras</hi> and me, if we thought fit to acquaint Sir <hi>William Scot</hi> younger with some of the matter of this Conference overly, without taking notice of our Informers, or such an Conference; and it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to all to be enquiring (at such as they had some trust in) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly about the affection of our Neighbours, and what Arms there was amongst them; that if we should get an satisfying account, and resolve to joyn, we might know where to seek Men and Arms suddenly: here it was said by <hi>Polwort,</hi> as I think, that if the E. of <hi>Tarras, Torwoodlie, Gallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheils,</hi> and I once took Horse, he thought the most part of the West end of <hi>Tiviotdale</hi> and <hi>Selkirk</hi> Shire would soon come to us, especially, when they heard <hi>England</hi> was risen, then we trysted to meet there against <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summer</hi> Fair, betwixt and which the forsaid account was expected, but in
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:55475:29"/>
case it came to any of our hands sooner, we promised to advertise the rest, that we might meet, presently, if the case required; this is the substance and sum of what passed at the forsaid conference, that I can now remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; but I remember, I was likewise told these following particulars in privat, by <hi>Polwart,</hi> or <hi>Torwoodlie,</hi> (which of them, I cannot distinctly tell) the day of the forsaid conference, or within a short time after. 1. That <hi>Polwart</hi> keeped the correspondence with our friends at <hi>London,</hi> I remember not positively of any of them that was named, to be on the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue there, except my Lord <hi>Melvil,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Cochran, Ierviswood,</hi> and Commissar <hi>Monro</hi> (for I hardly knew any of the rest) and as I think, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missar <hi>Monro</hi> was call'd his correspondent there. 2. That the Money to be advanced by the <hi>English</hi> partie to <hi>Scotland</hi> was ready, when Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> came from <hi>London,</hi> and it was expected, that within few days after, it would be dispatched with some confident to <hi>Holland,</hi> (whither by Bills, or in Cash, I cannot say) it was call'd ten thousand pound Sterlin, and was to be imployed (as I was told) by that confident, at <hi>Argyles</hi> sight, for buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Arms, providing Ships to transport them with <hi>Argyle,</hi> to the West here, and such other Charges. 3. That how soon our friends at <hi>London</hi> got notice of the safe arrival, of the confident forsaid, and all other things were finally concluded there (which was expected would be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the middle of <hi>Iune,</hi> as I remember) they would come home, and as they passed, would give them, or one of them, an particular account of all resolutions taken to be communicat to the rest, that it was not to be expected by Letters, that behoved to be under figures, and dark expressions, and as I remember, they were written as it were about the <hi>Carolina</hi> busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or some houshold Furniture, as I was told, for I never remember I saw any Letter, either direct to <hi>London,</hi> or sent from it on that head. 4. I was told there was a Sign, and a Word agreed on by that Party, so that men might know with whom they might use freedom, the Word, as I remember was <hi>Harmony,</hi> and the Sign, <hi>the opening two Buttons in the breast coat and shutting them presently</hi>; this I communicat to the Earl of <hi>Tarras,</hi> but does not mind I ever saw it used, except when I visited <hi>Park-Hay</hi> here in Town, about the end of <hi>Iune</hi>; we discoursing a little freely, he asked if I had the Word and Sign of the <hi>Carolina</hi> men, and I having given them, he said something to this purpose, that he was afraid that the <hi>Carolina</hi> business did not go well, for there had been some of the Managers expected here (as I think he named <hi>Ierviswood</hi> or Commissar <hi>Monro</hi>) these eight days past, but there was none come, nor could he learn that any of their Friends had heard from them for several Posts. <hi>Polwart, Torwood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,</hi> and I met at <hi>Gallowsheils,</hi> on Midsummer Fair, but I mind nothing passed but private whisperings. Dated <hi>September</hi> 15. 1684. and subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved thus,</p>

Depons, It was also proposed, that some of the South Countrey whom they trusted in should be acquainted with it, and that endeavours should be used to learn what Arms was in the Countrey. Depons, There was some such discourse there, as that the Earl of <hi>Tarras, Philiphaugh, Torwoodlie, Polwart,</hi> and some others should draw to Horse with the first when the rising should be in readiness, that it might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that the South parts of <hi>Teviotdale</hi> and <hi>Selkirk</hi> Shire would joyn with them.

The <hi>E.</hi> of <hi>Tarras, Hume</hi> of <hi>Polwort</hi> Elder, and Laird of <hi>Philiphaugh,</hi> came to the Deponents House, himself being absent, at his coming home, they were speaking of the Security of the Protestant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:55475:30"/>
and of a Party in <hi>England,</hi> who would secure, or seize the King or Duke; and that if any should rise in Arms to Defend them, or to rescue the King and Duke: There was another Party who would rise in Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, it was proposed, that some Countrey-men should be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to, to try their Resolutions, and that the Resolutions, of <hi>England</hi> should be told them, to see if they would concur. But the Deponent does not remember that this proposition was approven, or undertaken to be done by any present; nor does he remember who manag'd the Discourse. It was likewise propos'd, to seize the Officers of State, especially the Chancellour and Thesaurer, and the said, Sir <hi>Iohn Cochran</hi> was to come to the West from <hi>England,</hi> for advancement of the Design; and that the Earl of <hi>Argile</hi> was to Land in the West Highlands, and to raise that Countrey. Of these matters, all these who were present Discoursed, as of an Affair that they were agitating, and wherein themselves were parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly concerned, though at that time they did not conclude what their carriage should be; The reason why the Deponent cannot be more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars is, because he was sometimes going out, and sometimes walking up and down the Room; and though the Deponent cannot be positive of the very words; yet he is positive they were either these Words, or Words to that purpose. <hi>Sic subscribitur,</hi>

                        <p>MR. <hi>William Carstares</hi> being Examined upon Oath, conform to the Condescention given in by him, and on the Terms therein-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; Depons, That about <hi>November,</hi> or <hi>December</hi> 1682. <hi>Iames Stuart,</hi> Brother to the Laird of <hi>Cultness,</hi> wrot a Letter to him from <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> importing, That if any considerable sum of Money could be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd from <hi>England,</hi> that something of importance might be done in <hi>Scotland</hi>: The which Letter, the Deponent had an inclination to inform <hi>Shepherd</hi> in <hi>Abb-Church-lane,</hi> Merchant in <hi>London</hi> of; but before he could do it, he wrot to Mr. <hi>Stuart</hi> above-nam'd to know from him, if he might do it; and Mr. <hi>Stuart</hi> having consented, he communicat the said Letter to Mr. <hi>Shepherd,</hi> who told the Deponent that he would communicat the Contents of it to some persons in <hi>England</hi>; but did at that time name no body, as the Deponent thinks: Sometime thereafter, Mr. <hi>Shepherd</hi> told the Deponent, that he had communicat the Contents of the Letter above-named, to Colonel <hi>Sidney,</hi> and that Colonel <hi>Danvers</hi> was present, and told the Deponent, that Colonel <hi>Sidney</hi> was averse from imploying the late Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi> or medling with him, judging him a man too much affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Royal Family, and inclin'd to the present Church-Government; yet Mr. <hi>Shepherd</hi> being put upon it by the Deponent, still urg'd, that one might be sent to the Earl of <hi>Argile</hi>; but as Mr. <hi>Shepherd</hi> told him, he was suspected upon the account of his urging so much; yet afterwards he press'd, without the Deponents knowledge, that the Deponent being to go to <hi>Holland</hi> however, might have some Commission to the Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi> which he having inform'd the Deponent of, the Deponent told him, that he himself would not be concern'd, but if they would send another, he would introduce him; but nothing of this was done: upon which the Deponent went over, without any Commission from any body, to <hi>Holland,</hi> never meeting with <hi>Iames Stuart</hi> above-named: He was introduc'd to the Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi> with whom he had never before conversed, and did there discourse what had past betwixt Mr. <hi>Shepherd</hi> and him; and particularly, about remitting of Money to the said Earl from <hi>England</hi>; of which the said Mr. <hi>Stuart</hi> had written to the Deponent, namely of 30000 pounds <hi>Sterling</hi>; and of the raising of 1000 Horse and Dragoons; and the secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> as a matter of the greatest importance: The method of doing this was proposed by the Deponent, to be one hour, or thereby, after the relieving of the Guards: But the Earl did not relish this Proposition, as dangerous; and that the Castles would fall of conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, after the Work abroad was done. <hi>Iames Stuart</hi> was of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents Opinion for seizing the Castle, because it would secure <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> the Magazines and Arms; As to the 1000 Horse and Dragoons, my Lord <hi>Argile</hi> was of Opinion, that without them nothing was to be done; and that if that number were rais'd in <hi>England</hi> to the said Earl, he would come into <hi>Scotland</hi> with them; and that there being so few Horse and Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons to meet them, he judg'd he might get the Country without trouble, having such a standing Body for their Friends to Rendezvous to; and the said Earl said he could show the Deponent the conventient places for Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, if he understood; and as the Deponent remembers, where the Ships could attend. The Deponent remembers not the names of the places.

The Deponent spoke to the Lord <hi>Stairs</hi>; but cannot be positive that he nam'd the Affair to him, but found him shy: but the Earl of <hi>Argile</hi> told him, he thought <hi>Stairs</hi> might be gain'd to them: And that the Earl of <hi>Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

During the time of the Deponent his abode in <hi>Holland,</hi> tho he had several Letters from <hi>Shepard,</hi> yet there was no satisfactory account, till some time after the Deponent parted from the Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> and was making for a Ship at <hi>Rotterdam</hi> to transport himself to <hi>England. Iames Steuart</hi> wrot to him that there was hopes of the Money. The next day after the Deponent came to <hi>England,</hi> he met with Sir <hi>Iohn Cochran,</hi> who, with Commissar <hi>Monro,</hi> and <hi>Ierviswood,</hi> was at <hi>London</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he came over; and depons, that he knows not the account of their coming, more then for the perfecting the Transaction about <hi>Carolina</hi>: and having acquainted Sir <hi>Iohn Cochran</hi> with the Earls demands of the 30000 pound <hi>Sterling</hi> and the 1000. Horse and Dragoons, Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> carried him to the Lord <hi>Russel,</hi> to whom the Deponent proposed the affair, but being an absolute Stranger to the Deponent, had no return from him at that time; but afterwards having met him accidently at Mr. <hi>Shepards</hi> ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>se, where he the Lord <hi>Russel</hi> had come to speak to <hi>Shepard</hi> about the Money above-named, as Mr. <hi>Shepard</hi> told the Deponent. The Deponent (when they were done speaking) desired to speak to the Lord <hi>Russel,</hi> which the Lord <hi>Russel</hi> did, and having reiterate the former Proposition for 30000. pound <hi>Sterling,</hi> and the 1000. Horse and Dragoons, he the Lord <hi>Russel</hi> told the Deponent, they could not get so much raised at the time, but if they had 10000. pound to begin, that would draw People in, and when they were once in, they would soon be brought to more; but as for the 1000. Horse and Dragoons, he could say nothing at the present, for that behoved to be concerted upon the Borders. The Deponent made the same proposal to Mr. <hi>Ferguson,</hi> who was much concerned in the Affair, and zealous for the promoving of it. This Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi> had in <hi>October</hi> or <hi>November</hi> before, as the Deponent remembers in a Conversation with the Deponent in <hi>Cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,</hi> or the Street somewhere thereabout, said, that for the saving of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Blood, it would be necessary to cut off a few, insinuating the King and Duke, but cannot be positive whether he named them or not, to which the Deponent said, that's work for our wild People in <hi>Scotland,</hi> my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science does not serve me for such things; after which the Deponent had never any particular discourse with <hi>Ferguson,</hi> as to that matter; but as to the other Affair, <hi>Ferguson</hi> told the Deponent that he was doing what he could to get it effectuate, as particularly that he spoke to one Major <hi>Wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> who is not of the Deponent his acquaintance. <hi>Ferguson</hi> blamed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <hi>Sidney,</hi> as driving designs of his own. The Deponent met twice or thrice with the Lord <hi>Melvil,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Cochran, Ierviswood,</hi> Commissar <hi>Monro,</hi> the two <hi>Cessnocks, Mongomery</hi> of <hi>Landshaw,</hi> and one Mr. <hi>Veitch,</hi> where they discoursed of Money to be sent to <hi>Argyle,</hi> in order to the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:55475:32"/>
on the Affair, and tho he cannot be positive the Affair was named, yet it was understood by himself, and as he conceives by all present, to be for rising in Arms, for rectifying the Government. Commissary <hi>Monro,</hi> Lord <hi>Melvil,</hi> and the two <hi>Cessnocks</hi> were against medling with the <hi>English,</hi> because they judged them men that would talk, and would not do, but were more inclined to do something by themselves, if it could be done. The Lord <hi>Melvil</hi> thought every thing hazardous, and therefore the Deponent cannot say he was positive in any thing, but was most inclined to have the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> to head them in <hi>Scotland,</hi> of which no particular me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod was laid down. <hi>Ierviswood,</hi> the Deponent, and Mr. <hi>Veitch,</hi> were for taking Money at one of these Meetings. It was resolved, that Mr. <hi>Martin,</hi> late Clerk to the Justice Court should be sent to <hi>Scotland,</hi> to desire their Friends to hinder the Countrey from Rising, or taking rash Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon the account of the Council, till they should see how matters went in <hi>England.</hi> The said <hi>Martin</hi> did go at the Charges of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Meeting, and was directed to the Laird of <hi>Polwart</hi> and <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woodlie,</hi> who sent back word that it would not be found so easie a matter to get the Gentrie of <hi>Scotland</hi> to concur: But afterwards in a Letter to Commissar <hi>Monro, Polwart</hi> wrote that the Countrey was readier to concur then they had imagined, or something to that purpose. The Deponent, as above-said, having brought over a Key from <hi>Holland,</hi> to serve himself and Major <hi>Holms</hi>: he remembers not that ever he had an axact Copy of it, but that sometimes the one, sometimes the other keeped it, and so it chanced to be in his custody when a Letter from the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> came to Major <hi>Holms,</hi> intimating, that he would joyn with the Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> and follow his measures, or obey his Directions. This Mr. <hi>Veitch</hi> thought fit to communicate to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and for the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of it was brought to the Deponent, and he gave the Key to Mr. <hi>Veitch,</hi> who as the Deponent, was informed, was to give it and the Letter to Mr. <hi>Ferguson,</hi> and he to shew it to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>; but what was done in it, the Deponent knows not. The Deponent heard the Design of Killing the King and Duke, from Mr. <hi>Shepard,</hi> who told the Deponent some were full upon it. The Deponent heard that <hi>Aron Smith</hi> was sent by those in <hi>England</hi> to call Sir <hi>Iohn Cochran,</hi> on the account of <hi>Carolina,</hi> but that he does not know <hi>Aron Smith,</hi> nor any more of that matter, not being concerned it it. <hi>Shepard</hi> named young <hi>Hamden</hi> frequently as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in these Matters.</p>

                              <p>YOu have now a Conspiracy against His <hi>Majesties</hi> Sacred Person, and Royal Government, so fully discover'd, that they must want Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son as well as Loyalty, who do not believe the Discovery; and they must be enemies to sincerity, as well as to the King, who do not acknowledge it. Beside, that the Councils of all the three Nations, thought the proof sufficient, for Indicting a General Thanksgiving through all these Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and that the Judges of <hi>England</hi> thought the same strong enough to infer Forefaulture of Life and Estate, against some of all Ranks there; you have a Discovery made here from the Late E. of <hi>Argiles</hi> own Letters, and the Confession of his own Emissaries, the two surest proofs that Law ever invented, or the nature of Humane Affairs can allow; and I am this day to add to all this, a new S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap>rt of Proofs in the Process that I now lead against this Pannal, from the Confessions of Noblemen and Gentlemen, who have been engaged in this wicked Conspiracy; and who from a sense of their Guilt, are content freely to Depose against their nearest Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and their most intimate Friend, in which having thus cleared to you, that there was really such a Conspiracy, I shall, in the next place, proceed to prove this Pannals Accession to it.</p>
                              <p>It cannot be imagined, that we would willingly involve our Countrey men in it, without a Conviction stronger then our kindness to <hi>Scotland</hi>; nor did His <hi>Majesties</hi> Servants accuse this Pannal, without the opinion of the ablest Lawyers of the Kingdom, who did, with them concur, to think that there was not the least occasion of doubting left, to the most indifferent Inqueist of his guilt, after they had seriously, and with reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, read over, and pondered the probation now laid before you.</p>
                              <p>The Person accused of accession to this Cryme is the Ring-leader of all those, who in this Kingdom concurr'd with the <hi>English</hi> Conspirators, as you may see by the Testimonies of all who have Deposed; and it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed fit and just to begin with the most guilty, so that if he be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed, there should no man be punished for this Conspiracie; all the noise we have heard of it, is but a Cheat, the Kings Judges have been Murderers, all the Witnesses have been Knaves, and such as dyed for it have been Martyrs.</p>
                              <p>The Accession charged on the Pannal, is not an accidental escape, nor is it proved by Witnesses, who can be suspected of unkindnes to his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, or his Cause, for it is a long tract of a continued design, gone about with the greatest deliberation and concern imaginable, and proved by his nearest Relations, and persons so deeply engadged in that Cause, (for which he Suffers,) that they were content with him to venture their Lives and Fortunes in that quarrel. He is not accused of a Crime that can amount only to a single Murder, though that be a dreadful Cryme, but a Rebellion, which was to draw upon us a Civil War, that Murder of Murders, in which hundreths of thousands were to fall; and to Crown all, he was to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:55475:34"/>
first steps was to kill His Sacred <hi>Majestie,</hi> and his Royal Brother; and one of the chief Witnesses which I have led against him, is <hi>Bourn,</hi> which <hi>Bourn</hi> confessed that he was to kill the King, and who confesses the Pannal sat up several nights with <hi>Ferguson,</hi> the other contriver of the Kings Murder, and so familiar was he with him, that <hi>Bourn</hi> depons, that the said Pannal had been with <hi>Ferguson,</hi> at the drawing of the <hi>manifesto,</hi> whereby he was not only to be an Actor, but to be the Justifier of that horrid Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanie: and therefore <hi>Bourns</hi> depons, that <hi>Ferguson,</hi> (the best Judge in that case) looked upon him as the chief man, next to <hi>Argyle</hi>; But because no man is presumed to go to such a hight, without previous inclination and motives, I shall to convince you, that this Gentleman was very capable of all that was lybelled against him, remember you, that he is Nephew, and Son in Law to the late <hi>Waristoun,</hi> bred up in his Family and under his Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory; about the time of this Plot it was undenyably known, and is now suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently proved, by two present Witnesses, the Earl of <hi>Tarras</hi> and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missar <hi>Monro,</hi> that he thought himself desperat, knowing himself to be guilty of Treason by <hi>Blackwoods</hi> Case; and as it's presumable, that a man that's guilty of one point of Treason, will commit another; so when a man is desperat as to his Life and Fortune, he is capable of any thing; he was likewise animated to commit this Cryme, by the intelligence he had that there was a Plot in <hi>England,</hi> carryed on by men of so great Parts, Fortune and Influence, and by the too probable hopes, that they would get all the Western Shires to joyn with them here, because of the common guilt, in which they had engadged themselves, by their late extravagances, they made an account of an assistance of twenty thousand men; and by <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liphaughs</hi> Deposition, that these Gentlemen expected the concurse of the Southern-Shires; and thus, I am to prove to you a Cryme, which is in it self, so probable and liklie, that it should need little probation, tho I have adduced for your conviction sufficient evidences, albeit the Cryme were in it self very unliklie.</p>
                              <p>The Crymes which I hope I have proved, are, That <hi>Ierviswood</hi> the Pannal transacted for Money to the late Earl of <hi>Argyl,</hi> a declared Traitor. 2. That he designed to raise a Rebellion. 3. That he intercommuned with the Earl of <hi>Argyl</hi> and Mr. <hi>Veitch</hi> declared Traitors. 4.

                              <p>That <hi>Ierviswood</hi> was designing to carry on a Rebellion, or at least was accessory, or (as our Law terms it) was <hi>Art and Part</hi> thereof, is clearly prov'd; but that in this occult and hidden Crime, which uses not to be prov'd by clear witnesses; I may lead you thorow all the steps of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, which like the links of a Chain, hang upon one another. You will be pleased to consider, that 1. It is proved that he desired a blind Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to go to <hi>England,</hi> not to manage the affairs of the <hi>Carolina</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, as he confess'd, <hi>but to push the People of</hi> England <hi>to do something for themselves, because they did only talk and not do</hi>; and what he would have them to do, appears too clearly, because he tells the Earl of <hi>Tarras</hi> it was
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:55475:34"/>
probable, <hi>that if the King were briskly put to it by the Parliament of</hi> England, <hi>he would consent to exclude the Duke from the Succession</hi>: here is not only a Treasonable Design, (though a design be sufficient in Treason) but here are express acts of Treason proved, <hi>viz.</hi> The treating with the Earl of <hi>Tarras</hi> upon this design, the settling a Correspondence with him for the prosecution of it, and the writing Letters from <hi>London</hi> to him concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and the sending down Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> to compleat it by a general <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                                 <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing; As he design'd to push on the <hi>English,</hi> so he prosecutes closely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                                 </gap> Design upon all occasions. On the Road he complains cunningly and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly, that our Lives, Laws and Liberties, and the Protestant Religon were in danger, the stile and method of all such as design to Rebel; after he arrives at <hi>London,</hi> he engages the Conspirators there to assist the late Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi> a declar'd Traitor, with Money to buy Arms; this was indeed to push the <hi>English</hi> to do the most dangerous things by the most dangerous man, and in the most dangerous methods. He enters also in a strict Correspondence with <hi>Ferguson</hi> the Contriver, with <hi>Shepard</hi> the Thesaurer, and <hi>Carstares</hi> the Chaplain of the Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Alexander Monro</hi> another present Witness, proves that he argued with him, that it was necessary to give <hi>Argile</hi> Money expressly for carrying on the Rebellion, and that they did meet at <hi>Ierviswoods</hi> Chamber where this was spoke of, and from which Mr. <hi>Robert Martin</hi> was sent to their Friends in <hi>Scotland</hi> to know what they would do; and though the silly caution was, that they sent him to prevent their rising, yet a man must renounce common sense, not to see that the design was to incite them to Rebellion, and to prevent only their doing any thing in this rebellious design, by which they might lose themselves in a too early and abortive Insurrection here, till things were ready in <hi>England.</hi> For, 1. This Commission was given him in a place, and by a Company who had been themselves treating immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly before of sending Money to the late E. of <hi>Argile</hi> to buy Arms, and certainly those Arms were to be bought for Men, and not for a Magazine. 2. They were treating how many Men could be raised in <hi>Scotland.</hi> 3. <hi>Carstares</hi> Deposition bears, that <hi>Martin</hi> was sent to hinder rash Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, till they saw how Matters went in <hi>England,</hi> and the return to their Embassy bore, that it would not be an easie matter to get the Gentry of <hi>Scotland</hi> to concur; but afterwards better hopes of their rising was given, which could not have been, if the true Commission had not been to raise <hi>Scotland.</hi> 4. That Sir <hi>Iohn Cochran</hi> made a Speech to that purpose, is expressly prov'd, and that <hi>Ierviswood</hi> spoke to the same purpose, is prov'd by a necessary consequence; for since it's prov'd that he spoke, and that he did not speak against it, it must necessarily follow that he spoke for it, though the Witness is so cautious, that he cannot condescend upon the words now after so long a time; and it is against Sense to think, that <hi>Ier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viswood</hi> who in privat press'd the same so much upon Commissar <hi>Monro,</hi> and who was the Deacon-Conveener here, and who, as Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> their Envoy declared, was the person who was to be sent for the Arms, should not himself have been the most forward man in that Design, but above all <hi>exitus acta probat,</hi> this Commissioner, (who being a meer Servant, durst not have proposed any thing from himself, being a mean Person, and being one, who, as the Earl of <hi>Tarras</hi> deposes, would say nothing, but what was in his Paper:) does expresly declare, that he came from <hi>Ierviswood</hi> and others; and in the meeting with him, a Rebellion is actually formed, and it is resolved, they should seize the King's Officers of State, Garisons, and Forces, and that they should joyn with the late E. of <hi>Argyle,</hi> and put their own Forces in a condition to joyn with these Forces that were to come from <hi>England,</hi> and they gave a Sign, and a Word, which uses only to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:55475:35"/>
be done in actual War; So here is Treason clearly prov'd, by two pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Witnesses, from the first Design to it's last perfection.</p>
                              <p>Nor can it be objected, that they are not concurring Witnesses, but <hi>testes singulares</hi> upon separat Acts, for in reiterable Crimes, Witnesses deposing upon different Acts; do prove if the deeds tend to the same end; as for instance, if one Witnes should depose, that they saw a Traitor sit in a Council of War, in one place, and in another place, they saw him in Arms, or that one saw him assist at a Proclamation in one place, and saw him in Arms in another; or that one saw him writ a Treasonable Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and another saw him use it; These Witnesses are still considered as contestes, or concurring Witnesses, and ten or twelve Inqueists have so found, and upon their Verdict, Rebells have been lately hang'd. The learn'd Judges of <hi>England</hi> being all met together did expresly find, that one Witnes proving, that A. B. said, that he was going to buy a Knife to kill the King, and another deposing, that he saw him buy a Knife, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out telling for what, that these two Witnesses were contestes, and prov'd sufficiently the Cryme of Treason, yet there the one Witnes, prov'd only a remote Design, and the other an Act, which was indifferent of it's own nature, and became only Treasonable by the Connexion; But no Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses ever Deposed upon things so coherent, and so connected together, as these do, for they depose still upon the same person, carrying on the same Design of a Rebellion; as to which, in one place, he is exciting his own Nephew, and telling him his Resolutions, and settling a Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with him, at another time, he presses Commissar <hi>Monro</hi> to the same Rebellion. At a third, He holds a meeting at his own Chamber, and speaks concerning it, and from that meeting, he sends a Trusty, who formes the Rebellion. Besides all this, tho two Witnesses be sufficient, I have adduced Mr. <hi>William Carstares</hi> Chief Conspirator, and who choos'd rather to suffer violent Torture, than to disclose it, he likewise Deposes upon all these steps, and connects them together, and this his Deposition is twice reiterated, upon Oath, after much premeditation. And I like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise adduce two Depositions taken upon Oath, by Sir <hi>Leolin Ienkins,</hi> who was impower'd by the Law of <hi>England,</hi> and at the command of the King, and the Council of <hi>England,</hi> upon a Letter from His <hi>Majesties</hi> Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of State here, In which Deposition, <hi>Shepard,</hi> one of the Witnesses, deposes, that <hi>Baillie</hi> came frequently to him, and desired him to advance the Money, <hi>and lamented the delays,</hi> and that there was so little to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced; and who should be better believed then one who was his own Trustie, and a Person who was able to advance so great a Sum; <hi>Bourn,</hi> another of the Witnesses, Deposes, that <hi>Ferguson</hi> told him, that the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal spoke frequently to him concerning the same Money, and that he sat up several nights with <hi>Ferguson</hi> upon the said Conspiracy; and who should be better believed then <hi>Fergusons</hi> confident, and one who was so far trusted in the whole affair, that he was to take away that Sacred Life, which Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven has preserv'd by so many Miracles.</p>
                              <p>Against these three Depositions, you have heard it objected, that <hi>non testimonia sed testes probant,</hi> especially by our Law, in which, by an express Act of Parliament, no Probation is to be led, but in presence of the Assise and Pannal. To which it is answered, that these Depositions are not meer Testimonies; for I call a Testimony, a voluntar Declaration, emitted without an Oath, and a Judge; but these Depositions are taken under the awe of an Oath, and by the direction of a Judge. 2. <hi>Shepard</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted with the Pannal himself, and he had nothing to say against him; whereas the great thing that can be objected against Testimonies (and by our Statute especially) is that if the Party who emits the Testimony had
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:55475:35"/>
been confronted with the Pannal; the impression of seeing a person that was to die, by his Deposition, would have made him afraid to Depose laxly; and the Pannal likewise might, by proposing Interrogators and Questions, have cleared himself, and satisfi'd the Judges in many things Depos'd against him: But so it is that Mr. <hi>Shepard</hi> having been confron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Pannal, before the King Himself, who is as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                                 </gap>ar above other Judges, in His Reason and Justice, as He is in His Power and Authority; He Deposes that the Pannal was the chief Mannager of this Conspiracy, next to <hi>Argile,</hi> and that he was so passionate to have this Money to buy Arms, that he lamented the delays; and can it be imagined that Mr. <hi>Shepard</hi> whom he trusted with his Life and his Fortune, and whom all their Party trusted with their Cash, would have Depos'd any thing against him that was not true, especially when he knew that what he was to Depose, was to take away his Life and his Fortune; or that if the Pannal had been innocent, he would not when he was confronted with Mr. <hi>Shepard,</hi> before the King Himself, have roar'd against Mr. <hi>Shepard,</hi> if he had not been conscious to his own Guilt. There is a surprise in innocence, which makes the innocent exclaim, and it inspires men with a courage, which enables them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found those who Depose falsly against them; and in what occasion could either of these have appear'd, more than in this, wherein this Gentleman was charg'd to have Conspir'd with the greatest of Rascals, against the best of Princes; and that too in presence of the Prince himself, against whom he had Conspir'd; but Guilt stupifies indeed, and it did never more than in this Gentlemans Case, whose silence was a more convincing Witness than Mr. <hi>Shepard</hi> could be. Mr. <hi>Carstares</hi> likewise knew when he was to Depone, that his Deposition was to be used against <hi>Ierviswood,</hi> and he stood more in awe of his love to his Friend, than of the fear of the Torture, and hazarded rather to die for <hi>Ierviswood,</hi> than that <hi>Ierviswood</hi> should die by him: How can it then be imagin'd, that if this man had seen <hi>Ierviswood</hi> in his Tryal, it would have altered his Deposition; or that this kindness, which we all admir'd in him would have suffer'd him to forget any thing in his Deposition, which might have been advantageous in the least to his Friend: And they understand ill this hight of Friendship, who think that it would not have been more nice and careful, than any Advocate could have been: and if <hi>Carstares</hi> had forgot at one time, would he not have supplyed it at another; but especially at this last time, when he knew his Friend was already brought upon his Tryal: and that this renew'd Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony was yet a further confirmation of what was said against him; and albeit the Kings Servants were forced to engage, that <hi>Carstares</hi> himself should not be made use of as a Witness against <hi>Ierviswood</hi>; yet I think this kind scrupulosity in <hi>Carstares</hi> for <hi>Ierviswood,</hi> should convince you more than twenty suspect, nay than even indifferent Witnesses; nor can it be imagined, that the one of these Witnesses; would not have been as much afraid of God, and his Oath at <hi>London,</hi> as at <hi>Edinburgh</hi>; and the other in the Council Chamber in the Forenoon, as in the Justice-Court in the Afternoon.</p>
                              <p n="3">3. The Statute founded on, does not discharge the producing of Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies otherways than after the Jury is inclos'd; for then indeed they might be dangerous, because the party could not object against them: But since the Statute only discharges to produce Writ, or Witnesses, after the Jury is inclos'd; it seems clearly to insinuat, that they ought to prove when they are produc'd in presence of the Party himself, as now they are. And though the Civil Law did not allow their Judges to believe Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, because they were confin'd to observe strict Law; yet it does not from that follow, that our Juries, whom the Law allows to be a Law to themselves, and to be confin'd by no Rule, but their Conscience, may not trust intirely to the Depositions of Witnesses, though not taken before
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:55475:36"/>
themselves, when they know that the Witnesses, by whom, and the Judges, before whom these Depositions were emited, are persons beyond all suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as in our case. But yet for all this, I produce these Testimonies, as Adminicles here only to connect the Depositions of the present Witnesses, and not to be equivalent to Witnesses in this legal Process; albeit, as to the conviction of mankind, they are stronger than any ordinary Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</p>
                              <p>When you, my Lords and Gentlemen, remember that it is not the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge of a privat party, that accuses in this case; and that even in privat Crimes, such as Forgery, or the murder of Children, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> many Juries here have proceeded upon meer presumptions, and that even <hi>Solomon</hi> himself, founded his illustrious Decision, approv'd by God Almighty, upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd assertion of a mother; I hope ye will think two Friends Deposing, as present Witnesses, adminiculated and connected by the Depositions of others, though absent; should beget in you an intire belief, especially against a Pannal, who has been always known to incline this way, and who, though he was desired in the Tolbooth to vindicate himself from those Crimes, would not say any thing in his own defence, and though he offers to clear himself of his accession to the Kings murder, yet sayes nothing to clear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self from the Conspiracy entered into with the late Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi> for invading his Native Countrey, which is all that I here Charge upon him, and which he inclines to Justifie, as a necessary mean for redressing Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances; I must therefore remember you, that an Inquest of very worthy Gentlemen did find <hi>Rathillet</hi> guilty, tho there was but one Witness led a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, because when he was put to it, he did not deny his accession: And two Rogues were found guilty in the late Circuit at <hi>Glascow,</hi> for having murdered a Gentleman of the Guard, though no man saw them kill him; but the murderers having been pursued, they run to the place out of which the Pannals then accused were taken, none having seen the face of the Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aweys; and the Pannals being accus'd: and press'd to deny the accession, shun'd to disown the Guilt, but desired it might be proved against them. This may convince you that there are Proofs which are stronger then Witnesses; and I am sure that there were never more proving Witnesses then in this case, nor were the Depositions of Witnesses ever more strongly adminiculated. Remember the danger likewise of emboldening Conspiracies against the Kings Sacred Life, and of encouraging a Civil War, wherein your selves and your Posterity may bleed, by making the least difficulty to find a man Guilty by the strongest Proofs that ever were adduced in so latent a Crime as a Conspiracy is. And I do justly conclude, that whoever denys that a Conspiracy can be thus prov'd, does let all the World see that he inclines that Conspiracies should be encouraged and allow'd. Our Age is so far from needing such Encouragements, that on the other hand in this, as in all other Crimes, because the Guilt grows frequent and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, the Probation should therefore be made the more easie, tho in this Case the King needs as little desire your Favour, as fear your Justice. And I have insisted so much upon this Probation, rather to convince the World of the Conspiracy, than you that this Conspirator is Guilty.</p>
