            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The possession of <hi>Adam</hi> was much, to be an Emperour of the whole world, a commander of all the whole earth, but in the midst of this great blisse, the contempt of God and vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse to God ouerthrew <hi>Adam:</hi> for Satan taking vpon him the forme of a serpent, a murtherer from his originall, <note place="margin">Iohn 7.</note> and a lier from the beginning, the ancient enemie of Man, enuying the happy estate and the great felicitie of <hi>Adam,</hi> fell in friendship with <hi>Eue,</hi> entising her to eate of the forbidden fruite, saying: If thou eate of the tree of knowledge, your eies shall be open, you shall know both good and bad, and you shall bee as GOD himselfe. <hi>Eua</hi> streight conceiued by the wordes of the serpent the destruction of man, and was enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to say with the Poet, <hi>Vt vidi, vt perij, vt me malus abstulit error?</hi> tooke the fruite, ate it, and gaue it to <hi>Adam</hi> to eate.

            <p>This contempt of God through vnthankfulnesse, lost all the benefites of God which he gaue to man in his creation.

No doubt as soone as man was created, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan sought mans destruction, and had a wicked desire to hate him, he went with all his might to destroy man, and working errour and rebellion in our first parents <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue,</hi> hee slew all mankind.

And <hi>Beda</hi> our owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triman sayd, that <hi>Adam</hi> was formed the sixt day in which he sinned, and therefore died: for it was meete in reason, that the same day the second <hi>Adam</hi> for the saluation of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kind should sanctifie vnto himselfe his spouse the Church, in which he had created the first <hi>Adam</hi> the father of mankind, &amp; taking a ribbe out of his side, made a woman: for as man was formed the sixt day, and did eate of the tree the sixt houre, so the Lord Iesus reforming man, is fastened to the tree the sixt day, and sixt houre: and that day wherein Christ was kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and slaine in the flesh, and in the which day he was made a redeemer and a Sauiour to man that had perished, It is so euident that that day the Lord obeying his father, suffered death, wherein <hi>Adam</hi> being disobedient vnto God died: for as <hi>Adam</hi> by eating of the forbidden fruit of the tree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, brought death to the world, so Christ our Sauiour dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon the tree of the crosse, gaue life vnto man.

Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of these Analogies seeme probable for the confirming of these opinions afore spoken. For as it was kept in the tree which was the instrument of life and death, so is it also kept in time and place.

So was the promise of God before <hi>Adam</hi> was brought out of Paradise, that the seed of the woman (the Messias and Sauior in whom and by whom we haue eternall life) should tread the Serpents head. This comfort was very great vnto <hi>Adam,</hi> and continued from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> the first man vnto <hi>Abraham,</hi> 1949. yeeres, the first Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch, <note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> wherein the children of God were instructed by this promise, and saw through faith the redemption of man.</p>
            <p>Now by the sentence of God <hi>Adam</hi> was sent from the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of <hi>Eden</hi> to till the earth whence he was taken, and being cast out at the East side of the garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> the Lord God set Cherubins and the blade of a sword shaken, to keepe the way of the tree of life.

                  </note> his owne cause carefully: he appointed <hi>Ioab</hi> to be his Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.

ouerthrowing of his aduersaries. These warres continued long, for <hi>Abner</hi> made all his power for the house of <hi>Saul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But God wrought otherwise to bring his purpose to passe: while <hi>Saul</hi> liued, hee had a concubine named <hi>Rizpha,</hi> with whom <hi>Abner</hi> kept companie, and consumed more time with <hi>Rizpha</hi> then he did in the seruice of <hi>Ishboseth.</hi> The king being moued with some choler, charged <hi>Abner</hi> with his fault con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his fathers concubine: this checke could not be wel disgested of <hi>Abner,</hi> and therefore he communed with the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>Israel,</hi> and perswaded them to take <hi>Dauid</hi> for their king: and after that, <hi>Abner</hi> went to <hi>Hebron</hi> to <hi>Dauid,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised him that he would bring all <hi>Israel</hi> vnder his gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and all this <hi>Abner</hi> did rather for malice &amp; hatred that he bare to <hi>Ishboseth,</hi> then for any good will he bare to <hi>Dauid.</hi> Notwithstanding, <hi>Dauid</hi> accepted in good part his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to him, thogh <hi>Ioab</hi> would haue had the king to slay <hi>Abner</hi> for his priuate grudge, which was the killing of <hi>Asahel Ioabs</hi> bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which within a while after <hi>Ioab</hi> reuenged, for he killed <hi>Abner</hi> vnknowing to <hi>Dauid,</hi> whose deth <hi>Dauid</hi> lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted much. <note place="margin">Ioab <hi>killeth</hi> Abner.</note>

I will therefore set downe the continuance, the nombers of their kings, the change and varietie of this Kingdome: for after that <hi>Nimrod</hi> had drawen people together, he first laide the foundation of the Empire, made lawes, began to builde a great Citie, and named it <hi>Babylon,</hi> the first Citie after the flood: which Citie though <hi>Nimrod</hi> began it, his sonne <hi>Belus</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Melancthon lib. 1.</note> amplified it, and last of al <hi>Semiramis</hi> finished it in such forme and stately shewe, as he that is desirous to knowe the length, the breadth, the compasse, situation, the strength and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> let him read <hi>Herodotus Solinus,</hi> where it is largely <note place="margin">Herodot. lib. 1.</note> described.

               <p>But now <hi>Amasis</hi> raigned king in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and ruler of <hi>Apries</hi> throne: thus <hi>Apries</hi> after he had raigned thirtie fiue yeeres, died by the handes of his enemies. During the raignes of these two last kings <hi>Necho</hi> and <hi>Apries,</hi> which was fiftie three yeres, many destructions of countreys and cities happened, as the destruction of <hi>Niniue,</hi> and also <hi>Assyria</hi> by <hi>Ciaxeres</hi> king of the <hi>Medes,</hi> the destruction of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> and all <hi>Iudea</hi> by <hi>Nabuchodonosor</hi> king of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the warres betweene the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> which continued seuen and twentie yeeres, the victorie whereof fell to the king of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> as the Prophet before had sayde, <hi>I will giue the lande</hi>

This <hi>Amasias,</hi> as the rest of the kings before him, was so ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous, and so addicted to obey Oracles, that hee also imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated his predecessours in such fonde buildings, to carie huge stones from <hi>Memphis</hi> and from <hi>Elephantina</hi> to builde a temple vp vnto <hi>Minerua</hi> in the citie of <hi>Sai,</hi> that hee much mused how he might passe the rest with the monstrousnesse of the great huge stones to build temples, images, colossus: wherein he in one monument excelled the rest.</p>
               <p>He caused a house to be made of one stone to be brought <note place="margin">The kings of <hi>Egypt</hi> conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted one to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell another in building.</note> from the citie of <hi>Elephantina</hi> to the citie of <hi>Sais,</hi> which is (as <hi>Herodotus</hi> writeth) twentie dayes sayling: two thousand cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen men were three yeeres in bringing this house to <hi>Sai,</hi> of all other workes most to bee wondered: for this stone was one and twentie cubites in length, and fourteene in breadth: and also hee made a <hi>colossus</hi> or an image in <hi>Memphis,</hi> before the temple of <hi>Vulcan,</hi> of seuentie and fiue foote long: he buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded likewise a large temple for <hi>Isis</hi> in <hi>Memphis.</hi> Thus the kings of <hi>Egypt</hi> stroue one after another, to excell in their workes and vaine monuments.</p>
               <p>In the time of this king, a lawe was made in <hi>Egypt,</hi> that in euery Prouince of <hi>Egypt</hi> the President thereof should take <note place="margin">Idlenesse in <hi>Egypt</hi> pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.</note> accompt, and examine the youthes of their prouinces, how and after what sort they liued: for to see an idle man in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> that could not answere for himselfe howe hee liued, it was death: and therefore to auoyde idlenesse, they were thus compelled by the Kings of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to carie stones to the building of <hi>Piramides,</hi> temples, Colossus, Labirinthes, and such like.</p>
               <p>This law afterward was by <hi>Solon</hi> brought to <hi>Greece,</hi> for <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> was in <hi>Egypt</hi> in the time of the last <hi>Amasis.

and <hi>Thebes,</hi> which is reported to haue an 100. brasen gates, and so many princes pallaces.

               <p n="1">1. The first law was, that none might violate their gods with othes: the offenders herein were punished as false to God and man.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If any ayded not a man iniuried or beaten, or robbed by any man, either vpon the way as he trauailed, or in the place where he dwelt, he was to die for it, if he might haue helped it: else to publish, and to call for helpe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. False witnes was so punished, by a decree made for that purpose: the punishment that hee that was accused should haue, being proued, should be for the false accuser not being proued.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Against idlenes, all the names of the citie, parish, or countrey, are brought and recorded with the magistrates of the prouinces, &amp; are examined, how they are occupied, how they liue, of what trade or trafique he or they be of: if he be found idle, he shall die by the lawe in <hi>Egypt:</hi> this law <hi>Solon</hi> caried with him from <hi>Egypt</hi> to <hi>Athens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. If any man killed a freeman, or a seruant, death was his punishment.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If the father killed the sonne, he was free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death, but he should for three dayes be punished as the decree was made in that behalfe: for the <hi>Egyptians</hi> thought not the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther worthy of death for killing of his so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, <hi>quia auctor fuit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. For the sonne that killed his father, the greatest tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that might be deuised was by lawe appointed for him, for to take the life of him away, which gaue him life.</p>
               <p n="8">8. If a woman with child, by law be condemned to die, she is reserued vntill the childe be borne: for the <hi>Egyptians</hi> thinke it not fit that two should be punished, when one
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:9229:93" rendition="simple:additions"/>
had offended, and that the giltlesse with the giltie should be condemned: <hi>Iniquum enim iustum cum iniusto poenam pati.</hi> This law was caried from <hi>Egypt</hi> into <hi>Greece,</hi> &amp; from <hi>Greece</hi> into other countreis.</p>
               <p n="9">9 The souldier that offended his captaine in the fielde, or had transgressed the commandement of the officers, he should not die, but with all infamie and shame he should haue two letters printed in his forehead, as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon markes of infamie: but if hee had reuealed any secrets to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, the lawe had commaunded his tongue to be pluckt out of his head.</p>
               <p n="10">10 If any had clipt any lawfull coine, or counterfaited the like, or diminished the weight, by lawe he should die.</p>
               <p n="11">11 If any man had counterfaited the hand of any man, or had taken away any letters, or had put in any letters in any writings, or found faultie in forging any deede or letters, he should haue both his hands cut off.</p>
               <p n="12">12 If any had violated by force any maid or free woman, he should haue that member punished that had offended, his priuie members cut off: if by consent the man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man sinned, it was by lawe appointed that the man should be beaten with roddes to the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of a thousand stripes, and the woman should haue her nose cut off, for a marke of a whore.</p>
               <p n="13">13 For satisfiyng of creditors in borowing of money, it was by an othe confirmed, &amp; not with obligations made, that the money shoulde be paide vpon the day appointed: for a sacred othe sincerely inuiolated, was more esteemed in <hi>Egypt,</hi> then any writing or bond made: for it was a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to see in <hi>Egypt</hi> a man forsworne.</p>
               <p n="14">14 For it was not lawfull to arrest any man in <hi>Egypt</hi> for debtes by the lawe of <hi>Bochoris,</hi> but to seize vpon the goods or substance: for whatsoeuer passed in secrete wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings betweene the partie and creditour, no arrest was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted:
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:9229:94"/>
for all the people of <hi>Egypt</hi> were diuided into foure <note place="margin">Bochoris lawes.</note> partes, which were husbandmen, craftesmen, shepheards, and souldiers: payment was made to the creditors by the goods of the debtors, and not by arrest: for they thought that a man free borne, shoulde for no money be impriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, specially the souldiers, which with danger of life de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth his countrey.</p>
               <p n="15">15 The like law was in <hi>Egypt</hi> for vsurie by <hi>Bochoris,</hi> which <note place="margin">A lawe for vsurie.</note> was brought to <hi>Athens</hi> by <hi>Solon,</hi> which lawe was called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: by this lawe <hi>Solon</hi> commaunded that no Citizen in <hi>Athens</hi> should be put in prison for vsurie: for the <hi>Egyptians</hi> condemned much the <hi>Grecians</hi> that had by the law forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to arrest any plough, harneis, and such necessaries for the vse of man, and yet a man that vsed these, and coulde make these, suffered to be arrested and to be imprisoned.</p>
               <p n="16">16 The law against theft in <hi>Egypt</hi> was, that he that would <note place="margin">A law against theft.</note> steale, shoulde write his name, and recorde it in a booke which the chiefe captaine, or the great prince appointed: for those shoulde receiue the theft, and the partie that had lost his goodes, should come to his captaine, and shoulde set downe the day and the houre wherein his goods were lost, and the captaine shoulde recorde it in his booke, and appoint him a day to come againe: against the which day the theft being found out, hee should haue all his losse sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the fourth part, which by law the theefe had: for they so iudged it better, sithence it were vnpossible to forbidde theft, or to hang as many as would steale.</p>
               <p n="17">17 As for the law for mariage, it was thus: that the priests of <hi>Egypt</hi> might mary but one wife a piece: others as many <note place="margin">A lawe for mariage.</note> as pleased them: for that they would haue their countrey populous, &amp; their cities strong with people: no bastardes might bee named in <hi>Egypt,</hi> though diuers were borne of bondwomen, esteeming onely their fathers for credit, and the mothers for their nources. Nowe for their Iudges and
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:9229:94" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Magistrates that executed these lawes in <hi>Egypt,</hi> they were elected by 30. of the best and wisest men in euery great ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as <hi>Memphis, Heliopolis, Thebes,</hi> and the rest, in euery ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie one chiefe Iudge with his sociates with him, as were the <hi>Areopagites</hi> in <hi>Athens,</hi> or the <hi>Ephories</hi> in <hi>Sparta.</hi> Of other lawes concerning the religions of their gods, &amp; their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials, and of their discipline and order in warres, I haue written of it in the Diall of dayes.</p>
               <p>There was also a lawe in <hi>Egypt</hi> before these lawes, that the <note place="margin">Diodo. lib. 2. cap. 3.</note> pictures and images of their gods painted in tables and set in brasse in their Temples, should be caried in their ensigns to the field in the time of warres.</p>
               <p>But as <hi>Egypt</hi> florished in the time of king <hi>Amasis,</hi> so <hi>Egypt</hi> was brought subiect vnto the <hi>Persians</hi> within sixe dayes after <note place="margin">

                  <hi>Amasis</hi> dayes: for after that <hi>Amasis</hi> had reigned fourtie foure yeeres, his sonne succeeded him called <hi>Psammenitus,</hi> who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had reigned sixe yeeres, was ouerthrowen by <hi>Camby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Psammenitus.</note> king of <hi>Persia,</hi> which came from <hi>Persia</hi> into <hi>Egypt,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge the wrong which hee receiued at <hi>Amasis</hi> hand, who refused to giue his owne daughter in mariage to the king of of <hi>Persia,</hi> but deceiued him with a daughter of <hi>Apries</hi> called <hi>Nytetis,</hi> which was onely left aliue of all the stocke of <hi>Apries:</hi> whom <hi>Cambyses</hi> maried, supposing her to bee king <hi>Amasis</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Herodot. lib. 3.</note> daughter, vntill <hi>Apries</hi> daughter opened the whole matter, affirming vnto the king, howe <hi>Amasis</hi> had betrayed her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the king being his master, and by that reason had obteined the kingdome of <hi>Egypt:</hi> and also shee reuealed, howe he disdained to giue his owne daughter, but tooke me vp being left desolate and comfortlesse, and willed mee to <note place="margin">Cambyses.</note> faine my selfe to bee his daughter. These floutes and scoffes of <hi>Amasis,</hi> kindled wrath in <hi>Cambyses</hi> to come in armes into <hi>Egypt,</hi> but before he came, <hi>Amasis</hi> died.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding after he had conquered his sonne <hi>Psam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menitus,</hi> and had possessed the kingdome of <hi>Egypt,</hi> hee went from <hi>Memphis</hi> vnto <hi>Sai,</hi> to satisfie his wrath vpon <hi>Amasis:</hi> and

though he was before buried, yet hee caused his carcas to be brought before him, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded it first to be whipt and <note place="margin">The crueltie of <hi>Cambyses.</hi>

               <p>After <hi>Phiscon</hi> was banished, raigned his brother <hi>Ptolomey</hi> sirnamed <hi>Alexander,</hi> as <hi>Melancthon</hi> saith: but <hi>Alexander</hi> raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not long, but was likewise banished as his brother was.

            <p>I will therefore but touch the historie of <hi>Saracens,</hi> for that they were alwayes people scattered into all <hi>Asia,</hi> and from thence to all parts of the world, much like to the <hi>Scythians,</hi> who in like maner russhed into all partes, and inuaded all countreys, being rude and barbarous nations, praying vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on euery place they came into.

               <hi>Arabia,</hi> and the great Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> beganne at one times as two tyrants to persecute the Christians.

Caelius, Egnatius, Blo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dus</hi> and others, I will set downe as in a table some fewe of these <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens Amiras,</hi> for that they followed the <hi>Persian</hi> historie, whom they the fourth time haue conquered, as before is written, first by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> the second time by <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, the thirde by <hi>Alexander Seuerus</hi> being long before by the <hi>Romanes</hi> kept vnder, and now the fourth time by <hi>Haumar</hi> the third <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miras</hi> of the <hi>Saracens:</hi> and so the <hi>Persians</hi> endured the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, vntil the time of <hi>Sophi</hi> came, who gaue diuers repulses to the <hi>Turkes,</hi> and to the late <hi>Egyptians</hi> called <hi>Soldani,</hi> reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered <hi>Persia,</hi> that now againe <hi>Persia</hi> is very populous, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited, and strongly defended by the <hi>Sophie,</hi> which is now the generall name of all their kings.</p>
            <p>But to returne to <hi>Habdimelech</hi> the ninth <hi>Amiras,</hi> who had <note place="margin">Habdimelech <hi>the</hi> 9.

            <p>
               <hi>Zulzimin</hi> the eleuenth <hi>Amiras</hi> folowed: he raigned three yeeres: during which time <hi>Haumar</hi> the second of that name, <note place="margin">11 Zulzimin.</note> and the 12. <hi>Amiras</hi> that succeeded after <hi>Zulzimin,</hi> subdued <hi>Cilicia,</hi> and <hi>Masalmas</hi> another prince of the <hi>Saracens,</hi> inuaded <hi>Asia,</hi> tooke the citie of <hi>Pergamum,</hi> layde siege to <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> which siege endured three yeeres, at what time <hi>Zulzimin</hi> died, &amp; <hi>Haumar</hi> the second that succeeded him, raigned two <note place="margin">12</note> yeeres after him, who was glad to haue escaped the great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, cold and plague, which then raigned among his armie during the siege of <hi>Constantinople:</hi> beside his whole nauie vpon the sea were burnt vp with wilde fire, and monstrous great hailestones: this <hi>Haumar</hi> persecuted the Christians most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely.</p>

               <hi>Gizid</hi> the second of that name &amp; the 13. <hi>Amiras,</hi> succeeded <hi>Haumar</hi> and raigned 4. yeres: this was by a <hi>Iewe</hi> perswaded to <note place="margin">13 Gizid.</note> destroy images.

Now the cities of <hi>Greece</hi> being full of ciuil warres, some of them made meanes to <hi>Philip</hi> to ayde them, and thereby ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted him their chiefe generall: in short time the occasion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus offered to <hi>Philip,</hi> he encreased his owne kingdome of <hi>Macedonia</hi> with the ruine of <hi>Greece:</hi> for first he beganne to <note place="margin">

               <p>This <hi>Perseus</hi> succeeded <hi>Philip</hi> his father, found the strength of his kingdome so great and so well prouided, that hee had <note place="margin">The rich state of <hi>Perseus</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Philip his father.</note> in his armorie to arme thirtie thousand: he had in his fortes and strong places eight million bushels of corne safely lockt vp, and hee had ready as much money as would serue to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terteine tenne thousand strangers in paye for tenne yeeres: this also he found ready men leauied a great number, which his father had prepared for the second warres of <hi>Macedonia.

Now I haue in hand to speake of <hi>Seleucus</hi> the great king af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Alexander</hi> for after <hi>Antigonus</hi> was slaine, and his sonne <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Seleucus.</note> dead being taken captiue by <hi>Seleucus,</hi> he entred into <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia</hi> and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quered from mount <hi>Taurus</hi> into <hi>Ionia,</hi> which before <hi>Antigonus</hi> had vnder his gouernment, and had subdued all the regions of the greater <hi>Asia,</hi> and made himselfe mightie and <note place="margin">Diod. lib. 19.</note> great, which was in the 14. yeere after <hi>Alexanders</hi> death. The <hi>Iewes</hi> doe accompt the gouernment of the <hi>Grecians</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> from the first yeere of <hi>Seleucus Nicanors</hi> raigne, which in the <hi>Machabees</hi> is obserued.</p>
            <p>This king grew so great, that hauing subdued all <hi>Antigonus</hi> kingdomes, and hauing giuen <hi>Lysimachus</hi> the ouerthrow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the age of 77. yeeres, he thought no lesse in his minde after such great victories, but to become another <hi>Alexander,</hi> and to bring all the worlde vnder his gouernment: for hee ouercame the <hi>Bactrians,</hi> and passed to the <hi>Indians,</hi> hauing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie vnder his Scepter all <hi>Asia, Persia, Syria, Babylon,</hi> with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers others. Of this <hi>Seleucus Iustine</hi> writeth a strange historie, how his mother <hi>Laodice</hi> being maried to <hi>Antiochus,</hi> seemed in <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Laodices</hi> dreame.</note> a dreame to haue layen with <hi>Apollo,</hi> and to bee by him with childe: and of a ring, which <hi>Laodice</hi> dreamed to haue of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo,</hi> in the stone of the same ring was an Ancre imprinted, which afterward was the cognizance of all <hi>Seleucus</hi> posteritie. This ring did <hi>Laodice</hi> deliuer to her sonne <hi>Seleucus,</hi> at that <note place="margin">Iustin. lib. 15.</note> time when great <hi>Alexander</hi> tooke his conquest to <hi>Persia,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whom <hi>Seleucus</hi> was then a souldier: for hee was but base borne, as in that historie ye may reade further: yet this <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leucus</hi> after that <hi>Alexander</hi> died, had growen to be the onely great king of all <hi>Alexanders</hi> successours, and builded a great citie, and named it <hi>Antiochia</hi> after his fathers name, which was <hi>Antiochus</hi> a captaine vnder king <hi>Philip Alexanders</hi> father.</p>
            <p>The elder that <hi>Seleucus</hi> waxed, the more ambitious hee was: euen so was <hi>Lysimachus</hi> as olde as hee, the one seuentie <note place="margin">Ambition is dangerous.</note> and foure, and the other seuentie and seuen, and yet both gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to seeke more kingdomes: and at last seeking one to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer the other, (as it came to passe after many battels) <hi>Lysi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus</hi>
               <pb n="415" facs="tcp:9229:219" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was ouerthrowen and slaine by <hi>Seleucus.</hi> Of this great victorie he waxed so proude, that he forgate the fraile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of fortune, and the inconstancie of time, not thinking that his death should be within seuen moneths after: for <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomeus</hi> sirnamed <hi>Cerainon,</hi> whose sister <hi>Lysimachus</hi> had maried, reuenged the death of his brother in lawe. This battell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>Lysimachus</hi> and <hi>Seleucus</hi> was the last battell of all those that serued <hi>Alexander</hi> in his conquest: for as <hi>Lysimachus</hi> ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> so <hi>Seleucus</hi> ouerthrew <hi>Lysimachus,</hi> and now <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomeus</hi>

                  <hi>Seleucus</hi> slaine.</note> ouerthrew <hi>Seleucus,</hi> and that (as I said before) within seuen moneths after <hi>Lysimachus</hi> ouerthrow. But <hi>Iustine</hi> saith <hi>Seleucus</hi> was slaine by snares and falshood.</p>
            <p>By this time died the most part of those that were <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>

in gluttonie and riot: for he had at one time set before him two thousand fishes, and seuen thousand birds, besides other charges and expences. These wickednesses and vices cannot long endure in any man, much lesse in Princes. Hee had not raigned but 8. moneths, but hee was slaine by the captaine of <hi>Vespasian,</hi> for that <hi>Vitellius</hi> had slaine first <hi>Sabinus Vespasians</hi> brother, whom he burned in the <hi>Capitol</hi> which hee set on fire. <note place="margin">Sabinus Vespa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians <hi>brother slaine by</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellius.</note> But <hi>Vitellius</hi> had a reprochfull death for it: for as hee liued like <hi>Nero,</hi> so hee died like as <hi>Nero</hi> should haue died if hee had not killed himselfe. <hi>Vitellius</hi> was drawen naked through the citie of <hi>Rome</hi> along openly, with a sworde naked set vnder <note place="margin">

               <p>This Emperour was most gentle and courteous, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haued himselfe in the Empire very moderately.

                  </note> his father had called him to bee a magistrate in the weale publique, and had giuen him charge of souldiers, he conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to excell his father in all good and ciuil gouernment, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that he was had in great admiration for his vertues, <note place="margin">Eutrop. lib. 7.</note> and commonly called <hi>Delitiae hominu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> the loue and delight of mankinde.

He was so liberall, that he would say that day to be lost when hee <note place="margin">The saying of a good Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</note> had giuen nothing. And being counselled by his friendes that he should not be so liberall: he answered, None ought to depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an Emperour sorowful, for not obtaining their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests: but he had no long life to make proofe of his greatnes. He was very eloquent, of passing great sobrietie, and a stoute warriour. It is saide of <hi>Titus</hi> that he was an excellent archer: for at the assaulting of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> he shot 12. arrowes, and killed with euery arrow a man.</p>
               <p>These two good Emperours <hi>Vespasian</hi> and his sonne <hi>Titus</hi> were well esteemed of in <hi>Rome,</hi> but they liued not long: for <note place="margin">

                  <hi>Vespasian</hi> the father reigned but tenne yeeres, and his sonne <hi>Titus</hi> reigned two yeeres, two moneths and twentie dayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, and died in the very place where his father dyed, at a Manor of his owne among the <hi>Sabines,</hi> in the eightie three yeere after the death of Christ.</p>
               <p>By this <hi>Titus Ierusalem</hi> was the last time destroyed, and the <hi>Iewes</hi> most miserably vanquished and scattered: for <hi>Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pasian</hi>

within 470. yeeres, was diminished by the <hi>Popes:</hi> so that now <hi>Rome</hi> is without either King, Consul, or Emperour, but only a <hi>Pope,</hi> and the pompe of the <hi>Pope</hi> beginneth to quaile. And <note place="margin">

Nowe after this persecution vnder <hi>Flaminius Domitianus,</hi> who banished from <hi>Rome</hi> all the Philosophers and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians, who played the wolfe with the flocke of <hi>Christ,</hi> vnder whom <hi>Simeon</hi> the second <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Eccle. lib. 10. cap. 32.</note> in the behalfe of the Christians, to mitigate the furie and rage of persecution that raigned euery where in <hi>Syria, Iudea, Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria, Antioch,</hi> and all other places, considering they did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <note place="margin">Plini <hi>wrote to</hi> Traiane.</note> but rise in the morning and meete together to sing <hi>Hymnes,</hi> and <hi>Psalmes</hi> to praise God: for <hi>Plini</hi> was amazed and quite astonied to see the multitude and nomber of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans dayly encreasing, notwithstanding all the persecutions and slaughter that was most extreemely vsed against them from time to time.</p>
               <p>This caused <hi>Traiane</hi> the Emperor somewhat more milde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to handle them, commaunding that the Christians should not be sought for to be persecuted, but yet being founde to punish them: for at this time flourished many godly and learned pillars of the Church, as <hi>Ignatius</hi> bishop of <hi>Antioche,</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Iewes,</hi> as men full of madnesse, and voyde of the feare of God, beganne a tumult againe in <hi>Egypt</hi> and in <hi>Alexandria,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Adrianus</hi> commaunded that none should be suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to dwell in any denne of the earth, so that the citie which a litle before hee destroyed and the whole countrey con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, nowe the remnant of the <hi>Iewes</hi> as men forsaken of <note place="margin">Euseb. cap. 6.</note> God, are like vagabonds and roges, banished and whipt out of their countrey, and strangers are come to their place, and the name of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> changed, and called <hi>Aelia,</hi> according to <note place="margin">Hierusalem <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi> Aelia.</note> the name of the <hi>Romane</hi> Emperour.</p>

<pb n="596" facs="tcp:9229:310" rendition="simple:additions"/>
persecutor and a vexer of the Church, cleane against the good Emperor <hi>Antoniuus Pius</hi> his predecessor, who wrote in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note place="margin">Gentiles com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the Christians.</note> all parts of <hi>Asia,</hi> a litle before his latter ende, not onely to spare the Christians fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> persecution, but also to fauour them and to ayde them: letting them to liue to their God whome they serued, commending much their constancie and faith towards their God.</p>
               <p>But while God stirred some good Emperors to fauour his Church and the members thereof, the deuil was as careful to raise sects of heretikes most wicked, to blaspheme the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church: as first <hi>Simon Magus</hi> and his disciple and successor <hi>Menander</hi> the <hi>Samaritane,</hi> by whom two great here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies began, the one being in <hi>Antioch,</hi> the other in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Menander <hi>the</hi> Samaritan, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Magus <hi>scholer.</hi>
                  </note> the first schole of the Christians. The heresies of these two fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> euen in the first place where <hi>Christ</hi> was preached: but it was by God so appointed to exercise his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, so that both heresie &amp; true doctrine doeth encrease with persecution. Now beganne <hi>Basilides, Carponates,</hi> and <hi>Saturninus</hi> 3. great heretikes, successors of <hi>Mena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der.</hi> Of these and of their <note place="margin">Three great heretiques.</note> fundrie sects, I haue to speake in their place.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Antoninus Verus</hi> succeeding his father <hi>Antoninus Pius,</hi> raigned in <hi>Rome:</hi> vnder whom that godly bishop <hi>Polycarpus</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Euseb. 4. cap. 15.</note> suffered martyrdome in <hi>Smirna,</hi> little esteeming the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the <hi>Romane</hi> Proconsul vnder <hi>Antoninus Verus,</hi> the people that were <hi>Iewes</hi> in <hi>Smirna</hi> crying to haue him throwen to the Lions, Saying, that hee onely was the father of all <note place="margin">The fift per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution vnder <hi>Antoninus</hi> sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anmed <hi>Verus.</hi>
                  </note> Christians in <hi>Asia,</hi> a contemner of our gods, and a teacher of false doctrine: but neither the fire that should burne him, neither beastes that were threatned to deuoure him, neither any torment might feare <hi>Polycarpus,</hi> so that he most constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly withstoode their torment. So did <hi>Metrodorus</hi> and <hi>Pio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> two other constant <hi>Martyrs</hi> at that very barre with <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycarpus,</hi> and companied him into the middest of the flame, where confessing their God, they died like good Christians in <hi>Smirna</hi> where <hi>Polycarpus</hi> was bishop. <note place="margin">Anno Christi 170.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Likewise at that time in <hi>Pergame</hi> a towne of <hi>Asia, Papilus</hi>
                  <pb n="597" facs="tcp:9229:310" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and <hi>Carpus,</hi> two valiant souldiers of <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> and <hi>Agathoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> a constant Christian endured the force of the flame, and died, and were crowned with martyrs. <hi>Iustinus</hi> the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, and a worthie <hi>Martyr</hi> of the Church of God, reciteth in his <hi>Apologie</hi> other 3. faithfull <hi>Martyrs,</hi> named <hi>Centurio, Ptolomeus</hi> and <hi>Lucius,</hi> who altogether most boldly stoode to the face of <hi>Vrbicius</hi> then Proconsul of <hi>Rome,</hi> and said, that he iudged neither like the godly Emperour his father, neither like an Emperours sonne, being a Philosopher, neither in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part like a sacred Senator, making no accompt of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent <note place="margin">Godly <hi>Martyrs</hi> feared no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</note> speach, but died like martyred Christians.</p>
               <p>In the 17. yeere of this <hi>Antonius Verus,</hi> diuers parts of <hi>Asia,</hi> and <hi>Affrike</hi> were with persecution visited, insomuch that the congregation of the faithfull dwelling in <hi>Louaine</hi> and <hi>Vienna,</hi> (partes sometime of <hi>Gallia,)</hi> sent letters to comfort the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren euery where dispersed in <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Affrike:</hi> amongst whom I found these many professing the Name of <hi>Iesus,</hi> offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring themselues vnto God as sacrifices readie to the fire, to the sword, to beastes, or to any other torments for <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> sake. Among whom was <hi>Vetius Epagathus</hi> a yong man, who <note place="margin">Vetius.</note> liued so to God, that many followed him with great triumph into the fire: <hi>Potinus</hi> bishop of <hi>Lugdunum,</hi> ful of the spirit, <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charias</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Zacharias.</note> the priest, <hi>Sanctus</hi> a deacon of <hi>Vienna, Attalus</hi> borne in <note place="margin">Luke 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Pergamus,</hi> and <hi>Maturus.</hi> These contended for victorie, and to weare the glorious crownes of <hi>Martyrs:</hi> for they sawe before their faces, howe constantly <hi>Blandina</hi> did stande to the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and how she was bound to a tree, that fierce and wilde <note place="margin">The glory of God is in his Saints.</note> beasts might deuoure her. But God turned the furie and rage ofbeastes to spare and fauour his Saints.</p>
               <p>The like we reade of <hi>Alexander</hi> a Phisition borne in <hi>Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,</hi> which for the Gospel was iudged to bee deuoured of beasts. Infinite was their ioy which they receiued by the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God in their torments, and innumerable were the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the Saincts, that dayly more and more encreased. And as among the olde <hi>Iewes,</hi> sundrie sects of heretikes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to vexe and trouble the Church of God, as the <hi>Saduces,</hi>

                  <hi>Pharisees, Samaritans, Essaei, Masbothia,</hi> and other: so at this time sprang many sorts of heresies: first from <hi>Simon Magus</hi> the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritane:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Simon Magus.</note> from <hi>Menander</hi> his disciple and successour: from <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnius, Valentianus, Cerdon,</hi> and many other, whereby many false prophets, false apostles, false <hi>antichrists,</hi> sowed sedition in the Church, and opposed themselues against <hi>Christ</hi> and his Church.</p>
               <p>But in vaine were all the shifts of Satan: for God raised such armies against them of men, of women, of children that <note place="margin">The shifts of Satan is in vaine.</note> confirmed their doctrine with their blood. The more they wrote, the lesse credite it had: the more they stirred, the lesse they accomplished: for the <hi>Martyrs</hi> of God amazed their fleshly cogitations, and fully vanquished their wicked de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uises, God raised good and godly men, and singular wel lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as <hi>Hegesippus, Appolinarius, Meliton,</hi> bishops of <hi>Sardis, Pini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> bishop of <hi>Creete, Dionisius</hi> bishop of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> with many others.

After the destruction of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> in <hi>Alexandria</hi> in the ninth yeere of <hi>Comodus</hi> the Emperour, was <hi>Iulianus</hi> bishop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> after <hi>Agrippinus,</hi> at what time <hi>Pautenus</hi> read the Diuinitie lecture to the Christians, a great scholer and a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher of the sect of the <hi>Stoikes,</hi> a man full of godly zeale, that trauailed from <hi>Alexandria</hi> to <hi>Iudea,</hi> to preache and to teach Christ.

                  <hi>Heros</hi> the fift, with the successours of them, flourished this time. And in the tenth yeere of <hi>Antonius Comodus</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, many learned, graue, and godly men flourished in this blasphemous time, among so many wicked and lewde here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, that liued now in the worlde, as <hi>Theophilus</hi> bishop of <hi>Caesarea,</hi> some say of <hi>Antiochia, Banchillus,</hi> and <hi>Policrates,</hi> the one bishop in <hi>Corinth,</hi> the other in <hi>Ephesus, Demetrius</hi> of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi> and <hi>Serapion</hi> of <hi>Antiochia,</hi> the eight bishop.</p>
               <p>After the Apostles there was no part of <hi>Asia</hi> emptie from godly men, of whom particularly to speake, how they liued, <note place="margin">Euseb. 5. cap. 19.</note> and bowe they died, I may not, for that their number is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, and noting onely the chiefe bishops and learned men, and fewe <hi>Martyrs</hi> in respect of the whole, I will but briefly touch them. In this Emperours time the Church had some quietnesse, and in respect of much persecution before, they were called <hi>Halcyonia sub Comodo Ecclesiae,</hi> (and yet <hi>Comodus</hi> a wicked Emperour as euer liued) at what time they receiued the faith: for euen then <hi>Appolonius</hi> a Philosopher, a Senator <note place="margin">
