            <title>The unbishoping of Timothy and Titus. Or A briefe elaborate discourse, prooving Timothy to be no bishop (much lesse any sole, or diocæsan bishop) of Ephesus, nor Titus of Crete and that the power of ordination, or imposition of hands, belongs jure divino to presbyters, as well as to bishops, and not to bishops onely. Wherein all objections and pretences to the contrary are fully answered; and the pretended superiority of bishops over other ministers and presbyters jure divino, (now much contended for) utterly subverted in a most perspicuous maner.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>First,</hi> there is not one ſyllable in Scripture (wherein the Titles and actions of Timothy are frequently mentioned) which either directly, or by way of neceſſary conſequence, imply Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy, to be either a Biſhop, or Biſhop of Epheſus; which Paul in his Epiſtles to Epheſus, and Timothy, and S.

            <p n="6">6. As Timothy was ſent by Paul to the Churches of <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth, Philippi, and Theſſalonica, ſo hee joynes with Paul in his Epistles written to thoſe Churches, directed to them in both their names:</hi> witneſſe 2, Cor. 1, 1, Phil. 1, 1. 1, Theſ. 1, 1, 2, Theſ. 1, 1, in which Epiſtles <hi>Paul makes frequent of Timothy:</hi> witneſſe 1, Cor. 4, 17, c. 16, 10.

               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:14723:23"/>
and in his <hi>Epiſtle to the Hebrewes written by Timothy as his Scribe, hee makes mention of his delivery out of priſon by name,</hi> Hebr. 13, 23. <note n="*" place="margin">Note well.</note> But in the Epiſtle to the Epheſians, <hi>written from Rome, long after Timothy was ſuppoſed to be made Biſhop of Epheſus;</hi> Timothy neither joynes with Paul in the inditement or ſalutation, neither doth Paul ſo much as once name or mention him throughout that Epiſtle, as he doth in all the other Epiſtles to the Churches whether hee ſent him, and in every of his Epiſtles elſe to any Church, except in his Epiſtle to the Galathians. Timothy therefore doubtleſſe was not Biſhop of Epheſus at this ſeaſon; elſe he would have vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to have joyned with Paul in his Epiſtle to the Epheſians, as well as in his Epiſtles to other Churches; or Paul being his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Friend and applauder, would have made ſome honorable mention and commendation of him to the Church of Epheſus, (his owne peculiar Dioces as ſome affirme,) as he doth in his Epiſtles to moſt other Churches, where he was never Biſhop. An unanſwerable argument in my opinion, that Timothy was never Biſhop of Epheſus, ſince there is no newes at all either from, or of, or to, or concerning him in Pauls Epiſtle to the Epheſians, of which hee is ſurmiſed, to be the firſt, ſole and genuine Biſhop.</p>
            <p n="7">7.

Timothy was neither negligent, nor impotent in his function: therefore the latter, he being then, no Biſhop, nor yet exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing his Epiſcopall Juriſdiction there.</p>
            <p n="8">8.

during which time of Paules reſidence there <hi>(in all 3.

            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the Church of Epheſus at that time, <hi>had not one but many Biſhops, and that by the very inſtitution of the Holy Ghost:</hi> Therefore Timothy could not be ſole Biſhop there, by Pauls inſtitution, in oppoſition to the holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That theſe Biſhops <hi>knew from the firſt day that Paul came into Aſia, after what maner he had been with them at all ſeaſons:</hi> and therefore, in all likelyhood, were appointed Biſhops of Epheſus at the very firſt planting of that Church, before Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy was ſetled Biſhop: ſo that he was not the firſt Biſhop there; but theſe rather, before, or as ſoone as he.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That Timothy was then neither Elder, nor Biſhop of that Church at this time when Paul tooke his farewell of it; <hi>hee comming with Paul out of Macedonia to Miletus, and being none of the Elders and Biſhops ſent for, from Epheſus, to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:14723:26"/>
whom alone Paul directed his speech:</hi> who had hee then beene ſole or prime Biſhop of that See, Paul would not have ſtiled the Elders which he ſent for, <hi>Biſhops of that flocke,</hi> at leaſtwiſe hee would have made ſome ſpeciall mention of Timothy in this ſpeech of his, and given him ſome ſpeciall inſtructions for the inſtructing and governing of that Church: Or at leaſt have ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored Timothy ſo farre, as to have made him give this Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall charge. and inſtruction to the Elders and Biſhops of his owne proper Church and Dioces, or to have enjoyned them in ſpeciall maner to reverence, honor and yeild him all Canonicall obedience as their ſupreame Diocaeſan. All which Paul utterly neglects, or forgets to doe; or particularly to charge Timothy to take heed to or feed this flocke, hee being ofta Nonreſident from it, as I have prooved. Yea, <hi>making ſuch hast to be at Hieruſalem by the feast of Pentecost,</hi> v. 16. that hee could not ſpare time to goe to Epheſus, hee needed not to haue ſent for the Elders of Epheſus to Miletus to give them theſe inſtructions, ſince Timothy their Biſhop was then preſent with him, to whom hee might and would no doubt have imparted them, without further trouble, hath hee then in truth beene Biſhop of that Church. But this ſending for theſe Elders in his haſt, and ſtiling them <hi>Biſhops of that flocke, &amp;c.</hi> without any mention at all of Timothy, who was none of the Elders ſent for to Epheſus, is an infallible evidence, that hee was neither Biſhop, nor firſt or ſole Biſhop of that Citty. Adde wee to this, <hi>that when Paul exhorted Timothy to abide at Epheſus, there were then in that Citty Elders, who did both rule well, and labor in the word and doctrine, and ſo were worthy double honor,</hi>

               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> To which I anſwer; <hi>First,</hi> that this Poſtſcript is no Scripture, (&amp; all others as in <note n="‡" place="margin">Comment. on Gal. 6. p. 497. 498. 499.</note> 
               <hi>M. Perkins</hi> workes is prooved at large) no part of the Epiſtle, no Appendix of S. Paules, but a private obſervation, annexed to it, by ſome Scribe or other after the Epiſtle written without any divine inſpiration; as the words themſelves demonſtrate; <hi>The SECOND Epiſtle unto Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motheus ordained the firſt Biſhop of the Church of the Epheſians, was written from Rome, when Paul was brought before Nero the ſecond time.</hi> Where obſerve; Firſt, that this Poſtſcript is written not in the name of Paul, <hi>but of ſome third perſon</hi> as the whole frame of it Demonſtrates.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> that this Poſtſcript is no direction given by Paul to Timothy as the words <hi>(the ſecond Epistle unto Timotheus, ordained the firſt Biſhop of the Church of the Epheſians, was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten &amp;c.)</hi> evidence, but a direction of ſome Notary or <note n="*" place="margin">Perchance Theodoret. the firſt in whom I finde any Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts. 430. yeares after Christ.</note>

            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The words <hi>WAS WRITTEN &amp;c.</hi> in the preter imperfect tenſe, ſhewes this poſtſcript to be a meere addition of ſome Scribe or Expoſiter, ſome good ſpace after the Epiſtle written; not of Paul himſelfe, at the time when he writt it; all the Poſtſcripts of his other Epiſtles, appearing mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly not to bee his, by the ſame reaſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It is here called, <hi>the ſecond Epiſtle unto Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus,</hi> in relation to the <hi>firſt;</hi> and the firſt Epiſtle to him, written many yeares before it, is likewiſe ſtiled, in the Poſtſript of it, <hi>The firſt to Timothy</hi> with reference to the ſecond. As therefore the Poſtſcript of the firſt Epiſtle was certainly added by ſome Notary after the ſecond Epiſtle written, ſince it is called the firſt in relation to it: ſo no doubt the Poſtſcript of the ſecond Epiſtle was annexed to it after the firſt Epiſtle, and it was tranſcribed and bound up together, by the ſame party that added the Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:14723:28"/>
to the firſt; the Poſtſcript ſtiling them thus the 1. and 2. in regard of their mutuall relation one to the other; after they were both conjoyned, and the New Teſtament and Paules Epiſtles, digeſted into that order and method, wherein now they are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, both in manuſcripts and printed Coppies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> It is very unlikely, that Paul would make ſuch a Poſtſcript as this. For as theſe words <hi>(was written from Rome, when Paul was brought before Nero the 2. time)</hi> ſound not of Paules language but ſome others; ſo the ſecond Epiſtle unto Timotheus <hi>ordained the first Biſhop of the Church of the Epheſians,</hi> ſavour not of his inditing; who never in any of his Epiſtles to him or others ſtiles him a Biſhop, much leſſe <hi>ordained the first Biſhop of the Church of the Epheſians,</hi> neither would he have made ſuch a deſcription of Timothy as this, to Timothy himſelfe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixtly, None of the other Apostles have any Poſtſcripts added to any of their Epiſtles;</hi> it is likely therefore that Paul gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the ſame Spirit, added none to all, or any of his, but that they <note n="*" place="margin">See Master Perkins com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. on Gal. 6. p. 497. 498. 499. when this is largely prooved.</note> were added by ſome other, who either transſcribed and collected his Epiſtles together, or commented on them; as were the ſeverall Titles both before and over his ſeverall Epiſtles, and the contents before each Chapter, both in manuſcripts, and printed Copyes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seaventhly,</hi> It is apparant, that the Poſtſcripts of many, of Paules Epiſtles are forged and falſe, as <note n="*" place="margin">Comment. on Gal. 6. p. 497. 498. 499.</note> 
               <hi>M.

            <p>
               <hi>Eightly,</hi> This Poſtſcript is directly contrary to the very preface and body of the Epiſtle, written no doubt by Paul; which as it expreſly ſtyles Timothy <hi>an Euangeliſt,</hi> not a Biſhop; <hi>exhorting him to make full proofe of his Miniſtery;</hi> not of his Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hopricke. c. 4. v, 5.

            <p>
               <hi>Ninthly,</hi> This Poſtſcript is directly contradictory to many fore-alleadged Scriptures, which proove Timothy to be no Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop, muchleſſe the firſt or ſole Biſhop of the Church of the Epheſians; therefore not to be beleeved. See Acts. 20. 28.</p>

becauſe neither the body nor Poſtſcript of that Epiſtle; nor any other Scripture whatſoever, ſtiles him, either a Biſhop, or Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop of Epheſus, <hi>though hee</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. To this I anſwer: firſt, that <hi>Paul by a Biſhop in this Epistle meanes no Diocaeſan Biſhop in dignity and

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Admit it meant of a Diocaeſan Biſhop, yet it followes not thence, that Timothy was ſuch a one: this <hi>Epiſtle being written rather to inſtruct others then Timothy,</hi> who was ſo well tutered before, both by his grand mother, <hi>Lois and Paul,</hi> 1. Tim. 6. 12. 20. c. 4. 6. 14. 16. 2. Tim. 1. 5. 6. 13. 14. c. 2. 2. c. 3. 10. 14. 15. <hi>rather, for a patterne of the qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and duety of Miniſters; to direct the Church in all future ages, then to informe Timothy at that time: whence in both theſe Epiſtles there are ſome predictions of the Apoſtacy and degeneracy of the laſt times;</hi> more neceſſary for <note n="i" place="margin">Non ſolum Timotheum ſed &amp; omnem per hoc ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monet Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copum: Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumenius in 1.

            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> there is in the ſame chapter inſtructions given, <hi>concerning Deacons, Widdowes, and others;</hi> yet Timothy was neither Deacon nor Widdow; which being neceſſary for the Church of God, and for Timothy alſo to know, as hee was an Euangeliſt, a fellow-helper and aſſiſtant of Paul in his Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall and Apoſtolicall function, and as his delegate to order and regulate the Church accordingly, argue him to be no more a Biſhop, as is ſurmiſed; then that every <hi>Minister and Chriſtian for</hi>

               <hi>whoſe inſtruction and direction this Epiſtle was written as well as for Timothies</hi> are Biſhops; or then any Archbiſhops, or Biſhops inſtructions to their Archdeacons, Vicars Generalls, Chauncellers or Officials for Eccleſiaſticall affaires, or Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, argue them to be Archbiſhops or Biſhops.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:14723:30"/>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We read of divers bookes, concerning the office and regiment of Kings, of Magiſtrates, and Captaines dedicated to young Princes, and others who were neither Kings, Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, nor Captaines; of diverſe tractates concerning Biſhops, inſcribed to ſuch who were no Biſhops; yet the dedicating of ſuch Treatiſes to them, did neither conſtitute or neceſſarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them to be Kings, Magiſtrates, Captaines, Biſhops. Why then ſhould this Epiſtle to Timothy, wherein are ſome things concerning the office, qualities, and duties of a Biſhop, proove him convincingly to be ſuch a one.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> 3. The third evidence to proove Timothy a Biſhop, is taken from the 1. Tim. 5. 22. Where hee is enjoyned, to lay <hi>hands ſuddenly on no man;</hi> that is, to ordaine no man ſuddenly, a Miniſter. Therefore certainly, hee was a Biſhop, becauſe none but Biſhops have power to ordaine Miniſters.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I anſwer firſt, that the laying on of hands hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſignifications in Scripture. Sometimes, it is taken <hi>for an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of another, as a Mal factor to puniſh, or bring him to judgement for his offences,</hi> Exod. 24. 11. Eſther 8. 7. Gen. 37. 22. Exod. 6. 13. Nehem. 13. 1. Luke. 21. 22. in which ſence it may be well taken here, as the proceeding verſes evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Sometimes it is uſed for <hi>reconciliation of perſons at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance,</hi> Iob. 9. 33. Sometimes for <hi>benediction</hi> or bleſſing of <hi>another,</hi> Matth. 9. 15. Sometimes for <hi>curing and healing,</hi> Mark. 5. 23. Math. 19. 18. Mark. 6. 5. Luke. 4. 40. Sometimes for <hi>confirmation,</hi> as many affirme, Acts, 8. 17. 18. 19. Sometimes for <hi>ordination,</hi> as Acts. 6, 6 cap. 8, 17. 11. cap. 13. 3. 1. Timoth. 4. 14. 2. Timoth. 1. 6. Acts. 19. 6.

            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:14723:31"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Admit it is meant of ordination<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it; yet that prooves not Timothy to be a Biſhop, ſince not onely <hi>Apoſtles, Euangelists, and the Apoſtles fellow-helpers had power of ordination, as they were ſuch,</hi> Act. 1, 22, 25, 26. c. 6, 6, c. 8, 17, 18, c. 13, 1, 2, 3. c. 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 23, c. 19, 6. Tit. 1, 5. 2, Tim. 1. 6. but even <hi>Preſbyters themſelves:</hi> Acts. 9, 17. c. 13, 1, 2, 3. c. 14, 23<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. Tim. 4, 14. and Timothy might exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe this power in all or either of theſe reſpects, not as a Biſhop; which for ought appeares hee never was; neither read wee in Scripture that ordination belongs of right to Biſhops, as Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops; muchleſſe, that it is appropriated unto them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> 4. The fourth objection to proove Timothy a Biſhop<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is this; <hi>that hee is commaunded to rebuke ſuch as ſinned openly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all men, that others might feare,</hi> 1, Tim. 5, 20. Therefore hee was a Biſhop.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I anſwere, that the argument is an inconſequent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe hee might doe this as an Euangeliſt, or as Paules aſſociate or ſubſtitute, by vertue of his Apoſtolicall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, not of his owne Epiſcopall Iuriſdiction, as Biſhops Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficials, Chauncellors and Vicars Generall, rebuke, correct and viſit others, not in their owne names, or by their owne autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, but their Lords.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Hee might doe this as a Miniſter, <hi>every Miniſter having power ſufficient in the publike Ministery of the word, openly to rebuke all ſinnes and ſinners,</hi> Iſay. 5, 8. 1, 2. Tim. 4, 2, 3. Tit. 1, 13, c. 2, 15. Marke. 6, 18, 19, 20. 2, Sam. 12, 7.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Hee might doe this as a private Chriſtian; every Chriſtian being enjoyned <hi>in any caſe to rebuke his neighbour, and not to ſuffer ſinne upon him:</hi> Levit. 19. 17. Prov. 9, 8. Eccleſ. 9, 5. <hi>and ſo is every Magiſtrate to doe,</hi> Nehem. 13. 11. to 31.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:14723:31"/>
Pſal. 141. 5. This therefore is no argument of any Epiſcopall Juriſdiction; the rather, becauſe this rebuke was to be <hi>publikely in the Church before all,</hi> not in a private Chamber or Conſiſtory Court, (as all Expoſitors accord) in which our Biſhops pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce their Cenſures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> 5. The fift argument to proove Timothy a Biſhop, is the 1 Tim. 5, 19. <hi>Against an Elder receive not an accuſation, but before two or three witneſſes.</hi> Hee had power to receive an accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation againſt Miniſters, that ſo hee might correct them; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee was a Biſhop.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I anſwer firſt, that this is a meere <hi>Non ſequitur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For 1. Hee might have this power, to receive ſuch accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations as an Euangeliſt, and Paules Coadjutor.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As Paules Delegate or Officiall; as our Biſhops Officialls, Vicars and Chauncellors now exerciſe Epiſcopall Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction under them; as their ſubſtitutes onely, not by any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Epiſcopall dignity or authority in themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Hee might doe it by the appointement and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall conſent of the people, <hi>who had power in all caſes of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, to conſtitute any man a Iudge, though no Biſhop,</hi> 1. Cor. 6, 1, to 7.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Hee might doe it onely as an Elder; <hi>Elders ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving power to rule well,</hi> 1. Tim. 5. 17. and ſo by conſequence, to receive <hi>accuſations, and to correct delinquents by reproofes or Eccleſiasticall Cenſures, with the conſequent of the Congregation,</hi> 1, Cor. 5, 4, 5. 11, 12, c. 6, 1, to 7.

            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> I had almoſt added, that hee might have done it as an Eccleſiaſticall Commiſſioner, but that I conſidered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that hee

Church, to bring the guilty perſon into Iudgement, openly to reproove, which not onely Superiors may doe, but alſo aequals and inferiors. In the Roman Republike Knights did judge not onely the people, but alſo the Senators, and Patricij.

Thus Biſhops heretofore, if any Elder or Biſhop had an ill report, referred it to the Eccleſiaſticall Senate or Synod, and condemned him, if hee ſeemed worthy by a publike judgement, that is, they did ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuſpend, excommunicate or remoove him. The Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop condemned nocent Elders and Deacons, not with his owne authority alone, but with the judgement of the Church and Clergy. Thoſe who where thus condemned, might lawfully appeale to the Metropolitan; but hee could not preſently alone determine, what ſeemed good to him, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Synod to give ſentence, and what the Synod de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed was ratified.</hi> The ſame anſwer <hi>Martyn Bucer, De vi &amp; uſu.

            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Theſe Fathers affirme not Timothy to be ſole Biſhop of Epheſus, or to be Diocaeſan Biſhop, or ſuch a Biſhop as is ſuperior to a Presbyter in Juriſdiction or degree; the thing which ought to be prooved; and if they affirmed any ſuch thing, yet ſeeing the fore-alleadged Scriptures contradict it in a moſt

            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> 7. If any finally object, that <hi>Paul deſired Timothy to abide ſtill at Epheſus when hee went into Macedonia:</hi> 1, Tim. 1. 3. and that the Greeke verbe <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>ſignifies a conſtant reſidence, or abiding in one place.</hi> Therefore Timothy was Biſhop of Ephe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſus: which if it be a ſolid Argument, prooves many of our Court Nonreſident Prelates and Miniſters, to be no Biſhops (becauſe they reſide and abide, not muchleſſe preach and keepe hoſpitality on their Biſhoprickes,) rather then Timothy to be Diocaeſan Biſhop of Epheſus.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:14723:35"/>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. To this I anſwer, firſt, that the argument is a groſſe inconſequent. For Timothy might abide thus at Epheſus as an Euangeliſt, as an Elder, as Paules aſſiſtant, or ſubſtitute onely; as an ordinary Miniſter, not as a Biſhop; his abiding therefore at Epheſus is inſufficient to conſtitute him a Diocaeſan Biſhop of that Sec.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, Paul and Titus ordained Elders in every Church to abide and continue, with their flockes:</hi> Acts. 14, 23. Tit. 1, 5, 7. yet the Oppoſites deny theſe Elders to be Diocaeſan Biſhops.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, Every ordinary Miniſter is to reſide and abide upon his Cure,</hi> Rom. 12, 7, 8. 1, Cor. 7, 20. Ier. 23, 1, 5. If this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument therefore where ſolid, every Miniſter ſhould be a Diocaeſan Biſhop.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly, Paul left</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Acts. 18. 18. 19.</note> 
               <hi>Aquila and Priſcilla at Epheſus to abide there;</hi> Will it therefore follow, that they where Diocaeſan Biſhops of the Epheſians? If not, then the argument is invalid.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw. 2. Secondly,</hi> I anſwer, <hi>That Timothy was to abide at Epheſus onely for a ſeaſon, till Paules returne out of Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia and no longer,</hi> 1, Tim. 3. 14, 15, c. 4, 13, 14. <hi>after which hee went with Paul from Macedonia into Aſia to Troas,</hi> Acts. 20. 4, 5. <hi>and from thence to Italy, Philippi, and Rome,</hi> Heb. 13, 23. Phil. 1, 1, c. 2. 19. Col. 1, 1. 2, Tim. 4. 9, 13. hee being never reſident at Epheſus, (for ought appeares in Scripture or authentique ſtory,) after Paules returne out of Macedonia. His abode therefore at Epheſus being but for ſo ſhort a time, and hee ſo great a Nonreſident from it afterward, cannot poſſibly argue him to be a Diocaeſan Biſhop of that Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw. 3. Thirdly,</hi> Greeke word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to abide, is oft <hi>applyed in Scripture to a ſhort abode, for a day or two, or ſome little ſpace,</hi> as well as to a perpetuall fixed reſidence; as Math. 15,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:14723:35"/>
32. Marke 8. 2. So it is in the objected text; where it is put on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in oppoſition to Paules journey into Macedonia; in reſpect whereof Timothy continuing at Epheſus till his returne, might be truely ſaid, <hi>to abide there,</hi> though after his returne hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooved thence to other Churches; as <hi>Gerſonius Bucerus, De Gubernatione Eccleſiae. p, 502. to</hi> 518, obſerves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw. 4. Fourthly,</hi> Paul did not injoyne, <hi>but beſeech Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy to abide at Epheſus:</hi> therefore his reſidence there was but arbitrary at his owne pleaſure, not coactive, not injoyned by vertue of any Epiſcopall office; this Text therefore cannot proove Timothy to be Biſhop of Epheſus, no more then his ſtay at Corinth, and other places whether Paul ſent him, proove him to be Biſhop of thoſe Churches.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw. 5. Finally,</hi> Admit Timothy to be both the firſt and <note place="margin">Timothy no Diocaeſan Biſhop of Epheſus.</note> ſole Biſhop of Epheſus, which is falſe; yet this makes nothing for, but againſt our Hierarchicall and Diocaeſan Biſhops: <hi>for Epheſus was but one City, one Pariſh, one Church, one flocke and Congregation;</hi> as is evident by Acts. 20. 17, 28, 29, c. 18, 24, 25, 26, c. 19, 1. to 18, Epheſ. 1, 1, c. 4, 4, 16, c. 6, 21, 22, 23. 1, Tim. 1, 3, c. 5, 17 to 23. Rev. 1, 20, c. 2. 1. So that the argument from this example is but this; Timothy was onely Biſhop of one City, Pariſh, Church, Flock and Congregation, not of many: Therefore all Biſhops ought to be ſo too, as well as hee.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> If any object, that the City of Epheſus was a Dioces; for it had <hi>many Elders,</hi> therefore many Pariſhes, and ſeverall Congregations? Acts. 20, 17, 28. 1, Tim. 5. 17.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I anſwer, that the argument followes not; For firſt, in <hi>the Apostles times, and in the primitive Church, every particular Church and Congregation had</hi>

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> wee at this day, have many Prebends, Canons, and Miniſters in every Cathedrall and Collegiate Church, yea in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Colledge in our Vniverſities, and elſewhere; yet but one Church and Congregation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We have in many other Churches in the Country where the Pariſhes are large, and there are divers Chappels of eaſe, many Curates and Miniſters; yet but one Church, one Pariſh; not a Dioces; neither is the cheife Miniſter either a Biſhop or Diocaeſan, though hee have diverſe Curates and Miniſters under him, to aſſiſt him in his Miniſtery: yea in many places where there is but one Church, no ſuch Chappels of eaſe, and the Pariſh great, we have ſeverall Miniſters, Lecturers, and Curates, in ſome 4, or 5, in moſt 2, or 3, yet no Dioces, no Biſhopricke.

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I anſwer, that admit there were divers Churches and Congregations in Epheſus, which is very improbable, <hi>the greatest part of the Citizens being Idolaters, and the Citty itſelfe a worſhipper of the great Goddeſſe Diana, and of the Image which fell downe from Jupiter,</hi> Acts. 19 21. to 41. yet it can not be prooved, that Timothy was cheife Biſhop and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendent over all theſe Churches, but onely of one of them: as every Miniſter and Biſhop of England is a Miniſter and Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop of the Church of England, but not a Miniſter and Biſhop in and over all the Curches of England, but in and over his owne Pariſh Church, and Dioces onely.

Since therefore every one of theſe Elders by the Holy Ghoſtes inſtitution, and Paules reſolution was no other, but a <hi>Biſhop</hi> over his owne flocke, (if ſeverall,) both to inſtruct and rule it; it is certaine, that Timothy (if hee were a Biſhop of Epheſus and there were many Churches there,) was onely Biſhop of one of them, not of all; and ſo no Diocaeſan Biſhop, as our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates and their flatterers vainely pretend. Timothy therefore being neither a Biſhop, nor firſt, ſole, or any Biſhop of Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, or of any other place, or if a Biſhop, no Diocaeſan Biſhop, but of one Church and congregation onely, as theſe premiſes evidence, all our Prelates inferences drawne from his example to proove their Epiſcopall Authority and Juriſdiction <hi>Iure Divino,</hi> (which for the moſt part hang upon his Epiſcopall rochet onely) fall quite to ground, and their Epiſcopall Authority together with it. I now proceed to the next Queſtion (wherein I ſhall likewiſe diſcuſſe, <hi>whether the power of ordination belongs onely to Biſhops, not to Presbyters? And whether this Paradoxe of the Prelates be true, that ordainers are greater in Iuriſdiction and degree then thoſe that are ordained?)</hi> to wit;</p>

               <hi>Whether Titus were ever Biſhop, or Archbiſhop of Crete?</hi>

            <p>What ever the common bruite and Error of theſe or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times conceive, under correction, I perſwade my ſelfe, that Titus was no Biſhop nor Archbiſhop of Crete: and that for theſe enſuing reaſons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> becauſe the Scripture never ſtiles him a Biſhop; nor S.

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe his <hi>cheifeſt imployment was to the Church of Corinth, after that hee had been left by Paul in Creet, as Paules partner and fellow-helper in that Church,</hi> 2. Cor. 2. 13. c. 7. 6. 13. c. 8. 6. 16. 23. c. 12, 18.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Becauſe hee <hi>was Paules companion, attendant, partner, fellow-helper, Meſſenger, fixed to no ſetled place of reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> as Biſhops were, 2.

            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Becauſe Paul writes expreſly to him, Tit. 1. 5. not that hee ordained him Archbiſhop or Biſhop of Crete, but <hi>that hee left him in Creet</hi> (for a ſeaſon) <hi>for this cauſe, that hee ſhould ſett in order, the things that were wanting, and ordaine El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, in every Citty, as hee had appointed him:</hi> Therefore was hee there onely as Paules Vicar generall, Commiſſary or ſubſtitute, to order thoſe things, <hi>in ſuch ſort, as hee had appointed him,</hi> which Paul could not diſpatch, whiles hee was reſiding, not as the Archbiſhop or Lord Biſhop of Creet, to order all things there, by his owne Epiſcopall Juriſdiction and authority as hee liſted himſelfe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Hee expreſly charged him, <hi>to come to him dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, to Nicopolis when hee ſhould ſent Arthemas or Tychicus to him, for there hee intended to winter,</hi> Tit. 3. 12. By which it is evident, that his ſtay in Creet by Paules appointement, was very ſhort, not above halfe a yeare, if ſo much; after which wee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver read hee returned thither, though we finde, <hi>hee was ſent to Corinth, and Dalmatia, that hee went up to Hieruſalem with Paul, and came to him during his impriſonment at Rome,</hi> Gal. 2. 1. 3. 2. Cor. 2. 13. c. 7. 13. 14. c. 8. 6, 16. 23. c. 12. 8. 2. Tim. 4. 10. His ſhort abode therefore in Creet, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning thither, prooves him to be no Biſhop.</p>

               <hi>Sixtly,</hi> Paul chargeth him, to bring <hi>Zenas the Lawyer and and Apollos diligently on their way, that nothing might be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to them,</hi> Tit. 3. 13. Now it is very unlikely, that an Arch-biſhop or Biſhop of Creete, <hi>wherein were</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Homer.

            <p>
               <hi>Seaventhly,</hi> Paul left Titus Biſhop of no one Citty in Creete, and hee expreſly enjoynes him, <hi>to ordaine</hi> (not one but many) <hi>Elders</hi> (in the plurall number) <hi>in every Citty of Creete,</hi> Tit. 1. 5. 7. where there were no leſſe then 90. <hi>walled Citties in Homerus time;</hi> which Elders were no other but <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and ſo tearmed by him v. 7. <hi>(For a BISHOP must be blameleſſe, &amp;c.)</hi> as <hi>Hierom.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We read not a word to this purpoſe in Scripture of any Biſhops diſtinct from, or ſuperior, in order, degree and dignity to Presbyters; if therefore ſuch Biſhops themſelves be not <hi>Jure divino,</hi> the power of ordination cannot belong to them <hi>Jure divino,</hi> the rather becauſe we read of no man whom the Scripture cals a Biſhop ordaining Miniſters.</p>
            <p>Admit there were ſuch Biſhops <hi>Jure divino;</hi> yet that the power of ordination belongs to them <hi>Jure Divino quatenus</hi> ſuch Biſhops, is moſt falſe, but onely <hi>quatenus</hi> they are Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters: For it appertained to the Apoſtles, to the Euangeliſts, to Diſciples and Presbyters <hi>Iure divino,</hi> though no ſuch Biſhops; and the objectors will acknowledge, that it belongs to Popes, Patriarkes, Metropolitans and Archbiſhops, though they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were nor are properly ſuch Biſhops, and are no divine, but meere humane inſtitutions; therefore it muſt appertaine unto them onely, as they are Miniſters, (in which reſpect they all accord, and are not differenced one from another;) not <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenus</hi> Biſhops; for then the Apoſtles, Euangeliſts, Diſciples, Presbyters, Popes, Patriarkes, Metropolitanes, and Arch-biſhops, being not properly ſuch Biſhops, could not lawfully ordaine.

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the Councell expreſly reſolves, <hi>that the power and right of ordination is prohibited Preſbyters, and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated onely to Biſhops, not by any Law of God,</hi> or ancient Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of the Apoſtles, or thoſe who immediately ſucceeded them, <hi>but onely by ſome Eccleſiaſticall Canons and Conſtitutions then newly made,</hi> and <hi>by the authority onely of the See of Rome;</hi> which cannot deprive Miniſters of that power of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which the Scripture and God himſelfe hath given them.</p>

            <p>By which it is plaine, that in the primitive Church, Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters did not onely ordaine Preſbyters and Deacons, before there were any Biſhops elected and inſtituted; but likewiſe, that after Biſhops were inſtituted, they ordained and conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Biſhops (as well as Elders and Deacons,) and that the ſole ordination and conſecration of Biſhops in the Primitive and pureſt times, was nothing but the Preſbyters bare election and inthronization of them without more ſolemnity; So that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Rites and Ceremonies now uſed, are but Novelties. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelme Archbiſhop of Canterbury</hi> on the 1.

            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> that in the defect of Biſhops, any one that was but a meere Preiſt, was ſufficient to adminiſter any Sacrament or Sacramentals whatſoever either found in Scripture, or added ſince.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That one who was but a meere Preiſt might ordaine another, and that hee, who was ordained onely by a ſimple Preiſt, ought not to doubt of his Preſbyterſhip, or to be ordained againe, ſo as hee rightly performed his clericall office, becauſe the ordination comes from God, who ſupplies all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That meere Preiſts may ordaine Preiſts, Deacons and Biſhops too; even as the inferior Preiſts among the Jewes did ordaine and conſecrate the High Preiſt, as Biſhops conſecrate Archbiſhops, and the Cardinals the Pope.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That the power of order is equall, and the ſame in Biſhops and Preiſts, and that by their very ordination they have power given them by Chriſt to adminiſter all Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments alike; therefore to conferre orders and confirme children, which is the leſſe, as well as to baptiſe, adminiſter the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper and preach the Goſpell, which is the greater.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fiftly,</hi> That Chriſt ſitting in heaven hath given the power of conſecrating and ordaining Preiſts and Deacons, of Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and all other things, which Biſhops now challenge to themſelves, to juſt Preſbyters; and that theſe things were but of late times, even above 300. yeares after Chriſt, reſerved

Not that impoſition of hands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth onely to him, for the reſt of the Elders that were preſent at ordination did lay on their hands, or elſe the Biſhop did lay on his
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:14723:58"/>
hands in the name of the reſt. We differ from the Papiſts in this; They affirme; that not principally and cheifly, but ſolely and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the right of conſecrating and giving Orders appertaineth unto Biſhops. But concerning the power of giving Orders we ſay; that though it were cheifly in the Apostles, yet the Paſtors and Elders together with them layd on their hands,</hi> Acts. 13. 3. 4. <hi>and as S. Paul speaketh of his laying on of hands,</hi> 2. Tim. 1. 6. <hi>ſo hee maketh mention of impoſition of hands by the Elderſhip,</hi> 1. Tim. 4. 14. <hi>And the Rhemiſts on that place miſlike not the practiſe of their Church, that their Preists doe lay on their hands together with the Biſhop upon his head that is to be ordained. What elſe doth this ſignifie, but that they have ſome interest in ordaining together with the Biſhop? The 4. Councell of Carthage Can. 3. Decrees thus: Let all the Preiſts that are preſent, hold their hands next to the Biſhops hand, upon the head of him that is to be ordained. Againe Can. 14. of the ſame Councell: The Biſhop must not give orders, but in the preſence and aſſembly of the Clergy. By this then it is manifest, that impoſition of hands doth not wholly and ſoly belong to the Biſhops, ſeeing the reſt of the Elders were wont to lay on their hands likewiſe, or the Biſhop in the name of the reſt. So that the Elders were not excluded. Doctor Feild</hi> in his 5. <hi>Booke of the Church, c.</hi> 27. is of the ſame opinion; where hee prooves out of <hi>Durandus and other Papiſts, that the power of conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and order is not greater in Biſhops then in any other Ministers; that the power of ordination was reſerved to Biſhops, not by any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, but humane Conſtitutions onely, rather for to honor the Biſhops preistly place, then for that it might not be done by any other, and for the avoyding of confuſion and ſchiſme in the Church: Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that in caſes of neceſſity; as when Biſhops are extinguiſhed by death; or fallen into haereſie, or obſtinately refuſe to ordaine men to preach the Word and Gospell of Chriſt ſincerely, and the like, then Miniſters onely may ordaine other Miniſters, without any Biſhops aſſiſtance.</hi> And <hi>Maſter Cartwright in his Confutation of the Rhem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>

            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That as to the right force and vertue which it hath in conſtituting the Miniſter of the Church, it alwayes apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines to the whole Church; as the celebration of Matrimony re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives all its force and vertue from the conſent of the parties married.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Fiftly,</hi> That the Act of ordination is attributed to Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, 1. Tim. 4. 14. And that the Apoſtles themſelves did not ordaine ordinary Miniſters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but by the concurrence and conſent of the people, Acts. 14. 23.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:14723:59"/>
               <hi>Sixtly,</hi> That in the primitive Church, which was governed by the common Counſell of the Preſbyters, before there were any Biſhops, the very firſt Biſhops were not ordained by Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops, which then were not, but by Miniſters.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seaventhly,</hi> That all the Councels, Degrees and Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Fathers objected to the contrary; proove nothing elſe, but that the Act and Right of Ordination partly by Cuſtome, and partly by humane Decrees, was given to the cheife Preſbyter or Biſhop after the Apoſtles time, not belonging to them by any divine right.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eightly,</hi> That the impoſition of hands is not abſolutely neceſſary to the eſſence of a Paſtor, no more then a Coronation to the eſſence of a King, or the celebration of a mariage, to the eſſence of a mariage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ninthly,</hi> That the power of Ordination, according to the Schoolemen and Canoniſts, is not an Act of Iuriſdiction, but of ſimple office, which Preſbyters may performe without any Commaund or Iuriſdiction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tenthly,</hi> That the Papiſts themſelves teach, that baptiſme conferred by any Chriſtian, though a lay man or woman; is good by reaſon of the neceſſity of it, that a ſimple Preſbyter by the common conſent of the Popiſh Doctors, may adminiſter the Sacrament of Confirmation, or conferre any of the greater Orders, and that all the Pontificians teach with unanimous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, that a Biſhop once conſecrated, although hee be a Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack, Heretick, excommunicate perſon or the like, may yet fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely ordaine others. Therefore a <hi>fortiori</hi> Godly Preſbyters, or the people and Church of Chriſt, may lawfully conferre or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders without the helpe or concurrence of a Biſhop.

                  <p>That power or authority which is common by divine right and inſtitution to Miniſters and Preſbyters as well as Biſhops, can neither proove Timothy or Titus to be Biſhops, or Biſhops to be ſuperior to Preſbyters or Miniſters in Juriſdiction, order, dignity or degree, <hi>Iure divino or humano.</hi>

               <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius long ſince argues againſt Aërius:</hi> As therefore in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall generations, a man begets a man, a beaſt a beaſt; and in Civill reſpects; a Gentleman begets a Gentleman; a peaſant a peaſant &amp;c. but not a man a beaſt; a beaſt a man, a Gentleman a peaſant, nor a peaſant a Gentleman; So Biſhops when they engender naturall children, beget them as men, not Biſhops, and their children are as much men as themſelves; when they ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually ordaine or engender Miniſters, they doe it onely as they are Miniſters not Biſhops, and thoſe they thus beget and ordaine, are as much Miniſters as themſelves; when they beget and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate Biſhops, they doe it as they are Biſhops, and thoſe thus begot and conſecrated are as much Biſhops as themſelves. Since therefore they ordaine Miniſters onely as they are Miniſters, not as Biſhops; as is cleare (elſe it were an unnaturall an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous, yea a monſtrous generation, to beget one of a different kinde, order, quality and degree from themſelves, and as much as if a man ſhould beget a beaſt, an horſe, or an Aſſe,) and ſince every Miniſter is as much as compleatly a Miniſter every way as the Biſhop, and Miniſters who ordaine him; how this propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition can be true; <hi>that the ordainer is higher in Juriſdiction, or different Iure divino in order or degree from the ordained,</hi> I cannot yet perceive, neither can our Prelates ever make it good. We know there are now divers Miniſters living, who not only bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, but likewiſe ordained ſome of our Biſhops to be Miniſters,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:14723:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and layd hands upon them with the Biſhop at the time of their ordination; yea every of our Biſhops, and Archbiſhops were firſt ordained Miniſters by Miniſters before they were made Biſhops or Arcbiſhops. And <hi>the first Biſhops that were ordained in the Church paramount Miniſters, were ordained Biſhops by Miniſters, as Hierom writes in his Epistle to Evagrius, and all ſince acknowlege out of him.</hi> Are theſe Miniſters there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in point of order, honor, juriſdiction, dignity and degree, greater then our Archbiſhops or Biſhops? If ſo, then the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie is at end; and the truth moſt apparant; that our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are greater and higher in degree then our Biſhops and Arch-biſhops, not our Biſhops and Archbiſhops higher greater then they, as they vainely contend. If not, then the Prelates maxime, on which they ground their Hierarchie, is moſt falſe, in that ſence in which they urge it; and ſo will yeild no ſupportation to their Hierarchie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I anſwer, that this Propoſition of theirs is war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by no Scripture, nor backed with any convincing rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon drawen from Scripture; therefore it prooves nothing either for Titus his Epiſcopall authority; or for Biſhops ſuperiority above other Miniſters, by any divine right, or inſtitution: As for that text of <hi>Hebr. 7. 7.

               </gap>meane, that they who or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine Miniſters onely inſtrumentally and Miniſterially as ſervants to Chriſt, his Church and the whole Congregation, (in whom the originall and primitive right of ordination is onely veſted) are greater in Iuriſdiction, order and degree, then thoſe who are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, as they doe and muſt doe; then the propoſition is moſt falſe and not juſtified by this Scripture, as the premiſed inſtances manifeſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Admit this propoſition true; that thoſe who are to ordaine others are greater in power and authority then the parties to be ordained, before their ordination fully executed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have an office, a calling of Miniſtery which the others want; in which ſenſe the propoſition may be true, yet it is not true; that the ordainers are greater in power, office and authority then the parties actually ordained after the ordination paſt and fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed; becauſe the very end of ordination, is to conferre the ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame office of Miniſtery on the parties ordained; which the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainers themſelves have in as large and ample manner as they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joye it; and the parties once ordained, are thereby made as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> abſolute Miniſters every way, in reſpect of their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and office, as any of thoſe who ordained them: though they were not ſo when they came to be ordained. This appeares by the examples of <note n="‡" place="margin">Acts. 1. 25 26. Gal. 2. 8. 9, 11. 14 1. Cor. 12. 28. 29. 2. Cor. 11. 5</note> 
               <hi>Mathias and Paul;</hi> before they were called and ordained to be Apoſtles, they were inferior to the other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles; but being once called and ordained Apoſtles, <hi>they became equall with the other Apoſtles in Apoſtolicall power, dignity, and

degree.</hi> So that from all theſe premiſes I may conclude, that this maxime of our Prelates, whereon they build their Epiſcopall Hierarchie, in that ſence they take it, is moſt falſe; and neither prooves Titus to be a Diocaeſan Biſhop, nor yet Biſhops to be ſuperior to other Miniſters in dignity, power, order, or degree, by divine right and inſtitution as they pretend they are.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally,</hi> Admit the propoſition true, yet it prooves but this; that Biſhops are ſuperior to thoſe Miniſters onely which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ordaine, (ſo that if they ordaine none they are ſuperior to none; not to thoſe ordained by others, which may be their equals notwithſtanding this allegation, ſeing they were not ordained by them; this propoſition extending onely to the act, not to the power of ordination.

All which being layd together, diſcovers the weakennes, the abſurdity of this our Prelates Theory, on which they build both their owne, &amp; Titus his hierarchy, which now fall quite to ruine with this their ſandy foundation, which I have here <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I anſwer: <hi>First,</hi> that neither <hi>S. Paul</hi> nor <hi>S.

Their teſtimonies therefore (who ſtile them onely <note n="‡" place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 6. 2. Tim. 4. 5. 1. Theſ. 3. 2.</note>

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> No Father ever ſtiles them, or either of them a Diocaeſan or ſole Biſhop of Crete or Epheſus, (the thing which ought to be prooved,) <hi>but Biſhops onely,</hi> as they ſtiled other Miniſters, <hi>the name, the office of Biſhops and Preſbyters being but one and the ſame, and promiſcuouſly uſed in the Apoſtles times; all Preſbyters being then called Biſhops, and all Biſhops Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; as is evident by</hi> Acts. 14. 23. c. 20. 17. 28.

               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Fathers uſe the word, <hi>Elders and Biſhops, promiſcuouſly;</hi> calling Elders Biſhops, and Biſhops Elders; Hence <hi>Papias the Auditor of S. John, and companion of Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carpus,</hi> writes thus <hi>in the Preface of his bookes;</hi>

               </gap> experience prooves it true for the moſt part, it ever raging more in the diſorderly ſuburbs of London, where they have uſually leaſt and worſt preaching, more then in the City, where is better governement, life and preaching. Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full preaching therefore being the cheife <note n="*" place="margin">Acts. 26. 18. c. 37. 38.</note>

If reaſon be not ſufficient, let late experience inſtruct us thus much. The Lectures of <hi>Chriſt Church, S. Martins</hi> and others in London, were put downe by the Biſhops this Peſtilence, to prevent the bringing of it into theſe Pariſhes: the very ſelfeſame weeke God ſends it unto them, and now it ſpreads among them much: But in <hi>S.

At <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> upon the firſt comming of the Plague, they gave over all preaching even forenoone and after-noone on the Lords day, thinking by this remedie to ceaſe it; (a preſident hardly paralleld in any age;) but what followed thereupon, the Bils ſince have beene doubled and trebled, and more have there died every day ſince, then did in a whole weeke before. This therefore is but a Prepoſterous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, and a vaine pretence to beguile little children, and fooles with all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> What place is there neere to Dedham from which that lecture ſhould draw the infection? were it in all or ſome of the neighbouring Pariſhes, there might be ſome colour for ſuch
